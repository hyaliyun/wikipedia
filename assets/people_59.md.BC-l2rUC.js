The church is staffed by Scalabrini Fathers, while the Our Lady of Pompeii School is staffed by Apostles of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. It is located across from Father Demo Square, which is named for the church's third pastor, Antonio Demo. The church was founded in 1892 as a national parish to serve Italian-American immigrants who settled in Greenwich Village, eventually becoming the American counterpart to the Shrine of Our Lady of the Rosary of Pompei in Italy and a shrine in its own right. The church has resided at its present location since 1926, when construction on its current edifice began. While it has remained a largely Italian American parish, the church has come to incorporate many other immigrant groups. History =Origins= The parish of Our Lady of Pompeii was founded in 1892. The origins of the parish lie in the arrival of Father Pietro Bandini, an Italian Jesuit priest, in New York City in 1890. His purpose was to establish a chapter of the Saint Raphael Society for the Protection of Italian Immigrants, an organization that sought to defend Italian immigrants from usury and labor exploitation. Bandini purchased a building at 113 Waverly Place to use its first-floor storefront as a chapel for the Society. He named it the Our Lady of Pompeii chapel, in honor of the Virgin Mary under her title of Our Lady of the Rosary of Pompeii. The first mass was said in the chapel on May 8, 1892. In addition to his spiritual ministry, Bandini assisted new immigrants with legal matters, assimilating to the United States, and finding work. The chapel was established within the territorial parish boundaries of St. Joseph's Church, whose pastor was Fr. Denis O'Flynn. He vehemently protested the establishment of another church near his, several having already been erected, that might draw parishioners away from his congregation. However, he also refused to allow Italians admittance to his church, which was mostly Irish in composition. To allay O'Flynn's fears of poaching parishioners, Bandini posted a notice on the entrance to his chapel that it was to serve only Italian Catholics. O'Flynn, nonetheless, accused Bandini of stealing parishioners before the archdiocese's chancery office within three months of the chapel's establishment. 210 alt=Black and white photograph of a building with columns, stairs leading to the street, and a neoclassical pediment Many immigrants who arrived from the northwestern Italian town of Chiavari to settle in Greenwich Village attended Our Lady of Pompeii chapel. Bandini requested that the community be elevated to the status of a parish in the Archdiocese of New York. The location of the church changed in 1895 when Bandini began renting a building at 214 Sullivan Street. It had originally been built in 1810 for an African American Baptist church and had more recently housed the Bethel Methodist Colored Church. Archbishop Michael Corrigan officially declared the community a parish in 1895. Rather than a territorial parish, Our Lady of Pompeii was a national parish, which served an ethnicity, namely Italians, rather than a geographic population. In this capacity, it became the second national parish in New York City for Italians, following St. Anthony of Padua Church. In 1896, Bandini left the church for Sunnyside Plantation in Arkansas to minister to the Italian workers there, and went on with the workers to found the city of Tontitown. Upon his departure, several unidentified priests impressed upon Archbishop Corrigan that he should close down the parish, but he decided against it. Bandini was succeeded as pastor of the church by Father Francesco Zaboglio in 1896, who held the role for only a year. In 1897, he was badly injured in a gas explosion in the church basement, which killed two other men employed by the parish and damaged the church building. With Zaboglio's retirement and return to Italy, Father Antonio Demo, a man prominent in the Italian-American community became the next pastor; he would serve in this position until 1935. While at the time of its founding, more than 80 percent of the church's parishioners hailed from Northern Italy, many of whom came specifically from the region of Liguria, by 1898 Southern Italians constituted a plurality of the congregation. On March 7, 1898, the parish of Our Lady of Pompeii was legally incorporated. The church on Sullivan Street was subsequently destroyed by fire, and the congregation relocated to a Greek Revival building at 210 Bleecker Street on May 8, 1898. The building had been originally commissioned in 1836 by a Unitarian Universalist church. Since 1883 it had been occupied by St. Benedict the Moor Catholic Church whose African American parish was moving north in Manhattan. Around this time, the parish received permission from Bartolo Longo, the founder of the Shrine of Our Lady of the Rosary of Pomepi in Italy, to promote itself as the American shrine to Our Lady of the Rosary of Pompeii. There is some indication that by around 1899 tension had begun to build between Our Lady of Pompeii and St. Anthony of Padua Church. While the latter was the older of the two Italian national parishes in the area, the Italians took a liking to the Scalabrians over the Franciscans (who ran St. Anthony's). For this reason, Our Lady of Pompeii's membership equaled that of St. Anthony of Padua within ten years of the former's founding. The parish was impacted by the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911, which took place nearby. Father Demo was active in consoling the mourning families. By 1917, the number of parishioners had grown to more than 20,000. For a time, Mother Cabrini taught at Our Lady of Pompeii. =Present church= alt=Three quarter view of a church at the corner of two streets. A bell tower rises atop the corner of the church In 1923, the City of New York decided to extend Sixth Avenue southward through the area occupied by the church and several dozen other buildings. Using eminent domain, the city seized, condemned, and eventually demolished the structures. Before demolition, Demo formed committees of parishioners to organize moving the parish to a new location. The pastor and the committees began purchasing land on the corner of Bleecker Street, eventually acquiring house numbers 17 through 25. There, they built a new church building, a rectory that opened in 1928, a parochial school that opened in 1930 staffed by the Missionary Zelatrices of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and a convent that opened in the 1950s. Father Demo personally selected Matthew W. Del Gaudio to be the architect of the church. The existing buildings on the land were cleared, and ground was broken for the new church in 1926. On New Year's Day 1928, during construction, a 3-year-old girl named Zita Triglia was killed when a 10-foot- long beam fell from the belfry scaffolding, knocking her from her father's arms. The church was completed in September of that year. It was dedicated on October 7, 1928, the feast day of Our Lady of the Rosary, in a solemn mass said by Cardinal Patrick Hayes with more than 2,000 worshipers in attendance. Father Demo was recalled to Rome in 1933 and died three years later; in his stead, John Marchegiani served as acting pastor and then pastor, and eventually as procurator. In 1933 American-born Italians represented a majority of the parish for the first time. When Marchegiani was recalled to Rome in 1937, he was succeeded by Ugo Cavicchi. He advanced the school, decorated the interior of the church, and welcomed the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, which assisted the poor and taught hundreds of Italian immigrants to take the American citizenship exam. During Father Mario Albanesi's pastorship from 1952 to 1964, the church property expanded with the purchase of houses on Carmine and Leroy Streets. Today, the church stands at 25 Carmine Street, at the northern corner of the intersection with Bleecker Street. It is directly across from Father Demo Square, which is located on the eastern corner of Carmine and Bleecker Streets. The church is staffed by priests who are Missionaries of St. Charles Borromeo (Scalabrini Fathers) and the school is staffed by sisters of the Apostles of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. While the church was founded for Italian immigrants and remained a parish primarily for Italian Americans for most of its history, in recent times its parishioners have included a range of immigrant groups. This is reflected by the fact that Mass is offered in English, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Tagalog. Since its second expansion in 2010, Our Lady of Pompeii Church has been located within the Greenwich Village Historic District. Architecture alt=Three-tiered bell tower with arches on each tier. At the top is a dome with a cross Del Gaudio's fa√ßade facing Carmine Street is built of limestone, while beige brick faces Bleecker Street. In total, the edifice cost over $1 million to construct. On the exterior, the Romanesque Revival church is accented by large Corinthian columns supporting a closed pediment over the entrance and a balustrade along the roofline. The fa√ßade is topped with an asymmetrically placed, three-story campanile enclosed by a copper dome and a finial cross. Inside this campanile, a new carillon was installed in 1988. It was Del Gaudio's intention to draw from the Romanesque style common to parishioners' homes and churches in Italy. For this reason he included shallow front steps, a flat fa√ßade that was close to the street, the domed sanctuary, and a campanile on the church, modeled after that of the Shrine of Our Lady of the Rosary of Pompei. On the roofline is a pediment topped by an acroterion statue of St. Charles Borromeo. =Interior furnishings= The interior of the church was decorated in the Romanesque Revival style, between 1934 and 1937, by Antonio D'Ambrosio, the founder of D'Ambrosio Ecclesiastical Art Studios. The nave is lined with polished marble Corinthian columns, above which is a frieze bearing a Latin inscription of the Hail Mary in golden letters. Above the frieze, within the barrel vault of the ceiling, are painted depictions of the Joyful Mysteries of the Rosary on the right side of the nave, and depictions of the Sorrowful Mysteries on the left side. On the ceiling are depictions of the Glorious Mysteries. The marble reredos contains a painting that is an exact replica of one in the Shrine of Our Lady in Pompei. It was given to the church in 1895 as a gift by Annie Leary. The painting is situated within a Romanesque arch and depicts the Virgin Mary holding the child Jesus who is handing a rosary to St. Dominic, while his mother hands a rosary to St. Catherine of Siena. This painting originally adorned the church's 210 Bleecker Street building and was cut and moved to its present location with the construction of the church. It was before this painting that many Italian emigrant parishioners would pray for safe travels before voyaging back to Naples or pray in thanksgiving upon returning to America. alt=Nave of a church, looking toward the altar. A large mural above the altar is framed by columns. Pews are in the foreground. To the left of the mural in the apsidal dome is a depiction of the Church Penitent, represented by souls in purgatory awaiting salvation. To the right is a depiction of the Church Triumphant, specifically the saints in heaven. Beneath the mural in the apse is another frieze that bears the Latin inscription: The largest painted accent in the interior is the mural in the semi-dome above the altar, which was created in 1937 and illustrates the Church Militant. The mural depicts the Virgin Mary and Jesus as a child in her lap, as she stands on a cloud, in front of the Sun. Mary is presenting St. Dominic, who is holding and contemplating the cross, with a rosary. St. Catherine of Siena looks on from the distance, as angels fly about them. The lower right corner of the mural, against a background of sky and sea, depicts a galleon in the naval Battle of Lepanto on October 7, 1571. The miraculous Spanish victory was attributed to divine intercession in response to prayer to Our Lady of the Rosary. One of the angels is handing a rosary to a soldier, which is depicted as the decisive weapon in the battle. Imagery of the Shrine of Our lady of the Rosary in Pompei, Italy is present above the battle, including the shrine's campanile. The religious are tending to poor immigrants, and a woman receives a rosary from a Franciscan friar, symbolizing that the Franciscans from St. Anthony of Padua Church were the first ministers to the Italian immigrants in New York. The mural also depicts St. Charles Borromeo in red, who is the patron saint of the Scalabrinians, and Blessed Giovanni Battista Scalabrini, their founder, as a bishop in white, their founder. Also visible is St. Martin de Porres holding a basket of roses, acknowledging the African American community that worshiped at Our Lady of Pompeii's previous church. This mural was removed in the 1970s, and replaced with less dramatic imagery consistent with the persuasion of the Second Vatican Council. It was later recreated by Antonio D'Ambrosio's son, Anthony D'Ambrosio, based on his father's original drawings. Shrine to alt=Kneeler in front of a statue holding a cross while clothed in red and gold garments. Behind it is a statue of a nun, all beneath a rounded arch Work on the stained glass windows that enclose either aisle began in 1928 and continued into the 1940s. They show scenes from the lives of the saints, the catechism, and the Gospel; in particular, the saints are shown in such a way that illustrates each of the Beatitudes with which they are associated. Individuals depicted in the windows include: St. Stephen, St. Catherine of Siena, St. John the Baptist, St. Peter, St. Paul, the Four Evangelists, and Pope Leo XIII with Mother Cabrini. Additional stained glass windows were added over the narthex in 1986. They depict the Exodus from Egypt, the Holy Family, Christopher Columbus giving thanks for reaching America, and Ellis Island, symbolizing the parish's immigrant and Italian heritage. In addition to architectural furnishings, the interior also contains a significant amount of statuary. To one side of the entrance is a shrine to Mother Cabrini, the patron saint of immigrants, and a statue of Jesus Nazareno, which is revered by Filipino pilgrims to the Pompei shrine in Italy. Additionally, there is a statue of San Gaetano that was gifted by devotees, a statue of Saint Jude that was bequeathed in 1955, a bust of Giovanni Scalabrini from 1955, and statues of St. Rose of Lima, St. Lucy, and Padre Pio. There is also a statue of St. Gerard that had resided in the maternity ward of St. Vincent's Hospital and was given as a gift by the Sisters of Charity upon the hospital's closing. The oldest statues in the church are those of the Blessed Mother and St. John the Evangelist, which date to the 1880s. The statues of St. Joseph and the Sacred Heart date to at least as early as 1909. The pipe organ at the rear of the church, designed by George Kilgen & Son, was installed at the time the church was built, incorporating many old pipes that may have been taken from the 1918 organ of the previous church at 214 Bleecker Street. It was expanded over the years, at one point incorporating pipes from a 1928 organ in the Immaculate Conception Church in Trenton, New Jersey.

It is an ‚Äòaesthetic‚Äô or ‚Äòlifestyle‚Äô theory of language and ethnicity proposed by the British sociolinguist John C. Maher. The theory of Metroethicity rejects cultural essentialism, and heroic ethnicity, in favour of a hybridized form of ethnicity that is utilised for aesthetic effect. In this perspective, language should not to be viewed as an enduring ethnic essence but a lifestyle ‚Äòaccessory.‚Äô It is portable. It functions best as an aspect of personal life- style. Metroethnicity is linked to Cool because cool is basically an aesthetic phenomenon. Cool actively disconnects the ‚Äònatural‚Äô linkage that is often made between ethnicity and language. Cool is both an attitude as well as a facet of personal action. This post-ethnic stance is illustrated by a young Ainu person in northern Japan: ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt speak Ainu‚Ä¶be nice to speak it‚Ä¶but..anyway...I speak Italian ‚Äòcause that‚Äôs where I want to be..love Italian stuff‚Ä¶I‚Äôm training to be an Italian chef.‚Äù (Maher 2006). In such person-driven identity traditional language is optional -not rejected but bracketed. This view of language may be confrontational a person who insists language and ethnicity should line up. The ethnic view fosters ethnic allegiance, even orthodoxy. By contrast, \\"Metroethnicity is a kind of post ethnicity state whereby both we play with ethnicity (not necessarily our own) for aesthetic effect. It involves cultural crossing, self-definition made up of borrowing and bricolage of blurred ‚Äòidentities‚Äô, what one might term ‚Äòmetroethnicity‚Äô. The operating system of this metroethnicity is ‚ÄòCool‚Äô‚Äù (Maher 2005).  References  Maher, J. C. (2005) 'Metroethnicity, Language, and the Principle of Cool'.

He was born in 1927 and died in 1974 at the hands of paramilitary death squads. His interest in politics stemmed from his experiences in the Guatemalan Revolution of 1944-1945, which were marked by his immersion in leftist politics. He was soon named Secretary General of the Guatemalan Alliance of Democratic Youth. At the same time, Alvarado engaged in notable cultural and literary production, mainly through the Saker-ti (\\"Dawn\\" in Kaqchikel) group, of which he had been a founder. Saker-T√≠ was a collective of young writers committed to democratic values and to revaluing Guatemala's native cultural legacy. The group wound up joining the Communist Party en masse,Cardoza y Arag√≥n, Lu√≠s. El r√≠o, novela de caballer√≠as (Fondo de Cultura Econ√≥mica, 1986), page 635ss. and in 1949 Alvarado the group was appointed to the Central Committee of the party and later to its Political Commission.Rosales Rom√°n, Ricardo. \\"Los golpes que duelen e indignan no doblegan, fortalecen\\", essay posted at Albedr√≠o.org: Revista electr√≥nica de discusi√≥n y propuesta social, 20 December 2006. Online. (Accessed 20 May 2014) On 17 June 1954, the democratically elected government of reformist Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown in a CIA engineered coup d'√©tat that ended the Guatemalan Revolution. It was carried out by reactionary expatriates who entered Guatemala from Honduran territory, with US support and coordination.Schlesinger, Stephen & Stephen Kinzer. Bitter Fruit: The Untold Story of the American Coup in Guatemala (Anchor Books, 1983).Immerman, Richard H. The CIA in Guatemala: The Foreign Policy of Intervention (University of Texas, 1982). After the fall of the democratic government, one of the first measures passed by the new regime was the banning of the Party of Labor. Alvarado was then forced into exile, first in Ecuador and later in Mexico. Alvarado soon returned to Guatemala and managed to live relatively quietly until he was again persecuted and jailed. An international campaign secured his release and subsequent return to exile in Mexico. Alvarado-who was at this time serving as Secretary General of the Guatemalan Party of Labour (as the Communist Party had been renamed in 1952), after its previous Secretary General had been captured and executed at the orders Pres. Carlos Arana- returned to his homeland in 1974. He would not live out the year. On 20 December 1974, Huberto Alvarado was wounded and captured by government forces. The next day, his tortured and mutilated body was dumped on the outskirts of Guatemala City.

The road also connects to Dallas Love Field and provides access to the terminals there. This road also once was a major thoroughfare through central Dallas and the Turtle Creek area in the early 1900s. Dallas Area Rapid Transit bus route 39 traverses much of the length of this road.  Route description  The road's southern end is at North Field Street near the Victory Park neighborhood just north of Downtown Dallas. It travels northeast for two blocks, turning directly north at Akard Street while also becoming one-way northbound for two blocks past this. At Olive Street, it becomes two-way again, and leaves the downtown area for Uptown Dallas. It then passes under the Katy Trail, over Turtle Creek, and Turtle Creek Boulevard joins it about a block north from there. The two streets run multiplexed for two blocks on the west side of the creek, then split. Turtle Creek Boulevard continues north-northeast, while Cedar Springs Road turns northwest at Bowen Street. From here, the road runs through one of the financial cores of Dallas, and intersects with Oak Lawn Avenue. The road then cuts through the Oak Lawn neighborhood, and intersects with Wycliff Avenue. The road then crosses over the Dallas North Tollway. Farther northwest, the road intersects with Inwood Road and a few shopping centers. The road finally intersects with Mockingbird Lane and widens to six lanes, where it approaches the terminal at Dallas Love Field and its termination point. The portion north of Mockingbird leading to the airport terminal was renamed Herb Kelleher Way in 2014 in honor of the founder of Southwest Airlines.  History  William Grigsby, a veteran of the Texas Revolution, sold 320 acres to John Cole in 1846 for $1 per acre. Cole built a store and other businesses on the property and established his medical practice. The community became known as Cedar Springs for its free flowing springs and cedar tree grove. It became a part of Dallas County that same year. On Memorial Day 2014, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., 1.25 miles of Cedar Springs Road was blocked off, along with parts of Routh Street and Harwood Street to create a ciclov√≠a, a pedestrian-only road.

Besides the Camry, the K platform was used on minivans, crossovers and luxury sedans. This platform was larger than the front-wheel-drive MC and New MC platforms, but less upscale than the N and New N platforms designed for rear- wheel drive luxury applications.

A simple commercial building in the village's downtown, it held a prominent place in the community and surrounding region. Named a historic site in the 1980s, it was destroyed by arson in 2010.

On the upper stories, each of the five was divided into three smaller bays, and each floor featured similarly sized windows in each of the fifteen smaller bays. To the side, narrower windows faced an alley, with a metal fire escape providing access from the third floor. Early history Franklin Township was organized in 1854,The History of Tuscarawas County, Ohio. Chicago: Beers, 1884. almost fifty years after settlers first built their cabins within its present boundaries. The first village, Milton, was platted in 1816, but its proximity to Wilmot was its ruin, and the township therefore had no more settlements until Strasburg was platted in 1828. In its early years, Strasburg was frequented by rowdy characters of poor reputation, but by the late nineteenth century, it had settled into a stable and quiet trading center for the surrounding area. In such a community, Rudy and G.A. Garver founded a store in 1866, using a log building as their premises. After a newer building was constructed in 1875, they moved into it, and an 1884 history noted their presence among seventeen other village businesses. The Garvers remained in their sturdier building until 1902, when it was destroyed by fire, but undaunted they laid plans for its replacement. Rather than simply rebuilding what was destroyed, they arranged for the construction of a far more extensive operation, and upon its completion later in the year, the Garver Brothers Store sold everything from dry goods to furniture, groceries to shoes, and pianos to carpets. As no other store in the region offered such a wide range of goods, the brothers touted it as the \\"World's Largest Country Store\\", and before long their clientele extended far past Ohio's boundaries. Final years In 1980, the Garver Brothers Store was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It qualified for inclusion based on its r√¥le in local history, as it had long occupied a prominent place in the community's identity, and the Garvers' wide range of products and long-distance clientele had made Strasburg a regional commercial center. For the next thirty years, it retained its central place in the community, even as it was converted into a flea market; the building's new function continued to bring shoppers from long distances,\\"Arson: Intentionally Set Flames Ravage Historic Tuscarawas County Landmark, Other Sites\\", WOIO, 2010-10-14.

Everything came to a sudden end on the night of 13‚Äì14 October 2010, when fire completely destroyed the building.

FlowVella allows users to create, publish and share presentations through their cloud-based SaaS system. FlowVella allows embedding of text, images, PDFs, video and gallery objects in easy linkable screens, defining modern interactive presentations. FlowVella grew out of Treemo Labs.  History  FlowVella launched as 'Flowboard' on April 18, 2013 after being built for almost a year. FlowVella was incubated out of Treemo Labs, which had years of experience building native apps for iPhone, iPad and Android devices. FlowVella is an iPad app and Mac app where users create, view, publish and share interactive presentations. Presentations are viewable on flowvella.com through a web-based viewer on any device or through the FlowVella native iPad app or Mac app. FlowVella has been featured by Apple in the App Store several times and included in many promotions like \\"@Work collaboration\\" and others. Flowboard rebrands to FlowVella on December 18, 2014 after a trademark dispute.  Presentation format  FlowVella is an interactive presentation format where instead of single directional slides, presentations are made up of linkable screens with embeddable media and content objects. While 'Flows' can be exported to PDF, they all have a web address and are meant to be viewed via a web browser or the FlowVella native applications.  Revenue model  FlowVella uses the freemium model for its presentation apps. Free users can make 4 public presentations with limited number of screens/slides, but most features are available to try out the software. In 2016, FlowVella introduced a second paid plan called PRO which includes team sharing, tracking and newly introduced 'Kiosk Mode' that launched in March of 2017.  Features  FlowVella is a native iPad app and Mac app which has advantages over web based tools. All downloaded presentations can be viewed offline, without an Internet connection. This includes videos which are enabled by cacheing the video files into memory. For students, teachers, sales people and all users, this is extremely important because this prevents having a presentation fail because of lack of an Internet connection. Beyond the offline capabilities, there is a trend to build native applications versus HTML5 as noted by Facebook and LinkedIn both rebuilding their mobile apps as 100% native applications.

Melas directed his troops with more skill and his army drove the French off the field, inflicting heavy losses. The War of the Second Coalition action represented the last major French effort in Italy during 1799. The municipality of Genola is located in the region of Piedmont in northwest Italy a distance of north of Cuneo and south of Turin. Championnet became the army commander after Barth√©lemy Catherine Joubert's death in the French defeat at Novi in August. His aim was to keep the fortress of Cuneo under French control. In November, both Championnet and Melas advanced and their armies collided at Genola. The French were forced to retreat into the Alps, leaving Cuneo to be besieged and captured on 3 December 1799. The badly-fed and clothed French army was ravaged by a typhus epidemic during the winter; the disease claimed the life of Championnet and many others. Background Their armies' defeats in Italy and Germany during 1799 weakened the French Directory and resulted in the Coup of 30 Prairial VII (18 June 1799). France's post-coup leaders sent Barth√©l√©my Catherine Joubert to command the 40,713-man Army of Italy with orders to attack. Joubert was to be supported on his left by the Army of the Alps under Jean √âtienne Championnet. Upon arrival, Joubert's generals advised him to wait for Championnet's troops to join them, but the new commander felt bound by his instructions to launch an immediate offensive. In the Battle of Novi on 15 August 1799, the Army of Italy was defeated by the larger Austro-Russian army under Alexander Suvorov and Joubert was killed. The Allies failed to pursue; the Austrians were more interested in besieging the Italian fortresses. Suvorov and the Russian corps were soon ordered to march to Switzerland, leaving 178,253 Austrian soldiers holding Italy. Jean Victor Marie Moreau reorganized the French army until Championnet could arrive to take over. Meanwhile, Championnet marched from Grenoble around 8 August 1799 with 25,000 troops split into four groups. The northernmost column crossed the Little St Bernard Pass to threaten Aosta and Ivrea while the next column south traversed the Mont Cenis Pass to Susa in order to menace Turin. Championnet accompanied a column of 8,000‚Äì9,000 men that crossed the Col de Montgen√®vre and moved southeast to Fossano via Pinerolo. The southernmost column marched over the Maddalena Pass (Col de l'Argenti√®re) into the Valle Stura di Demonte in the direction of Cuneo. On 16 September Paul Grenier with 8,000 defeated 5,000 Austrians under Friedrich Heinrich von Gottesheim at Fossano, inflicting 1,000 casualties for the loss of 200 men. Two days later at Savigliano, 20,000 Austrians led by Michael von Melas fell on Grenier's column and beat him, inflicting 2,000 casualties on the French while losing only 400. The French lost both Fossano and Savigliano and fell back, the other columns retreating as well. The northern column under Guillaume Philibert Duhesme withdrew after being blocked by Fort Bard. Operations Laurent Saint-Cyr Championnet assumed command of the Army of Italy from Moreau at Genoa on 22 September. The Army of the Alps was absorbed by its sister army at that time. Championnet wished to abandon Genoa in order to shorten the long line he had to defend, but the French government refused to allow it. There were 63,657 French troops available, but only 53,581 if garrisons are excluded. The right wing under Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr had 16,657 soldiers in the divisions of Jean Henri Dombrowski, Pierre Garnier de Laboissi√®re, Sextius Alexandre Fran√ßois de Miollis and Fran√ßois Watrin. Championnet personally led the 15,215-strong center, consisting of the divisions of Louis Lemoine and Claude Perrin Victor at Mondov√¨. Grenier led the 19,615-man left wing near Cuneo, made up of his own and Duhesme's divisions plus a 2,056-strong reserve under Andr√© Calvin. Duhesme was also charged with holding the Little St Bernard and Mont Cenis passes. Opposing the French were Johann von Klenau who faced Genoa, Paul Kray in the Aosta valley and Melas who threatened Cuneo. In Cuneo province, Genola is located at the three-way intersection south of Savigliano. Saint-Cyr's wing successfully held its own against the Austrians near Genoa. Watrin with 7,000 troops beat Klenau with 5,000 on the 13th at Bracco, a village east of Sestri Levante. The French inflicted 1,200 casualties, mostly captured, on their foes while sustaining losses of 100. This was part of an operation that started on the 12th in which French troops from Torriglia pressed back Klenau's outposts in the mountains east of Genoa. After eight days, they withdrew into their previous lines. On 24 October 1799 Saint-Cyr defeated Andreas Karaczay in the Second Battle of Novi. Karaczay's 5,000 troops lost 300 killed and wounded while the French captured 1,000 men and four guns. The French lost 400 killed and wounded plus 800 captured out of 12,000. In the sequel, Saint-Cyr pushed threateningly to the north, so Kray was sent with a strong force including 2,800 cavalry and 25 artillery pieces to press him back. The French right wing commander pulled back to the heights behind Novi and refused to budge when Kray tried to maneuver him out of position. On 6 November in the Third Battle of Novi, Kray attacked the hills in four columns and fell into a clever ambush. The French troops made a fighting withdrawal, drawing the Austrians after them. Suddenly, Saint-Cyr's masked artillery opened up as Dombrowski's division bored in from the flank. The French drove the Austrians off the heights but Saint-Cyr was too prudent to pursue into the plain where the enemy's superior cavalry and artillery waited. The French sustained 400 casualties out of 11,000 men while inflicting a loss of 1,000 men and five guns on their 12,000 opponents. Farther west there were clashes at Saluzzo and Pinerolo. On 16 October 1799 the divisions of Victor and Fran√ßois Muller attacked the Austrians at Beinette with serious losses on both sides. Finally, Melas gave up his attempted siege of Cuneo and pulled back. Lemoine's division was involved in actions at Mondov√¨ on 27‚Äì28 October. On 31 October 1799, Melas with 15,000 soldiers drubbed Grenier with 7,000 at Centallo. The French suffered 1,000 casualties while the Austrians lost only 200 and captured four guns. However, the French gradually pressed forward toward Fossano. Duhesme fought an Austrian force at Pinerolo on 1 November and the next day the French captured Mondov√¨. Forces Jean Championnet The French Army of Italy under Championnet and his chief of staff Louis Gabriel Suchet included the infantry divisions of Duhesme, Grenier, Lemoine and Victor and the cavalry division of Antoine Richepanse. Since Grenier was acting as left wing commander Muller led his division. Muller's 8,000-man division was made up of the 3rd, 8th and 17th Light Infantry Demi-brigades, the 10th, 31st, 40th, 47th, 104th and 106th Line Infantry Demi-brigades and 600 sabers from the 10th Hussars. The infantry brigadiers were Claude Cl√©ment, Jean Dominique Compans and Jean Davin while Julien Augustin Joseph Mermet led the cavalry. Duhesme's 8000-strong division comprised the 7th and 28th Light and the 29th, 80th, 87th and 107th Line Infantry Demi-brigades and the 11th Hussars. The brigade commanders were Georges Kister, Joseph Mathurin Fidele Lesuire and Claude-Fran√ßois Malet. Victor's 8,469-man division counted the 2nd Battalion of the 26th Light and the 26th, 33rd, 35th, 39th, 92nd, 93rd, 99th and 105th Line Infantry Demi- brigades. The brigadiers were Charles Louis Dieudonn√© Grandjean, Jean Louis Gaspard Josnet de Laviolais and Pierre Poinsot de Chansac. Lemoine's 7,829-strong division included the 5th Light and 17th Line Demi-brigades, the 34th Line under Philibert Fressinet, the 63rd Line under Gaspard Am√©d√©e Gardanne, the 74th Line under Bertrand Clausel and 114 detached hussars. The 20th Light under Jean Mathieu Seras was not engaged nor was the 30th Line. Richepanse's 1,200 troopers were from the 1st, 14th and 21st Cavalry and the 2nd, 3rd, 9th and 14th Chasseurs √† Cheval. The numbers listed above add up to 33,498 soldiers. A second source asserted that the Austrians enjoyed a numerical advantage, giving 20,000‚Äì25,000 for the French total, apparently excluding Lemoine. Two additional sources stated that only 15,000 French were engaged at Genola. Michael von Melas The Austrian army under Melas and his chief of staff Anton von Zach was composed of the infantry divisions of Peter Karl Ott von B√°tork√©z, Anton Ferdinand Mittrowsky and Anton von Elsnitz, the cavalry division of Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein, Gottesheim's vanguard and Hannibal Sommariva's independent brigade. Ott's 7,632-strong division was made up of brigades under Karl Philippi von Weidenfeld and Franz Xaver Johann von Auersperg. Weidenfeld's 3,404-man brigade included the G√∂rschen, Hohenfeld, Neny, Pers, P√©rtussy and Weissenwolf Grenadier Battalions. Auersperg led 4,228 soldiers from full-strength Infantry Regiments Archduke Charles Nr. 3 and Stuart Nr. 18. Mittowsky's Division had only the 2,684-man brigade of Lelio Spannocchi, consisting of weak Infantry Regiments Reisky Nr. 13, Terzi Nr. 16 and Joseph Mittrowsky Nr. 40. Elsnitz commanded 8,010 men in the brigades of Karl von Adorj√°n, Antoine-Fran√ßois-Armand Mignot de Bussy and Friedrich Joseph Anton von Bellegarde. Adorj√°n directed 2,768 troops from Infantry Regiments ex-Kheul Nr. 10 and Alvinczi Nr. 19, Bussy led 1,467 men from Infantry Regiment N√°dasdy Nr. 39 and Bellegarde had 3,775 soldiers from Infantry Regiments Gyulai Nr. 32 and Sztaray Nr. 33. Liechtenstein led 3,488 troopers in the cavalry brigades of Johann Nobili and Nikolaus Joseph Palffy von Erd√∂d. Nobili supervised 1,765 sabers in Light Dragoon Regiments Archduke John Nr. 3 and Karaczay Nr. 4 while Palffy directed 1,723 sabers in Light Dragoon Regiments Wurttemberg Nr. 8 and Lobkowitz Nr. 10. Gottesheim's 4,665-man vanguard included Light Dragoon Regiment Kaiser Nr. 1 and Infantry Regiments ex-Huff Nr. 8 and Prince of Orange Nr. 15, a total of 843 horse and 3,822 foot. Sommariva's 2,756-strong brigade consisted of Hussar Regiment Archduke Joseph Anton Nr. 2, Light Dragoon Regiment Levenehr Nr. 14, Light Infantry Battalion ex-Otto Nr. 7 and the 1st Battalion of Grenz Infantry Regiment Szluiner Nr. 4, a total of 1,726 cavalry and 1,030 infantry. Franz B√∂gner led the artillery and Joseph Radetzky von Radetz led the engineers for a combined total of about 1,000 gunners and pioneers. Altogether, there are 30,235 men listed above. A second source listed 29,000 Austrians. A third source credited the Austrians with 34,000 troops including 6,000 cavalry. This total counted six battalions not listed above that were under Christoph von Lattermann. Battle Countryside near Murazzo On 3 November, Duhesme seized Saluzzo, Victor crossed the Stura River to take Murazzo and Carr√π was occupied. Championnet decided to launch a major attack on his opponent the next day. Lemoine on the right at Carr√π north of Mondov√¨ was instructed to operate on the Austrian left flank while Victor on the right center moved against Fossano. Grenier with the left center was to attack east through Savigliano toward Marene. Duhesme was ordered to march from Pinerolo to Saluzzo in order to turn the Austrian right flank. On 4 November, the battle of Genola or Fossano was fought. Peter Karl Ott Championnet assumed that his opponent was about to pull back, but Melas had made up his mind to fight and had his army well concentrated. To guard the supply line from Turin, Melas directed Konrad Valentin von Kaim to shift Lattermann's troops to Racconigi in the north. The Austrian commander ordered Ott with the left flank division to march from Marene seize Savigliano. Mittrowsky with the center was also directed to advance on Savigliano. On the left, Elsnitz was directed to attack from Fossano toward Genola. Assisted by the Fossano garrison, Gottesheim would feint toward Murazzo and Maddelena. (Murazzo is southwest of Fossano on the west bank of the Stura while Morozzo is south of Fossano on the east bank.) Both armies were in motion early in the day. The first contact occurred when the divisions of Ott and Grenier violently collided near Marene. The Austrian cavalry intervened and pushed the French back somewhat, but the battle still hung in the balance. Mittrowsky's troops appeared unexpectedly, tipping the balance and driving the French from Savigliano. On the other flank, Victor attacked Fossano as Elsnitz was repulsed three times from Genola. Richepanse launched a series of successful cavalry charges in support of Victor. General Adorj√°n was killed at about this time. Mittrowsky moved from Savigliano to Genola and helped drive Victor's men from the town. Ott pursued Grenier's beaten division in a deeper envelopment of the French army toward Vottignasco. Championnet authorized Victor to retreat to Centallo. Gottesheim was unable to dislodge Victor's right wing near Murazzo, but Victor's left wing fell back to Ronchi, just north of Cuneo. By the end of the day the Austrian pursuit had reached a line running from Villafalletto on the west, Centallo in the center and Murazzo on the east. Meanwhile, Duhesme marched from Saluzzo with 3,000 soldiers and belatedly arrived at Savigliano in the late afternoon. Melas assigned the brigades of Sommariva and Lattermann to face the threat. Blocked by more numerous enemies, Duhesme retreated to Saluzzo. That day Lemoine advanced to Bene Vagienna east of Fossano, but Melas ignored him and focused on crushing Grenier and Victor. On 5 November, the Austrian commander sent Ott against Ronchi where he captured 600 French soldiers. At Murazzo, Elsnitz and Gottesheim drove Victor's rear guard against the Stura, compelling 1,500 men to surrender and others to drown in attempting to swim the river. Grenier abandoned Fort Demonte and retreated toward the Col de Tende. The Austrian pursuit swept up another 1,500 demoralized Frenchmen as prisoners. Championnet gathered Lemoine's men and Victor's survivors at Mondov√¨, hoping to interfere with any attempt to besiege Cuneo. Followed by Lattermann, Duhesme withdrew far to the northwest at Oulx and Susa. Results Louis-Gabriel Suchet The French lost 3,400 killed and wounded plus 4,200 men and five guns captured. The Austrians sustained losses of 2,150 killed and wounded and 250 captured. Wishing to besiege Cuneo, Melas moved against the nearby French forces. On 10 November Ott drove Richepanse from Borgo San Dalmazzo back to Limone Piemonte. Melas ordered Liechtenstein and Mittrowski to attack Mondov√¨. On 13 November 1799, 14,000 Austrians attacked Championnet's 9,000 at Mondov√¨. Casualties were about even at about 500 on each side. Championnet pulled his troops back to Ormea and Garessio and set up his headquarters at Finale Ligure on the coast. On 15 November, the Austrians drove the French from Limone and over the Col de Tende. Having cleared the French from Piedmont, Melas directed Liechtenstein to lay siege to Cuneo on the 18th. The city was cut off from the waters of the Stura on 21 November and trenches were begun on the night of the 26th. On 2 December, the Austrian guns opened their bombardment, breaching the defenses and burning down many houses. On 3 December the garrison commander Cl√©ment surrendered the surviving 3,000 troops, 187 cannons and 14,000 cwt of gunpowder. Prince Liechtenstein After the battle, the Army of Italy was hemmed in between the crests of the Ligurian Alps on the north and the Ligurian Sea on the south. During the course of the war, the Italian Riviera had been denuded of supplies so provisions had to be shipped from France in order to sustain the army. The supply convoys were often held up by foul winds or British warships. On top of this, the soldiers had not been paid in five months and their clothing and shoes were worn out. In these conditions, many men deserted but soon the soldiers broke out in mutiny. In one incident, Championnet and Suchet were faced with 3,000 mutineers who had only received rations on six days out of the last thirty. They somehow convinced the soldiers to return to duty. The men of the Genoa garrison announced to Saint- Cyr that they were marching back to France. The general dissuaded them by pointing out that they would certainly starve to death on the long march along the Riviera. Fortunately, supply ships reached Genoa just in time. Watrin's division abandoned its positions, leaving only their officers and sous- officiers holding Bocchetta Pass. The men were only persuaded to stop by the news that the Genoa garrison had decided to remain; they got back before the Austrians could seize the pass. Championnet was in despair at the misery of his men. On 31 December 1799, Championnet got news that the government accepted his resignation and appointed Andr√© Mass√©na to lead the Army of Italy. The following day he became sick and the senior general Jean-Antoine Marbot assumed temporary command. For a week, Championnet's illness did not seem particularly severe and he granted leave to Suchet on 3 January. However, he rapidly declined and died on 9 January 1800. The general was so impoverished that his staff had to pay for his burial at Antibes. Championnet was a victim of typhus, which had broken out in Nice in mid-October 1799. The disease was first seen in a military hospital and quickly spread to the army and civilians. The number of deaths soared so that disposal of the numerous corpses became a problem. The epidemic reached its peak at the end of January and only began to recede in March 1800. Commentary Championnet saw that he needed to evacuate Genoa in order to shorten his long front, but the French Directory refused to consider it. Consequently, the French commander could not collect enough troops to defeat Melas near Cuneo. The French government thoroughly plundered Italy yet neglected to feed, clothe or pay its soldiers stationed there. Championnet should have advanced into Piedmont in one powerful force instead of moving in four widely separated columns. At Genola he spread his army across a broad front, while Melas had his army concentrated under his immediate control. He unwisely chose to fight a pitched battle in the plains against an enemy that greatly outnumbered him in cavalry. Napoleon wrote of Championnet, \\"He distinguished himself in the Army of Sambre-et- Meuse, where his had been one of the principal divisions; there he had been imbued with the false principles of war with which Jourdan's plans were directed. He was brave, full of zeal, active, devoted to his country; he was a good general of division, an indifferent commander-in-chief.\\" Notes References   * See also * Category:Battles of the War of the Second Coalition Category:Battles of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:Battles involving Austria Category:Battles involving France Category:Conflicts in 1799 Category:1799 in Italy ","title":"Battle of Genola"},{"id":"43075061","text":"Dom√´n is a village situated in the central plains of Albania's Western Lowlands region.

History  Japanese soldiers landed on Agho during World War II, although they did not stay as they had a garrison in nearby Bagungon Island. The island is currently owned by the Villarias clan, who own the island's resort and sari-sari store. In 1980 or 81, a couple arrived on Agho Island with the claim that the island has been given to them by then-president Ferdinand Marcos. This couple, variously American or Australian and named as Thomas and Terry Cook or Kurt, hired locals to build a cottage on Agho. At first, relations between the couple and the locals were friendly; however, after the cottage was completed the couple posted an armed guard and dogs on the property to keep out intruders. Tensions between the couple and the locals grew and eventually the authorities were called in. On 19 August 1988, Narcom (Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency) found 1,000 plants on the property that were believed to be cocoa plants, although some officials disputed this claim. The couple had left the island two years earlier, after Marcos's fall from power.  Transport  Agho is a 30-minute pumpboat ride from Concepcion.

The Association of Alawiyyin or Alawiyyin League) is an Indonesian Islamic organization engaged in social movements. In general, the organization is an exclusive association of Hadhrami people of Ba 'Alawi sada families. The organization was established on December 27, 1928 CE or 1346 AH, not long after the Soempah Pemoeda (Youth Pledge) October 28, 1928. The organization has a sub-organization called al-Maktab al-Daimi given task to collect, verify and maintain genealogies of Ba 'Alawi sada and print pedigree passes to prove the ancestry of individuals around the world. History Although Jamiat Kheir had been granted permission and founded, The Dutch East Indies government still had concern and suspicion about its activity. Later, the Jamiat Kheir turned into a fully educational-only organization, so Arab Indonesians of Ba 'Alawi sada decided to build another organization to continue the original tasks of Jamiat Kheir, which is social engagements. It was also intended as a body to maintain and enhance the dignity of Muslims in Indonesia, particularly Alawiyyin family through social efforts and Dawah, Islamic education and moral guidance through good deeds and Islamic brotherhood in the unity of the nation and state. Two months after the Youth Pledge, Alawiyin figures requested a permission to the Dutch Government to establish the new association, al-Rabithatoel al-Alawijah (as it was spelled at the time) which was recorded in the notary deed number 6 by A.H. Van Ophuijsen dated January 16, 1928. The request was approved by the Dutch government on December 27, 1928 CE (1346 AH), which was signed by the Gerard Rudolph Erdbrink (Secretary of the Dutch East Indies Government; [1881-1954]) with the second permission issued on November 27, 1929. Many of the management members of this newly created organization were also members of Jamiat Kheir. Some founders of the al-Rabithah who were also administrators of Jamiat Kheir, among others were Muhammad bin Abdurrahman bin Ali Shahab, Idrus bin Ahmad Shahab, Ali bin Ahmad Shahab (brother of Idrus), and Abubakar bin Muhammad al- habshi. The first student financed by the al-Rabithah to graduate from Jamiat Kheir was Syarifah Qamar of Daarul Aitam, where she received scholarship of 15 guilders a month. Just a year after the establishment of the organization at the central level, in 1929 there were branches of the organization erected in Pekalongan, Semarang, Solo, Surabaya, Tuban, Gresik, Bangil, Palembang, and Bondowoso. In addition to these branches, regions which could not meet the conditions to establish branches soon then established representative offices. In the same year, had stood representative offices of al-Rabithah in Makassar, Ende, Probolinggo, Cianjur, Sukorejo, Tulungagung, Jombang, Jember, Mojosari, Lumajang, Malang, Sumenep, and Banyuwangi. Although still at young age, al- Rabithah was able to align itself with other older organizations. In 1930, for example, al-Rabithah received an invitation to attend the Muslim Youth Conference. al-Rabithah was represented by Alwi bin Thahir al-Haddad who gave an interesting lecture which was then printed and distributed to the conference participants. Rabithah was also active in the Islamic Conference in Surabaya and collaborated with Muhammadiyah to hold Mawlid. In line with its policy, the Rabithah was also responsive to social and contemporary issues at the time, such as fundraising and humanitarian aid for victims of the eruption of Mount Merapi (1930), famine in Palestine, and the construction of mosques and orphanages orphans in various regions. al-Rabithah al-Alawiyyah plays important roles on national interests individually and collectively through formal education institutions, Islamic boarding schools, informal religious gatherings, assembly of Dhikr (remembrance), and through training centers spread all over the country. It also participates in educating the mature life of the nation, economic development of the people as well as instill a nationalism. Besides giving scholarships, every year the organization distributes zakat to needy people. The main source of fund for the organization is through community contributions, as well as through for-profit business. Founders =Jakarta Branch= The first Board Members of this association were also the founders, namely: Muhammad bin Abdurrahman bin Shihab (Chairman), Abubakar bin Abdullah al-Attas (Vice Chairman I), Abdullah bin Ali al-Aydarus (Vice Chairman II), Abubakar bin Muhammad al-Habshi (Treasurer I), Idrus bin Ahmad bin Shahab (Treasurer II), Ahmad bin Abdullah al-Seggaf (Secretary), Ali bin Abdurrahman al-Habshi (Trustee), Alwi bin Muhammad al-Haddad (Trustee), Alwi bin Thohir al-Haddad (Trustee), Abdullah bin Umar al-Zahir (Trustee), Abdullah bin Abubakar al-Habshi (Trustee) and Salim bin Ahmad Bawazir (Trustee). The first chairman of this organization was Alwi bin Thahir al-Haddad. =Solo Branch= Although the first Rabithah was established in Batavia, the approval came later after the Branch in Solo was established on October 7, 1928 (1 Jumada al-awwal 1346 AH). The founders in Solo were Husein Bin Alwi Bin Shahab, Ibrahim bin Agil al-Seggaf, Muhammad bin Segaf al-Seggaf, Ali bin Salim Aidid, Eidrus bin Muhammad al-Jufri, Alwi bin Ali al-Habshi, Ali bin Muhammad al-Habshi, Hasan bin Husein al-Seggaf, Ali bin Syech bin Shahab, Salim bin Basri al-Seggaf, Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Husein al-Seggaf, Husin bin Abdurrahman al-Seggaf, Abdullah bin Abdul-Rahman bin Sumaith, Husein bin Abdullah al-Habshi, and Ahmad bin Ali bin Muhammad Makarim. Shortly, the organization built a school called Madrasah Ibtidaiyya al-Rabithah al-Alawiyyah in Pasar Kliwon District. At first, the school engaged in Islamic Studies, Arabic language, and some limited secular subjects. For the reason of patriotism, on March 9, 1966, the school was renamed to Islamic Education Foundation of Diponegoro, where it remains in use today. Organization The management structure of year 2011-2016 consists of an Advisory Board, a Supervisory board, board of directors and a list of managing directors for each chapter: Venture Empowerment, Organization, Inter- Institutional Relations, Public Relations & Media, Dawah, Education and Training, and Affairs of Social Welfare. The organization has branches spread out from west to east of Indonesia. The office was originally located in Jamiat Kheir complex in Tanah Abang, but later moved to a separate building on TB. Simatupang street in South Jakarta. =al-Maktab al-Daimi= Ali bin Ja‚Äôfar bin Syech Al-Seggaf al-Maktab al-Daimi (; lit. Office of Records) is an autonomous official body of Rabithah al-Alawiyyah working to preserve lineage, consanguinity, history and census data of Alawiyyin. The establishment of this institution in 1954 was during the leadership of Alwi bin Thahir al-Haddad, not long after the establishment of Rabithah al-Alawiyyah and after it had earned the unanimous agreement from the Alawiyyin figures, elders, and scholars, such Habib Alwi bin Thahir al-Haddad (Mufti of Johor), Habib Ahmad bin Abdullah al-Seggaf (author of the pedigree book Khidmah al-Asyirah) and Habib Ali bin Abdurrahman al-Habshi of Kwitang. To perform this task, the forum appointed a son of wulayti, Sayyid Ali bin Ja'far bin Syeikh al-Seggaf (born in Palembang, 16 November 16, 1889 CE or 22 Rabi‚Äô al-awwal 1307 AH), who was also on the Supervisory Board at Rabithah Alawiyyah in Batavia. With the fund of Rabithah Alawiyah and from a philanthropist named Sheikh bin Ahmad bin Shahab, he censused and recorded Sayyid families throughout Indonesia in 1928 and 1940 (another version says in 1932). Per January 28, 1940 CE (18 Dzulhijjah 1358 AH) there was 17764 people counted as the members of Sayyid families. Ali bin Ja'far was then later elected as the first chairman and Hasyim bin Muhammad al-Hadi bin Ahmad al-Habshi as the deputy chairman, with Alwi bin Thahir al-Haddad and Ahmad bin Abdullah al-Shofie al-Seggaf as their advisors. Today this body records genealogical notes not only for alawiyyin people of Indonesia, but also from abroad. For references, the al-Maktab Daimi use books such as al-Shamsu al-Dzahirah by Habib Abdurrahman bin Mohammed al- Mashhoor, seven volume of the original handwritten books of Salman bin Said bin Awad Ba-Ghauts, three volumes of handwritten book Sajarah Ansaab Al- Alawiyyin (ÿ¥ÿ¨ÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿßŸÜÿ≥ÿßÿ® ÿßŸÑÿπŸÑŸàŸäŸÜ ) by Habib Ali bin Ja'far al-Seggaf, the book about Alawiyyin census report in Indonesia, and 15 volumes of The Ledger of Alawiyyin lineage books written by Habib Abdullah bin Isa ibn Hud al-Habshi which is an expansion of and is based on the three-volumes book of Ali bin Ja'far al-Seggaf, all of them are authentic, and only owned by al-Maktab al- Daimi. = Jamiat Kheir School = See Jamiat Kheir.

Background =Early Fox Sports golf involvement= Fox Sports partnered with Greg Norman in the early 1990s to create a world golf tour, which would have consisted of six events televised on Fox. However, PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem threatened to suspend any player participating in the events, and as a result created the World Golf Championships events, which were televised by CBS and ABC. Fox Sports bid for a portion of the PGA Tour's television rights starting in 1999. Although it did not gain the broadcast package (which was divided among the Big Three networks), Fox's regional sports networks group Fox Sports Networks reached an agreement with cable rightsholder Golf Channel to simulcast its early-round coverage, as the network was not widely-carried at the time. These simulcasts ended after 2001 under a deal which split the PGA Tour's cable rights between ESPN and USA Network. =Recent involvement and USGA rights= In 2011, Fox Sports gained the rights to the CVS Caremark Charity Classic, which is an unofficial money event on the PGA Tour, and had been previously televised by Golf Channel. The coverage aired on Fox Sports Net, with Kraig Kann hosting. Fox did not renew its rights for 2012. On August 6, 2013, Fox Sports announced a 12-year deal to broadcast the three open championships of the USGA: the U.S. Open, Women's Open, and Senior Open, beginning in 2015. Fox succeeded the USGA's long-term relationships with NBC Sports and ESPN. Fox, which has televised just one PGA Tour sanctioned event in its history (the unofficial CVS Charity Classic in 2011), paid $1 billion for full rights to all USGA championships. The Fox network airs the final two days of the U.S. Open, Women's Open, Senior Open, and Amateur, as well as late coverage of the first two days of the U.S. Open. The rest of the coverage airs on Fox Sports 1. Also, the final two days of the U.S. Open air on Spanish-language channel Fox Deportes.http://www.usga.org/articles/2015/02/fox-sports- announces-2015-usga-championship-broadcast-schedule-21474878643.html - 4 February 2015 NBC's lead analyst Johnny Miller expressed disappointment at the loss, saying that he \\"had a feeling\\" NBC would not retain rights, and that Fox would not be able to \\"fall out of a tree and do the U.S. Open.\\" NBC held the USGA rights for the previous two decades, from 1995 through 2014. Lead-up to Fox's first U.S. Open Fox used several telecasts to prepare for airing its first U.S. Open in 2015. These broadcasts familiarized Fox's talent and production staff with broadcasting golf. First, Fox was given credentials for studio wraparound programming live from the 2014 U.S. Open. This was allowed to compete with ESPN and NBC's studio programming. Newly named Fox golf hosts Joe Buck and Greg Norman hosted the programming. Fox worked an unofficial PGA Tour event in the fall of 2014 at the Franklin Templeton Shootout in Florida, with Buck and Norman hosting. This was the first time that the full Fox golf team did a telecast together. The final preparation for the Fox team came in May 2015 at the U.S. Amateur Four-Ball at Olympic Club in San Francisco. Buck and Norman again hosted alongside the full Fox golf team. U.S. Open coverage In June 2015, the Fox family covered the U.S. Open for the first time, from Chambers Bay in University Place, Washington, southwest of Tacoma. Fox Sports 1 aired preview programming hosted by Holly Sonders on the Tuesday and Wednesday prior to the championship. The 2015 edition of the U.S. Open had a total of 38.5 hours of coverage in the United States, with 22 hours being on Thursday and Friday, and 16.5 hours being on Saturday and Sunday; the Fox Sports 1 cable network had a total of 16 hours of coverage on Thursday and Friday. The Fox broadcast network had a total of 22.5 hours of coverage Thursday through Sunday, with six hours Thursday and Friday, and 16.5 hours Saturday and Sunday. Fox utilized a number of new technologies during its production, including drone flyovers, a camera-equipped RC car for ground perspectives, and new graphics‚Äîincluding a live shot tracer, an augmented reality display of green contours, and a persistent top-5 leaderboard displayed in the bottom-right of the screen. Fox again covered the Franklin Templeton Shootout in 2015. Norman's performance continued to come under criticism, and he was fired afterward. Paul Azinger, out of a job after 11 years working with Mike Tirico at ESPN/ABC, replaced Norman in 2016. = End of coverage = On June 29, 2020, it was confirmed that NBCUniversal had taken over the remainder of the contract. It was reported that Fox had been struggling with available broadcast slots and had sought to switch coverage of the 2020 U.S. Open, postponed to September due to the COVID-19 pandemic, to the FS1 cable network, which the USGA were not happy with.  Theme music  Fox did not carry over \\"In Celebration of Man\\", the Yanni-composed music that had been used by NBC for its U.S. Open coverage, choosing to commission film composer Brian Tyler to compose new music (after acquiring rights to The Open Championship beginning in 2016, NBC instated an updated version of \\"In Celebration of Man\\" as its theme music for the tournament). Tyler explained that his composition was intended to \\"capture the epic struggle, the challenge, the history, the heartbreak, and the elation of competitive golf,\\" and acknowledged that \\"Sports and music have always had an important connection for me. I love the way iconic sports themes evoke the spirit of sporting events and can provide dramatic impact and nostalgic memory.\\" Commentators On April 23, 2014, Fox Sports announced that Greg Norman would join Joe Buck as its lead golf commentary team. Buck and Norman worked together for the first time at the 2014 U.S. Open, where Fox produced studio programming that aired against ESPN and NBC's studio shows. =2015 U.S. Open= http://www.foxsports.com/presspass/latest-news/2015/06/11/fox-sports- tees-up-complete-broadcast-schedule-for-115th-u-s-open On November 18, 2014, in advance of its coverage of the Franklin Templeton Shootout, Fox announced the full layout of its golf team.http://www.foxsports.com/presspass/latest- news/2015/04/21/fox-sports-completes-usga-on-air-roster *Booth announcers: Joe Buck, Greg Norman *Tower announcers: Brad Faxon, Corey Pavin, Tom Weiskopf *On-course reporters: Juli Inkster, Steve Flesch, Scott McCarron, Charles Davis, Jay Delsing *Rules analyst: David Fay *Course design analyst: Gil Hanse *Studio Host: Curt Menefee *Interviews: Holly Sonders *Essays: Shane O'Donoghue *Featured Group: Tim Brando, Mark Brooks, Natalie Gulbis, Buddy Marucci *U.S. Open 360: Joel Klatt, Joe Ogilvie, Morgan Pressel, EA Tischler =2016 U.S. Open= http://www.foxsports.com/presspass/latest- news/2016/06/08/fox-sports-tees-up-complete-broadcast-schedule-for-116th-u-s- open-championship In January 2016, Greg Norman was let go by Fox in response to poor reception towards his performance during the U.S. Open, and was replaced by former ESPN analyst Paul Azinger.

At its peak it had 180-miles of track from Pasadena, through Downtown Los Angeles, the Westside, and Santa Monica, then to the South Bay towns along Santa Monica Bay. History The Los Angeles Pacific Railroad was established in 1899 by 'General' Moses Sherman and Eli P. Clark. Clark served as President of the company. The rapid interurban transit of the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad brought many new developments and residents to the Los Angeles region, along with the larger Pacific Electric Red Cars (PE) system that reached across the Greater Los Angeles. On June 16, 1903, the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad merged with the Los Angeles-Santa Monica Railroad Company and the Los Angeles, Hermosa Beach and Redondo Railway Company. The new name after this merger was the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad of California, but everyone still just called it the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad. The Los Angeles-Santa Monica Railroad Company was incorporated on December 2, 1902.Electric Railway Historical Association of Southern California, Los Angeles Pacific Corporate Histories erha.org, Electric Railway Historical Association of Southern California, Los Angeles Pacific On March 19, 1906, an agreement was reached to sell all the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad lines for $6 million to the Pacific Electric Railway, owned by Henry E.

Lines Los Angeles Pacific Railroad passenger cars operated in the cities of Los Angeles, Pasadena, Hollywood, Sawtelle, Santa Monica, and Ocean Park. Long Wharf in Santa Monica Bay 1895 Freight would be moved on the same lines but between midnight and morning. Regular freight consisted of oil from the Sherman Oil District west of Hollywood, and lumber from the Long Wharf in Santa Monica. Sherman also bought parcels of land west of Downtown Los Angeles, out to the ocean, and down the coast to present-day Redondo Beach. In 1906 the company owned and operated 405 cars: 144 passenger cars, 6 parlor cars, 17 electric locomotives, 221 freight cars, 5 mail cars and 12 repair service cars. 1920 Sherman Way in downtown Owensmouth, with Los Angeles Pacific Railroad lines Los Angeles Pacific Railroad Steam locomotive line ran from Los Angeles to Santa Monica, with stops in Hollywood and Colegrove.

A 1922 view of Cahuenga Pass and the rail lines installed by the Los Angeles Pacific On December 15, 1899, a line was started down Prospect Avenue from downtown Los Angeles to Hollywood. Prospect Avenue would be renamed Hollywood Blvd in 1910. Prospect Avenue was built in 1887. When Brentwood Park was being built the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad built tracks for the Westgate Line of Red Car service in 1906. This electric trolley ran from San Vicente Boulevard to Ocean Avenue (Santa Monica) and then turned south to the Santa Monica Main Line. The Santa Monica Short Line (Venice Blvd, San Vicente Blvd, Santa Monica Blvd) and the Venice Short Line (Venice Blvd, Trolley Way, Ocean) took away much of the Southern Pacific and Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway passenger business.

Sherman Way is named after General Sherman, due his land development and rail lines he built in the valley. For the lines out to the San Fernando Valley from Hollywood he built two tracks lines over the Cahuenga Pass and up Vineland Avenue through North Hollywood, turning onto Chandler Boulevard, proceeding west to the curve onto Van Nuys Boulevard, through Van Nuys to a curve (Sherman Circle) off of Van Nuys Boulevard, then turning west onto Sherman Way to Owensmouth, (present day Canoga Park). =Balloon Route = Los Angeles Pacific - Balloon Route map, 1905 Los Angeles Pacific - Balloon Route car, 1905 The Balloon Route Trolley trip was a featured route of the Los Angeles Pacific,http://www.wehoville.com/2015/10/01/riding-a-streetcar-named- nostalgia-through-west-hollywood-and-beyond/https://www.kcet.org/shows/lost- la/the-balloon-route-a-tourists-trolley-trip-through-early-1900s-los-angeles and opened in September, 1901. The line ran from downtown Los Angeles through Hollywood, Santa Monica, Venice Beach, Redondo Beach and back to Los Angeles via Palms. The lines stopped at beach resorts and included free entrance to some en-route stops and attractions along the way. Stops included: the Sunset Boulevard studio of painter Paul de Longpr√©, the bean fields of Morocco in Beverly Hills, Old Soldiers' Home in Sawtelle, Long Wharf, Camera Obscura at Santa Monica, Playa del Rey Pavilion for a fish dinner, Redondo's Moonstone Beach, Venice, and Palms. The streetcar departed downtown Los Angeles at 9:30 am each day and returned to Los Angeles at 5:00 pm for the cost of $1.00. This excursion line was heavily advertised and thus became well known. The first car used was a Parlor car (#400), and as the line became popular more cars were added. The owner of Hollywood's first Hotel, the Glen-Holly Hotel, operated the line for the LAP.

He received a 50-year franchise from the city and sold stock to help build his street car railroad. In January, 1891 Sherman made his brother-in-law, Eli P. Clark, vice-president and manager of the Los Angeles Consolidated Electric Railway, the predecessor of the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad. The company built 47 miles of track radiating out around from Arcade Depot at 6th and Central Streets in downtown Los Angeles. The new company did well. The power for the street cars came from two Thompson-Corliss type oil steam engines, each with 700 horsepower, made by Golden State Miners‚Äô Iron Works in San Francisco. Joseph W. Wolfskill sold a lot to the Los Angeles Consolidated Electric Railway for the Arcade Depot.erha.org Los Angeles Consolidated Electric Railway, started in 1890, California Illustrated, 1892 In 1899 the Los Angeles Consolidated Electric Railway became part of the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad, as steam trains and other rail lines were added to the system.

Pasadena and Los Angeles Electric Railway Co. was incorporated by Sherman and Clark in April 1894. It then purchased all the rail lines running in Pasadena including City Railway Company of Pasadena and the Pasadena Street Railroad. On May 6, 1895 the line from downtown Los Angeles (Fourth and Spring streets) to Pasadena opened, running through the Arroyo Seco and South Pasadena. One of the popular stops on the line was the Cawston Ostrich Farm. The Pasadena to Downtown LA line was the first interurban line, \\"between cities\\".Pacific Electric Red Cars, By Jim Walker, page 10erha.org South Pasadena Local Lines The company also ran the Arroyo Seco Line 1.7 mile, that connected to the Southern Pacific RR at Broadway & Colorado. The Columbia Street Line ran from Raymond Hotel (South Fair Oaks) and the Santa Fe's South Pasadena Station. Clark had served has a director on the board and as a trustee. The line had 44 miles of tracks at it peak. Many of the horse-pulled cars were changed to electric. In May, 1895 a South Pasadena stop was added. In 1898 the company changed to the Los Angeles and Pasadena Electric Railway Company as Sherman & Clark lost control of the company to a Chicago Company.erha.org Pasadena & Los Angeles Electric Railway - Los Angeles & Pasadena Electric Railway The complete system was sold on March 10, 1902 to the Southern Pacific Company.Ohio State Press, Trolleys, Real Estate, and Electric Power, 1898-1903, Ch. 4 Los Angeles Herald, Volume 26, Number 237, 25 May 1897 1900: Pacific Electric Railway Pasadena and Pacific car labelled \\"Santa Monica,‚Äù 1908 Raymond and Fair Oaks Pasadena, with the Street Car Rail on both streets, with Pasadena National Bank building. *West Pasadena Railway Company West Pasadena Railway Company made the West Colorado & Orange Grove Avenue Line in 1891, this started as horse pulled car.

She is a well-known member of the Gambian community in the U.S. and runs the popular news and politics website Maafanta.com. She was the first female reporter at the Gambian Daily Observer and is widely known as ‚ÄúGambia's Iron Lady‚Äù and the ‚ÄúDame of the Flaming Pen.‚Äù During a visit to her native country in 2007, Jaw-Manneh was arrested and tried for sedition. Her arrest and trial were widely covered by international human rights groups and were protested by the Committee to Protect Journalists and by PEN in the UK and the U.S. Early life and education Fatou Jaw-Manneh was born in Sukuta/Foni Bulock, Gambia. She has recalled that as a young woman she ‚Äúsat contemplating, with [her] brother and his friends\\"...how they were \\"going to get a job‚Äù in a country ‚Äúrife with nepotism, corruption, and serious government irresponsibility.‚Äù Her brother, she said, taught her ‚Äúhow to brew tea/attaya, play Scrabble, listen to all kinds of music; mostly Bob Marley, Burning Spear, Peter Tosh and all the heavyweight reggae kings‚Ä¶.Plus he introduced me to reading political materials and holding arguments, taking and receiving blows.‚Äù She has said that her first job after high school was ‚Äúa receptionist/phone operator at the Novotel/Kombo beach Hotel.‚Äù When she was laid off during after tourist season, a friend of her father's ‚Äúgave [her] a job at his tiny juice shop,‚Äù where she ‚Äúsold soft drinks and rented out action movies.‚Äù At the time she was ‚Äúa young married mother with two sons,‚Äù whose husband was ‚Äúon a hustle in America,‚Äù seeking help to ‚Äúget into law school.‚Äù Introduction to journalism During this time, she was always enticed by the current events of her native country and the globe. ‚ÄúI would always buy the Observer, this new paper...‚Äù she explained. She would read avidly about the Mandelas, and about ‚ÄúLady Diana and Whitney Houston.‚Äù She liked the Observer because it ran ‚Äúphotos of our politicians,‚Äù thus providing ‚Äúevidence of all our fears of and distaste for Gambian politicians,‚Äù and also ‚Äúcarried human-interest stories‚Äù and ‚Äúrepresented the downtrodden.‚Äù Jaw-Manneh ‚Äúbegan bombarding the Observer with letters to the editor about government waste, nepotism, cheating [the people] on government scholarships, and the dangers of skin bleaching. And about corruption and everything else that was bothering our communities.‚Äù Career at The Observer Eventually, she went to the newspaper's offices and met the letters editor, who was the sister of Kenneth Y. Best, the Liberian exile who was the newspaper's publisher. Brewer ‚Äúlaughed at the sheer bulk of letters to the editor [Jaw-Manneh] was sending by the day‚Äù and introduced her to Best, who asked if she wanted to be a reporter. She reportedly replied ‚ÄúOh no Sir, I am not that educated... and I know nothing about reporting.‚Äù He then offered her first a position as a columnist, but after she considered the proposals decided on being a reporter. She became the newspaper's first female reporter. As she ‚Äúbecame more of an opinionated commentator,‚Äù says Jaw-Manneh, Best would ‚Äúpluck and peel my opinions out of news stories,‚Äù saying ‚ÄúI am not asking for your opinion. Give me the story, the Who, What and Why.‚Äù Exile Jaw-Manneh was granted political asylum in the U.S. in 1994 after the coup that brought President Yahya Jammeh to power. After her emigration from Gambia, she was a frequent contributor to the now-defunct U.S.-based opposition website AllGambian.net. In 2003 she wrote an article, entitled ‚ÄúJammeh under the Microscope,‚Äù for the Gambian newspaper The Independent, which is also now-defunct. The article, which focused on that country's poverty level and corruption, resulted in the arrest and detention of the paper's editor, Abdoulie Sey. The Gambian government shut down The Independent in 2006. Writing on her website Maafanta.com, Jaw-Manneh has argued that ‚Äúno other sector in Gambian civil society has suffered as much as the private press under President Yahya Jammeh.‚Äù Although he had originally ‚Äúpresented himself as a different kind of...leader, one who respects and believes in a free and vibrant press,‚Äù he had eventually turned the press into his ‚Äúpunching bag,‚Äù as a result of which ‚Äúmost journalists have been forced to go into exile or to abandon the profession due to family pressure, while a number of newspapers and radio stations have been indefinitely closed by the government.‚Äù Arrest and trial In March 2007, Jaw-Manneh traveled from the U.S. to Gambia, where her father had recently died. She was arrested upon arrival at Banjul Airport on March 28, 2007, by agents of the National Intelligence Agency and charged with sedition, in part for an interview she had given to the Independent newspaper in 2004. The interview, which had first appeared in June 2004, had been posted in October 2005 on several websites, including AllGambian.net. In the interview, she had stated: ‚ÄúJammeh is tearing our beloved country into shreds, he debunked our hopes and became a thorn into every issue that is related to progress in The Gambia; be it social, political and economical. Worst of all he is a bundle of terror.‚Äù Asked if the arrest had come as a shock, Jaw-Manneh said she had been ‚Äúcaught off guard‚Ä¶but not shocked, given the hostility towards journalists in the country.‚Äù Joel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), complained that Manneh's ‚Äúweek-long detention without charge violated her basic due process rights under Gambian laws.‚Äù CPJ called on Gambian authorities to drop the charges against Manneh. On 4 April, Jaw-Manneh appeared before a court in Kanifing and was charged on three counts: ‚ÄúIntention to commit sedition,‚Äù ‚Äúpublication of seditious words,‚Äù and ‚Äúpublication of false news intended to cause public fear and alarm to the Gambian public.‚Äù A fourth charge, ‚Äúuttering seditious words,‚Äù was added on 20 June 2007. Each of the counts carried a prison term of two years, a fine, or both. She was released on 25,000 dalasis (US$950) bail, but ordered to surrender her travel documents. The trial was set for 11 April 2007. Jaw-Manneh's lawyer argued that the court lacked jurisdiction, because the alleged offenses had been committed when Jaw-Manneh was outside the country, but the court rejected this argument. English PEN protested her trial, calling the charges ‚Äúa violation of her right to freedom of expression guaranteed by the Gambian Constitution and international human rights treaties.‚Äù Jaw-Manneh's incarceration and trial were ‚Äúa very difficult time for [her],‚Äù she stated. ‚ÄúIt is not easy when all of a sudden, you are restricted to an unhealthy facility. The emotional and mental torture was tough. I had to sleep in a mosquito infested room. I was red like a tomato from all the mosquito bites. No sleep. Thank God I did not fall sick after six days of detention.‚Äù During the trial itself, she recalled, ‚Äú[so] much has changed after this military takeover. You see judges just being pawns and dictated to. So they choose to side with the dictator, and send citizens to jail for all kinds of libel and seditious charges.‚Äù Jaw-Manneh's trial for sedition lasted a year and a half. She was sentenced to a fine of D250,000 (about $11,000) or four years in jail with hard labor. PEN American Center sent a letter to President Jammeh on September 10, 2008, to protest Jaw- Manneh's sentence and call for an acquittal, which was ignored. She chose to pay the fine, which she was able to pay with the help of friends, family, and the Gambian Press Union. Return to U.S. After her return to the U.S., Jaw- Manneh continued criticizing Jammeh, describing him as ‚Äúmore dangerous, more corrupt than ever‚Äù and as ‚Äúone of the richest and most corrupt leaders in Africa, who is ‚Äúselling everything in Gambia, from bananas to bread to meat,‚Äù and trafficking in drugs and arms. She has claimed that ‚ÄúGambians are being detained, jailed and killed at random,‚Äù and has also charged that ‚ÄúGambians have never seen such a leader and hope he is the last of his kind in the country.‚Äù In her article ‚ÄúPlea to the Gambian Intellectual‚Äù, written in August 2012, she wrote: ‚ÄúGambia has been highjacked by an individual who is not qualified to lead our country‚Äù and who ‚Äúhas brought death, destruction, fear‚Äù to the country, which is ‚Äúyearning for some of us to rise up‚Äù and save it ‚Äúfrom the clutches of tyranny.‚Äù She called on ‚Äúa selected few,‚Äù whom she dubbed 'The Redemption Gambia Group', ‚Äúto come up with a plan that will ultimately rescue our country for sliding into the abyss.‚Äù Her favorite story, she noted, was ‚Äúof the American Founding Fathers. Can you imagine then the power of the British Empire? 50 Americans choose to sign the [D]eclaration of Independence document, and shoot it out to the king,‚Äù thereby signing off ‚Äútheir right to live then, to liberty and to everything they own. Signing that document then was a death sentence.‚Äù As a result, many ‚Äúfamilies were torn,‚Äù but today not only are American citizens ‚Äúbenefiting from the actions and thoughtfulness of those brave men who came to their rescue 200 years ago, but every citizen of the world aspire[s] to come here to the USA for education, or to know that you can work the restaurant kitchens [and] get paid 250 dollars a week, take care of your family and live freely.‚Äù In September 2012, Jaw-Manneh took part in a protest by Gambian and Senegalese citizens outside the State Capitol in St. Paul, Minnesota, against Jammeh's execution of nine death-row inmates. ‚ÄúThe man is too brutal,‚Äù said Jaw-Manneh. ‚ÄúWe are not animals‚Ä¶ Jammeh should not decide who should live, die, eat or travel. It is unfair.‚Äù In a videotaped interview, she said: ‚ÄúWe have an animal as a president. He‚Äôs a cannibal, he‚Äôs a thief‚Ä¶he‚Äôs a very, very wicked human being‚Ä¶.We have to show him we are not afraid of him. It has to stop, this human sacrifice, this killing Gambians every day. It has to stop.‚Äù In November 2013, Jaw-Manneh wrote a 75th birthday tribute to Best, whom she thanked for having hired her and others who had ‚Äúno family or government connections.‚Äù When Gambia passed a restrictive new press law in 2013, Jaw-Manneh wrote on Facebook: ‚ÄúSenseless and Ruthless! We are not threatened and shall never back down!!!‚Äù She spoke at the Oslo Freedom Forum in May 2014. Honors and awards She won Oxfam Novib/PEN International Free Expression Award in 2007. It is presented ‚Äúto writers who continue to work for freedom of expression in the face of persecution.‚Äù She won the Hellman/Hammett award from Human Rights Watch in 2009. The award aims ‚Äúto help writers who dare to express ideas that criticize official public policy or people in power.‚Äù References Category:Living people Category:Gambian journalists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Fatou Jaw-Manneh"},{"id":"43076403","text":"Aramos ramosa is a moth in the family Cossidae.

With the government giving its sanction in 1898, work began in fully. The line was opened to traffic in 1900\\\\. This railway line was built at a cost of Rs 700,000. In the starting years, the Parlakhemundi Railway had incurred losses but after 1910, it started making marginal profits and after 1924-25, the profits increased. This motivated the Raja to extend the line to Gunupur in two phases in 1929 and 1931. It was later merged with Bengal Nagpur Railway. Railway reorganization After Indian Independence it was merged with South Eastern Railway. surveys were undertaken for broad gauge conversion in 1950 and again in 1964 and 1967.

Early life Fleetwood was the eldest son of Arthur Fleetwood of Lichfield, Staffordshire and St Margaret's, Westminster, and his wife Mary Archbold, daughter of Sir Henry Archbold of Abbots Bromley, Staffordshire, chancellor of Lichfield diocese. His father was secretary to the Earl of Danby. He was a cousin of Sir Christopher Musgrave, 5th Baronet. He matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford on 25 October 1683, aged 16, but in 1685 he joined the English Army. He was an Ensign in the 7th Foot, and rose to second lieutenant in 1687, and lieutenant in 1688. In 1704 he inherited estates, including Penwortham Priory, from his cousin Edward Fleetwood MP. Career Fleetwood stood unsuccessfully for Preston at a by election on 27 December 1706. He was returned unopposed as Tory Member of Parliament for Preston at the 1708 British general election. He voted against the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. At the 1710 British general election, he was returned unopposed again as a Tory at Preston with the support of the Duke and Duchess of Hamilton. He was a teller on the Tory side, and was listed as one of the ‚ÄòTory patriots‚Äô who opposed to the war and a ‚Äòworthy patriot‚Äô who detected the mismanagements of the previous administration. He voted for the French commerce bill on 18 June 1713. After assiduously canvassing his electorate, he was returned at the head of the poll for Preston in a contest at the 1713 British general election but made little impression in Parliament.

The population of the community is about 14,000 as of 2012. History The first Vietnamese migrants to Belgium consisted of students and diplomats from South Vietnam beginning in 1965, when the South Vietnamese government sought for stronger relations with other Francophone nations following a minor rift with France. Belgium soon became a popular alternative to France for South Vietnamese students seeking higher education and career opportunities, especially in the cities of Brussels, Li√®ge and Leuven. A much larger influx of Vietnamese immigrants arrived as refugees following the Fall of Saigon, beginning in 1978. Similarly to their counterparts in France, South Vietnamese refugees to Belgium were largely of higher socioeconomic standing and integrated much easier into their host country's society due to better linguistic and cultural knowledge than their peers who settled in North America, Australia and the rest of Europe.La Diaspora Vietnamienne en France un cas particulier (in French) Following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, a number of Vietnamese workers in former Soviet Bloc countries who were sponsored by the communist government of Vietnam sought asylum in Belgium. This included many guest workers in the former East Germany who were encouraged by the German government to be repatriated back to their home country following German reunification. Demographics and Culture A large proportion of the Vietnamese Belgian population resides in Brussels and the surrounding area, with a Vietnamese business district centered along Boulevard Anspach. The rest of the Vietnamese Belgian community is largely concentrated in the southern French-speaking Wallonia region, especially around the city of Li√®ge. The Vietnamese community in Belgium maintains strong relations with its counterpart community in France. Before the establishment of Vietnamese businesses and community institutions in Belgium during the late 1970s, Vietnamese Belgians would travel to Paris for various purposes, such as buying Vietnamese grocery products and seeking immigrant needs. In terms of religion, the vast majority of Vietnamese Belgians are at least nominal Buddhists, following the Mahayana branch with influences from Confucian philosophy. The influx of Vietnamese immigrants into Belgium created a visible Buddhist community in the country, with temples serving as both spiritual and community centers, and have also attracted non-Vietnamese worshippers.Bernard De Backer, Bouddhismes en Belgique from Courrier hebdomadaire, n¬∞1768-1769, Centre de recherche et d'information socio-politiques, Bruxelles, 2002, pp. 5-70 Socioeconomics The Vietnamese community in Belgium is largely well- integrated into Belgian society. Among immigrants from the former South Vietnam, initial strong knowledge of the French language allowed them to pursue studies and careers despite their recent arrival. While some Vietnamese immigrants did settle in the Flanders region and learned Dutch, most relocated to Brussels or Wallonia. Meanwhile, Belgian-born Vietnamese have extremely high rates of success in education, at many times outperforming their peers and having a high rate of enrollment in higher education.

Between December 2007 and August 2017, she served as the Prosecutor General of Venezuela. A proponent of the Chavismo ideology, Ortega D√≠az was fired as Prosecutor General on 5 August 2017 by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice and the Constituent National Assembly (ANC) promoted by Nicol√°s Maduro, following a breaking with the Maduro government as a result of the 2017 Venezuelan constitutional crisis in the context of the crisis in Venezuela. This dismissal was rejected by the opposition-led National Assembly of Venezuela, arguing that only that institution had the power to carry out said removal according to the Constitution, and cataloging the Prosecutor as the only legitimate authority of the Public Ministry. As a result, she is called by the National Assembly, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Venezuela in exile and some media outlets as the Prosecutor General of Venezuela in exile. Early life and career Ortega D√≠az was born in Valle de la Pascua, in Gu√°rico State, on 11 January 1958. She was educated at the University of Carabobo, in Carabobo, graduating in law. She then chose to specialize in criminal law and in procedural law and moved to Caracas. She studied criminal law at the Universidad Santa Mar√≠a and procedural law at Andr√©s Bello Catholic University, both in the capital. Ortega later became a law professor at the Universidad Santa Mar√≠a and still holds the title. She also served as a legal consultant to the state TV channel, Venezolana de Televisi√≥n. Prosecutor General In April 2002, Ortega joined the public prosecution service, in the Ministerio P√∫blico. On 13 December 2007, she was appointed Prosecutor General under President Hugo Ch√°vez, the office often being translated by its equivalent of Attorney General. She was appointed by the Chavismo-controlled parliament, or National Assembly, for a six-year period from 2008. In December 2014, on completion of the 2008‚Äì14 term, she received authorization for a second term, from 2015‚Äì21. She was head of the Prosecutor General under Nicol√°s Maduro when arrest warrants and indictments were issued against opposition leader Leopoldo L√≥pez. Later on, Ortega stated that she was pressured in bringing about trumped up charges against L√≥pez. Ortega denounced the rupture of democracy in Venezuela when the Venezuelan Supreme Court, in a move broadly, both nationally and internationally, considered a power grab, assumed powers constitutionally attributed to the National Assembly. The move was seen as a betrayal by the Maduro government and resulted in subsequent accusations by the Maduro government and the Venezuelan Supreme Court. On 29 June 2017, the Supreme Court barred her from leaving the country and froze her assets, due to alleged \\"serious misconduct\\" in office. She was dismissed as Prosecutor General by the newly established National Constituent Assembly on 5 August 2017. Later life Tarek William Saab, the replacement Chief Prosecutor appointed by the Constituent Assembly, made a statement on 16 August 2017 that former Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega D√≠az and her husband, German Ferrer, operated an extortion group and a day later, the Constituent Assembly ordered for their arrest with the couple fleeing to Colombia. Ferrer has responded to the allegations by saying the charges are political in nature. Ortega and Ferrer fled from Venezuela by speedboat to Aruba and flew into Colombia, with Ortega stating that the Maduro government would \\"deprive me of my life\\". Maduro has said he is seeking an international arrest warrant both her and her husband declaring they had been involved in serious crimes.

Education and career Van den Berg was born in Haarlem, Noord-Holland, the Netherlands on October 19, 1845. His father is Simon van den Berg and his mother is Sophie Charlotte Immerzeel. He married to Fran√ßoise Steup in 1884. After completing the Gymnasium (Lyc√©e or secondary school), he studied at Taal-, Land- end Volkenkunde in Leiden University, graduating summa cum laude in 1868 with a dissertation on Muslim property law, De Contractu Do Ut Des. Soon afterwards, he left for the Indies where he held several clerical and judicial posts until, in 1878, he was given the prestigious, newly created, position of Official for the practice of \\"Indische\\" languages and Adviser for Eastern (Oostersche) languages and Muslim law. Van den Berg continued his exploration of Muslim law by publishing De Beginselen [Principles] van het Mohammedaansche Recht, Volgens de Im√¢m's Aboe Hanifat en Sj√¢fi‚Äòi (The Principles of the Mohammedan Law, according to the Imams Abu Hanifah and Shafi'i) in 1874. Second and third editions followed in 1878 and 1883. Van den Berg‚Äôs interest in the Arab communities of Java led him to complete an important work on this subject. His book on ranks and titles on Java and Madura should also be noted among several other contributions, but his book which has been most referenced and cited for topic of Indonesian Hadhrami is Le Hadhramout et les colonies arabes dans l'archipel Indien (\\"The Hadhramaut and Arab settlements in the Indian archipelago\\") Many times van den Berg had opposite opinions with another Dutch orientalist, Snouck Hurgronje. Van den Berg's first exchange with Snouck concerned Van den Berg's own paper publication on Imam al-Nawawi's Minh√¢dj at-talib√Æn (). Snouck stressed that including the original Arabic text was superfluous as excellent copies were available throughout the Muslim world. While complimenting Van den Berg on the smoothness of the French text, Snouck also questioned whether the various terms found in the Fiqh books should be translated because the Arabic words were critical technical terms, ‚Äúthe pillars‚Äù of knowledge and wisdom. In July 1881, Van den Berg wrote a critique of the Holle's recommendations which called for strict monitoring Islam in the East Indies. In a matter of putting spies in Mecca, for example, according to Van den Berg, it is completely useless because most Arabs residing in Nusantara were from Hadhramaut. Hadhramis were considered strangers in the eyes of the Arabs of Mecca. A state commission was established in 1890 for revision of colonial legislation in the field of private law and van den Berg was appointed as its secretary. A decade later, Snouck used another opportunity to critique Van den Berg. In this case, it concerned Aceh. In 1880, Th. Der Kinderen, a member of the Council of the Indies, and Van den Berg as his secretary had been instructed to visit Aceh and report on its ‚Äúunruly‚Äù conditions. With the Aceh problem continuing to be unresolved, Snouck (who had arrived in Java in 1889 to become Advisor for Native Affairs) was sent to Aceh in 1891. His seven-month stay in that part of Aceh under Dutch military control resulted in a lengthy report and the publication of a two-volume De Atj√®hers. Even though Snouck criticized him many times, Van den Berg‚Äôs career does not seem to have been affected negatively. Van den Berg became a corresponding member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1876 and resigned in 1888. Van den Berg returned to the Netherlands in 1887 to accept a Professorship at the Indische Instelling Delft, a college for colonial administration. His tenure at the institute moved along smoothly while he continued to publish. In his later life, he also was active in politics for the Anti-Revolutionary Party, serving on the municipal council of Delft from 1901 to 1904 and as mayor of the same town between 1910 and 1920. He was member of the States of South Holland from 1902 to 1911 and a member of the Dutch parliament's First Chamber between 1911 and 1923. Van den Berg died on March 2, 1927, in Delft, South Holland, Netherlands. Although the name of L.W.C. van den Berg is not as famous as his successor, Snouck Hurgronje, on researches on Islam and Arabs in East Indies, but van den Berg still has been a very important orientalist.

It is an arbovirus and has been isolated from Culex, Anopheles, Armigeres,:fr:Armigeres and Aedes mosquitoes in Indonesia and China. Other members of the genus Seadornavirus have been linked to viral encephalitis. Characteristics The Kadipiro virus contains 12 segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) with a 21,000 base-pair genome. The capsid is icosahedral and naked, though it does temporarily acquire a viral envelope as it buds from a host cell. Sedoreovirinae viruses contain and inner, intermediate and outer capsid. The capsid is 70 nanometers in diameter with capsid spikes and 7 structural proteins. Taxonomy The Kadipiro virus was once classified as Coltivirus JKT-7075. It has been reclassified to the genus Seadornavirus of the subfamily Sedoreovirinae within the family Reoviridae. The Reoviridae have not been assigned to an order.http://ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp Due to the dsRNA nature of the viral genome, the virus is classified as a Group III virus under the Baltimore classification system. Since discovery of the Kadipiro virus several strains have been identified. JKT-7075 is now listed as one of those strains. The genus Seadornavirus contains Banna virus, Kadipiro virus, and Liao ning virus. All three viruses can typically be found where Japanese encephalitis virus and Dengue virus have been reported. Geography The Kadipiro virus was once thought to only exist in Indonesia, but has since been isolated also from mosquitoes in China. The range includes the tropics and subtropics. Virology The Kadipiro virus was isolated in three mosquito genera: Culex, Anopheles and Armigeres and was grown in laboratory cultures. It was later found in Aedes mosquitoes. It was observed that the virus grew readily in mice and insect cell cultures with cytopathic effects in C6/36 (Aedes albopictus cell line), but was limited to BSR (clones of BHK cells) mammalian cells. No major disease resulted from infection in mice and immunological memory against a subsequent viral challenge was observed.http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0037732 References Category:Seadornaviruses ","title":"Kadipiro virus"},{"id":"43076957","text":"Kiska is an island in the Rat Islands group of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska.

Satellite remote sensing of the atmosphere has the advantage of being able to provide global coverage of atmospheric planetary boundary layer properties while simultaneously providing relatively high temporal sampling rates. Advancements in satellite remote sensing have provided greater vertical resolution which enables higher accuracy for planetary boundary layer measurements. The radiative forcing for marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds is imperative for understanding any global warming changes. Low-level clouds, including MBL clouds, have the largest net radiative forcing of all clouds. The albedo of these low level clouds is much higher than the albedo of the underlying ocean surface and correctly modeling these clouds is needed to limit the uncertainty in climate model predictions. The remote sensing of the planetary boundary layer, especially clouds and aerosols within the planetary boundary layer can help verify and improve climate models. Planetary boundary layer The planetary boundary layer is the portion of the troposphere that is influenced by the interaction with the surface of the earth and will adjust to surface forcings within a timescale of 1 hour. The planetary boundary layer is characterized by turbulence during the daytime and by stability during the night. At the top of the planetary boundary layer, there is a stable layer that is frequently termed the inversion layer as temperature tends to increase with height in contrast to much of the troposphere. The planetary boundary layer can have lower level clouds located around the capping inversion top. The two main types of clouds within the planetary boundary layer are fair-weather cumulus clouds and stratocumulus clouds. The underlying surface primarily determines the type of cloud produced within the planetary boundary layer. The presence of the capping inversion can also trap aerosols within the planetary boundary layer. The increase of anthropogenic aerosols from burning fossil fuels can have significant impacts on precipitation and climate. Satellite Remote Sensing Satellite measurements have the advantage of being able to sample meteorological variables in regions that have little measurement systems. Many instruments have been created to help observe the atmosphere for both research and weather prediction. One of the first successful satellite missions for weather radar observations was the Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS). This instrument paved the way for more weather satellite systems that utilize the visible, infrared and microwave radiation spectrum. Current remote sensing instruments that can help detect planetary boundary layer phenomenon include the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard Terra and Aqua as well as CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) aboard CALIPSO. While MODIS and many other satellites are passive remote sensors, active remote sensors such as CALIPSO provide greater accuracy for height retrievals. Satellite measurements have been used to determine the dynamical conditions that produce planetary boundary layer clouds and the climatological regions of where these clouds occur. Planetary boundary layer clouds =Remote sensing of mesoscale cellular convection = Mesoscale cellular convection (MCC) is a form of buoyantly driven convection that can provide the planetary boundary layer with cumulus clouds at the top of the boundary layer. MCC generally occurs over ocean regions and is primarily found off the coasts of major continents particularly in North and South America. MCC is a form of the B√©nard cell where the fluid will rise or fall in hexagonal cells creating hexagonal cloud structure. The capping inversion of the planetary boundary layer acts as a lid for the convection creating a horizontal plane for the hexagonal cloud structures. Satellite observations have been imperative for understanding the horizontal scale and the vertical scale of these cloud formations. MCC is generally too small for synoptic scale measurements, but too large for single point measurements. However, satellite observations are able to monitor the development of the cloud patterns because of their large field of view. Satellites images from TIROS helped to highlight one of the main differences between laboratory convection cells and those that occur in the atmosphere. The ratio of the diameter of the hexagon compared to the depth of the cloud was much larger in the atmosphere compared to the same ratio calculated in controlled experiments. This difference showed that viscosity and heat conduction were important for the laboratory measurements, but eddy diffusion of heat and momentum dominated the atmospheric cells. Wind shear must be low to form MCC cells otherwise cloud streaks will form in the direction of the wind shear. The cloud formations that occur as part of MCC can be placed into two categories: open cells and closed cells. =Open cells= MODIS image of open cellular convection taken southeast of South Africa Open cells are characterized by a cloud free region in the middle of the hexagonal formation with cloudy regions in the outer edge of the hexagon. The open cell will have slow descending motion in the middle with faster rising motion on the edges forming the hexagonal cloud shape. They tend to form over colder water such as those that exist off the Californian coast. While places such as the Californian coast regularly produce open cellular convection, atmospheric storm systems can also spur the production of open cellular clouds in regions of low climatological production. Open cellular patterns can often be found behind cold fronts in the cold unstable air, and produce multiple cloud types including cumulus congenstus, cumulonimbus, and stratocumulus clouds. However, the open cells formed in subtropical regions are not normally associated with synoptic storms. =Closed cells= MODIS image of closed cellular convection taken southeast of South Africa Closed cells contain cloud filled regions in the center of the hexagon formation with cloud free regions on the edge of the hexagon. The closed cell has slow rising motion in the middle and faster descending motion at the edges. Closed cells tend to occur over warmer waters such as those associated with the Kuroshio Current and the Gulf Stream. Closed cellular patterns are generally formed under weak convective mixing in the lower levels with an inversion layer cap. They commonly occur in the eastern sections of subtropical high pressure regions or in the southeastern quadrant of polar highs. Aerosols from Satellites CALIPSO satellite image showing lidar backscatter and aerosol classification based on the backscatter data. The CALIOP on board CALIPSO allows for the measurements of different aerosol particles by measuring the backscatter at wavelengths of 1064 and 532 nanometers with the ability to receive two orthogonal components in the 532 nm wavelength. Without the presence of optically thick clouds, aerosol layers within the planetary boundary layer may be measured and provides a great technique for measuring aerosol pollution. Ground-based lidar have shown agreement with CALIOP in measuring isolated aerosol layers above the Seoul metropolitan area. CALIPSO has also been used in conjunction with the MODIS data to determine how aerosols within the planetary boundary layer might alter low planetary boundary layer stratus clouds. The detection of biomass burning aerosols were shown to decrease the cloud droplet radius within these warm layer clouds in agreement with the Albrecht effect, while simultaneously decreasing liquid water path in contrast to the Albrecht effect. Boundary layer height The boundary layer tends to have higher moisture values and greater aerosol amounts which results in higher scattering of light within the boundary layer. With remote sensing instruments, the boundary layer height can be detected based on these principles. Using the lidar on board CALIPSO, boundary layer height estimates have been made and compared with radiosonde and ECMWF re- analysis data and have shown high correlations between the remote sensing estimated value and the measured radiosonde values. The boundary layer height can be derived in a few different ways from lidar data including the maximum variance technique, which states that the maximum in the variance of the backscatter occurs at the top of the boundary layer. Within the entrainment zone, cleaner free troposphere eddies will mix with more polluted boundary layer eddies resulting in high variances at the height of the entrainment layer. The use of satellite derived boundary layer heights provides another method for verifying climate model output. Some remote sensing instruments have limitations. Since CALIOP relies on the use of backscattered light, daytime retrievals can contain high signal to noise ratios as sunlight can add background noise. Nighttime retrievals  Boundary layer composition  Under suitable conditions, specialized lidar techniques can be used to determine the boundary layer composition. Lidar pulses used for remote sensing get pulse echoes off the ground and off clouds. When there is a layer of broken clouds at the top of the boundary layer, IPDA lidar techniques used for atmospheric composition remote sensing can obtain the boundary layer composition.

It is the starting point for excursions to the summit of la Maladeta, of the monts Maudits and the Aneto (highest point in the Pyrenees). It lies in the commune of Benasque, north-east of Huesca province, Aragon (Spain).  History  1895 : the shepherd's hut The refuge's name comes from the Pic de la Rencluse above it. It was originally a shelter under rock, then a shepherd's hut, which was used as a shelter by Platon de Tchihatchev, Albert de Franqueville and guides Pierre Sanio, Jean Sors dit Argarot, Pierre Redonnet dit Nate et Bernard Arrazau dit Ursule, during their first ascension of the Aneto in July 1842. Later, engineer and Catalan pyreneist Juli Soler i Santal√≥ (1865-1914) made a small 4x3 house built, near its current location, which he named villa Maladeta, and he draughted the future refuge. The refuge was inaugurated in 1916. It had 22 beds and was kept by Antonio Abadias. It rapidly became one of the most frequented refuges in the Pyrenees. The Spanish civil war interrupted its activity, and it wasn't until 1951 that a new refuge, restored and enlarged, came to be. After Antonio Abadias' death, Benasquan Antonio Gari√© succeeded him in 1966.  Access and services  Renclusa refuge Today the refuge offers around 110 places and is one of the biggest in the Pyrenees. It is kept from end of June to end of September and is open weekends during the skiing period. It is managed by the Aragonese Mountain Federation (FAM) and the Excursionist Centre of Catalonia (CEC). One can get there from Benasque (about an hour's walk from Besurta car park) and from France, from Bagn√®res- de-Luchon, by the port de Venasque.

Description  The Kurabit is a long, slightly curved wooden shield. It is made of a lightweight wood and has a coconut central boss. Its straight upper side is rather broad. Looking down it, the shield becomes a little narrower and then somewhat broader until about halfway. From here it tapers towards a blunt tip. Just above the centre the grip is cut out of the shield. The subsequent holes are covered using half a coconut shell attached by means of rattan. A Kurabit is usually decorated with geometrical, coloured motifs on both sides. Spirals (patogalik) are much used. Moreover, decorations such as lizard and human figures in 'rock painting styles' are seen. To make red paint, the fruit of the kalumangan tree is used. The black paint consists of soot mixed with plant juices. Since the termination of head-hunting and of disputes between Mentawai ethnic groups at the beginning of the 20th century, the Kurabit has become very rare. The older examples seem to be less broad and less curved than more recent ones.

The organization was founded by King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden in 2009 in order to advance children‚Äôs rights in accordance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The focus of Global Child Forum is grounded in both the Convention on the Rights of a Child and UNICEF's Children‚Äôs Rights and Business Principles and is aimed towards giving business an understanding of how and where their business might impact children.  History  Global Child Forum was founded in 2009 as World Child and Youth Forum (WCYF). The name was then shorted to Global Child Forum in 2012. Initially, WCYF was intended to be an independent group of decision-makers with the goal of discussing children‚Äôs rights and business while using the Royal Palace as a venue. Since then, the organization has expanded to include Regional Forums and conduct its own independent research.  Forums  Global Child Forum is best known for its global and regional forums. Each Forum consists of speaker sessions, panel discussions, and breakout Action Labs. Global forums are held at the Royal Palace in Stockholm and bring together top business leaders, political leaders, academics, and civil society representatives to discuss pressing issues related to children‚Äôs rights and business. Regional forums are designed to tackle children‚Äôs rights issues faced by that particular region with regional leaders in business, politics, academics, and civil society. = Global forums = To date, five global forums have been held at the Royal Palace. Approximately 300 global leaders in business, politics, civil society and academia have attended each of the forums. Each event has its own theme on issues concerning children‚Äôs rights and business. The latest global forum was 11 April 2018 and discussed investing in every child. During the 2018 Forum, the Global Child Forum Pledge was launched to encourage action amongst participants post-Forum. Additionally, for the first time, the Forum included child participants, Indonesian child laborers from the It's Time to Talk! report on child labour. = Regional forums = The regional forum is held every year in a new location. The forums brings together approximately 300 regional leaders in business, politics, civil society and academia to discuss issues concerning children‚Äôs rights and business within the context of their region. To date, the Global Child Forum has held four regional forums: one in the Middle East and North Africa, Southern Africa, Southeast Asia and South America.

The benchmark reports, written in collaboration with the Boston Consulting Group, are developed to be presented at regional forums and evaluate the top 300 publicly traded companies from regions where regional forums are to be held, and assesses their commitment to children‚Äôs rights issues. Previously, the 2016 benchmark highlighted how the Nordic region lagged below the global average on children‚Äôs rights issues. During the S√£o Paulo Forum in 2017, Global Child Forum presented a report which revealed that South American companies are underperforming overall in addressing children's rights. The Global Child Forum also conducts case studies on companies who have scored highly on benchmarks.

Evensong is the common name for a Christian church service originating in the Anglican tradition as part of the reformed practice of the Daily Office or canonical hours. The service may also be referred to as Evening Prayer, but Evensong is the more common name when the service is musical. It is roughly the equivalent of Vespers in the Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran churches, although it was originally formed by combining the monastic offices of Vespers and Compline. Although many churches now take their services from Common Worship or other modern prayer books, if a church has a choir, Choral Evensong from the Book of Common Prayer often remains in use because of the greater musical provision.  Liturgy  Services of Evensong are centred around reading from the Bible and singing the psalms and the canticles Magnificat and Nunc dimittis. The original liturgy for Evensong is found in the Anglican Book of Common Prayer in its different versions used around the world.  Music  In a fully choral service of Evensong, all of the service except the confession of sin, lessons, and some of the final prayers are sung or chanted by the officiating minister and the choir. In cathedrals, or on particularly important days in the church calendar, the canticles are performed in elaborate settings. In churches where a choir is not present, simpler versions of the psalms and canticles are usually sung by the congregation, sometimes with responses and collects spoken rather than sung. Said services of Evening Prayer, where the musical setting is omitted altogether, are also sometimes referred to as Evensong. The choral or sung part of Evensong begins with the opening responses sung by the minister and choir (or congregation) alternately. The psalms are then sung usually in a style known as Anglican chant, but sometimes plainsong settings of the psalms may be used instead. Then follow the Bible readings and the canticles. There are countless settings of the canticles, but a number of composers have contributed works which are performed regularly across the Anglican Communion. These range from late Renaissance composers such as Thomas Tallis, William Byrd and Orlando Gibbons, through Victorian composers such as Charles Villiers Stanford, Thomas Attwood Walmisley to later masters of the form such as Herbert Murrill and Basil Harwood. Herbert Howells composed 18 settings, including Magnificat and Nunc dimittis for St Paul's Cathedral. Charles Wood composed several settings, including Magnificat and Nunc dimittis in D which has been called an \\"epitome of Church of England worship\\". Settings from outside the core tradition of Anglican church music have also become popular, with examples by Michael Tippett, Giles Swayne and Arvo P√§rt who composed Magnificat and Nunc dimittis at different times. Evensong may have plainchant substituted for Anglican chant and in High Church parishes may conclude with Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament (or a modified form of \\"Devotions to the Blessed Sacrament\\") and the carrying of the reserved sacrament under a humeral veil from the high altar to an altar of repose, to the accompaniment of music. The service may also include hymns. The first of these may be called the Office Hymn, and will usually be particularly closely tied to the liturgical theme of the day, and may be an ancient plainchant setting. This will usually be sung just before the psalm(s) or immediately before the first canticle and may be sung by the choir alone. Otherwise any hymns normally come toward the end of the service, maybe one either side of the sermon (if there is one), or following the anthem. These hymns will generally be congregational.  Churches offering Evensong  =Great Britain= The choir rehearsing for Evensong in York Minster A parish church choir at All Saints' Church, Northampton singing Evensong Most cathedrals of the Church of England, from where the service originates, and a number of university college chapels (e.g. in the University of Cambridge, the University of Oxford, the University of St Andrews, the University of Durham and King's College Londonhttp://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/principal/dean/chaplaincy/prayeratkings/strand/college- chapel.aspx) offer this service regularly, often daily. Most of the cathedrals of the Church in Wales and the Scottish Episcopal Church also offer choral Evensong. Choral Evensong is usually sung during term time; at other times, it is most often replaced with said Evening Prayer. Aside from the cathedrals and collegiate chapels, Evensong is also sung in many parish churches around England where there is a choral tradition. There may be a choral service each Sunday or less frequently, such as on a monthly basis or only on feast days in the liturgical calendar. Many churches in central London have a professional choir and have a weekly service of Choral Evensong, among them All Saints, Margaret Street, Holy Trinity Sloane Square and St Bride's, Fleet Street. =Ireland= Most of the larger churches and cathedrals of the Church of Ireland offer Evensong. It is sung six times a week at St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, twice at Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, and once at Trinity College, Dublin. Additionally, although rarely, some parish churches hold Evensong; however, this is most often replaced with Evening Prayer. = United States and Canada = Most of the larger cathedrals and large parishes of the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada offer choral evensong, including: * Cathedral Church of the Redeemer, Calgary, Alberta * Christ Church Cathedral, Vancouver, British Columbia * St. Bartholomew's Anglican Church (Toronto) * Church of the Incarnation, Dallas, Texas * Grace Cathedral, San Francisco, California * Washington National Cathedral, D. C. * St Thomas's Church, New York City * Trinity Cathedral, Cleveland, Ohio *St. Paul's, Cleveland Heights, Ohio * St. George's Cathedral, Kingston, Ontario *St. Paul's Cathedral, London, Ontario *St. James' Cathedral, Toronto, Ontario * St Mark's Cathedral, Seattle, Washington *Trinity Episcopal Cathedral (Little Rock, Arkansas) *Christ Church Cathedral, Houston, Texas *The Cathedral of St. Philip, Atlanta, Georgia *St. Peter's Anglican Cathedral (Tallahassee, Florida) =Africa= Christchurch Cathedral Choir, Lagos Throughout the countries of Africa with a large Anglican presence, Evensong is also offered, for instance in the Cathedral Church of Christ, Lagos, Nigeria, St George's Cathedral, Cape Town, South Africa and every Sunday at the Cathedral Church of St Cyprian, Kimberley, South Africa = Australia and New Zealand = The choir in procession at a service at St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne. Most of the cathedrals of the Anglican Church of Australia offer choral Evensong at least weekly, with St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne offering daily Evensong. Likewise in the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia, Evensong is offered at the cathedrals in Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin, and Wellington. = Asia = *St John's Cathedral, Hong Kong *St Andrew's Cathedral, Singapore *St Mary's Cathedral, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia *Rikkyo All Saints' Chapel, Tokyo, Japan *Rikkyo St. Paul's Chapel, Saitama, Japan = Non-Anglican churches= The popularity of Evensong has spread to other churches, particularly churches of the Presbyterian Church (USA) and United Methodist churches which use a formal liturgical worship style. Examples in the Presbyterian Church include Fourth Presbyterian Church (Chicago) and Independent Presbyterian Church (Birmingham, Alabama) both of which offer Evensong services on a seasonal basis, as does Peachtree Road United Methodist Churchhttp://www.prumc.org in Atlanta, Georgia. There are some Roman Catholic churches and abbeys in England offering choral Evensong: These include Ampleforth Abbey, Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral, the Birmingham Oratory, Ealing Abbey, Leeds Cathedral, Downside Abbey, the London Oratory, and Westminster Cathedral.http://www.choralevensong.org/home.php Loyola University Maryland, a Jesuit Catholic university in Baltimore, Maryland, celebrates a half-hour Evensong on Thursday evenings, although this has been temporarily suspended. In Scotland, some larger churches (and former cathedrals belonging to the Church of Scotland) hold Evensong, including Glasgow Cathedral, Paisley Abbey (2nd Sunday of each month), and Edinburgh Cathedral. The Basilica of St. Nicholas in Amsterdam holds Choral Evensong on Saturdays.  Broadcasts  The BBC has, since 1926, broadcast a weekly service of Choral Evensong. It is broadcast (usually live) on BBC Radio 3 on Wednesdays at 15:30 and often repeated on the following Sunday. Between February 2007 and September 2008, the service was broadcast on Sunday only. The service comes live from an English cathedral or collegiate institution. However, it is occasionally a recording or is replaced by a different form of service or a service from a church elsewhere in the world or of another denomination. The most recent broadcast is available on the BBC iPlayer for up to a week after the original broadcast. There is also an archive available. In response to the Covid-19 Pandemic, St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Pasadena has expanded its Chorus blog to include daily Morning Song and Evensong recordings of its virtual choir. The Chant Scores are all public domain, and the scriptures used under a less restrictive MIT License, so all materials can be legally distributed and used by any group or church as part of their online liturgy, without performance or publishing rights concerns.

In the 2016 census, Freshwater Creek had a population of 414 people. The community comprises farming and rural properties, with a small township on the Anglesea Road and Dickins Road. The township has several shops and a cafe. The community volunteer CFA building is located on Dickins Road. Alongside is the Community Hall, tennis courts, BBQ, public toilets and playground. The Freshwater Creek Riding Club is next door to the Community Hall with their cross country course along Duneed Creek. Opposite is Red Gum Run Arena Polo. The Revival Centre Church Camp is located behind the service station. The Freshwater Creek Steiner School is located on McIntyres Road. Not for profit, food recycling composting organisation City Harvest is co-located at The Farmers Place. Freshwater Creek Post Office opened on 21 January 1860, was provisionally closed on 25 January 1961, and closed on 25 March 1961. A school was opened at Freshwater Creek in 1856 as a Wesleyan denominational school. It became a department school State School No. 256 with the introduction of state schools in 1883. A new weatherboard building was opened at the same time, following the bluestone building from 1856. The school's honour roll from World War I is now located in the Community Hall and is listed on the Victorian War Heritage Inventory. In 1994, Freshwater Creek, Connewarre and Mt Duneed Primary Schools were amalgamated at Mt Duneed.The Freshwater Creek school building was moved to the Waurn Ponds Campus of Deakin University where it formed part of a collection of historic Australian buildings. It remained there for some years and then moved to Mt Duneed Primary School as an extra classroom. A new independent school within the township, Freshwater Creek Steiner School, opened on a different site in 2000. St David's Lutheran Church and Cemetery, located on Anglesea Road, is a historic church which is both listed on the Victorian Heritage Register and classified by the National Trust of Australia. The current bluestone church dates from 1866, although a prior church had existed on the site since 1859. The church has a strong association with the early German pioneers who settled in the area, and the attached churchyard cemetery has historical significance as one of the few in the state to still survive. Services are still held at the church on the 3rd Sunday of every month, run by St Paul's Lutheran Church in Grovedale, which was designed by the same architect. During the early 1970s Freshwater Creek School Headmaster was Graham Brown who had 4 children - Phillip, Noel, Helen and Wendy. Wendy went to Oberon High School and after a brief marriage to Michael Harmer from Geelong, became the famous comedienne Wendy Harmer.

College Remediation Rate According to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 12% of the Midd-West High School graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics, IPEDS Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, 2008 Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. Dual enrollment Midd-West High School offers a dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school.

The district also has a dual enrollment agreement with Lackawanna College located in Sunbury, Pennsylvania.Dandes, Rick., College offers high schoolers opportunity to earn credits The Daily Item, August 17, 2017 The state offered a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. Under state rules, other students that reside in the district, who attend a private school, a charter school or are home schooled are eligible to participate in this program.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Dual Enrollment Guidelines, 2010 In 2010, Governor Edward Rendell eliminated the grants to students, from the Commonwealth, due to a state budget crisis. ACE Midd-West School District students have access to Bloomsburg University's Summer College and Advanced College Experience (ACE) during the summer of their sophomore, junior and senior years (after high school graduation). Tuition is deeply discounted to 75% of the regular student rate. Successful students earn college credits that can be readily transferred to other Pennsylvania public colleges and universities through the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Center (PA TRAC) system. Alternative Education In May 2014, the School Board approved a 2014-2015 Agreement as outlined by the Pennsylvania Department of Education Alternative Education for Disruptive Youth Guidelines between the Midd-West School District and PA Treatment & Healing (PATH) for alternative education services needed for designated students at a per diem rate of $51.00 per day/per student and a rate of $56.00 per day/per student for special education.Midd_west School Board Secretary, Midd_West School Board Meeting Minutes, May 2014 Students who are not behaving appropriately in the school building setting may be assigned to alternative education. School safety and bullying The Midd-West School District administration reported there were seven incidents of bullying in the District in 2012. Additionally, there were seven assaults on pupils and 10 sexual incidents involving students including two assaults. The local law enforcement was involved in thirty one incidents at the schools, making 24 arrests. Each year the school safety data is reported by the district to the Safe School Center which then publishes the compiled reports online. Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school. The federal No Child Left Behind Act established the Unsafe School Choice Option. Each state that receives federal funds was mandated to establish a statewide policy requiring that a student at a ‚Äúpersistently dangerous‚Äù public school be allowed to transfer/enroll in a safe public school. The policy permitted a student who becomes the victim of a violent criminal offense, while in or on the grounds of any public school that he or she attends, to transfer to a safe public school. Each year since 2006, the Pennsylvania Department of Education has released a list of Persistently Dangerous Schools. Midd-West School District schools have not been on the lists. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the District must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. The Midd-West School Board prohibits bullying by district students and faculty. A policy approved in May 2006 defines bullying and cyberbullying. The Board directs that complaints of bullying shall be investigated promptly, and corrective action shall be taken when allegations are verified. No reprisals or retaliation shall occur as a result of good faith reports of bullying. Midd-West School Board Bullying Policy 218.3 Education standards relating to student safety and anti harassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Wellness policy Midd-West School Board established a district-wide Wellness policy in 2006 - Student Wellness Policy 246. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education and physical education that are aligned with the Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The policy requires that the Superintendent or designee shall report to the Board on the district‚Äôs compliance with law and policies related to student wellness. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Midd-West School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health‚Äôs extensive immunization mandates. Beginning with the 2017-18 school year, high school students are mandated to receive a dose of MCV meningococcal conjugate vaccine for 12th grade entry. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health made available to each Pennsylvania high school the overdose antidote drug naloxone in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training developed by the National Association of School Nurses. The cost was covered by a grant from a private foundation. =Highmark Healthy High 5 grant= In 2011, Midd-West HIgh School received funding through a Highmark Healthy High 5 grant. The School received $$9,914 which was used to purchase equipment and supplies for the Mustangs on the Move program, a circuit training program.Highmark Foundation, 2011 School Challenge Grants, 2011 Beginning in 2006, Highmark Foundation engaged in a 5-year, $100 million program to promote lifelong healthy behaviors in children and adolescents through local nonprofits and schools. Classrooms for the Future grant Midd-West School District was awarded a $77,993.00 grant under Classrooms for the Future 2006 to purchase computers for the high school students' use along with paying for mandatory teacher training to optimize the computers' use. Computers were for core academic courses: English, Math, Science, and History. In 2007 the HIgh School received $300,000. The district received the final payment of $42,706 for the 2008-09 school year. In total the district received: $420,699 in state funds. This money was in addition to all regular state and federal funding. Extracurriculars The Midd-West School District offers students a wide variety of clubs, activities and an extensive, costly sports program.Midd-West School Administration, General Fund Budget 2013-14, June 2013 Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy. The PIAA mandates that student athletes must be passing at least four full-credit subjects to participate in sports. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. According to PA Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting Act 126 of 2014, all volunteer coaches and all those who assist in student activities, must have criminal background checks. Like all school district employees, they must also attend an anti child abuse training once every three years.Eleanor Chute., New Pa. law expands clearance requirements for school volunteers, employees, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, December 15, 2014Ali Stevens., Child Protective Services Law impacts schools, WKOK.com 1070AM, January 6, 2015 =Sports= MWSD's mascot is the mustang. School colors are Carolina blue and dull silver. Just before the merger of the two high schools, high school students were asked to vote on a new mascot and school colors to replace the old West Snyder HS Mounties (colors: red and white) and Middleburg HS Middies (colors: blue and gold). Article XVI-C of the Public School Code requires the disclosure of interscholastic athletic opportunities for all public secondary school entities in Pennsylvania. All school entities with grades 7-12 are required to annually collect data concerning team and financial information for all male and female athletes beginning with the 2012-13 school year and submit the information to the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Beginning with the 2013-14 school year, all non-school (booster club and alumni) contributions and purchases must also be reported to PDE. According to Pennsylvania‚Äôs Safety in Youth Sports Act, all sports coaches, paid and volunteer, are required to annually complete the Concussion Management Certification Training and present the certification before coaching. Coaches receive compensation as outlined in the teachers' union contract. When athletic competition exceeds the regular season, additional compensation is paid.Area School District, Area School District Teacher Union Contract, 2014 The District funds: ;Boys: *Baseball - AAAA *Basketball - AAAA *Football in cooperative agreement Juniata County School District *Bowling - AAAAAA *Cross Country - AA *Golf - AA *Soccer - AA *Track and Field - AA *Wrestling - AA ;Girls: *Basketball - AAAA *Bowling - AAAAAA *Cheer - AAAAA *Cross Country - AA *Field Hockey - A *Lacrosse - AA *Soccer (Fall) - AA *Softball - AAAA *Track and Field - AA *According to PIAA directory July 2012 Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletics Association, PIAA School Directory, 2012 Note: The football program was a co-operative program with East Juniata High School, and plays under the East Juniata flag (Colors: Red & gray, nicknamel: Tigers), even though their field is in Beaver Springs on Midd-West property.

Retrieved 17 June 2014. His father was the proprietor of the public tea gardens at Marylebone. In his tenth year, he was sent to Westminster School, and at the age of fifteen he was transferred to Mr Fountaine's fashionable seminary at Marylebone. Next he proceeded to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, whence he graduated B.A. in 1757.Graduati Cantabr. 1823, p. 479; Addit. MS. 5882, f. 97. On his return home he translated from the Italian several burlettas and adapted them to the English stage. One of these, he says, was 'La Serva Padrona,' or the 'Servant-Mistress,' of Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, performed in Marylebone Gardens in 1757; but it seems that the real translator was Stephen Storace.Baker, Biogr. Dramatica, 1812, iii. 259 Ordination Trusler took holy orders, becoming a priest in 1759. He was curate successively of Enford, Wiltshire, of Ware, Hertfordshire, at Hertford, at the Hythe church, Colchester, of Ockley, Surrey, and of St Clement Danes in the Strand, London. In 1761, Dr Bruce, the king's chaplain at Somerset House, employed him as his assistant and procured for him the chaplaincy to the Poultry Compter. He also held a lectureship in the city. At this period he took a house at Rotherhithe. However, clerical work was not enough for Trusler. In 1762, he established an academy for teaching oratory 'mechanically,' but, as it did not pay, he soon gave it up. To acquire a knowledge of physic he admitted himself a perpetual pupil of Drs Hunter and Fordyce. He then went to Leyden University to take the degree of M.D., but his name does not appear in the catalogue of graduates in that university. However, he either obtained or assumed the title of doctor, and he is frequently styled LL.D. He superintended for some time the Literary Society established in 1765 with the object of abolishing publishers.Notes and Queries, 4th ser. iii. 421. In 1769, Trusler sent circulars to every parish in England and Ireland proposing to print in script type, in imitation of handwriting, about a hundred and fifty sermons at the price of one shilling each, to save the clergy both study and the trouble of transcribing. This scheme appears to have met with success. Trusler next established a printing and bookselling business upon an extensive and lucrative scale. At one time he resided in Red Lion Street, Clerkenwell, and also at Boyle Street. He afterwards lived at Bath on the profits of his trade, and subsequently on an estate of his own at Englefield Green, Middlesex. In 1806, he published at Bath the first part of his autobiography, entitled The Memoirs of the Life of the Revd. Dr. Trusler, 4to. Only part i. appeared, and, it is said, the author sought to suppress it.Lowndes, Bibl. Manual, ed. Bohn, p. 2715. The remainder of the memoirs in Trusler's autograph were in 1851 in the possession of James Crossley of Manchester.Notes and Queries, 1st ser. iii. 110.

It is a Grade II* listed building situated on an elevation over 700 feet above sea level in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England and was once the residence of the Lords of the Manor of North Bierley and Wibsey. Royds Hall With Southerly Garden Royds Hall Maps of Yorkshire dated 1600 or earlier show Bowling hall, now a museum, and Royds Hall as the only two houses in the district. The house is also mentioned in the Domesday book. History Up to the year 1307 the Lord of the Manor of Royds Hall was William De Swillington. He left no heir, and after a short succession of owners the Hall and its estates passed to William Rookes of Rookes Hall, Norwood Green. In 1313 The Rookes Family became the tenants of the land and owners of the land in 1538 when the land was granted to William Rookes for Knights service during the dissolution of the monasteries. This entailed 40 days annual service to the monarch, then King Henry VIII, and the duties and attendant privileges which were transmitted to the heirs of the House of Rookes. Monument to the Low Moor Iron Works. After 500 years, Edward‚ÄúThe History and Topography of Bradford‚Äù, by John James was the last of the Rookes line to inhabit the family seat. Edward was a colourful character who changed his name to Rookes Leedes, when he married a wealthy heiress, Mary Leedes. He was a prominent racehorse breeder and constructed a racecourse at the property. He was actively involved in the construction of Turnpike Roads in the area and was mainly instrumental in the cutting of the Leeds Liverpool Canal. Despite the large fortune his bride endowed him he rapidly ran into debt, through gambling, and he ended his days in debtors' prison in 1785. In 1788, Reverend Joseph Dawson purchased the estate through the Low Moor Iron Company. The Reverend, trained as a scientist, was the chief technologist of the company's success. During his time at the property, he invited his friend Joseph Priestley, who went on to gain scientific notoriety, to stay at the property. Joseph Priestley discovered Oxygen and it is thought that he carried out many of his experiments at Royds Hall. Successive chairmen of the Low Moor Iron Company occupied the property until the 1920s. Finally in 1932 Royds Hall was purchased by a private owner who stayed until 1975. Two further owners since lovingly maintained and improved Royds Hall,‚ÄúRoyds Hall Manor Call Book of 1835‚Äù including millionaire businessman Sir Earnest Hall who was responsible for much of the restoration of the property, returning it to its former glory. In 2014, Multibrands International Ltd,‚ÄúMultibrands International Ltd‚Äù a Bradford-based company with operations worldwide, became only the fifth owners of this magnificent property. Royds Hall Court Courts There is an interesting link to feudal law, two courts were held here, a Court Baron and a Court Leet. These were manorial courts and the right to hold them was granted to the Lord Of Manor by the crown. Details of land encroachment, weights and measures and debts were argued before the Lord, and the procedure undoubtedly speeded by local justice although the decisions may have been prejudiced. Buried Treasure Buried Treasure In 1641‚ÄúRoyds Hall‚Äù, by Jim Jarrat the Civil War loomed. Naturally, the Rookes supported the cause of the King. The subsequent decline and persecution of the Royalists during the Interregnum also marked a decline in the fortunes of the Rookes family. In the eighteenth century, when Edward Rookes Leedes held ownership, a man was ploughing on land belonging to Woodside Farm when he came across a large earthenware jar filled with gold coins of the reigns of Mary, Elizabeth, James I and Charles I. This was believed to be wealth that the Rookes had hidden from the roundheads, wealth that William Rookes did not mention when his estates were under sequestration in 1647.‚ÄúMeeting of Commonwealth Commissioners at Clayton Heights‚Äù September 24th 1647 There is a record in existence of the rents and personal properties he delivered to the Cromwellian commissioners who attended the Old Dolphin Inn at Clayton Heights, with no mention of any buried treasure. More recently, a man with a metal detector discovered another jar (this time of silver coins) in Judy Woods. This involved him becoming involved in a bitter struggle with Bradford Metropolitan Council, who claimed (unsuccessfully) that the treasure was rightfully theirs, the find being made on council land. Architecture A significant property has stood on the site for over 800 years, evolving through the ages from a timber-framed structure into the grand residence seen today. The timber framed house is dated to 1458. In 1640 William Rookes had the original timber frame encased in a stone fa√ßade and extended the property in 1651 to comprise two halls with four gables to the southern elevation.‚ÄúBritish Listed Buildings‚Äù, Date Listed: 4 September 1952 The final evolution of the main property took place in 1770 with the construction of the easterly cross wing. This is built in a typically grand Georgian style and provided the sixth gable which stands above the rest of the property. The Gardens There are numerous gardens,‚ÄúLandscape Character Supplementary Planning Document‚Äù, Volume 5: South Bradford, October 2008 all meticulously maintained and presented in a history of fashions. =Easterly Garden= A driveway leads from cast iron gates to the Marble hall's front door around a planted roundabout and on to the paddock land.

The terraced gardens are presented in a variety of formal and historical styles which include a knot garden, parterres, a rose walk, wildflower woodland and vegetable gardens. There is a raised stone terrace, fountains and an open gazebo. Westerly Garden Nearby Woodland Royds Hall Great Woods, comprising;‚ÄúThe Friends of Judy Woods‚Äù =Old Hanna Wood= This rather remote section of the woods surrounds Royds Hall on one side. All paths through it eventually come out by the seat at Royds Hall Lane, from which there is a view. A sweep of hills stretching to the boundaries of Derbyshire, Cheshire and Lancashire may be observed. Below, is Norwood Green and its clocktower, beyond which the eye is carried up to the commanding tower of Coley Church, with Halifax Beacon behind, topped by its little white house. Further afield, the ornate top of the Wainhouse Tower may be seen, poking up from the Calder Valley. Other landmarks include Fosters Mill at Queensbury, Reevy Beacon, the Emley Moor Transmitter, and the Jubilee Tower on Castle Hill above Huddersfield. The prospect is truly impressive. =Judy Woods= Judy Woods Judy Woods‚ÄúRoyds Hall Manor- The History‚Äù, UK Wildlife Portal, Judy woods History and Heritage is situated to the south boundary of Royds Hall and is the third-largest woodland in the Bradford district at a size of forty hectares. The present name comes from Judy North or ‚ÄúGurt Judy‚Äù who lived in a cottage near Horse Close Bridge in the 1850s and 60s. She was the second wife of Joseph North whose family had tended the ‚Äúpleasure gardens‚Äù on the hillside by the bridge since the early 1800s. Following Joseph's death in 1850, first Judy herself and then John Barraclough, Judy's son by her first marriage took over as gardener. In the 1861 census Judy is described as ‚Äúseller of sweet meats‚Äù no doubt to the visitors to the gardens. James Parker mentioned Judy in his books, notably ‚ÄúRambles from Hipperholme to Tong,‚Äù published 1904. In them he included several images of Judy and her son John O‚ÄôJudy's and related how she sold parking pigs, sticks of spice and ginger beer. He calls the woods Royds Hall Woods and the bridge Horse Close Bridge. It seems that Parker's books, written over thirty years after her death, popularised the woods with a new generation who took to calling the bridge, Judy Brig and soon the woods were grouped together collectively as Judy Woods. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  Stream in Judy Woods  Waterfall in Judy Woods  Path in Judy Woods }  References  Category:Grade II* listed buildings in West Yorkshire Category:Buildings and structures in Bradford ","title":"Royds Hall"},{"id":"43077424","text":"\\"Love Is the Sweetest Thing\\" is a popular song written in 1932 by British band leader and singer Ray Noble.

These events or situations are thought of as natural experiments that generate exogenous variations in variables that would otherwise be endogenous in the behavioral relationship of interest. An example from the economic study of education can be used to illustrate the approach. Here we might be interested in the effect of effect of an additional year of education (say X) on earnings (say Y). Those working with an experimentalist approach to econometrics would argue that such a question is problematic to answer because, and this is using their terminology, education is not randomly assigned. That is those with different education levels would tend to also have different levels of other variables. And these other variable, many of which would be unobserved (such as innate ability), also affect earnings. This renders the causal effect of extra years of schooling difficult to identify.

It is located in the southern side of the Sang-e Ghadimi square and beside the Bazaar of Kashan. It is one of the oldest structures in Kashan. The primary structure belonged possibly to the seljuq era, but it was destroyed by the Mongols during their invasions. Later it was rebuilt and repaired by Khaje Emad ed-Din. A quotation for this matter is an inscription in the old mihrab, in which it is mentioned that it is built in 623 Hijri (1226 AD) by Hassan ebn-e Arabschah in Kashan. The mihrab was in its original place until the last century, but it is kept now in the Museum of Islamic art in Berlin.' Jane Dieulafoy describes the mihrab as follows: ::::\\"Meydan mosque is a spacious structure with an appropriate architectural technique, but its distinctive characteristic in comparison with other similar structures is its exquisite mihrab, which is covered with splendid tiles with metal reflections. With respect to their high-quality these tiles are like the famous tiles of Imamzadeh Yahya in Varamin.\\" Abd ol-Ghaffar Najm od-Dole predicted well in 1882 the future of the mihrab as follows: ::::\\"The embossed tiles, which I saw in the mihrab of Meydan mosque, were very interesting and spectacular. Westerners will buy them at least 2000 Tomans and will take the poor tiles away, if they can get a chance.\\" The mosque had in its past glorious times high iwans, a splendid inner dome space, large yard, Shabestan and Howz hall, but despite many repairs most parts of the mosque have been destroyed. The mosque had a special social and political importance, which can be realized from many orders written above its portal. These orders date back to the 15th century in the Kara Koyunlu era until the 19th century in the Qajar era. These orders include guidelines, regulations and commands about the buying and selling of goods and food stuffs with approved prices of that time and about the prohibition of gamble and acts against the sharia. The portal of the mosque stands out because of its pure Iranian architectural techniques. The former stone minaret was destroyed in 1778 in the late Safavid era by an earthquake.

It was named after William Marsden, Second Secretary to the Admiralty by Matthew Flinders in 1802. It is the western extremity of Nepean Bay and has been the site of a navigation aid since 1915. Description Point Marsden is the most easterly point of the Kangaroo Island coast that directly adjoins Investigator Strait. It is the termination for a pair of coastlines - one extending from Cape Borda in the west and the other extending from Cape Rouge from the south in Nepean Bay. It is described as being ‚Äòa rocky headland of moderate height‚Äô and that ‚ÄòHigh wooded land rises about W of it.‚Äô It is the western extremity of the opening to Nepean Bay. Formation, geology & oceanography  Point Marsden was formed when the sea reached its present level 7,500 years ago after sea levels started to rise at the start of the Holocene. The cliff line which includes Point Marsden consists of a metamorphic rock belonging to the Kangaroo Island Group bedrock called Boxing Bay Formation. The water adjoining Point Marsden drops to a depth of at the outer edge of the wave-cut platform at the base of its cliff face. History =Aboriginal use= By 1999, the literature had not cited any archaeological discoveries specific to Aboriginal use of land in the immediate vicinity of Point Marsden. =European discovery= Point Marsden was discovered by Matthew Flinders on 21 March 1802 and named after William Marsden, Second Secretary to the Admiralty. Navigation aid A navigation aid consisting of a tower with a single flashing light was installed in 1915. The light which is above sea level, assists vessels underway at night in Investigator Strait. The need for a navigation aid at Point Marsden was suggested as early as 1882 and was one of four sites recommended for immediate construction of navigation aids in 1912 when the responsibility for navigation transferred from the South Australian government to the Australian government. Economic activity As of 2014, the land adjoining Point Marsden is used for farming. Farming activity at the locality is reported as being underway as early as 1908 with most of the land being cleared of native vegetation by 1945.

Early life and family Born on 3 June 1759, Barne was the fourth son of Miles Barne of Sotterley, Suffolk, and his second wife, Mary Thornhill, a daughter of George Thornhill of Diddington, Huntingdonshire.Escott (2009) He was educated at Westminster School in the years 1772‚Äì73, before admission to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1774; he matriculated in 1777.Escott (2009) ; Venn and Venn (1940), p. 160 Military career After matriculating from Cambridge, Barne began his military career as a Cornet in the 7th Dragoons in 1778. His family connections furthered his promotion through the armed forces: Captain, 1783, Major, 1794, and Lieutenant-Colonel in 1799. Additionally, he was Commandant of the 7th Dragoons under the Duke of York in the Dutch Campaign of 1793-4 and in the Helder expedition of 1799.Suckling (1847), p. 278 He retired from active service in 1804, before taking up a commission in the Yeomanry Volunteers in 1805.Escott (2009) Member of Parliament After his elder brother, Snowdon Barne, took up a Commission on the Custom Board in 1812, the seat he had held in the constituency of Dunwich fell vacant. The Barne family had held this seat in their ‚Äòpocket‚Äô since 1764 and its dwindling population led to it becoming a notorious \\"Rotten Borough\\". There was, therefore, no real contest to Michael Barne superseding his brother and he became the M.P. in 1812. He was not an active Member and is not known to have spoken in a debate prior to 1820, but did vote, largely with the Government, on some measures prior to that year; for instance, he voted against Catholic relief in 1813 and 1817, and supported ministers on army matters and property tax in 1816.Stokes (1986) ; Escott (2009) He voted (1821) with the Government over its conduct in the trial of Queen Caroline, and against Catholic relief in 1822 and 1825. He was returned again in 1826, and voted against Catholic relief twice more in 1827 and 1828; he was expected to vote for Catholic Emancipation in 1829, but opposed it and went on to oppose Jewish Emancipation the following year. In 1830, he stepped down to allow his son, Frederick Barne, become MP for the borough.Escott (2009) Family and later life On 2 October 1798, Barne married Mary Boucherett, sister of Ayscoghe Boucherett, MP for Great Grimbsy, and daughter of the elder Ayscoghe Boucherett, of Willingham and Stallingborough, Lincolnshire, of which county he was High Sheriff in 1754, and Mary White, his wife.Escott (2009). It is worth pointing out that this article is linked to Ayscoghe Boucherett, the MP, however, in reality, that Boucherett was a brother; both the chronology and his entries in Burke and Burke, A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry, 1847, vol. i, p. 122, and in Howard and Crisp (1899), p. 158, show this to be the case.

The film is an official remake of the 2011 American film Warrior. It stars Akshay Kumar and Sidharth Malhotra in the lead roles with Jacqueline Fernandez, Jackie Shroff and Shefali Shah in supporting roles. The first look poster of the film was released on 9 March 2015 and film released on 14 August 2015 on Independence Day weekend. Plot The film opens in medias res where street fighting issues are raised in Mumbai. Sports chairman Peter Braganza (Kiran Kumar) expresses his desire of making street fighting a legal sport and decides to open a league called Right 2 Fight (R2F). Meanwhile, imprisoned Garson \\"Gary\\" Fernandes (Jackie Shroff), a recovering alcoholic and former MMA expert under rehabilitation, is released from his jail term and his younger son Monty (Sidharth Malhotra) comes to pick him up. Monty gets tensed when his father asks about his elder son David and takes him away to their home. At home Gary acts protective of all the belongings of his wife Maria, who died many years ago. David (Akshay Kumar), now a physics teacher, has a daughter with kidney ailment. Unable to arrange money from the bank and other sources, he starts to earn money through street fights as he was once a promising MMA fighter when he was younger. This stresses out his wife Jenny (Jacqueline Fernandez) as she is worried about David. Meanwhile, Gary, who misses his wife Maria (Shefali Shah), starts hallucinating about her and violently attacks a mirror from self hating about how he destroyed his family, Monty rushes to stop and comfort father realizing how much regret he has. Gary then tries to meet David but the latter ends up throwing Monty and Gary out of his house in rage after Gary sees his granddaughter and learns David named her after his mother Maria. Through flashbacks Monty is revealed to be Gary's illegitimate child. Maria nevertheless loved Monty, as she did David. The two brothers had a close, loving relationship until David was 18 and Monty was 15. On the night of Monty's 15th birthday, Gary came home drunk and apologizes to Maria for destroying the family, but mentions his lover Sarah's name, instead of Maria's. An enraged Maria confronts Gary about this. In a drunken state Gary hits Maria who is injured from hitting her head on the furniture and dies. A furious David pushes Gary aside, when Monty comes close to Maria who reached out to him before passing, David angrily pushes him away, holding his father and half-brother equally responsible for his mother's death. This is what created the rift between Gary, Monty and David. David later loses his job in the school when the principal Shobhit Desai (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) learn's about David's involvement in street fights. Monty, who wants to be a fighter, is then introduced to Suleiman Pasha (Ashutosh Rana), a fight agent. Suleiman fixes a match with Mustafa in which Monty is defeated. This enrages Gary but Monty has a rematch with Mustafa, where Monty defeats Mustafa after listening to his father‚Äôs advice and is declared a selected fighter for R2F by Peter. The fight is recorded and uploaded to YouTube and soon Monty becomes an internet sensation. Monty undergoes training to become the R2F champion. Meanwhile, David too decides to be a full-time fighter and Jenny encourages him to do so. Suleiman trains David and arranges a match while Monty celebrates his victory at a bar. David soon is victorious in the fight and is accepted for R2F. R2F begins its grand debut and soon becomes a sensation as fighters from all over the world showed their interest in the league. Monty and David at first have a solid time winning till each goes up against a fighter that pushes them to the limits. Eventually the brothers make it to the finals. Gary, feeling guilty about his sons fighting each other instead of loving one another because of his mistake leaves the arena. Jenny, David‚Äôs students, and everyone back at Suleiman‚Äôs fight club watch the match which becomes brutal from the heated rivalry between the brothers. During the fight, David breaks Monty's shoulder which causes David concern as Monty refuses to give up. Gary rushes towards the cage and apologizes for his mistake and tells David not to release his anger towards his brother. Monty continues to fight despite David‚Äôs plea to stop. David gets Monty in a rear naked choke hold and tells Monty not to fight anymore. Monty in turn says to continue to choke him because David is selfish and never considered how Monty felt that night telling him Maria was also his mother and how lonely he was without her and David in his life. David moved to tears now realizing how much pain he caused Monty finally apologizes and Monty allows David to win the championship. David takes Monty in his arms and both brothers walk backstage now having finally reconciled.

If the start was good, if not phenomenal, there was some good escalation waiting to take place on the rest of the weekend. Saturday was always going to be the key for the film and the Karan Malhotra film managed to cross the 21 crore mark. Sunday did not see as many footfalls as Saturday but still did better than Friday, as a result of which 52.08 crores came in once the weekend was through. Brothers made quite a low business on its 3rd day i.e. 1st Sunday at the box office. The movie collected 15.45 crores on Sunday, which is almost equal to its Friday business (15.20 crores). Nevertheless, thanks to its super jump on Day 2, the film's overall opening weekend collections have come to a good amount of 52.08 crores. The film now stands as the 2nd Highest Weekend Grosser of the year. Bajrangi Bhaijaan, with 102.60 crores, holds the record of Top weekend grosser of 2015. The film went on to collect just 64.80 crores net in its first week in India which is a poor result because it has a big holiday.

It is owned by Andr√© Balazs, a hotel chain owner, who also owns the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, California and The Mercer Hotel in New York City. The head chef is Nuno Mendes. Manchester Square Fire Station Marylebone Fire Station, 1996 The Manchester Square Fire Station was built in 1889, by the London County Council Architect's Department, \\"in the Vulliamy manner\\". \\"Red brick with stone dressings; tiled roof. Free Tudor-Gothic style\\". It initially served as a fire station, and was one of the first fire stations in London. The original architect was Robert Pearsall. Originally known as Manchester Square Fire Station (Manchester Square is nearby), it was decommissioned in June 2005 by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority. For some years subsequently, it had been in occasional use as an exhibition space for local artists, as there was a long and complex planning process to convert it to a luxury hotel and restaurant. David Archer of Archer Humphryes Architects acted as lead architect for the project. Chiltern Firehouse hotel and restaurant The Chiltern Firehouse opened as a 26-suite hotel and 200 capacity restaurant in 2013. It is the first British establishment by American hotelier Andr√© Balazs. =Interior= The Firehouse features an open kitchen. The restaurant interior is designed by Paris-based Studio KO. The Independent's restaurant critic Tracey MacLeod described the interior by saying that \\"they've kept the huge firehouse doors, giving an almost rustic feel, while cleverly-placed mirrors create the illusion of infinite space.\\" Londonist reported: > The look of the space is unique. A ceiling clad with fabric that would feel > at home on the seats of the Bakerloo line, carpeted corridors your gran > would like, and a scattering of pot plants and nic-nacs lend a feel that's > simultaneously homely and nothing at all like a home you could imagine. Grace Dent of the London Evening Standard described a \\"glorious dining room that is part classic French brasserie, part industrial‚Äîsupporting pillars, a fireman's pole and low-hanging lights‚Äîand part chintzy in-joke with pot plants, ornaments, thick hallway carpets and marble tables.\\" =Chef and cuisine= In front of the Chiltern Firehouse, 2014 The Chiltern Firehouse's head chef is the Portuguese Nuno Mendes. Mendes was trained at the California Culinary Academy in the 1990s, worked at elBulli, and has worked with Wolfgang Puck, Rocco di Spirito, and Jean-Georges Vongerichten. In 2006, Mendes opened Bacchus, a gastropub in Hoxton, and later opened The Loft Project, from his own apartment in Shoreditch, \\"where some of the best chefs cooked in front of guests, offering a pioneering and intimate experience\\". In 2010, Mendes opened Viajante (Portuguese for \\"traveller\\") in Bethnal Green's Town Hall Hotel, inspired by world cuisines. Within its first year of opening it received a Michelin star and was included in the 2013 World's 50 Best Restaurants. Giles Coren of The Times referred to Mendes as \\"every restaurant critic's secret favourite cook\\". Also working in the kitchen is Dale Osborne previously at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. =Food hygiene failings= The Times reported in August 2014 that officers from Westminster City Council's food safety team had awarded the restaurant only two stars out of a possible five when the restaurant was inspected. Inspectors had found dirty surfaces, food served below safe temperatures, dirty fly screens, poor access to hot water and soap, and broken glass in a freezer. A former chef who spoke to The Times said: \\"Upstairs the diners could see the chefs working away in the open-plan kitchen, but downstairs it was a different story ...

Then, the place to go for your sushi (and a quick romp in the broom cupboard) was Nobu. These days, it's the Chiltern Firehouse\\". The Daily Mirror noted the Firehouse's exclusive reputation, asking: \\"Fancy booking a table at Chiltern Firehouse? Well unless your name is written on the Hollywood Walk of Fame then you may as well give up!\\" The Daily Telegraph reported a \\"rigorous screening process to accept bookings\\", saying: \\"Chiltern Firehouse is all about who's who and with the amount of detail gone into creating what has to be one of the loveliest and coolest new places in London, it's almost justified.\\" MacLeod appeared critical of the exclusivity of the Firehouse, writing: > The garage, once home to the fire engines, now revs with the self- > congratulatory hum of a fashionable crowd, who have scored a table despite a > bookings policy apparently borrowed from the North Korean tourist board. > [...] Appropriate perhaps, that in keeping with its previous incarnation, > the Firehouse seems to operate a strict no-civilians policy.

He has also worked as Professor of Egyptology at the Department of Archaeology, Faculty of Arts, Ain Shams University in Cairo. On 15 May 2011, he became Cultural Counselor and Head of the Educational Mission at the Embassy of Egypt in Berlin. On 16 June 2014 it was announced that he was to be appointed as Minister of Antiquities, a position he held until March 2016 when he was replaced by Khaled El-Anany after a cabinet reshuffle. Early life and education He was born in Cairo and attended high school there. In 1979, he registered with the Faculty of Archaeology, Cairo University. In July 1981, he was looking for a summer job as a student. He went to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and met with Mohamed Saleh, the vice director of the museum. He worked there for one month. In the summer of 1982, he worked at the museum again during a summer student job. He did work that brought him into contact with all departments of the museum. In 1983, he graduated from the Faculty of Archaeology, Cairo University. After his graduation, he did voluntary work at the museum for a month. After that, he joined the restoration team of the Coptic Museum for several months. In January 1984, he started his 15-month-long conscription service. He worked at the museum again from April 1985 to September 1987. He rejoined the Faculty at Cairo University to resume higher studies. The thesis of his Master's Degree was \\"St-Meskhnet hall at Dendera Temple, linguistic and cultural study\\" under the supervision of Abdelhalim Noureldin and partnership of Ola El-Aguizy. Through his work at the Museum he became acquainted with many Egyptologists and archaeologists who visited the Museum. Among those was Erich Winter at Trier University, who along with his wife visited Egypt in 1987 and were accompanied by the young Mamdouh Eldamaty during their 3-day visit to Siwa Oasis. This new contact proved to be quite useful as Winter encouraged the young Egyptologist to continue his studies under his supervision at the Department of Egyptology at Trier University. In October 1988 he worked as a curator at the Faculty of Archaeology Museum of Cairo University. During his work he got his master's degree in April 1989 in Egyptology from the same faculty. Immediately he left Egypt for Germany on leave to prepare for his PhD. Without any state-sponsored scholarships, it was rather difficult for him to get an entry visa to study in Germany without a guarantor. Thanks to the help and support of his Professor and guarantor, Mohamed Saleh, an entry visa was issued and he started his German-language courses at Cologne University as soon as he arrived in Germany. He supported himself by working during summer vacation. While in Cologne he had correspondence with Trier University. He was accepted to Trier University, which he joined in the winter semester of 1989/1990. He commenced his Trier residence by learning German until he acquired the Deutsche Sprachpr√ºfung f√ºr den Hochschulzugang which qualified him for regular study at the university. He registered for Egyptology as his major subject with classical archaeology and ethnology as minor subjects in the summer semester of 1991. During the winter semester of 1992/93, he registered for his PhD with the thesis ‚ÄòSokar-Osiris-Kapelle im Tempel von Dendera‚Äô for which he received a study scholarship from the Ministry of Culture at Rhineland-Palatinate that enabled him to conclude his studies in June 1995. During his stay in Germany, on 26 February 1992 he married Aida Abdelghany Ahmed, who studied sociology at Zagazig University. She accompanied him to Germany where she gave birth to their first daughter, Mariam, in Trier in 1993. Having concluded his PhD, he returned to Egypt in September 1995 but kept visiting Trier frequently in the years 1996, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2004 and 2007 in order to follow recent publications and studies on Egyptology. Back in Cairo, where the family got a son and another daughter, he resumed his work for the Faculty‚Äôs Museum until January 1996. Starting from January 1996, he became a lecturer for Egyptology at the Faculty of Tourism and Hotels, Cairo University, Fayoum Branch. Upon founding an archaeological department at the Faculty of Arts, Ain Shams University in August 1998, he moved to the new department as a lecturer for Egyptology until end of 2001. Career =Director General of Egyptian Museum in Cairo= At the beginning of 2001 he was appointed Director General of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, a post that he held until the end of January 2004. During his directorship, the Museum witnessed several far reaching activities, developing its cellar (April 2001), restoring old records of the Museum (May 2001), preparing for the second chamber for royal mummies (June 2001) and establishing a restoration laboratory for papyrus, in cooperation with Corrado Basile, Director of Istituto Internazionale del Papiro, Syracuse in Italy (March 2003). In July 2001 he presented a concept for the centennial of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, which included several projects to promote and develop the old institution. This concept was approved by Gaballa Ali Gaballa, the Secretary General of the Higher Council for Monuments, and by the Minister of Culture as well. These activities were performed in late 2002 in the time of the successor of Gaballa, Zahi Hawass, who gave this ceremony special attention. Eldamaty was assigned also to supervise the external exhibitions committee from May 2002 to February 2004. =Professor at Ain Shams University= Having concluded his assignment at the Egyptian Museum he returned to his main work in teaching at Ain Shams University. There he got the post of associate professor of Egyptology at the Faculty of Arts from 25 March 2001 until 20 August 2006. On 21 August he became a full professor of Egyptology and presided over the Department of Archaeology, Faculty of Arts at Ain Shams University from 12 September 2006 until 12 September 2009. At the same time, he was assigned to head the college center for studies, consultations, and training from 15 October 2008 until 13 October 2009 when he took over the post of director of the Open Education Center from 22 March 2009 until 15 November 2009. Starting from 13 September 2009 until 14 May 2011, he was the Dean of the Faculty of Arts at Ain Shams University. During his deanship he supervised the Project for Sustainable Development and Qualifying for Accreditation. This sustainable development specified certain criteria for the selection of university cadres, which was approved by the college council, albeit not by the university council due to the political conditions accompanying the Arab spring in January 2011. Following the revolution, he organized the first election process in Egyptian universities to choose his successor as Dean of the Faculty in March 2011, as he left the country on 15 May 2011 in the capacity of cultural counselor at the Egyptian Embassy to Berlin and head of the educational mission there. In this post, he supervised all Egyptian students in Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway.

The Jewish community of Oldenburg in northwest Germany was established as early as the 14th century. It existed consecutively ever since, except for occasion deportations by the local rulers of the Duchy of Oldenburg and the Holocaust, which annihilated the majority of Jews left in the city in the 1930s. Nevertheless, after the Holocaust, Jewish survivors have returned and resettled in the Oldenburg Jewish community, which nowadays operates actively within the Central Council of Jews in Germany, the fastest growing Jewish community in the world. History =14th century= The first evidence of Jews in Oldenburg is a documentation of the words \\"Reuben, the son of R. Jeremiah - may his memory be blessed\\", on a bronze seal-ring, found in the immediate neighborhood in Oldenburg. In 1334, the city council stopped issuing protection decrees to the town Jews, making them vulnerable to strangers and outsiders. Afterwards, Jews continued to live in Oldenburg under the protection of the duke, although he restricted their economic activities. On 1345, the Jews in Oldenburg were deprived of any kind of trade except for money lending. Though the Jews of the nearby village of Wildeshausen were expelled, there is no evidence of the expulsion of the Oldenburg community during that time. =15th to 18th centuries= Between 1667 and 1773 Denmark ruled the Oldenburg area. During that time, Jews began settling in the city once again, in the encouragement of the Danes. A Jewish family called Goldschmidt settled in town and worked in the selling and trading meat, though only the grandson - Joseph Baruch Goldschmidt succeed in growing the business to be clearly profitable, earning him and his sons letters of protection in Oldenburg. =19th century= 27 Jews were living in Oldenburg in 1807, approximately 0.6% of the total 4,692 residents living in Oldenburg at that time, and the amount of the community grew steadily over the next decades, though its percentage always stood at around 1% of the total population. By 1820 the community numbered 80 (1.2%), and 104 in 1855 (0.9%). The number continued to grow into 169 in 1875 (0.9%) until it reached 265 individuals in 1905. During the century, several buildings and other services were established for the community, including a synagogue, a school and a hired teacher, which was also the cantor and the schochet. Young Nathan Marcus Adler (1803-1890), first Landrabbiner of Oldenburg In 1808, the Duchy was the last part of the west-of-the-Rein Napoleon conquered territories that insisted that the Jews will adopt fixed names upon themselves. These names became popular among the region Jews as happened with all Ashkenazi Jews and are the ones popular nowadays among Ashkenazi Jews worldwide.Lars Menk: A Dictionary of German-Jewish Surnames. Avotaynu, Bergenfield, 2005. pp. 3-4 As part of the general Jewish emancipation process in Europe, Oldenburg, which was part of the North German Confederation emancipation the town Jews in 1869. As a result, many Jews started to open business in different professions, some of them were successful, such as women textile and leather stores H. Wall Heimer and L. Stein Thal, court banker Carl Ballin and his brother pharmacist DR. George Ballin; purveyors Hahlo and his brother Leopold Wilhelm, and Paul and Franz Reiersbach who manufactured bicycles and musical instruments under the company name ML Reyersbach AG. Oldenburg's first Landrabbiner (chief local rabbi) was Nathan Marcus Adler, who received his PhD in Philosophy in 1823 and was asked to fulfill the seat. After he left Oldenburg, he became the chief Rabbi of the British Empire and one of the most influential orthodox Jews. His house was used as the town synagogue before a building was rented for this purpose years afterGeschichte der Stadt Oldenburg. Band I. S. 551 =20th century= During the World War I several Jews from Oldenburg and nearby towns were killed in the battles. Plaques commemorating their names was placed in the local synagogue.http://www.alemannia- judaica.de/images/Images%20325/Oldenburg%20Israelit%2018051915.jpg In 1924, the local central office for the Jewish welfare was established, helping members of the community in need. Shortly after, another charity fund was founded under the name Gemilus Chassodim. In addition, a Jewish youth organization and Maccabi sports club branch were active in town, as well as the Israelite Women's association.\\"Israelite Women‚Äôs Association\\" An archived news article published on January 14, 1932 in \\"The Israelite\\" newspaper depicts an antisemitic incident, as the outer walls of the synagogue were stained in anti-semitic symbols.archived news article, The Israelite, January 14, 1932 In 1933, 279 Jews lived in Oldenburg. Following that years Nazi victory in elections, the Oldenburg community, as many other Jews in Germany, began to decline. A few Jewish businessmen closed their shops in 1933. Adolf de Beer,A street was named after him in Etzhorn, nearby Oldenburg an owner of a large laundry business with branches also outside the city, closed his business in August 1936. Kristallnacht The town synagogue was destroyed during 1938 Kristallnacht as well as the last two Jewish stores which remained open on Kurwickstrasse. Most Jewish men were arrested and sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp for a number weeks. Among those sent to Sachsenhausen was also Rabbi Leo Trepp, the last surviving Rabbi who led a community during the Holocaust. During that time he was in charge of 15 synagogues in the area of Oldenburg. As Jews were forbidden to attend the public schools, he got permission to establish a school in the synagogue building in the purpose of educating Jewish boys. Trepp recalled being in Sachsenhausen for 18 daysDirector filmmaker Christian Walther made a documentary about Trepp called \\"Der Letzte Rabbiner\\" Trepp is an honorary citizen of the city of Oldenburg. Another resident, Henry Hirschberg recalled: \\"... There were two SA men in the apartment, they were calling on the stairs loudly, police! Police! ... \\" \\"... about 40 men were led past the still burning synagogue on November 10. From there we went through the busy shopping streets - such as Haarenstra√üe, Lange Stra√üe, Schlo√üplatz and others - to prison. Mob stood everywhere around... \\" \\"... school boys who apparently had no school because of Kristallnacht made fun of us\\". Since 1981 an annual commemoration walk (Erinnerungsgang) has been held by Oldenburg citizens in memory of the deportation of the Oldenburg Jews on November 10, 1938. Holocaust By 1939 only 96 Jews were left in Oldenburg, of which 20 were forcibly living in a single in Kurwickstrasse 5. Of the Jews who lived in Oldenburg in 1933, 62 emigrated to the Netherlands, 17 to Palestine (the British Mandate), 36 to the United States or Canada and others to the United Kingdom and South Africa. Some of them did not survive the Holocaust, as do most of these who remained in town. After the Holocaust and 21st century Alina Treiger, the Oldenburg congregation rabbi since 2010 After World War II had ended, about 23 Jewish survivors returned to Oldenburg and re-established a small Jewish community. A small prayer room was opened in 1948 on C√§cilienstrasse 9, but the community diminished to only four individuals towards the end of the 1960s, until it dissolved in the end of January 1971. During the 1990s, with immigration of the former USSR Jews to Germany, about 34 Jewish immigrants established a new community in Oldenburg and in 2013 the Jewish community of Oldenburg numbered 315, about as much was in the city before the Holocaust. During the second part of the 1990s, the rabbi of the congregation was Bea Wyler, the first female Rabbi in Germany to officiate a congregation. Nowadays, the congregation rabbi is Alina Treiger. =Places= Synagogue The present synagogue in the Baptist church building Though a Jewish congregation had existed in Oldenburg long before the 19th century, the first synagogue was officially opened only on June 6, 1829, in a rented house on M√ºhlenstra√üe 5. The foundation stone for a new synagogue on Peter Street number 6 was laid on May 3, 1854 and its inauguration on August 24, 1855. Archived articles from the Allgemeine Zeitung des JudentumsArchived articles from the Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums and the Israelits newspaper depict the opening of the newer synagogue.Israelits newspaper In 1904/5 the synagogue was expanded and a new Mikveh was also established. The synagogue was burnt down by the Nazis during Kristallnacht in 1938. Between 1949 and 1950 the arsonists of the synagogue were tried and were sentenced to periods between nine months to two years. In 1967, a memorial stone was put in the side of the former synagogue building and another one, commemorating the victims of the Nazi regime, was put aside the first stone in 1990. On March 5, 1995, a new synagogue was opened in the building of a former Baptist chapel, on Wilhelmstrasse 15-17 (later renamed as Leo-Trepp-Stra√üe). Cemetery The Jewish community of Oldenburg acquired its own cemetery in 1814 at Ostenburg, which was then a rural suburb of Oldenburg, and the first burial was also held that year. Before 1814, the Jewish community in the city buried its deceased in nearby Varel. The cemetery was used not only by the Jews of Oldenburg but also by those of the nearby Elsfleth, Zwischenahn and Wardenburg. The cemetery was enlarged in 1862, and a wall was built around him a few years later. After his son died on 1918, merchant Leo Trommer built a funeral home at the cemetery commemorating his name. The funeral house was unsuccessfully set on fire on Kristallnacht, though its inventory was burned. Oldenburg Jewish cemetery Among those buried in the cemetery are , who served as the community chief Rabbi between 1841‚Äì1874, and , who served as the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg chief Rabbi at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Rabbi Bernhard Wechsler and his wife Adelaide gravestone During World War II, 54 Russian war prisoners were buried in a mass grave in the cemetery area. A memorial stone was put in their honor in 1950. During the years of the war, a small round bunker was built in the cemetery. Over the years, the synagogue was desecrated a number of times by antisemites. On May 28, 1935, a number of gravestones were overturned and smashed.Article from 1935 documenting the incident in \\"The Israelite\\" German Jewish newspaper On 1938 Kristallnacht, the cemetery was unsuccessfully set on fire. The people who conducted the attack were sentenced in 1949 to a period of six months to one year in jail. On November 19, 2011, six gravestones in the cemetery were painted in white in what appears to be an anti-semitic act. One of the men in charge of the desecration was caught and sentenced to two years suspended sentence. On November 24, 2013, the cemetery was once again desecrated, and swastikas were painted on eight gravestones. In addition, the funeral house was also painted with the word \\"Jew\\" and other swastikas. The cemetery stopped conducting burials in 2000, and another Jewish cemetery was opened about 5.5 km from the city center in the district B√ºmmerstede, Sandkruger Street, 26133 Oldenburg.photos on http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/oldenburg_friedhof_neu.htm Leo Trepp Beth Midrash The Beth midrash (study house) is a gathering place for the local Jewish community in which lectures and lessons are being taught at a daily basis, such as \\"Jewish women\\", \\"The use of field Rabbis during WWI\\" and others.

The Raja of Parlakimedi decided to connect his capital with Naupada which was only 40 km away. With the government giving its sanction in 1898, work began in full. The line was opened to traffic in 1900. This railway line was built at a cost of Rs 700,000. In the starting years, the Parlakhimidi Railway had incurred losses but after 1910, it started making marginal profits and after 1924-25, the profits increased. This motivated the Raja to extend the line to Gunupur in two phases in 1929 and 1931. It was later merged with Bengal Nagpur Railway. The narrow gauge line was converted to broad gauge in the year 2011. Railway reorganization After Indian Independence it was merged with North Eastern Railway. surveys were undertaken for broad gauge conversion in 1950 and again in 1964 and 1967.

Early life Ay≈üe Sultan was born on 31 October 1887 in the Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace. Her father was Sultan Abdul Hamid II, and her mother was M√º≈üfika Kadƒ±n, the daughter of Gazi Aƒüƒ±r Mahmud Bey and Emine Hanƒ±m. She was the tenth child and sixth daughter born to his father, but the only child of her mother. She was the granddaughter of Sultan Abdulmejid I and Tirim√ºjgan Kadƒ±n. Ay≈üe's education took place in a study room in the Lesser Chancellery of the Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace, together with her elder sister ≈ûadiye Sultan. Their instructors were the privy secretary Hasib Efendi and the Private Enciphering Secretary K√¢mil Efendi. Hasib Efendi would give lessons in the Quran, Arabic, and Persian, while K√¢mil Efendi was to teach Turkish reading and writing, Ottoman grammar, arithmetic, history, and geography. Ay≈üe took her piano lessons from the hazinedar D√ºrr√ºyekta (who later became the wife of her eldest brother ≈ûehzade Mehmed Selim). She was herself the student of Fran√ßois Lombardi, who had been hired as instructor to the Imperial Corps of Music and from whom Ay≈üe also took lessons once a week. First marriage =Engagement= Ay≈üe Sultan was bethrothed to Ahmed Nami Bey, son of Fahri Bey, in 1908 during the last year of her father's reign. However, at the overthrew of her father in 1909, the princess followed her parents into exile at Thessaloniki. The next year she returned to Istanbul. =Wedding= The marriage took place in June 1910 in the Dolmabah√ße Palace, together with her sisters, ≈ûadiye Sultan and Refia Sultan. The marriage ceremony was performed by ≈ûeyh√ºlislam Musa Kazƒ±m Efendi. The wedding reception took place two months later on 9 August 1910 in the Bebek Palace. =Issue= The couple's first child, a son, Sultanzade √ñmer Nami Bey was born on 4 November 1911 in the Bebek Palace. He was followed by Aliye Namiye Hanƒ±msultan born on 7 February 1913, who died at the age of two months on 9 April 1913. Before her father's death, Ay≈üe went to Switzerland, where the couple's third child, a son, Sultanzade Osman Nami Bey was born on 13 January 1918 in Geneva. Divorce and second Marriage Ay≈üe Sultan and her husband divorced in 1921. After her divorce, she married Yarbay Mehmed Ali Bey, son of Rauf Pasha on 3 April 1921 in the Ni≈üanta≈üƒ± Palace. The two together had one son, Sultanzade Abdul Hamid Rauf Bey born in 1921. At the exile of the imperial family in March 1924, Ay≈üe, her husband and children settled in Paris. She was widowed at her husband's death in 1937. Her mother, on the other hand, chose to remain in Turkey, so that the two did not see one another for some 28 years, until the princess's return from exile in 1952. Memoirs Ay≈üe Sultan wrote her memoir in Istanbul after her return from exile, completing it by 1955. Ay≈üe, for large portions of the memoir she relied on the memory of her mother, as the two lived together the princess's return to Turkey. The work originally appeared in the serial format in the Turkish popular magazine Hayat in the late 1950s, followed by its publication as a book in Istanbul in 1960, shortly before the princess's death. The fact that the memoir was written as a magazine serial accounts for its format. At its publication, the major attraction of the book lay in the princess's recollections of her famous parent. Recognizing this, she titled her memoir Babam Sultan Abd√ºlhamid (Turkish for \\"My Father, Sultan Abdul Hamid\\"). In it she crafted a personal view of Abdul Hamid the man the father, a kind of personal vindication to counteract what she saw as the distorted public image of the controversial ruler whose 33-year reign ended in dethronement and vilification. Death Ay≈üe Sultan died on 10 August 1960 at the Serencebey Yoku≈üu, at the age of 72, and was buried in the imperial mausoleum at the Yahya Efendi dervish convent, adjacent to Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace.

Its lineup emerged from an acoustic trio, Rosewood, which originally included Geoff Chunn, who later joined Split Enz. Despite making only sporadic live appearances‚Äîone of which was a double billing shared with Split Enz‚Äîtheir singles gained major airplay on Auckland radio and the Waves album reached No.7 on the New Zealand album charts, later becoming a sought-after collector's item. In 1976 the band recorded a second album that was rejected by their record company, which later erased the tapes. Dejected, the band split up in September 1977. A surviving rough mix of the second album was released in 2013 as Misfit, a bonus disc with the first official CD release of Waves. A co-founder of the band, Graeme Gash, released a solo album, After the Carnival, in 1981. Waves reformed in 2013 for a record store performance in Auckland and announced they were writing songs for a further album. History In the early 1970s Auckland Technical Institute art and design students Graeme Gash and Kevin Wildman formed Rosewood, an acoustic folk-pop trio, with Geoff Chunn, gigging regularly at an Auckand venue and also at the 1973 Ngaruawahia Music Festival. Rosewood disbanded when Chunn left in April 1973 to join Split Enz as drummer. Gash and Wildman continued to meet to play guitar and work on their vocal harmonies, mixing with other Auckland musicians at the Parnell Rd home of Geoff and Mike Chunn. Gash recalled: \\"One day David Marshall crashed our jam; we were gobsmacked. He was great. We snapped him up. Michael Matthew was hanging out with a bunch of musos we knew, and we cajoled him into accompanying us on the bashwalk to glory.\\" Adopting the name Waves, the band‚Äîwith Gash, Wildman and Marshall on guitar and Matthew on bass‚Äîplayed at folk clubs, cafes and eventually at Auckland Town Hall, His Majesty's Theatre, the Maidment and the Mercury, playing soft rock and singing four-part harmonies. They avoided the pub circuit, as Gash explained: \\"They wanted something to drink to, not think to. So we needed venues where the intricacies of our music would be heard.\\" The band had three writers, with each member excelling at singing or guitar- playing. Gash said the band felt proud playing original New Zealand songs. \\"Back then it wasn't particularly popular to front up and play all your own music. People tended to get a little bored with that.\\" With continued performances, the band sensed a building excitement and air of anticipation. \\"Split Enz had embedded themselves into the national psyche, or at least the leading edge of it,\\" Gash said. \\"Hot Licks was championing a lot of local work. Radio stations like Hauraki were into doing their bit for the locals as well. Hauraki were great in those days; they used to do Buck-a-Head concerts. Big venue, one dollar for two bands.\\" Waves album In 1975 Roger Jarrett, the editor of local music magazine Hot Licks, introduced the band to Kerry Thomas and Guy Morris, co-owners of the magazine and Direction Records, a retail chain and independent record label. On 7 July 1975 the band began a five-day recording session for their debut album at Stebbing Studios in Jervois Rd, Ponsonby, across the road from the eight-bedroom colonial villa where Waves members lived. Gash recalled: \\"Before walking through the front door of Stebbings, we‚Äôd prepared, done a lot of practice and a lot of live work with the material, so we knew it back to front. Let‚Äôs face it, we‚Äôd been living across the road getting ourselves ready for this moment for about a year.\\" Thomas arranged expatriate New Zealand producer Peter Dawkins, then living in Sydney, to return to Auckland to produce the album. Gash said: \\"Dawkins had five days, and he marshalled us through the procedures in a most efficient fashion. That was his job, and he did it well. He was tough though: one of our friends wasn‚Äôt cutting it quickly enough with his solo, and Peter made me go into the studio and fire him on the spot. We freely availed ourselves of notable contributors. Some‚ÄîMike Chunn, Mike Caen, Roy Mason‚Äîwere personal friends; others‚ÄîVic Williams, Murray Grindlay, Mike Harvey, Paul Lee‚Äîwere introduced to us in the studio.\\" He told The New Zealand Herald: \\"We were in a world we had dreamed of being in. It was a mix of excitement and terror.\\" At the end of the week, Dawkins flew back to Sydney with the finished tapes to mix them. \\"No doubt, in his world this was standard procedure,\\" Gash said. \\"However what it did was disengage us from the process. When the mixes came back to Auckland, we didn‚Äôt understand them. They were not the way we heard ourselves. We voiced our desire to remix the album. Almost miraculously, Kerry Thomas agreed, and gained my gratitude forever. We kept Peter‚Äôs mixes of \\"Waterlady Song\\" and \\"Arrow\\"; the rest the band remixed at Stebbing's with (engineer) Phil Yule, and that is what appeared on the album.\\" The album was released in October 1975, reached No.7 on the album charts and became one of the best-selling albums by New Zealand artists of the 1970s. Three singles were released‚Äî\\"The Dolphin Song\\"/\\"Letters\\", \\"Arrow\\"/Clock House Shuffle\\" and \\"At the Beach\\"/Waitress\\". Follow-up and breakup The success of Waves attracted the attention of major record labels and in 1976 the band‚Äînow with a drummer, Rex Carter, and new bassist Michael Mason, who replaced Michael Matthew‚Äîentered Mandrill Studios in Parnell to record their second album for WEA Records. Some of the songs followed the folk-rock style of the debut album, while on others the band began to explore a new direction with electric guitars. Gash said: \\"We were producing it ourselves, and it was all ourselves; unlike the first album, there were no guest performances. The rhythm section was jelling nicely, the songs and the playing seemed a step up and we felt much more relaxed and in control of the process than we had previously. Things were looking pretty good.\\" But with just a few solo overdubs to complete and on the verge of mixing, the band was told that label boss Tim Murdoch didn't like what they had done and had ordered that the multi-track tapes should be recorded over. Studio boss Dave Hurley allowed the band to copy a rough mix of the tapes before it was wiped. \\"That is the only record we have of our endeavours, an entire album‚Äôs worth of work,\\" Gash told NZ Musician magazine. \\"We had worked hard. It deserved better. Maybe we just weren‚Äôt tough enough; certainly, after a few good blows to the head you start to wonder what it‚Äôs all for. The second album being wiped just prior to the mix broke our hearts.\\" In July 1977 the band recorded one last song, \\"Vegas\\", at Mascot Studios and delivered it to Murdoch. \\"It was some of our best playing,\\" Gash said. \\"Almost unbelievably, the plug was once again pulled just prior to mixing.\\"Graeme Gash, liner notes to Waves reissue, January 2013. In 1981 Gash produced a solo album, After the Carnival, while Marshall became a member of Lip Service in 1980 and Martial Law in 1984. 2013 revival The band reformed in 2003 for a one-off gig at the St James Theatre in a lineup that included Dave Dobbyn, Don McGlashan, Anika Moa, Liam Finn and Martin Phillipps. In 2012 the band was contacted by Roger Marbeck of Ode Records and music enthusiast and archivist Grant Gillanders to reissue the 1975 Waves album‚Äîby then a collectors' item fetching high prices‚Äîon CD and vinyl for Record Store Day in April, with the release launched by a live performance at the Real Groovy record store in Auckland. Neither Marbeck nor Gillanders was aware a second album also existed, albeit in a rudimentary form and decided to re-release them both as a double CD. \\"I think it was the idea of getting that out of the shadows and into the light that swung the deal for me,\\" Gash said. As planning began, it was discovered the original master tapes for the Waves album had vanished with the collapse in the 1970s of Direction Records. \\"It came down to the small number of unplayed vinyls I had stashed away under the bed for the last 38 years,\\" Gash said. \\"They were old, but mint, and I took them to Stebbings, where we ran them on a very high-end turntable and transferred it all to digital files. It worked superbly. We then mastered it there for vinyl with Steve McGough, pulling in the original engineer, Phil Yule, to listen as well. I then redid all the cover art and designed a new insert for photos and info, Kevin did a take on the original Direction label, and we sent it all off for cutting, pressing and packaging to United Record Pressing in Nashville.\\" He said: \\"It actually sounds good, if not better, than the original.\\" For the previously unreleased 1976 album, McGough also took the single tape that existed of the unmixed recordings and transferred it to digital, while Marbeck succeeded in locating the multi-track tapes of \\"Vegas\\", the final song Waves recorded. Gash said: \\"They are the only multi-tracks we have of any of our material, and therefore the only song we had the opportunity to do an actual mix on. And so, we have 'Vegas', recorded July 1977, mixed January 2013. We had to bake the tape at Stebbings prior to running it, but we retrieved everything. We then took those files to York St Studios in Parnell, where we mixed 'Vegas' with engineer Hayden Taylor and mastered the Mandrill sessions. I would have loved to have mixed them as well, but with the multi-tracks destroyed back in 1976, that was not an option.\\" The end result was the Waves album, remastered for both vinyl and CD, plus a bonus disc, Misfit, containing nine of the original 12 songs of the previously unheard second album. Five hundred copies of the vinyl album were pressed and 1000 copies of the double CD package. The band played at Real Groovy and signed copies of the new releases. Gash said: \\"We started rehearsing every weekend and working it back up. But it was lovely because people had come from all over the place to see us. Most of them were old, but not all of them. Some came up clutching their original Waves album, but then some of them also bought the new vinyl. Some we had to sign both, and some came up with After the Carnival. There was a flurry of doing interviews, stuff which I hadn't thought about for decades. It was exhausting but interesting. We were amazed at where the fans were: this radio programmer still had the T-shirts, that television producer wanted us to do the show because he was a massive fan. We were amazed at the level of interest and didn't expect it.\\" The band announced they were rehearsing and writing again for a new Waves album. Gash said: \\"I'm very conscious it's very hard to beat the old songs that people will love. You tend to disappoint people with your follow-up stuff, but having said that I think what we are doing now is better. It is just as song-based so it's not like it's gone somewhere else, but as songs there is some really strong material there. \\"Kevin Wildman‚Äîwho really only managed to put a stake in the ground twice, but they were spectacular songs‚Äîis now spinning them out practically one a week and there are some gems. So he has prompted me and David (Marshall) to try harder because we can't let them get away with that. It's always been a band with three writers.\\" Discography =Albums= * Waves (Direction, 1975) * Waves /Misfit (remastered) (Ode, 2013) =Singles= *\\"The Dolphin Song\\"/\\"Letters\\" (Direction, 1975) *\\"Arrow\\"/Clock House Shuffle\\" (Direction, 1975) *\\"At the Beach\\"/Waitress\\" (Direction, 1975) References Category:New Zealand rock music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1974 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1977 ","title":"Waves (band)"},{"id":"43078068","text":"Sabine Thalbach (1932‚Äì1966) was a German actress who appeared in many East German films.

In this respect it is a belated balancing feature for the German Wine Gate, 85 kilometers (53 miles) to the south which has marked the southern end of the German Wine Route at Schweigen since 1936. Apart from its unusual architecture and its position at the end of the German Wine Route, its most obvious feature is a large restaurant, much of which is built out over the road that previously divided Gro√übockenheim from Kleinbockenheim.  Geography  The Haus der Deutschen Weinstra√üe was built between and , two municipalities which were administratively independent until 1956 when they were officially merged as part of a local government boundary reform. The eastern wing of the building is in effect a bridge over (Local Road 271). The Haus der Deutschen Weinstra√üe is positioned very close to several social and cultural amenities including the Bockenheim show ground, a sports ground and a community centre.  The Building  The building's architecture incorporates conscious echoes of a Roman castra (fortification). The visible parts of it are predominantly of timber construction, and the supporting entablature is partially exposed. In addition to a 120 seat restaurant, the building has several meeting rooms available. A showpiece is the Turmzimmer (\\"Tower Room\\") at the top which offers views over the local vineyards and towards the Haardt Mountains beyond. The restaurant opens on to a terrace which is set by the side of a lake which has been created on the site of a pond/wetland area..

He finished his studies at the Hungarian University of Fine Arts in Budapest, and later he learnt at Wien and Berlin as well. As a result of the fascist ideas in the German speaking countries, he moved to Paris and later to London, where he taught sculpture studies. His brother, M√°rk invited him to the Union of South Africa. He went there and settled in Johannesburg. He founded here an artist studio. He married in 1942 with Vera Rosenbaum, and they had three children (Michael, Pamela, Louis). He served in the Army during World War II. He took a half year trip to Israel, Rome, Paris and New York in 1952.

In April 2010, at the age of 17, Siddiqi was killed in his family's home in the Roath area of Cardiff. On 1 February 2013 Jason Richards, 38, and Ben Hope, 39, were convicted of his murder; they had intended to kill a different man. Later that month they were both sentenced to life imprisonment, and ordered to serve a minimum of 40 years. Background Aamir Siddiqi was born in 1993 to Iqbal Siddiqi, a retired civil servant, and his wife Parveen. In April 2010 they were living at 110 Ninian Road, Cardiff. At around the same time Jason Richards ran a car garage in Cardiff. A man with a history of drug dependence, Richards had several previous convictions for violent offences including robbery and blackmail. He led what was described as a \\"chaotic and violent\\" lifestyle and had spent periods in prison. In one incident in 1996, Richards attacked an off-duty police officer and another man in Cardiff city centre. Both men were badly injured with one suffering a skull fracture, and Richards was sentenced to 27 months imprisonment for grievous bodily harm. In another incident, Richards was imprisoned for 18 months for actual bodily harm following an attack on his wife in 2004. Richards met Ben Hope, who also had a history of violence and drug problems, whilst incarcerated. The two developed a friendship which continued after their release. In 2010 they were approached by a local businessman who proposed they carry out the killing of a man with whom he had been in a property dispute, for ¬£1,000. Attack On the afternoon of Sunday 11 April 2010, Richards and Hope went to the Siddiqis' home on Ninian Road. Both had been using drugs. Hearing the two men knock, and expecting a visit from his imam for a Koran lesson, Aamir ran to open the front door, where he was confronted by the two men on the doorstep. They immediately attacked Siddiqi, stabbing him multiple times in the neck and chest. Siddiqi attempted to escape by running back into the house but Richards and Hope pursued him, continuing the assault. Siddiqi's parents attempted to intervene and were also stabbed. The men left the house shortly afterwards and Siddiqi's parents called the police. On their arrival it was clear that Siddiqi was gravely injured. The address is about half a mile from the University Hospital of Wales but there was a 20-minute delay in the arrival of an ambulance, during which time the police officers in attendance administered CPR and unsuccessfully attempted to revive Siddiqi. Investigation and trial Both men were arrested days after the attack took place and were tried in late 2012. CCTV footage from around Cardiff was used to trace their movements before and after the attack. Both defendants were linked to a stolen Volvo XC90 which was seen speeding from the scene of the attack ‚Äì traces of Siddiqi's blood were found in the car's footwell, along with Richards' DNA. Hope's fingerprints were found on the steering wheel. Both men blamed the other for the killing During the trial, it emerged that the men had been approached by a local man to carry out a killing over a property dispute. The intended target lived on Shirley Road, adjacent to Ninian Road where the Siddiqis lived. The two defendants went to Ninian road in error, a mistake described as an act of \\"staggering incompetence\\" by the prosecution. Verdict and aftermath On 1 February 2013 Richards and Hope were found guilty of murder at Swansea Crown Court. On 12 February they were both sentenced to life imprisonment, with the judge imposing a minimum terms of 40 years. Members of the Siddiqi family described the sentence as \\"appropriate\\". Richards immediately appealed his conviction, and both men appealed their sentences in January 2014. The appeals were rejected in June 2014. During the investigation a local man named Mohammed Ali Ege emerged as a suspect, potentially as the person responsible for commissioning the crime. He was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder in India in October 2011. He escaped custody whilst using a toilet at a Delhi railway station as Indian authorities were in the process of extraditing him to the UK and has not been seen since.

It is located in Orissa of Gajapati district. History Parlakimedi Light Railway was a two-foot six-inch gauge railway. The Raja of Parlakimedi decided to connect his capital with Naupada which was only 40 km away. With the government giving its sanction in 1898, work began in fully. The line was opened to traffic in 1900. This railway line was built at a cost of Rs 700,000. In the starting years, the Parlakhimidi Railway had incurred losses but after 1910, it started making marginal profits and after 1924-25, the profitsincreased. This motivated the Raja to extend the line to Gunupur in two phases in 1929 and 1931. It was later merged with Bengal Nagpur Railway. Railway reorganization After Indian Independence it was merged with North Eastern Railway. surveys were undertaken for broad gauge conversion in 1950 and again in 1964 and 1967. The foundation stone was finally laid for the Naupada-Gunupur gauge conversion work at Naupada on 27 September 2002. With effect from 1 April 2003 it became a part of the newly formed East Coast Railway. The line was finally closed for gauge conversion on 9 June 2004. Services were restarted on 22 August 2011 with the introduction of Puri- Gunupur Passenger.

It was named by the British explorer, Matthew Flinders, on 23 March 1802. Description Kangaroo Head is the north-west tip of Dudley Peninsula on Kangaroo Island and overlooks Nepean Bay to the west, Investigator Strait to the north and Backstairs Passage to the east. It is the termination for a pair of coastlines - one extending from Cape Willoughby in the east via Backstairs Passage and the other extending from Strawbridge Point in the south via Nepean Bay. It is described as ‚Äòa bluff, rocky point marked by a conspicuous white cairn‚Äô where the land behind ‚Äòrises steeply to heights of to ‚Äô. Since 2002, it has been located within the gazetted locality of Kangaroo Head. Formation, geology & oceanography  Kangaroo Head was formed when the sea reached its present level 7,500 years ago after sea levels started to rise at the start of the Holocene. The cliff line which includes Kangaroo Head consists of a grey metasandstone belonging to the Kanmantoo group bedrock known as the Tananappa Formation. The water adjoining Kangaroo Head drops to a depth of at the base of its cliff face. History =Aboriginal use= As of 1999, the literature had not cited any archaeological discoveries specific to Aboriginal use of land in the immediate vicinity of Kangaroo Head. =European discovery= Kangaroo Head was discovered and named by Matthew Flinders on 23 March 1802. This place was where Flinders first sighted Mount Lofty, the tallest peak in the Mount Lofty Ranges. Economic activity As of 2014, the land adjoining Kangaroo Head is used for farming. Farming activity at the locality had been underway prior to 1945 when most of the land had been reported as being cleared of native vegetation.

Family and Early Career Born on 26 December 1756, he was the third son of Miles Barne of Sotterley, Suffolk, and his second wife, Mary Thornhill, a daughter of George Thornhill of Diddington, Huntingdonshire.Stokes (1986) He was educated at Westminster School and then matriculated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1776, gaining LL.B. in 1781 and then becoming a fellow in 1786. He was admitted at the Inner Temple on 11 June 1773 and then migrated to the Middle Temple at that date in 1782, having been called to the Bar in 1781, from which time he began practising on the Western circuit. He later became a Bencher of the Inner Temple, in 1816. Member of Parliament In 1796, the ill health of his eldest brother, Miles Barne, who was already quite reluctant to be a member, left the family seat of Dunwich vacant (Dunwich was a notorious \\"Rotten Borough\\" and remained in the pocket of the Barne family from 1764 until the Great Reform Act). Given that the elder brother, Barne Barne, had been appointed Commissioner of Taxes in 1791, it fell upon Snowdon Barne, who had not been \\"making that progress in his profession which ‚Ä¶ might have been expected\\",The Gentleman's Magazine (1825, pt. ii), p. 89 to take over the seat. He gave silent support to Pitt the Younger's administration, but tended to oppose Addington's, voting with the opposition on the defence questions that brought down that ministry in 1804. He continued to support Pitt when he became Prime Minister after Addingtion's defeat; he voted against censuring Lord Melville in 1805 and sat on a Committee to investigate the Eleventh Naval Report, both acts allowing him to obtain a reward for his service from Pitt, who had him appointed Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer in 1806. He declined the offer from Spencer Perceval to be Secretary to the Treasury, citing the workload, but was made one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury in 1809 and being reappointed each year thereafter until 1812;Sainty (1972) during that time, he voted in favour of the Government, making clear his desire for a place on the Custom Board. His support in several Bills during 1811 and 1812 saw this realised and he was appointed to that Board in 1812.

This project involved a photocatalytic composite made up of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, hollow glass microspheres, and Portland cement. In 2012 Kurup's photocatalytic composite was able to reduce the amount of total coliform from 8000 colony- forming units to 50. In addition, it oxidised Methylene blue at a faster rate than standard solar disinfection methods. She improved her method and after 3 years developed a pervious photocatalytic composite using sand, TiO2, Portland cement and silver nitrate. This photocatalytic pervious composite showed 98% reduction in total coliform bacteria immediately after filtration. Exposure of the filtered water to sunlight with a photocatalytic composite disc resulted in 100% inactivation of total coliform bacteria in just 15 minutes.

Dhayalan (Balaji Venugopal), Albert's agent, uses a taxi belonging to Panneer (Karunakaran) to travel all over Chennai, his motive being to confuse the police by constantly travelling and confusing the GPS locators. Dhayalan and Panneer bond and swap life stories. Panneer drops Dhayalan at his hotel and is asked to return the following morning. When Panneer goes to Dhayalan's room the following morning, he saw Dhayalan dead with a knife in his chest. This brings Inspector Bhoominathan (Bobby Simha) and his sidekick Constable Mariadas (Chetan), who arrest Panneer as a suspect for murdering Dhayalan. However, Panneer is whisked away by a film producer (Aadukalam Naren), who comes in the guise of a Maharashtra Police Officer. He wants Panneer, who is the last person to have seen Dhayalan alive, because he wants to place a bet on the match to win big and pay off a producer (Radha Ravi) to whom he owes several crores. Eventually, the police sets a trap for Albert with Panneer playing a major role, but the plot turns awry when Albert manages to get away with it and with Panneer winning two crores from his bet, which he uses to set up his own call taxi company, and his wife Rama (Vijayalakshmi), who sets up her own restaurant.

The audio launch event was held at Sathyam Cinemas in Chennai on 1 September 2014, where the makers unveiled the film's soundtrack and theatrical trailer of the film. The soundtrack received positive reviews. Behindwoods gave a rating of 2.5 out of 5 to the album stating, \\"Sean Roldon continues his approach to bring new sounds to Tamil film songs. But Aadama Jaichomada songs will need the visuals to be evaluated better.\\" Indiaglitz gave a rating of 3 out of 5 to the soundtrack. Reception = Critical reception = The film received overall positive reviews. The Times of India gave the film 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"There is scope for an interesting black comedy in this plot but Aadama Jaichomada often feels less quirky and less funny than it should have been. It is as if the makers decided to stick to the lowest possible yardstick and were satisfied for managing to cross it. As a result, many of the jokes do not work that well...We are amused..we smile...we chuckle...but we never truly laugh non-stop\\". The New Indian Express wrote, \\"Laced with dark humour, Aadama Jaichomada keeps one entertained for the most part. Taking just about two hours of viewing time, Aadama Jaichomada has its good moments and is a breezy watch\\". Rediff gave 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"The characters and the situation they unwittingly get themselves into, is well thought out, and cleverly woven into the screenplay. The narrative too is totally unpredictable, keeping you guessing. At just two hours, the story moves at a brisk pace\\", going on to add that the film \\"does work as an entertainer\\". Sify wrote, \\"The film works for its performances of Karunakaran, Balaji and the interactions between the bumbling cops Simhaa, KS Ravikumar and Chetan. There is something quirky about it that makes the film a watchable fun ride. Aadama Jaichomada is like a T:20 match fast and thoroughly enjoyable\\". IANS gave 3 stars and wrote, \\"Aadama Jaichomada, at two hours, attempts to be a crime- thriller as well as a sports-based comedy. But it only succeeds as the latter, and fails to do justice to the former form...Despite a weak story, the humour in Aadama Jaichomada will bowl over the movie buffs\\". The Hindu wrote, \\"Picture yourself reading an average joke book. You flip page after page, reading the jokes, many of which barely evoke a smile. Just as you decide to try one last one before flinging the book away, you find a tickler that gets you laughing. Aadama Jaichomada is this joke book that surprises you with a witty line or funny joke just when you are resigned to expecting nothing\\". Cinemalead rated a 2.5 out of 5 and wrote,\\"Short and Fun\\" =Box office= The film opened to good response and collected 4 crore (Share) in its first week end. The film collected 10.22 crore (Share) worldwide at the box office.

She began her music career as a member of Iluminada, is the founder of the electronic rock band Zigmat, and collaborated in Pacha Massive before forming her own solo project in 2012.  Early life  Lionheart's early education began with piano lessons starting at the age of 5, while a large portion of her childhood was spent traveling from Spain to Puerto Rico. It was then that she began learning about songwriting and improvisation. Her father's eventual work transfer led Lionheart to San Antonio, Texas where she would spend her teenage years learning the flute and acoustic guitar. Later, while still in San Antonio, she attended Douglas Mac Arthur High School and played in their jazz and marching band, as well as singing in her school and church choirs. However, it was not until she got accepted into her high school's advanced music theory class where she would finally begin to make her mark as a successful musician. She went to win the award for Best Original Composition, which led her to collaborate with the San Antonio Symphony's resident composer, Robert Xavier Rodr√≠guez.  College years and iluminada  Lionheart attended the Berklee College of Music, where she received the Berklee Entering Student Talent Scholarship and the Ford Salute to Education Academic Award. There she majored in education and performed/composed with the electronica group Iluninada, as well as performed in the string and electronic ensemble Ideoplastic. iluminada quickly established themselves as one of the most innovative bands in Boston. Fusing elements of rock, electronic dance music, and trip-hop into a style of their own, the group united a diverse set of musicians whose distinct backgrounds collectively defined the band's sound. During this time, the band released a full-length album entitled The Ethereal Current and soon after, an EP titled, Transparent Walls. The band toured much of the US and England, opening up for acts such as Reel Big Fish and Wishbone Ash. One of iluminada's most memorable shows was at the Middle East Downstairs with Kaki King and St. Vincent (Annie Clark) as openers. After graduating cum laude at Berklee College of Music, she decided to continue her education at New York University where she received the Dean's Academic Scholarship and graduated with a master's degree in Music Technology.  Zigmat  While in New York, Lionheart formed the electronic rock band Zigmat. The band became known as an explosive electro-rock band from New York City. The mixture of electronics, live rock, and Latin dance beats were often compared to the Brazilian Girls, Metric, Daft Punk, and the Yeah Yeah Yeah's. Lionheart's bilingual lyrics, unpredictable light shows, and audience interaction combined and produced an exhilarating and multi-faceted performance. Zigmat began playing around New York City's East Village in clubs such as Piano's and Nublu, garnering a reputation as an unforgettable high-energy outfit. After selling out the well-known Mercury Lounge, they were invited to participate in rock festivals CMJ and LAMC. Their debut self-titled album was released in 2007 and became the first stepping stone for the band in the US. From there, Zigmat (Monica Lionheart) was asked to perform for a television commercial starring Gisele Bundchen. The commercial featured the song \\"So Sure\\". Zigmat was later joined by various top musicians while touring in Mexico, Brazil and the US, in between playing notable venues in New York City. Such sold-out performances were held at venues such as the Canal Room, Highline Ballroom and Joe's Pub. Zigmat has also performed for the LAMC Festival and was chosen as the best emerging artist of LAMC in 2009, also participating at the CMJ festival and SXSW. In May 2009, Zigmat released Sounds of Machines, their second full-length album in the US. The first music video to be featured from that album was \\"Machine.\\" The album consists of nine tracks, each showing a different aspect of Lionheart's vocal agility, which Billboard called ‚Äúthe band‚Äôs secret weapon.‚Äù Four of the tracks deal with the pains, wants and frustrations of love: the album opens with the introspective, electro-ballad \\"Whisper\\" that describes longing and regret, then moves into the attitude of anger and abandonment with the track \\"Decide\\", demanding the lover to ‚Äúshut up‚Äù in both English and Spanish. \\"Light of the Moon\\" paints a dark picture of pseudo-sadistic lust while the track \\"So Sure\\" depicts an unrequited love. Monica uses poetic lyrics in the tracks \\"Watch The World\\", \\"Between Bullets\\", and \\"Fire,\\" each one displaying Lionheart's upper registers with a hushed seraphic quality. \\"Don't Tire\\" is the album's other Span-glish track, and \\"Machine\\" closes out the album with the band's signature haunting riffs. Billboard 's review about the album, ‚Äúthe band‚Äôs debut release blends cultures and enigmatic styles‚Ä¶[and it] kneads in a dash of rock and pop flair and has already inspired comparisons to such established trip-hop acts as Massive Attack, Air and Goldfrapp.‚Äù The Improper Magazine says, ‚Äúthe electronic sounds they make forged with [Lionheart‚Äôs] out-of-this-world vocals and tantalizing effects make Zigmat one extremely arresting and sensual musical concoction.‚Äù Zigmat's music has been featured in the film Backseat (by Bruce Van Dusen) and has garnered local television appearances in New York City (Hit Records Nightlife Videos) and Philadelphia (NBC's The 10! Show) as well as national TV appearances on Fox's Fearless Music TV, Blender and on SiTV in Los Angeles. Radio broadcasts include Batanga Radio, KPFA in Los Angeles, and KCRW's The Morning Becomes Eclectic. Monica Lionheart in 2010 before The Sonar Music Festival in Barcelona In 2009, Zigmat signed with Spanish label Actua Musica and began touring for much of that year, performing at Europe's Sonar Festival held in Barcelona, Spain whose appearances also included Radiohead, Air and Sigur Ros. Broadcasts on Radio Nacional de Espana, Radio 3 and performances at the Circulo de Bellas Artes all ushered Zigmat into the European music circuit, as well as features in Vanity Fair, Blender and Billboard Magazine in American, European and Brazilian editions. ‚ÄúZigmat‚Äôs music is edgy, rockin‚Äô, melodic and dreamy. It's a wonderful fusion that makes for great energy in their recordings and on stage.‚Äù ‚Äî DJ Raul Campos, KCRW  Pacha Massive  In 2010, Lionheart dismantled Zigmat and began working with singer, multi- instrumentalist and producer, Ramon Nova of Pacha Massive. The group released its debut album All Good Things on Nacional Records. Pacha Massive has shared the stage with artists like Morcheeba, Taio Cruz, Ozomatli, Caf√© Tacvba, Los Amigos Invisibles, Aterciopelados, Sidestepper, among many others. MTV Tr3s selected Pacha Massive as the channel's first Descubre and Download artist, featuring the single \\"Don't Let Go\\". They also co-hosted the popular weekly countdown show Mi TRL. Nova approached Lionheart regarding collaboration on Pacha Massive's sophomore release, If You Want It. Lionheart worked with Nova on writing and singing on track \\"Lejos Cerca\\" and sang on the singles \\"If You Want It\\" and \\"Tonight\\".  Solo career  While teaching music at Central Park East elementary school in Harlem, New York. Lionheart performed, composed and collected a body of work whose texture was more organic and mellifluous than the music in previous projects. She spent the summer of 2011 in Santorini, Greece where she completed Indian Summer. In 2012, she made a return to her former label while signing with Latin Alternative music powerhouse, Nacional Records. =Indian Summer= Lionheart's Indian Summer was released on April 14, 2012 by Nacional Records and was well received by critics in the U.S. Produced by Alon Leventon and Lionheart, the songs feature Lionheart's acoustic guitar in straightforward arrangements. Music videos were released for the album's songs \\"Escape Strategy\\", \\"Let Go\\", \\"Rock to Ankles\\" and \\"Relampago\\" which went into MTV and VH1's rotations and received features in Latina Magazine, Remezcla and Billboard Magazine. One of Indian Summers two Spanish tracks, \\"Relampago\\" was used in an episode of the HBO Latino series Capadocia. During this period Lionheart has also worked instrumental music for various commercials, taught, toured and organized music workshops at colleges and universities such as STUK in Belgium, Midi Station, in Brussels and throughout the world with the band Dizzy Ventilators. =\\"The Future\\"= In May 2014, Monica continued her solo career while releasing \\"The Future\\", a playful, one-off single produced by Yusuke Yamamoto and herself. She released a video for the track which was premiered on Concert Blogger on June 10, 2014. There are two remixes of the single, one produced by the Barcelona-based alt- pop band The Pinker Tones and the other by Dj Afro of Los Amigos Invisibles. =Missed Connections= Produced by Steve Wall (Pearl and the Beard) with Dan Molad (of Lucius) and Ryan Alfred (of Calexico), Missed Connections was released January 29, 2016. Time Out Magazine says, \\"Singer-songwriter-multi- instrumentalist Monica Lionheart layers her frosty voice over wafty electropop in a manner that suggests dry ice‚Äîand lots of it‚Äîplus St. Vincent, and early Cure records interpreted by a tropicalia singer. It's gorgeous stuff, in other words.\\" Lionheart recorded duet with artist Gabriel Rios and the strings were written and recorded with Yoed Nir (Regina Spektor, Rufus Wainwright) for the song \\"Ghost\\" the sixth track on the record. \\"Recommended for fans of Goldfrapp, St. Vincent or Portishead, this Brooklyn-based Berklee alum brings a freshness to the electro-pop genre with her distinctive vocals that are both haunting and enchanting,\\" says Paste Magazine.

The Cowbridge Railway was a locally promoted railway line in South Wales, intended to connect the town to the nearby main line network at Llantrisant. The company was desperately short of money to construct the line, and a subscription of ¬£10,000 from the Taff Vale Railway towards the construction costs ensured alignment to that company's system, so that Pontypridd, and not Cardiff, was the destination of through passenger trains. The line opened in 1865 and operated as a through line from Pontypridd in association with the Llantrisant and Taff Vale Junction Railway. The Company was always impoverished and from 1876 leased its line to the Taff Vale Railway. The TVR absorbed the Company in 1889. High quality limestone workings at Aberthaw encouraged thoughts of a Cowbridge and Aberthaw Railway. This opened in 1892, and was absorbed by the Taff Vale Railway in 1895. The Cowbridge and the Aberthaw sections were operated as a single entity. The Taff Vale Railway introduced railmotors, which it called \\"motor cars\\", on the lines in 1905 and although they were successful, the lines remained loss-making. The passenger service from Cowbridge to Aberthaw was discontinued in 1932; that from Llantrisant to Cowbridge in 1951. A mineral working with a private siding remained in operation until 1975, but when that closed the line ceased to have any railway activity. Taff Vale Railway The Taff Vale Railway was planned to bring the iron production of works at Merthyr and Dowlais, as well as coal from certain collieries, to the docks at Cardiff for onward shipment to market. The Cowbridge RailwayIt opened its main line in two stages, in 1840 and 1841; it was built on the standard gauge. It was immediately successful, and at the same time coal mining enjoyed a massive increase in volume in the area, so that coal became the principal traffic. This encouraged numerous further branch lines and colliery connections, and at the same time the railway encouraged the opening of new mines.D S M Barrie, The Taff Vale Railway, Oakwood Press, Tisbury, second edition 1950 reprinted 1982 South Wales Railway The South Wales Railway was promoted in 1843, to connect the Great Western Railway network at Gloucester to Milford Haven; it was to be a broad gauge line. Its route was the matter of considerable discussion, and at one stage it was assumed it would pass through Cowbridge. However the route as finally determined ran near Llantrisant, about five miles north of Cowbridge; the South Wales Railway opened in several stages but this section was opened on 18 June 1850.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume I: 1833 - 1863, part 1, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1927 The mail road coach service through Cowbridge was almost immediately withdrawn, and the importance of Cowbridge was much diminished.Stewart Williams (editor), South Glamorgan: a County History, published by Stewart Williams, Barry, 1975, 978 0900807190 There is controversy as to whether the people of Cowbridge wanted the South Wales Railway to pass through their town, or resisted it,Herbert Williams, Railways in Wales, Christopher Davies (Publishers) Ltd, Swansea, 1981, ISBN though it seems likely that engineering considerations took the line further north.Richard Griffiths, The Entrepreneurial Society of the Rhondda Valleys, 1840-1920: Power and Influence in the Porth - Pontypridd Region, University of Wales Press, Cardiff, 2010, As soon as the South Wales Railway opened there was a widespread feeling that the town must have a branch line if it could not be on the main line. A number of schemes were put forward, many of them remarkably ambitious and expensive, and for some time the proposals came to nothing.Colin Chapman, The Cowbridge Railway, Oxford Publishing Company, Poole, 1984, Ely Valley Railway The Ely Valley Railway opened its first line in 1860; it was a broad gauge line worked by the Great Western Railway. It had been built to serve iron and coal pits to the north of the South Wales Railway main line. It was not financially successful and it was dependent on its larger sponsor in 1861. Llantrisant and Taff Vale Junction Railway There were iron and coal pits in the area between Treforest and Llantrisant, and after a false start, the Llantrissant and Taff Vale Railway was incorporated by Act of Parliament on 7 June 1861.Colin Chapman, The Llantrisant Branches of the Taff Vale Railway, Oakwood Press, Headington, 1996, It was to reach Llantrisant station on the South Wales Railway main line, but the final mile was over the Ely Valley Railway. As it was being financed by the Taff Vale Railway, the L&TVJR; was on the narrow (standard) gauge, and the Ely Valley Railway was a broad gauge line. The L&TVJR; was to build from the Taff Vale Railway main line, about a mile below Treforest Station, to the Mwyndy branch of the Ely Valley Railway at Maesaraul, where there were important mineral deposits. Running powers were not granted from Maesaraul Junction to Llantrisant Station, which was about two miles south west of the village of that name. It opened the majority of its line in 1863, but the Ely Valley Railway stalled on the provision of mixed gauge track on its line, on which the L&TVJR; was dependent. A railway for Cowbridge The promotion of the L&TVJR; spurred the people of Cowbridge to move forward with their own scheme, and on 1 July 1861 a prospectus for the Cowbridge Railway was published. It was to run from Cowbridge to connect with the L&TVJR; at Maesaraul, north of Llantrisant, crossing the South Wales Railway main line a little east of Llantrisant station, with a spur there to an interchange siding. The capital was to be ¬£30,000, as it was claimed that the cost of construction would be far below the average cost of railway construction locally. The benefits would enable local farmers to get their produce to market cheaply as well as reducing the cost of bringing in coal, and also moving iron ore extracted at Llanharry to be transported away. In November 1861 the Taff Vale Railway agreed to subscribe up to ¬£5,000 towards the scheme, but subscriptions towards the cost of the railway were otherwise very difficult to secure. Indeed the Parliamentary deposit required to proceed with the Bill had to be loaned by the Taff Vale company. At the committee stages of the Cowbridge Railway Bill, the South Wales Railway once again put forward the proposal that the branch should be built on the broad gauge, which would bring it into the \\"associated companies\\" of the broad gauge group. However this last-minute idea was not taken forward. The Cowbridge Railway Act was accordingly passed on 29 July 1862; it had authorised capital of ¬£35,000.D S M Barrie, revised Peter Baughan, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 12: South Wales, David St John Thomas, Nairn, 1994, Securing subscriptions continued to be a serious difficulty, and the directors decided to approach the South Wales Railway for assistance; they met them on 4 November 1862.Chapman is ambiguous about whether it was the South Wales Railway or the Great Western Railway with whom the Cowbridge company negotiated. They asked the South Wales Railway to permit their company to reach the L&TVJR; over the Ely Valley Railway, between Llantrisant and Maesaraul Junction. This would enable them to omit the construction of the northward part of their line above Llantrisant. The broad gauge interest had already shown itself to be hostile to such an incursion, but now the Great Western Railway offered to permit this, and to lay a third rail, forming \\"mixed gauge\\", to enable the running of standard gauge trains, for an annual rental of ¬£400. The Cowbridge directors thought this exceeded the interest on the capital outlay if they built the connecting line, so they decided not to proceed with the request at first, but after further consideration agreed that it was worth pursuing. In fact the GWR agreed to reduce the rental charge to ¬£200, and on that basis the Cowbridge directors concluded an agreement in June 1863. The Board of Trade sanctioned the deviation of the authorised route by which the Cowbridge Railway entered Llantrisant station rather than crossing the South Wales Railway main line. Construction The first sod was cut on 9 June 1863. Work seemed to be progressing well and in June 1864 the company informed the Board of Trade of the intention to open for passenger traffic shortly; however this was soon realised to be premature, and was withdrawn. Subscriptions for shares continued to fall short, and in August 1864 it was announced that contractors had been paid with Lloyds Bonds, that is, promissory notes payable in two or three years. Colonel Yolland, for the Board of Trade, visited the line on 17 December 1864. The third rail on the Ely Valley Railway was not yet ready so no rolling stock had reached the line. Yolland noted that the line was 5 miles 60 chains in length, and that gradients were steep, with a maximum of 1 in 45 near Ystradowen. The down platform of the South Wales Railway (by this time amalgamated into the Great Western Railway) had been altered so as to have a platform face on its south side for the Cowbridge trains, and there was a run-round loop. A standard gauge line owned by the GWR left the Cowbridge line at the west end, and crossed the main line to lead northwards to the Ely Valley line. Yolland was not satisfied with the signalling arrangements at Llantrisant junction, which did not bring all the points and signals to a central interlocking. The waiting room at Llantrisant was so close to the platform edge as to risk accidents to passengers. Ystradowen station was on a very steep gradient, which could have simply been eased, and as it was a passing place, another platform was necessary on the loop line. Accordingly Yolland declined to pass the line for passenger operation. Moreover the L&TVJR; had not provided signalling at Maesaraul Junction, intending to leave it until after the inspection. Inevitably therefore the inspection there failed and the opening of both the Cowbridge Railway and the L&TVJR; section was refused also. On 16 January 1865, the TVR brought an engine over Maesaraul Junction and the mixed gauge section of the Ely Valley Railway, on to the Cowbridge Railway. This engine then worked on the line as a trial. While this was satisfactory, the Taff Vale Railway Engineer, George Fisher, declared himself extremely unhappy with the Cowbridge Railway track. Fisher reported that the works on the line were exceptionally light, and had been executed in the cheapest possible manner. This would result, he thought, in costly maintenance and excessive wear and tear. Considerable alterations would be required before TVR engines could work safely over the railway, and the line would require constant attention and repair during its first year of operation. Notwithstanding the deferral of passenger operation, an opening ceremony took place on 30 January 1865. An ordinary goods service was started on 8 February 1865, and it was decided that two trains a day would suffice. Messrs Griffiths and Thomas would maintain the line for twelve months, for ¬£500 in cash. Work on the alterations required by the Board of Trade was complete (except for Ystradowen station, temporarily deferred) and Captain Rich inspected the railway on 22 March 1865. He was satisfied and approved the opening for passengers. However he also inspected the Llantrisant and Taff Vale Junction Railway; he was dissatisfied with the signalling at Maesaraul Junction, and refused that opening. The third rail over the Ely Valley Railway was also incomplete, so the Cowbridge directors decided not to attempt to operate a passenger service on their own branch line until trains could run through to Pontypridd. Opening and early performance Eventually these difficulties were resolved and on 18 September 1865 the inaugural passenger train ran. The train service consisted of three round trips daily, of which two continued to and from Pontypridd. A Sunday service of two Cowbridge to Pontypridd round trips was also provided. With the exception of these Sunday trains, all trains were mixed, passenger and goods. Rolling stock was rented from the Taff Vale Railway. Receipts for the first month of operation amounted to ¬£212. Ystradowen station was opened in February or March 1866. \\"The Ystradowen station has recently been opened for passengers and goods.\\"Cowbridge Railway Company, in the Cardiff Times, 9 March 1866 To relocate it away from the steep incline, it was now positioned some distance from the village it served. During the second half of 1865, the gross receipts of the Company had been ¬£951, with working expenses of ¬£703. This did not make any allowance for maintenance and renewal of the permanent way. It was stated that \\"some time must elapse before the Cowbridge Railway Company can have a disposable balance of ¬£1,000 per annum.\\" Faced with serious financial difficulties, the Cowbridge company was anxious to lease its line to the Taff Vale Railway, and proposals were submitted to the TVR in August 1866. The Cowbridge Company would lease its railway to the TVR for 3% per annum on capital of ¬£52,000 until 1 January 1870; then 4% for five years and then 5%. Receipts of ¬£1,436 against working expenses of ¬£973 were declared, but this did not include the ¬£200 paid to the GWR for the use of the Ely Valley line, nor for any maintenance of the permanent way which, in the first year alone had cost ¬£500. Paying ¬£1,560 a year escalating, to lease a railway losing ¬£237 a year escalating,3% of ¬£52,000 = ¬£1,560. ¬£1,436 less ¬£973 less ¬£200 less ¬£500 = a loss of ¬£237. The backlog of permanent way repairs was a looming liability. was hardly attractive to the TVR, and they turned the offer down. Financial problems In April 1867 the ironmakers Guest & Co. issued writs against the Cowbridge Railway for payment of ¬£817 owed for the supply of rails. Moreover the Lloyds Bonds which the company had issued to the contractors were becoming due for redemption, and in April 1867, the Company went into bankruptcy. An auction of movable assets was held on 29 April 1867. R C Nichol-Carne, the Company chairman, purchased some items on his own initiative: the engine turntables, carriage shed, weighbridges, water tank and pump, and leased them back to the Company. Later in 1867 the National Provincial Bank was granted possession of the Cowbridge Railway for unpaid debts. The poor standard of maintenance, compounding the inferior standard of construction, concerned the Taff Vale Railway, and in January 1869 the TVR Directors resolved that \\"notice be given to the Cowbridge Railway Company that if their line is not placed in good working condition previously to the 1st of March next, this company will feel obliged to withdraw its rolling stock and plant.\\" The deadline passed but the pressure from the TVR continued, and the Cowbridge company gave notice that it would work the line itself from 5 April 1870. A service of seven return trips between Cowbridge and Llantrisant was inaugurated, four on Sunday, although this was later reduced somewhat. The TVR was left to work into Llantrisant from Pontypridd, and was obliged to contribute to the tolls for using the Ely Valley Railway from Maesaraul, and to the Cowbridge itself for the use of the standard gauge accommodation at Llantrisant. The Cowbridge company opened a new station at Llanharry in August 1871. The facilities were of the most basic kind. In May 1872 the Great Western Railway altered the gauge of the track in South Wales: now its entire South Wales system was standard gauge, and this obviated the necessity for transshipment of goods at Llantrisant. The Cowbridge company had taken over the working of its line, but of course that did not enable it to bring in more income, or to improve the standard of maintenance. In 1874 it emerged that most of the landowners had never received payment for the acquisition of their land in the first place, and lawsuits were now threatened. Repossession of the land was now a possibility. Leased to the Taff Vale Railway In March 1875, the Company once again approached the Taff Vale Railway. A lease was proposed, but again the Cowbridge put forward unrealistic terms. The TVR offered to lease the line for ¬£1,500 per annum rising gradually to ¬£2,000, and these terms were accepted by a shareholders' meeting on 4 May 1875. The effective date of the lease was 1 January 1876. The TVR decided that a fortnight's closure was necessary to enable the necessary track relaying to take place. The passenger service was suspended from 30 November 1875, reopening on 13 December 1875. During this period one goods train ran a round trip daily. On reopening, the through service to Pontypridd was reinstated, and as this reduced the frequent service between Llantrisant and Cowbridge, two extra round trips on the branch were put in. In 1889 the TVR wished to tidy up the arrangement by which it was leasing independently built lines, and the Cowbridge Railway was absorbed by Act of 26 August 1889. Cowbridge and Aberthaw Railway Cowbridge and Aberthaw RailwayAberthaw had long been a source of high quality limestone, which was in demand for burning to make lime. In 1881 Stephen Collier and David Owen went into partnership with a view to establishing lime kilns at Aberthaw. This was not immediately fruitful, but in 1888 works and equipment were provided and the industry took hold. At this time further railway developments in the general area were under consideration, and in November 1888 proposals were published for the Vale of Glamorgan line, which would connect Barry and Bridgend via Aberthaw. The preparations for this motivated the Taff Vale Railway to give support to Collier and Owen, and proposals form a Cowbridge and Aberthaw Railway were deposited in the same month. The TVR guaranteed % on the construction cost, and the Cowbridge and Aberthaw Railway Act was passed on 12 August 1889, with capital of ¬£90,000. Construction of the line proceeded, and on 2 September 1892 Major Yorke of the Board of Trade inspected the line and passed it for passenger operation; it opened on 1 October 1892. The line was 6 miles 53 chains in length, and had cost ¬£120,000 to build. A new station was provided at Cowbridge as the location of the old one did not lend itself to extending the line, and it was downgraded to the status of goods station. There were new stations on the line at St Mary Church Road, St Athan Road, and Aberthaw. There were three passenger trains a day, running between Aberthaw and Pontypridd. The Taff Vale Railway was persuaded to acquire the Cowbridge and Aberthaw Railway company, which it did from 1 January 1895, authorised by Act of 17 August 1894. The lack of a loop to cross trains on the single line at Cowbridge proved to be an operational inconvenience, and a loop was installed, being commissioned in October 1897. The Vale of Glamorgan line opened in that year. It had an Aberthaw station adjacent to the Cowbridge one, but there was no direct connection between the two, for trains or for the public. Motor cars In 1903 the Taff Vale Railway experimented with what it called \\"motor cars\\": in fact railmotors, that is, single passenger coaches with an integrated small steam engine. The intention was to enable a service to remote and lightly trafficked areas by the provision of low-cost stopping places: in practice these were platforms 40 feet in length, at first with no shelter or other facilities. The motor cars were introduced on the Pontypridd to Aberthaw service on 1 May 1905. Nine round trips per day were arranged using two motor cars; a conventional service and a mixed train also operated on the line. There were new stopping places, not able to be used by the conventional trains. They were at Trerhyngyll & Maendy, Aberthin, St Hilary and Llanbeth√™ry. The motor cars had heating in the passenger saloons, a considerable benefit compared with the four-wheel coaches on conventional trains. From May 1908 all the passenger trains were operated by motor cars or auto-trains calling at all the stopping places but the railmotor service was withdrawn on 12th July 1920. In 1884 the Taff Vale Railway had manufactured the \\"I\\" class outside-cylinder 440T locomotives. In later years they worked on the Cowbridge trains until they were displaced by the motor cars. However the railmotors generated more traffic than they could manage, and so the \\"I\\" class re-entered service in December 1907 on auto-trains.H Morgan, South Wales Branch Lines, Ian Allan Ltd, Shepperton, 1984, Aberthaw cement works In 1909 a significant development of iron ore extraction near Llanharry took place, with a long tramway being provided to make the connection. Further south, the Aberthaw & Bristol Channel Portland Cement Company opened a large cement manufacturing plant at Aberthaw in 1913; it was connected to both the Taff Vale line and the Vale of Glamorgan line although through freight traffic was not authorised. No further rail traffic to or from the works via the TV branch took place after 1932 when the line was closed south of Beaupre, 1mile-3chains south of Cowbridge. At that location, track to Aberthaw Low Level was lifted from June 1934 and the line further curtailed at Beggars Bush buffer stop at Cowbridge station, in 1947. Decline of business The passenger service on the Cowbridge to Aberthaw section had declined over a long period. The motor car platforms at Aberthin, St. Hilary and Llanbeth√™ry were closed to passengers on 12 July 1920, so that only Trerhyngyll & Maendy remained open of the 1905 \\"platforms\\". A census of passenger business on the line disclosed that in 1923, 66,140 tickets were sold at Cowbridge Station; the branch as a whole excluding Llantrisant sold 87,800. Just over 3,000 tickets were sold at the three stations south of Cowbridge in 1923. The first daily bus service to Cowbridge was inaugurated in 1920, and proved much more convenient than the trains. A long standing complaint had been the poor connections with the GWR at Llantrisant, so that the dominant flow from Cowbridge to Cardiff was inconvenient by train: it was much better served by the new bus service. In 1926, a review showed that in 1925, expenses incurred on the branch amounted to ¬£18,423. Most of the income was from the iron ore mine at Llanharry, and the remainder of the line generated little: earnings for the three stations amounted to ¬£133 for the whole of 1925. This report resulted in suspension of the passenger service between Cowbridge and Aberthaw from 4 May 1926, but the service was reinstated on 11 July 1927. Ticket sales at Aberthaw in 1928 amounted to only 229 compared with 1,187 in 1923; at St Athan Road the figures were 451 against 1,232 for the same years. Passenger receipts from all three stations on the branch amounted to ¬£60 for the whole of 1928, and the GWR announced its intention to withdraw the service between Cowbridge and Aberthaw from 5 May 1930. The general goods business on the Aberthaw section declined too, as did the small private siding traffic, and the Aberthaw cement works increasingly used the Vale of Glamorgan line as its route for traffic forwarded. By 1932 the Cowbridge to Aberthaw line had become little used by the residual goods service, apart from a small amount of agricultural traffic. The service south of Beaupre siding was withdrawn, and the goods stations were closed on 1 November 1932. The last goods train was handled at Beaupre Quarry siding in 1947, after which the remaining 1 mile 3 chains of line south of Cowbridge was lifted. Decline of the Cowbridge branch In 1951, the withdrawal of the passenger service between Llantrisant and Cowbridge was announced: the date was fixed for 26 November 1951. Llantrisant Station was closed to passengers on 2 November 1964. The goods service from Llantrisant to Cowbridge was withdrawn on 1 February 1965, and the branch was closed to all traffic south of Llanharry Iron Ore Mine.

In the Ramayana, Trijata appears as a wise old rakshasi, who dreams of Ravana's destruction and Rama's victory. She accompanies Sita on a survey of the battlefield of the war between Rama and Ravana, and reassures Sita of Rama's well-being when Sita sees her husband unconscious and presumes him dead. In later Ramayana adaptations, Trijata becomes the daughter of Vibhishana, the brother of Ravana who sides with Rama. She plays a much greater role in later versions, especially Southeast Asian ones. Barring a few exceptions where Trijata is cast as Ravana's agent, she is generally portrayed as a friend and loyal companion of Sita in her adversity. On numerous occasions, she offers solace to Sita and brings news from the outside world; she also dissuades Sita from committing suicide. After Rama's victory and Ravana's death, Trijata is richly rewarded by Sita and Rama. While some Ramayana adaptations mention her being a devotee of Rama, Southeast Asian versions often depict her as the wife of Rama's vanara general Hanuman, whom she bears a son. She is worshipped as a local goddess in Varanasi and Ujjain; both in India. Names While Indian, Javanese and Balinese versions of the Ramayana call her Trijata, she is known as Punukay in the Laotian Phra Lak Phra Lam, Benyakai () in the Thai Ramakien and Devi Seri Jali in the Malay Hikayat Seri Rama.Bose p. 359 The Ramayana Scene from Yuddha Kanda of the Ramayana, where Trijata is seen thrice with Sita. On the top right, Trijata (in a red saree) is seen twice in the Pushpaka Vimana, surveying the battlefield and seeing Rama and Lakshmana bound by Indrajit's weapon. In the right side (bottom panel), she is seen with Sita in the Ashoka vatika. In the original Ramayana by Valmiki, Trijata is described as an aged rakshasi (demoness) who is prominently featured in two incidents. The first takes place in the Sundara Kanda, the epic's fifth book. The kidnapped princess Sita is imprisoned in the Ashoka Vatika of Lanka. The demon-king of Lanka, Ravana has ordered the raskshasis who guard Sita to convince her to marry him by any means possible, since Sita adamantly refuses and is still faithful to her husband Rama. After Ravana leaves, the rakshasis start to harass Sita to compel her to change her will. The aged Trijata intervenes and narrates a prophetic dream that predicts Ravana's doom and Rama's victory.Bulcke pp. 104‚Äì5 In her dream, Trijata sees Rama and his brother Lakshmana riding the celestial elephant Airavata toward Sita. Rama takes Sita in his lap and rises high in the sky, allowing Sita to touch the Sun and the Moon. Then the trio ride to Lanka and get into the Pushpaka Vimana (aerial chariot of Ravana) to fly towards the north, while Ravana, drenched in oil and with a red complexion, lies on the ground. Ravana then heads south on a donkey and falls in a pit of dung. A black woman in a red saree, drags him to the south. Other members of Ravana's family, like his brother Kumbhakarna and son Indrajit, face similar fates. Ravana's brother Vibishana is seen in regal white garments, riding a four tusked elephant near the Pushpaka Vimana. The city of Lanka drowns in the ocean and a vanara) messenger of Rama burns the city. Trijata advises the rakshasis to take refuge in Sita and apologise to her; in turn, Sita promises that if Trijata's dream materialises, she will protect her rakshasi guards. The second incident is found in the sixth book, Yuddha Kanda. Rama and his brother Lakshmana come with a vanara army to rescue Sita from the clutches of the demon-king. On the first day of war, Ravana's son Indrajit binds the brothers with the weapon Nagapasha (serpent-noose) and the brothers lose consciousness. Ravana sends Sita with Trijata to see the battlefield. Thinking her husband is dead, Sita laments, but is reassured by Trijata that the brothers are still alive. Trijata expresses her love for Sita and tells her that the captive's \\"moral character and gentle nature\\" have compelled her to love her. Trijata and Vibhishana In the Ramayana, Sita has few other rakshasi benefactors besides Trijata. When Hanuman ‚Äì the vanara-general of Rama who was tasked to find Sita ‚Äì meets her in Lanka, she tells him that the wife of Vibhishana (the brother of Ravana who sides with Rama in the war) sent her daughter Kala (in other recensions of the Ramayana, known as Nanda or Anala) to proclaim Ravana's intention to not surrender Sita to Rama, despite the advice of the wise minister Avindhya and Vibhisana. Another friend, Sarama, consoles Sita when Ravana shows Sita an illusory severed head of Rama. She also informs her of Rama's well-being and his entry in Lanka with his army. In some versions of the Ramayana, an interpolated canto mentions how Sarama also tells Sita of the burning of Lanka by Hanuman after his meeting with Sita. Ravana's wife Mandodari is described to have rescued Sita in some versions, when Ravana tries to kill Sita. In later Rama-centric literature, Sarama was identified as Vibishana's wife, while Trijata was regarded as his daughter.Bulcke pp. 105‚Äì7 The Tamil epic Kamba Ramayana, Govindaraja's commentary on the Ramayana (Bhushana), the Oriya Balaramadasa Ramayana, the Javanese Kakawin Ramayana and the Malay Seri Rama all accord the status of Vibhishana's daughter to Trijata, a trend generally followed by post-Ramayana literature. Though Govindaraja's commentary on the Ramayana states that Trijata is Vibhishana's daughter in the epic, Goldman considers this \\"strange\\" given her advanced age in the original epic.Goldman p. 422 A few works relate Trijata to Vibhishana in a position other than his daughter. The Ananda Ramayana and the Marathi Bhavartha Ramayana of Eknath regard Trijata as the wife and the sister of Vibhishana (thus sister of Ravana) respectively.Bulcke pp. 107‚Äì8 The Jain version, the Vasudevahindi of Samghadasa Gani, says Trijata is a sister of Ravana, Vibhishana, Kumbhakarna, and Shurpanakha.Shah p. 63 Jayamangala's commentary on the Bhattikavya also describes Trijata as Ravana's sister.Leonardi p. 80 Trijata and Sita Hanuman meets Sita in the Ashoka vatika, where she is surrounded by rakshasis like Trijata. In later literature, Trijata plays the roles which were attributed to Kala, Sarama, and Mandodari in the original Ramayana.Bulcke p. 105 She becomes a more important character in Southeast Asian versions of the Ramayana,Nagar p. 389 particularly in Indonesian retellings such as the Kakawin Ramayana. In the Ramopakhyana (the narrative of Rama in the epic Mahabharata), Sita informs Hanuman that Trijata brought her a message from Avindhya about the well-being of Rama, and that he and Lakshamana will soon come to rescue her from Lanka. Trijata thus assumes the role assigned to Kala in the original Ramayana.Bulcke p. 108 The Raghuvamsa, the Setubandha, the Balaramadasa Ramayana, the Kakawin Ramayana and the Seri Rama all replace Sarama with Trijata in the episode where the truth of the illusory head of Rama is revealed to Sita. The Prasannaraghava has Trijata inform Sita about the burning of Lanka, instead of Sarama. The Balaramadasa Ramayana makes Trijata the saviour of Sita, when she stops Ravana from killing Sita in the Ashoka Vatika; this role was originally assigned to Mandodari. Trijata again saves Sita's life when a vengeful Ravana rushes to slay his captive after his son Indrajit is killed in the war. In the Ramayana, Suparshva ‚Äì a minister of Ravana ‚Äì stops him, while other adaptations attribute the act variously to Avindhya or Mandodari. Besides crediting Trijata for acts attributed to others in the original epic, later literature adds new elements which grant Trijata a bigger role. In the Ramayana, just before meeting Hanuman, the thought of suicide crosses Sita's mind, but she never attempts it. In the Prasannaraghava, Trijata and Sita engage in a \\"friendly conversation\\" before Ravana comes to meet her. After Ravana's departure, Sita tells Trijata of her intent to commit suicide and urges Trijata to help her create a wood pyre. Trijata, however, refuses, saying there is not enough firewood.Bulcke pp. 108‚Äì9 The Kakawin Ramayana also narrates that, when Sita sees the illusory severed heads of Rama and Lakshmana, she prepares a pyre. Trijata is ready to die with Sita, but first wants to inform her father Vibhishana. She returns with the news of Rama's well-being. Later on, after seeing Rama and Lakshmana bound by Indrajit's Nagapasha, Sita instructs Trijata to again create a pyre, but Trijata holds off until she can confirm the truth from her father, and returns with the news that Rama is alive. Many adaptations of the Ramayana narrate the friendship and companionship developed between Trijata and Sita. Trijata fulfils two important objectives: she comforts Sita and constantly updates Sita about the happenings of the war and the welfare of Rama. The Balaramadasa Ramayana describes Trijata assuaging Sita's grief when they hear that Indrajit has wounded Rama and Lakshmana a second time. In the Balaramayana of Rajasekhara, Trijata employs two rakshasas to bring her news from the battlefield. The Ananda Ramayana narrates that, upon hearing Lakshmana's conch sound, Sita urges Trijata to find out what has happened. Trijata learns of the death of Indrajit by Lakshmana and passes the news to Sita. The Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas also depicts Trijata breaking the news of Indrajit's death to Sita, upon her inquiry.Nagar p. 364 In another episode in the text, the two discuss the impending duel between Rama and Ravana on the final day of war. Sita is concerned that the ten-headed Ravana is invincible and will magically regrow his severed heads. Trijata reassures Sita that Rama will slay Ravana by shooting an arrow through the demon-king's heart.Bulcke p. 109 The text emphasises that Trijata is a devotee of Rama, a feature also found in the Bhavartha Ramayana. The Kakawin Ramayana says that, when Sita is tormented by her 300 rakshasi guards, only Trijata comes to her rescue and offers her solace, keeping her company and playing games with her.Bulcke pp. 110‚Äì111 In the Seri Rama, Trijata (here called \\"Dewi Srijati\\") is in charge of Sita's custody in Lanka. Sita tells Ravana that she will not even consider Ravana's marriage proposal while her husband is alive, and will believe he's dead only if she sees his head in Ravana's hands. To trick Sita, Ravana visits her with two heads and proclaims that they belong to Rama and Lakshmana, but Trijata stops him and asks him to return the next day. She presents the heads to Sita, who decides to commit suicide, but Trijata asks her to wait until she can verify the truth. Carrying Sita's dagger, she meets Rama and in return receives a girdle woven by Sita from Rama. She is carried back to Lanka by Hanuman. When Ravana arrives the next day, Trijana rebukes him for his deception and informs him that she had met Rama herself the previous day. An enraged Ravana tries to kill Trijata, who runs and seeks refuge in Sita, who takes all the blame. Trijata is recused of her duties and Sita is transferred to an iron castle, guarded by an army commanded by one of Ravana's ministers.Bulcke pp. 111‚Äì112 Trijata as Ravana's agent Balinese Kecak dance, Trijata is trying to convince Sita to marry Ravana. While Trijata is generally portrayed in a positive light, the early Jain versions of the Ramayana either ignore her or demonise her as an agent of Ravana. Svayambhudeva's Paumacriu, as well as Hemachandra's Yogashastra and Ramayana, say that when Hanuman meets Sita and shows her Rama's signet-ring, Sita is overjoyed; Trijata reports this to her master Ravana. Hemachandra emphasises that Trijata's job was to \\"tempt\\" Sita at Ravana's behest. The Krittivasi Ramayana, possibly influenced by Jain narratives, portrays Trijata appealing to Sita to wed Ravana and rule as the queen of Lanka; it is Sarama who functions as Sita's friend in this version.Bulcke p. 110 After the war Numerous Ramayana adaptations record the gratitude of Sita and Rama who reward Trijata richly. In the Mahabharata version, Trijata is rewarded and honoured by Rama at the end of the war. The Balaramayana mentions that after the war, Trijata accompanies Sita to her kingdom Ayodhya in the Pushpaka Vimana; Rama uses the Pushpaka Vimana to return to Ayodhya. In the Ananda Ramayana, both Trijata and Sarama journey to Ayodhya in the Pushpaka Vimana. Later, when Sita visits Lanka, she tells Sarama to treat Trijata as if she would her. The Kakawin Ramayana mentions how Trijata is honoured with rich gifts by Sita at Ayodhya as her loyal companion and solace, and the one who saved her life twice.Bulcke p. 111 The oldest Indian manuscript to mention Trijata's presence in Ayodhya is the Paumacriu. Many suggest that, after Sita's exile and the subsequent battle between Rama and his sons, Sita be reaccepted by Rama. Trijata and Lankasundari are called from Lanka to attest to Sita's chastity and both of them suggest an ordeal to convince the world of her purity. In the Thai Ramakien, Hanuman helps Vibhishana (here called Phipek) kill a demon. Hanuman then marries Trijata (Benchakai); their union results in the birth of a son, Asurapada, a demon with a monkey head. In the Malay version, after the great war, Vibhishana requests that Hanuman wed his daughter Trijata (Seri Jati). Hanuman agrees, on the condition that he remain with her for only a month. While Hanuman leaves for Ayodhya with Rama, Trijata gives birth to his son Hanuman Tegangga (Asurapada).Kam 2000 The Javanese and Sundanese Wayang puppet tradition also portrays Trijata as the wife of Hanuman. It is said that Trijata was reborn as Subhadra in her next birth during the Dwapara Yuga. Remembrance and assessment Trijata is remembered as a friend and loyal companion of Sita in her time of need. Camille Bulcke, an expert on the literature of Rama, summarises Trijata's character: > For more than twenty centuries the poets, who retold the RƒÅma-story, have > dealt lovingly on TrijatƒÅ's friendship for Sƒ´tƒÅ. [...] [TrijatƒÅ] conquered > the heart of those poets, and through them, the heart of all those who > become acquainted with the RƒÅma-story. [...] the poets of the RƒÅmƒÅyana [...] > conferred on the humble TrijatƒÅ the boon of immortality. No dream is better > known in India than the dream of TrijatƒÅ, who will live for ever in the > hearts of millions as the ideal of a true friend, because she comforted Sƒ´tƒÅ > in her darkest hour: A FRIEND IN NEED IS A FRIEND INDEED.Bulcke p. 112 A temple dedicated to Trijata (called Tirjata in this region) is situated near the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, the most prominent temple in Varanasi. As per local lore, Trijata wanted to accompany Sita to Ayodhya, but Sita said that she would not be allowed in Ayodhya as she was a demoness. Sita suggested her to visit Varanasi and attain moksha (emancipation) and blessed her to be worshipped as a goddess. Trijata enjoys daily worship as a local goddess. Flowers and green vegetables are offered to appease her. Women - who worship at her shrine for seven consecutive Wednesdays - are believed to be blessed with progeny and with the goddess' protective glaze on their family. Many devotees flock the shrine on Kartik Poornima, the last day of the Hindu month of Kartik and its next day, the first day of Margashirsha month. It is believed that the goddess will fulfill the wishes of all who worship at her shrine, after paying obeisance at Kashi Vishwanath Temple on Kartik Poornima. Alt URL On the first day of Margashirsha, worshippers who had observed a vrata (fast) in the previous month of Kartik conclude the vrata by bathing in the Ganges at the Dashashwamedh Ghat in the name of Trijata. Local lore holds that Rama granted a boon to Trijata: those who do not bathe in her honour after observing the vrata will lose all merit (punya) ‚Äì gained from the fast ‚Äì to her.Pintchman pp. 41‚Äì42 A temple of Trijata also exists in the temple complex of Balveer Hanuman Temple, Ujjain. Special puja (worship rituals) is offered to the goddess for 3 days, starting from Kartik Poornima. In the Telugu Sita Puranamu, Ramaswami Chaudari portrays Trijata as the daughter of the Dravidian Vibhishana and the Aryan Gandharva Sarama. Trijata, a half-Aryan, is labelled a traitor, who betrays her uncle Ravana and helps Sita. Vibhishana's betrayal towards his brother and defection to Rama is also blamed on his Aryan wife.Rao pp. 176‚Äì77 Notes References    * Category:Rakshasa in the Ramayana Category:Hindu goddesses ","title":"Trijata"},{"id":"43078543","text":"Events in the year 1976 in Bolivia.

History After the deposition of the last Western Emperor in 476, Heruli leader Odoacer was appointed Dux Italiae (\\"Duke of Italy\\") by the reigning Byzantine Emperor Zeno. Later, the Germanic foederati, the Scirians and the Heruli, as well as a large segment of the Italic Roman army, proclaimed Odoacer Rex Italiae (\\"King of Italy\\").Bury, History, vol. 1 p. 406 In 493, the Ostrogothic king Theoderic the Great killed Odoacer, and set up a new dynasty of kings of Italy. Ostrogothic rule ended when Italy was reconquered by the Byzantine Empire in 552. In 568, the Lombards entered the peninsula and ventured to recreate a barbarian kingdom in opposition to the Empire, establishing their authority over much of Italy, except the Exarchate of Ravenna and the duchies of Rome, Venetia, Naples and the southernmost portions. In the 8th century, estrangement between the Italians and the Byzantines allowed the Lombards to capture the remaining Roman enclaves in northern Italy. However, in 774, they were defeated by the Franks under Charlemagne, who deposed their king and took up the title \\"king of the Lombards\\". After the death of Charles III the Fat in 887, Italy fell into instability and a number of kings attempted to establish themselves as independent Italian monarchs. During this period, known as the Feudal Anarchy (888‚Äì962), the title Rex Italicorum (\\"King of the Italians\\" or \\"King of the Italics\\") was introduced. After the breakup of the Frankish empire, Otto I added Italy to the Holy Roman Empire and continued the use of the title Rex Italicorum. The last to use this title was Henry II (1004‚Äì1024). Subsequent emperors used the title \\"king of Italy\\" until Charles V. At first they were crowned in Pavia, later Milan, and Charles was crowned in Bologna. In 1805, Napoleon I was crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy at the Milan Cathedral. The next year, Holy Roman Emperor Francis II abdicated his imperial title. From the deposition of Napoleon I (1814) until the Italian Unification (1861), there was no Italian monarch claiming the overarching title. The Risorgimento successfully established a dynasty, the House of Savoy, over the whole peninsula, uniting the kingdoms of Sardinia and the Two Sicilies to form the modern Kingdom of Italy. The monarchy was superseded by the Italian Republic, after a constitutional referendum was held on 2 June 1946 after the World War II.Nohlen, D & St√∂ver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p1047 The Italian monarchy formally ended on 12 June of that year, and Umberto II left the country.

The original establishment is in Spitalfields, near to where the architect Nicholas Hawksmoor built Christ Church. Subsequently, there are five other restaurants in London: in Seven Dials, Air Street nearby Piccadilly Circus, Knightsbridge, Guildhall district of the City and Borough, near Borough Market. Hawksmoor also have two restaurants outside of London, Hawksmoor Manchester on Deansgate, near Spinningfields and Hawksmoor Edinburgh opened in 2018, just off St Andrews Square. Hawksmoor New York will be opening in 2020. Development The restaurant was founded by Will Beckett and Huw Gott in 2006. They had previously worked in bars and kitchens in London's East End and opened their new bar/restaurant on Commercial Street there. Their plan was to offer high- quality, well-butchered beef, so they tasted a range of beef from all over the world, until coming to the conclusion that the best tasting steak was from the UK. Their second branch in Seven Dials was opened in 2010. This was especially successful and the turnover of their company, Underdog, increased from ¬£4 million to ¬£11 million. In 2013, the founders sold a majority stake in the chain to the private equity group Graphite Capital ‚Äî investors in other London businesses such as the Groucho Club and Wagamama. The valuation was ¬£35 million but the founders planned to continue to work and invest in the business. The company has been ranked three star Sunday Times Best Companies for eight consecutive years (in 2014 was the best restaurant company to work for), three star Sustainable Restaurant Association award as well as being involved in variety of charity projects (predominantly for Action Against Hunger, for which Hawksmoor has raised/donated over ¬£1m). Reception Giles Coren, reviewing the Seven Dials branch in The Times, praised it as \\"great, great steak. Best you‚Äôll find anywhere. ... cooked medium rare at Hawksmoor's suggestion and had deep black charry cooking flavours and sweet pink fruity juices.

The journal ceased publication in 1872. Content The primary readership of the journal was Southern planters. As a result, much of the content focused on agricultural matters. However, it also published articles about politics, education and literature. Indeed, the byline read, \\"Devoted to Southern Agriculture, Designed to improve the Mind, and Elevate the Characters of the Tillers of the Soil, and to Introduce a More Enlightened System of Culture.\\".Google Books A large number of poems written by Confederate poets were published in its pages.

He is the primary deity of the Uchchhishta Ganapatya sect, one of six major schools of the Ganapatyas. He is worshipped primarily by heterodox vamachara rituals. He is one of the thirty- two forms of Ganesha, frequently mentioned in devotional literature. Herambasuta was one of the exponents of the Uchchhishta Ganapatya sect. Name The god derives his name from Uchchhishta (\\"leftovers\\"). The word refers to the food left over at the end of a ritual, but in this context refers to its Tantric connotation. Uchchhishta is the food kept in the mouth, which is contaminated with saliva, thus ritually impure and a taboo in Hinduism. Iconography The elephant-headed god is described to be reddish in colour in the Mantra-maharnava, while mentioned as dark in the Uttara- kamikagama. Another description describes him to be blue in complexion. The deity is described to have four or six arms. He is described to be seated, sometimes specifically noted in on padmasana (a lotus pedestal). The Uttara- kamikagama elaborates that he wears a ratna mukuta (jewelled crown) and has a third eye on his forehead. The Kriyakramadyoti mentions that the god carries in his six hands: a lotus (in some descriptions, a blue lotus), a pomegranate, the veena, an akshamala (rosary) and a rice sprig. As per the Mantra- maharnava, he carries a bana (arrow), a dhanus (bow), a pasha (noose) and an ankusha (elephant goad). The Uttara-kamikagama says that the god has four arms and holds a pasha, an ankusha and a sugarcane in three hands. Uchchhishta Ganapati, Nageswaraswamy Temple, Kumbakonam. The deities touch each other's genitalia. Rao classifies Uchchhishta Ganapati as one of the five Shakti- Ganesha icons, where Ganesha is depicted with a shakti, that is, a female consort.Rao p. 53 The large figure of Ganesha is accompanied with smaller figure of the consort. The nude devi (goddess) sits on his left lap. She has two arms and wears various ornaments. In the Uttara-kamikagama, she is called Vighneshvari and is prescribed to be sculpted as a beautiful, young maiden. The fourth hand of Uchchhishta Ganapati touches the genitalia of the naked goddess. The Mantra-maharnava prescribes that the god should be depicted as though he is trying to have intercourse. The textual descriptions generally do not correspond to the sculptures of the deity. Uchchhishta Ganapati is always shown with a naked consort, who is seated on his left lap. The god is generally depicted with four arms and holds a pasha, an ankusha and a ladoo or a modak (a sweet), while the fourth arm hugs the nude goddess around her hip. She holds a lotus or another flower in the left hand.Rao pp. 64-5 Instead of his hands, the tip of his elephant trunk touches the yoni (vagina) of the goddess. Occasionally, the goddess touches the lingam (phallus) of the god with her right hand. The god is depicted ithyphallic in the latter icon. Such erotic imagery is restricted to his four-armed form. Cohen notes that many Ganesha icons are depicted with a shakti, seated on his left hip. She holds a plate of modaks in her lap and the god's trunk reaches into it, to fetch the sweet. The trunk is taken as a symbolic of an \\"erotic bond\\" between Ganesha and the goddess. The Uchchhishta Ganapati takes the idea a step further, by eliminating the bowl of sweets and allowing the trunk to reach the goddess' yoni. This erotic iconography reflects the influence of the Tantric Ganapatya (the sect that considered Ganesha as the Supreme Being) sects. The pomegranate is also a symbol of fertility, often represented in the icons of the sects.Cohen, Lawrence in Brown pp. 120‚Äì1 Worship Uchchhishta Ganapati, folio from the 19th-century Sritattvanidhi. A rare depiction of the deity with a clothed goddess. As per the Kriyakramadyoti, Uchchhishta Ganapati is worshipped as a giver of great boons. Rao notes that he is worshipped by \\"many\\" to gain the desired from the deity.Rao pp. 53-5 He is also regarded as the guardian of the country. Meditating over his form is said to impart control over the five sensory organs. A temple dedicated to Uchchhishta Ganapati exists in Tirunelveli, where he is worshipped as a giver of progeny. Uchchhishta Ganapati is the patron of the Uchchhishta Ganapatya sect, one of the six major schools of the Ganapatya sect. They follow Tantric Vamachara (\\"left-handed\\") practices. The sect may have been influenced by the Kaula worship of Shaktism (Goddess-oriented sect).Bhandarkar p. 213 The iconography of the deity bears Kaula Tantric character. The erotic iconography is interpreted to convey the oneness of Ganesha and Devi (\\"The Hindu Divine Mother\\"). The sect also worships a Ganesha, who is depicted drinking wine and also its use in worship, a taboo in classical Hinduism (see Panchamakara). Adherents of this sect wear red marks on their foreheads.Nagar p. 59 This sect does not believe in caste and varna distinctions, disregards the orthodox Hindu rules of sexual intercourse and marriage and leaves the adherence of traditional Hindu rituals to the follower's own will.Sanford, James H.. \\"Literary Aspects of Japan's Dual-Gane≈õa Cult\\", in Brown, pp. 313‚Äì15. As per Vamachara practices, the deity is worshipped when the devotee is in the Uchchhishta (\\"ritually impure\\") state, that is, nude or with remnants of food (Uchchhishta) in his mouth. Uchchhishta Ganapati is also associated with six rituals of abhichara (uses of spells for malevolent purposes) by which the adept can cause the target to suffer delusions, be overcome with irresistible attraction or envy, or to be enslaved, paralysed or killed.Grewal pp. 122‚Äì3 The Kanchi Ganesh shrine within the Jagannath Temple, Puri houses the icon of Uchchhishta Ganapati, also called Bhanda Ganapati and Kamada Ganapati, which was originally the patron icon of Kanchipuram (Kanchi), but was brought to Puri as war booty when the Gajapati king Purushottama Deva (1470‚Äì97) of Puri defeated Kanchi. A temple in Tirunelveli is described as the largest temple in Asia dedicated to him.

Established about 1835, it has been in agricultural use since then, with many of its owners also engaged in small commercial or industrial pursuits on the side. The main farmhouse is one of the town's best examples of Gothic Revival architecture. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history Elm Farm is located in rural northern Danville, on the west side of Main Street just south of its junction with Beach Plain Road. The property consists of of land, stretching in a relatively narrow strip all the way west to the town line with Sandown. The westernmost portions of the property consists of woods and swamp, while the immediately west of the road are given over to crops, pasture, and the farmstead. The farmstead is a typical 19th-century New England connected construction, including a 2-1/2 story farmhouse with Greek Revival and Gothic Revival features, which is attached by a series of two ells to a three-story stable. South of this grouping is a set of outbuildings, including a second stable, cow barn, carriage barn, equipment shed, and hen house. The farmhouse is distinctive in the town as one of its only examples of Gothic architecture. The property has been in agricultural use since at least 1835, when Samuel Sargent Jr. purchased part of the 7th lot of the town's original land grants made in 1760. In addition to farming the land, Bailey manufactured barrels and chairs. His son Bailey operated a variety of businesses, including a cider mill, and offered stabling services. Bailey's son Alfred ran a small printing operation here, and his other son Herbert repaired clocks. These businesses were typically conducted out of the second ell of the farmstead, which may have been built specifically for such non-agricultural uses.

He is best known for his fashion photography, published between the mid 1950s and the late 1980s. Horvat's photographic opus includes photojournalism, portraiture, landscape, nature, and sculpture.Contemporary photographers, dir. Martin Marix Evans, article \\"Horvat Frank\\", St James Press, Detroit, 1995, pp 508‚Äì511. In 1988, he produced a book of interviews with fellow photographers such as Don McCullin, Robert Doisneau, Sarah Moon, Helmut Newton, and Marc Riboud. At the beginning of the 1990s, he was one of the first major photographers to experiment with Photoshop. In 1998, he replaced his professional equipment with a compact camera. In 2011, he introduced Horvatland, an on-line iPad application.  Biography  Horvat was born in Abbazia, Italy (now Opatija, Croatia) into a Jewish family from Central Europe (his father, Karl, was a Hungarian general physician and his mother, Adele, was a psychiatrist from Vienna), Horvat has lived in several countries including Switzerland, Italy, Pakistan, India, England, and America). In 1955, he settled in France. = The 1950s = Horvat acknowledges having been strongly influenced by Henri Cartier-Bresson. After meeting him in 1950, he followed his advice and replaced his Rollei with a Leica camera and embarked on a two-year journey through Asia as a free-lance photojournalist. His photographs from this trip were published by Life, R√©alit√©s, Match, Picture Post, Die Woche, and Revue. His photograph of an Indian bride under a veil, her face reflected in a mirror on her lap, was selected by Edward Steichen for The Family of Man exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art which toured the world to be seen by 9 million visitors. In 1955, Horvat moved from London to Paris and found that the mood of its streets and its inhabitants had little in common with the somewhat romantic vision of the so-called humanist photographers. In 1957, Horvat shot fashion photographs for Jardin des Modes using a 35-mm camera and available light,Camera, monthly international magazine about photography, √©d. C. J. Bucher, Lucerne, Swiss, 1957. which formerly had rarely been used for fashion. This innovation was welcomed by ready-to-wear designers, because it presented their creations in the context of everyday life. In the following years, Horvat was commissioned to do similar work for Elle in Paris, Vogue in London, and Harper‚Äôs Bazaar in New York. = The 1960s and 1970s = Between 1962 and 1963, Horvat turned to photojournalism and took a trip around the world for the German magazine Revue. Then he experimented with cinema and video. In 1976, he decided to \\"become his own client\\" by producing three personal projects: Portraits of Trees (1976‚Äì82), Very Similar (1982-86) and New York Up and Down (1982‚Äì87), which he called his \\"triptych\\".DE PACE Loredana, \\"Il labirinto di Horvat\\" in Foto cult, nov 2011, year VIII, n 82, pp 68‚Äì74 = The 1980s = In the 1980s, Horvat suffered from an eye disease. He began a new project: a series of interviews with fellow photographers, such as Edouard Boubat, Robert Doisneau, Mario Giacomelli, Josef Koudelka, Don McCullin, Sarah Moon, Helmut Newton, Marc Riboud, Jeanloup Sieff and Joel-Peter Witkin. They were published in France under the title Entre Vues. = The 1990s = In the 1990s, Horvat became interested in computer technology and produced Yao the Cat (1993), Bestiary (1994), and Ovid‚Äôs Metamorphoses (1995). He transgressed the Cartier- Bressonian rule of the \\"decisive moment\\" by combining parts of images shot at different times and in different places.BERNARD Herv√©, Frank Horvat, le tirage sur ordinateur\\", Photographie, n. 1494, May 1992, pp 24‚Äì27. A few years later, he produced A Trip to Carrara. = The Third Millennium = His later projects are perhaps his most personal. 1999 is a photo-diary of the last year of the millennium, shot with a tiny analog camera designed for amateurs. Entre Vues and La V√©ronique were taken with the first digital Nikon within a 30-meter range, either inside his home in Provence or in its immediate surroundings. Eye at the Fingertips, started in 2006 and still in progress, is photographed with a digital compact camera. His latest enterprise is an iPad application called Horvatland, which contains more than 2,000 photos produced over the course of 65 years with 20 hours of commentary. In 2008, he received the La Fondazione del Centenario Award in Lugano, Switzerland, for his contribution to European culture.

The band was formed in late 1998 by guitarists Evan Patterson and Robby Scott, bassist Ty Kreft, vocalist Casper Adams, and drummer Phil Stosberg. Influenced by the Washington, D.C. hardcore punk scene and contemporary bands like Deadguy, The National Acrobat \\"quickly earned a reputation for their engaging, humorous, and often confrontational live performances\\". In June 1999, The National Acrobat released its eponymous debut EP through a small record label that Kreft and Scott formed together. The band immediately embarked on an east coast and midwest American tour with Canadian band Dead Season. After playing in support of the record, dissent in the band's ranks resulted with the departure of the aforementioned members. Scott was replaced by Evan Patterson's elder brother Ryan (who had up until this point acted as their manager), and Kreft was replaced by Tod Depp. This new lineup recorded material for a planned split EP with Dead Season; but which was eventually released as The National Acrobat, for All Practical Purposes, Is Dead EP in May 2000. This last release featured the Patterson brothers handling bass duties, following Depp's departure, and crediting them to the common punk pseudonym Dale Nixon. For the subsequent live performances, Stephen George filled on bass, as The National Acrobat played the Midwest and Northeast with groups like Isis and Burn It Down. The band's next release was the It's Nothing Personal EP in October 2000, recorded with the assistance of members of Elliott. In December, the band released the Can't Stop Casper Adams EP.

Ombersley Post Office opened on 1 May 1884 and closed on 30 March 1963. Mount Hesse Station, a historic homestead listed on the Victorian Heritage Register and classified by the National Trust of Australia, is located within Ombersley. It was developed as a pastoral property around 1837, and the first homestead was built in the early 1840s. A succession of still surviving outbuildings followed thereafter, including a store (1843), shepherd's hut (1849), stables (1849, extended in 1873), woolshed (1852) and gate lodge (1873). The main Mount Hesse homestead was built in 1856, and extended in 1873. It was severely damaged by fire in 1941 and rebuilt in 1947. The property has historical associations with a number of prominent 19th century pastoralists and businessmen, and the stables and woolshed are amongst the oldest surviving examples of their kind in the state. A second historic homestead, Mountside Homestead, is also located within Ombersley. It was built in 1876 after the original Mount Hesse estate was divided into three properties, and is also classified by the National Trust of Australia. The locality includes Mount Gellibrand, an extinct scoria volcano and the future site of a wind farm.

It was released in 1975 and reached No.7 on the New Zealand album charts. The album, which became a sought-after collectors item on vinyl, was re-released in 2013 on vinyl and CD with a bonus disc, Misfit, a previously unreleased album recorded by the band in 1976. Three singles were taken from the album‚Äî\\"The Dolphin Song\\"/\\"Letters\\", \\"Arrow\\"/Clock House Shuffle\\" and \\"At the Beach\\"/Waitress\\". Background In 1975 Roger Jarrett, the editor of Auckland music magazine Hot Licks, introduced the band to Kerry Thomas and Guy Morris, co-owners of Direction Records, a chain of stores and a burgeoning independent record label. On 7 July 1975 the band began a five-day recording session for their debut album at Stebbing Studios in Jervois Rd, Ponsonby, across the road from the eight-bedroom colonial villa where Waves members lived. Thomas arranged expatriate New Zealand producer Peter Dawkins, then living in Sydney, to return to Auckland to produce the album. Gash said: \\"Dawkins had five days, and he marshalled us through the procedures in a most efficient fashion. That was his job, and he did it well. He was tough though: one of our friends wasn‚Äôt cutting it quickly enough with his solo, and Peter made me go into the studio and fire him on the spot ... We freely availed ourselves of notable contributors. Some‚ÄîMike Chunn, Mike Caen, Roy Mason‚Äîwere personal friends; others‚ÄîVic Williams, Murray Grindlay, Mike Harvey, Paul Lee‚Äîwere introduced to us in the studio.\\" He told The New Zealand Herald: \\"We were in a world we had dreamed of being in. It was a mix of excitement and terror.\\" At the end of the week, Dawkins flew back to Sydney with the finished tapes to mix them. \\"No doubt, in his world this was standard procedure,\\" Gash said. \\"However what it did was disengage us from the process. When the mixes came back to Auckland, we didn‚Äôt understand them. They were not the way we heard ourselves. We voiced our desire to remix the album. Almost miraculously, Kerry Thomas agreed, and gained my gratitude forever. We kept Peter‚Äôs mixes of \\"Waterlady Song\\" and \\"Arrow\\"; the rest the band remixed at Stebbings with (engineer) Phil Yule, and that is what appeared on the album.\\" The band recorded a second album in 1976 for WEA Records, on which they began to explore a new direction with electric guitars. With recording almost complete, they were told that a WEA executive did not like the result and had ordered the multi-track tapes to be recorded over. 2013 re-release In early 2013 the band was contacted by Roger Marbeck of Ode Records and music enthusiast and archivist Grant Gillanders to reissue the 1975 Waves album‚Äîby then a collectors' item fetching high prices‚Äîon CD and vinyl for Record Store Day in April, with the release launched by a live performance at the Real Groovy record store in Auckland. Informed for the first time of the existence of a second album, albeit in a rudimentary form, Marbeck decided to release them both as a double CD. Only then was it discovered the original master tapes for the Waves album had vanished with the collapse in the 1970s of Direction Records. \\"With the Waves album, we have never been able to find any tapes, so it came down to the small number of unplayed vinyls I had stashed away under the bed for the last 38 years,\\" Gash said. \\"They were old, but mint, and I took them to Stebbings, where we ran them on a very high-end turntable and transferred it all to digital files. It worked superbly. We then mastered it there for vinyl with Steve McGough, pulling in the original engineer, Phil Yule, to listen as well. I then redid all the cover art and designed a new insert for photos and info, Kevin did a take on the original Direction label, and we sent it all off for cutting, pressing and packaging to United Record Pressing in Nashville.\\" He said: \\"It actually sounds good, if not better, than the original.\\" For the previously unreleased 1976 album, McGough also took the single tape that existed of the unmixed recordings and transferred it to digital, while Marbeck succeeded in locating the multi-track tapes of \\"Vegas\\", the final song Waves recorded, in July 1977.

The district extends along the north side of Water Street, roughly from Main Street to Front Street, and then along both sides of Water and High streets to the latter's junction with Portsmouth Street. It also includes properties on Chestnut Street on the north side of the Squamscott River. This area was where the early settlement of Exeter took place in 1638, and soon developed as a shipbuilding center. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It was enlarged in 1986 to include the mill complex of the Exeter Manufacturing Company on Chestnut Street. Description and history Exeter was founded in 1638 by Rev. John Wheelwright and his followers, who had been banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony to the south over religious differences. Its location on the Squamscott River soon developed as a shipbuilding and lumber shipment center, with the community center on the south bank and a primarily residential area on the north bank. Its oldest surviving structure, the Gilman Garrison House, was built c. 1700, and is one of a small number of sawn-log garrison houses to survive. It is now a museum operated by Historic New England. In 1827 a mill complex was established on the river bank, and mill worker housing arose on the north bank, in the Pleasant Street area. After a series of fires in the mid-19th century the brick-built section of Water Street was developed, giving the downtown area much of its present character. The \\"upper\\" portion of Water and High streets, south of the fire district, has retained more of its early 19th- century character, with wood-frame residential and commercial buildings. One early surviving industrial building is the Gilman grist mill, located on Kimball Island in the river.

In the language of Bugis it is called Mallogo and in the language of Makassar it is called Allogo. The name means honesty and sportsmanship. In the past mallogo was played by all the people of South Sulawesi, both commoners and nobles. The two groups used differing types of logos. The common people used a coconut shell while the nobility used logo of water buffalo , zinc , or gold-plated iron for the nobility. The game is played by two or more people, usually at the edge of a rice field. Each team selects a sweepstakes or maccede. The lucky team shoots first (MaLLio-lio) aimed at a logo that is set up at a distance of 2 meters. Each participant has the right to shoot up to 3 times, but if none of the shots hit the target, then the player is deemed void. Hitting the target, allows the player to shoot up the last goal.

There are clubs in cities and towns, and roller skating is taught in some schools of urban areas. Structure Roller sports in India are governed by the Roller Skating Federation of India, which was founded by S.P.Mumick in 1955. Tulsi Agarwal has been a long time office bearer of the federation. Individual skaters are registered with a club. The clubs are registered with district associations, which are in turn affiliated with the state associations. The state associations are affiliated with the RSFI. Disciplines Speed skating, artistic skating, and roller hockey are the three types of roller sports that are common in India. Roller hockey is more popular in the north of India as compared to south India. The popularity of roller hockey is in part due to the popularity of field hockey, which is the country's national sport. Similarly, 'roller basketball' and 'roller cricket' is also played in parts of the country. Important venues The roller skating rink at The Rink Pavilion in Mussoorie is one of the largest and most historic rinks in India. India's first international-standard banked track is at the roller sports centre in Virar, Mumbai. The 50th National Speed Roller Skating Championships were held here in January 2013. Another banked track is at the D.A.V. Public School in Faridabad. A banked-track of international standards also been made at Viman Nagar , Pune , Maharashtra. Achievements In the 2010 Asian Games, Anup Kumar Yama came won bronze in the men's single free skating long programme.

Technically, a theory is said to be a limiting case of another, later theory when and if the later theory subsumes the theoretical relations and apparent referents of the earlier one. For example, physicists agree that classical mechanics constitutes a low-energy limiting case of relativity theory.Rivadulla, Andres: The Newtonian Limit of Relativity Theory and the Rationality of Theory Change, Synthese 141:417‚Äì429, 2004.Ladyman, James (2013): \\"Toward a Demarcation of Science from Pseudoscience\\", in Philosophy of Pseudoscience, Chicago-London: The University of Chicago Press, p. 51. In words of Larry Laudan, realist philosophers use this phrase in the sense that the theory \\"T1 can be a limiting case of [the theory] T2 only if (a) all the variables (observable and theoretical) assigned a value in T1 are assigned a value by T2 and (b) the values assigned to every variable of T1 are the same as, or very close to, the values T2 assigns to the corresponding variable when certain initial and boundary conditions‚Äîconsistent with T2‚Äîare specified\\". The idea that a theory (in our previous example, Newtonian mechanics) that is close to being true (i.e., that is verisimil) converges as a limiting case into a superior theory (in this example, relativistic mechanics) can be an argument for scientific realism, as the theoretical entities postulated by the previous theories are still considered existent (if one assumes semantic realism, they are considered existent because they are referred to) in the successor theories.

Built in 1879, this three-story brick building is the largest Victorian-era building standing in the city. It occupies the city block between Fleet Street and Vaughan Mall, a former street that is now a pedestrian mall. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Franklin Block is located in downtown Portsmouth, one block west of the city's central Market Square, on the north side of Congress Street at Fleet Street. It is a three- story brick structure, built in a U shape. The main facade, facing Congress Street, is lined with commercial storefronts on the ground floor, separated by brick piers, with the main building entrance near the center, framed by fluted stone pilasters. Second-floor windows are grouped in fours, the outer windows of each group set in segmented-arch openings, and the center two set in rectangular openings topped as a pair by a rounded arch of brick and stone. On the third floor, windows are either singly or in pairs in rounded-arch openings, also formed out of brick and stone. Brick corbelling rises to a shallow parapet at the top of the facade. The building was designed in 1879 by Boston architect Arthur H. Vinal for Alfred Stavers, a local merchant, and is believed to be the oldest surviving design by Vinal. Built to replace a previous Franklin Hall destroyed by fire, it housed retail spaces facing Congress Street, and meeting halls and performance spaces in the upper floors. These latter spaces were converted to offices c. 1902, but some of the details of the theater interiors have survived. The block was built as part of a gradual westward expansion of the city's downtown in the late 19th century.

He was head of the sculpture department of Saint Martin's School of Art from 1952 to 1979. He brought young and forward-thinking sculptors into the department to teach, among them Anthony Caro, Robert Clatworthy, Elizabeth Frink and Eduardo Paolozzi. They and those round them came to be known as the New Generation of British sculptors. In the 1960s and 1970s the sculpture department at Saint Martin's was, in the words of Tim Scott: \\"the most famous in the art world\\". Life Frank Graeme Martin was born in Portsmouth, Hampshire, on 27 December 1914. He studied at Portsmouth Art School, and moved to London where he worked as an artist's model. He also worked as a sculptor's assistant, first to Charles Wheeler, later president of the Royal Academy, and then, for about two years until the outbreak of war, for William McMillan, for whom he also sat. During the Second World War Martin was a Royal Marine. After the war he studied part-time at the Royal Academy Schools. In 1946 or 1947 he began teaching clay modelling at Saint Martin's, and soon after was asked to set up a sculpture department. Martin died of cancer at his home in Clacton- on-Sea on 19 January 2004.

He was educated at the Midhurst grammar school, witnessing while there the destruction by fire of Cowdray House. Two years after that disaster he was with Thew, the engraver, at Northaw, Hertfordshire, where, when sufficiently proficient, he worked with Scriven and others on the Boydell- Shakespeare plates. Travels In 1800 he went to the Cape of Good Hope; his ship, outsailed by the convoy, successfully resisting on the voyage an attack by a French privateer. At Cape Town and in excursions up the country he made numerous drawings (Caffres, Hottentots, &c.;), resembling Catlin's later American pictures. From the Cape he passed to Philadelphia, where he engraved a number of book illustrations (‚ÄòJohnson's Poets,‚Äô ‚ÄòBradford's British Classics,‚Äô &c.;) and some portraits (Drs.

This construction, together with the Clebsch‚ÄìGordan procedure, can be used to generate additional irreducible representations if one already knows a few.  Definition  =Group representations= If V_1, V_2 are linear representations of a group G, then their tensor product is the tensor product of vector spaces V_1 \\\\otimes V_2 with the linear action of G uniquely determined by the condition that :g \\\\cdot (v_1 \\\\otimes v_2) = (g\\\\cdot v_1) \\\\otimes (g\\\\cdot v_2) for all v_1\\\\in V_1 and v_2\\\\in V_2. Although not every element of V_1\\\\otimes V_2 is expressible in the form v_1\\\\otimes v_2, the universal property of the tensor product operation guarantees that this action is well defined. In the language of homomorphisms, if the actions of G on V_1 and V_2 are given by homomorphisms \\\\Pi_1:G\\\\rightarrow\\\\operatorname{GL}(V_1) and \\\\Pi_2:G\\\\rightarrow\\\\operatorname{GL}(V_2), then the tensor product representation is given by the homomorphism \\\\Pi_1\\\\otimes\\\\Pi_2:G\\\\rightarrow\\\\operatorname{GL}(V_1\\\\otimes V_2) given by :\\\\Pi_1\\\\otimes\\\\Pi_2(g)=\\\\Pi_1(g)\\\\otimes\\\\Pi_2(g), where \\\\Pi_1(g)\\\\otimes\\\\Pi_2(g) is the tensor product of linear maps. Section 4.3.2 One can extend the notion of tensor products to any finite number of representations. If V is a linear representation of a group G, then with the above linear action, the tensor algebra T(V) is an algebraic representation of G; i.e., each element of G acts as an algebra automorphism. =Lie algebra representations= If (V_1,\\\\pi_1) and (V_2,\\\\pi_2) are representations of a Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g, then the tensor product of these representations is given by the map \\\\pi_1\\\\otimes\\\\pi_2:\\\\mathfrak g\\\\rightarrow\\\\operatorname{End}(V_1\\\\otimes V_2) given by Definition 4.19 :\\\\pi_1\\\\otimes\\\\pi_2(X)=\\\\pi_1(X)\\\\otimes I+I\\\\otimes\\\\pi_2(X). The motivation for this definition comes from the case in which \\\\pi_1 and \\\\pi_2 come from representations \\\\Pi_1 and \\\\Pi_2 of a Lie group G. In that case, a simple computation shows that the Lie algebra representation associated to \\\\Pi_1\\\\otimes\\\\Pi_2 is given by the preceding formula. Proposition 4.18  Action on linear maps  If (V_1,\\\\Pi_1) and (V_2,\\\\Pi_2) are representations of a group G, let \\\\operatorname{Hom}(V_1,V_2) denote the space of all linear maps from V_1 to V_2. Then \\\\operatorname{Hom}(V_1,V_2) can be given the structure of a representation by defining :g\\\\cdot A=\\\\Pi_2(g)A\\\\Pi_1(g)^{-1} for all A\\\\in\\\\operatorname{Hom}(V,W). Now, there is a natural isomorphism :\\\\operatorname{Hom}(V, W)\\\\cong V^* \\\\otimes W as vector spaces; this vector space isomorphism is in fact an isomorphism of representations. pp. 433‚Äì434 The trivial subrepresentation \\\\operatorname{Hom}(V, W)^G consists of G-linear maps; i.e., :\\\\operatorname{Hom}_G(V, W) = \\\\operatorname{Hom}(V, W)^G. Let E = \\\\operatorname{End}(V) denote the endomorphism algebra of V and let A denote the subalgebra of E^{\\\\otimes m} consisting of symmetric tensors. The main theorem of invariant theory states that A is semisimple when the characteristic of the base field is zero. Clebsch‚ÄìGordan theory =The general problem= The tensor product of two irreducible representations V_1,V_2 of a group or Lie algebra is usually not irreducible. It is therefore of interest to attempt to decompose V_1\\\\otimes V_2 into irreducible pieces. This decomposition problem is known as the Clebsch‚ÄìGordan problem. =The SU(2) case= The prototype example of this problem is the case of the rotation group SO(3)‚Äîor its double cover, the special unitary group SU(2). The irreducible representations of SU(2) are described by a parameter \\\\ell, whose possible values are :\\\\ell=0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, \\\\ldots. (The dimension of the representation is then 2\\\\ell+1.) Let us take two parameters \\\\ell and m with \\\\ell\\\\geq m. Then the tensor product representation V_\\\\ell\\\\otimes V_m then decomposes as follows: Theorem C.1 :V_\\\\ell\\\\otimes V_m\\\\cong V_{\\\\ell+m}\\\\oplus V_{\\\\ell+m-1}\\\\oplus\\\\cdots\\\\oplus V_{\\\\ell-m+1}\\\\oplus V_{\\\\ell-m}. Consider, as an example, the tensor product of the four-dimensional representation V_{3/2} and the three-dimensional representation V_1. The tensor product representation V_{3/2}\\\\otimes V_1 has dimension 12 and decomposes as :V_{3/2}\\\\otimes V_1\\\\cong V_{5/2}\\\\oplus V_{3/2}\\\\oplus V_{1/2}, where the representations on the right- hand side have dimension 6, 4, and 2, respectively. We may summarize this result arithmetically as 4\\\\times 3= 6+4+2. =The SU(3) case= In the case of the group SU(3), all the irreducible representations can be generated from the standard 3-dimensional representation and its dual, as follows. To generate the representation with label (m_1,m_2), one takes the tensor product of m_1 copies of the standard representation and m_2 copies of the dual of the standard representation, and then takes the invariant subspace generated by the tensor product of the highest weight vectors. Proof of Proposition 6.17 In contrast to the situation for SU(2), in the Clebsch‚ÄìGordan decomposition for SU(3), a given irreducible representation W may occur more than once in the decomposition of U\\\\otimes V.  Tensor power  As with vector spaces, one can define the th tensor power of a representation to be the vector space V^{\\\\otimes k} with the action given above. = The symmetric and alternating square = Over a field of characteristic zero, the symmetric and alternating squares are subrepresentations of the second tensor power. They can be used to define the Frobenius‚ÄìSchur indicator, which indicates whether a given irreducible character is real, complex, or quaternionic. They are examples of Schur functors. They are defined as follows. Let be a vector space. Define an endomorphism (self-map) of V\\\\otimes V as follows: : \\\\begin{align} T:V\\\\otimes V &\\\\longrightarrow V\\\\otimes V  v\\\\otimes w &\\\\longmapsto w\\\\otimes v. \\\\end{align} Precisely, we have V \\\\times V \\\\to V \\\\otimes V, (v, w) \\\\mapsto v \\\\otimes w, which is bilinear and thus descends to the linear map V \\\\otimes V \\\\to V \\\\otimes V. It is an involution (it is its own inverse), and so is an automorphism (self-isomorphism) of V\\\\otimes V. Define two subsets of the second tensor power of : : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{Sym}^2(V) &:= \\\\\\\\{v\\\\in V\\\\otimes V\\\\mid T(v)=v \\\\\\\\}  \\\\operatorname{Alt}^2(V) &:= \\\\\\\\{v\\\\in V\\\\otimes V\\\\mid T(v)=-v \\\\\\\\} \\\\end{align} These are the symmetric square of and the alternating square of , respectively. The symmetric and alternating squares are also known as the symmetric part and antisymmetric part of the tensor product.  Properties  The second tensor power of a linear representation of a group decomposes as the direct sum of the symmetric and alternating squares: : V^{\\\\otimes 2}=V\\\\otimes V \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Sym}^2(V) \\\\oplus \\\\operatorname{Alt}^2(V) as representations. In particular, both are subrepresenations of the second tensor power. In the language of modules over the group ring, the symmetric and alternating squares are \\\\mathbb{C}[G]-submodules of V\\\\otimes V. If has a basis \\\\\\\\{v_1,v_2,\\\\ldots,v_n\\\\\\\\}, then the symmetric square has a basis \\\\\\\\{v_i\\\\otimes v_j+v_j\\\\otimes v_i\\\\mid 1\\\\leq i\\\\leq j\\\\leq n\\\\\\\\} and the alternating square has a basis \\\\\\\\{v_i\\\\otimes v_j-v_j\\\\otimes v_i\\\\mid 1\\\\leq i. Accordingly, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\dim\\\\operatorname{Sym}^2(V) &= \\\\frac{\\\\dim V(\\\\dim V + 1)}{2},  \\\\dim\\\\operatorname{Alt}^2(V) &= \\\\frac{\\\\dim V(\\\\dim V - 1)}{2}. \\\\end{align} Let \\\\chi:G\\\\to\\\\mathbb{C} be the character of V. Then we can calculate the characters of the symmetric and alternating squares as follows: for all in , : \\\\begin{align} \\\\chi_{\\\\operatorname{Sym}^2(V)}(g) &= \\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\chi(g)^2+\\\\chi(g^2)),  \\\\chi_{\\\\operatorname{Alt}^2(V)}(g) &= \\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\chi(g)^2-\\\\chi(g^2)). \\\\end{align} = The symmetric and exterior powers = As in multilinear algebra, over a field of characteristic zero, one can more generally define the th symmetric power \\\\operatorname{Sym}^n(V) and th exterior power \\\\Lambda^n(V), which are subspaces of the th tensor power (see those pages for more detail on this construction). They are also subrepresentations, but higher tensor powers no longer decompose as their direct sum. The Schur‚ÄìWeyl duality computes the irreducible representations occurring in tensor powers of representations of the general linear group G = \\\\operatorname{GL}(V). Precisely, as an S_n \\\\times G-module :V^{\\\\otimes n} \\\\simeq \\\\bigoplus_\\\\lambda M_{\\\\lambda} \\\\otimes S^{\\\\lambda}(V) where *M_{\\\\lambda} is an irreducible representation of the symmetric group S_n corresponding to a partition \\\\lambda of n (in decreasing order), *S^{\\\\lambda}(V) is the image of the Young symmetrizer c_{\\\\lambda}: V^{\\\\otimes n} \\\\to V^{\\\\otimes n}. The mapping V \\\\mapsto S^{\\\\lambda}(V) is a functor called the Schur functor. It generalizes the constructions of symmetric and exterior powers: :S^{(n)}(V) = \\\\operatorname{Sym}^n V, \\\\,\\\\, S^{(1, 1, \\\\dots, 1)}(V) = \\\\wedge^n V. In particular, as an G-module, the above simplifies to :V^{\\\\otimes n} \\\\simeq \\\\bigoplus_{\\\\lambda} S^{\\\\lambda}(V)^{\\\\oplus m_{\\\\lambda}} where m_\\\\lambda = \\\\dim M_\\\\lambda. Moreover, the multiplicity m_{\\\\lambda} may be computed by the Frobenius formula (or the hook length formula). For example, take n = 3. Then there are exactly three partitions: 3 = 3 = 2 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 and, as it turns out, m_{(3)} = m_{(1, 1, 1)} = 1, \\\\, m_{(2, 1)} = 2. Hence, :V^{\\\\otimes 3} \\\\simeq \\\\operatorname{Sym}^3 V \\\\bigoplus \\\\wedge^3 V \\\\bigoplus S^{(2, 1)}(V)^{\\\\oplus 2}.  Tensor products involving Schur functors  Let S^{\\\\lambda} denote the Schur functor defined according to a partition \\\\lambda. Then there is the following decomposition: :S^{\\\\lambda} V \\\\otimes S^{\\\\mu} V \\\\simeq \\\\bigoplus_{ u} (S^{ u} V)^{\\\\oplus N_{\\\\lambda \\\\mu u}} where the multiplicities N_{\\\\lambda \\\\mu u} are given by the Littlewood‚ÄìRichardson rule. Given finite-dimensional vector spaces V, W, the Schur functors SŒª give the decomposition :\\\\operatorname{Sym}(W^* \\\\otimes V) \\\\simeq \\\\bigoplus_{\\\\lambda} S^{\\\\lambda}(W^*) \\\\otimes S^{\\\\lambda}(V) The left-hand side can be identified with the ring k[Hom(V, W)] = k[V * ‚äó W] of polynomial functions on Hom(V, W) and so the above also gives the decomposition of k[Hom(V, W)].  Tensor products representations as representations of product groups  Let G, H be two groups and let (\\\\pi,V) and (\\\\rho,W) be representations of G and H, respectively. Then we can let the direct product group G\\\\times H act on the tensor product space V\\\\otimes W by the formula :(g, h) \\\\cdot (v \\\\otimes w) = \\\\pi(g) v \\\\otimes \\\\rho(h) w. Even if G=H, we can still perform this construction, so that the tensor product of two representations of G could, alternatively, be viewed as a representation of G\\\\times G rather than a representation of G. It is therefore important to clarify whether the tensor product of two representations of G is being viewed as a representation of G or as a representation of G\\\\times G. In contrast to the Clebsch‚ÄìGordan problem discussed above, the tensor product of two irreducible representations of G is irreducible when viewed as a representation of the product group G\\\\times G.

After a short playing career, he became head coach at the BTT Tennis Academy in Barcelona, where he works with Sousa. Since January 2015, Marques is the Global Professional Tennis Coach Association president in Portugal. He is the youngest coach to have an athlete in the ATP top 100 ranking and the first Portuguese member of the ATP Coaches. In 2014, Marques was nominated for the 2014 Portuguese Coach of the Year award. Early life Marques was born in Lisbon, Portugal. His father, Jo√£o, is a managing director of an international company and his mother, Maria, is a housewife. He has an older brother, Jo√£o, who is bank manager. Marques started playing influenced by his father and his brother at age five. However, he began more serious practice only when he was 12. Marques pursued a degree in communication studies at Universidade Nova de Lisboa, but never finished, and he also attended at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain. In 2012, he did a Development and Performance Tennis Master in Madrid. Marques speaks Portuguese, Spanish, French and English. Marques is a football fan and his favorite club is S.L. Benfica. He also enjoys triathlons, watching films and spending time with friends. Had he not developed a career in tennis, he would have wanted to be a triathlete or a businessman. Tennis career =Player= At youth level, Marques was Under-14, Under-16 and Under-18 Portuguese 1. From 2000 to 2003, Marques practiced in the National Tennis Center in Oeiras, Portugal, where he was coached by Jo√£o Cunha e Silva and Bernardo Mota. He won the Under-16 National Championship mixed doubles tournament in 2001 and the singles and boys' doubles tournaments in 2002. In 2004, Marques moved to the BTT Tennis Academy in Barcelona to improve his game. During his first year there, Marques shared a rented house with his future coachee Jo√£o Sousa to reduce expenses. Marques made his main draw debut in 2001 in a junior tournament at the Taca Group Bowl in El Salvador, with Frederico Gil as his doubles partner. He played his final tournament at this level in August 2004, at the Vila do Conde Junior Tennis Cup. Marques won one singles and four doubles junior titles (including one with Gil and two with Eduardo Schwank) and reached the junior combined ranking world No. 80 in February 2004. Marques entered the professional circuit in 2002 at a Futures tournament in Lisbon. Though he lost all his three Futures doubles finals, he won a Satellite doubles tournament in Coimbra in 2004. Marques never entered the main draw of an ATP tour tournament, but he played the qualifying rounds of the Estoril Open in 2002, 2004 and 2005. Marques decided to retire as a professional player in 2009 when he realized he would not improve much further as a player and was becoming a financial burden for his parents. However, his final professional match would come later that year, at a Futures doubles tournament in Russia, where he partnered with his coachee Alexander Lobkov. He reached career-high doubles world No. 773 in 2005 and singles world no. 964 in 2006. =Coach= Immediately after retiring, Marques embarked on a coaching career at the BTT Tennis Academy despite not having previous experience as a coach. His first professional experience was alongside Russian Alexander Lobkov in 2009. After Lobkov won two out of three consecutive tournaments, Marques became his full-time coach from July 2009 to September 2010, a period in which Lobkov rose from world No 1001 to 359. The following season, Marques worked with Chinese Ma Yanan and supported the China Davis Cup team. Then Marques coached another Russian player, Vladislav Dubinsky, from May to October 2011. The relationship broke down due to Dubinsky's poker addiction. When Jo√£o Sousa began working with Marques in October 2011, he was world No. 220 and Marques had to convince the ATP to amend his contract so that a deal could be reached. Other players Marques coached for a short period include Teymuraz Gabashvili, Arnau Brugu√©s-Davi, √ç√±igo Cervantes, Steven Diez, James McGee, Denis Matsukevich, Valery Rudnev and Wu Di. In 2013, Marques was awarded the Record Portuguese Coach of the Year, and in November 2014, he was nominated for the 2014 Portuguese Coach of the Year award, losing to the Portugal national table tennis team coach Pedro Rufino. Other ventures When Marques ended his player career, he sought other options to remain physically active. Teased by Sousa, in 2013 he decided to prepare for Ironman Triathlon competitions when was weighing . In July 2014, he participated in his first Ironman in Z√ºrich. In August 2015, Marques successfully finished an Ultraman race in Canada, where he was the youngest participant at 29. Since 2014, Marques is sponsored by KTM, which helps him cover the logistics associated with touring alongside Sousa.

Despite launching three assaults, the Chetniks failed to capture Novi Pazar. During World War II, the territory of Sand≈æak was the subject of territorial disputes between Germany, Italy, as well as the local Bosniak and Albanian populations. Due to the multiple insurgent, ethnic and religious groups in the region, persecution and genocide of Serbs, Jews and Romani people characterised the conflict in Yugoslavia.  Background  = Axis invasion of Yugoslavia = The Axis invasion of Yugoslavia began on 6 April 1941 and within several days, it was conquered by Axis forces. On 17 April, German troops, the 60th Infantry Division and the 8th Panzer Division, captured the city of Novi Pazar. Yugoslavia was then partitioned between the Axis powers. On April 23, it was agreed that the city would fall within the German occupation zone. = Uprisings in Montenegro and Serbia = The Uprising in Montenegro occurred on 13 July 1941 and spread into areas of Sand≈æak. To prevent the uprising from spreading further, Italian forces used various Muslim irregular units from Sand≈æak, Metohija and Kosovo to intimidate and expel local Serbs, who were considered to be supporters of the movement. During the month, several groups spread disorder in regions surrounding the towns of Ro≈æaje, Plav, Gusinje, Tutin and Pe≈°ter. The situation in Novi Pazar was sensitive, as local Serbs were ruled over by Muslim governors. At the beginning of August 1941, many Serbs began resisting Muslim rule. On 27 October, an agreement was made to divide the region of Sand≈æak between Germany and Italy. However, Novi Pazar remained under German control, together with Kosovska Mitrovica and small area of the Sjenica municipality, Duga Poljana. Many armed conflicts between the Chetniks and Albanian-Muslim forces occurred during the period between October and December 1941, with a front being established between Ra≈°ka and Novi Pazar. Consequently, civilian villages were often destroyed by both sides. Between June and December 1941, 60 Serbs were killed and a further 144 imprisoned, and 2,016 Serb homes and 776 Muslim homes were destroyed in Novi Pazar. On 23 September, the Chetniks attacked Albanian forces on Rogozna mountain and captured it after a day-long battle. Conflict in the region between the two forces lasted until the end of September. At the end of October 1941, the Chetniks and the Partisan Kopaonik detachment agreed to attack Novi Pazar together. It was decided that the Chetniks were to attack Novi Pazar from the northern side while the Partisans were to attack from the southern side.  Forces  Germans followed their strategy to protect only points of vital importance during the uprising in Serbia. To protect the lead mine they moved their forces from Novi Pazar to Kosovska Mitrovica on 4 October. Germans armed units of Albanian Gendarmerie was left to protect the town. In period between 5 October and 7 December 1941 (when German forces returned to Novi Pazar) all Serbs in the town were forbidden to leave the town according to the order of Had≈æiahmetoviƒá, in order to prevent them to join Chetniks or to inform them about the forces in the town. On 7 October the first group of Albanian forces commanded by Shaban Polluzha came to Novi Pazar. Had≈æiahmetoviƒá emphasized that this group turned Serb populated Ibarski Kola≈°in into dust and ash. In October 1941 the total number of Albanian forces that came to Novi Pazar was around 500. Around 100 Muslim forces from Tutin and Sjenica with forces of Biko Dre≈°eviƒá also came to defend Novi Pazar.  Battle  = Early November attack on Novi Pazar = According to the agreed plan, two companies of the Kopaonik Partisan detachment under command of Sveta Trifunoviƒá took control over the road between Novi Pazar and Kosovska Mitrovica to prevent armed Albanian forces to use this road to reach the town. One Chetnik detachment joined them and burned some Muslim houses. Tomorrow, Muslim forces from Novi Pazar attacked Serb houses in Trnava and began to burn them. Partisans attacked them and forced them to retreat to Novi Pazar. Because of the split between Chetniks and Partisans Chetniks left their positions at joint Chetnik‚ÄîPartisan front at Kraljevo in the night between 3 and 4 November. This had direct consequence to Chetnik-Partisan cooperation at Novi Pazar where Partisan forces left their positions to fill the gap at Kraljevo. Chetniks attacked the town on 4 November at 4 a.m. They managed to advance toward the town until 7 a.m. when the rear flanks of one Chetnik unit were attacked by Muslim forces under command of Biko Dre≈°oviƒá, D≈æemail Koniƒçanin and Mullah Jakup. This caused dismay of this Chetnik unit which retreated from already captured positions. Muslim forces regrouped and pushed back the Chetnik forces who advanced on another part of front (Petrova Crkva ‚Äî ƒêurƒëevi Stupovi ‚Äî Parniƒçko brdo ‚Äî Vidovo). The Chetnik casualties were 83 killed and 48 wounded, while defending forces had 60 killed and 23 wounded. The defenders' success in the battle was celebrated in Novi Pazar, people waved Albanian flags and shouted glorifying Greater Albania. Armed bands killed dozens of Serbs in Novi Pazar in only a couple of hours. Dre≈°oviƒá's men carried cut off heads stuck on the bayonets of their rifles and threw them on the garbage. To prevent further killings Mulla Jakub proposed to imprison all Serbs older than 18 years. Ahmetoviƒá accepted this proposal with intention to use imprisoned Serbs as hostages in the future negotiations with Chetniks. = Attack on Ra≈°ka = To provide additional forces, arms and ammunition Had≈æiahmetoviƒá sent his men to neighboring regions of Yugoslavia annexed to Albania and Italy. Within a couple of days additional forces came to Novi Pazar, mostly from Kosovo, so the total number of armed men in Novi Pazar on 10 November 1941 was around 3,150. A number of guns, machine guns and ammunition was also brought into the town. This encouraged Had≈æiahmetoviƒá to try to expand borders of the Greater Albania by capturing Chetnik controlled Ra≈°ka. To buy some time Had≈æiahmetoviƒá concluded peace agreement with Chetniks on 10 November 1941. According to this agreement Muslims guaranteed safety to Serbs while Chetniks guaranteed safety to Muslims who lived on the territory under their control. During next couple of days additional Albanian and Muslim forces arrived to Novi Pazar. On 14 November Had≈æiahmetoviƒá had around 5,000 armed men and made decision to attack Ra≈°ka and burn all Serb villages in the region. On 15 November his forces began with burning of numerous Serb villages and killed many people. On 16 November at 10 a.m. Muslim and Albanian forces attacked Ra≈°ka. They quickly advanced toward the town. The situation for the defenders became very difficult, so Vojislav Lukaƒçeviƒá, the person of the biggest confidence of Mihailoviƒá, personally engaged in the defence of the town. Villagers from burned villages rallied and joined the defenders. On 17 November they stopped the advance of Had≈æiahmetoviƒá's forces and forced them to retreat. Attackers had 106 killed men while defenders had 34 killed men, without people killed during burning of the vatiillages. = Late November and early December attacks on Novi Pazar = Chetniks attacked Novi Pazar on 21 November 1941. Vojislav Lukaƒçeviƒá, one of the closest associates of Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá, participated in this attack. During this attack Chetniks burned all Muslim villages from Po≈æega to Vuƒçiniƒái. Chetniks failed to capture Novi Pazar and retreated suffering casualties of 42 killed men, while defenders had 26 killed. Both sides had around 45 wounded. On 5 December the last Chetnik attempt to capture Novi Pazar failed. Based on the false information that communists captured some parts of Novi Pazar, German forces returned to the town on 7 December 1941. The epilogue of struggle between Chetniks and Muslim and Albanian forces in the region of Novi Pazar was 447 killed people (287 Serbs, 136 Muslims and 144 Albanians). The victims of terror of the conflicting parties were 115 Serbs and 61 Muslims.

He was the grandson of Sir George Downing, 1st Baronet, namesake of Downing Street; and cousin and heir of Sir George Downing, 3rd Baronet, whose Gamlingay estate would eventually establish Downing College, Cambridge despite illegal attempts by Jacob and his widow to prevent the university from receiving the estate. Biography Downing was the oldest son of Charles Downing of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, and Sarah Garrard. He was named after his maternal grandfather, Jacob Garrard, who was son and heir of Sir Thomas Garrad, 2nd Baronet of Langford, but who died before his father and thus did not succeed as the third baronet. Jacob Downing had an older sister, Sarah, who died as a child before he was born. His father was comptroller of customs in Salem, Massachusetts, and became immensely wealthy, and Jacob inherited his father's wealth in 1740. Downing was a Member of Parliament for Dunwich from 1741 to 1747, from 1749 to 1761 and from 1763 to 1764. He was closely associated with Lord Hardwicke. In 1749, Downing inherited the baronetcy and Gamlingay estate in Cambridgeshire from his cousin Sir George Downing, 3rd Baronet. The next year, on 17 May 1750, Downing married Margaret Price, daughter of Rev. Price, curate at Barrington, Gloucestershire. They had no children. Downing estate Downing devoted himself to restoring his late cousin's lands, which were left in his hands in a poor state. Near the end of his life, Sir George Downing had failed to find tenants for vacant farms, and was losing ¬£1,500 a year () through his mismanagement. > Sir Jacob Downing took great pride in his land and slowly rehabilitated the > estate. Old buildings were repaired, new ones built and open land enclosed, > at a cost of around ¬£30,000. One of his first acts was to commission a > series of maps by Joseph Cole, showing the different farms which made up the > estate. However, as he grew older, Sir Jacob's thoughts obviously turned > increasingly to his lack of heir and what would happen after his death as > some new barns and buildings were put onto pattens, or rollers, perhaps so > that they could be moved off the entailed land by his wife after his death. Lady Margaret Downing, portrait by Thomas Gainsborough There were no children of the marriage, and the baronetcy became extinct in 1764, when he died at Hill Street, London. Per the third baronet's will, if Jacob Downing had no son, George Downing's estate was supposed to be used by the University of Cambridge to establish a college in his name. However, Jacob instead left the estates to his widow, which led to 40 years of litigation between Lady Margaret and the university. During this time, the estates were neglected and diminished considerably in value. Lady Margaret demolished Gamlingay Park house in 1776, \\"selling it brick by brick at auction for a fraction of its value.\\" After Downing died in 1764, in 1768, she married Admiral Sir George Bowyer, 5th Baronet, who in 1794 was created a baronet in his own right, several years after her death (18 September 1778). The legal fight for the third baronet's estates continued after her death, as she left them to her widower and a nephew. The legal battle continued until March 1800, when the university and Lady Margaret's heirs reached an agreement. However, during this time, the value of the estate was massively reduced to a fraction of what it had been. Only 10 per cent was recovered from the ¬£100,000 () owed to the estate in rents. Even though the charter for the new college was finally granted in September 1800, it was not until 1806 that the first building went up, and a further 16 years passed before the first Downing College students began their studies‚Äî56 years after the death of Sir Jacob Downing.

Today the company is part of the Ruia Group which comprises a number of companies that import, supply and distribute textiles and hosiery to retailers and hospitality organisations. Richard Haworth Ltd. supplies a range of linens to the hospitality sector. History Richard Haworth and Co was founded in c.1854. Richard Haworth, with Frederick Copley Hulton and James Craven, worked in partnership to begin trading as yarn and cloth commission agents in Cannon Street, Manchester. The partners then established a small weaving shed in Mount Street until, following a growth in demand, they expanded into spinning and leased a large mill at Broughton Bridge. The company continued to prosper and expand, and by 1872 was working out of three large mills and weaving sheds; Egyptian Mill (1864), Tatton Mill (1870) and Ordsall Mill (1872). By 1900 the mills covered 13 acres and 150,000 spindles produced thread for 4,000 looms. The annual output for cloth reached 30,000,000 yards and the workforce reached 4000. When Richard Haworth died in 1883, and his two partners shortly after in 1886, Richard Haworth's sons, G and J Haworth, were left with total responsibility for the firm. The company continued to thrive, converting to a limited liability company and, at its peak being considered first class example of how cotton mills should be operated. \\"The mills of the firm, erected in various quarters of the city, are celebrated, not alone for their extent, but for the remarkable excellence of their arrangements and for the perfection of their machinery. Extraordinary provision is made in them for the physical comfort, the mental improvement, and the social recreation of the workpeople, in whom Mr. Haworth always evinced the warmest personal interest.\\" Manchester Guardian 1883 In 1951 Richard Haworth and Co Ltd was advertised for sale. It had grown from a cotton spinning a weaving firm to one offering a whole range of cotton and reyon fabrics under the trademark 'Spero'. By this time the company were working out of a large head office in Manchester and the Ordsall and Tatton mills and weaving sheds, a third location having been destroyed during the Manchester blitz in 1940. According to records held at Companies Office Manchester, Richard Haworth Ltd was purchased by Vantona textiles in 1953, and the Title 'Richard Haworth' subsequently purchased by the Ruia Group. The company, Richard Haworth, continues to manufacture and distribute textiles out of Kearsley Mill in Greater Manchester.  Richard Haworth (1820‚Äì1883)  Born in March 1820, Richard was the youngest of eight children of George Haworth and his wife. He attended school until, at the age of seven, his father died and by the age of thirteen he secured a full-time job at Messrs Openshaw & Co of Bury, spinners and fustian manufacturers. One day whilst brushing a loom he injured his hand badly when it became caught in the machinery. To some extent this changed the course of his life.Manchester Guardian, (3 Dec 1883) Obituaries of Richard Haworth (1820‚Äì1883) He later took a job as a weft lad and utilised his spare hours by attending a night school. He continued to attend night school, showing an aptitude for mathematics and was transferred to the mill's basic accounts. According to records held in the national archives, when Haworth was eighteen he left to become a bookkeeper at Rylands Mill, Ainsworth, and later in 1843 became the official bookkeeper. During this time he had been developing his own business and decided to devote his time to his own business. His company and mills were recognised for their excellence and in addition to providing employment for thousands of mill workers and workplaces that placed an emphasis on safety, Richard Haworth felt it important to contribute to his local community and had a strong connection to the Wesleyan Methodist body. \\"He took an active part in the lay home mission, assisting in the conduct of its services in Angel Meadow and in other of the poorest and most neglected parts of the town. He did a great deal to promote education amongst the middle class of Wesleyans by the establishment of boarding schools at Colwyn Bay and Rhyl.\\" - Manchester Guardian, Obituaries of Richard Haworth 1883 Other achievements and public posts included Treasurer of the Hospital Sunday Fund, Chairman of the Equitable Fire Insurance Company, of which he was one of the original promoters, Chairman of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Accident Insurance Society, Treasurer of the Sunday Closing Fund, Justice of the peace for Manchester, Member of the Withington Local Board, Member of the first School Board in Manchester and Member of the Board of Management of the Royal Infirmary. Richard Haworth married Sarah Sewell in 1839 with whom he had six children; two girls and four boys. One of his sons became a Wesleyan minister at Teddington, Surrey; the other three, Messrs. George Chester Haworth, John Fletcher Haworth, and Fred Haworth, became active partners in the firm of Richard Haworth and Co and took responsibility for the company when Richard Haworth died at the age of 63, in 1883. Cultural context Manchester and Lancashire mills became the largest, most productive cotton spinning centre in the world, responsible for 32% of global cotton production in 1871.Williams, M. Farnie, D. (1992) Cotton Mills in Greater Manchester. Preston: Carnegie ltd, p. 14 In 1853, the number of cotton mills in Manchester peaked at 108.Manchester City Council, (retrieved 12 April 2007) \\"City Centre\\", Spinning the Web As the industrial centre began to decline, mills opened up in the surrounding towns of Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, and Bolton. This flourishing cotton manufacturing community came to be referred to as \\"Cottonopolis\\".Partridge, Eric. Beale, Paul. (2002), A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English (8 ed.), Routledge, p. 258 The British cotton industry reached its peak in 1912, producing eight billion yards of cloth. However, the war of 1914 had an enormous impact on Britain's staple industries; cotton could no longer be exported to foreign markets and, particularly in Japan, countries began to build their own factories. Soon, Japan introduced 24-hour cotton production and by 1933, became the world's largest cotton manufacturer. The demand for British cotton slumped and during this period 800 mills closed. Despite these fluctuating patterns of manufacturing and trade, the company Richard Haworth built in the 1800s grew to a workforce of 4000 with an annual output of 30,000,000 yards of cloth, surviving until its sale in 1951. Legacy Haworth's impact on the local area and importance in local history was recognised in 2012 by the Working Class Movement Library in Salford. With Lottery funding, the library launched their \\"Invisible Histories\\" project, investigating the realities of people's working lives during the period that Salford was an industrial powerhouse in the northwest. The research focusses on 3 historical workplaces, Agecroft Colliery, Ward & Goldstone and Richard Haworth's cotton mill. The study focuses on the Ordsall Lane mill which closed in the 1970s, and acknowledges the companies continued production of textiles. Several individuals who worked at, or had a connection with Richard Hawort's mills gave interviews which described their working experiences at this leading cotton company. Peter Downing, who was interviewed by the 'Invisible Histories: Salford's Working Lives' team, worked as an apprentice joiner in Richard Haworth's mills and described Ordsall Lane mill as \\"A busy, busy mill\\" with \\"2000 workers there, maybe more, every room fully manned\\". He described it as \\"A great working environment, full of life... friendly and sociable\\".  References  Bibliography * Williams, M. Farnie, D. (1992) Cotton Mills in Greater Manchester.

Life Hwanjile was an Aja woman from the village of Home in an area west of Abomey, in the southern portion of modern-day Benin. She was reportedly already an adult with two children when she was brought, either as a war captive or trader, to the palace of Abomey. Hwanjile was married to the king Agaja before she was appointed to the position of kpojito (\\"Mother of the Leopard\\") by Tegbesu, the fourth king of Dahomey. Her kin included the powerful Adanle, Hodonour, and Kossou-Naeton families of merchants in the town of Ouidah. Political and religious involvement The oral histories which are our chief source of information about eighteenth-century Dahomey do not explain why Hwanjile allied herself with Tegbesu, but they do state that Hwanjile played a pivotal role in Tegbesu's accession to the throne, displacing his older brother. As a result of this assistance, Tegbesu named Hwanjile kpojito, a position which made her the richest and most powerful woman in the kingdom. This term is often translated as \\"queen mother\\" in English, though this is not entirely accurate. To be kpojito was to be a female \\"reign mate\\" of a king through an either literal or symbolic mother-son relationship, representative of a balancing of royal power, and to possess the authority to resolve religious disputes. Hwanjile solidified her and Tegbesu's rule through manipulation of religious beliefs, particularly those centered on the Dahomean vodun or gods. She imported two creator gods, Mawu and Lisa, from Aja and proclaimed them the rulers of the Dahomean pantheon. Hwanjile established a home for them directly outside the royal palace, where she served as their powerful high priest. She also encouraged the use of fa divination. Legacy Due to the key role which she played in creating a strong, centralised kingdom in less than a generation, Hwanjile is considered one of the most important figures in the history of Dahomey, and indeed of modern-day Benin. Following Hwanjile's death, she was replaced by a direct descendant who took on her name and her functions. This system of perpetual succession still continues, and successive Hwanjile have continued to be politically powerful. In addition, a number of the gods introduced by Hwanjile are worshipped today in Benin. References Further reading *Edna G.

It's a largely Romanesque church and its main construction period was at the end of the 12th century. The church is part of the Diocese of Visby within the Church of Sweden.  History and architecture  View of the interior towards the choir Akeb√§ck Church was constructed of plastered limestone and is, with the exception of the sacristy, a completely Romanesque church. Most of the building was done at the end of the 12th century, with the tower added during the mid-13th century. The church was inaugurated in 1149. Only the sacristy is considerably later, from 1931. The church has an almost square choir, a semi-circular apse and a rectangular nave. It has a simple interior. Notable are the original ceramic pots which have been immured in the vault of the church, as a way to improve the acoustics. Another unusual detail is a stone sculpture depicting a stonemason lying down which is immured in the church portal. According to tradition, it was made in memory of one of the men who worked at the church but fell and died during the construction; scholars have suggested that it may on the other hand simply be a stone that was placed in the wrong direction with the picture lying down instead of standing up. Among the furnishings, the altar is unusual in that while it is from the 17th century, the crucifix in the middle is a re-used medieval cross, from the 15th century. The baptismal font is from the 13th century. Of later date is a chandelier, donated in 1850 by a carpenter as a votive gift, \\"in thanks to divine providence, that kept him safe during fourteen years abroad\\". The smaller of the two church bells was donated in 1993. The church underwent a renovation in 1931‚Äì32 under a proposal by architect Sven Brandel (1886‚Äì1931). During the renovation, a large picture stone was found immured in the church. It was extracted and is now displayed outside the church.

It opened on May 23, 2013. With an epoxy gravel placed over the street, it contains granite blocks, red chairs, tables, and potted plants. Its construction was delayed for several years and debated within Manhattan Community Board 1, although it was ultimately approved by the executive committee. The Alliance for Downtown New York, the Business Improvement District led by Elizabeth H. Berger, argued that the plaza would, according to the Downtown Express, \\"improve pedestrian mobility\\" around the September 11 Memorial and allow the Alliance to install a tourist kiosk. Referring to the Alliance's report \\"Five Principles for Greenwich South,\\" which advocated for the plaza, she said: ‚ÄúOne of the things that we looked at was how to capitalize on the old-world geometry of the street plan to create a sense of destination and gathering places.... There‚Äôll be an attractive space not only for visitors but for people who live and work in the area to congregate.‚Äù Some residents believed, however, that \\"it would disrupt traffic and complicate an already crowded area.\\" The administration of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, through Jeffrey Mandel, an adviser to Deputy Mayor Robert K. Steel, also advanced that the plaza would benefit residents of the Downtown neighborhood while helping to mitigate foot traffic from tourists. He said, \\"[the plaza] pushes a couple of big dominos forward by creating a place that's not just attractive and desirable for the folks down here but that has beneficial impacts in the way of mitigation.\\" The plaza's construction was delayed by Hurricane Sandy. Representing the exiting Bloomberg administration, Mandel said, \\"We think it's important to make our best efforts in our last hours in the neighborhood.\\" Activists for the recognition of the history of the Lower West Side and the Little Syria neighborhood have argued that the plaza would be an ideal place for historical signage. In anticipation of its construction, they pursued a resolution in support of signage from Community Board 1.

Dulmers is known for his years of reporting from the former Yugoslavia during the Yugoslav Wars, during which he was arrested and interrogated. He has written several books, one based on his experiences in the former Yugoslavia and another, on Pope John Paul II's succession, based on years he spent studying for the priesthood in Rome. Dulmers mostly works freelance and has built a reputation as a single-minded and somewhat eccentric writer, difficult to work with but highly praised by his colleagues. Biography RSK militia and UNPROFOR personnel at an RSK roadblock near Vukovar on the Brotherhood and Unity Highway, 1992 Dulmers worked freelance in 1981‚Äì1982 for the VPRO's news program BGTV, and wrote a series of articles for Vrij Nederland with Frits Abrahams. He studied philosophy at the Universiteit van Amsterdam, and in September 1991 left for Graz to study with the Jesuits for a year. From Graz he traveled to Croatia, where the Yugoslav Civil War had just broken out, and reported for Dutch radio from East Slavonia. In the following years he reported from and lived in Osijek, Zagreb, Split and Sarajevo, working freelance for the ANP, the largest Dutch press agency. Dulmers was arrested on 19 May 1992 in Doboj, Bosnia and Herzegovina, by a Serbian militia while traveling with one of the UNHCR food convoys, and charged with espionage. He was released on 29 May after intervention by the Red Cross, after \\"reportedly [being] beaten and threatened with execution\\". As a result of his experiences Dulmers was able to testify against Serbian militia leader Nikola Jorgic, who was sentenced to life in prison for genocide in 1997.Rapport strafzaak Jorgic (blz. 73‚Äì75) Dulmers' colleague, photographer Teun Voeten, had stayed with him in Osijek, Croatia, while the town was being shelled by Serb forces in October 1991, and described how Dulmers, who knew everyone in town, walked around the ruins with a long black leather coat covering a tuxedo, and slept in the basement of the local clergy house among the pickles. Voeten commented that he and Dulmers crossed paths frequently in years to come: they often disagreed and usually fought, but, he said, Dulmers had a \\"brilliant mind and a tender soul\\". Reviewing Zwart (\\"Black\\"), Dulmers' autobiographical novel based on his experiences in former Yugoslavia, Voeten called it \\"an impressive and, as far as I know, unique book for Dutch literature: a philosophical confessional novel with homo-erotic subtext, Bildungsroman and ruthless war reporting at the same time\\". =After Yugoslavia= In the late 1990s Dulmers worked, still as a freelance writer, for a number of Dutch publications including again Vrij Nederland, which fired him in 1999 after he was charged with plagiarism: one paragraph (five sentences) in a long article on safe sex was copied from the Internet. The magazine's editor-in-chief commented that everything else in the article checked out, and that he couldn't understand why Dulmers had copied the \\"unnecessary\\" paragraph. In the same magazine, Dutch writer Natasha Gerson commented on Dulmers, after comparing him with notorious and unconventional writers such as Gerard Reve and Charles Bukowski, \\"Dulmers is of that type whose passing people lament, and wonder why such people are no longer around, when the answer is clear: our world, today, does not tolerate brilliant and curious ‚Äì and enervating ‚Äì individuals such as him\\". His years in former Yugoslavia had brought Dulmers to \\"the edge of insanity\\", and in 1998 he decided to study theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University, Rome, to become a priest. He did not, in the end, become one, but used his experience in the Vatican to write a book on the final years of Pope John Paul II and the process of electing a new pope, Wachten op witte rook: De opvolging van Johannes Paulus II (\\"Waiting for white smoke: the succession of John Paul II\\", 2004). Dulmers reported in 2009 on the trial of former Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karad≈æiƒá. In 2014, Dulmers went to Syria with Teun Voeten, in hopes of an interview with president Bashar al-Assad. They did not interview Assad but were allowed to visit for coffee (having brought Pierre Marcolini bonbons for Mrs. Assad), and published their report in De Groene Amsterdammer. Dulmers commented afterward that in war journalism it is frequently impossible to report on both sides: \\"If they [the rebels] find out that I visited at the presidential office, then I'm finished\\".

He lives and works in London and has exhibited internationally since 1998.  Life and career  Riddy started taking and printing photographs at the age of 14 and earned a BA and MA in Fine Art at Chelsea School of Art (1980‚Äì84). Since his first solo exhibition in 1993 Riddy has consistently worked in series, with an emphasis on considered description. Architecture, the particularities of place and the urban environment have been constant subjects, whilst the starting point for many of his series has been the relationship between photography and the history of art and architecture. Typical examples are the autobiography of John Ruskin, the woodblock prints of Hokusai and the photographs of Gustave le Gray. Choices about format, materials and technique have been intrinsic to each series and Riddy‚Äôs focus has been on the exhibited print.  Exhibitions  In 1993 Riddy had his first solo exhibition with the Cairn Gallery. Shortly afterwards he started working with Frith Street Gallery who continue to represent him. His first survey exhibition was at Camden Arts Centre in 2000 and he showed his series Views from Shin-Fuji at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2006. He has exhibited regularly with Galerie Paul Andriesse in the Netherlands and Lawrence Markey in the USA. His exhibition Palermo at Frith Street gallery in 2013 was reviewed by theguardian.com and Aesthetica Magazine. Aesthetica described the photographs as \\"anything but spontaneous. Physical decay of the urban landscape is juxtaposed with a remarkable formal beauty just as, in a more conceptual sense, time and timelessness contend with each other in these works\\".

It is said falsely to be designed by Alexandre-Gustave Eiffel in 1884, and built in 1887. First shown at the 1889 Exposition Universelle of Paris, France, it was moved to Brussels, where it was acquired by the Boleo Mining Company who installed it in Santa Rosalia in late 1897. Architecture Interior view It was built entirely of stamped steel sheet squares, and is supported by a formidable steel structure in a sober and austere style. It was later modified in favor of functionality, its former lateral corridors were turned into habitable space using crude masonry, and the building was stripped of several of its original stained glasses. Despite these modifications, it still preserves some of the original 1880s design. History Exterior view of the church's windows and plaque Tradition credited its design is due to the architect, Eiffel, that it was shown in the 1889 Exposition Universelle, and that it was awarded a prize. It was destined for re-construction in Africa, but was found disassembled in Belgium by Charles Laforgue, the director of the Compagnie du Boleo at Santa Rosal√≠a's Boleo mine, who bought it in 1894 and had it installed in Santa Rosal√≠a three years later. In the early 1990s American architectural student Angela Gardner visited Santa Rosal√≠a and examined the church. She formed a hypothesis that the church design was from the french architect Bibiano Duclos (1853‚Äì1925) rather than Eiffel's firm. with no historical record or blueprint, neither version is confirmed.

Originally owned by the Crown, since 1798 the estate has belonged to the Scavenius family. In 1838, a three-winged stone complex was built by G.F. Hetsch in the Neoclassical style and in 1875, a new manor house designed by August Klein in the Renaissance Revival style was completed but it was demolished in 2000. History Klintholm in 1861 Until 1769, the area was part of the Crown estate of H√∏jem√∏n. As far as can be seen from surviving records, a merchant from Stubbek√∏bing by the name of Ditlev Staal bought the estate in 1774 and constructed the first buildings between 1778 and 1780. They included a dairy, long and wide. It was around this period that the name Klintholm appeared for the first time. Until then, the estate had been known as Klintegodset (the cliff estate). Staal maintained ownership for only 10 years until his death in 1797. In June 1798, Jacob Br√∏nnum Scavenius bought the property. thumb Jacob Scavenius purchased numerous properties in the surroundings, extending the estate to an area of some . In 1819, all the Klintholm buildings were destroyed by fire but were quickly reconstructed in 1820. The new complex included a brick factory and a limestone plant. The estate was efficiently run for several generations. Carl Sophus Scavenius who found the main building too small for his wife and 10 children, built a grandiose new manor in 1875. He also developed the harbour village of Klintholm Havn which served to transport the estate's products. In 1945, the estate came into the hands of Carl Christian Scavenius. He managed it with great enthusiasm, acquiring Denmark's first herd of Hereford cattle. He also encouraged tourism by setting up the M√∏ns Klint Camping and the √Ölekroen, a restaurant in Klinthom Havn. New manor house The manor house built in 1873 was known as Kammerherreboligen. It was designed by August Klein in the so-called Rosenborg style, a Renaissance variant based on the architecture of Rosenborg Castle. With its tower, its projecting lateral wings, its mansard roof, Dutch gables, large windows and sculpted limestone decorations, the grandiose building fully reflected the Historicist trends of the times. Inside, the main entrance below the tower led into a large vaulted hall with rich stucco decorations, similar those in the other ground floor rooms with their fine parquet floors. The library was particularly impressive with its carved shelving. The decorations were the work of Adolph Hellesen (1831‚Äì1890). Dry rot first began to appear in the building in the 1940s. After the family moved out in 1964, it spread more quickly. In 1983, many of the furnishings and artefacts were auctioned off. Judged unsafe by the authorities, the building was demolished in the spring of 2000.

Kearney (born August 5, 1962) is a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Biography Kearney received a Bachelor of Arts degree, cum laude, in 1984 from Villanova University. He received a Juris Doctor in 1987 from Villanova University School of Law. From 1987 to 1988, he served as a law clerk to Vice Chancellor Maurice A. Hartnett III of the Delaware Court of Chancery. He served as an associate at the law firm of Elliott, Mannino & Flaherty, P.C., from 1988 to 1990. From 1990 to 2014, he served at the law firm of Elliott, Greenleaf & Siedzikowski, P.C., in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, serving as a shareholder from 1995 to 2014. He handled complex commercial litigation before both Federal and State courts. He served as the 2009 President of the Montgomery Bar Association (Pennsylvania) as it celebrated 125 years of service and as the 2014-15 President of the Pennsylvania Bar Institute (the largest CLE provider on Pennsylvania law) as it recognized 50 years of providing continuing legal education. He was repeatedly recognized as Top 50 litigation star in Pennsylvania by Benchmark Litigation and received the honor of \\"Trial Lawyer of the Year\\" while in practice. He is a member of the Villanova Law School's Board of Consultors. Federal judicial service On June 16, 2014, President Obama nominated Kearney to serve as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, to the seat vacated by Judge J. Curtis Joyner, who took senior status on May 1, 2013. On July 24, 2014 a hearing before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary was held on his nomination. On September 18, 2014 his nomination was reported out of committee by voice vote. On December 1, 2014 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid filed for cloture on his nomination. On Wednesday December 3, 2014 cloture was invoked by a vote of 60‚Äì36. He was later confirmed by voice vote that same day. He received his judicial commission on December 4, 2014. Notable cases On February 19, 2016, Judge Kearney issued a ruling in which he held that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution does not protect the right of citizens to film police activity in a public area. One commentator opined this ruling is contrary to a consistent line of cases at the Federal and State level. Kearney explained the governing law in his Third Circuit did not allow him - as a trial judge - to recognize this new constitutional claim in the exceptionally narrow facts presented in the case. In July 2017, United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit Judge Thomas L. Ambro, joined by Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo and partially by Judge Richard Lowell Nygaard, reversed Kearney's judgment but granted qualified immunity to the police officers involved.. Kearney also granted injunctions prohibiting state actors from treating female low risk inmates significantly different than male low risk inmates under the Equal Protection Clause and to stop Pennsylvania from interfering with the ongoing construction of the Scudder Falls Bridge in Bucks County under the Compact Clause. In 2016, the court of appeals designated Kearney to hear over 70 cases in the Western District of Pennsylvania and in 2017, over 50 cases in the District of Delaware. Kearney has held businesses accountable for not being licensed to collect debt from a borrower under the Pennsylvania Consumer Credit Code and reviewed false advertisement claims against the Morgan and Morgan law firm's legal marketing strategy allegedly confusing Pennsylvanians as to who would be litigating on their behalf. He received national press complimenting his \\"model\\" handling of the antitrust case brought by Rockfon against Armstrong World Industries in the District of Delaware. He held the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's Gallagher v. Geico decision is retroactive, allowing relief to insureds denied stacking benefits in their insurance policy. He also found a Fifth Amendment right not to be forced to reveal confidential telephone passcodes for investigatory purposes. In the wake of the #MeToo era, Kearney denied a University's motion to dismiss a male professor's erroneous outcome claims based on anti-male bias. In a physical and emotional assault lawsuit brought by a porn star, Kearney denied reality star Josh Duggar's motion to compel Danica Dillion's disclosures. In criminal cases, Judge Kearney dismissed an indictment against two men because the prosecutors and agents waited too long to bring them to trial even though they knew where to find them for years before unsealing the indictment. In April and July 2020, Kearney found a hotel franchisor could be liable for sex trafficking in its hotels and could turn and sue downstream franchisees and abusers accused of sex trafficking in company hotels in the same case. In one of the first cases in the country, his ruling addressed respective potential liabilities of hotels, local hotel franchise owners, and traffickers under the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008. Under the False Claims Act, Kearney held an electricians union could recover over $1,000,000 for a contractor‚Äôs false billing of electricians‚Äô work efforts on a rail project funded by the United States and later awarded approximately $1.4 million in attorney fees to the union (reducing the request) after success for over a decade of litigation. Kearney granted an employer‚Äôs motion to dismiss a claim by a former employee who also served as a U.S. Naval reservist seeking paid leave for when he left work for short voluntary military service after exploring Congress‚Äôs use of ‚Äúdefined benefits and seniority‚Äù guaranteed under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act.

Distribution Currently, the oldest known gracilisuchid is Turfanosuchus dabanensis from the Anisian stage of Xinjiang, China. Two gracilisuchids are known from the Ladinian or early Carnian stage, Gracilisuchus stipanicicorum and Yonghesuchus sangbiensis, from La Rioja Province of Argentina, and Shanxi, respectively. These species were considered enigmatic prior to the recognition of the family in 2014, suggesting a rapid phylogenetic diversification of archosaurs by the Middle Triassic. This radiation is a part of the broader recovery of terrestrial ecosystems after the Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event. Gracilisuchids are known from approximately similar northern and southern mid-palaeolatitudes, demonstrating a wide distribution of early archosaurs over much or all of Pangaea by the early Middle Triassic. History The family Gracilisuchidae first appeared in a classification scheme for all fossil vertebrates, published by Robert L. Carroll in 1988. As no description or definition were provided by Carroll for the erection of the name, it is unavailable under Article 13.1.1 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Richard J. Butler, Corwin Sullivan, Mart√≠n D. Ezcurra, Jun Liu, Agustina Lecuona and Roland B. Sookias described and officially named the family in 2014, to include several early archosaurs, previously considered enigmatic. Apart from Gracilisuchus stipanicicorum, Carroll assigned to Gracilisuchidae the Middle Triassic Lewisuchus admixtus, which is now considered a probable silesaurid dinosauriform. Turfanosuchus dabanensis and Yonghesuchus sangbiensis were considered basal or stem archosaurs prior to their inclusion in the family in 2014, depending on phylogenetic hypothesis.

He dedicated the shrine to thousands of gods at Mount H≈çman, which faces an unlucky direction. It has two sanctuaries, one at the foot of the mountain and one at its peak. There used to be a third sanctuary midway up the hillside, but only its ruins remains today.

Biography Cushing was born in New Haven, Connecticut, the son of William Lee Cushing, founder and headmaster of the Westminster School in Simsbury, Connecticut, and Mary Lewis Strong Cushing. He attended Westminster and later Yale University, where he was a member of Skull and Bones. He graduated in 1902. He was a tutor in the English Sudan in 1903 and a teacher of English and Greek at Westminster from 1909 to 1917. During World War II, he served in France in the entertainment division of the YMCA. Cushing died at Baker Memorial Hospital in Boston following an operation for a brain tumor. Professional career He made his Broadway in 1912 debut authoring the musical comedy Sari, an English language adaptation of the operetta Der Zigeunerprimas. Cushing complained to P. G. Wodehouse that he was only paid $500 for the play. In 1921, his play Thank You, co-written with Winchell Smith, debuted at the Longacre Theatre. Dorothy Parker wrote that it was \\"deftly done..and gently amusing. The small- town characters are not so obtrusively comic as they might be, and you can guess what a relief that is. If ever a play ended at the second act, Thank You is that very play, but there is, of course, a third act, so that the dress suits can be brought in, and the audience can feel that it has had its money's worth.\\" 1925 John Ford directed a film version Thank You. Another 1921 premiere, at the Empire Theatre, was Blood and Sand, his adaptation of the Vicente Blasco Ib√°√±ez novel Sangre y arena (1908). Otis Skinner starred as the toreador Juan Gallardo, and while his performance was acclaimed, critics thought he was too old for the part. Cushing's play was its adapted into a 1922 silent film version starring Rudolph Valentino. In 1923, his play Laugh, Clown, Laugh, co-written with David Belasco, debuted at the Belasco Theatre. It was adapted from the Italian play Ridi, Pagliaccio by . Lionel Barrymore starred as the depressed clown Tito Beppi. Lon Chaney played the role in a 1928 silent film adaptation. Out O'Luck, a comedy about doughboys in France, was performed by the Yale Dramatic Association in 1925 and later went on tour. Yale alumni Cole Porter contributed three songs to the play and its success provided him with badly needed confidence at a time when he considered abandoning songwriting. Cushing's 1926 play The Devil in the Cheese premiered at the Charles Hopkins Theatre. In it, an American couple, played by (Robert McWade and Catherine Calhoun Doucet) and their daughter (Linda Watkins) visit Meteora, where they are held for ransom by a Greek bandit posing as a priest and archaeologist (Bela Lugosi) and later rescued by the daughter's boyfriend (Fredric March). The second act takes place within the daughter's imagination, and includes adventurous travels in the South Seas and on a desert island, domestic life, and her becoming First Lady. After her father eats a piece of mummified cheese he is made privy to his daughter's daydreams thanks to the Egyptian god Min. The New York Times wrote of Lugosi's performance that he \\"acts with an authority and cadence worthy of better things\\". La Gringa (1928) premiered at the Little Theatre, starring Claudette Colbert. It was adapted as the now lost film South Sea Rose (1929). Barely Proper was a 1929 play that went unperformed on Broadway during his lifetime ‚Äì Cushing subtitled it An Unplayable Play ‚Äì but it was published. The play about a family of nudists was finally performed in 1970 at the Belasco by Ken McGuire to very poor reviews. Clive Barnes wrote in the New York Times that it was \\"making teensy-weensy headlines as being the first Broadway nudist play. It should probably be the last\\".

This \\"grinding\\" earns the player in-game currency which can be used to increase the rate of currency acquisition. In some games, even the clicking becomes unnecessary at some point, as the game plays itself, including in the player's absence, hence the moniker idle game. Gameplay In an incremental game, a player performs a simple action ‚Äì usually clicking a button ‚Äì which in turn rewards the player with currency. The player may spend currency to purchase items or abilities that allow the player to earn currency faster or automatically, without needing to perform the initial action. A common theme is offering the player sources of income displayed as buildings such as factories or farms. These sources increase the currency production rate, but higher tier sources usually have an exponentially higher cost, so upgrading between tiers takes usually about the same time or even increasingly longer. Some games feature a reset-based system where the player resets the progress of their game and gains another form of currency. This new currency is normally used to gain global bonuses which do not disappear after a reset, allowing the player to go further than the previous reset. Incremental games vary as to whether they have a victory condition: games like Cookie Clicker allow the players to play indefinitely, while games like Candy Box! or Universal Paperclips feature endings that can be reached after a certain amount of progress is made within the games. History Incremental games gained popularity in 2013 after the success of Cookie Clicker, although earlier games such as Cow Clicker and Candy Box! were based on the same principles. In 2015, the gaming press observed such games proliferating on the Steam game distribution platform with titles such as Clicker Heroes. Reception Nathan Grayson of Kotaku attributed the popularity of idle games to their ability to provide unchallenging distractions that fit easily into a person's daily routine, while using themes and aesthetics of more sophisticated games so as to be appealing to a \\"core gamer\\" audience. Grayson also noted that the genre allowed for a wide variety of game mechanics and themes, such as fantasy, sci-fi and erotica, to provide sufficient perceived depth to avoid boring players. IGN's Justin Davis describes the genre as being tuned for a never-ending sense of escalation, as expensive upgrades and items rapidly become available, only to become trivial and replaced by more. This leads to the player feeling powerful and weak at the same time in pursuit of exponential progress. Julien \\"Orteil\\" Thiennot (creator of games such as Cookie Clicker) described his own works as \\"non- games\\". In early 2014, Orteil released an early version of Idle Game Maker, a tool allowing customized idle games to be made without coding knowledge.

Through its multiple divisions: IMPACT Repertory Theatre, The Roger Furman Reading Series and New Heritage Films, New Heritage gives training, exposure and experience to new and emerging artists, playwrights, directors and technicians of color. New Heritage was founded by the late Roger Furman and is currently headed by Executive Producer Voza Rivers and Executive Artistic Director Jamal Joseph. NHTG presentations capture the historical, social and political experiences of Black and Latino descendants in America and abroad. Early history NHTG was established in 1964 as the New Heritage Repertory Theatre (NHRT) by the late Roger Furman, a playwright, director, actor, and lecturer. Furman's career in Harlem began at the American Negro Theater in the 1940s. He began New Heritage Repertory Theater (NHRT) in 1964 as a street theater while employed with HARYOU-ACT, a federally-financed anti-poverty program in Harlem. New Heritage Repertory Theatre, under Furman's leadership, produced over 35 plays including Strivers Row written by Abram Hill, co-founder of the American Negro Theatre. Furman also directed the Three Penny Opera featuring famed actress Geraldine Fitzgerald. Roger Furman was born on March 22, 1924 in New Jersey and studied theatre arts at the Dramatic Workshop of the New School for Social Research under Erwin Piscator. Furman worked as an apprentice under Rafael R√≠os Rey at the National Theatre of Puerto Rico and was a former student at the American Negro Theatre (ANT) with Sidney Potier, Clarice Taylor, Harry Belafonte, Ruby Dee and Gertrude Jeannette. Furman was the youngest person at the American Negro Theatre commissioned to design a set for Tin Top Valley, starring Fred O'Neil, produced by ANT. Furman's trademark was imaginative headgear and he believed in Harlem as a fertile theatrical seedbed. In addition to his acting and directing chores Furman taught courses on the History of Black Drama at New York University, Rutgers and Hartford University and was a co-founder of the Black Theater Alliance, an organization of performance groups. His directing chores include Bertolt Brecht's Three Penny Opera, Wine In the Wilderness(1969) and Mojo: A Black Love Story(1970) by Alice Childress. Furman Wrote and directed the critically acclaimed play The Long Black Block(1972) with music by Jackie McClean and co-authored and directed Fat Tuesday with Dee Robinson. Additional directing work by Furman includes: the award-winning Montezuma's Revenge, Harlem's classic On Strivers Row(1949), A Day of Absent, Hip, Black and Angry(1967), The Gimmick(1968), To Kill a Devil, Man In The Family, Harlem Heyday, Another Shade of Harlem, No Snakes In The Grass, Monseigneur Baptiste The Con Man and Fun in Games. New Heritage Repertory Theatre was awarded a training program grant from Columbia University School of Theatre to teach young Black and Puerto Ricans the technical aspects of theatre. In 1973, Roger Furman was a recipient of the AUDELCO Board of Directors Awards and was nominated for best director in 1975 for Fat Tuesday. His New Heritage Repertory Theatre was honored by Fibonacci Inc. for its contribution to the rich cultural life of the Harlem community. = New Leadership = In 1983 upon Furman's death, Voza Rivers, a co-founding member of NHTG (1964) and award-winning music and theatre producer, took over the company and reorganized under the name New Heritage Theatre Group (NHTG). Rivers is an accomplished theatre, music, film and events producer and is recognized as one of the country‚Äôs leading African American theatre producers. Since 1983, under the leadership of Voza Rivers, NHTG presents entertaining, informative theatrical productions, staged readings and documentary shorts and films, the mission was expanded to provide training, experience and international exposure to veteran and emerging artists.  Divisions  IMPACT Repertory Theatre, the youth division of NHTG, was established in 1997 by Jamal Joseph, a U.S. writer, director, producer, poet, activist, and educator to insure that the legacy of the company lives on. Since its founding IMPACT has featured hundreds of youth between the ages of 12 to 19 with original staged performances in front of live audience totalling over 100,000. New Heritage‚Äôs IMPACT Repertory Theatre is a group of youth activists who view the creative arts and leadership training as a way to develop themselves and change the world in a positive way. The mission of the group is to encourage hard work, focus, discipline, unity and the principles of S.O.S. safe space, outstanding effort and service to the community. Members participate in three programs which include Performance Arts, IMPACT Boot Camp where members learn the fundamentals of leadership, service and public speaking and lastly, Community Service Programs. IMPACT was OSCAR and GRAMMY nominated for their song Raise It Up from the movie August Rush starring Robin Williams. In December 2014, IMPACT performed a 20-minute piece in front of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge alongside youth performers from youth empowerment organizations The Door and City Kids. The Roger Furman Reading Series works with emerging and established playwrights on early drafts of their scripts with the goal of producing their work in front of a live audience. The series also provides a vehicle for celebrity artists associated with the company to return and perform in Harlem. Highlights of the Roger Furman Reading Series include producing plays for award-winning actors, playwright and author Daniel Beaty and playwright and radio host Esther Armah. In 2015 Voza Rivers and New Heritage Theatre Group partnered with MIST Harlem to present the staged reading series Bold New Voices, Past, Present and Future. The Bold New Voices series presents and creates stories about people of color. Programs will encompass African American, Asian, Hispanic and the African Diaspora cultural communities featuring music, film, drama, talk-backs, symposiums, play- writing, poetry, fiction workshops and more New Heritage Films & Harlemwood Film Festival explores issues of the African diaspora through film.

NHTG and Japan Connection  New Heritage Theatre Group has a long-standing historical relationship with Japan. Collaborations have resulted in then-Japanese Crown Prince Akihito's 1987 visit to Harlem and dozens of concerts in Japan and New York featuring Japanese and African American entertainers. New Heritage and its collaborating partners produce benefit concerts, theatrical productions and exhibitions in partnership with the Japan Chamber of Commerce, The Japan Society and The Consulate General of Japan in support of breaking down barriers of cultural misunderstanding. In 2012 New Heritage Theatre Group produced the 100th anniversary of the Sakura Cherry Blossom Festival in Harlem.  NHTG and South African Connection  New Heritage Theatre Groups connection to South African theatre began in 1984 when Rivers and his production team Andre Robinson, Phyllis Yvonne Stickney and his South African producing team Duma Ndlovu and Mbongeni Ngema transferred South African play Woza Albert!, a play that opened at Johannesburg's Market Theater and toured in Europe and America as was the most successful play to come out of South Africa to Harlem's New Heritage Theatre. The successful impact of Striver's Row inspired Rivers to look beyond the African American experience and reach across the world to introduce Harlem to the works of Black South African playwrights and actors which was an opportunity to bring lessons from the South African Apartheid to the Harlem community.

Under his leadership Elbit Systems multiplied its size many times and became a major player in the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle market globally as well as in other areas of military defence technology. Early life and education Federmann was born in Haifa to Bella and Yekutiel \\"Ksil\\" Federmann, brother of Irit Federmann-Landau. He received a bachelor's degree in economics and state studies and then a master's degree in business administration from the Hebrew University. He served in the Israel Defense Forces' elite unit Sayeret Matkal where he was a member of Ehud Barak's unit. Business Since 2002, Federmann has been the owner of Israeli conglomerate Federmann Enterprises Ltd which was started by his late father and uncle. His cousin Ami Federmann also holds a stake. Federmann chairs the boards of its two biggest publicly traded holdings: defense electronics maker Elbit Systems and luxury hotel operator Dan Hotels Corp. = Elbit = Federmann joined Elbit when his El-Op company merged with it in 1998. That doubled it in size. Elbit was naturally going to benefit from the global growth of the UAV market however, the 700% growth of Elbit over the following decade was also largely due to Federmann and CEO David Ackerman's leadership of Elbit Systems. They embarked on an ambitious global buyout strategy for the sake of growth. The strategy has made Elbit into a multibillion-dollar multinational. =Dan Hotels= Under the aegis of Federmann the hotel group has continued to grow, thanks to growing tourism and business in the country as well as ongoing expansion of the chain. Dan Hotels began as a boarding house on the Tel Aviv seafront that was purchased by his father and uncle in 1947. Over the following decades it grew to be a national chain. It is now expanding into India. Part of the chain is the iconic King David Hotel in Jerusalem, which since its founding in 1932 until this day hosts heads of state and diplomats on behalf of the Israeli government on their visits to Israel. Wealth He was ranked 7th wealthiest in the Maariv newspaper's top 100 in Israel in 2010 with an estimated wealth of 6.5 Billion Shekel (approximately $1.4 Billion). In that year he was ranked No. 721 in the Forbes list of billionaires. In 2011 he was ranked No. 879 and in 2012 he dropped off the ranking of the top 1000.

His illustrations appeared in many books and magazines. He was particularly known for his illustrations of contemporary Parisian fashions. Early years Execution of Jacques Molay from the 1839 Histoire de France The Hope of France - Napol√©on, Prince Imperial (1856‚Äì1879) accepting a petition from a Zouave Jean-Baptiste David was born in 1808. He was a pupil of Pierre Duval Le Camus, who painted moralistic subjects. Duval was in turn a pupil of the famous painter Jacques-Louis David. Jean-Baptiste David began work in 1824, using his power of observation and facility of drawing to produce a variety of landscapes and interiors in Gothic style for publishers. During the July Monarchy (1830‚Äì1848) David also published caricatures. He belonged to the mouvement party, and wanted to implement the ideals of liberty and the French republic. He derided the juste milieu of King Louis Philippe as a trick to prevent these ideals being achieved. A caricature by David appeared in La Caricature of 31 May 1831. The king is depicted as an illusionist who uses the juste milieu and some poudre de non-intervention to make liberty and revolution vanish. David's lithographs often attacked political tyranny, and religious hypocrisy. David exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1834. He was working for the editor Jeannin in 1836 when he won a 2,000 franc prize from Delessert, president of the Savings Bank of Paris, for a work about the triumph of Virtue. His album Vice and Virtue illustrated in twelve lithographs a good or bad action in each stage of life. Six plates were dedicated to vice and six to virtue. The one series showed the criminals arrested, taken to prison and on the scaffold. The other series showed scenes of work, study and so on. The work was praised for the quality of the drawings but criticized for its tendentious moralization. In 1839 the Histoire de France by Th√©odose Burette was published with 500 drawings by David, engraved by V. Chevin. L'Artiste announced the book, saying the illustrations would make the book \\"doubly popular\\". The next year L'Artiste gave a six-page review of the book, with reproductions of twelve of the illustrations, saying it was one of the most remarkable publications to have appeared for a long time. Six plates published by Jeannin in 1844 titled Le Moyen-Age. Moeurs et Coutumes (The Middle Ages, Customs and Costumes) depicted nobles absorbed in religion and beggars living on charity. David's compositions were lively and often humorous, in the style of Victor Adam and Fran√ßois Grenier. They were published until around 1855 in the Mus√©e de l'amateur, the Revue des peintres and L'Artiste. His best known works are the series of The Wandering Jew and The Mysteries of Paris, and the illustrations of Morality in Action and the History of Napoleon. He also made lithographs for many romance titles. Fashion illustrations Two Women in an Art Gallery (1868) Achille Dev√©ria introduced David to the Journal des demoiselles and the Journal des jeunes personnes, for which he produced lithographs from 1839 to 1842. David's albums were often published as a supplement to women's magazines. He drew all the plates for the Le Moniteur de la Mode for fifty years. About 2,600 of David's fashion plates were first published in the Moniteur de la Mode, and then republished in other magazines in France, Germany, Britain, Spain and America. He was a pioneer in introducing contemporary backgrounds in his plates. In 1860 Samuel Orchart Beeton, husband of Mrs Beeton and publisher of the Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine, began to include hand-colored fashion plates by David. These let his readers see the latest styles and colors from Paris, the world fashion center at the time. Beeton included paper patterns, which let owners of the newly introduced domestic sewing machines make their own dresses. Jean-Baptiste David died in 1892. In 1987 his sketchbooks were shown in an exhibition called Fashion drawings of Jules David (1808‚Äì1892) and his time at the Salon du Vieux-Colombier, town hall of the sixth arrondissement, Paris. During his long career, the fashionable figure was transformed. The delicate Dresden figurine of 1870, dressed in a modest, elaborate and very feminine style, was displaced by the \\"seven foot beauty with the ten inch waist\\" of 1893. The modern woman of 1893 was much more self-confident and her dress much more revealing and sophisticated than would have been suitable twenty years earlier.

The Illinois-based company developed and manufactured therapeutics and brought them to market. It employed 100 people in four global locations. In 2017, PTC Therapeutics acquired rights to Marathon Pharmaceuticals' drug Emflaza (deflazacort) for $140 million after criticism about their plan to sell the drug at a list price of $89,000 per year to sufferers despite the fact that the same drug was available in Canada and the UK for around $1,000 per year.  Business model  Marathon produced medicines for high-need, small patient populations, including patients with rare diseases as outlined by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs (FDA) Orphan Drug Act. The Act defines rare diseases as impacting fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S. Marathon developed late- stage drugs, earned regulatory approvals, and then manufactured and commercialized medicines with input from patient advocacy groups. Marathon‚Äôs regulatory efforts centered on gaining FDA approval of New Drug Applications (NDA) or Biologic License Applications (BLA). The company provided assistance for eligible patients with financial hardship and helped patients secure other assistance through the National Organization of Rare Disorders (NORD) and similar patient support groups. The company was criticized for their business model which uses regulatory loopholes and FDA incentives to cheaply acquire drugs to treat rare diseases and multiplying the list price to make a profit. Marathon distributed its products in North America.  Treatment pipeline  Marathon developed medications that targeted neurological, muscular, gastrointestinal and blood disorders, including deflazacort, a new medication to slow the progression of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in patients. In January 2015, Marathon was granted fast track status from FDA for deflazacort as a potential treatment for DMD. Exondys 51 and deflazacort are, as of 2/12/2017, the only FDA-approved drugs that treat DMD. Most patients usually die by age 25, although recently some people have lived into their 30s and 40s with assistive devices and support. Deflazacort On February 13, 2017, the CEO of Marathon, Jeff Aronin, announced that after four years of development and over 17 trials, the company was granted FDA approval for deflazacort (Emflaza) to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare disease that affects approximately 15,000 young boys in the U.S. Prior to the FDA approval, less than 10% of Duchenne patients in the U.S. had access to Emflaza. Post FDA approval, all Duchenne patients have access to an FDA approved and U.S. made drug that is being covered by over 170 payers and over 45 state Medicaid programs. Amid controversy over the proposed $89,000 wholesale price to payers, Marathon sold Emflaza and related assets to PTC Therapeutics, a firm with a 20-year history in Duchenne drug development. In Canada, the same drug, although never approved for treating Duchenne, could be purchased for around $1 per tablet and used off-label to treat the disease. According to The Wall Street Journal, the price Marathon was proposing was \\"roughly 70 times\\" more than deflazacort would cost overseas, such as in Europe where it was approved to treat 23 indications for a patient base of 83 million. In a 2015 Chicago Tribune article, parents had expressed concerns that if deflazacort were approved in the United States, FDA guidelines seemed to suggest that parents would not \\"be able to order it from another country.\\" They feared a \\"U.S. drug could be vastly more expensive than current international rates, leaving a question about insurance coverage.\\" Senator Bernie Sanders and Rep. Elijah Cummings are investigating the price of the drug as part of a larger investigation about the cost of pharmaceuticals.

From an immigrant family, he earned early recognition for his experimental work in anatomy, and helped reform Romanian medical science. He spent much of his youth training himself in anatomical pathology and the various areas of natural science, gaining direct experience as a microbiologist, surgeon, and military physician. With teaching positions at the University of Ia»ôi and the University of Bucharest, where he established specialized sections, Rainer became a noted promoter of science and an innovator in his field. He notably favored and introduced the anatomical study of \\"functional structures\\", and was in particular preoccupied with issues pertaining to ontogenesis and kinesiology. An intellectual influence on several generations of doctors, his wife was Marta Trancu-Rainer, Romania's first female surgeon. In addition to his experimental approach, Rainer is remembered as a talented pedagogue and public speaker, who took public stances in defense of his social and cultural ideals. Vilified by the far-right for his left-wing stances, he blended progressivism with genetic determinism, and, although an adept of eugenics, condemned scientific racism. He was notably involved with Dimitrie Gusti's project of rural sociology, contributing an anthropological record of several isolated villages on the Carpathian slopes. During his lifetime, Rainer also set up a large collection of craniums and skeletons, which became the centerpiece of his Bucharest anthropology department. Biography =Early life= Francisc Rainer was a native of Rohozna town, near Czernowitz, in Austrian-ruled Bukovina. His parents were Lutheran, but baptized their son Roman Catholic.Zamfirescu, p.155 His father, Gustav Adolf Ignatz Rainer, emigrated to the Romanian Old Kingdom as an employee of the Strousberg Company that built the Bucharest-Giurgiu railway, the country's first. Remaining there, he obtained a post in the administration of the national railroad company.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.21‚Äì22; Zamfirescu, p.155 His mother Maria (or Ana) came from a clerical family, and was a housewife.Riga & CƒÉlin, p.22 The boy received his primary education at home from his parents, later attending Saint Sava National College in Bucharest. Among the teachers who were particularly helpful was Sabba »òtefƒÉnescu in natural sciences.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.23‚Äì24; Zamfirescu, p.155 Rainer read extensively, teaching himself Latin and Ancient Greek, and becoming passionate about the literary works of Goethe and the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. He slowly discarded the latter's influence when he discovered Heraclitus, Ernst Haeckel, and classical materialistic thought.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.16‚Äì18, 22‚Äì26, 40, 121 Such works diverted him from his original goal of becoming a Catholic missionary. In 1892, he enrolled in the medical faculty of the University of Bucharest. While still a student, Rainer was given important tasks by a professor in his histological laboratory. In 1896, he was named a junior teaching assistant in the medical clinic at Col»õea Hospital; he remained there for nearly two decades.Majuru, pp.281‚Äì282; Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.24, 28‚Äì32, 177; Zamfirescu, p.155 During this time, troubled by \\"the great issues of the Cosmos\\", he imposed on himself a rigorous program of study and exercise (including cycling, mountaineering and fencing).Majuru, p.282 Although struggling to make ends meet, Rainer deepened his anatomical research, closely studying human morphology, and experimented with examination techniques during autopsies, founding a Romanian Anatomical Society for the purpose of sharing results.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.29‚Äì32, 38‚Äì39, 137 He also attended Anghel Saligny's lectures in chemistry at the School of Bridges, worked as a chemist in Constantin Istrati's lab, then as a pathologist at the Veterinary School.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.33, 35 He moved between Col»õea, Filaret and the school of assistant surgeons, taking part in the campaign against tuberculosis.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.36, 177 In the summers of 1900 and 1901, he took part in an anti-cholera campaign in the Danube Delta, which also allowed him to study the native flora and fauna.H√Ænganu, p.158; Riga & CƒÉlin, p.35 He completed his doctorate in 1903, the topic being a particular form of cirrhosis. Having performed numerous autopsies at the hospital, he made an original discovery himself; at the end of the thesis committee's debate, two of its members, Dr. Stoicescu from Col»õea and Victor Babe»ô, extended their collegial greetings to Rainer. Aside from this pair, his professors included Alexandru Obregia, Nicolae Kalinderu, Thoma Ionescu, Gheorghe Marinescu, Ioan Cantacuzino and Mina Minovici.H√Ænganu, p.157; Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.24, 26‚Äì28, 35, 38‚Äì39 Also in 1903, Rainer, recently naturalized Romanian, married Marta Trancu, an Armenian Romanian doctor who had worked with him at Col»õea.

The first, in 1906, involved work at Berlin's Frederick William University in the laboratories of Fedor Krause and Oscar Hertwig, as well as a study of embryology and comparative anatomy. His animal experiments there were primarily focused on the ossification process. At the anatomical institute led by Heinrich Wilhelm Waldeyer, he analyzed the brains of individuals belonging to different races.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.37‚Äì38, 107, 109; H√Ænganu, p.158 The second visit, in 1911, involved a stop at the German Hygiene Museum in Dresden, at the anatomy institute of the University of Jena and at Leipzig. Near the trip's conclusion, while in Weimar, he visited Goethe's House.H√Ænganu, p.158; Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.39‚Äì40 =Ia»ôi career and World War I= Upon his return in 1912, Rainer became assistant professor at Bucharest. The following year, with referrals from Constantin Ion Parhon,Riga & CƒÉlin, p.46 he became chairman of the anatomy department at the University of Ia»ôi medical faculty. Soon after his appointment, with the outbreak of the Second Balkan War, he was mobilized in the Romanian Land Forces medical service. He barely escaped with his life when his automobile fell off the pontoon bridge at Nikopol.Riga & CƒÉlin, p.47 Upon his return, he busied himself with organizing his Ia»ôi department, supplying the microscopes, microtomes, thermostats, magazine collections and a projector for the faculty.H√Ænganu, p.158; Riga & CƒÉlin, p.47 Meanwhile, during this period, he was involved in scientific publication, sitting on the editorial board of Spitalul, writing for Romania MedicalƒÉ and, in 1911, helping found the Paris-based Annales de Biologie.H√Ænganu, p.158; Riga & CƒÉlin, p.39 According to Marta Rainer's own account, her husband's move to Ia»ôi at age forty marked the end of a \\"prolonged adolescence\\", settling Rainer on the path to professional success.Majuru, p.281 As Rainer himself noted, teaching was a major responsibility: \\"I have always held the belief that there is no feeling so great, no thought so vast and deep, that they may not reach out to young minds and hearts.\\"Majuru, p.281; Riga & CƒÉlin, p.93 He set for himself the goal of answering to some of \\"the great issues of mankind\\", with \\"a prolonged action to strengthen my spirit.\\"Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.47‚Äì48 In his university lectures, Rainer taught that the purpose of medical science was human progress, \\"that we may always reach for something that is set higher\\".Vitner, p.104 He also held that \\"each of us owes more to society than society owes us.\\"Majuru, p.288; Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.90‚Äì91 While in Ia»ôi, Rainer joined the left-wing literary circle formed around Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ magazine, for which he contributed notes on medical science.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.62‚Äì63 He befriended the group's doyen, Garabet IbrƒÉileanu, whom he treated for his lung problems. Rainer persuaded IbrƒÉileanu, who was Marta's cousin,Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.60‚Äì61 to hold courses in Romanian language and literature two evenings a week for medical students. His intention was to develop cultured doctors, and the students heard lectures by Mihail Sadoveanu, George Top√Ærceanu and Titu Maiorescu.H√Ænganu, p.158; Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.61‚Äì62 He also took them for nature excursions so they could observe biological phenomena outside the laboratory.H√Ænganu, p.158 Rainer himself traveled extensively after 1914: among his earliest trips was a working visit to Od√≥n de Buen's oceanographic institute in Palma de Mallorca.H√Ænganu, p.158; Riga & CƒÉlin, p.64 In 1916, following Romania's entry into World War I, Rainer returned to Bucharest and rejoined Marta, being called up for medical service as a Colonel.Riga & CƒÉlin, p.67 During the 1916 counteroffensive, the Rainers set up surgery wards in the hospitals that had become full to overflowing with wounded from the Battle of Turtucaia and the zeppelin attack on Bucharest.H√Ænganu, pp.158‚Äì159; Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.65‚Äì67 Later, during Bucharest's occupation by the Central Powers, Francisc Rainer established temporary hospitals in schools. He continued teaching under the German administration, so that his students would not miss a year, but was also obliged to teach separate courses for German students. He managed to prevent the occupying authorities from requisitioning the faculty's possessions.H√Ænganu, pp.158‚Äì159; Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.68‚Äì70 Viewed as political suspects, the Rainers were singled out for internment in Bulgaria, but spared by Minovici's intervention on his behalf.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.69, 72 Marta Rainer, who managed war hospitals, organized teams of surgeons to help deal with the humanitarian crisis, and operated non-stop during the extremely cold winter of 1917‚Äì1918. Ana√Øs Nersesian, \\"O personalitate a medicinei rom√¢ne»ôti. Doctor Marta Trancu Rainer (3)\\", in Ararat, n.4/2006, p.6 Following Romania's withdrawal from the war, Rainer resumed his contacts with Romanian physicians stranded on unoccupied territory. His wartime work in experimental surgery attracted young men and women, including some of his former students at Ia»ôi. They included Grigore T. Popa, who was selected for Rainer's permanent team during 1918.H√Ænganu, p.159; Popa, p.230; Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.69‚Äì70 Other early members were Florica CernƒÉtescu (Popa's fianc√©e) and Ilie Th. Riga.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.69‚Äì70, 180 By late 1918, Rainer was conceiving of an education reform, aiming to compress theoretical aspects and \\"routine\\" work while providing students with as much laboratory experience as possible. His ideas were received with skepticism by the physiologist Ioan Athanasiu, who stood for the classical approach.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.111‚Äì113 For a while in 1919, Rainer made a return to teaching in Ia»ôi, where he also resumed his activity in the fight against tuberculosis.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.72‚Äì75 After the Armistice of November signaled a worldwide return to peace, Rainer had to fend off allegations and angry students demonstrations, with allegations that he had been a turncoat and a collaborator of the Germans. During 1919, a commission of inquiry cleared his name, noting that he had displayed \\"absolute loyalty\\" to the legitimate Romanian government.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.70‚Äì71 He himself vouched for his colleague Ecaterina Arbore, arrested for her revolutionary socialist militancy.Riga & CƒÉlin, p.73 After the general strike of 1920 was broken up by the authorities, Rainer was part of the investigative commission which determined that the labor organizer Her»ôcu Aroneanu had been beaten to death.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.74‚Äì75 =Bucharest school of anatomy creation= Rainer in his lab, with a specimen of cervical vertebrae (1926) In 1920, Rainer was employed by the new anatomy and embryology department set up at Bucharest University. Afflicted by deafness, attributed to his long-term exposure to formaldehyde, he continued to work at the same pace, but was noticeably withdrawn from public life.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.19‚Äì20 The anatomy section existed only in name when Rainer took over. Rainer took personal charge of furnishing it, in the end setting up a large collection of craniums and full skeletons that earned the respect of Western colleagues such as Eug√®ne Pittard,Bucur, p.78 Carleton S. Coon, Henri Victor Vallois, and Kurt Warnekros.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.85‚Äì86, 150‚Äì151 He was seconded by his devoted disciple and godson, the endocrinologist »òtefan Milcu (he eventually left Rainer's team in 1932, after developing an allergy to formaldehyde).BƒÉlƒÉceanu-Stolnici, pp.11‚Äì12, 13 Other important presences among Rainer's students and collaborators were George Emil PaladeRiga & CƒÉlin, p.19, 186 Mihai Neagu Basarab, \\"Dr. Natalia Neagu\\", in Via»õa MedicalƒÉ, n.3/2013 and VintilƒÉ Cioc√¢lteu, C.

At various intervals, the team also included surgeon Ion »öurai, pharmacologist Alfred Teitel, embryologist Benedict M. Menke»ô, and anatomist Zalman Iagnov.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.19, 129‚Äì130, 185‚Äì186; Francisc Schneider, \\"EvocƒÉri timi»ôorene\\", in Realitatea EvreiascƒÉ, n.360‚Äì361/2011, p.4 After his move, Rainer began expanding the scope of his contribution, and passed on to his students a particular view of science, decisively materialistic, rationalist, and anti-metaphysical.BrƒÉtescu, p.102, 154; Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.16‚Äì18, 43‚Äì46, 81‚Äì82, 90‚Äì93, 96‚Äì97, 110, 156‚Äì192; Vitner, pp.101‚Äì102, 105‚Äì106 In particular, Rainer rejected the intuitionism of Henri Bergson, which had enjoyed a surge in popularity.Vitner, p.107 His intellectual heroes and models of researchers included Claude Bernard, Rudolf Virchow, and especially Goethe.Majuru, p.287, 289; Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.16, 18, 64, 110, 113, 122‚Äì123, 125‚Äì128, 131‚Äì132, 178 The physician and left-wing political figure Ion Vitner writes that Rainer's understanding of the human body, heavily influenced by the work of Wilhelm Roux, centered on \\"life\\", \\"movement\\", \\"function\\", and ultimately \\"ontogenesis\\", rather than on the \\"static catalog\\" of 19th-century anatomy.Vitner, pp.102‚Äì104. See also BƒÉlƒÉceanu-Stolnici, p.13; Majuru, p.285; Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.83‚Äì84, 103, 106‚Äì139 This worldview seeped into Rainer's research, which assumed the existence of a \\"precise genetic program\\" in man's somatic development.BƒÉlƒÉceanu-Stolnici, p.13 He centered his attention on correlating the activities of various organs and their understanding as \\"functional structures\\".Majuru, p.285; Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.129‚Äì139; Vitner, pp.104‚Äì106 This helped him and his students make groundbreaking discoveries in area such as the dura mater, cranial nerves, the lateral aortic lymph nodes, and the hypophyseal portal system.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.137‚Äì139; Vitner, pp.104‚Äì106 In his study of spondylopathy, Rainer personally documented the existence of arthritis in the atlas.Riga & CƒÉlin, p.138 Physician I. Spielmann describes Rainer admiringly as a \\"polyhistor\\" with \\"a passionate image of what truth is\\".Majuru, p.287 According to a student, the historian of medicine G. BrƒÉtescu, Rainer was an outstanding pedagogue and public speaker, whose anatomy lessons were highly inspirational, but whose neglect for his public appearance could alienate young people.BrƒÉtescu, pp.74, 95, 97, 98, 101, 154, 285 As he writes: \\"After showing us that medical science is one of observation, but that in practice it involves continuous experimentation, and why it is more of a craft that demands medical instinct, Rainer provided us with the one effective measure to sustain it: uninterrupted self-examination\\".BrƒÉtescu, p.95 Vitner also noted Rainer's preference for orality, attributing it to an \\"extraordinary fear of the written word\\".Vitner, pp.100‚Äì101 Meanwhile, other specialists rejected Rainer's ideas and approach. According to anatomist Victor Papilian (whom Rainer had denounced as a plagiarist), Rainer's was \\"a sterile and envious school\\" of self-proclaimed \\"geniuses\\". According to Papilian, Rainer moved freely between subjects outside of his competence, including the paleontology of Leonardo da Vinci and the latest discoveries in astronomy. Richard Constantinescu, \\"Grigore T. Popa »ôi Victor Papilian √Æntre 'juriu de onoare' »ôi polemicƒÉ\\", in Revista MedicalƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, n.1/2011, p.39 Despite his progressive withdrawal from public life, Rainer was slowly being discovered as a public intellectual. In addition to his work at the university, he was again involved with Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, and, from 1920, was one of the magazine's trustees.Riga & CƒÉlin, p.63 He taught kinesiology at the Physical Education Institute, and artistic anatomy at the School of Fine Arts.Majuru, pp.282‚Äì283, 284‚Äì285; Riga & CƒÉlin, p.75, 186‚Äì191 His lectures in anthropology, hosted by the Physical Education Institute from 1923, are believed to be the oldest form of anthropological education in Romania.Majuru, pp.282‚Äì283, 286 Also that year, Rainer made a noted contribution to biological anthropology, publishing his finds on the medieval princely remains dug up in Curtea de Arge»ô.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.84, 150 He pursued other such investigations into the Romanian past, including the craniometry of Michael the Brave and the description of ancient tombs dug up at Turnu Severin.Riga & CƒÉlin, p.94, 150‚Äì151 Pursuing her own career in Bucharest hospitals, Marta was later a personal physician of Helen of Greece, wife of King Carol II of Romania.BrƒÉtescu, p.125 In their personal life, the Rainers experienced disappointment: having received her education in Romania, Sofia Rainer left for England, to attend the University of Bristol; she grew estranged from the family after her marriage to an Englishman, Archibald Philip Laing Gordon. =Biological anthropology= Rainer performing anthropometry at Fundu Moldovei (1928) Rainer's views eventually placed him at odds with the emerging far-right and antisemitic movement of the 1920s. At a time when the Ia»ôi-based National-Christian Defense League (LANC), seeking to purge Jews from Romanian universities, was gaining momentum in Bucharest, a student identified Rainer as a Jew, and issued claims denying merit to his scholarship. According to Vitner, Rainer was the diametrical opposite of a Ia»ôi rival, the racist and LANC affiliate Nicolae Paulescu, who stood for \\"dark and backward scientism\\".Vitner, p.101 Vitner also recalls that Rainer was even shot at by far-right affiliates, so that he would no longer popularize his \\"democratic convictions\\".Vitner, pp.107‚Äì108 For a while, Rainer was under the permanent protection of a Gendarme guard. Nevertheless, Rainer was himself an active proponent of \\"hereditary determinism\\" and eugenics, which he understood as the cornerstone of social welfare policy.Bucur, pp.78‚Äì79, 110, 293‚Äì294. See also Majuru, p.285 As he put it: \\"In the colorful mass of genes that carry those characteristics we inherit from our forerunners, one may find embedded [...] even our very destinies as men.\\" A committed physiognomist,BrƒÉtescu, pp.102‚Äì103 he believed that \\"only the phenotype may be influenced, to a certain extent, by our environment and our education.\\" In June 1929, the newspaper AdevƒÉrul published one of Rainer's critical essays on the 1923 land reform. In it, Rainer claimed that the system of land reallocation had proved ignorant of eugenic and biopolitical principles.Bucur, pp.78‚Äì79, 143, 327, 356 Nevertheless, as readers of his work suggests, Rainer helped preserve a balance in anthropology by also looking into environmental factors, thus questioning the ideological supremacy of scientific racism.Vitner, p.105; Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.147‚Äì149 During the 1920s and early '30s, Rainer was often depressed, believing that his contribution to medical science was largely insignificant.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.76, 77, 79‚Äì80 He was also upset that various of his disciples, including Daniel Danielopolu, no longer acknowledged him in their own tracts about the \\"science of life\\", which seemed to him a case of plagiarism.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.113‚Äì117 He was dividing his time between Bucharest and the resort of Cheia, where he owned a small piece of property.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.190‚Äì191 Subsequently, Rainer mainly focused on anthropological work and the popularization of anthropological science. Alongside sociologists such as Dimitrie Gusti, Henri H. Stahl, Sabin ManuilƒÉ, Mircea VulcƒÉnescu and Xenia Costa-Foru, he was present on the teaching staff of Veturia ManuilƒÉ's private school, where he gave lectures in anatomy to all- female classes preparing for a career in social services.Bucur, pp.15, 238‚Äì240; Stahl, p.190 Between 1928 and 1932, Rainer was also involved in Gusti's rural sociology project in the Carpathians. Joining the Gusti team as an anthropometrist, he earned kudos from the scientific community of his day with Enqu√™tes anthropologiques dans trois villages roumains des Carpathes (\\"Anthropological Queries in Three Romanian Villages of the Carpathians\\").Bucur, p.78; Majuru, p.287; Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.87‚Äì89, 152 Published in 1937, it remains one of just four testimonials written by members of Gusti's team.»öone, pp.64, 65 While on location in Nereju, DrƒÉgu»ô and Fundu Moldovei, he expanded the canon of anthropometry, and began recording blood type, investigated the presence and spread of syphilis, and provided free medical consultations to the peasants.Majuru, pp.286‚Äì287; Stahl, pp.48, 68‚Äì69, 88‚Äì90, 106, 148, 175; »öone, passim Rainer and his specialist unit, including social hygienists, documented the squalid conditions of rural life. At Fundu Moldovei, where some of the villages were entirely cut off from the outside world, Rainer found that up to 50% of his samples showed contamination with syphilis, forcing him to distribute reserves of neosalvarsan.»öone, pp.66, 71‚Äì72 Stahl, who befriended Rainer in Fundu Moldovei, recalls that the stated purpose of Rainer's visit was an attempt to bridge physiology and sociology: \\"he did not yet see what that connection might be, but any research should be carried out rigorously, so that, who knows, another generation, more skilled than we are, might come along and use it.\\"Stahl, p.89 Rainer's anthropometric work, which used for a permanent record peasant photographs, in large part taken by Milcu,BƒÉlƒÉceanu-Stolnici, pp.18, 19 remains a problematic aspect of Gustian sociology. As noted by cultural historian Z. Ornea (based on Stahl's recollections), Rainer \\"carried out unperturbed his anthropometric research, although he was not an adept of racial science and had no idea of what this anthropometry and blood chemistry [...] were going to be used for. And yet, the great professor of histology would return annually to the villages that were studied by the monographic teams and to carry out this research with no purpose and no finality.\\" Z. Ornea, \\"Un interviu incitant cu H.H. Stahl\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, n.23/2001 Anthropologist VintilƒÉ MihƒÉilescu also notes that the combination of Gusti's sociology and Rainer's physical anthropology was a \\"domestic ethnology\\", \\"self-referential\\" and \\"biased\\", but nevertheless an \\"important tool\\" for later cultural anthropology.MihƒÉilescu, pp.210‚Äì211 Rainer also made frequent trips to Western Europe and the Balkans. He was in Sweden during 1930, attending the Physiological Congress as a Physical Education Institute delegate, and paying a visit to the Racial Biology Institute.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.75‚Äì76, 189‚Äì190 In 1931 and again in 1933, he was in Greece together with sculptor Mac Constantinescu, gathering material about artistic depictions of humans in the Mycenaean period.H√Ænganu, p.159; Riga & CƒÉlin, p.76 In 1935, he lectured at the Romanian Atheneum on the links between Platonism and modern science, being introduced there by zoologist Constantin Kiri»õescu (one of several popularization conferences Rainer held at the Atheneum, Dalles Hall, and in various provincial cities).Riga & CƒÉlin, p.15, 16, 90‚Äì94 He kept his depression under control by taking trips to Turkey, and again to Greece, where he dedicated himself to the study of customs and classical art.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.76‚Äì78 Upon his return, Rainer opened his bone collection for the public, as a permanent museum, during the Bucharest International Congress of Anthropology and Prehistorical Archeology, 1937. It comprised some 6,000 bone relics and casts.Majuru, p.287. See also Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.84‚Äì86 =Final years= Rainer at his anthropological research center, alongside King Michael I and Queen Helen (autumn 1940) With his activity in academia, Rainer reacted against cronyism, taking a public stand against arbitrary appointments in teaching, and ruining his relationship with the establishment.Riga & CƒÉlin, p.79-80 At a time when the Romanian school of anthropology was being divided between centrists and supporters of the fascist Iron Guard,Stahl, pp.23, 143‚Äì144, 157, 185, 214‚Äì221, 299‚Äì300, 313‚Äì315, 332‚Äì333 he was again confronted by the far-right. Rainer was opposed to the fascist youth, whose members instigated in favor of academic censorship in his university curriculum. At one such incident in early 1938, Rainer stood unmoved at his desk as some of his fascist students, including the son of painter Nicolae Tonitza, lit firecrackers and threw eggs in his direction. However, he refused to ask for sanctions against them, and eventually received their letter of apology.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.80‚Äì81 After 1939, although Romania was formally aligned with Nazi Germany, Rainer spoke out against Nazi racial science. In his public lectures, he dismissed the Nazi claim that cephalic indexes were good predictors of intelligence.BƒÉlƒÉceanu-Stolnici, p.16 His publicized texts, deemed \\"courageous\\" by historian Adrian Majuru, accepted the idea of race, but denied the concept of a \\"pure race\\", rejected the scientific claims of Aryanism, and argued that European civilization owed its existence to Semitic peoples.Majuru, p.286. See also Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.89, 145‚Äì148 According to Rainer, races were rather phenotypical isolates of only one species, the homo sapiens recens, of the same genetic age; there existed no racial hierarchy.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.145‚Äì147 In 1940, at the height of World War II, Rainer helped establish an anthropological research center of which he was honorary director until his death.

Later that year, Rainer retired from teaching, having reached the age limit. The students demanded and obtained that he be allowed to hold additional lectures in general and human biology, despite Rainer's problematic deafness.BrƒÉtescu, pp.101‚Äì103, 106, 113‚Äì116; Riga & CƒÉlin, p.91 Meanwhile, G.

Maintaining a philosophical correspondence with the medievalist Alphonse Dupront, who was stranded in occupied France, he described the Nazi age as an \\"empire of suffering\\", reaffirming his conviction in \\"the future of mankind\\".Riga & CƒÉlin, p.96 He was among the signers of a letter of protest, addressed to dictator Ion Antonescu, which questioned Romania's participation in the anti-Soviet war.Riga & CƒÉlin, p.18 During the same months, Rainer diagnosed himself with lung cancer, which was another probable effect of his long exposure to formaldehyde fumes. He tried to hide this from his wife and his friends, claiming his problem was a mere case of paresis.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.99‚Äì100 His house was narrowly missed by the April 1944 bombardment, and he had to move into the house of a former assistant, Ion »öurai. He was later moved to Hospital No. 303, where he developed metastasis in the brain.Riga & CƒÉlin, p.100 Rainer asked to be relocated to his townhouse, where he died on the morning of August 4, 1944. He had predicted the exact time of his death, and written precise instructions for his body's embalming.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.100, 101 This occurred just nineteen days before the Palace Coup that ended Romania's alliance with the Axis Powers. With the onset of Soviet occupation, Rainer's left-wing stances were highlighted in his official commemoration. BrƒÉtescu, who was also a Communist Youth militant, published such homages in the newspaper Tribuna Poporului, and spoke about Rainer at the Students' Society.BrƒÉtescu, pp.122‚Äì124, 134 In the latter address, he emphasized that Rainer had been an antifascist and a reader of political works by Joseph Stalin.BrƒÉtescu, p.134 Legacy Rainer was generally well regarded by the communist regime, which existed in Romania until the 1989 Revolution. His texts on science and society were collected and preserved, against Rainer's final wish that they should all be burned. Some were carried in the first issues of Contemporanul review, from September 1946.Ioan LƒÉcustƒÉ, \\"√én Bucure»ôti, acum 50 de ani\\", in Magazin Istoric, September 1996, p.31 In 1948, the corpus was published by the Academy as four volumes, together with critical essays and memoirs edited by Marta Rainer and Mihail Sevastos.Vitner, p.100. See also Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.5‚Äì6, 14‚Äì15 However, his anthropological museum, assigned to Popa and later to Milcu, was poorly staffed by the communist supervisors and faced closure. Communist supervisors such as Mihail Roller suspected that Rainer had created the anthropology research center to promote racism, but Milcu was able to convince them otherwise, and even obtained funds for an anthropological study of Romanian ethnogenesis.BƒÉlƒÉceanu-Stolnici, pp.15‚Äì16 Despite other political obstacles and the communist rejection of anthropology as an \\"abstract intellectual game\\", cultural anthropologist Vasile Caramelea was able to obtain approval for further research, and expanded the institute's contribution to social science.MihƒÉilescu, p.212 A biography of Rainer was published by Ilie Th. Riga, in 1966, at Editura »òtiin»õificƒÉ. It revealed to the public glimpses of Rainer's diaries, which had been preserved by Marta Rainer.Riga & CƒÉlin, pp.5‚Äì6 Another encomium, signed by Th. EnƒÉchescu, saw print in the academic journal Studii »ôi CercetƒÉri Antopologice in 1970.BrƒÉtescu, p.318 In 1979, at Editura Eminescu, BrƒÉtescu and Mihai Neagu Basarab published Rainer's diaries and letters, which were received with great interest by the intellectual community, including Geo Bogza, Constantin Noica and Nicolae Steinhardt,BrƒÉtescu, pp.343, 365 but less enthusiastically by the general public. As later noted by BrƒÉtescu, regular readers found Rainer's thoughts on \\"the coherence of the Cosmos\\" to be \\"pretentious banalities\\".BrƒÉtescu, p.344 Rainer continued to be held in high regard after the Revolution, when light was shed on various other aspects of his work. A 2001 exhibit of his skulls collection at Galeria Catacomba made a point of reintroducing his work to the cultural circles of the day.

It was released in China on 13 June 2014. Plot A Mu moves with his wife, Le Xiaomei, who is two months pregnant, to a mountainside villa owned by his friend, A Ming. The villa is decorated with paintings of two boys playing string game and there is also a locked room A Mu claimed belonging to A Ming. Supernatural occurrences begin to haunt the couple, including a red doll that stalks Xiaomei, a music tape that plays a string game song, and most importantly, a ghostly woman with long hair and white dress. The doll is disposed of by A Mu at Xiaomei's request, while the paintings always resurface back whenever Xiaomei tries to remove it. A Mu also sees a woman in black robe who seems to watch him while going to work everyday. One day, the two visit the orphanage that A Mu grew up in to become fundraisers. Xiaomei learns about a loner orphan in A Mu's generation named Xiaoshan who died when he was 10 years old. After a series of boxes containing increasingly threatening messages are left at his doorstep, A Mu installs security cameras around the house. That night, Xiaomei watches the footage to find a cloaked figure leaving the house. She decides to break into A Ming's room, finding more paintings of the boys and the disposed red doll. Spooked by the woman, Xiaomei runs away, pulling some of the woman's hair in the process, and falls off the stairs, causing her baby's miscarriage. Arriving back at home from the hospital, Xiaomei forces A Mu to reveal the truth about Qingqing, his fellow orphan and childhood friend together with A Ming. A Mu and Qingqing maintain their relationship well to adulthood, but Qingqing apparently left him for a rich man when he struggled on money. She was subsequently killed by A Ming, who justified his actions due to her unfaithfulness. A Ming buried her body and showed it to A Mu the previous night, despite Xiaomei's claims about the hair. Another box is soon delivered to the couple, warning about not combing the hair during midnight, a trait of Qingqing. Xiaomei does just that and summons the woman in white, who tells her that A Ming does not exist. From A Mu's orphanage, Xiaomei learns that \\"A Ming\\" is a nickname given to Xiaoshan, the son of two imprisoned thieves whose only friend in the orphanage was A Mu. One day, the two escaped from a locked room they were imprisoned in for robbery but slipped through the roofs. The dean chose to save A Mu over A Ming, as A Mu is her grandson born out of wedlock. She promptly gave offerings for A Ming, but suffered a heart attack and died with her face burnt. Xiaomei is visited by the woman in white, revealed to be Qingqing's younger half- sister, Yu Xiaohan. Xiaohan apologizes for the miscarriage and states that she wants Mu Kainan, A Mu's real name, to confess in his murder of Qingqing, the latter having supported Xiaohan's leukemia treatment and being the only family who supported her. She does this by haunting him, as \\"people would tell the truth if they are scared\\". A Mu arrives, exhibiting his dissociative identity disorder by constantly switching between his A Mu and A Ming's persona. In his A Ming's persona, he knocks out Xiaomei and bounds her, confirming his deeds including the murder of his grandmother. However, he is unable to kill her due to A Mu's memories of their relationship resurfacing. A Mu decides to commit suicide to prevent himself from harming Xiaomei even further. Xiaomei visits Xiaohan at the hospital to inform her that A Mu left some money for her and Qingqing so she could pay her bills, wishing her recovery and saying that she is not alone anymore. Next she visits A Mu's orphanage and is horrified when she meets a new girl, Yangyang, carrying the red doll. Yangyang sings the string game song and a hand grabs the doll before the movie cuts off.

Although meteorological records are sparse and generally incomplete, they indicate that three significant tropical cyclones affected land, each causing some degree of damage. The first system struck North Carolina on July 18, causing significant damage before battering the Mid-Atlantic states with high tides, strong winds, and heavy rainfall. Torrential rainfall caused river flooding from Baltimore to Philadelphia, particularly along the Schuylkill River, which took the lives of 20 people in various incidents. Strong winds damaged property and public facilities in and around New York City, and damaging floods extended into central and northern New England. Crops and railroad infrastructure suffered throughout the entire region. On August 22, a strong hurricane impacted Havana, Cuba, destroying fruit trees and disrupting shipping, before making landfall on the Florida Panhandle with an enormous storm surge. Coastal flooding was severe around Apalachicola, and as the storm moved inland, it generated destructive winds across the southeastern United States. Abundant precipitation fell from Georgia through Virginia, causing extensive flooding; one river swelled over 20 feet (6 m) above its normal height. The storm blew down crops and trees along its course, and toppled a large railroad bridge near Halifax, North Carolina. Offshore, a pilot boat collided with a larger ship in the rough seas and sank. Considered the worst storm in nearly 30 years in the tidewater region of Virginia, the cyclone briefly reentered the Atlantic off New Jersey before making landfall over New England. Strong winds and moderate to heavy rains plagued much of New England on August 24 and 25. On September 7 and 8, a hurricane brushed the coastline from New York to Cape Cod with gusty winds and appreciable rainfall, and left many ships in distress. The system later struck Atlantic Canada, likely causing \\"great loss of property and lives\\", though damage reports were limited. Fragmented records exist of other hurricanes, including two which remained over open seas in early September and the middle of October. Background Attempts to catalog Atlantic hurricanes in the first half of the 19th century began as early as 1855, when Andr√©s Poey compiled information on just over 400 tropical cyclones from 1493 to 1855.Chenoweth, p. 3 However, Poey listed only three of the five or more hurricanes that developed in 1850. In his 1963 book, Early American Hurricanes, 1492‚Äì1870, weather researcher David M. Ludlum discusses, in greater detail, three significant tropical cyclones that impacted the United States in 1850. Unusually, all three heavily impacted the northeastern states; Ludlum compares the season to 1954, in which three major tropical systems impacted the Eastern Seaboard. More traditional hurricane targets, such as Florida, were spared the brunt of seasonal tropical cyclone activity in 1850, while the atmosphere farther north was abnormally tropical. Newark, New Jersey, had its warmest‚Äîand one of its rainiest‚Äîsummers on record at the time, owing to frequent nearby hurricanes and the influx of tropical air.Ludlum (1963), p. 96 Meteorological reports pertaining to the season were largely lost in a Smithsonian Institution fire in 1856, limiting what is known about hurricane activity in 1850.Ludlum (1963), pp. 96‚Äì97 As the season falls outside the scope of the Atlantic hurricane database (1851 onward) and its associated reanalysis project, records are regarded as incomplete. Extant accounts of the storms in 1850 are chiefly based on private weather records and press reports, and only approximate storm tracks are known. Storms =Mid-July= The first documented hurricane in 1850 originated in the Caribbean Sea, where it wrecked dozens of ships along the Windward Islands on July 11 and 12. On July 18, the storm struck North Carolina from the south as a hurricane of at least Category 1 intensity (on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale) and proceeded northward. Although the exact point of landfall is unknown, the system is believed to have moved ashore south of Cape Hatteras.Ludlum (1963), p. 97 Ships just off the state's coast battled three days of hurricane conditions from July 15 to July 18. Onshore, \\"great damage\\" occurred from Wilmington to Elizabeth City. Intense wave action churned the Chesapeake Bay, while storm-heightened tides up to above normal flooded wharves and coastal communities. The Baltimore area endured persistent gale- force winds accompanied by torrential rainfall. As streams and rivers swelled above their banks, cellars and streets became inundated by floodwaters. Many trees were blown down and numerous poorly built or unfinished buildings were destroyed. The storm cut telegraph communications between Baltimore and surrounding areas. In the countryside, low-lying hay fields were flooded and most of the corn crop was decimated. At Bladensburg, Maryland, a train station and locomotive were washed into an adjacent flooded waterway. Arrivals of ships into port were delayed by the storm, which one captain held to be the worst he had ever observed, and some vessels incurred extensive damage. The storm's effects quickly spread northward. Winds at Philadelphia began to increase in the morning on July 18, becoming severe by the evening hours. Air pressure fell to early on July 19 as the hurricane's center passed to the west, and the city received more than of rainfall. The storm wrought significant damage throughout the city, including to trees, signs, and structures. A number of houses were demolished, and many more‚Äîincluding a large brick building near Rittenhouse Square‚Äîsuffered damage. Major freshwater flooding was observed in the area, especially along the Schuylkill River, which rapidly rose to its highest level since 1838. A large quantity of lumber was swept away, and several docks were submerged. Their \\"worst apprehensions realized\\", hundreds of residents worked hurriedly to mitigate damage from the flooding. Bridges over the river at Phoenixville were washed away, resulting in the deaths of four individuals. A lock of a dam upstream of Phoenixville gave way, destroying a boat and killing its occupants. Four men and a child reportedly drowned on the river's banks near Conshohocken. Railways were covered with up to 3 feet of water in low-lying spots. Numerous small craft capsized on the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers. Overall, 20 people died in various storm-related tragedies along the Schuylkill. The hurricane took a heavy toll on agriculture in the Mid-Atlantic states. Rampant flooding outside Philadelphia destroyed fruit orchards, and in nearby Burlington, New Jersey, strong winds and heavy rainfall inflicted significant damage to crops on the night of July 18, leaving entire fields of corn blown down. The Delaware River burst its banks at Burlington, inundating nearby lowlands. Notable flooding also took place along the Lehigh River. Telegraph lines north of Philadelphia were crippled, limiting communications in the storm's aftermath. Throughout the region, downed trees blocked railways. Hurricane-force gusts buffeted Newark, New Jersey, and rainfall exceeded a weather observer's rain gauge capacity of . Strong winds imperiled New York City late on July 18 into the next morning; there was widespread tree damage, with branches and leaves littering the ground, and many specimens uprooted or snapped. The storm ruined awnings and tore metal roofs off several buildings. Some ships in New York Harbor were ripped from their anchors and blown aground; further east, multiple coaster vessels were wrecked along the coast of Long Island. The winds and storm tides destroyed bath houses and other facilities at Coney Island. As the storm tracked northward through central New York State, it produced high southeasterly winds and heavy rainfall across most of New England. At Fort Trumbull along the coast of Connecticut, heavy rainfall starting early on July 19 accumulated to . At Hartford, flooding caused about $100,000 (1850 USD) in losses. Southeasterly winds peaked at tropical storm- force. Damage to property and crops was confined to western New England, leaving areas such as eastern Massachusetts unscathed. Less substantial rain was reported at Providence, amounting to . The rain shield extended into far- northern New England, producing of precipitation at Montpelier, Vermont, and at Burlington. The resultant flooding was in some cases the greatest in recent memory.Ludlum (1963), p. 98 =Late August= A tropical system first observed near Barbados on August 16 proceeded to affect the Windward Islands before yielding hurricane conditions at Ponce, Puerto Rico, on August 20.Chenoweth, p. 67 Two days later, the hurricane tracked over western Cuba, causing severe weather conditions around Havana. The storm destroyed large swaths of banana and plantain trees, and all vessels in Havana Harbor dragged anchors at the height of the hurricane. The storm moved north over the eastern Gulf of Mexico, striking the Florida Panhandle between Pensacola and Panama City on August 23. Extremely high tides bombarded the Apalachicola area, resulting in extensive coastal flooding. The hurricane destroyed wharves and left many ships damaged or foundered. Sea water intrusion inundated warehouses and streets in Apalachicola, and one street was made impassable by strewn debris and fallen trees.Barnes, p. 63 Farther east, a bridge over the Wakulla River was washed away by raging floodwaters. A long period of high winds was reported at the state's capital city of Tallahassee. The storm produced some strong winds in interior Georgia on its way to the Carolinas. The destruction of homes, crops, and trees was reported from Griffin through Augusta. Adverse conditions extended westward to Montgomery, Alabama, where the night of August 23 was marked by high winds and heavy rainfall. Southeasterly gales had a large impact on shipping interests off North Carolina. Several vessels were imperiled; in one case a pilot boat capsized after colliding with another ship. In light of this incident, the hurricane is listed in the National Hurricane Center's contemporary compilation of tropical cyclones that \\"may have\\" caused at least 25 fatalities. The storm grounded the schooner H. Wescott near Cape Fear. Gales were reported from Savannah, Georgia, to Wilmington, North Carolina. Near Halifax, North Carolina, the winds toppled a railroad bridge about 450 ft (140 m) long and 60 ft (20 m) high. The storm also ravaged farmland in the area, destroying crops, fences, trees, and structures, and injuring several people. Much damage was reported in the Raleigh area, and many trees in New Bern suffered at least some limb breakage; several large trees were fully uprooted. The local corn crop‚Äîalready diminished from the July hurricane‚Äîwas judged completely lost, though property damage was negligible. Offshore winds from the storm created a negative storm surge on the Neuse River, leaving docks dry for a time. Torrential rains over a large area from Georgia to Virginia triggered severe river flooding. The Dan River, which flows through North Carolina and Virginia, swelled 20 ft (6 m), amplified to above normal in narrow channels. In the Carolinas, mills, dams, and roads were washed out, and losses in central North Carolina alone totaled an estimated $7 million. Gale-force winds lashed the tidewater region of Virginia in what was considered the worst storm on the lower Chesapeake Bay since the 1821 Norfolk and Long Island hurricane. A ship called the Osceola lost its wheelhouse to the winds, while onshore, the storm razed crops and a few small structures such as barns and outhouses. Affecting many of the same areas as the July hurricane, the cyclone downed trees in and around Baltimore and caused street flooding in Washington, D.C., where a railroad bridge was swept away. The storm began to influence the weather at Philadelphia on the night of August 24. Strong winds out of the north and northeast at Philadelphia and Newark, New Jersey, suggest the center moved off the New Jersey coast and reemerged into the Atlantic. In addition to the gales, more than 3 in (75 mm) of rain fell on Newark on August 25. 1849 railroad map of New England‚Äîclick to enlarge Winds at New London, Connecticut, and Providence, Rhode Island, veered from southeast to south, then west, so the storm center likely tracked somewhere over Connecticut. The storm adversely affected shipping on the Long Island Sound, and heavy rain fell across much of New England. Fort Trumbull recorded of rain, while fell at Providence; the deluge triggered flash flooding, though few details are known about the extent of the damage. =Early September= The third and final widely documented hurricane to affect the U.S. East Coast in 1850 remained predominately offshore, but still impacted ships and coastal cities on September 7 and 8. A vessel about east of Atlantic City, New Jersey, intercepted the hurricane's center and recorded a pressure of 988 mbar (29.18 inHg) on the night of September 7. Numerous ships near the Delaware coast were stricken. Gusty winds snapped tree branches in New York City, while Newark received of rain as the hurricane brushed the region. The system probably continued toward the northeast, passing south of Nantucket, Massachusetts. There, gale-force winds initially blew out of the southeast before shifting to north midday on September 8. Similarly, Cape Cod experienced blustery conditions accompanied by heavy rainfall, though damage in eastern New England was generally inconsequential. Providence, Rhode Island, received of rain. The storm later affected the Canadian Maritimes, causing heavy disruption in Nova Scotia. Downed telegraph wires in the region delayed damage reports until repairs were completed.Ludlum (1963), pp. 98‚Äì99 The cyclone \\"undoubtedly caused great loss of property and lives along the coast\\", according to a report from the telegraph office at Halifax. =Other storms= A strong squall swept across Matagorda Bay in southeastern Texas on June 27. High winds ripped a ship from its anchor and drove it aground, and at least one other vessel suffered structural damage. Although it is included in the Weather Prediction Center's publication, Texas Hurricane History, little is known about the nature of the storm. Shipping data indicates a hurricane formed near Cape Verde on September 2 and tracked northward into the northeastern Atlantic over the next week. Andr√©s Poey listed this system as two distinct cyclones, later confirmed by Chenoweth (2006) to be a single storm. A final hurricane is believed to have existed over the central Atlantic in mid-October, moving from near 24.5¬∞N, 47¬∞W to 25.5¬∞N, 41¬∞W over the course of four days.

Due to its high spatial and temporal variability, its behavior is more complex than over a flat terrain. The fast changing local wind system directly linked to topography and the variable land cover that goes from snow to vegetation have a significant effect on the growth of the PBL and make it much harder to predict. Understanding the processes inducing changes in the mountain PBL have critical applications for predicting air pollution transport, fire weather and local intense thunderstorm events. While some processes, such as mountain waves, have been well studied in the mountain PBL due to their importance for aviation, most of the behaviors of the alpine PBL are relatively unknown.Investigation of the Planetary Boundary Layer in the Swiss Alps Using Remote Sensing and In Situ Measurements Wind systems  The PBL in complex terrain is shaped by three local (non synoptic) wind systems occurring at different scales, which are closely related to the structure of the topography. The height of the PBL can be observed using radio soundings, which measure temperature and humidity gradients or LIDAR, which measures the backscatters of the aerosols. =Mountain-Plain winds= The Mountain-Plain winds system is the largest scale phenomenon going across the mountain range. Daytime mountain-plain wind system During daytime, incoming solar radiation heats up the mountain top faster than the plain, creating a mean low pressure zone at the top. Winds then blow towards the mountain on all sides, flow up the slope and converge at the top. A return flow occurs aloft and comes back down into the plains. The exact opposite happens during nighttime, when the top cools down faster than the plain, which creates a mean high pressure zone leading to winds coming from the mountain top down to the plain. This represents the idealized situation since many complications can arise from cross currents, forced or pressure driven channeling or even cold fronts approaching the mountain barrier. =Valley winds= Up-valley winds during the day and down-valley winds at night. Valley winds are best developed on clear summer days and are driven by horizontal pressure gradients. During the day, the valley is warmer than the flat terrain (because it contains a smaller volume of air receiving the same amount of radiation), which creates a lower pressure zone over the valley, entraining the air from the plains up to the valley. The opposite process occurs at nighttime, where the valley cools faster and the air flows back down to the plains . =Slope winds= Up-slope winds during the day and down-slope winds at night. Slope-winds are produced by the temperature gradient between the valley and the air layer aloft. During daytime, the air above the valley on the slopes is warmer than at the bottom (due to a more direct exposure to incoming radiation), which leads to upslope flows converging at the ridge tops (and can lead to cloud formation depending on the humidity of the air parcel). At night, the air above the valley cools down faster than the surface leading to down-slope motion. This means that a temperature inversion occurs at night. The temperature increases from the bottom of the valley to the ridge top and the starts decreasing only when the air parcel is free from the influence of the topography. Again, this ideal circulation can often vary due to the complex topography. Insulation of the slopes is affected by shade, aspect and sky view factor, which is the portion of the visible sky not obscured by the relief. For instance, east facing slopes receive radiation earlier in the morning than west facing slopes, which affects how the PBL grows with time and space. A very good example of down-slope winds are the Santa Ana winds, which are dry and warm winds coming from the Great Basin and Mojave desert down to coastal South California. PBL growth due to wind systems =Diurnal variation= Diurnal wind system variation in the appalachian mountain range. Diurnal variation of the PBL over a mountainous terrain. Overall, plain to mountain, up-valley and up-slope winds occurring during the day locally increase the height of the PBL. The PBL starts rising on the east facing slopes and near the ridges (warmed up by sun first and not hindered by pockets of cold air accumulated down the valley over night) and becomes more spatially homogeneous during the afternoon. Temporally speaking, the convection ends around the early evening. Clouds then starts dissipating and the Mountain- Plain circulation starts reversing into a sinking motion. The transition builds up from the surface and becomes deeper and deeper with time. The morning transition is slightly different and is the result of the combination of both the growth of the PBL and the sinking of the nocturnal temperature inversion. At nighttime, there is a limited residual layer since advection by the mountain synoptic wind system dominates. =Mountain venting= The daytime increase of the PBL from up-slope winds is called mountain venting. This phenomenon can sometimes cause a vertical exchange of the PBL air into the free troposphere. Similarly to the daytime situation, during summer the top of the mountain is warmer than its surroundings creating a low pressure zone. Winds then blow up from the plains to the mountain top, which is an efficient lifting mechanism to carry PBL pollutants into the free atmosphere. Effect of landcover Besides wind systems, the variation in land cover also plays a significant role in the PBL growth. Bare or rocky soils are not the only land cover types found in high elevation, a more complex combination of snow and/or ice and/or vegetation is often observed. On such surfaces, the radiation energy budget is highly temporally and spatially variable and so is the growth of the PBL. =Snow= Snow sublimates and creates a cold layer directly above the surface, which leads to winds blowing down-slope. Due to wind, fresh snow does not stay at the surface but is blown into the first few meters of the surface layer. This blowing snow usually sublimates due to the insulation and has a significant meteorological effect . The sublimation of blowing snow leads to a modification of the energy budget and an overall temperature decrease of 0.5 ¬∞C combined to an increase of water vapor has been observed. This forms a stable cold and moist layer of air above the snow surface, even if the surrounding air temperature is above freezing point. This cold layer induces downslope winds, which damper the growth of the PBL. This surface winds are also drifting the snowpack, leading to an increase of surface roughness and therefore an increase of wind shear (Forced convection). =Vegetation= The canopy top reflects a significant part of the incoming solar radiation, which warms up the air layer above. Low vegetation cover such as grass or shrubs are usually covered by snow during winter time or at very high elevations and the modification in surface roughness is therefore of a limited magnitude. However, dense and high forests have a significant effect on surface roughness and also on the energy budget. The turbulence created by the vegetation canopy increases the forced convection in the surface layer. The top of the canopy has a tendency to warm up faster than the air at the bottom of the valley creating upslope wind conditions just from the presence of vegetation. To summarize, the presence of snow creates down-slope winds hindering the growth of the PBL while the presence of forest creates up-slope winds facilitating the growth of the PBL.

It houses the Chantry Heritage Centre, displaying a range of exhibits relating to Gravesend, Northfleet, and the nearby villages. It is within the Fort Gardens and is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. History Milton Chantry is the oldest building in the Borough of Gravesham, in the former parish of Milton. It was built in 1322 by Aymer de Valence the Earl of Pembroke as a chantry chapel. Milton Chantry is all that remains of the Hospital of St. Mary the Virgin leper hospital. The purpose of a chantry chapel was to say prayers for the souls of the dead. Many wealthy people built chantry chapels and gave them land to generate an income, in order to maintain a priest to pray for the owner and his family. Milton Chantry The Milton Chantry housed a number of priests appointed by the Bishop of Rochester until around 1524. It was then dissolved into Crown hands as part of Henry VIII's reformation of the churches. The building then became a family home (after a few alterations) and farm, but by the end of the 17th century it had become an inn and tavern named New Tavern. Between 1780 and 1918, New Tavern Fort occupied the area around the chantry building. The tavern was converted into part of the fort's barracks. The New Tavern Fort was significantly altered between 1868 and 1871 under the direction of Charles George Gordon. The tavern and barracks were restored in 1852 and 1862. In 1932, the fort was converted into a park for the residents of Gravesend. During the World War II, the basement of the chantry chapel was converted into a gas-decontamination chamber. Following the war, the chapel was converted into the local museum named the Chantry Heritage Centre. It is under the care of the Gravesend Local History Society.

It is a rhizomatous perennial from eastern Europe. It has dark green, ribbed leaves. The branched flowering stems can be as tall as the leaves, they can hold 2‚Äì3 flowers in summer. They are yellowish-white, with brown-purple veins on the drooping falls. It is very hardy and it is commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions. There are several cultivars. Description Iris variegata has often been confused for Iris pallida 'Argentea Variegata, which has variegated leaves. But Iris variegata has variegated flowers. It has stout rhizome, with roots that can go up to 10 cm deep in the ground. It has leaves that are around 1‚Äì3 cm wide, dark green, ribbed leaves. They are slightly falcate (sword shaped). It can be variable in height in the wild (30‚Äì45 cm). Generally, it grows up to 45 cm (18 in) high, The branched flowering stems can be as tall as the leaves. There are normally 2‚Äì3 flowers per stem. The scentless flowers appear in early summer, May ‚Äì June. The perianth tube is 2‚Äì2.5 cm long. The flowers are yellowish-white, with brown-purple veins on the falls. The flowers are generally about 5‚Äì7 cm wide. The falls are obovate-oblong shaped and nearly 2 cm wide, yellow with purple or chestnut brown veins, which are darker closer to the apex. It has a yellow beard in the centre on the lower part of the fall, the standards are erect, (vary in colour) from pale yellow to bright yellow and gold. It has a seed capsule measuring 2.2‚Äì2.8 cm long by 1‚Äì1.3 cm wide, with 6 ribs along the edge. =Biochemistry= As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes. This can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n=24. Taxonomy It is commonly known as the 'Hungarian iris'. It is known as 'sk√§ggiris' in Swedish. It was once known as Iris hungarica.Robert Sweet which also applies to Iris aphylla subsp. hungarica. It was described in 1753 by Carl LinnaeusKelly D. Norris in 'Species Plantarum' (on 1 May 1753). Between 1800 and 1850, several Iris breeders (including L√©mon, Jacques and Salter), started breeding border irises for the garden. These irises were all the progeny of two species, Iris pallida and Iris variegata. It was William Rickatson Dykes who worked out that these were the parents of most hybrids, especially those bi-coloured hybrids. These new irises were known as 'Tall Bearded Irises'.} In the wild, hybrids of Iris pallida and Iris variegata are very similar to Iris germanica. Hundreds of hybrids exist representing every colour from jet black to sparkling whites. The only colour really missing is bright scarlet. Many modern garden bearded irises are crosses of 'Iris germanica' and Iris variegata. Iris variegata is an accepted name by the RHS, and it was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then updated on 20 April 2009. Distribution and habitat It is native to parts of Europe. =Range= Iris variegata is found in the Pannonian (ancient Roman province) region of central Europe. It occurs in southern Moravia, southern Slovakia, south-western Germany, southern Romania, Bulgaria, western Ukraine, Croatia, Czechoslovakia, Serbia, Hungary and Vienna, Austria . It has been introduced into Switzerland, Bohemia and Italy. =Habitat= It prefers to grow in open stony areas and amongst scrub and light woodland, and also on the sunny slopes of the steppes and beside forest margins. Conservation It is an 'endangered' and protected species in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Cultivation It is extremely hardy, as after flowering, its leaves die entirely away in the autumn and the plants remain dormant, until the spring when it regrows leaves and stems. It is best cultivated in well-drained fertile soils, but is tolerant of partial shade. It can be easily grown in gardens in Kashmir. Lifting, dividing and replanting the rhizomes is best done once flowering has finished, because this is when the plant grows the new shoots that will flower the following year. The rhizomes are placed on the surface of the soil facing towards the sun and with at least 45 cm of open ground in front of them ‚Äì this allows two years growth and flowering. The plant is held in place by removing half the leaf mass to reduce wind rock and by using the old roots as anchors in the soil. The rhizome is placed on well dug ground and the roots placed either side into 10 cm deep grooves. The soil is then gently firmed around the roots, so holding the plant steady. New roots and leaves are created rapidly as the rhizome moves forwards. It also can be propagated by seed.

He began his career as the lead singer for the Dallas-area rock band Odis, named after the famed soul singer Otis Redding. After 5 years of performing with Odis in 2010, during a short stint in Brooklyn, New York, Gayao realized that the rock genre was not the direction that he wanted to follow. He could not ignore his yearning to sing soul music. Soon after, he parted ways with the band to pursue a solo singing career. Career =2005‚Äì2010: Odis= Their first big break followed after g(EE) passed along a demo tape to on-air personality Terry Jaymes of the Lex and Terry radio show. This opportunity paved the way for the band's numerous local performances such as the 102.1 KDGE's Edgefest, which also boasts artists such as Beck, Kongos and Bastille. Odis debuted their first song titled \\"Feel\\" during an album release performance at the House of Blues in Dallas, to a sold out crowd in 2008. The group disbanded in 2010. =2010‚Äìpresent: Larry g(EE)= After leaving the rock group to pursue a solo soul-pop career, Larry needed to distinguish himself from other successful and popular acts on the music scene. He naturally gravitated towards the pseudonym Larry G, but found that the name was too close for comfort to another talented and established musical artist, saxophone player Kenny G. With the help of his brother Chester, another pseudo name took shape by simply stylizing the first initial of his last name and adding two capital \\"E's\\" in parentheses. The name and identity Larry g(EE) was born. He later collaborated with noted music producer Beau Bedford to release the Weekends EP, a sultry soul-pop album composed of four songs in 2011. In June 2014, g(EE) signed a publishing deal with Primary Wave Music, an independent music company based in New York City, known for its high-caliber publishing and music management talent. With the help of producers such as Dennis Herring and Chris Seefried, he is currently working on material for his next album. G(EE) joins the roster of many high- profile artists collaborating with Herring such as: Bruno Mars, Elvis Costello, Buddy Guy, Modest Mouse, Leonard Cohen, The Hives, Mikky Ekko, Wavves, Ra Ra Riot and Twin Shadow. Musical influences Like most successful soul-pop artists of this day, g(EE)'s influences are deeply rooted in the 1960s-era classic soul acts. Artists such as Curtis Mayfield, Sly and the Family Stone, James Brown and Joe Cocker have tremendously induced his rich soulful voice and timeless lyrics associated with his style. However, g(EE) also draws inspiration from his modern-day musical peers. From Gnarls Barkley to Charles Bradley, each artist's contribution to music has helped solidify the definition of his musical identity.

Willauer (born 1974) is an American analytical chemist and inventor working in Washington, D.C., at the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). Leading a research team, Willauer has patented a method for removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from seawater, in tandem with hydrogen (H2) removed simultaneously. Willauer is researching catalysts to enable a continuous Fischer‚ÄìTropsch process to recombine carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen gases into complex hydrocarbon liquids to synthesize jet fuel for Navy and Marine aviation, and fuel for the U.S. Navy's ships at sea. The work of Willauer's team of researchers, once the technology is incorporated into the U.S. Navy's warships in the 2020s, is expected to release such ships from their reliance on vulnerable replenishment oilers to give them indefinite time on station. Especially significant is the ability to maintain naval air operations without regular deliveries of jet fuel. A side benefit of the technology is that it will decrease harmful ocean acidification, by removing CO2 from seawater. Education Willauer attended Berry College in Georgia, graduating with a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1996. In mid-1999 she participated in the 11th International Conference on Partitioning in Aqueous Two-Phase Systems, held in Gulf Shores, Alabama.

In 1998 she studied aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) for the potential of recapturing valuable dyes from textile manufacturing effluent. She investigated ions and catalysts. Willauer at the NRL In the 2000s, Willauer began researching methods for extracting CO2 and H2 from acidified seawater (seawater having a pH value below 6), for the purpose of recombining the molecules as hydrocarbon fuels. She investigated modified iron (Fe) catalysts for dividing seawater into its component molecules, and she studied zeolite (nanoporous aluminosilicate) catalysts for recombining the molecules into fuel. Previous studies had concluded that CO2 was too stable to be economically removed from seawater, but by 2010 Willauer had discovered that an iron-based catalyst provided as much as a 50% conversion rate of available CO2 from seawater. In January 2011, the NRL placed a prototype seawater processor at Naval Air Station Key West in Florida, while Willauer continued lab research in Washington. In 2012, Willauer estimated that jet fuel could be synthesized from seawater in quantities up to per day, at a cost of three to six U.S. dollars per gallon. As well, the Navy is interested in using the technology to power its ships. In 2014, Willauer said that the catalyst could be changed to make various fuels such as methanol and natural gas, as well as the olefins that can be used as the building blocks for jet fuel. She said that about of seawater must be driven through the process to result in one gallon of jet fuel. Seawater is the optimum choice because it contains 140 times more CO2 by volume than the atmosphere, and it yields usable amounts of H2 unlike the air. The equipment for processing seawater is much smaller than that for processing air. Willauer said seawater is the \\"best option\\" for a source of synthetic jet fuel. By April 2014, Willauer's team had not yet made fuel to the standard required by military jets, but they were able in September 2013 to use the fuel to fly a radio-controlled model airplane powered by a common two-stroke internal combustion engine. Because the process requires a large input of electrical energy, a plausible first step of implementation would be for American nuclear-powered aircraft carriers (the Nimitz-class and the Gerald R. Ford-class) to manufacture their own jet fuel. The U.S. Navy is expected to deploy the technology some time in the 2020s. In 2017, Willauer was granted a patent for a carbon capture device, in the form of an electrolytic-cation exchange module (E-CEM). The E-CEM is seen as a \\"key step\\" in the production of synthetic fuel from seawater. Other researchers named in the patent are Felice DiMascio, Dennis R. Hardy, Jeffrey Baldwin, Matthew Bradley, James Morris, Ramagopal Ananth and Frederick W. Williams. Publications =Papers=      * =Patents= * Filed: December 2, 2010.

It was released on June 17, 2014, as part of the band's EP Upside Out, and is also the first single from the band's fourth studio album Hungry Ghosts. On the same day, the band released a music video in which the members use props to create optical illusions, reflecting the song's description of a relationship that fails because the couple has different points of view. Like previous OK Go videos, it is structured as a one-shot music video. The many YouTube views of the video caused the song to debut in the top ten of the US Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart, as well as number one on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. Background and composition \\"The Writing's on the Wall\\" is an alternative rock and pop rock song. OK Go frontman Damian Kulash said \\"The Writing's on the Wall\\" was written around \\"that moment in a relationship when you realize it‚Äôs coming to an end and that it‚Äôs inevitable\\", where there is the \\"feeling of having something coalesce and fall apart, like chaos and order\\". He said the song is written to be \\"melancholic and jubilant at the same time\\". The song lasts three minutes and thirty-five seconds. The arrangement of the mix consists of two heavily distorted bass guitars and drums, which producer Dave Fridmann described as \\"very standard\\". The band spent a lot of time working on the bass parts sounding distorted, which were re-tracked with a Music Man StingRay. Fridmann said \\"it was fun to track a live band because it was highly unusual for that session. We just knew that on this song, having them play together was the best way to tell whether our ideas were working.\\" Music video An example of the types of optical illusions used in OK GO's video, this specifically created by Felice Varini, in which the illusion of the floating triangles made up from painted surfaces, is achieved by viewing from a specific vantage point. The four-minute video is shot in a single take using a hand-held Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH4 camera mounted in a stabilizing Fig Rig frame, moved about by members of OK Go and assistants through a warehouse with about 28 stations consisting of everyday objects mounted on supports, clothing worn by the band, and painted walls and floors of the warehouse in specific arrangements. Each station plays on the use of optical illusions once the camera is set in position, such as trompe-l'≈ìil ones by Felice Varini that play on the illusion working from one specific point, or illusions like the Necker cube that are based on a lack of depth perception. All the illusions were created by the camera shots, without the use of any post-processing special effects. The video for \\"The Writing's on the Wall\\" was co-directed by Kulash along with Aaron Duffy and Bob Partington, creative personnel from the Special Guest and 1st Ave Machine agencies, respectively. The illusions were tied to the theme of the song, as described by Rolling Stone, \\"a pre-break-up report from a relationship in which two people keep seeing things in different ways\\". Kulash felt in planning the video that the use of illusions was a good representation of this concept. The band and crew were careful in selecting objects to use for the illusions and stuck to more common household objects, not wanting to create any unintentional meanings behind their selection that they knew some viewers would search for. In the song's bridge, the camera is mounted on a rolling device as it passes by wooden crates painted and populated with various objects, so that the words \\"I think / I understand you / but I don‚Äôt\\" appear briefly when the camera rolls by and in the correct position. Kulash emphasized this segment as \\"where the song comes out emotionally\\", and used the tighter confined space created by the crates to punctuate this segment from the larger warehouse space they had set the video in. The video was planned about two months before the set was built using computer mock-ups to explore ideas. The warehouse set was located in Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant, Brooklyn, where the band lived during the setup and filming of the video. It took about three weeks to assemble the set with the help of about 50 other people, including Kulash's father; the same crew also helped during the filming and resetting of the course between takes. During testing, they found that some concepts required fine tuning, such as positioning an apparent pile of junk as to resemble band member Tim Nordwind's face at the right angle without losing the fact that the junk was still made from common household objects. Further, Nordwind had shaved off half his beard to achieve an effect involving a mirror worn on his face, allowing him to appear as two different people. The concept of the one-shot was considered critical to the video as it provided immersion for the viewer in the unfolding of the video, making them more interested in the song. Nordwind considered this video to be the band's most difficult to film because of their involvement, including manning the camera and performing nine costume changes. The film was arranged to put most of these complicated shots where mistakes would be made at the front of the video to reduce the amount of time to reset the warehouse for subsequent takes. They had anticipated having 2 or 3 days in early June 2014 to run through multiple takes of the video, but production difficulties left them with under nine hours to complete as many takes as they could. They made about 60 attempts at the single take, working into the morning hours, and completed the full run 18 times. The final video is a take performed in the midpoint of the filming process. The music video premiered at a special presentation at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art on June 16, 2014, with its world premiere the next day via Rolling Stones website and OK Go's YouTube channel. Within a week of its premiere, the video had received over 7 million views on YouTube. The video won the award for Best Visual Effects at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. Release and reception The band released \\"The Writing's on the Wall\\" alongside three other songs as the Upside Out EP on June 17, 2014, as a teaser for Hungry Ghosts. Reviews of the song were positive upon release. Roberts Randall, writing for The Los Angeles Times, said the song's melody has a New Order feel, while Chris Conaton of Popmatters called it \\"catchy, with a compelling vocal performance from Damien Kulash and a strong lyrical premise\\". \\"Writing's on the Wall\\" debuted at the top position of Billboard's US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, an extension to the Billboard Hot 100, and in the top ten at number ten of the American Hot Rock Songs chart, marking OK Go's first entry on the chart. It was powered by 2.2 million US streams, with 92% of them coming from views of the music video. The song was featured in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Impact Apple Inc. used a similar video concept in their September 2014 keynote announcing the iPhone 6. The band has accused Apple of stealing its concept for the video, stating that they had previously gone to the computer company to obtain promotional funding for the band's video but the company turned them down. The band further contends that afterwards, Apple hired 1st Ave Machine and the same director they had used to make Apple's video. The band is exploring legal options to move forward. OK Go was hired by the Chinese furniture company Red Star Macalline to create a video advertisement using similar single-take filming and optical illusion techniques as used in the video for \\"The Writing's on the Wall\\"; the music uses a mix of another song from the Hungry Ghosts album, \\"I Won't Let You Down\\".

It currently lies south of Columbus Drive, though for the first sixty years of the cemetery's life, it extended north of Columbus. Marti-Colon has come into the news several times since its inception in the late 19th century, with reports of unscrupulous practices by owners and a lack of oversight by government officials. History In 1895, the City of West Tampa purchased land to be used as a city-run cemetery to serve the community. It was the final resting place of prominent West Tampans such as the second mayor of West Tampa, Francisco Milian. At some point, the cemetery moved into private hands, being owned and operated by J. L. Reed until 1936, when it was sold to the City of Tampa, so that the city could in turn sell right-of-way permissions through the cemetery for the expansion of Columbus Drive. The right-of-way separated the cemetery into northern and southern halves, apparently leaving several hundred bodies in the northern section. In 1959, the cemetery (now becoming known as Colon) became the center of a scandal, when city workers dumped raw sewage onto the overgrown and abandoned northern section. The operator of the cemetery at that time, A. P. Boza, leased the property from the city, and had failed proper upkeep of the separated northern section. Because of the attention the sewage dump garnered, the city decided to turn the northern section (now known as the \\"old\\" Jose Marti cemetery) into a park, apparently removing the graves from that section. In 1990, the cemetery again came into the news, when 10 adjacent lots which were sold to A. P. Boza at the time of his lease in 1939 were set to be auctioned off by the Hillsborough County Property Appraiser's Office for failure to pay taxes. The Property Appraiser's Office had been issuing notices to Boza since 1980, unaware that he had died in 1978. Upon realizing the land was in fact a cemetery, the Office cancelled the auction and sought tax exemption for the lots. West Tampa residents contacted the Office with concerns that graves would be exhumed if the tax issue was not cleared up. By 1993, the cemetery had fallen into disrepair with no one willing to maintain the Boza and City owned portions. A small sliver of the cemetery land had belonged to Garden of Memories Funeral Home, which had been maintaining the entire cemetery, but stopped due to the expense. Because Boza had not left a will when he died, his son refused to claim the cemetery property, stating that \\"[That land] is nothing but a liability.\\" Because of the outrage generated by the state of the cemetery, the City of Tampa agreed to allocate funds for its upkeep. By the end of 1993, more funds were being sought by families to pay for a security fence to help ward off vandals, after one resident reported a smashed marble angel statue on her uncle's crypt. In 1995, scandal rocked the cemetery again with an investigation by WFLA into the issue of missing graves and potential buryovers. The city conducted its own investigation, and in 2000 confirmed that buryovers had taken place, and many records of graves held by the City Clerk's Office were useless in identifying missing burials. Graves that had been moved to make way for the construction of Columbus Drive had been topped by graves during the 1960s and 1970s. Research done by radio station WFLA using materials from A. P. Boza funeral home, City records, and records from the LDS Church, concluded that 290 graves report having more than one person buried in that particular location. The City of Tampa owns the original Marti section that lies south of Columbus. In 2018 architect Patrick Thorpe purchased two acres of the Marti/Colon Cemetery for $9,500 on Craigslist. His intent is to protect it from future development and hopes to do the same for other area cemeteries.Guzzo, Paul. \\"He bought a cemetery on Craigslist.

She holds numerous patents on Electroluminescence and Electro- optics and is cited by the IEEE as being \\"well known for her innovative work in lasers.‚Äù  Personal life  Bramley was born Jenny Rosenthal in Moscow on July 31, 1909. Her parents were Lithuanian, and she and her family left Russia as part of a hostage exchange between Lithuania and the Soviet Union. She attended high school in Berlin and earned her bachelor's degree from the University of Paris in 1926 at age 16. She spoke English, Russian, French, and German and used her translation skills many times at professional meetings and to translate technical articles. Bramley received both a master's degree in 1927 and a doctorate in 1929 at age 19 from New York University (NYU). University officials at NYU said she became the first woman to receive a Ph.D in physics from an American institution. Bramley met her husband, Dr. Arthur Bramley, while working as a physicist at the United States Army Signal Corps Engineering Laboratory in Belmar, NJ. She died on May 26, 1997 at age 87 in Lancaster, PA, and is survived by a daughter, son, eleven grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.  Career  After graduating from New York University Bramley did research at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Michigan before teaching at Brooklyn College and New York University. Along with Gregory Breit, Bramley was the first to calculate the effect of extended nuclear charge on hyperfine structure and isotopic shift ‚Äì an effect still known as the Breit-Rosenthal correction. She contributed to a number of other fields including applying electroluminescence to solid state displays and storage devices and developing high efficiency lasers. Bramley also invented coding techniques and methods of decoding pictorial information, later used in classified studies. During World War II Bramley conducted some research in secret which she was unable to publish at the time. In the 1950s she worked at Monmouth Junior College where she served as head of the mathematics department.

It was released on June 20, 2014 by Dino Merlin's independent label Magaza and Croatia Records as the follow up to his 10th studio album Ispoƒçetka (2008). Production of the album was led by Dino himself alongside Yoad Nevo, Richard Niles, Baby Dooks, Marcos Ubeda, Gunnar Norden and longtime collaborators Mahir Sarihod≈æiƒá and Mahir Beathouse. Upon release the album debuted at number 8 on the Billboard World Albums List making it the only album of its kinds to be featured on this list from the region. The subsequent Hotel Nacional World Tour attracted more than 750,000 people during four years of running, an unprecedent feet in the touring industry of south-east Europe.  Background  After completing the tour Ispoƒçetka promoting his 10th studio album of the same name which sold over 700.000 tickets during the course of 4 years, Dino Merlin took a break from music and performing. The hiatus lasted for around 18 months during which most of the recording for the new album took place. In several interviews Dino described his songwriting process as being \\"organic\\" meaning that Dino, unlike many others, never consciously starts writing a song, instead he waits for \\"the song to come to him\\". Hence, the time it takes for Dino to finish a song takes considerably longer in comparison to other songwriters. In some cases, as in the songs Ispoƒçetka and Hotel Nacional, it took Dino years to finally finish them. The amount of time it takes for Dino's songs to come to fruition was evident with Hotel Nacional as it took almost 6 years to write all the songs for the album. On June 16, 2011 Dino Merlin released the single Undo. The song marked a turning point in Dino's artistic expression. Critics as well as the audience remarked that the song was unlike any other Dino Merlin produced during his career as it featured a very modern arrangement, with electronic, alternative rock and dubstep elements. The song was later included in the album. Because it was released before the other singles and because it also reliably represented the new sound of the upcoming album, Undo served as the album's de facto first unofficial single.  Recording  = Sarajevo = Recording of the album took place in Dino's studio in his hometown of Sarajevo in the neighborhood of Ilid≈æa with his longtime collaborators Mahir Beathouse and Mahir Sarihod≈æiƒá. In Sarajevo, most of the demo tracks and the album's initial sound was created during the period of two years. Sessions occurred irregularly, which was in line with Dino's timing of songwriting, with some sessions lasting up to a couple of weeks and then followed by a hiatus of several months. = Zagreb = Beside his collaborators in Sarajevo, Dino Merlin also spent a great deal of time in Zagreb operating from his apartment at park Zrinjevac. The opening single of Ispoƒçetka, the song Dabogda was produced by DJ and music producer David Vurdelja aka Baby Dooks whom Dino met at a late night studio session while wrapping up the album in 2008. The song in collaboration with Hari Mata Hari, a well known regional singer, ended up hitting the charts and becoming the biggest hit of the year in the region. Dabogda was the only song Dino Merlin worked on with Baby Dooks during the recording of album Ispoƒçetka. Their collaboration continued and resulted in producing the first major single from Hotel Nacional and probably the biggest hit on the record ≈†koljka. = London = During early 2011 Dino took a trip to London to meet his friend and music producer Srdjan Kurpjel with whom he collaborated on both Burek and Ispoƒçetka. Kurpjel introduced him to fellow London based producer Yoad Nevo who at the time worked with some of the most iconic British acts to date - Pet Shop Boys, Sugababes, Sophie Ellis-Bextor etc. Yoad Nevo while firstly recruited to produce Dino's Eurovision Song Contest entry Love in Rewind, was later involved in additional and post-production of almost all of the songs and is credited for mixing end engineering the sound for Hotel Nacional. As a result, the album Hotel Nacional is widely recognized among peers and critics to be possibly the best sound engineered album from the region in recent memory. = Stockholm = During the previous tour Ispoƒçetka, Dino participated in the Eurovision Song Contest in D√ºsseldorf performing the song \\"Love in rewind\\" in early 2011. During rehearsals he befriended the Swedish delegation and the producer of the winning song of Eurovison Song Contest held in 1999 in Jerusalem, Take me to your heaven - Marcos Ubeda. Marcos, later contributed to producing the single Hotel Nacional after which the album was named in 2014. Later during the year, Dino was also introduced to famed jazz producer Gunnar Norden, who recorded and produced the third single of the album \\"Sunce\\".  Release  During the spring of 2014 heavy flooding hit the region with Dino's home country being hit the most. Tens of thousands of people were affected and thousands of homes were destroyed. In order to raise awareness and aid money, Dino Merlin partnered with the Red Cross of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia to publish the song . The video featured footage from the effects of flooding and its disastrous consequences while featuring Red Cross telephone numbers on which money could be donated. Apart from releasing the song Ru≈æa, Dino Merlin was actively involved in alleviating the pain caused by the disasters by visiting the affected sites by flooding as well as donating to the affected population in both Bosnia and Serbia. The natural disasters that affected the region postponed the launch of the album which was planned in early May 2014. In June 2014 a campaign promoting the new album was slowly taking place. On June 15, 2014 the single ≈†koljka was published worldwide during the halftime of Bosnia's first ever football world cup performance. The song was released on YouTube, iTunes and Deezer and recorded over 100,000 YouTube views during the first 24 hours upon release. The song rose quickly to popularity and was featured in almost every halftime commercial break on national television during the world cup. Just days later, on June 19, 2014 Dino Merlin released a photo on his Facebook profile of him holding the cover of the album Hotel Nacional. The cover featured an inverted photo of Dino Merlin looking back at his childhood neighborhood of Alifakovac in Sarajevo. The following day June 20, 2014 the album was released to iTunes, Amazon and Deezer and was distributed in hard copy across the region. Accompanying the launch of the album, a renewed official website was launched, as well as a nationwide promotional campaign with billboards set all across the country. In neighboring Croatia, the album was published by the nation's biggest record label - Croatia Records. In Serbia, the sale of the album was upheld due to legal issues with the partnering record label City Records. Due to successful sales in its first week after release, the album debuted at number 8 on the Billboard World Albums list. Hotel Nacional is the first and only album from the region to be included in such a list. In this regard it represented a monumental success in Dino's career.

It is one of the oldest serving hospitals in Latin America. It was founded in 1723 in times of the colony, yet its operation dates back the 1564 and was called Hospital de San Pedro and was established with the properties donated by Bishop Juan de los Barrios. It was later called Hospital de Jes√∫s, Jos√© y Mar√≠a and finally Hospital San Juan de Dios. It initially consisted of three buildings of republican architectural style. The main building was modeled after the Pasteur Institute in France. and was finished in 1921. Later, a 1960 style high-rise building was constructed to house the hospital, and the original buildings were left abandoned. History Celebrated Colombian scientist Dr. Manuel Elkin Patarroyo's laboratory, the was located in the republican style buildings. The wing underwent remodeling and was restored to its initial architectural beauty.

It was owned and managed by a foundation, and after the national restructuring of Colombian health system into a private captive health insurance system, (known as Ley 100 de 1993) the hospital became financially insolvent mainly because it stopped receiving direct state support for uninsured emergencies and procedures for the poorest residents of the city. The bankruptcy of the hospital led to expropriation of its assets by lenders through 2006. All of the equipment of Patarroyo's laboratory was repossessed and the institute closed. The institute was re-established and relocated as the Fundaci√≥n Instituto de Inmunolog√≠a de Colombia. The Hospital was acquired by the City of Bogot√° in 2015 and currently undergoes renovation. Most of the delay has been due to legal issues surrounding the will of the donor of the land and the legal suits between the city of Bogot√°, and the Cundinamarca Department to determine ownership and the negotiations to avoid the eviction of squatters who occupied the building after its closure in addition to unsolved pensions owed to former employees. While some of the buildings cannot be demolished because of their designation as cultural and historical site the multinational firm COPASA has been hired by the city to demolish part of the complex and build a new complex. The contract was signed by mayor Claudia L√≥pez on February 2020.

His name is often spelled Kekaulahau. Biography Born around 1824, Kekaulahao was the son of A. Kaina, who was a captain of the interisland steamer Akamai. A sister of his married Jonah Kapena. Kekaulahao also had a son who died in the smallpox epidemic of 1853. A vaccination administered by a Honolulu physician failed to save the child, and he died at Lahaina after bathing in the sea to alleviate the malignant case of smallpox. The 1853 epidemic resulted in about and 2,485 reported deaths but the death toll was probably as high as five or six thousand, about eight percent of the islands' population. The Hawaiian government made smallpox vaccination compulsory in 1854. Kekaulahao was one of the first generation of Hawaiians to receive a western education by the American missionaries who arrived in Hawaii in 1820. In 1836, he began his education at Lahainaluna Seminary and graduated in 1841. Some of his classmates included writer S. N. Haleole, historian Samuel Kamakau and future royal governor George Luther Kapeau. After graduating from Lahainaluna, Kekaulahao became a practicing attorney in the early days of the kingdom. He entered the service of the Hawaiian government as a clerk for the House of Nobles in the 1846 session of the Hawaiian legislature. Throughout much of the early 1850s, he led an active career in the politics of the kingdom. In 1851, he was elected as a member of the House of Representatives, the lower house of the legislature, representing the district of  ªEwa, O ªahu. Kekaulahao would serve as a representative from 1851 to 1852. On April 14, 1853, he was elevated to the position of a member of the House of Nobles, the upper house of the legislature traditionally reserved for the chiefs, serving until 1855. Initially serving as a secretary on the Board of Land Commissioners, he succeeded Zorobabela Ka ªauwai as one of the commissioners on the board after Ka ªauwai's resignation. The board was in charge of settling or quieting land claims of the Great MƒÅhele. He served on the board from 1850 to 1855. On April 24, 1855, Kekaulahao was appointed Circuit Judge for O ªahu succeeding his cousin John Kalili, who died in office. Kekaulahao died on May 7, 1856 in Honolulu at the age of thirty-two. Two years later in 1858, he and five members of his family including his younger brother, father, son, sister, and cousin John Kalili were buried in the cemetery of the Kawaiaha ªo Church in a ceremony which included the use of Niihau mats as burial goods.

In the late 1970s, he engineered several albums with Roy Thomas Baker, eventually leaving in the 1980s to become a full-time producer.  Early life  Geoffrey Workman was born in a small household in Liverpool, Lancashire, United Kingdom. Geoff's father was Thomas Arthur Rose Workman, a drummer and a Naval Architect for the British. John Lennon, who was perhaps one of the more influential person(s) in his future music career, would occasionally eat dinner at his family's house in Liverpool. Geoff created a band during his early education called the \\"Feelgoods,\\" who would play at small local venues. John, who was at that point a part of the Beatles, invited him to tour with them as the opening act. After asking his father, Geoff remembered Thomas saying, \\"If you don't do it, you'll regret it.\\" The tour bus, which was allegedly said to have arrived at Geoff's school, was a dramatic beginning to a long career. Starting their tour in Germany, the newly found Beatles and the young Feelgoods were moved quickly around in Hamburg due to several issues, including the termination of contract by one club owner. After several years of opening for bands, including at a popular club by the name of Reeperbahn, he returned to England to work in the studio, producing for other bands. Upon finding a periodical that introduced the world of recording to him, he copied down the relevant details and applied for a job. on his first night, he was rejected, and had to sleep on a bench. The following day, he asked again, and they offered him a position, \\"swabbing toilets and bringing coffee,\\" and he agreed. His first attempt at producing was as a fill in for an album released by King Crimson, working on their album, In the Court of the Crimson King and Lizard. Eventually, after working for Wessex Sound Studios for several years engineering orchestras, commercial jingles, and local projects, he got his \\"big break\\" through being offered the chance to produce Journey.

The literature of New England has had an enduring influence on American literature in general, with themes such as religion, race, the individual versus society, social repression, and nature, emblematic of the larger concerns of American letters. History New England's rich literary history begins with the oral tradition of Native American tribes. During the colonial period, Stephen Daye set up the first British-American printing press in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and, in 1640, published the Bay Psalm Book as the first book printed in British North America. England-born Anne Bradstreet, who had settled in Massachusetts Bay Colony, there composed what was soon published as The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung Up in America. New England was the birthplace of many American Romantic authors and poets. Ralph Waldo Emerson was born in Boston. Henry David Thoreau was born in Concord, Massachusetts, where he famously lived, for some time, by Walden Pond, on Emerson's land. Nathaniel Hawthorne, romantic era writer, was born in historical Salem; later, he would live in Concord at the same time as Emerson and Thoreau. All three of these writers have strong connections to The Old Manse, a home in the Emerson family and a key center of the Transcendentalist movement. Emily Dickinson lived most of her life in Amherst, Massachusetts. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was from Portland, Maine, and Edgar Allan Poe was born in Boston. According to reports, the famed Mother Goose, the author of fairy tales and nursery rhymes was originally a person named Elizabeth Foster Goose or Mary Goose who lived in Boston. Poets James Russell Lowell, Amy Lowell, and Robert Lowell, a Confessionalist poet and teacher of Sylvia Plath, were all New England natives. Anne Sexton, also taught by Lowell, was born and died in Massachusetts. Much of the work of Nobel Prize laureate Eugene O'Neill is associated with the city of New London, Connecticut, where he spent many summers. The 14th U.S. Poet Laureate Donald Hall, a New Hampshire resident, continues the line of renowned New England poets. Noah Webster, the Father of American Scholarship and Education, was born in West Hartford, Connecticut. Pulitzer Prize winning poets Edwin Arlington Robinson, Edna St. Vincent Millay and Robert P. T. Coffin were born in Maine. Poets Stanley Kunitz and Elizabeth Bishop were both born in Worcester, Massachusetts, and Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning poet Galway Kinnell was born in Providence, Rhode Island. Oliver La Farge, a New Englander of French and Narragansett descent, won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel, the predecessor to the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, in 1930 for his book Laughing Boy. John P. Marquand grew up in Newburyport, Massachusetts. Novelist Edwin O'Connor, who was also known as a radio personality and journalist, won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his novel The Edge of Sadness. Pulitzer Prize winner John Cheever, a novelist and short story writer, was born in Quincy, Massachusetts, and set most of his fiction in old New England villages based on various South Shore towns around there. E. Annie Proulx was born in Norwich, Connecticut. David Lindsay-Abaire, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 2007 for his play Rabbit Hole, was raised in Boston. Ethan Frome, written in 1911 by Edith Wharton, is set in turn-of-the- century New England, in the fictitious town of Starkfield, Massachusetts. Like much literature of the region, it plays off themes of isolation and hopelessness. New England is also the setting for most of the gothic horror stories of H. P. Lovecraft, who lived his life in Providence, Rhode Island. Real New England towns such as Ipswich, Newburyport, Rowley, and Marblehead featured often in his stories alongside fictional locations such as Dunwich, Arkham, Innsmouth and Kingsport. Lovecraft often expressed an appreciation for New England in his personal correspondence, and believed that returning to the area was the reason that his writing improved after he left New York City. The region has also drawn authors and poets from other parts of the U.S. Mark Twain thought Hartford was the most beautiful city in the U.S. He made it his home, and wrote his masterpieces there. He lived next door to Harriet Beecher Stowe, a local most famous for the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. John Updike, originally from Pennsylvania, eventually moved to Ipswich, Massachusetts, which served as the model for the fictional New England town of Tarbox in his 1968 novel Couples. Robert Frost was born in California, but moved to Massachusetts during his teen years and published his first poem in Lawrence; his frequent use of New England settings and themes ensured that he would be associated with the region. Arthur Miller, a New York City native, used New England as the setting for some of his works, most notably The Crucible. An illustration from Herman Melville's Moby-Dick Herman Melville, originally from New York City, bought the house now known as Arrowhead in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and there wrote his novel Moby-Dick.

Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning novelist and short story writer Steven Millhauser, whose short story \\"Eisenheim the Illusionist\\" was adapted into the 2006 film The Illusionist, was born in New York City and raised in Connecticut. More recently, Stephen King, born in Portland, Maine, has used the small towns of his home state as the setting for much of his horror fiction, with several of his stories taking place in or near the fictional town of Castle Rock. Just to the south, Exeter, New Hampshire, was the birthplace of best-selling novelist John Irving and Dan Brown, author of The Da Vinci Code. Rick Moody has set many of his works in southern New England, focusing on wealthy families of suburban Connecticut's Gold Coast and their battles with addiction and anomie. Derek Walcott, a playwright and poet who won the 1992 Nobel Prize for Literature, taught poetry at Boston University. Pulitzer Prize winner Cormac McCarthy, whose novel No Country for Old Men was made into the Academy Award for Best Picture winning film in 2007, was born in Providence, although he moved to Tennessee when he was a boy. New York Times Bestselling author Dennis Lehane, another native of the Boston area, who was born in Dorchester, wrote the novels that were adapted into the films Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone and Shutter Island. Largely on the strength of its local writers, Boston was for some years the center of the U.S. publishing industry, before being overtaken by New York in the middle of the nineteenth century. Boston remains the home of legacy publishers Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and Pearson Education as well as a cadre of younger independent publishers including Candlewick Press and Charlesbridge Publishing, and was the longtime home of literary magazine The Atlantic Monthly.

Alpha Ridge is the third official landfill built in Howard County, Maryland. Howard County's first landfill was New Cut in Ellicott City, Maryland which operated from 1944 to 1980 followed by Carr's Mill, operated between 1953 and 1977. History Alpha Ridge was proposed in the late 1970s as an unpopular project that strained the public participation process to address the needs of a population expansion that would quadruple while it was in operation. The search for a third County landfill started in 1973 with opposition causing the drop of selections at Triadelphia Road and Route 144, Interstate 70 and Sand Hill Road and Henryton Road at Route 99. In 1976 the search centered around the 600-acre Burliegh Manor slave plantation purchased by future Maple Lawn developer Steward Greenbaum. Community members quit the site study claiming they were denied meaningful participation. When updating the historical status of the plantation in 1976, County archivist Cleora Barnes Thompson added \\"It should be stated here that the presence of a landfill in the surrounding area of Burliegh might not be in any way harmful as it will prevent the encroachment of future suburban development and will later provide a large area for a park, recreation or open space\\". Protests from citizens and Goodloe Byron against Clarksville, Guilford and Ellicott City sites left Marriotsville as the site with least opposition. Gibes Realty- Woodbrier Enterprises put together an offer of $3900 an acre to purchase land contracts. The Company owners, Robert and James Moxley were the original land speculators for Columbia and children of former County Chairman Norman E. Moxley. In February 1977 the Gibes-Woodbrier Alpha Ridge site was selected at the end of County Executive Edward L. Cochran's term. His wife became the realtor for the subdivision of Burleigh Manor afterward. Howard County Citizens for Conservation gathered 3000 signatures against the project and sued the county for lack of public meetings on the selection. The suit was dismissed in May with acknowledgement that meetings did not have adequate notice. In May 1979 the Maryland State Health department granted the permit for Alpha Ridge. The initial site was built on a compacted base without liners. Residents were informed that Alpha Ridge would operate until the year 2000 without expansion and be converted to a park at the end of its collection phase. BFI Recycling service started in 1989 as part of a Maryland initiative to increase recycling to 20% by 1994. The same year a $52 million project was earmarked to bring the landfill into compliance with Maryland Environmental regulations. By 1990, Alpha Ridge operations cost $75 a ton. In 1992, Howard County proposed to expand the landfill, beyond its original 2.3 million ton capacity. $11 million was budgeted to install cell liners on the remainder of the property to bring capacity up to 6.8 million tons. Citizen opposed the expansion showing documentation from 1978 that the intent was not to expand. Public hearings on expansion in February were emptied by the fire marshal for overcrowding. In 1993, Ecker sought alternatives as groundwater contamination suits were imminent. He proposed a regional trash incinerator facility with Anne Arundel County to provide power to NSA. On 8 June 1994, the County Council voted 5-0 to start transporting trash out of the county. An Anne Arundel transfer site was choose for the USA Waste residential contract and the historic Trinity Church graveyard in Elkridge was selected as a transfer station for the BFI commercial waste contract by creating a solid waste overlay zoning for the site. Alpha ridge remained in operation as hearings were held about lack of notification for the Elkridge waste transfer facility, and concerns about importing out of county residential waste. The redirection of waste at Alpha Ridge lost the $60 per ton commercial waste revenue, but reduced the residential collection expense to $33 a ton. Alpha Ridge remains open as a recycling center and transfer station. The Trinity Church trash transfer location was converted to the Blue Stream Housing development in 2014.  Environmental  The Alpha Ridge site was situated in a section of Marriottsville Maryland that was converting from mainly agricultural use to residential development. In 1987 The State granted permission to dig the landfill within 5 feet from the water table. Yearly water quality surveys were performed only in September 1978 and January 1991. By 1992, 1,600 residents in 300-400 subdivisions drew well water from the Alpha Ridge watershed. Well tests onsite in 1992 revealed contamination from seven paint and degreaser related compounds at eight times the current EPA limits and tetrachloroethene at twenty times the limits. A May 1992 test revealed that the clay lining and bedrock were not adequate to prevent contamination into the groundwater. In January 1993, the County executive claimed he had not been given the results to act upon. In 1993, the county faced multiple contamination issues, as the older Cars Mill landfill was found to have 390 drums of hazardous chemicals dumped on the landfill years after it was closed. In May 1993, Howard County Department of Planning and Zoning director Joeseph Rutter amends the county water service area to include land around the landfill including a new Donald R Reuwer development on the historic Waverly Plantation. The director announced the effort was for safety, not increased housing density around the contaminated site, but joined Reuwer's land development company later. The 72 acre park was built on landfill property on the opposite side of the Little Patuxent River that flows through the site. A ten-year plan for waste was produced in January 1994, with a suggestion to continue to receive ash from a regional incinerator. In 1994 the park required chemical toilets due to the potential of groundwater contamination. In June 1995 The County council debated providing public water hookups to local residents at no cost, or providing loans for the service. Public Works Director James M. Irvin said it would take at least 18 months to provide. A year later resident were informed they would have to pay $4200 each to connect to clean water and would pay the county in 10 years of installments at 6% interest. In 1995 Reston based SCS Engineers proposed a $15 million project to install a 68-acre thick plastic membrane over the landfill to minimize surface water from leaching. A series of 150-foot deep wells surrounding the landfill were designed to pump and \\"evaporate\\" pollutants into the air, then dump the treated water into the Little Patuxent River. Methane gas buildups would be vented to a burning facility. An additional $20 million was budgeted to perform similar remediation at Carr's Mill and New Cut landfills funded by an additional $120 trash tax implemented by Charles I. Ecker. In January 1997, Ecker announced that the plastic cap to keep rainwater out would be reduced to , excluding sloped surfaces. Three days later he flew toxicologist Laura Green in to discuss the cancer rates of the community, explaining that estrogen, sunlight, alcohol, asbestos, cigarettes and radiation are also contributors to cancer. Public water was made available for 280 homes in July 1997, with the Council excluding homes built after 1993, stating purchasers should have known the issues with contamination by then.  Post Collection  In 1994, Interstate commerce laws were enforced removing local municipalities monopolies on commercial dumping locations. Commercial operators were able to choose cheaper sites other than Alpha Ridge which charged up to $60 a ton. The County lost a dedicated source of income, leaving a liability. After dumping operations discontinued at Alpha Ridge, Howard County chose to export solid waste by an Anne Arundel County train terminal to the privately run King George County Landfill in Virginia. Howard County has adapted a number of uses to capitalize on the long term liability of managing a landfill site. The County did not rename the landfill as a park for residential development marketing like the Carr's Mill landfill site, but it did lay out over a dozen unusable dirt streets across the site to camouflage its use on street maps with names like \\"main street\\", \\"manor lane\\", \\"3rd ave\\", \\"wind drive\\", \\"river country drive\\", \\"howard drive\\", \\"back road\\". A onsite metal recycling program was initiated requiring contractors to provide daily deposits of fill-cover to the site. *1984, the County announced plans to build a $1 million horse center at Alpha Ridge as part of a larger $6.4 million park starting in 1985. By 1988, the project was listed as an unfunded 5-year project on Elizabeth Bobo's capitol project list. Regardless, citizens testified several hours in council hearings to support the project. *1994 a 72-acre park was constructed along the Northern edge. By 2004, the county deer project manager Phil Norman estimated that the park was populated with 123 deer, and recommended hiring a sharpshooter with a high-powered rifle clear the population from the landfill. In 1995, the county approved a 250 ft Nextel tower onsite with attorney David Carney claiming it would be necessary for 911 use. *1997, the county proposed building six soccer fields with a connecting road on the Southwest corner of the site which was not completed. In January 2002, County Executive James Robey proposed a $10 million fire training center on the same location. Robey announced that plans were withheld until immediately before public meetings to prevent rumors about noise or disruption in the residential neighborhoods adjacent to the facility. $500,000 in state funds were requested with the executive planning on self-funding if unapproved. When opened in 2007, the facility was named the James N. Robey Public Safety Training Center. The same year, the council voted 3-2 against building its 12th high school Marriotts Ridge High School on the Alpha ridge site. *1999, the County refinances $14.2 million in bonds borrowed to pay for the 1993 capping of the landfill. The project took until 2016 to pay down. The same year a lighted in-line skating rink is proposed on the park. *2002, the county attempted to locate its twelfth High School, Marriotts Ridge High School on the Northwest corner of the landfill, and was requested to look at Wavely Woods but a 3-2 council vote redirected the building to the Mt View Middle school site. *2008 an $150,000 onsite observatory was proposed to house the Paul Watson telescope built in the 1930s. The 12-inch telescope has been operated by the Maryland Academy of Sciences, Baltimore Astronomical Society, and the Howard Astronomical League beforehand. *2010 a $3.9 million Pepco 1059KW Gas to Energy generator was installed onsite. *2013 County Executive Ken Ulman approved a $800,000 food waste processing facility at Alpha Ridge. The facility accepts over a ton of material each day costing $38.50 to process versus $41.50 to ship offsite. The Aerated static pile composting method was developed for sludge composting, but only food waste is accepted for now. *2014, an $30,000 archery range was constructed. A program for 4-10 year olds was developed to bring younger children to the landfill park called 'Lil archers' leveraging the popularity of the movies Brave and Hunger Games. $843,000 was acquired in 2014 from the county and matching state grants to make improvements to the landfill's parking lot and bathrooms. *2014, Developer NV homes starts marketing over 55 retirement homes on the landfill site at Waverly Woods West.

S. L. Ollard. Published by the Dean and Canons of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle and Dean of Raphoe from 1776 to 1795. Family and early career He was the only surviving son of Thomas King, of Kirkby Malham, Yorkshire, where the family had lived since Rev. Robert King had arrived there as minister in 1573, in the aftermath of the Rising of the North. He attended Ripon Grammar School with his cousin, Fletcher Norton, and then accompanied Norton to St John‚Äôs College, Cambridge, where they matriculated in the summer of 1734. He took his B.A. in 1738 and was ordained to a curacy at Hamerton, Huntingdonshire. Two years later he was ordained priest and the following year took his M.A. and moved to another curacy at Barrow upon Soar in Leicestershire. In 1743 he was appointed by Sir Nathaniel Curzon to the perpetual curacy of Clitheroe, Lancashire. https://theclergydatabase.org.uk/jsp/persons/index.jsp - accessed 09/05/2020 In 1744 he married his cousin, Anne Walker, of Hungerhill, Yorkshire, and they had a family of five sons and one daughter. Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry, 18th edition, 1972, Vol. 3 (with Index to all three Volumes) ed. Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd At Clitheroe he was known as the \\"keeper of the football\\" since, on winter Sundays, he held a football in safe keeping, to prevent the game starting until after Evensong, at which point he would kick it from the church gates. M.F. Snape, The Church of England in Industrializing Society, The Boydell Press, 2003 Later career In 1770 Fletcher Norton, now a successful lawyer, was elected Speaker of the House of Commons and invited King to be his chaplain and, two years later, to take up the post of vicar of St Mary‚Äôs and Holy Trinity, Guildford. In 1774 King resigned his Guildford living when he was appointed to the third stall in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and to the rectory of Dunsfold. In 1776 he exchanged these appointments for the deanery of Raphoe in Ireland, a position that he held until his death. By this time, his family were intimate with Edmund Burke and King was instrumental in keeping Burke in touch with Irish affairs in the run up to the Catholic Relief Acts of 1778 and 1791 and in the appointment of Lord Fitzwilliam as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in August 1794. He shared Burke‚Äôs long time hope for Catholic emancipation in Ireland, which was dashed by Fitzwilliam‚Äôs recall in February 1795, shortly before King‚Äôs death Walter King - The King Family of Kirkby Malham, Askham, Umberslade & Chadshunt & the Knight Family of Barrells, 2019. Kindle Direct Publishing . His second son, Captain James King, was a friend and companion of Captain James Cook in his last voyage round the world. His third son, Walker King, was Bishop of Rochester and literary executor of Edmund Burke. His fourth son, Edward King, was Vice-Chancellor of the County Palatine of Lancaster. His youngest son, John King, was Under-Secretary of State at the Home Deptartment from 1792 to 1806 and Secretary to the Treasury in Lord Grenville's administration in 1806. In 1962, his portrait, painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1781, was given (with a portrait of his son, James, by John Webber) to the National Library of Australia in Canberra by his descendant, Edward Raleigh King, of Los Angeles.

Timlin agreed and took out a three-year lease on the property for $100 a week[4]. The existing structure on the property was built in 1912 to originally serve as a livery, since that time it was rumoured to have been a brothel, a German Club, a boxing ring and a dance hall. But most famously, as declared by the fading sign on the building's turret, it had manufactured prams in the 1920s; prompting the inspiration of the moniker The Pram Factory[5]. Timlin was to oversee the APG through most of its existence, being described as the group's \\"organiser, administrator and bagman\\"[6]. Notable APG member Bruce Spence said of him, \\"He did the things we wouldn't stoop to do. He got us the money that gave us the freedom to do what we creatively wanted. He spoke to the bureaucrats. He was the respectable face fronting all us ratbags just wanting to tear the place apart.\\"[7]. Another prominent APG member, Kerry Dwyer described Timlin as one of the \\"Irish heavies\\" in the group who \\"ran the office from the pub\\". Throughout his time with the APG, he was involved in a variety of roles for many of the productions, including construction, set design, producing and is credited as a co-creator of the outside production of 'Goodbye Ted' with Jack Hibberd and 'The Dudders' with John Romeril[8]. He was involved in the founding of an APG label, Pram Factory Productions, which co- financed the 1979 film adaptation of Hibberd's 1969 hit Dimboola. The Almost Managing Company, which acted as both literary and actors' agency for people involved with the APG, was another enterprise. After the demise of the APG in 1981, Timlin continued to work with various ex-members of the group, including producing the musical adaptation of Manning Clark's The History of Australia and many satirical live shows with Max Gillies such as A Night With The Right, The Max Gillies Summit and A Night of National Reconciliation culminating in packaging The Gillies Report for ABC television. He continued his work as director of the Almost Managing Company till its sale to Bryson Investments. In recent years Timlin has delivered much documentation regarding his work in the theatre to various museums and libraries while still working as a literary agent and editor.

Last Accessed 21 June 2014 History The broch became known to archaeologists in the 1960s. Until the beginning of the 19th century the area was covered in impassible swamps and bogs that prohibited the detailed exploration of the area.Mackie (1987) Impact on the Scottish Iron Age of the discoveries at Leckie broch, Euan W.

Description The broch is one of only a handful of brochs found in southern Scotland. Due to the destruction of the walls, it is unknown how high the original broch was. The archaeologists who excavated it believed that it was a hollowed tower type broch with an internal wood structure. The site has several phases and has been dated from the Roman period; this is known because the excavations found several kinds of dating evidence including Roman pottery, glass, coins, and radiocarbon measurements. # The first phase appears to be a hut under the later broch. A group of sheep bones in a post hole gave a C-14 date of AD 80 ¬± 70. # Construction: The broch was built next and Roman Samian pottery, with stamps, puts the construction after AD 79 or 80. # Inhabitation of the tower for roughly 60 years. # Destruction of Broch: There was evidence of a fire and sudden collapse of the broch. # Re-occupation of the broch occurs after the fire and some repairs are undertaken and a roundhouse created. # The site is fortified but then abandoned. # A medieval coin was found but it is not thought that anything significant occurred after the site was abandoned in the 2nd century AD. It has been hypothesized that it was originally a broch but after that was destroyed it was rebuilt as a promontory fort. However, some have questioned if the second phase is in fact a promontory fort. Archaeological Finds The eight years of archaeological excavations resulted in multiple finds like broochs and armlets. These finds are currently held by The Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery at the University of Glasgow.

He utilizes a range of artistic approaches including photography, performance, sculpture, and video to address concepts relating to time and society's relationship to the natural world.Scherly, Eva.  Early life and education  Charri√®re was born in Morges, Switzerland to a Swiss father and French mother. He studied art at the √âcole cantonale d‚Äôart du Valais in Switzerland before moving to Berlin to finish his degree. In 2013 he graduated from Olafur Eliasson‚Äôs Institute of Spatial Experiments in conjunction with the Berlin University of Arts.Lang, Elizabeth.  Career  Charri√®re‚Äôs research-driven practice fuses together art, science, and anthropology, highlighting the tensions resulting from our modern world. Inspired by land artists such as Robert Smithson as well as writers like author J.G. Ballard and philosopher Timothy Morton, his work contributes to a discussion of social and environmental implications of the advancements which have pushed society forward. These ideas link Charri√®re to the 19th century Romantic era during which man‚Äôs place within the world was reexamined as a response to the industrial revolution and humanist philosophy.Kiyoizumi, AJ Throughout his body of work Charri√®re experiments with nonconventional materials and methods for the symbolic significance that they carry. Time is an often used material as Charri√®re produces artworks intended to create and exist within their own timeline while commenting on their place within the broader human timescale.Ingrasciotta, Carla Interested in the concept of fossils as physical markers of time and more specifically what artifacts will be left behind to shape future generations‚Äô interpretations of his era, Charri√®re has crafted a ‚Äúgeo-archaeology of the future.‚Äù Geological specimens being the only form of documentation of Earth‚Äôs early eons, the artist reinterpreted this idea to create the series Metamorphism wherein electronic waste is molten with artificial lava and transformed into natural-looking rocks, essentially returning the technological devices to the raw materials from which they are made.Steer, Emily. This project is one of several sculptural series by Charri√®re using natural and manmade materials which provides a physical commentary on the increasingly digitalized world. Much of his work has been the result of various expeditions around the world, focusing on locations impacted by humanity. Such locations visited by Charri√®re include the Semipalatinsk Test Site, a former USSR nuclear test site, and its American equivalent, the Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Notably from these two voyages came a series of photography documenting the desolate remnants of the sites developed from analogue film exposed to nuclear materials, giving the invisible force of radioactivity a visible presence within the images.Nazif, Perwana. Crum, Maddie. Charri√®re has been the recipient of several prestigious awards. He was awarded the Kiefer Hablitzel Award during the Swiss Art Awards in both 2013 and 2015. In 2016 Charri√®re received the Kaiserring Stipendium f√ºr junge Kunst which resulted in a solo exhibition at the M√∂nchehaus Museum Goslar in Germany. In addition to working as a solo artist, Charri√®re has collaborated with other artists as well as a member of the Berlin-based artist collective, Das Numen. The collective has shown across Europe and been the recipient of numerous awards. In 2012, Charri√®re collaborated with the artist Julius von Bismarck on the site-specific performance piece Some Pigeons Are More Equal Than Others for the 13th Venice Architecture Biennale. The two have continued to work together, producing several exhibitions in tandem with one another. The artist became the subject of international news in March 2017 when Berlin police were called to his studio after the testing of his new piece commenting on peaceful scientific development and the dangers of climate change entitled The Purchase of the South Pole. The three-meter long air cannon was originally meant to shoot coconuts from the Bikini Atoll as a part of the first Antarctic Biennale. Because of its seizure the artwork never made it to Antarctica and currently remains in the custody of the German authorities.

It was first used in 1861. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"the great mistake\\" for . Description Blossoms in the Te Henui Cemetery An ordinance by the Taranaki Provincial Council dated 28 October 1861 set aside and established the first public burial ground in New Plymouth. The cemetery is the resting ground for the last eight victims of Titokowaru's War. On 13 February 1869, a war party of NgƒÅti Maniapoto led by Wetere Te Rerenga killed all three men, a woman and three children, and also the Wesleyan missionary John Whiteley who arrived shortly afterwards, at the isolated Pukearuhe Redoubt, some from New Plymouth. This was the final act of the Taranaki wars. There are two separate monuments at the cemetery that commemorate people who died in the incident. With the abolition of provincial government in 1876, the cemetery came under the control of the New Plymouth Borough Council. Today, it is controlled by the New Plymouth District Council. The main entrance to the cemetery is located at the intersection between Watson and Lemon Streets, where memorial gates were installed in 1924 on the request of Alice Honeyfield, a former resident then living in Sydney. The cemetery contains the Commonwealth war graves of 12 men who served in the First World War, and 19 men who served in the Second World War.

X band is used because it provides a compromise between the characteristics of different frequency bands which is particularly suited to the needs of military users. The characteristics include interference and rain resilience, terminal size, data rates, remote coverage and whether it is reserved for governmental use.  Characteristics of the SHF frequency band  = Frequency = x Band Satellite Communication operates in the part of the X band or Super High Frequency (SHF) spectrum which is designated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) for satellite communication, which is those frequencies in the range 7.25 GHz to 7.75 GHz (Space to Earth) and 7.9 GHz to 8.4 GHz (Earth to Space). The ITU Frequency allocation defines the primary use of this spectrum as Fixed satellite service (FSS) and a portion to Mobile Satellite Services (MSS), primarily used for ship based satellite communications. UK Frequency Allocation Table (UK FAT) along with other NATO countries and some other countries‚Äô (but not all) national frequency allocations tables, have an additional note detailing the primary allocation for government use. It is important to note that the allocation of these frequencies and services is for government use and not, as commonly stated, military use. The ITU and the UK Ofcom considers military use as just one part of government use. = Rain resilience = X band is below those frequencies which are severely affected by Rain Fade, therefore X band provides extremely good rain resilience unlike higher frequencies such as Ku or Ka which are also used for satellite communication. This allows extremely high link availability, in some cases as high as 99.9% = >4¬∞ separation between satellites = X band satellites typically have at least 4¬∞ separation between satellites, therefore there is less chance of adjacent satellite interference (ASI) and higher power density carriers allowed. = Terminal size v data rates = As with any satellite communication link, the data rate that can be achieved with a terminal is dependent on the gain of the parabolic antenna. Antenna gain increases with the square of the ratio of aperture width to wavelength. Therefore, for a fixed antenna size the gain, and hence the achievable data rate increases with frequency. Thus X band provides data rates which are much higher than can be achieved with UHF, L band, or C band. The achievable data rates will approach those achievable with Ku band, the exact values will depend on other link parameters (satellite power, link margin, modulation scheme, etc.). Therefore, X band provides a good compromise between terminal size and data rates while maintaining resilience to rain fade. Data rates of 10Mbit/s are achievable to a 45 cm antenna without interfering with adjacent satellites. National Frequency Planning Group on behalf of the Committee on UK Spectrum Strategy = Remote and maritime coverage = X band spot beams typically have a diameter of 1000 km or more. This is the result of the frequency and the size of Parabolic antenna which can be accommodated inside satellite launch vehicles. This means that a single beam is able to be steered to cover an entire region of interest. X band satellites also have an earth cover or global beam providing coverage of the entire planet that is visible from the satellite. This is in contrast to satellites in commercial bands which typically provide fixed beams for areas of high density of users. Therefore, X band satellites are able to support users in remote areas with little or no infrastructure and in mid ocean away from land and shipping lanes.  Characteristics of SHF Satcom systems  SHF Satcom systems often possess features designed to meet the needs of military users and to counter threats to the system. Features include * Steerable beams * High power spectral density * Protection against nuclear events and space weather * Military grade cryptography on the telecommand system * Protection against laser threats * Military specification control facilities * Protection against jamming attacks * Flexible connectivity  Components of SHF Satcom systems  Like other Satellite Communications X band satellite communication systems comprise the following segments Satellite space segment: the satellite which comprises the platform and the payload * Control Segment: the ground equipment to control the satellite * Anchor facilities: while mesh configurations are possible most X band satcom systems use anchor facilities to exploit the link budget benefits from large antennas and to provide terrestrial connectivity * Network management: the facilities to manage the communication network in particular the baseband elements * User terminals: the terminals used by deployed users to connect to the satellite system. User terminals may be interoperable with several different X band systems. User terminals are adapted to the requirements of the environment in which the operate  Satellite communication systems operating at X band  = Skynet = The Skynet fleet of satellites are owned and operated by Airbus Defence & Space who hold a long term concession for beyond line of sight communications with the UK MOD. The fleet includes four high performance Skynet 5 satellites with 160W TWTAs providing up to 8W/MHz and an active receive antenna capable of creating multiple uplink beam patterns. The Skynet fleet also includes older Skynet 4 satellites which are beyond their original design life and in inclined orbits, these orbits enable them to provide communications to arctic and Antarctic regions. In addition to SHF capacity the Skynet satellites also have UHF capacity. = Wideband Global SATCOM system (WGS) = The WGS system is a constellation of military communications satellites procured by the U.S. Air Force MILSATCOM Systems Directorate at Los Angeles Air Force Base (AFB). Each WGS satellite provides capacity in both the X and Ka frequency bands. Each WGS satellite is digitally channelized and transponded. International partners participating on the program are Australia, Canada, Denmark, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and New Zealand. = XTAR-EUR = The XTAR-EUR satellite is owned and operated by XTAR LLC. It was launched in February 2005 and is positioned at 29 degrees east. XTAR-EUR has 100W, 72 MHz transponders = Spainsat = SpainSat is owned by Hisdesat. SpainSat was launched in March 2006 and is positioned at 29 degrees west. Spainsat has an X-Band payload with 100W, 72 MHz transponders. It also has Ka band capacity. = Sicral = SICRAL (Sistema Italiano per Comunicazioni Riservate ed Allarmi) is Italy‚Äôs satellite system for military communications. The SICRAL 1 satellite was launched in 2001 and the SICRAL 1B satellite was launched in 2009. = Syracuse = Syracuse III (syst√®me de radiocommunications utilisant un satellite) is the military satellite communication system of the French ministry of Defence. Syracuse 3A was launched in 2005 and Syracuse 3B was launched in 2006. = Anik G1 = Anik G1 was launched in April 2013, and includes a 3-transponder, global-beam X-band payload, operating from 107.3¬∞W. = DC-MS Series 2 = DC-MS Series 2 consists of 2 triple-transponder global-beam X-band payload, operated by Delta Communications. DC-MS Series 2 was launched in January 2014. = NATO SATCOM Post-2000 = The NATO X Band satellite system consists of a NATO owned ground segment with capacity leased from a consortium formed by the British, French and Italian governments.
