The Colonial Houses of Worship in America. New York: Hastings House, Publishers, 1963, p. 231. \\"109 East Hoosac Friends Meeting House (1786) Adams, Berkshire County, Massachusetts\\" The meetinghouse's construction dates to the early 1780s. It now occupies a prominent position within the Maple Street Cemetery (also listed on the National Register of Historic Places), the first burial ground in Adams. Unmarked graves of Adams' early Quaker settlers lie near the meetinghouse, an area now marked by a plaque. The meetinghouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The Quaker Meetinghouse occupies a prominent position overlooking the Maple Street Cemetery from a high point near its western end. It is a simple rectangular two story wood frame building measuring by . In typical Quaker fashion, both the interior and exterior lack any significant ornamentation. The exterior is finished in wooden clapboards, and has an asymmetrical main facade with two entrances, one for men and one for women. The doors and outside window shutters are made of simple wooden planking. A chimney pierces the roof ridge near the building's western end. The interior was partitioned to separate the men from the women, although portions of the divider were movable. Seating consisted of benches, and there were fireplaces located on the women's side of both floors. Adams was first settled by Quakers, mostly from the area of Smithfield, Rhode Island, in the 1760s, and was originally known as East Hoosac. The present meetinghouse dates to 1784, and remained in active use until 1842, when the local Quaker population was in decline. The area of the cemetery near the meetinghouse has archaeologically been determined to have unmarked graves of Quakers (a common practice of time) dating to the 1760s. Relatives of noted suffragette Susan B. Anthony, who was born in Adams, are buried here.

It is the fourth church of a congregation whose first meetings were held in 1743. History In 1743 the congregation was founded by Samuel Hopkins, an early proponent of the theology of New Divinity. In 1883 the current stone church building was completed after a fire destroyed most of the previous structure, which had been built of locally quarried stone in 1859. In 1883 the congregation also accepted the donation by the Hopkins family of a house to be used as a parish hall. This building, also faced in local stone, was designed by Peabody & Stearns, and was previously located across the street from the church before being moved to its present location next to the church. In the 1880s the church sponsored congregant W. E. B. Du Bois as he attended Fisk University. In 1992 the church building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Architecture The church is set in the heart of downtown Great Barrington, facing west toward Main Street. The church, along with its manse and carriage house, are all built of locally quarried limestone. The church is two stories in height, with a longitudinal nave whose walls are supported by buttresses. Its roof is steeply pitched, and covered in slate. A five-story tower, in height, rises at the southwest corner, and is topped by a pyramidal roof with flared edges. The church was built in 1883, using parts of the previous (1859) structure, which was built from stone sourced at the same quarry, and was destroyed by fire in 1882. The church was designed by William C. Brocklesby, an architect practicing in Hartford, Connecticut. The manse and carriage barn, added in 1884, were designed by Peabody and Stearns of Boston.

Location and description The New Guinea mangroves cover an area of , particularly among the river mouths of the island's south coast. This ecoregion contains the greatest diversity of mangrove species in the world and they are an important habitat for wildlife. Areas of mangroves on the northern coast of New Guinea can be found at the mouths of the Sepik and Ramu rivers on the eastern side of Cenderawasih Bay, and Dyke Ackland Bay and Ward Hunt Strait. However the largest areas are found on the south coast in the mouths of the Purari, Kikori, Flys as well as Bintuni Bay and other areas of the southern Bird's Head Peninsula. Some areas such as the Kikori delta have larger and thicker mangroves than others. Climate The coast of New Guinea has a Tropical monsoon climate apart from the length of drier Trans-Fly savanna and grasslands coastline on the south coast. The growth of mangroves Mangroves depend on a complex series of dynamic natural tidal processes that create the conditions for their survival. Rivers depositing sediment, together with waves and coastal currents, reshape the tidal zone where mangroves thrive. There are several features that all species of mangroves have in common. These include tolerance to conditions of high soil salinity, tolerance to submergence in water, or waterlogged soil, and to low oxygen conditions. The use of water to disperse young plants is also very characteristic of mangroves.\\"Mangrove Swamps.\\" U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 21 Oct 2008 Web.12 Apr 2009. . As a result of the water-logged soil that mangrove trees reside in, they have formed adaptations to help them survive. For example, black mangroves survive in water-logged soil by using special \\"root snorkels\\" called pneumatophores. These structures are covered with small holes call lenticels that allow the roots to breathe the same way a snorkel lets you breathe while underwater.\\"Mangrove Swamps.\\" U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 21 Oct 2008 Web.12 Apr 2009. . When trying to overcome the obstacle of the salinity that these trees live in, they have a few adaptations. They can actually concentrate much of the salt concentration in older leaves, which are soon to fall off, taking the excess salt with them. Some species even have salt glands which excrete salt to the surface of the leaves allowing it to be washed away by rain.\\"Plant Diversity-Mangroves.\\" Wet Tropics Management Authority 2002-2006 Web.12 Apr 2009. . Mangroves begin as a seed called a propagule, which germinates while still attached to the tree. The seed has a long cylindrical shape that falls off the parent tree and either sticks in the mud growing next to the parent tree, or floats off to sea. These seeds have a very strong, protective covering that allows them to float and survive for long distances and periods of time. The seedling may finally reach a point of its destination where conditions are favorable, and the roots will begin to bury into the ground, forming a new mangrove tree.Maikut, Diana. \\"Ecology of Mangroves.\\" 04 Jun 2004 Web.12 Apr 2009.. The dispersal of these \\"live\\" young trees is called vivipary, or birth of live young, very similar to mammals.Maikut, Diana. \\"Ecology of Mangroves.\\" 04 Jun 2004 Web.12 Apr 2009. . Flora The range of newly deposited and well- established areas, varying water depth, and variations in salinity from the mixing of salt and fresh water create a diversity of habitats that are home to different mixes of species. On the shoreline pioneering species like the Avicennia species Avicennia alba and Avicennia marina are usually the first to establish on coastal shores, with Sonneratia growing in the coastal tidal creeks. Their complex root networks encourage further sedimentation and growth which then creates shade that allows Rhizophora mucronata to establish itself, ultimately supplanting the shade-intolerant Avicennia and Sonneratia. Then Rhizophora apiculata and Bruguiera parviflora, (and occasionally Bruguiera gymnorhiza) are the next in succession but still in waters that are more than 10% saline. Mature mangrove forests include Xylocarpus, Lunmitzera, and Heritiera. Papuan mahogany Xylocarpus granatum can form monotypic stands, reaching up to 20 meters in height, with buttressed trunks up to a meter across. Where freshwater flows create a less salty brackish environment the mangrove palm Nypa fruticans is common, together with Xylocarpus granatum and Heritiera littoralis. Mangrove forests bordering freshwater swamp forests include Bruguiera sexangula, Camptostemon schultzii, Dolichandrone spathacea, Diospyros spp., Excoecaria agallocha, Heritiera littoralis, Rhizophora apiculata, and Xylocarpus granatum, along with typical freshwater swamp forest species, such as Calophyllum spp., Kwila (Intsia bijuga), Myristica hollrungii, and Amoora cucullata. Fauna These continuously changing woodlands do not have a great variety of mammals, although the greater sheath- tailed bat (Emballonura furax) is a near-endemic. Many species of birds also inhabit these forests including the New Guinea flightless rail, while endemic or near-endemic birds include the red-billed brush-turkey, Wallace's fruit- dove, western crowned pigeon, Salvadori's fig parrot, black lory, brown lory, Papuan swiftlet, red-breasted paradise-kingfisher, white-bellied pitohui, and the olive-crowned flowerpecker. Reptiles recorded from the New Guinea mangroves on Daru and Bobo (Bristow) Islands, Western Province, PNG, during survey work were the estuarine crocodile (Crocodylus porosus), littoral skink (Emoia atrocostata), mangrove monitor (Varanus indicus), amethystine python (Morelia amethistina), crab-eating mangrove snake (Fordonia leucobalia), and Richardson's mangrove snake (Myron richardsonii). All are species strongly associated with southern New Guinea mangroves. Ecological importance Mangrove forests act as a \\"natural cleaner\\". For example, they intercept land- derived nutrients, pollutants, and suspended matter before these contaminants reach deeper water. They also prevent coastal erosion by stabilizing sediments Valiela, Ivan, Bowen, Jennifer, York, Joanna. \\"Mangrove Forests: One of the World's Threatened Major Tropical Environments.\\" American Institute of Biological Sciences 2001 807-815.. provide nursery and spawning areas for commercially important fishValiela, Ivan, Bowen, Jennifer, York, Joanna . \\"Mangrove Forests: One of the World's Threatened Major Tropical Environments.\\" American Institute of Biological Sciences 2001 807-815. and provide stop over sites for organisms such as migratory birds, mammals, and fish.Valiela, Ivan, Bowen, Jennifer, York, Joanna. \\"Mangrove Forests: One of the World's Threatened Major Tropical Environments.\\" American Institute of Biological Sciences 2001 807-815. . Threats and preservation Even though this thick forest is hard to penetrate about 35% of the mangrove forests have been lost in the past two decades. These losses exceed those for tropical rain forests and coral reefs. Mangrove trees grow on a narrow strip between land and ocean in river systems, between the latitudes 25 degrees N and 30 degrees S, and the constant renewal of the trees relies on rivers bringing nutrients to the coast in regular seasonal patterns. The limited distribution of this ecosystem adds to the delicacy of it. Many global changes such as an increased rise in sea water is largely thought to be responsible for the destruction of these mangrove forests. A few other factors such as mariculture, agriculture, and urbanization have also contributed to the recent loss of mangrove habitats. Mangroves provide humans with shrimp, fish, honey, lumber, and reptile skins. Without this tropical habitat, many of these products would be reduced in our market.Valiela, Ivan, Bowen, Jennifer, York, Joanna. \\"Mangrove Forests: One of the World's Threatened Major Tropical Environments.\\" American Institute of Biological Sciences 2001 807-815. Threats to mangroves in Bintuni Bay and on Daru and Bobo (Bristow) Islands, Western Province, PNG, includes cutting for firewood and charcoal burning. Cutters travel by canoe up creeks into the interior of the mangrove forest and clear-fell large areas of trees which from the outside appear untouched. The timber is sold in the market on Daru, an island which is home to 10% of the Western Province population i.e. some 15,000 people including immigrants from Indonesian New Guinea (Papua). It is doubtful the mangrove forests can sustain this level of harvesting. Kwila (Intsia bijuga) and Papuan mahogany have more valuable timber and so are more vulnerable. Many steps around the world are being taken in an effort to conserve mangrove forests from being completely wiped out. Some of these efforts include replanting of trees by local communities, and the development of sustainable use systems within a community. This practice includes using resources from mangroves that is at a rate in which the ecosystem can recover.Maikut, Diana. \\"Ecology of Mangroves.\\" 04 Jun 2004 Web.12 Apr 2009. .

Built in 1888 for a congregation organized in 1793, it is a prominent local example of Romanesque architecture, funded by Gilded Age summer congregants. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. History The first known Episcopalian church services to take place in Lenox were in 1763; it was not until 1793 that a congregation was organized. Its first building, similar to a typical colonial meeting house, was built in 1818, and survives in somewhat altered form as a commercial building on Church Street. The congregation remained small until after the American Civil War, when wealthy residents of large cities began summering in Lenox. The church was enlarged in 1873, but by 1882 it was again judged too small. Robert Auchmuty, a congregant who had apprenticed with architect James Renwick, Jr., headed the committee that oversaw design and construction of the replacement. Auchmuty worked with Charles Follen McKim of McKim, Mead & White to develop plans for the church, and supervised its construction. It was built in 1888 in the Gothic Revival style for the use of a congregation composed in part of the wealthy summer visitors to The Berkshires, who funded its construction. The church was the location of society weddings. For example, on June 6, 1895, James A. Burden II, an heir to the Burden Iron Works, wed Florence Adele Sloan, a direct descendant of Cornelius Vanderbilt, in this church.

Prince Ferdinando of Savoy, 3rd Duke of Genoa (Ferdinando Umberto Filippo Adalberto; 21 April 1884 - 24 June 1963) was the third Duke of Genoa and a member of the House of Savoy. He was an admiral in the Royal Italian Navy. Early life Prince Ferdinando was born in Turin the eldest son of Prince Thomas of Savoy, Duke of Genoa (1854-1931) and his wife Princess Isabella of Bavaria (1863‚Äì1924). On 22 September 1904 he was given the title Prince of Udine. Ferdinado pursued a career in the Italian Royal Navy. Holding the rank of Captain he served in World War I commanding a Torpedo Boat Destroyer and was decorated with a medal of honour for personal bravery. In May 1917 with War raging in Europe, Prince Ferdinando was appointed to lead an Italian War Commission to the United States of America. The commission which included Guglielmo Marconi and leading Italian political and commercial figures, visited America with the task of discussing financial and trade agreements and increasing co-operation between the two nations to help the Italian war effort. Post war In the autumn of 1927 Mussolini despatched the Prince of Udine to Tangier, Morocco in command of a naval squadron of three warships to demonstrate Italy‚Äôs interest in the city. In November 1930 he represented his cousin King Victor Emmanuel III at the coronation of Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia. Prince Ferdinando succeeded to the title Duke of Genoa on 15 April 1931 following the death of his father. Later on in his naval career Prince Ferdinando achieved the rank of admiral, and become commander of the upper Adriatic sea. He married in Turin on 28 February 1938, Maria Luisa Alliaga Gandolfi dei conti di Ricaldone (11 October 1899 in Fossano ‚Äì 19 July 1986 in Turin), an Italian noblewoman. Maria Luisa was a daughter of Carlo Gandolfi di Ricaldone, Count of Borghetto, Montegrosso and Pornassio, and Emma Teresa Luisa Cavalli.Maria Luisa Alliaga Gandolfi, The Peerage They had no children. The reign of the House of Savoy in Italy came to end on 12 June 1946 after a referendum was held and the Italian people voted to abolish the monarchy.

Winterization is a type of fractionation (also known as fractionate crystallization), the general process of separating the triglycerides found in fats and oils, using the difference in their melting points, solubility, and volatility. Winterization is an oil refinement technique commonly used in biotechnology. The process involves dissolving the extract in ethanol, then placing the mixture in a freezer to chill. The cold allows for the separation of compounds by differences in their melting and precipitation points. In the cooling process, the fats and waxes with higher melting points will precipitate out and can then be removed by filtration, centrifugation, decantation, or other separation processes. A pure, liquid oil extract is left behind, ready to be further processed for consumer use.  Bioindustry Applications  Food products containing non-processed oils, such as fats and waxes with higher melting points, will crystallize in refrigeration temperatures. This precipitation could result in products like salad dressings separating during cold storage. Winterization is used to refine oil in salad dressings, mayonnaise, cooking oils like sunflower oil, and botanical oils. Rice bran oil is one of the most commonly winterized oils, as it has a high content of waxes, fatty acids and lipids. Winterization is also used in refining biofuel, as it improves low temperature flow properties. This is necessary in preventing crystallization of certain compounds in the fuel, which could cause problems with compression engines. Winterization is also a common process in the cannabis industry, used to remove unwanted compounds from cannabis oil extracts. Winterization often follows supercritical CO2 extraction, for the production of cannabis oils to be used in vape pens and capsules.

He sits in the Argentine Senate representing Tierra del Fuego Province in the majority block of the Front for Victory and was formerly governor of that province. Colazo attended primary school in C√≥rdoba before moving to R√≠o Grande, Tierra del Fuego for his secondary education. He was involved in various community organisations. During the Falklands War he served in civil protection in R√≠o Grande. From an early age, Colazo was involved in the UCR and held senior positions in the party at provincial and national levels. From 1989 to 1991 he served as a R√≠o Grande councillor and in 1991 he was elected Mayor of R√≠o Grande, serving until 1999. In that year he stood as candidate for governor of the Province. From January 2000 he worked as head of the Social Services for Pensioners for the Province until 2001. In 2001 Colazo was elected as senator. Then in 2003 he was elected as governor of the province, defeating incumbent Peronist Carlos Manfredotti and taking office in January 2004 with Hugo C√≥ccaro as his vice-governor. Although a Radical, he was by now identified with the attempt at political consensus of the new President, Peronist N√©stor Kirchner, and was seen as one of the leading 'Radicales K'. Indeed, C√≥ccaro was a Justicialist, although he had been a supporter of the anti-Kirchner Peronist leader Adolfo Rodr√≠guez Sa√° against Kirchner for the Presidency.Tierra del Fuego: suspendieron al gobernador Colazo y asumi√≥ el vice, Clar√≠n, 10 September 2005. The relationship between Colazo and C√≥ccaro soon deteriorated, to the extent that Colazo even accused his deputy of involvement in plans to assassinate him. Colazo had also been isolated from his party, who had suspended him for his links with the Peronists. He was put under investigation by the provincial legislature for misuse of municipal funds in R√≠o Grande and for bypassing the legislature when making budget decisions in 2004, and in September 2005 he was suspended as governor. He was impeached in December 2005 and C√≥ccaro formally took over. In 2007 Colazo stood for and was re-elected to the Senate, heading the Federalist Union list. He sits with the Kirchners' Front for Victory. However, in March 2008, a Tierra del Fuego court requested that the Senate expel him in connection with the ongoing allegations relating to improper use of funds while Mayor of R√≠o Grande.Piden el desafuero del ex gobernador Jorge Colazo, Clar√≠n, 5 March 2008.

He was credited with 30 enemy aircraft shot down, shared in the destruction of three others, and claimed 6 damaged and another two shared damaged. His 20 kills achieved while flying the Hawker Hurricane and his 10 with the Gloster Gladiator made him the second highest scoring Hurricane and biplane pilot in the RAF, in both cases after Marmaduke Pattle. Early life and career Born in Chatham, Kent, William Vale entered the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1931 as a fitter and then as a gunner. His RAF service number was 565293. In 1935 he was posted to No. 33 Squadron RAF in Egypt, equipped with the Hawker Hart. In 1936 he began training as a pilot at No. 4 Flying Training School, Abu Suwayr. He returned as a sergeant pilot to No. 33 Squadron in late 1937. In March 1938 the unit converted to the Gloster Gladiator. Second World War Combat operations Based in Egypt at the beginning of the war and by then a temporary flight sergeant, Vale flew operations over the Libyan border. He received a permanent commission in the RAF with the rank of pilot officer (probationary) on 24 June, service number 44068. Between 1 July 1940 and 28 February 1941 Vale claimed 10 Regia Aeronautica aircraft in the Gladiator, although several of his victories cannot be traced through fragmented Italian records. He claimed his first victory on 1 July 1940, a Fiat CR.32 over Fort Capuzzo. But this claim cannot be verified with Italian sources as the 50¬∞ Stormo, the only unit operating this type, did not suffer any losses on this day. On 15 July, during a defensive patrol, he claimed a shared Savoia- Marchetti SM.79 near Mersa Matruh. The Italian unit involved is not known and this claim cannot be verified with Regia Aeronautica records. Squadron Leader William \\"Cherry\\" Vale In July, Vale was posted to No. 80 Squadron RAF. He saw action over Greece and the Balkans through late 1940 and early 1941, and flew over Crete in May 1941 in defence of the island. Between 3 March 1941 and 12 June 1941, Vale claimed some 20 kills, all while flying the Hawker Hurricane. Some of these victories however remain to be confirmed. For instance, on 4 March 1941 he claimed a Fiat G.50 destroyed over Himare-Valona, in Albania, while flying Hurricane V7589. The Regia Aeronautica did not report losing any G.50. types. On 18 May, Vale was evacuated from Crete to Egypt. He then flew operations over Syria against the Vichy French and three of his kills were Vichy French Air Force aircraft. On 11 June 1941 Vale claimed a Potez 63 of GR II/39, which was damaged. Next day he claimed two Dewoitine D.520 fighters near Haifa. With the chaotic retreats from Greece and Crete official RAF records‚Äîincluding combat reports‚Äîwere destroyed, making many pilot's claims for enemy aircraft destroyed impossible to verify. However Vale's claim total appears to be around 30 destroyed with 3 shared destroyed, 6 damaged and 1 shared damaged. But at least seven of his claims cannot be verified with Regia Aeronautica and Luftwaffe records. Vale had fought in the North African Campaign, Greek Campaign and the Battle of Crete. Vale did not participate in combat operations for the remainder of the war. Vale was promoted to flying officer (war substantive) on 24 June 1941. Awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross on 28 March 1941 and bar on 11 July 1941. His citation in the London Gazette states: Instructional duties Vale was posted to RAF Haifa as operations officer, returning to the United Kingdom in April 1942 to become Chief Flying Instructor at No. 59 Operational Training Unit. He was promoted to flight lieutenant (war substantive) on 17 January 1942. In March 1943 Vale attended the Central Gunnery School at Sutton Bridge, then commanded 11 AFC at Fairwood Common until the end of the war. Acting Squadron Leader Vale was awarded the Air Force Cross on 1 September 1944 for his achievements in training duties. Post-war In 1946 he was officer commanding gunnery and armament testing at West Raynham, but he left the service in October. He retired from the RAF as a squadron leader on 3 June 1959. He lived in Nottinghamshire for some years, and was killed in a road accident on 29 November 1981. References Citations Bibliography  * * * Further reading * Cull, Bill.

Album information Introducing the world to the unique soulful spunk that was Honey Cone was what \\"Take Me with You\\" achieved. Their lead single \\"While You're Out Looking for Sugar,\\" (released in 1969) sums up both the lyrical and musical approach that made the band so distinctive.

This time period marked a downward spiral that would eventually put the freshly developed record label out of business permanently the following year. A few sources report that the reason for this pending expiration was that the independent distributors weren't paying up when it came to royalties from radio play and record sales.

Biography Born in Nortorf, Sommer joined the Hitler Youth at sixteen, and joined the SS #119 157 (1 December 1932) and NSDAP #1442457 (1 February 1933), respectively. He was chiefly in function of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) before his service in the Wehrmacht (1936‚Äì38). Afterwards, he became a deputy to Otto Somann at SD Leignitz, followed by a stint in Breslau.

She and her two dorm-mates are the only three survivors of a campus- wide zombie plague, but Joss has a strong understanding of the \\"Rules\\" of zombie movies. Using the rules, they will survive. Zombies Calling is a more humorous take on zombie stories, similar to the zombie film Shaun of the Dead. Plot Joss, Sonnet and Robyn are all dorm-mates at London University, a university in southern Ontario. Joss is studying for exams, but while on a snack run, she's nearly overrun by zombies. Initially afraid, the \\"First Rule of Zombie Movies\\" kicks in for Joss: confronted with zombies, ordinary people will transform into tough, adept and ruthless fighters. Joss survives the attack and runs back to her dorm in a panic, but Sonnet and Robyn don't believe her. The zombies have since dispersed, and are nowhere to be seen. Later, during the exam, the zombies return. Joss gets Sonnet and Robyn, and they barricade themselves in their dorm, since the nearest mall is too far away (another Zombie Rule: \\"Never leave the mall\\"). The phones are out, according to another Rule, so they remain in the dorm room. Meanwhile, the Canadian Army are figuring out what to do about the zombies. A high-ranking officer mentions that his son, Robyn, can \\"turn the tide of a Zombie invasion\\". The next morning, the zombie epidemic is just as bad. Joss wants to stay in the dorm and await rescue, but Sonnet and Robyn know another Rule: no one ever rescues the survivors. They make a break for it, armed only with a spork. Soon, however, they're surrounded. As the Zombies close in, Joss' English professor emerges, and explains that he created the zombie epidemic by poisoning the coffee at the campus coffeehouse as a statement about the cheapening of higher education: few university students care any more about education, and would rather just pay for a degree. They are figurative zombies, so the professor has turned them into literal zombies. Just then, the Army launches air strikes to purge the zombies. Joss, Sonnet and Robyn still need to get away, however, so Joss follows another Zombie Rule: sacrifice yourself to lead the zombies away. The zombies corner her in the university library, which is then bombed. Joss survives the collapse, and wakes up a few weeks later in the hospital. The university is in ruins after a large portion of its student and faculty population became zombies and were purged. Mortified to hear this, Joss decides to vacation in England. The Canadian government has paid for Joss' trip to England. There she meets a boy wearing a Canada T-shirt, and they go walking along the Thames together. Characters Joss - Short for Jocelyn, she is the story's protagonist. She's energetic and bizarre, and also courageous and quick-witted. She's constantly worried about her student loan and has a perpetual obsession with England, always wearing a Union Jack tank top, and peppering her vocabulary with British slang. She has strong knowledge about zombie movies, which proves invaluable to their survival. She also has a strong emotional side later in the story. Sonnet - Joss' friend. She's mildly Goth, having black-dyed hair and an interest in writing macabre poetry, but is very sly and chipper. She's the most confused and horrified by the zombie plague. Robyn - Joss' roommate. He's a slacker, overly excitable, and is blissfully unaware of the danger around him. He's also somewhat of a pervert; Joss suspects that Robyn likes to root through her underwear drawer, and he has a dream of making love to Belinda Stronach. His parents have a mysterious position of authority in the Canadian Army, and they organize an offensive against the zombies. The Professor - Although never named, the Professor is Joss' teacher, and he's the one that has created the zombie plague. He is also able to control the zombies, since they view him as their leader. He's very smarmy, and usually refers to his students as \\"children\\". The other characters think he's completely insane for having created a zombie infestation to \\"make a point\\". The Rules \\"The Rules\\" are a list of zombie movie clich√©s that play an important role in Zombies Calling. These are the ones mentioned in the story: *Rule One - When confronted with zombies, an ordinary person will transform into a strong and wild fighter, regardless of occupation, personality, or athletic ability. *Rule Two - One of the survivors will sacrifice him or herself to distract the zombies, so that the other survivors can escape. Usually, it's the story's protagonist. The remaining Rules are not numbered: * The best way to wait out a zombie plague is to barricade yourself inside a mall (however, in this story it's a college dormitory), and you should never leave. * The survivors always fight the zombies. * Guns will suddenly become readily available (however, they never do in this story). * No one ever refers to the zombies as \\"zombies\\". The main characters, however, do it frequently, since they're aware of the Rules. * The phone lines will always be dead. * No one ever rescues the survivors. Background references A number of background items reference real-life films and other things. They include: * A poster for the 2002 zombie film 28 Days Later.

It is named after Saint Fana, also known as Bane (c. 354‚Äì395), Coptic Christian hermit. The monastery is sometimes called the Monastery of Abu Fanah and is also known as the Monastery of the Cross, due to the presence of many beautifully decorated crosses inside its church. Location The monastery is situated in the Western Desert, not far from the cultivated land of the Nile. The monastery is located in Minya Governorate about 300 km south of Cairo, northwest of Hermopolis around from the village of Qasr Hur and east of the village of Beni Khaled. Foundation and history The monastery was most likely built around the burial site of Saint Fana. His tomb was found during excavations of an international team representing seven European academic institutions and led by Austrian scholar Prof. Dr. Helmut Buschhausen in 1992.Buschhausen, H. et all, Die Ausgrabungen von Abu Fanah in Ober√§gypten im Jahre 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993 The 12th-century historian Abu al-Makarim mentions the church of Saint Fana, which was restored by al-Rashid Abu Fadl.Dr. Otto Meinardus mentions him in \\"Two thousand years of Coptic Christianity,\\" American University in Cairo Press, 1999, p. 215 but does not explain who he is. He was probably a local Egyptian notable. Egyptian historian of the 14th‚Äì15th century al-Maqrizi wrote about the monastery's fine architecture.Otto F.A. Meinardus, \\"Two thousand years of Coptic Christianity\\", American University in Cairo Press, 1999, p. 215 The history of the Patriarchs of Alexandria mentions the monastery of Saint Fana twice, first in relation to the election of Pope Theodosius III of Alexandria of the Coptic Orthodox Church, 1294‚Äì1300 and second to the childhood of Pope Matthew I of Alexandria, 1378‚Äì1408. In pre- Islamic times, the monastery reportedly numbered some 1000 monks. The monastery's numbers had drastically dwindled before the arrival of Islam in the seventh century. Al-Maqrizi reports that during his day, the monastery held only two monks. The French Jesuit priest Father Michel Marie Jullien (1827‚Äì1911) reported that the priest of the neighboring village Qasr Hur had cleared the church of debris and used the church for the Divine Liturgy.Otto F.A. Meinardus, Christian Egypt, Ancient and Modern, American University in Cairo Press, 1977, pp. 365‚Äì366 When German scholar Otto Friedrich August Meinardus visited the monastery in the 1960s, the place was in ruins with remains stretching over a wide area. Only the historical church survived. Pieces of gray granite were also found, suggesting that the monastery may have been built on the location where an ancient temple once stood. On a small hill stand the ruins of a qasr, or tower, which ancient monasteries had. Approximately 80 meters from the ruined monastery one finds the cave of Saint Fana, the location where he reportedly lived. Meinardus does not report on the monastery being inhabited.Otto F.A. Meinardus, Christian Egypt, Ancient and Modern, American University in Cairo Press, 1977, pp. 365‚Äì366 and 'Two thousand years of Coptic Christianity', American University in Cairo Press, 1999, p. 215 The surviving old monastic building consists of an ancient basilica, deeply sunk into the sand in the center of a vast mound that, according to the Coptic Encyclopedia, \\"no doubt\\" conceals the ruins of the Monastery. The neighboring mounds perhaps conceal isolated cells or hermitages.Rene-Georges Coquin and Maurice Martin in the Coptic Encyclopedia, Macmillan Publishing Company, 1991, Vol. 3, p.698-700 Modern history The modern history of the monastery starts with a renewed interest shown by the Coptic Orthodox Church in this monastery after the excavations of the team of Dr. Helmut Buschhausen in 1987‚Äì1993.H. Buschhausen, \\"Die Ausgrabungen in Abu Fano und die Identifizierung des Apa Bane,\\" in Acta XIII Congressus Internationalis Archeologiae Christianae, 1998, p. 159 Following these excavations, the Egyptian Ministry of Culture decided in the year 2002 to declare an area of 1 km by 2 km as the archaeological periphery of the monastery. The Department of Antiquities suspects that this land may hold buried historical remains.Arab-West Report, 2008, week 15, art. 3 Egyptian Villagers Resist Monastery's Growth see map After the Department of Antiquities decision, the Coptic Orthodox Church built new cells, a new entrance, a reception and a large cathedral just outside the boundaries of the archaeological periphery see photo ‚Äì(monastic buildings built from the year 2000 onwards). Prior to 1999, no monks resided permanently in the monastery. Five monks came to the monastery in 1999, and in 2003, Pope Shenouda, head of the Coptic Orthodox Church, consecrated an additional 12 monks, followed later by one more monk. From 2003 onwards there have been repeatedly conflicts over land with neighbors of the monastery. In July 2008 there are a total of 18 monks and 9 novices residing in the monastery, who are assisted by tens of laymen.Muslims, Christians clash over desert, faith, and politics in Upper Egypt, in Christianity Today, 23 July 2008, Figures according to the Deputy Head of the Monastery of Saint Fana, Father Antonius, 27 July 2008 Tensions  On 31 May 2008, monks and Christians close to the Monastery of Saint Fana reported that monks' cells and a church belonging to the monastery had been attacked by a group of roughly sixty armed Arabs,This number is mentioned in the joint press release by Coptic organizations on the monastery of Saint Fana attacks, 7 June 2008 Free Copts. The same number is mentioned by Father Dumadios of the Monastery of Saint Fana, Arab-West Report, 2008, week 15, art. 4. a name commonly used in Egypt for Bedouins who have settled in villages bordering the desertKatia Saqqa, a Syrian writer and translator living in Egypt, writes that the term \\"Arabs\\" is used in Egypt to refer to tribal communities in the desert, Arab-West Report, 2008, week 15, art. 7. The head of the Beni Khaled village, neighbors of the monastery of Saint Fana, explained the importance of reclaiming desert land in Arab-West Report, 2008, week 15, art. 5 The location they show is an outpost of the monastery with monastic cells and a chapel dedicated to Cyril of Alexandriasee photo ‚Äì(extension of the monastery that was attacked). The attacks resulted in damage to this section of the monastery and its surrounding property. The subsequent attack left one Muslim killed, four Christians wounded, and three monks being briefly kidnapped, requiring hospital treatment upon their return.Al-Masry Al-Youm of 1, 2, 3 and 8 July 2008 , al-Usbua of 7 June 2008, al-Dustur of 2 July 2008 (Egyptian newspapers ) The three kidnapped monks were tortured by the Arabs, who also tried unsuccessfully to force them to spit on crosses and to pronounce the Islamic Shahada. In addition, the Arabs burned Bibles and church altars inside the monastery. The clashes were followed one day later by a demonstration of around 300 Coptic youth in Mallawi who blamed the government for \\"inaction in the face of repeated attacks by Muslims against their community.\\"The Peninsula Times, 2 June 2008 published an AFP report mentioning that \\"a security official confirmed that three monks had been kidnapped by Muslims during the clashes and were released on Sunday morning and taken to hospital for treatment.\\" The publication also reported about the demonstration that followed the day following the clashes. 13 Muslims and two Christians who were allegedly involved were arrested and brought before the prosecutor-general.The governor in Arab-West Report, 2008, week 15, art. 3 Governor Ahmed Dia el-Din found a number of police reports documenting disputes over land that span several years.According to the head of the Arab Beni Khaled village, Arab-West Report, 2008, week 15, art. 5 Saint Fana's Monastery had obtained a portion of their land by employing \\"urfi\\" contracts, resulting in the governor's rejection of the monastery's claim to possess valid land titles.Al-Masry Al-Youm, 23 June 2008. Al-Maydan published an article on 18 June 2008 (p. 6) on clashes between Coptic activists and al- Jama'ah al-Islamiyah on the issue of Saint Fana. \\"Urfi\\" contracts, are agreements between two parties that lack the proper registration with the government, contracts that are drafted without first obtaining the required governmental permits. Monks of the monastery criticized local police, stationed approximately from the monastery, for arriving at the monastery several hours after having been informed of the attack.Father Dumadios of the Monastery of Saint Fana, Arab-West Report, 2008, week 15, art. 4. Coptic activists abroad, both during and following the attack, were contacted by monks and laymen in and close to the monastery. Several Coptic websites make it obvious that there was contact between monks and Coptic activists in the West. The Free Copts website wrote on 7 June, \\"According to one of the monks on the scene, the Egyptian police did not respond to the attacks until three hours after the call for help was made.\\" Most references appear to be to Father Mina, see for example Coptic Assembly . They responded by posting angry responses on the Internet and holding several demonstrations in North America and Europe. Many Copts, both those living in the diocese of Mallawi, the diocese the Monastery belongs to, and Coptic activists in the West, alleged that Muslims attempted to force the three kidnapped monks to convert to Islam by declaring the Shahada.Reported on several Coptic websites but also in several Egyptian media such as al-Dust≈´r of 13 June 2008 (p. 1) and al-Fajr, 16 June 2008 (p. 27). Many YouTube productions followed, statements were made, press releases were published, all placing the conflict in a sectarian context, rarely making references to conflicting land claims and if this is done, it is often done to explicitly deny that a land conflict played a role.Reported on several Coptic websites, see for example Copts United , which published the statement of a group of Coptic organizations on 6 June 2008, see also Coptic News The responses from monks, Christian workers in the monastery, and Coptic activists in the West encouraged hundreds of Christians to demonstrate in Mallawi, a Middle Egyptian town which is the seat of the Bishop of Mallawi who is also the abbot of the Monastery of Saint Fana. Demonstrations of Christians in Egypt is a relatively new phenomenon.The subject index of Arab-West Report, covering Muslim-Christian relations in Egypt starting in 1997 until today shows no Christian demonstrations in Egypt between 1997 and 2001, and has recorded several demonstrations since. These were the result of an outburst of Coptic anger against al-NabƒÅ', an Egyptian publication, which in 2001 alleged sexual practices of a monk in the Monastery of Dayr al-Muharraq. The allegations later proved to be false, the newspaper was suspended for some time. search in this subject index for Developments in Muslim-Christian Relations in the Arab world, then search in the subcategory for Christian demonstrations. Al-Ahram provides an overview of a Coptic demonstration , Christian protesters in Mallawi chanted \\"With our blood and soul, we will defend the Cross.\\".Reported on several Coptic websites, The Peninsula Times, 2 June 2008. Nahdat Misr of 3 June 2008 headlined: \\"Copts of Mallawƒ´ demonstrated screaming the Muslims Brother's slogans\\". The author of the article Ayman RiyƒÅd mentioned that the Coptic demonstrators used a slogan that had been used earlier by Muslim Brothers: \\"I will pray, I will pray, no matter what may happen to me.\\" The demonstrators also shouted: \\"Pope Shenouda take care of the issue, we are behind you and we defend you with our blood.\\" It is noteworthy that the same article stated that it was proved that the abduction of the monks was a mere rumor. The attack on the monastery and the ensuing Coptic response in and outside Egypt was prominently reported in Egypt. Heated discussions following the attack were published in the Egyptian media for many weeks following the attack.In the first days following the attack, 1‚Äì8 June, 15 different Egyptian print publications published 43 articles, many of them lengthy. In the weeks that followed, 9 June ‚Äì 6 July, another 54 articles were published. For one month of reviews of Egyptian media following the attack see the English press reviews of Arab-West Report, 2008, week 15, art. 7,8,9 and 10 and Arab-West Report, 2008, week 16, art. 11 Coptic monks and Copts close to the Monastery of Saint Fana placed the attack in a sectarian context which was echoed on several Coptic websites in the West.Father Dumadios of the Monastery of Saint Fana, Arab-West Report, 2008, week 15, art. 4. Coptic leader Pope Shenouda stated that the assailants did not want the monks to cultivate the desert land they legally possess.The governor denied the legality of the ownership documents of the monastery and called them urfi, that is not properly registered with government authorities. Interviews with the governor can be seen in Arab-West Report, 2008, week 15, art. 3 and week 16, art. 4. \\"These (assailants ‚Äì referring to the Muslim Arab neighbors of the Monastery) do not have any one to rule them,\\" Pope Shenouda said in a statement criticizing the Egyptian government for not being able to control the Monastery's Arab neighbors. Pope Shenouda's statement came very close to calling the conflict \\"sectarian\\".Arab-West Report, 2008, week 15, art. 8 The Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church called on the Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak to intervene to prevent a repetition of similar assaults.Al-Dustur, 13 June 2008, mentioned that the Holy Synod‚Äôs declaration is the first of its kind and that it was issued while the pope was on a medical trip to the United States. See also Arab-West Report, 2008, week 15, art. 8 Egyptian media quoted Egyptian officials explicitly denying that this conflict was of a sectarian or religious nature.Arab-West Report, 2008, week 15, art. 7 Egyptian journalist Muhammad al-Baz reports in El Fagr that the attack against the Monastery of Saint Fana was not the first of its kind, and that attacks have been carried out since 2005, but denies that there was a sectarian element to the attacks. Instead, he believes that there were materialistic and financial motives (land ownership) involved. He criticized the monks' allegations that they were targeted because they are Copts. Al Baz claims that the monks pretended that the attacks were of a sectarian nature to obtain people‚Äôs compassion and prove that they are persecuted.El Fagr, 16 June 2008, Arab-West Report, 2008, week 15, art. 8. This argument is supported by Christian activist Raed al-Sharqawi, Arab-West Report, 2008, week 15, art. 2. Amr al-Shubaki stated on 12 June in Al-Masry Al-Youm that the absence of a state of law hurts both Muslims and Christians alike, in the same way that other serious problems such as anarchy and unemployment do. Al-Shubaki referred to the widespread use of urfi agreements and the system of Wad al-Yad ‚Äì a common practice to obtain land. One does not own the land but nevertheless reclaims it and after doing so for several years the land becomes legally owned by the person cultivating the land.Dr. Amr al-Shubaki, 'Sectarianism and counter sectarianism,'in Al-Masry Al-Youm, 12 June 2008, Arab-West Report, 2008, week 15, art. 8. The methods of buying land through urfi agreements and Wad al-Yad are explained in Arab-West Report, 2008, week 15, art. 2. Coptic intellectual Dr. Samir Morkos believes this is a land-conflict with religious dimensions that were introduced to strengthen partisan positions. He worries about the effect that this dispute may potentially have on grassroots Muslim- Christian relations.Dr. Samir Marqus in al-Masry al-Yom, 23 July 2008 Many foreign media have reported the attack; \\"Egyptian Christians, Muslims clash, killing one\\" (Reuters/31 May), \\"One killed, four injured in Egypt monastery clash,\\" (AFP/31 May). The Los Angeles Times placed the attack in the context of other violence directed against Copts on 11 June. The Washington Post on 7 July reported that attacks such as this one make the Christian Copts of Egypt turn inwards, strengthening a ghetto mentality. Christianity Today (23 July) focused on the growing pressure on land and water. Arab-West Report (English ‚Äì Arabic) and the National Council for Human Rights each sent a delegation to the region to investigate the tensions.Al-Wafd newspaper, 18 July 2008, translation is to be found on Arab-West Report Popes from the Monastery of St. Fana #Pope Theodosius III of Alexandria (1294-1300) Abbot the abbot of the monastery was Bishop Ava Demetrius.

Early life Antal was born in Budapest. After earning a degree in law, he decided to pursue art history. He studied with Heinrich W√∂lfflin at the University of Berlin before completing his doctorate under Max Dvor√°k at the University of Vienna. Antal was a member of the Sonntagskreis intellectual group formed in Budapest by B√©la Bal√°zs, Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs and others in 1915.Gluck, Mary. (1985) Georg Luk√°cs and His Generation, 1900-1918. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. p. 14 Career He started his career at the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest with a year as a volunteer from 1914. In 1919, he became its Vorsitzender des Direktoriums (Chairman of the Board) for several months until the White Terror toppled the new Hungarian Soviet Republic and he fled the country. After a brief sojourn in Vienna, Antal lived in Italy until 1923, when he relocated to Berlin. From 1926 to 1934, he was an editor for Kritische Berichte zur kunstgeschichtlichen Literatur, alongside Bruno F√ºrst. In 1933, he was forced to flee from political upheaval again, as the Nazi Party rose to prominence in Germany. Settling in England, he lectured at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London and wrote. According to a 2012 article in Visual Culture in Britain, \\"Antal became the leading practitioner of the social history of art in Britain, and a formative influence on Anthony Blunt and John Pope- Hennessy.\\"Stirton, Paul.

Accessed 5 May 2013. Criticisms of his work include, according to Sorensen, that it assumes \\"too strong a determination of artistic style by social constructs\\" and neglecting the subjectivity of the artist's work in favor of too great an identification with the social class of the artist's sponsor.

He was one of eight children born to John Sands (1708‚Äì1760) and Elizabeth (n√©e Cornwell) Sands (1711‚Äì1782), who also descended from one of the three original families who owned Cow Neck. Sands and his siblings received limited schooling. His older brothers included John Sands (1737-1811), who served as a colonel during the Revolutionary War and was also a member of the New York State Assembly for Queens County, and Joshua Sands, a U.S. Representative. Family The Sands family was one of the original three families that settled in and owned what is now Sands Point, New York. Born in Reading, Berkshire, England, James Sands (d. 1695) immigrated to Plymouth, MA with his wife Sarah and their children, circa 1658. Along with several other men, James Sands obtained what is now Block Island, Rhode Island from the original inhabitants of the island, the Narragansetts, in 1660. In 1661, Sands sailed from Taunton, MA and moved his family to Block Island and had six children.

Sands worked at several positions including at Joseph Decker's store that was located on Peck Slip in lower Manhattan. Around 1769, Comfort opened his own store and by 1776, he had become a wealthy merchant. During the American Revolutionary War, Comfort was a member of the New York Provincial Congress and was appointed as the first New York State Auditor-General (now known as the New York State Comptroller) in 1776. He served in this position until his resignation in 1782. In 1783, Sands and his brother Joshua formed a business partnership dealing in foreign trade and land speculation. Their partnership included real estate ventures and a rope making manufacturing business in Brooklyn. In 1784, the Sands brothers purchased 160 acres of land along the Brooklyn waterfront for $12,000. They acquired the land, originally owned by the Rapelje family (also spelled Rapelye), early Dutch settlers of Brooklyn, under the 1779 New York State \\"Act for the Forfeiture and Sale of the Estates of Persons who Have Adhered to the Enemies of this State.\\" The land acquired in the purchase included what is now the location of the Brooklyn Navy Yard (previously the New York Naval Shipyard), as well as the DUMBO and Vinegar Hill neighborhoods bordering the East River in Brooklyn. The waterfront area was to be the site of a new, planned community, called Olympia. It was to be divided into both commercial and residential properties and would be connected to Manhattan via the nearby ferry service.

Nepal and Pakistan, both Himalayan states, established diplomatic relations on 29 March 1960. These relations were fully established between 1962 and 1963, both nations have since sought to expand trade, strategic and military cooperation. The connections were severed in 1972 followed by Nepal's recognition of Bangladesh, but were later re-established. History Nepal established diplomatic relations with India after the latter's independence in 1947, but did not do so with Pakistan. In 1950, Nepal signed a Treaty of Peace and Friendship with India, creating an extensive relationship of economic, strategic and defence cooperation. Nepal thus remained aloof from Pakistan, which was at conflict with India.Dick Hodder, Sarah J. Lloyd, Keith Stanley McLachlan. Land-locked States of Africa and Asia. page 177. Routledge, 1998. However, Nepal's resentment of Indian influence perceived to be excessive prompted the Nepalese government to develop relations with the People's Republic of China and Pakistan. Diplomatic relations between Nepal and Pakistan were established on 20 March 1960. After the establishment of diplomatic relations, the bonds of friendship and cordiality between these two countries, propelled by understanding and cooperation, have strengthened. The state of bilateral relations at present is based on goodwill, mutual cooperation and friendship. Nepal established a residential Nepalese embassy in Pakistan in 1962 and honorary Nepalese consulate general in Karachi in 1975. Diplomatic relations Nepal and Pakistan signed a protocol for establishing diplomatic relations in 1962. They exchanged ambassadors and set up embassies in 1963, when Ayub Khan, the President of Pakistan made a special visit to Nepal. Both nations also signed agreements to reciprocate the \\"Most Favored Nation\\" status of importance for developing trade and cooperation. In 1963, Pakistan agreed to provide Nepal with free trade access and transport facilities through the port of Chittagong in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and established an air link. This arrangement reduced Nepal's dependence on India for trading privileges. Although Nepal officially maintained neutrality during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, it was one of the first to recognise the independence of Bangladesh. As a retaliation, Islamabad severed ties with Kathmandu two days later. Pakistan support for the democratic process Politically, Nepal and Pakistan have remained good friends over the decades. Pakistan has extended its support for the democratic process in Nepal, after the successful People's Movement-II. Pakistan welcomed the restoration of Nepal's parliament following the popular movement and hoped that the breakthrough would usher in an era of durable peace and prosperity in Nepal. Pakistan has been reiterating its support for Nepal's sovereignty, territorial integrity and peaceful development. SAARC Summit The 19th SAARC summit was a scheduled diplomatic conference, which was originally planned to be held in Islamabad, Pakistan on 15‚Äì16 November 2016. Following the rising diplomatic tensions after the Uri terrorist attack, India announced its boycott of the summit, alleging Pakistan's involvement in the attack. Nepal, the current chair of SAARC, urged that \\"a conducive environment be created soon to ensure the participation of all member states in the 19th SAARC summit in line with the spirit of the SAARC charter\\". Whilst Prime Minister of Nepal Sher Bahadur Deuba underscored his country's commitment to make SAARC a constructive forum for the region and to support Pakistan for the holding of the next SAARC Summit in Islamabad.http://www.app.com.pk/nepal-supports-pakistans-bid-for- saarc-summit-at-islamabad/ Economic relations Nepal and Pakistan signed a trade agreement on 19 October 1962, in order to boost up the bilateral trade. Despite another extensive 1982 trade agreement, the volume of bilateral trade remains comparatively small at US$4.8 million. Pakistan's total exports to Nepal are worth US$1.631 million, while Nepal's exports to Pakistan tally $3.166 million. Both countries have recently stepped up efforts to promote bilateral trade, especially in textiles, oilseeds, extraction of oil and tourism; Pakistan also offered a US$5 million line of credit to Nepal. Nepal and Pakistan are signatories to the South Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) and members of the South Asian Economic Union. FNCCI-FPCCI Joint Business Council The Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry have established FNCCI-FPCCI Joint Business Council. Its meetings provides opportunities for the business communities of the two countries to meet and discuss business opportunities in each other's countries. Education Pakistan, under the Pakistan Technical Assistance Programme (PTAP), provides annually scholarships to Nepal in Medicine, Pharmacy and Engineering. There are 500 Nepali students undertaking higher studies in the field of medical science, engineering, pharmacy, information technology, social science, management, and mass communication in Pakistan. Pakistan provides long and short term training's to the government officials of Nepal.http://mofa.gov.np/nepal-pakistan-relations/ Pakistan Technical Assistance Programme Pakistan has been providing 15 scholarships annually to Nepalese students under Pakistan Technical Assistance Programme in medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and engineering. Besides, some Nepalese students have been studying in the areas of humanities and business administration on self-finance basis. Pakistan has also provided short-term and long-term trainings to Nepal Army officers. Rescue and relief work Nepalese Army, Pakistan Air Force, United States Air Force work together to download relief supplies in Nepal. After the devastating earthquake of April 2015, the Government of Pakistan sent immediate assistance to Nepal. It dispatched rescue and relief teams, food, water, tents and other relief material. Pakistan took part in the International Conference on Nepal's Reconstruction and pledged support to Nepal.https://www.dawn.com/news/1178334 The Government of Pakistan provided US$1 million to the Government of Nepal as the relief to the victims of flood and landslides in Terai region of Nepal in 2017. Security relations In recent years, both countries began developing military cooperation, with Nepal importing arms from Pakistan. Condemned and isolated from India, Great Britain and the United States between 2004 and 2006 for repressing democracy, the Nepalese monarchy developed military cooperation with China and Pakistan, who offered extensive military support, arms and military equipment to Nepal for the monarchy to stay in power and fight the Maoist insurgency. Both Pakistan and China have provided medium-tech weapons to Nepal. Culture Nepal and Pakistan signed the Cultural Agreement in May 1970 which aims at promoting cultural relations, establishing inter- universities relations, and cooperation between Radio and Television. Nepal- Pakistan Friendship and Cultural Association is in operation in Kathmandu. A Nepal Friendship Group also exists in Islamabad. Tourism Nepal and Pakistan signed the Agreement on Tourism Cooperation in February 2009. The Agreement provides for mutual cooperation in tourism and archaeology; exchanges of tourism organizations and travel and tour operators; cooperation to encourage tourists from third countries to visit their respective countries; mutual exchange of tourism information, materials and experience; production of tourism-related films and video-tapes; and joint collaboration for investment. Every year about 5,000 tourist from Pakistan visit Nepal.http://www.tourismdepartment.gov.np/files/download/6e3a3bdd4e069e5  See also  * Nepalis in Pakistan * Pakistanis in Nepal  References  Pakistan Category:Bilateral relations of Pakistan ","title":"Nepal‚ÄìPakistan relations"},{"id":"17725206","text":"A rare heteromorph ammonite fossil from the south of France.

Cybertrance Parties The original mixtapes of Mars vs. Mystre were released in 1997 and 1998, and from around 1996 to 2000, the pair would throw raves in and around San Francisco. The announcements for these and other rave / underground parties were stored on the SF Raves bulletin board / mailing list maintained by Brian Behlendorf. Mainstream success Dedicated to spreading the sound of Cybertrance, Mars opened Frequency 8, America's first record store dedicated to the trance movement. From the success of Frequency 8, Mars would go on to create his own international record label and event organization of the same name. In 2000 Mars and Mystre released their best selling two CD compilation album \\"Faith In 2000\\". The album included fifteen tracks by artists like Art Of Trance, DJ Tandu, and ATB. Mars & Mystre included several tracks that they produced together, such as Electric Blue, Save the Rave, Eye in the Sky, all released on 12 inch vinyl on their record label, Frequency 8. Both also worked with Germany's Nostrum (Bernd Augustinski) on \\"Eye In The Sky\\". Mars also collaborated with Nostrum under the alias Red Rock Project on a track called \\"Mystic Ways \\". Shortly after the release of Faith in 2000 they parted ways and Mars embarked on his solo career. The record store, Frequency 8, located on Haight Street briefly changed to \\"Reverb Records\\" and was run by DJ Mystre (Eric Newman) before finally going out of business. In 2002, before the San Francisco Frequency 8 shut down, Mars opened a frequency 8 location in the Westwood district of Los Angeles near UCLA but the store only stayed in operation for a year or so.

It is followed by The Snake Oil Wars in 1989.  Plot summary  The tale begins with two college-age brothers, Barion and Coyul, members of an advanced alien world. Their race is endowed with the power to manipulate physical matter with their minds, a power which is exploited incessantly by the young adults. An accident strands the brothers on Earth, which at the time has no human race. The brothers hope for rescue, but eventually grow despondent. In their free time, they cause a series of evolutionary changes in the indigenous primates of Earth, which eventually lead to the blossoming of human civilization. The brothers grow fond of their project, which they ardently monitor, intervening when necessary. With all the progress they are able to endow humans with, they are never able to rid them of the dim memory of primal darkness, causing a permanent schism between intellect and emotion, which is termed \\"spiritual schizophrenia\\". Humans have an insatiable need to decipher the meaning of life, a thirst which leads to stubborn belief systems and immense amounts of violence. Eons later, the brothers' creation is in danger due to an unlikely courtship. Charity Stovall is a passionately religious young woman from a small American town. She is poised to marry Roy Stride, a violent young fascist. The young couple is oblivious to the fact that if they were to bear a child, it could possibly be more destructive than Hitler to human culture and possibly humanity itself. Subsequently, the two brothers literally put the duo through hell to keep them apart, subjecting them to outrageous scenarios beyond their control.  Literary devices  Much of the story is expressed through character dialogue, in an outrageous style similar to that of acclaimed British writer Douglas Adams. Godwin also makes frequent allusions to a variety of notable American pop culture icons such as McDonald's, Charlton Heston, and Haight-Ashbury. The writing style incorporates elements of absurdism, especially the futility of attempting to find meaning in the universe.Absurdism  Themes  Waiting for the Galactic Bus is rich in satire. Godwin uses Charity Stovall's character to symbolize the pitfalls of ignorance and ethnocentrism; Charity has good intentions but has the misfortune of believing what she hears. Roy, on the other hand, personifies racism, prejudice, and its often violent ramifications. Godwin uses these character interactions to satirize ignorance, government, and blind adherence to one's beliefs. Organized religion plays a major role in the development of the story; humans invest an abundance of time in attempting to find a supernatural and transcendent meaning to life. In the book (as in the real world), this search is fruitless; even the creators of their world are morally flawed (perhaps more so than the humans themselves) and the main characters' adherence to religion serves only to misguide them and cause strife. In addition, Godwin also satirizes the negative aspects of contemporary American culture, most prominently the perceived obsession with television and materialistic goods. The brothers keep Charity occupied by making her into a star; she finds in her wealth a physical and immediate gratification but also realizes the absence of depth and meaning in her new- found fame. Critical reactions Jo Walton wrote that Waiting for the Galactic Bus \\"is one of the candidates for weirdest book in the world. ... This is not a book that even nods to realism. Indeed, it‚Äôs a book that I doubt realism would recognise if it passed it by in the street. ... But there are other virtues, and it has those‚Äîit‚Äôs charming and funny and genuinely original, it fits together like a sliding block puzzle and it‚Äôs light and dark at the same time. ... If you like books that are beautifully written, and funny, and not like anything else, and if you don‚Äôt mind blasphemy, you might really enjoy this.\\" Review by Jo Walton  See also  *Parke Godwin  Sources  *Waiting for the Galactic Bus by Parke Godwin, Doubleday: 1989. *Review by Charlie Gebetsberger in Rambles *Review by Maria Nutick in Green Man Review  References  Category:1988 American novels Category:Doubleday (publisher) books Category:American science fiction novels Category:Works by Parke Godwin ","title":"Waiting for the Galactic Bus"},{"id":"17725268","text":"Internet subculture may refer to: * a subculture disseminated mainly over the Internet, or * Cyberculture, the (sub)culture emerging from the Internet.

Its fossils have been found in the Burgess Shale of Canada and the Jince Formation of the Czech Republic. Fossils are both rare and poorly known; the genus was described by Walcott in 1918 and has not been reexamined, though it was briefly reviewed in the 1990s and has been included in a number of cladistic analyses. It has been lumped with the arachnomorphs. One analysis has resolved the Helmetiiida as a robust clade and the closest relatives of trilobites. The most complete specimen of Helmetia is 19 cm long, and has six thoracic segments. There is a head shield and a large tail shield, making the animal leaf-shaped. Unlike trilobites, the margin of the head shield is concave, ending in a spine on each corner. There is an oval structure with two spots at the anterior center of the head shield, behind which are two eyes. The whole animal is broad and flat with a thin exoskeleton. The central region shows paired muscle scars and filamentous structures interpreted as limbs. Because the head shield, thoracic segments, and tail shield are all angular in outline and end in spines, Helmetia is unstreamlined and would likely be a slow swimmer. However, the flattened body and filamentous limbs suggest a floating or swimming lifestyle. It has been interpreted as a nektonic suspension feeder.CARON, J.-B. and JACKSON, D. A. 2008.

Two Toed Sloth at Henson Robinson Zoo History The Springfield Park District's Henson Robinson Zoo began as an advocacy act by contractor Henson C. Robinson of Springfield. The city of Springfield was slothful at first in implementing this proposal; but in 1967, the mayor and city council set aside and donated a tract of land to the Springfield Park District. Construction of the zoo began in 1968 and on August 29, 1970, the Henson Robinson Zoo was officially opened on land owned by the Park District. Over the years, the zoo has grown and expanded with the addition of several new animals as well as exhibits. The zoo is now home to animal native to Australia, Africa, Asia and North and South America. Over 80 species of native and exotic animals are housed amongst their naturalistic exhibits. Red Wolf at Henson Robinson Zoo Current status As of 2019, curator Jeff Mitchell and his staff are rewriting the zoo's master plan. The new plan will maintain the zoo's membership in and compliance with the American Species Survival Plan, the endangered-species-oriented operating plan that governs most U.S. professional zoos. The Survival Plan urges zoos to concentrate on the creation and maintenance of socially healthy groups of geographically separated animals so that they can breed and perpetuate their genetic heritage without inbreeding. Red Tailed Hawk at Henson Robinson Zoo Education The Zoo's 501-c-3 arm, the Springfield Zoological Society, concentrates on juvenile outreach, with a particular emphasis on social media and school-group activities and visits. The Zoo conducts frequent consultations with Springfield's School District #186 in the teaching of conservation and biology through hands-on animal experiences.

It is native to the southeastern and south-central United States from Oklahoma to Maryland. Description Trillium pusillum is a perennial herbaceous plant with a thin, branching, horizontal rhizome. It produces one or two slender scapes up to tall. They increase in size after flowering. The three bracts are dark green, sometimes with a red tinge when new. The flower has three green to red-tinged sepals up to long and three wavy-edged petals that open white but quickly age pink. The six stamens are tipped with lavender or yellow anthers each up to a centimeter long. The stigmas have long, narrow, spreading lobes. The pulpy fruit is long. Ecology Trillium pusillum flowers from March to early May. It can be found in several habitat types, including savannas, swamps, bogs, forests and woods, and fields. It grows on acidic soils. In Missouri, it is commonly pollinated by the western honey bee (Apis mellifera), and the seeds are dispersed by ants and harvestmen. Taxonomy In addition to Trillium pusillum Michx., the following names are widely accepted: * Trillium pusillum var. pusillum * Trillium pusillum var. virginianum Fernald The flowers of var. virginianum are usually slightly smaller than those of var. pusillum. Also, the flower of var. pusillum sits on a pedicel in length whereas the flower of var. virginianum is sessile or subsessile. If a pedicel is present in the latter variety, it is less than in length. Many other names are in use, including: * Trillium pusillum var. ozarkanum (E.J.Palmer & Steyerm.) Steyerm. * Trillium pusillum var. texanum (Buckley) Reveal & C.R.Broome The name Trillium texanum Buckley, used interchangeably with Trillium pusillum var. texanum, is regarded by some as a synonym for Trillium pusillum var. pusillum.

The Canadiana was also noted for being the last passenger vessel to be built in Buffalo, New York. After being sold in 1956 the Canadiana changed owners numerous times and by 1983 she was berthed in Ohio needing major restoration. A nonprofit group, the \\"Friends of the Canadiana\\", brought the ship back to Buffalo in 1984 with a hope of restoring her to service. When restoration efforts failed the ship was scrapped at Port Colborne, Ontario in 2004. Construction The Canadiana was built at the Buffalo Dry Dock on Ganson Street in 1910 and was the last passenger vessel to be built in Buffalo. She was designed by marine architect Frank E. Kirby who would go on later to design the largest side wheel overnight steamers built for the Great Lakes, the Greater Buffalo and the Greater Detroit. The completed ship was long and a beam amidships. She was powered by one triple- expansion steam engine that produced 1,446 horsepower and a single propeller provided propulsion. The Canadiana also had a cutout in the main deck to allow passengers to view the \\"workings\\" of the engine. The Canadiana was fitted with brass railings, red mahogany trim from Honduras and beveled mirrors. She was designed to be a premier vessel designed not only for transportation but also for pleasure. Originally intended to carry 3500 passengers, it was decided by the United States Coast Guard that 1800 was a safer number. With the reduction in passenger capacity, the ship's owners found room to construct the largest dance floor of any steamer ever placed on the Great Lakes. History The Crystal Beach Amusement Park, Ontario, Canada (just west of Fort Erie) as it appeared in the early 1960s. After her completion, the Canadiana joined her sister ship, the Americana, which had been built in 1908. Both ships would make round trip passages between Buffalo and Crystal Beach until the Americana was sold in 1929. Although the Canadiana was popularly known as \\"The Crystal Beach Boat\\", she would occasionally make journeys to other destinations including Port Colborne, Ontario. Nevertheless, Crystal Beach remained its primary destination. Her crossings to and fro from Crystal Beach and Buffalo were often highlighted by big band concerts aboard on which some of the region's most famous musical acts performed, including acts who regularly performed within the park's large Ballroom Building. After the completion of the Peace Bridge in 1927, which allowed automobile traffic between Buffalo and Crystal Beach, some of the popularity of the Canadiana was lost. Ticket prices were kept low in order to attract the necessary patrons to make the ship profitable. During World War II, the Canadiana saw an increase in business. This was due, in part, to gas rationing because of the war. A British pilot, who was flying with the Canadian Air Force, was killed when he lost control of his aircraft while \\"buzzing\\" the Canadiana during World War II as well. In its last year of service an \\"incident\\" happened on board the Canadiana. While returning from Crystal Beach to Buffalo on the evening of May 30, 1956, violence erupted between several youths. The group of belligerents, made up of whites and African-Americans, left little doubt that racism was a factor in the incident. This incident, along with shrinking revenues, made continued operation of the ship uneconomical. The 1956 season proved to be the last for the Canadiana and she was sold. After being sold, the Canadiana was involved in an accident on July 30, 1958. While on her normal excursion trip traveling upstream on the Maumee River from her berth in Toledo to Bob-Lo Island, the Canadiana was struck by a railroad swing bridge and damaged. The Canadiana was sold in 1960 and was towed to Cleveland, Ohio being unofficially renamed Pleasurama. From 1960 through 1967 the Canadiana was stored at Buffalo, Fairport and Cleveland. She sank at her berth in Cleveland on February 17, 1982 and wasn't refloated until May 1983. Following her refloat, she was moved to Ashtabula, Ohio. A second Americana, formally a 1940s-built ferry-cruise boat for the Circle Line, was placed in service to Crystal Beach during the 1988-89 seasons, with mixed profits. After the park's closure, the ship was used for lake cruises before her owners, among them proprietor Ramsey Tick, filed for bankruptcy in 1990. The small ship was later sold off to Caribbean interests. Restoration efforts Friends of the Canadiana A non-profit group called the \\"Friends of the Canadiana\\" was formed in 1983 to try to save the ship and restore her to service. A fund raising effort was undertaken and she was purchased by the group. The Canadiana was towed back to Buffalo during September 1984. In July 1988, after being stripped down for restoration to return her to sailing conditions under modern regulations, the Canadiana was towed to the Marsh Engineering Dock at Port Colborne, Ontario for drydocking. The S.S. Canadiana Preservation Society, Inc. During 1993 changes were implemented regarding the restoration efforts. On July 1, 1993, the name of the organization was changed to The S.S. Canadiana Preservation Society, Inc. Along with the name change, membership of the corporation board of directors was undertaken and efforts were made for the corporation to be designated as an \\"Education Corporation\\". These changes were undertaken by the organization with the eventual goal of being accredited as a full-fledged museum. During the 1990s, a number of studies regarding the ship and its use were undertaken. The S.S. Canadiana Preservation Society applied for, and was awarded on December 8, 1994, a $400,000 grant under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Enhancement Act for the restoration efforts. Following the award, in 1995, the award funding was withdrawn by the New York State Department of transportation and a lawsuit was filed by The S.S. Canadiana Preservation Society. The final outcome of the court case was that the withdrawal of funding by the New York State Department of Transportation was upheld. Scrapping When restoration plans were not realized the remaining hull of the Canadiana was cut up for scrap in 2004 at Port Colbourne, Ontario. The ship's engine was salvaged and returned to Buffalo to be part of a planned exhibit. Much of the wooden superstructure was saved including the pilot house. Some of the salvaged wood has been manufactured into various memorabilia. See also *Frank E. Kirby *USS Sable (IX-81) *MV Aquarama *Buffalo, New York *Crystal Beach, Ontario *Edward M.

It was released in North America on January 3, 2001. Gameplay The game is played in a manner similar to a shoot 'em up arcade game. Players control the S-11 fighter, which can freely move across the top- down oriented screen. Waves of enemies come from the top of screen (and occasionally the side) which the player must attempt to destroy to gain points. Players can collect various power-ups, which will make their weapons stronger or give them an extra life. Players will fight a mini boss half-way through a level, and a larger boss at the end of each level.

McKissack and published by Scholastic in 1997 as part of their Dear America series. Plot summary The book is written in the form of a diary kept by Clotee, a young slave girl on a Virginia plantation in 1859. Clotee secretly teaches herself to read and write while fanning William, her owner's young son, during his lessons with his mother Miz Lilly. Clotee is discovered by Mr Harms, the tutor, who is actually an abolitionist working to help slaves escape via the Underground Railroad. When Clotee is given the opportunity to escape, she must decide whether to run away to freedom or stay behind to help other slaves escape. Clotee's best friend on the plantation is a very strong girl named Spicy. Spicy desperately wants to change her name to Rose (the name her mother picked out for her), but is forced to accept the name given by her owners. Clotee later writes in Spicy's Bible, the only keepsake that Spicy has from her mother, that Spicy's name is actually Rose. Spicy is also in love with Hince, the person who Clotee calls her \\"brother-friend\\". Clotee and Spicy are the property of \\"Mas' Henley,\\" a cruel man. While Master Henley never whips or beats Clotee in the book, he does strike Spicy across the face in the final chapter. Mistress Lilly Henley is a weak, foolish woman and a disinterested mother. Clotee's mother was Lilly Henley's personal maid, but Master Henley forced his wife to sell her maid; Clotee's mother later died far from her daughter. Clotee's father is not present in the story as he drowned in the river before she was born. Mistress Lilly often tries to make Clotee her little pet, claiming that Clotee's mother was a very good friend of hers. Clotee always finds a way to decline and Lilly soon gives up, taking another housemaid under her wing and trying to turn the household servants against each other. When Ely Harms is driven off the Henley Plantation, Clotee takes his place as a conductor on the Underground Railroad. Clotee comes up with a plan so that Mr Harms didn't get arrested. Clotee eventually runs away; we later learn that she has become a teacher. She also keeps up correspondence with William Henley, who becomes an abolitionist as well. Clotee dies at the age of 92, and the book ends with the quote from her gravestone: \\"Freedom is more than a word\\". Adaptations In 1997, the book was adapted for television by HBO for their Dear America miniseries. The episode starred Shadia Simmons as Clotee.

The genus was described by Conway Morris (1979) and re-examined by Eibye- Jacobsen (2004).  Physical characteristics  Burgessochaeta had two long tentacles on its head. The rest of the body had between 16 and 30 segments (possibly indicating multiple species). Each segment had two groups of long chaetae on it, which Burgessochaeta presumably used to swim. Burgessochaeta is not thought to have had eyes. The body grew slightly wider towards the posterior end of the animal.  Ecology  Burgessochaeta is thought to have been a decomposer or scavenger on organic material. It probably swam, as its bristles were much too long to be useful for moving itself in a burrow. Specimens have been found from both continental slope and deep-water environments, indicating that this was a widespread animal.

Plot summary World War I still rages on in Europe, and Tom Swift is still inventing wartime technology, but inspiration comes in the form of infatuation: while taking Mary Nestor for a brief flight, he is unable to communicate due to the noise of the engine, which sets Tom onto the track of developing a totally silent airship. While Mary Nestor was the spark, Tom intends to offer this to the United States government for use on the western front. While this is still a germ of an idea, Tom is approached by Mr. Gale and Mr. Ware, representatives of the Universal Flying Machine Company, a competing airship manufacturer. Tom is offered a lucrative salary to join the firm, but Tom is uninterested in the money. Tom's refusal infuriates the men, and events are set in motion, which include the (accidental) kidnapping of Mr. Nestor, Mary's father. Inventions & Innovation Tom builds a special silencer for airship engines. The silencer consists of several components: a new type of propeller, retooling the engine compression, but most importantly, a new type of muffler. The muffler system is simply described as a series of baffles. The end result is an airship which produces no discernible noise, to be used on scouting missions in the war. * Tom Swift and His Air Scout e-text at Project Gutenberg Category:1919 American novels Category:Tom Swift Category:American young adult novels Category:Novels set during World War I Category:Aviation novels ","title":"Tom Swift and His Air Scout"},{"id":"17725636","text":"The London Rock and Roll Show is a 1973 British-produced concert film directed by Peter Clifton chronicling a Rock and Roll Revival concert held at Wembley Stadium in London, England in August 1972. Background From the late 1960s to the early 1970s, many rock and roll performers from the 1950s experienced major career revivals due to a temporary upswing of interest in their form of music. The Revival was marked by a series of major concerts in the United States, and also spread to Europe where events such as the Wembley concert attracted thousands of fans who came out to see the performers behind the music. London Rock and Roll Show begins with excerpts from numerous \\"warm-up\\" performers shown singing either covers of 1950s hits, or original tunes, including a performance by Screaming Lord Sutch that threatens to end the concert prematurely when he brings a stripper on stage. The main concert segment begins with Bo Diddley and continues with a string of other major performers including Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, and Bill Haley and His Comets. The concert ends with an extended performance by Chuck Berry, who at the time was enjoying major chart success in Britain and the US with his \\"My Ding-a-Ling\\" (although he does not perform that song in this film). Mick Jagger also appears in several non-musical interludes in which he is interviewed about the performers. In 1975, the film was released in the U.S. by Richard Ellman Film Enterprises in Association with Aion Films in quadraphonic sound. Although no soundtrack release occurred at the time the film was made, one was finally issued in the early 2000s, followed by several different DVD releases with different combinations of performances.

Climate The climate of the ecoregion is mostly of K√∂ppen's humid subtropical (Cfa) to humid warm summer continental (Dfb) type, with wet winters. Some areas of relatively high rainfall have been considered a temperate rainforest relict. Flora Several species of deciduous oaks (most prominently Quercus frainetto Ten., as well as Q. cerris L., Q. pubescens Willd. and others) dominate most of the ecoregion's forests, interspersed higher up mountainsides (above 800‚Äì1200 m) mostly with European beech and such conifers as Scots pine, Bosnian pine, Macedonian pine, silver fir and Norway spruce. The highest peaks support alpine tundra vegetation.

A feature of the Israeli-Syrian General Armistice Agreement (GAA) was the provision for the establishment of a special demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the countries. The DMZ established by the GAA between Israel and Syria was \\"defined with a view toward separating the armed forces of the two parties in such manner as to minimize the possibility of friction and incident, while providing for the gradual restoration of normal civilian life in the area of the DMZ, without prejudice to the ultimate settlement\\".article. V, para. 2, of the General Armistice Agreement This provision had to be made because of the divergent viewpoints of the two parties during the armistice negotiations as to the sovereignty of the areas within the boundaries of the former Mandatory Palestine, which had been occupied by Syrian troops. A compromise agreement was finally reached under which the disputed areas were to be completely demilitarized. The armistice demarcation lines between Syria and Israel outside of the DMZ coincided with the international boundary.

Background Map of the Golan Heights with demilitarized zone and demarcation line between Israel and Syria With the instigation of the final truce to the 1948 Israeli war of Independence the only areas of the northern sector of former British Mandate of Palestine not occupied by Israel were those areas along the Jordan River controlled by Syria. Israel insisted on retaining all the territory it had occupied that had been designated for an Arab state. However, it demanded that Syria not be allowed to remain in the areas that Syria had occupied. UN acting mediator Ralph Bunche was able to convince Syria to withdraw on the understanding that the sovereignty of the 3 Israel-Syria DMZs created (totalling ) would remain undetermined until a final peace settlement was achieved. Practically, all the work carried out by the ISMAC was cantered upon the problems arising in the DMZ. The pattern of disputes concerning the DMZ generally followed three lines: :(a) disputes about establishing of new and rebuilding of old settlements in the area; :(b) disputes about the number of civilians to be readmitted into the area; and :(c) disputes about the removal of military installations in the area. On the first point: In 1950, a new kibbutz at Beit Katzir was established in the southern DMZ. Like most of their kibbutzim in troubled areas, it was fortified with trenches with a double-apron of barbed-wire fence from behind which its settlers sallied out to cultivate the surrounding land, digging irrigation canals to channel the water from the Sea of Galilee with such vigour that before long no Arab farmer in the area was allowed into the stretch of land between the kibbutz and the lake. The MAC decided that the new settlement at Beit Katzir erected by returning Israelis had been established without the agreement of the Chairman of the MAC, it was fenced in, so as to be more the nature of a military outpost and that the fence should therefore be removed. Israel complied with that decision.A Report Dated 12 February 1950 From The Chief Of Staff Of The Truce Supervision Organization In Palestine To The Secretary-General On The Activities Of The Mixed Armistice Commissions The second point \\"the return of civilians\\" to the DMZ gave rise to a good deal of disputes. The chairman of the MAC could interpret his duties and powers under the GAA only in such a way so as to permit the return of Syrian and Israeli civilians in numbers corresponding to the number of Syrian and Israeli civilians prior to the end of the British Mandate.article. V para. 2, of the General Armistice Agreement According to this principle, the MAC Chairman authorized Syrian and Israeli civilians to return to the DMZ to resume their civilian life there as of 8 September. By the end of January 1950, the number of Israelis returned to the area under this ruling, roughly equalled the number of Israelis who had resided there at the end of the mandatory regime. The number of Syrians returned by the end of January 1950 amounted to approximately 75% of those living there at the expiration of the Mandate. At first, Syrian representatives opposed the ruling of the chairman and requested that the number of returning civilians be limited. At a later stage, however, the Syrian representatives accepted the Chairman of the MAC‚Äôs ruling as to the number of returning refugees, but the Syrian delegation were still opposed to the MAC Chairman's ruling that new settlements may be erected by returning settlers, both Arab and Israeli. This Syrian attitude appeared to the Chairman of the MAC to be partly motivated by the disparity of economic conditions under which the returning Arab and Israeli civilians live. The returning Israeli settlers were well equipped with building materials, machinery, and agricultural implements and were therefore, in a position to speedily establish permanent settlements that Syria considered of potential military value. On the other hand, returning Arab refugees often arrived completely destitute in their former villages, most of which have been leveled by Israeli forces prior to their withdrawal from the area after the signing of the Israeli-Syrian Armistice Agreement. The Chairman of the ISMAC felt there was no doubt that the dispute could have been easily resolved if the economic conditions of civilians returning from both sides could have been somewhat equalized by providing the returning Arab refugees with building materials and with agricultural implements. However, the Chairman of the ISMAC and the Chief of Staff UNTSO had no means at their disposal to assist the rehabilitation of Arab refugees returning to their homes nor were they in a position officially to enlist the co-operation of any of the other United Nations agencies in the area that might conceivably be concerned with this problem. However, the representative in Beirut of the United Nations Relief for Palestine Refugees (fore runner of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees established on 8 December 1949)UN Doc A/RES/302 (IV) General Assembly Resolution 302 of 8 December 1949 Establishing UNRWA, Advisory Commission/UNCCP consultations and Economic Survey Mission and the International Red Cross did provide limited aid to the returning Arab refugees. As to the third point, the ISMAC, with the co-operation of both parties, had by 12 February 1950 completed the removal of military installations, mines and fortifications from the demilitarized zones as specified in the GAA. Failure of the Mixed Armistice Commission to hold regular meetings As part of its dispute with Syria over use of the Demilitarized Zone created by the Israel-Syria Armistice Agreement, Israel from 1951 refused to attend meetings of the Israel‚ÄìSyria Mixed Armistice Commission. The U.N. Security Council, in its resolution of 18 May 1951, noted that refusal to participate in Mixed Armistice Commission meetings was \\"inconsistent with the objectives and intent of the Armistice Agreement\\".UN Doc S/RES/93 (1951) S/2157 of 18 May 1951 Mideast situation/Return to permanent peace in Palestine - Israel, Syria to observe Armistice Agreement On 20 June 1951 Israel informed the UNTSO that it would no longer attend meetings of the Syrian/Israeli MAC as long as complaints involving the DMZs were on the agenda. Israel argued that Israel alone had sovereignty over the DMZs and that Syria had no rights and therefore, no standing to discuss the zones. Israel immobilized the MAC working within the DMZ. Israel also refused to allow UN observers to carry out a cadastral demarcation of the line of the DMZs and thereby no one was ever sure exactly where the line lay. The Israel position concerning the competence of the MAC to deal with questions connected with the DMZ was a direct contradiction of the Syrian position on the same subject. The Israel position was set out in the following extracts from the memorandum from the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 27 December 1954: \\"‚Ä¶The absence of any Syrian locus standi in the zone is demonstrated conclusively in the limitation of the competence of the Mixed Armistice Commission with regard to matters of the DMZ. According to paragraph 5 (c) of article V, it is the Chairman of the Commission (or the Chief of Staff), and not the Commission, of which Syria is a member, that is responsible for ensuring the implementation of article V, governing the DMZ. \\"‚Ä¶ \\"It is evident ... that no distinction can be deduced between the Chairman's jurisdiction over civilian matters and his competence with regard to the military aspects of article V. Indeed, paragraph 5 (c) of that article defines the Chairman's responsibility as ensuring the full implementation of the article without any difference whatever between its civilian life clauses and its military provisions.Report dated 6 January 1955 by the Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization in Palestine to the Secretary-General on complaints concerning the observance of the General Armistice Agreement between Israel and Syria The principle of the personal responsibility of the ISMAC Chairman was followed in practice by the Israeli delegation throughout the years of the ISMAC existence, except when otherwise agreed to by Israel (as for instance in a number of MAC discussions held before 1951). The chairmen of the ISMAC had taken up and settled numerous questions concerning the DMZ directly with the Israeli representatives. From July 1954 to January 1955 at least, 15 such matters, regarding civilian as well as military questions of the zone, had been brought by the MAC Chairman before the Israel authorities. Syria, however, persisted in Israel‚Äôs opinion, to attempt to create for itself a position that would entitle it to intervene in a territory that lay outside its State boundaries, and in several instances questions concerning the DMZ had appeared at Syria‚Äôs insistence on the agenda of the MAC. It was evident that Israel could not acquiesce in attempts by Syria to gain rights Israel felt it was not entitled to, and remained consistent in upholding what they felt was the basic tenet of the GAA: exclusion of Syria from any rights within the DMZ, even if this sometimes meant the Israeli delegation absenting itself from MAC meetings when Syria sought to intervene in questions affecting the zone.Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 27 December 1954 annex B, para. 3 and paras. 7 to 9 The Syrian position on this matter was contained in the first part of the aide-memoire of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This aide-memoire also refers to the note verbale of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Chief of Staff dated 17 June 1954 [S/3230]. The Syrian position may be summarized as follows: the MAC being competent to supervise the execution of the provisions of the GAA, including article V, relating to the DMZ, was empowered to deal with complaints submitted by the parties relating to the implementation of article V. Paragraph 5 (c) of article V of the armistice agreement refers to the responsibility of the Chairman of the MAC and UN observers for ensuring the full implementation of the article, whereas the first paragraph of article VII provides that the MAC shall supervise the execution of the provisions of the agreement. Such conflicting views as to the competence of the MAC in relation to the DMZ resulted in the failure of the MAC to hold regular meetings since 20 June 1951, the Syrian delegation refusing to withdraw complaints relating to the DMZ from the list of complaints pending before the MAC, while the Israel delegation insists that such complaints be deleted. \\"There are differences of opinion between the parties to the Armistice Agreement on the meaning of various provisions of article V, including those which relate to the Chairman's powers, but neither party requested an interpretation by the MAC in the manner established by Article VII of the agreement, and the Chairman has had to rely on his own interpretation, knowing that in many cases it would probably be found unacceptable by one party or by both and that the requests of the Chairman of the ISMAC were likely to be met with refusal on the ground that the Chairman of the ISMAC was exceeding his powers or acting in some other manner contrary to the provisions of the Armistice Agreement.\\"UN Doc S/2389, para. 4 DMZ and border incidents May 1951, Syrian military forces crossed into Israel at a point where the Jordan River meets the Sea of Galilee and occupied a hill. They were ejected by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) after heavy fighting.Zeev Schiff, History of the Israeli Army (1870-1974) (Straight Arrtow Books, San Francisco, 1974), p.57 31 December 1952, Following incidents in the area of Tel Katzir, the Israel General Staff officer in charge of the Israeli delegation to the MAC stated that the terrain features prevailing in the area south-west of Sea of Galilee imposed certain security considerations, and that Israel considered that area as a security zone. The area east and south of Tel Katzir was a vital part of that security zone, and Israel could not accept the claim of free access of Arab farmers from Tawafiq to some fields within the area. The Chairman of the MAC did not recognize the Israeli claim that this area is vital to Israel's security. The fighting in the spring of 1953 resulted in Syria managing to gain control of the village of al-Hamma in the southern zone, all of the tiny northern zone and the uninhabited narrow stretch of land on the east side of the Jordan River in the central zone. Israel laid claim to the remainder, most of the southern zone and the entire central zone west of the Jordan River. September 1953 Israel advanced plans to divert water to help irrigate the coastal Sharon Plain and eventually the Negev desert and launched a diversion project on a channel midway between the Huleh Marshes and the Sea of Galilee in the central DMZ to be rapidly constructed. Syria claimed that it would dry up of Syrian land. The UNTSO Chief of Staff Major General Vagn Bennike of Denmark noted that the project was denying water to two Palestinian water mills, was drying up Palestinian farm land, and was a substantial military benefit to Israel against Syria. The Israeli response was to increase work. UN Security Council Resolution 100\\"UN Doc S 3182 UN Security Council Resolution 100 of 27th October 1953\\" \\"deemed it desirable\\" for Israel to suspend work started on 2 September \\"pending urgent examination of the question by the Council\\". Israel finally backed off by moving the intake out of the DMZ and for the next three years the US kept its economic sanctions by threatening to end aid channelled to Israel by the Foreign Operations Administration and insisting on tying the aid with Israel's behaviour. The Security Council ultimately rejected Syrian claims that the work was a violation of the Armistice Agreements and drainage works were resumed and the work was completed in 1957.UN Doc S/4271 Letter dated 25 February 1960 from the representative of Israel to the President of the Security Council 25 February 1960 Syria claimed that on 30 June 1954, an Israel armoured vehicle attacked the Syrian post of El Koursi, situated on Syrian soil, with its 20mm gun.Report dated 6 January 1955 by the Chief of Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization in Palestine to the Secretary-General on complaints concerning the observance of the GAA between Israel and Syria A similar Syrian claim was repeated for the following day. The Syrians alleged that on 1 July 1954 two Israeli armoured vehicles attacked the Syrian post of El Koursi with their 20mm and 57mm guns and further alleged that artillery fire continued for approximately one hour and forty-five minutes, causing material damage to the post. Israeli kibbutzniks from Tel Katzir had been conducting illegal work using tractors on lands belonging to the civilian Arab population of the southern DMZ (Tawafiq) when on 5 December 1954 in the southern DMZ, the Syrians alleged that a group of 8 armed regular Israel police had fired on two civilians from Tawafiq.Report dated 6 January 1955 by the Chief of Staff of the UNTSO in Palestine to the Secretary-General on complaints concerning the observance of the GAA between Israel and Syria 8 December 1954 A party of 5 Israeli soldiers were captured several kilometres inside Syrian territory. The soldiers were subjected to excruciating torture by the Syrians.Ephraim Kahana, Historical dictionary of Israeli intelligence, (Scarecrow 2006) pp.118-119 After interrogation they admitted to carrying out a mission to retrieve a phone tapping device. 12 December 1954 Israeli Air Force Meteors forced a Syrian DC-3 Dakota to land at Lod airport after the plane intruded into Israeli airspace.Aircraft downed during the Cold War and thereafter, 11/08/2005\\"Syrian Plane, All Passengers, Released by Israel; Leaves for Cairo.\\" Jewish Telegraphic Agency 15 Dec 1954 The plane strayed near the vicinity of the Israeli city Acre. The passengers and crew were released shortly thereafter after completion of UN and Israeli inquiries. Author Avi Shlaim claims that the plane was forced down as a pretext to facilitate a prisoner exchange and he referred to the incident as \\"unprecedented.\\" He also notes that Moshe Sharett acknowledged this in speech.Avi Shlaim. (2000) The Iron Wall;Israel and the Arab World Penguin Books p 116 11 December 1955, under the command of Ariel Sharon, Israel sent two paratroop battalions backed by artillery and mortar batteries and attacked Syrian gun emplacements at Buteiha Farm and the village of Kursi (El Koursi) outside the DMZ, on the northeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. 50 Syrians were killed and 30 Syrian soldiers taken prisoner. 6 Israeli troops were killed.Avi Shlaim (2000) p.150 Avi Shlaim contends that Israel was testing out the extent of co-ordination between Egypt and Syria vis a vis the Mutual Defence pact signed between Egypt and Syria in October 1955. Avi quotes Bar-On in \\"Challenge and Quarrel\\" p.56-58. \\"If Nasser failed to rise to the challenge, the hollowness of his pledge would be exposed before the entire Arab world; if he did rise to it, this local incident might develop into a general confrontation with Egypt.\\" The raid was prompted by repeated Syrian attacks on Israeli fishing in the Sea of Galilee.Encyclopedia Judaica, Vol 9 Macmillan 1971, p386 30 October 1956, when Israel attacked Egypt across the Sinai peninsula in co-ordination with an Anglo-French attack on Suez, the remainder of the Palestinians living in the DMZs were driven into Syria.

The player is given a choice of characters of different classes, their appearance customisable. The player can customize various attributes of their character as they progress throughout the game. Gameplay Beginning at level one, the player must work their way up through the government positions of the individual classes to gain skills and unlock new quests. Each class has its own strengths and weaknesses. In order to level up players must kill monsters to gain experience points. Experience points the player gains from killing monsters varies, depending on factors such as player level, monster level, experience events/scrolls etc. With the latest job changes added, there are 6 jobs per class. Classes The player is able to choose between four character classes. Currently, only five classes are unlocked for playing. These are Knight, Archer, Magician, Thief, Shaman and Sword Trickster (only available in G2 (New) server). In all classes the players gets to choose a certain job direction. Mainly, this choice will be to pick either an attack class, or a support class. Combat A Thief defending herself against monsters Players may use their character to fight monsters and opponents in the same ways; they can use their normal attacks which do not consume magic points, and also can use their special attacks which consume magic points. Monsters give experience and items, which can vary between different monsters. Player versus Player Currently there are six events in which players can fight one another. Every PvP mode, except for the 'duel' and 'assassin' mode, gives \\"Honor points\\", which the player can use to upgrade their skills, buy new weapons and accessories. =Castle Siege= Castle siege is a mode in the game where one alliance defends the Geum-Oh Castle, whilst three alliances can sign up to attack. The attacking alliances must remove the flag in the middle of the castle, held by the defending alliance. After a flag is hoisted, it must be defended in order to gain the \\"spawn point\\" inside the castle. =Destructing Key Points= The goal of this mode is for two teams to destroy towers. After three small towers are taken down, the giant tower can be destroyed. The team who has killed the most opposing players and destroyed the most towers wins. =Protecting Leader= Two guilds fight each other; one is left with the task of defending their own guild leader while he prays. There are a total of three rounds. If a leader is killed, or the round ends, the roles are then reversed and the defenders become the attackers. =Suffering Valley= Two guilds must fight monsters to gain points, higher level monsters are worth more points. Killing opposing players also rewards the winning player's team more points. The team with the most points after 1 hour is declared the winner. =Battlefield Island= Players have to keep as many pillars up as possible. Monsters appear from nests and attack the pillars. There is also an enemy team which can also attack the pillars. Each team has two points, and the middle is neutral ground. If an enemy sets up a pillar, the team who controls the center will lose stats. The team with the most points/bases wins. Guilds Groups of players called \\"Guilds\\" can be formed in the game and require six players to create. Each guild has a leader and a co-leader - the leader is the founder of the guild, and he can add, remove and rank players in the guild. Each guild has its own name (changeable through using scrolls which are bought through the game's website, using a currency called KalCash). Each guild rank has a customisable title, though the original ranks (in order of highest-to-lowest) are: Leader, SubLeader, Chief, Member, Temporary member. Servers The game currently has two international servers: G1 and G2 (New) Server one (Hanin), has existed since KalOnline opened in 2004 and currently has the most players. Naraeha was then released two years later. Bango, the third and newest server, had the fewest players, but now its closed. Initially the game was only available in Korea, but due to large popularity in Korea, an international server was later added.

It was written by Terry Nation, from a story by Jeremy Lloyd and Trevor Peacock. Pop singer Adam Faith stars as a writer who travels with some friends to Scotland to fake a sighting of the Loch Ness Monster. The cast includes a number of leading British film actors, including Wilfrid Brambell as a local postman, Sid James, Charles Hawtrey and Terry Scott. The TV reporter Fyfe Robertson appears briefly as himself, covering the alleged sightings of the monster. Plot Struggling young writer Tony Blake (Adam Faith) is served an eviction notice by Mr Slate (Clive Dunn) from his rented room in a Chelsea house shared with other artistic types including abstract \\"flicking\\" painter Arnold (Charles Hawtrey). Tony hatches a plan to drum up interest in his rejected book on the Loch Ness Monster by faking a sighting of the creature. He and his friend Vernon (Terence Longdon), who makes electronic music, construct a phony monster, which they photograph in the Serpentine, startling a tramp (Spike Milligan). The two friends and Vernon's ditzy girlfriend Charlotte 'Charlie' Pinner (Carole Lesley) decide to visit Scotland to further their ruse. Driving in a second-hand Rolls Royce hearse, they pick up a young French hitchhiker, Marie (Marie-France), along the way. They are pursued by Charlie's dipsomaniac father (Freddie Frinton). Tony and his friends arrive at a Loch Ness inn, whose landlord Harry Sutton (Sid James) is trying to conceal dozens of poached salmon from two local policemen (Gordon Rollings and Terry Scott). Tony befriends the local postman (Wilfred Brambell) and other locals, who become more convinced the monster is real when they hear a monstrous roar from a speaker secretly installed by Vernon. The next day, the inn is swarming with customers and the press, much to the delight of Sutton and the locals. However, the crowd's enthusiasm wanes when Tony is unable to produce a promised photo of the monster. In the midst of these events, Vernon and Charlie decide to get married, Marie falls for Tony, and the poached salmon are inadvertently loaded into a police car. Tony and his friends secretly make another phony monster to photograph, only to discover that several locals, in an attempt to draw business and attention back to the area, had the same idea and made their own fake monsters. The locals also discover the hidden speaker Tony used to broadcast roars, and realize they were deceived all along. An angry mob chases Tony and Marie, who try to escape by rowing across the loch, only for the real monster to rise from the loch as the film ends.

After delivering paint near Pinewood Studios, he pitched the script to studio chief Earl St John, who bought it.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jeremy-lloyd-actor-and- writer-who-teamed-up-with-david-croft-for-two-comedy-classics-are-you- being-9945187.html Songwriter and actor Trevor Peacock provided ideas for the story and has an uncredited cameo as a barrow-boy. The script was reworked by Terry Nation. It was the first full film screenplay by Nation, who had started out writing for Spike Milligan, who has a cameo. What a Whopper displayed some of the strengths and flaws that would feature in Nation's subsequent television serials. Among the positives were his \\"ornate verbosity\\" (such as the postman's flowery description of the monster) and his tendency to add new complications at every opportunity, whereas the negatives included loose ends never being tied up (such as Tony's book disappearing from the story), and overt borrowing (such as the modern art parody being influenced by the recently released Tony Hancock film The Rebel).

Early career MS Stena Europe was built in 1981 by the G√∂taverken shipyard in Gothenburg, Sweden as MS Kronprinsessan Victoria for Sessan Line. During the same year Sessan Line passed under the ownership of Stena Line. Kronprisessan Victoria was used as a day ferry on the Gothenburg - Frederikshavn route until March 1982 when the vessel was converted to a night ferry for the Gothenburg - Kiel route. This involved building a large numbers of additional cabins onto the upper vehicle deck to make her suitable as an overnight ship. In 1988 MS Kronprisessan Victoria was sent for rebuilding to make her more suitable for use on the Oslo - Fredrikshavn route, this involved building more cabins which saw an accommodation block added on the top deck. MS Kronprisessan Victoria was renamed MS Stena Saga prior to entering service on the Oslo - Fredrikshavn route. In 1994 the vessel was transferred to the Hoek van Holland - Harwich route. MS Stena Saga was refitted prior to transfer; this mainly involved removing the accommodation block that was added to the top deck in 1988. The vessel was then renamed MS Stena Europe. Following the introduction of the HSS Stena Discovery on the Hoek van Holland - Harwich route in June 1997 the MS Stena Europe was withdrawn from the route. She was transferred to Stena Line's subsidiary Lion Ferry as MS Lion Europe entering service on the Karlskrona - Gdynia route. In 1998 all Lion Ferry routes and vessel were transferred to the Stena Line banner. Following this she reverted to the name Stena Europe. Between 1997 and 2001, she served on Stena Line's Karlskrona - Gdynia route. The Stena Europe will go into dry dock in 2018. Transfer to the Irish Sea In late 2001 Stena Line announced that the and MS Stena Europe would swap routes in early 2002. In January 2002 MS Stena Europe entered the City Shipyard at Gothenburg to undergo a GBP4.5 million refit. All the main passenger lounges were refurbished and the cabins installed on the upper vehicle deck in 1982 were removed returning the latter to something like their original state. With freight capacity fully restored the vessel is once again very much a day ferry. Following berthing trials the MS Stena Europe entered service on its new route on 13 March 2002. MS Stena Europe has proved a popular ship on the Fishguard - Rosslare route. She shared Rosslare for a time with her sister ship, , that was then operating Irish Ferries' services to France. She also shared the Fishguard - Rosslare route with the during the summer months until the end of Summer 2011 when ceased operating the route. In June 2005 MS Stena Europe covered on the Holyhead - Dublin route for eleven days while MS Stena Adventurer was on annual overhaul. In November 2008 MS Stena Europe received an ‚Ç¨850,000 refurbishment to some of its main passenger lounges. The most recent interior upgrade was completed in May / June 2010 which brought about a revamped Stena Plus area a new Barista Coffee bar, and a new seating Lounge on Deck 7. In 2011 the MS Stena Europe was off service twice, once for overhaul in January and again in April for the replacement of an engine in Falmouth. MS Stena Europe went for annual refit in late January 2012 and returned to service on 3 February 2012. Incidents *In January 2003 Stena Europe was in the news when she lost power near Tuskar Rock, just off the Irish coast. Five helicopters were scrambled to winch 155 passengers to safety, but the rescue was aborted as engineers brought the ship back under her own power. *On 6 June 2009, the ferry was called to assist in the rescue of a sailor that had fallen overboard from another vessel in the Irish Sea. The incident happened during the ship‚Äôs regular journey from Rosslare to Fishguard. *On the evening of 26 October 2012, Stena Line reported on Facebook that a minor incident occurred at Rosslare Port involving Stena Europe and the Irish Ferries Oscar Wilde vessel. The 454 passengers and 71 crew on board were said to be safe, although the return crossing to Fishguard was cancelled.

In Hawaii, there are approximately one hundred names for kinds of limu, sixty of which can be matched with scientific names. Hundreds of species or marine algae were once found in Hawaii. Many limu are edible, and used in the cuisine throughout most of polynesia.  Uses  Alongside fish and poi, limu was seen as a major part of Native Hawaiian cuisine. In ancient Hawaii, 75 types of limu were used for food, which is more than the 35 used in Japanese cuisine, which is also well-known for its use of seaweed. In modern times, limu are often used as a condiment and in raw fish dishes, such as poke. Limu was used in ho‚Äòoponopono, the ancient Hawaiian process of conflict resolution. Injured and accused parties gathered to pray, seek forgiveness and eat limu kala leaves as a symbol of reconciliation. It is also used in traditional hula attire and as medicine.  Types  Limu comes from multiple genera *Limu a ‚Äòele‚Äòele (Enteromorpha prolifera) *Limu kala (Sargassum echinocarpum) ‚Äì employed during ho‚Äòoponopono. *Limu koele ‚Äì \\"dry or hard\\" *Limu a kohu (Asparagopsis taxiformis) ‚Äì most popular *Limu a huluhuluwaena (Grateloupia filicina or pubic hair) ‚Äì favorite of Liliu‚Äòokalani. *Limu hina (Hypnea sp.) *Limu lipoa (Dictyopteris plagiogramma) ‚Äì once found in almost continuous beds around O‚Äòahu. Disappeared from Waikiki Beach in the 1960s, crowded out by pollution and the invasive Gracilaria salicornia. *Limu lo'loa (Gymnogongrous long or slender) *Limu a manauea (Gracilaria coronopifolia, ogo (Japanese)) ‚Äì cooked with meats to form a savory jelly. Later diced raw with poke, mixed with chili and salt. *Limu palahalaha (Ulva fasciata) ‚Äì used in hula *Limu a wawae‚Äòiole (Codium edule) *Pakaiea (green sea lettuce ‚Äì named after a shark god who was swaddled in its silken leaves. *Lepelepe-o-Hina ‚Äì shawl of the goddess Hina. Shares its name with a native butterfly and a family of nudibranchs. Threats Limu has become increasingly difficult to find because of over-picking, pollution, and urban development, especially construction in watersheds. Many important kinds of limu grow best in brackish water where fresh water empties into the sea. Another threat to limu is the spread of marine alien invasive species, such as members of the genus Kappaphycus (smothering seaweed), Graciliara salicornia (gorilla ogo), Avrainvillea amadelpha (leather mudweed), Hypnea musciformis (hook weed) and Acanthophora spicifera (prickly seaweed).

Recording The original vinyl release of Human Emotions is divided into two parts, Happy Side and Su-I-Side (with side one filled with songs composed by Coe ‚Äì and some recorded ‚Äì before another wife left him) and side two focusing on the aftermath, with the tunes connected by the sound of beach waves. Coe's long time producer Rod Bledsoe was back in the production chair along with Billy Sherrill, but as Thom Jurek notes in his AllMusic review of the album: In keeping with the theme, side one offers brighter cuts, such as the promising new love of ‚ÄúIf This Is Just a Game,‚Äù which boasted a commercial sound that became a minor hit for Coe, reaching #45, his highest charting single since ‚ÄúWillie, Waylon, and Me‚Äù hit #25 in 1976. ‚ÄúMississippi River Queen‚Äù is a travelogue of outlaw machismo cut from the same cloth as the Waylon Jennings ‚ÄúI'm a Ramblin‚Äô Man.\\" The catchy ‚ÄúYou Can Count on Me‚Äù is a song of utter devotion, while the optimistic ‚ÄúTomorrow Is Another Day‚Äù returns to the Jimmy Buffett sound Coe had mined on his previous song ‚ÄúDivers Do It Deeper.‚Äù Side two, the Su-I-Side collection, begins with what AllMusic calls ‚Äúa masterpiece, with its syncopated vocal lead lines, country-waltz tempo, and huge backing chorus.‚Äù From there, the story descends into a cheating, drunken abyss. ‚ÄúShe Finally Crossed Over (Love's Cheating Line)‚Äù is a bitter study in self-pity and betrayal (‚ÄúMy best friend loved her right out of my mind...‚Äù) and the down-and-out barroom anthem ‚ÄúJack Daniels, If You Please‚Äù would become of Coe's more popular songs. Another drinking song, ‚ÄúWhiskey and Women,‚Äù features Janie Frickie on background vocals. The album closes with the southern rock boogie of ‚ÄúSuicide,‚Äù its riotous groove at odds with the foreboding lyrics. Reception Human Emotions peaked at #45 on the country albums chart.

Created by Alfred Harris, the series focused on the activities of young space lieutenant Frank Anderson (Robert Barclay) aboard the space ship XSW1, along with his crewmate Phil Mitchell (James Doohan, best known as Scotty on Star Trek) and XSW1 captain Steve Cassel (Harry Geldard). Their missions dealt with various space exploration and science subjects, including sunspots, space medicine, and the search for extraterrestrial life. The XSW1 was operated by the worldwide Space Command organization, which concerned itself with space exploration and colonization. Characters at Space Command Earth included Dr. Joseph Edmunds (Andrew Anthony), Ilene Morris (Aileen Taylor), and Dr. Fleming, (Austin Willis). Other actors appearing on the series included Joe Austin, Cec Linder, Barry Morse (later of the TV series The Fugitive and Space: 1999), and William Shatner (Star Trek). Although short-lived, Space Command proved to be a hit dramatic program for CBC's earliest years. Production details As stated over the end credits, Space Command originated at CBC Toronto. The show was aired \\"live\\" in but was kinescoped so it could be distributed to stations across Canada. Accurate credits are difficult to assemble because only a single episode is known to survive and documentation of the program is scant. That episode's technical credits are: Producer Murray Chercover; Technical Producer Vic Ferry. Audio Orm Collier; Sound Effects Bill McCelland; Production Supervisor Robert Allen; Special Effects John D. Lowry and Peter Kirby, which included presentations of rockets and weightlessness. Other sources identify the Producer as Ross McLean and lists the Director as Murray Chercover. The only known Writer credit is Alfred Harris. Harold Wright was technical advisor to the series. Models were created at producer Murray Chercover's residence, and rocket propulsion material was obtained from T. W. Hand Fireworks. Scheduling The series was initially seen on Friday evenings at 19:30 Toronto time on VHF channel 5. The debut episode on 13 March 1953 featured the topic of sunspots. This first run continued until 17 July 1953. Other topics planned for the series included asteroids, space medicine, meteorites, and evolution. From 17 October 1953, the series moved to Saturdays at 18:30, but came back to CBC's Friday schedule on 8 January 1954 for the 18:00 time slot. The final run of the series returned to Saturdays on 1 May 1954, again at the 18:00 time slot. The total number of episodes is undocumented, but the show aired for 51 weeks in total, and if it aired only once weekly the maximum number of episodes would be 51 and claims that report a series length of 150 episodes must be in error. Preservation status Nova Scotia media historian Ernest Dick lamented the loss of recordings of nearly all the series episodes, despite the production of kinescopes for distribution to CBC stations across Canada. The only known extant recording is that of one November 1953 episode. That segment was uploaded to YouTube in March 2018, bearing a modern Canadian TV Classification System TV rating of PG, indicating it must have been rebroadcast no earlier than 1997.

World Heritage. Battista Antonelli (or Bautista) (1547‚Äì1616) was a military engineer from a prestigious Italian family of military engineers in the service of the Habsburg monarchs of Austria and Spain. Biography Antonelli was born in Gatteo in Romagna, and entered the service of Philip II of Spain in 1570, working with his older brother on projects in Oran, Algeria and Spain. In 1581 Antonelli was commissioned by the king to build a fortress along the Straits of Magellan, to protect this vital sea lane from attacks by English privateers. The project, under the command of Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa and Diego Flores Valdez, was a complete failure, founding a short-lived settlement named Rey Don Felipe (later called Port Famine), without any fortifications. Antonelli returned to Spain, ill and disillusioned. He was convinced, however, to take a second commission in 1586 to build fortifications for the city of Cartagena in Colombia. Using the latest military technology of the time, he designed the city's renowned defenses, the San Felipe de Barajas Castle, the San Sebasti√°n de Pastelillo Fort and the San Fernando Fort. Antonelli then sailed for Panama where he recommended the abandonment of Nombre de Dios in favor of Portobelo. At Panama la Vieja at the Pacific coast he developed a plan for a fortification of the town, which was never realized. He then set sail for Havana. In Havana he designed the fortifications which culminate at the fortress of El Morro. From there he returned to Spain. After several more journeys to the Caribbean, Antonelli settled in Spain, working on fortresses in Gibraltar and in other places. He died in Spain in 1616 after having one of the most illustrious careers in military architecture in the New World. His brother Giovanni Battista Antonelli was also a military engineer, born in Italy at Gatteo in Romagna, and died in Toledo, Spain, in 1558. His most important works were a series of watchtowers along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in Spain.  References  *Anne W.

Originally called bsnes (which was later reused for a new emulator by the same developer), the emulator is notable for attempting to emulate the original hardware as accurately as possible through low-level, cycle-accurate emulation and for the associated historical preservation efforts of the SNES platform. Supported systems include the Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy (Color), Game Boy Advance, SG-1000 and SC-3000, Sega Master System, Game Gear, Sega Genesis, Sega CD, TurboGrafx-16 and SuperGrafx, MSX and MSX2, ColecoVision, WonderSwan (Color), and Neo Geo Pocket (Color). Overview Development of the emulator began with the name bsnes, written by a programmer known only by the pseudonym byuu on October 14, 2004. The first version was released in May 2005 for Microsoft Windows. Since then, it has been ported to GNU/Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD. Initially developed under a custom license, later releases were licensed under various versions of the GNU General Public License, although , which helps fund further development. The higan project has contributed significantly to the field of SNES emulation, with a number of original achievements in its emulation, and in reverse engineering developments such as the organization of funds, hardware, and expertise for decapping the SNES's enhancement chips. higan is able to run every commercial SNES title ever released. It is the first emulator to have featured SPC7110 emulation, cycle-accurate SPC 700 emulation, cycle-accurate Super FX emulation, Super Game Boy emulation, and a dot-based instead of scanline-based renderer for Game Boy Advance. It is the first multi-emulator of this breadth to achieve cycle-based emulation for every single component of every system. Forked versions of bsnes have provided emulation support for Nintendo DS, XBAND, Super Famicom Box, Satellaview BS-X software, and tool-assisted speedruns. Reception In 2008, British Internet magazine Webuser recommended bsnes for \\"some fun old-school gaming\\". In 2009, Japanese game magazine GameLabo recommended it for \\"those seeking a realistic playing experience\\". In 2017, components of higan's source code were used to emulate the vintage text-to-speech computer used by physicist Stephen Hawking, after the original hardware began showing signs of wear. Hawking would continue using this emulator to converse with others until his death in 2018.

Many of the workers on this railroad had built homes along Brush Creek, where the railroad crossed it. William L. Hart and his wife Lucy had the area around the Brush Creek trestle surveyed for a town, which was to be named Quincy. This plat was received at the Owen County Courthouse in Spencer on June 7, 1853.\\"Platt of Quincy\\" June 7, 1853 In 1854, the town's post office was established, where it has been still operating since. The settlement of Dunkirk on the western side of Jay County was platted as \\"Quincy\\" in 1853. However, when a post office was being established there, it was discovered that this town already had a post office with that name, so the Jay County settlement was renamed as Dunkirk. The town of Quincy was thriving when a fire was accidentally started on November 3, 1873.Owen County Journal November 6, 1873 Most of the business district was destroyed, including three dry goods stores. Another fire occurred on May 9, 1930 which destroyed the same part of town. The buildings that were destroyed were the O.E. Stewart store, Dunkin general store, the Herbert store, the post office and two smaller buildings. This meant all five stores of Quincy were burned down. The Red Men and Knights of Pythias lodges, which held their meetings in the upper floors of two of these buildings, lost everything. Three of the buildings destroyed were two stories tall.The Owen Leader, May 14, 1930 This and the burning of the Quincy school on February 2, 1953 signaled the end of the business district of the town. The population has ranged between 200 and 300 since the Civil War. The Quincy Picnic A historical marker placed at the site where the picnic was held says it started in 1870 and ended in 1972.

In Korea, patjuk(Ìå•Ï£Ω) is commonly eaten during the winter season, and is associated to dongji (winter solstice), as people used to believe that the red color of patjuk drives off baneful spirits.  Preparation  Dried red beans are boiled with eight to ten parts water until fully cooked and soft, then mashed and passed through a sieve. The bean skins are discarded, and the remaining beans sit for some time in order for them to separate into layers. The upper layer consisting of clear water is used to boil rice, while the lower layer consisting of settled red bean mash is kept. When the rice is cooked, the mashed beans are added back into the porridge along with saeal-sim (; literally \\"bird's egg\\", named as such due to its resemblance to small bird's eggs, possibly quail eggs), which are the small rice cake balls made of glutinous rice flour. The number of saealsim added is often the same number as the eater's age. Salt is then added to taste. File:Saeal-sim.jpgSaeal-sim (bird's eggs) made with rice flour and hot water  Varieties  * Patjuk is often eaten as a meal rather than as a dessert, and by default is not sweetened. Saealsim (; \\"bird's egg\\"), small rice cake balls made of glutinous rice flour is often added to the dish. * Dan-patjuk (; \\"sweet red bean porridge\\") is a sweetened dessert porridge made of boiled and mashed red beans. Glutinous rice powder instead of rice grains is added to the porridge, and the porridge is sweetened with honey or sugar. Saealsim is often added to dan-patjuk. * Pat-kal-guksu (; \\"red bean noodles\\") is a type of kal-guksu (noodle soup with knife-cut wheat noodles). In the dish, noodles replace the usual rice and saealsim.  Folklore and traditions  Patjuk is commonly eaten during the winter season, and is associated with dongji (winter solstice), the day with the shortest period of daylight and the longest night of the year. Cooking and eating patjuk was also a ritual to prevent bad luck, epidemic disease, and influences from malevolent spirits. People believed that the red color of patjuk drives off baneful spirits, as red was a symbolic color of positive energy which can keep negative energy at bay. The beliefs perhaps originated from an old Chinese tale recordeds in Jingchu Suishiji, a 6th-century book on seasonal customs of Jingchu. According to the story, a man named Gong Gong had a bad son who died on the day of winter solstice and became a disease-spreading evil spirit who was afraid of red bean porridge. People began to make red bean porridge on winter solstice to ward off the spirit, and forestall epidemic diseases. Before eating patjuk, Koreans used to offer it to various household deities such as kitchen god. Patjuk used to be smeared on walls or doors, or placed in a bowl in each room of the house. The custom of eating patjuk in winter is also related to Korea's long history as an agrarian society. Having a rich harvest has always been a pivotal issue for people, and eating patjuk became a ritual to wish for abundant harvests. By fully relaxing and eating nourishing food in winter, people wanted to be prepared to start farming in the spring. As winter was often the time of rice shortage, the staple in Korean cuisine, patjuk made of red beans, water, and relatively smaller amount of rice was an economical food. The dish also requires no extra side dishes to constitute a complete meal. Patjuk embodies a custom of conserving food. Although the beliefs on red color and malevolent spirits as well as the agrarian traditions have faded in modern, industrialized society, patjuk is still enjoyed as a seasonal dish in Korea.

Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs, who had himself cast Pierce in the film, thought well enough of his ideal ape-man to introduce him to his daughter, whom Pierce subsequently married.

The small island is a protected area, and one of the very few uninhabited islands in eastern Lake Ontario. Geography Little Galloo Island is approximately from the New York mainland, and southeast of the international boundary with Canada. It is one of a group of four nearby islands which includes Galloo Island, Calf Island, and Stony Island. Natural features and wildlife Most of the island is covered by herbaceous vegetation, with a few trees located primarily around the perimeter. Ring- billed gulls have nested on Little Galloo Island since 1938, and in 1990 there were 84,230 nesting pairs, one of the largest nesting concentrations in North America. The double-crested cormorant was first reported breeding on the island in 1967. Other birds that have been noted on the island include the black-crowned night heron, cattle egret, herring gull, great black-backed gull, Caspian tern, and common tern. The rocky waters and shoals near the island provide spawning habitat for smallmouth bass, lake trout, yellow perch, white perch, brown bullhead, rock bass, and pumpkinseed. Historian Jeff Alexander described Little Galloo Island as \\"an ugly duckling, at least aesthetically. Its terrain and brushy vegetation don't make the 40-acre island a destination for tourists. For birds, it is an entirely different story.\\" History In 1823, patents were issued to Elisha Camp for most of Little Galloo, Gallo, and Calf islands, along with several other islands. A historical map from 1887 documented a structure on the island, though no extant structures still exist. In 1998, Phillips Petroleum donated the island to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC). The island was then designated a \\"wildlife management area\\", used to protect and promote fish and wildlife resources. Conflict over cormorants The cormorant population on Little Galloo Island grew significantly through the 1980s and 1990s as a result of ample food supplies, pollution control measures, and state and federal protection. As the cormorant population grew, so did the suspicion that its predation was causing a decline in fish populations. Because tourism and fishing were a significant contributor to the local economy on the mainland, some residents felt the cormorants threatened their livelihoods and traditional lifestyles. The NYSDEC obtained permits to curb the population on the island. As well, a study begun in 1998 suggested the smallmouth bass stocks in eastern Lake Ontario were being depleted by the cormorants. Before the NYSDEC could take action, a group of men from the local community illegally shot 850 birds in July 1998. Local schools have taken action to revive wildlife on the island.

Recherches sur Diderot et sur l'Encyclop√©die. 1989, Volume 7, Num√©ro 7, p. 142‚Äì144 Grosley was a magistrate in his native Troyes, where he had plenty of opportunity to hear the local dialect, which he described in a paper (1761).Grosley, \\"Vocabulaire troyen ou le parler de la region de Troyes\\", Ephemerides 1761; a reprint was issued (Saint-Julien: √âdition de Sancey) 1984 ISBN B000OW1SG4 . At the time of his death he was engaged in publishing M√©moires historiques et critiques pour l'histoire de Troyes (\\"Historic and critical notes for the history of Troyes\\") of which only the first complete volume was printed (Paris 1774).After his death the work was continued by his friend E.-T. Simon, who brought out a second volume in 1812, reprinting the Vocabulaire troyen (on-line bibliographical catalogue entry ). Grosley accumulated some medieval manuscripts in the course of his researches. A manuscript of the chanson de geste Garin le Loherain with Garey's inscription was part of the Phillipps collection and is now conserved in the Bancroft Library, University of California at Berkeley.Bancroftiana 115. Following his sojourn in Italy as the military administrator of the mar√©chal de Maillebois during the War of Austrian Succession, he published his Observations sur l'Italie et les Italiens. He came in second in the competition ordered by the Acad√©mie de Dijon in 1750, which was won by Jean- Jacques Rousseau with his Discours sur les sciences et les arts. In 1752 he published his Recherches pour servir √† l'histoire du droit fran√ßois; the essay, maintaining the Gaulish origin of French customary law, is divided in three sections: the first presents arguments to show that Gaul was least Romanised in the north; the second that French customs did not have their origins in the anarchic feudal conditions of the tenth and eleventh centuries; the third, that the Roman law did not prevail north of the Loire.Catalogue of books on foreign law 1849 London (The Charles Purton Cooper collection at Lincoln's Inn) Grosley was elected an associate of the Acad√©mie royale des inscriptions et belles-lettres in 1761. Following a year in London in 1765 he produced tart observations on the English style of life, with critical attention to the telling details that revealed for him the English character. His Londres (Neuch√¢tel 1770), was translated by Thomas Nugent and published in 2 volumes by Lockyer Davis in 1772 under the title A Tour to London; Or New Observations on England and its Inhabitants, by M. Grosley. It was read with pleasure by the English themselves. Like the London view of William Hogarth or the London Diary of that inveterate slummer James Boswell,Boswell's London Journal, 1762-3 Frederick A. Pottle, ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill) 1950. Grosley presents a wry and satirical series of portraits of London street life from the fashionable walkers in a rainy, soot-laden St. James's Park to the bizarre holiday capers of butchers' boys and milkmaids. Among other things it contained the first published mention of that English invention, the sandwich. In 1766 Grosley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Grosley was a contributor to volumes IV and XIV of the Encyclop√©die of Diderot and d'Alembert. His New Observations on Italy and its Inhabitants was published in London, 1764. Francesca Wilson wrongly referred to him in Strange Island (1955) as Jean-Paul Grosley, and Nikolaus Pevsner repeated this error in the published text of his Reith Lectures, The Englishness of English Art (1956). In Troyes, rue Pierre-Jean-Grosley commemorates his name.

Early life and education John Canaday was born in Fort Scott, Kansas to Franklin and Agnes F. (Musson) Canaday. His family moved to Dallas when Canaday was seven and later moved to San Antonio, where he attended Main Avenue High School. Canaday entered the University of Texas in 1924 and earned a B.A. degree in French and English literature in 1929. He subsequently studied painting and art history at Yale University, where he received an M.A. in 1933. He taught at Washburn University of Topeka in 1933-34; at Newcomb College, Tulane University, New Orleans (1934‚Äì36); Hollins College, Roanoke, Virginia (1936‚Äì38); and the University of Virginia, Charlottesville (1938‚Äì50). In 1943 he traveled to the Belgian Congo and acted as a French interpreter for the Bureau of Economic Welfare. The following year he joined the United States Marine Corps. He served as a lieutenant in an air warning squadron in the Pacific until the end of World War II, after which he returned to the University of Virginia. From 1950 to 1952 Canaday headed the art school at Newcomb College in New Orleans. He worked as chief of the educational division at the Philadelphia Museum of Art from 1953 to 1959. During this period he wrote the text for Metropolitan Seminars in Art, a widely distributed series of 24 portfolios published between 1958 and 1960 by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Newspaper career In 1959 Canaday began a 17-year career as a leading art critic for The New York Times. In his first column on September 6, 1959, he inflamed the art establishment by proclaiming that Abstract Expressionism, the dominant style of the period, allowed \\"exceptional tolerance for incompetence and deception.\\" Although he acknowledged the talent of the best Abstract Expressionists, he noted that \\"we have been had\\" by the \\"freaks, the charlatans, and the misled who surround this handful of serious and talented artists.\\" Canaday's inaugural column and subsequent articles criticizing this style provoked a much-publicized letter to The New York Times signed by 49 of the nation's leading art figures, who denounced Canaday as an agitator. \\"I have trouble vis-√†-vis Canaday,\\" one artist wrote. \\"What he thinks of me, he can print, while what I think of him is unprintable.\\" Other artists and critics, however, championed him as an honest and articulate observer of the art scene, which continued to provide ample targets for his barbed wit over the years. Author In addition to writing for the Times, Canaday published a number of influential books, notably Mainstreams of Modern Art: David to Picasso (1959), winner of the Athenaeum Literary Award and a popular art history textbook for many years. His experiences as a critic provided the subject matter of two books, Embattled Critic: Views on Modern Art (1962) and Culture Gulch: Notes on Art and Its Public in the 1960s (1969). He also wrote Keys to Art, with Katherine H. Canaday (1963), The Lives of the Painters (1969), Baroque Painters (1972), Late Gothic to Renaissance Painters (1972), Neoclassic to Post-Impressionist Painters (1972), My Best Girls: 8 Drawings (1972), The New York Guide to Dining Out in New York (1972), The Artful Avocado (1973), Richard Estes: The Urban Landscape (1979), What is Art? An Introduction to Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture (1980), and Ben Shahn, Voices and Visions (1981). In the 1940s and 1950s, under the pen name Matthew Head, Canaday wrote seven crime novels: The Smell of Money (1943), The Devil in the Bush (1945), The Accomplice (1949), The Cabinda Affair (1949), The Congo Venus (1950), Another Man's Life (1953), and Murder at the Flea Club (1955), each originally published by Simon & Schuster of New York. Drawing in part on his experiences in the Congo, he set three of his mysteries in Africa, and they were heralded by one critic as subtly foreshadowing a time of change on the African continent. In 1974, Canaday stepped down from his post as art critic in order to devote more time to writing books, although he continued to write restaurant reviews for the Times until his retirement in 1977. Canaday taught several courses as a guest lecturer at the University of Texas in the spring of 1977. He continued to lecture and to write for such publications as Smithsonian magazine, The New Republic, and The New York Times Magazine until his death. Personal life and death John Canaday married Katherine S. Hoover on September 19, 1935, and they had two sons. He died of pancreatic cancer in New York City on July 19, 1985. In popular culture John Canaday appears in the 2014 film Big Eyes, directed by Tim Burton, in which he is portrayed by actor Terence Stamp, making derogatory comments on the paintings of Margaret Keane.

History KJIC first came on the air in 1981 in Pasadena, Texas at 118 watts, playing Contemporary Christian music. The station later changed formats to include Southern Gospel as KSBJ came on the air. Soon KJIC was only playing Southern Gospel music. Around 1983, plans developed that would double the reach of KSBJ and KJIC if the two stations changed frequencies. Once this took place, both stations were able to grow in size and cover more listeners. KJIC grew from 118 watts to 400 watts. During the 1990s, opportunities arose for the station to grow again, up to 7,700 watts. In the early 2000s, the station once again had the ability to grow, to 36 kW, where it stands today. The station also raised enough money from selling 88.1 to buy its own land for a tower, and transmitter. The bulk of the station's operating expenses are met from donations by the listeners. They also offer sponsorship announcements for businesses that support the station, and advertise events and concerts hosted by churches and other non profit ministries. 2018, The Board of Directors has taken a new approach to Country music. KJIC will play mainstream artists that sing about faith, family, or God. The messages in the songs must bring about encouragement, spiritual strength, or share about Christ ordained topics. The change brought about some troubles at first, as those who supported Traditional Southern Gospel, left. There we also some who claimed the station was not Christian, because the messages of some songs talked about faith, family, and love verus songs that speak of God directly. A few months went by, and now 90.5 KJIC has become a new platform for Christian listeners, and ranked the number 1 searched for Christian Country radio station on Google, over 10,000 weekly internet listeners from various parts of the world, and continues to grow.

Also joining the show on this occasion were actors Jelena ≈†kondriƒá and Bora Nemiƒá who participated in various cabaret sketches with Gutoviƒá. Hiatus & cancellation From the beginning of June 2008, the show went on summer hiatus with assumption that it would be returning in the fall. However, on 6 August 2008, Fox televizija announced that Oralno doba will not be included on the network's fall schedule. According to Press daily newspaper's sources, the cancellation was made due to the show's high production costs of ‚Ç¨100,000 per month (the host's salary was reportedly ‚Ç¨2,000 per show) as compared to its ratings that \\"weren't terrible, but weren't stellar either as they were barely above Fox televizija's highest rated programme - WWE's Raw and SmackDown brands - that cost the network much less money to put on\\". Reaction and reception While conceding Gutoviƒá's glitzy populist approach to hosting managed to infuse some energy into the show, Politika's television critic Branka Ota≈°eviƒá felt the problem with Oralno doba \\"isn't so much its concept, but rather the overambitious decision to make it a daily programme\\". The imposed frequency of daily airings, she continued, \\"makes it impossible for the writing staff to come up with enough witty aphorisms, sketches, and one-liners for every show, all of which leads to cranking out banalities garnered with mild wittiness and observations lacking in point\\". She finally reproached the host for \\"conducting his interviews in a monotonous manner with stereotypical questions always prefaced with 'You once said in an interview...', 'it was written somewhere...', you once answered...'. In September 2013 as guest on Veƒçe sa Ivanom Ivanoviƒáem, Gutoviƒá talked about his experiences hosting Oralno doba: \\"Doing that show was very difficult for many reasons. One of the reasons was that I had no say in selection of guests. Another reason was having to pretend I'm having a pleasant time interviewing the guests I didn't want in the first place. And the biggest reason of all was that despite feeling unpleasant about interviewing or even so much as being introduced to a person I didn't want there to begin with, I now had to pretend I'm interested in what he or she has to say\\". Asked to identify his worst guest, Gutoviƒá said \\"so many of them were horrible, singling one out would be unfair to others\\" before conceding that Serbia simply doesn't have enough interesting people for a daily show of this nature.Vece sa Ivanom Ivanoviƒáem;Prva, September 2013 References ;Non- English sources Category:Serbian television talk shows Category:2007 Serbian television series debuts Category:2008 Serbian television series endings ","title":"Oralno doba"},{"id":"17727488","text":"Mohd Hamzani bin Omar (born 30 September 1978 in Johor, Malaysia) is a Malaysian footballer who is a defender.

The Boeing 727 was destroyed, killing all 53 people on board, when it crashed into the Eastern Hills of Bogot√° because of foggy weather and low visibility after taking off from Bogot√°'s El Dorado International Airport. The plane was owned by TAME, the Ecuadorian airline, but was being operated on a wet-lease basis to Air France as the final leg of its flight from Paris.  Summary  The 21 year old TAME Boeing 727-200Adv was covering the final leg of an Air France flight, with Ecuadorian crew. The 3-man flight deck crew was acceptably skilled, according to training authorities, but the flight's captain had logged only about 400 hours in the 727. A flight operations mechanic and 6 flight attendants completed the crew. Forty-three passengers were among the 53 people on board the aircraft. The weather conditions were 7 km (4 nm) visibility, limited by a broken ceiling layer of cumulonimbus clouds 2,000 feet above the aerodrome; a temperature of 16¬∞C; and an altimeter pressure decrease from (QNH 3031 to QNH 3024).  Accident  The aircraft was cleared to Quito International Airport via the Girardot 1 (GIR1) departure, which consisted of a right turn after takeoff (over the Romeo/R NDB) for noise abatement, and subsequent transitioning (via VIOTA) to a south-west route. The flight crew failed to execute the maneuver properly; the first officer, acting as pilot in command, did not make the initial turn, and then forgot to turn the transponder on, which prohibited radar controllers from assisting them. The FDR showed a departure profile with a low vertical speed, and an airspeed of 260 knots, designed to decrease fuel consumption. The procedure was also planned to prevent transit ahead of the 19 DME arc of the Bogot√° VOR, a mountainous zone whose minimum altitude increases drastically to 14,000 feet. Less than two minutes after taking off from the runway 13L, the aircraft crashed at an airspeed of 260 knots into the Cerro el Cable, while passing 10,100 feet. All 53 people on board died due to a combination of impact and fire injuries. The fire also consumed a 10,000 square foot forest area, which was burnt after the aircraft disintegrated and exploded upon impact.

It was rumoured that she became the mistress of her half first cousin Prince Edward, while she was briefly imprisoned on account of her husband's treason.  Family  Alice de Lusigan was born sometime after October 1236Medieval Lands\\"Angoul√™me\\". in Angoul√™me, Charente, France, the daughter of Hugh XI of Lusignan, Seigneur de Lusignan, Couhe, et de Peyrat, Count of La Marche and Angoul√™me, and Yolande de Dreux, Countess of Penthi√®vre and of Porhoet, and sister of Hugh XII of Lusignan. By her paternal grandmother, Isabella of Angoul√™me, Queen-Consort of King John of England, she was niece, in the half blood, of Henry III.  Marriage  She arrived in England on an unrecorded date. On 6 April 1250, her father was killed in battle at Fariskur, Egypt. In 1253, Alice married Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester (2 September 1243 ‚Äì 7 December 1295). He was the son of Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford and Maud de Lacy. He was ten years old at the time of his marriage. In later years, \\"Red\\" Gilbert would become one of the most powerful and important noblemen in the kingdom. The marriage produced two daughters. Issue * Isabel de Clare (10 March 1263 ‚Äì 1333), married firstly Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick, and secondly Maurice de Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley. She died childless. * Joan de Clare (1264- after 1302), married firstly Duncan Macduff, 7th Earl of Fife by whom she had issue, and secondly Gervase Avenel.  Prince Edward  King Edward I of England, alleged lover of Alice of Lusignan Alice was described as being very beautiful with dark hair and dark eyes. She was also flirtatious and provocative.Thomas B. Costain \\"The Magnificent Century\\", Page236 She was said to strongly resemble her grandmother Queen Isabella.Costain, page 236 In the late summer of 1259, she formed a friendship with her half first cousin, Prince Edward, who would later ascend the throne as King Edward I. When civil war broke out and the barons rose up against the King led by Simon de Montfort, Alice's husband supported them. Prince Edward, who headed the Royalist Army, quickly went to war against the traitors who had betrayed his father. Tonbridge Castle, one of Gloucester's properties was captured by Prince Edward's troops and Alice, who was resident in the castle at the time, taken prisoner. It is alleged that the Prince and his cousin became lovers while she was imprisoned.Costain,page 261. Edward's young wife, Eleanor of Castile was in France at the time. Alice was released shortly afterward. At the Battle of Lewes on 14 May 1264 King Henry's forces were defeated by those led by Simon and Gloucester who commanded the second line of battle. After the victory, Gilbert and his brother Thomas were both knighted. Simon de Montfort became the de facto ruler of England. On 20 October the Earl of Gloucester was excommunicated. A month later, he fell out with Montfort and transferred his allegiance to Prince Edward. Later after the Battle of Evesham, in which Simon de Montfort was killed, Gloucester was richly rewarded for his support of Prince Edward and was granted the castle and title of Abergavenny and the castle of Brecknock. He became the most powerful lord in the Welsh Marches. In 1267, he and Alice began to live apart; on 18 July 1271 they formally separated, and the marriage was annulled on 16 May 1285. Gloucester married secondly, on 30 April 1290, Joan of Acre, daughter of Prince Edward who had acceded in 1272 as King Edward I of England. Alice died in May 1290. Through her daughter Joan, Alice was the grandmother of Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan, who placed the crown of Scotland upon the head of Robert the Bruce at Scone.

The book The book describes the clandestine particulars of the business of the Camorra, a powerful Neapolitan mafia-like organization. In this book Saviano employs prose and news-reporting style to narrate the story of the Camorra, exposing its territory and business connections. In an article in 2020, Saviano said \\"We forget what Gomorrah really is: Gomorrah is not a mere synonym with Camorra, Gomorrah is an economic system wherein everything is missing, where there are no investments, no opportunities, no education, no jobs, no resources, no businesses.\\" Since 2006, following the publication of the book, Saviano has been threatened by several Neapolitan ‚Äúgodfathers‚Äù. The Italian Minister of the Interior has granted him a permanent police escort, but he's been often attacked by politicians of Berlusconi's cabinet. Also, his escort has been questioned. As of December 2008, the book has sold almost 4 million copies worldwide. The title of the book comes from a text by Giuseppe Diana, a parish priest in Casal di Principe who was killed by the Camorra in March 1994: \\"time has come to stop being a Gomorrah.\\" Reception  Gomorrah won numerous literary prizes.Viareggio-Repaci Prize for best debut novel, Premio Giancarlo Siani, Premio Dedalus, Premio \\"Lo Straniero\\", Premio Letterario Edoardo Kihlgren for best debut novel, Premio Tropea, the Vittorini Prize for civic engagement and the Guido Dorso literary prize In January 2009 the number of copies sold in Italy surpassed 2,000,000.

Afghan cameleers Although Afghans without camels are reported to have reached Australia as early as 1838, Flinders Range Research - The Afghan Camelmen in the latter part of the 19th century several thousand men from Afghanistan, Baluchistan, Kashmir, Sind, Rajasthan, Egypt, Persia, Turkey and Punjab, but collectively known as \\"Afghans\\", were recruited during initial British development of the Australian Outback, especially for the operation of camel trains in desert areas. The first Afghan cameleers arrived in Melbourne in June 1860, when three men arrived with a shipment of 24 camels for the Burke and Wills expedition.australia.gov.au > About Australia > Australian Stories > Afghan cameleers in Australia Accessed 8 May 2014. They continued to work in the arid interior of the continent from the 1860s to the 1930s, until finally being superseded by the development of railways and motorised road transport. The Afghans played an important supportive role in the exploration and economic development of the interior through carting water, food and materials to remote pastoral stations and mining settlements, as well as for the construction of the Overland Telegraph, and the Port Augusta to Alice Springs railway. They also had an important role in establishing the Muslim faith in Australia.  Brief overview  Prior to 1979, approximately 149 Afghans came to Australia for educational purposes. During the 1980s Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War and the 1990s civil war, over 7,000 Afghans arrived in Australia. The Afghan Australian community has produced a sizable number of individuals notable in many fields, including law, medicine, engineering, teaching and business. In Sydney, the largest portion of Afghan Australians reside in the LGAs of City of Ryde (North Ryde, Macquarie Park, Marsfield, and Top Ryde), The Hills Shire (Castle Hill, Cherrybrook, and Kellyville), Blacktown (Glenwood, Parklea, Stanhope Gardens and Bella Vista) and Sutherland Shire (Miranda). Ethnic Hazaras are believed to reside in suburbs such as Auburn and Merrylands. In Melbourne the majority of Afghans live in Greater Dandenong and Casey. The recent arrival of Afghan asylum seekers by boat has changed the demography of the Afghan Australian community in a significant way. Once only a tiny minority, Hazaras are now more common among the Afghan Australian community in all major cities and small country towns such as Shepparton, Mildura and Swan Hill in Victoria and Griffith in NSW. Smaller communities of Afghans are also found in Brisbane and Perth. Australian residents at the time of the 2006 Census who were born in Afghanistan arrived mostly in the 1990s (7,707) and since 2000 (8,554). Very few had arrived before 1979 (149). 9,356 (56%) had acquired Australian citizenship. A large number of Afghans have migrated from New Zealand because of the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement between Australia and New Zealand.  Cultural centres  In Sydney there are several mosques to which Afghans gather, one located in North Ryde, New South Wales and another located in Blacktown, New South Wales. The Blacktown Mosque is going under reconstruction and will possibly close, due to the small Afghan population in the area. The Mosque may most likely move to Kellyville.  Education  In Sydney there are two Saturday schools for Afghan Australian youths: * Esteqlal Afghan Saturday School located at Castle Hill Library. * Top Ryde Persian Saturday School located at Ryde Public School.  Language  Most Afghan Australians are fluent in English and their native Afghan languages (see Languages of Afghanistan).  Religion  Islam is the declared religion of most Afghan Australians. Additionally, there is a small minority of Christians. The Afghans have a long history in Australia. They built many mosques for worship in Australia and the first mosque was also built by the Afghan cameleers in the 19th century. On 3 May 2014, the largest Afghan mosque was inaugurated in Blacktown, Sydney.

Annular velocity is often abbreviated as AV, though this is not exclusively so, as AV also refers to apparent viscosity which is calculated from rheometer readings from tests that the mud engineer performs. Scope For this article, annular velocity is described, as used in drilling fluid applications in the oil exploration industry. There may be other applications in other fields of study such as fluid mechanics (the study of the movement of fluid) or fluid dynamics (the study of the flow of fluid). Determination The annular velocity can be calculated using one of the following formulas. :AV = \\\\frac{1029.4(PO_{bpm})}{ID^2-OD^2}\\\\, Or :AV = \\\\frac{24.5(PO_{gpm})}{ID^2-OD^2}\\\\, Where: *AV = annular velocity in Ft/min (feet per minute) *PObpm = pump output in bpm (barrels per minute) 1 barrel = 42 gallons *POgpm = pump output in gpm (gallons per minute) 1 gallon = 0.0238095238 barrels *ID2 = inside diameter of the wellbore or casing, squared *OD2 = outside diameter of the drill pipe or tubing, squared *1029.4 = A conversion factor constant used to calculate the volume between the outside of a tube within the inside of another tube, using barrels. *24.5 = A conversion factor constant used to calculate the volume between the outside of a tube within the inside of another tube, using gallons. *Pump Output = Refers to the measurement of the quantity of a fluid (to put that fluid in motion). Application The annular velocity is one of two major variables in the process of cleaning solids (drill cuttings) from the wellbore. By maintaining the annular velocity at certain rates (speeds) in conjunction with the rheological properties of the drilling fluid, the wellbore is kept clean of the drill cuttings to prevent them from settling back down to the bottom and causing drilling problems. The other major variable is the rheology of the drilling fluid. Rheology is sometimes thought of as viscosity to the uninitiated, though improperly. Viscosity (sometimes thought of as its thickness) is a very basic measurement of the fluids resistance to change in movement or flow. The viscosity of a fluid can be measured with a Marsh Funnel. Rheology is the study of viscosity and requires more precise and complicated procedures and equipment for its determination. For drilling fluid applications a rheometer is used.

It is about 50 kilometres from Dharamshala which is the district headquarters. The ancient temple of Lord Shiva (Baijnath) is situated here giving the town its name . Geography Baijnath is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Baijnath It has an average elevation of 998 metres (3274 feet). It is a small township in the Dhauladhar range of western Himalayas, 16 km from Palampur in the Kangra District of Himachal Pradesh. It is also related with Ravana. Baijnath Temple Shiva Temple of Baijnath The main attraction of Baijnath is an ancient, Baijnath Temple, a temple of Lord Shiva. Neighbouring towns are Palampur,Paprola, Kangra and Joginder Nagar in Mandi district. According to the legend, it is believed that during the Treta Yuga, Ravana in order to have invincible powers worshiped Lord Shiva in the Kailash. In the same process, to please the almighty he offered his ten heads in the havan kund. Influenced by this extra ordinary deed of the Ravana, the Lord Shiva not only restored his heads but also bestowed him with powers of invincibility and immortality. On attaining this incomparable boon, Ravana also requested Lord Shiva to accompany him to Lanka. Shiva consented to the request of Ravana and converted himself into Shivling. Then Lord Shiva asked him to carry the Shivling and warned him that he should not place the Shivling down on the ground on his way as Shiva said wherever you will keep me, in this Linga form, I will rest there only, the Linga will be stay there only. Ravana started moving south towards Lanka and reached Baijnath. He was thirsty and saw Lord Ganesha, disguised as a shepherd and asked for water. Lord Ganesh had requested Lord of Water/Lord of Sea (Varuna) to fill the entire in the small pot of water which he offered to Ravan. On drinking it, Ravana, felt the urge to answer nature's call and handed over the Shivling to Ganesh and went away to get himself relieved. Lord Ganesh put the linga on the ground and thus the Shivling got established there and the same is in the form of Ardhnarishwar (God in form of Half Male & Half Female). In the town of Baijnath, Dussehra festival in which traditionally the effigy of the Ravana is consigned to flames, celebrated all over the country is not celebrated as a mark of respect to the devotion of Ravana towards Lord Shiva. Another interesting thing about the town of Baijnath is that there are no shops of goldsmiths here . Another version also suggests that while Ravana was descending from the Himalayas with the Shivling Lord Shiva had awarded him after years of worship which was supposed to be established at Lanka, now Sri Lanka, which would have blessed him (Ravana) with undefeatable powers even to the Gods which was not to be placed anywhere during the course of travel, even during resting, Ravana was tricked by one of the Devas (Gods), who posed as a beggar and wanted help from Ravana and promised to hold the Shivling for him while he (Ravana) could fetch some food for the beggar. The Deva posing as beggar placed the Shivling on ground, in absence of Ravana. The Shiva idol or the Shivling at Baijnath temple is the same Shivling which was placed by the Deva after tricking Ravana. The history of the ancient Baijnath Temple is hazy and the two long inscriptions fixed in the walls of the mandapa of the temple gives us account of the temple. The temple was built in Saka 1126 (CE 1204)by two brothers Manyuka and Ahuka in devotion to Lord Vaidyanatha. The inscriptions tell us that a Sivalinga known as Vaidyanatha already existed on the spot but was without a proper house so the present temple and a porch in its front was constructed. British Archaeologist Alexander Cunningham noticed an inscription of 1786 in the temple referring to its renovations by king Sansara Chandra. An inscription on the wooden doors of the sanctum of the temple provides the date as samvat 1840 (AD 1783) that is very near to Cunningham's date. The devastating earthquake that shook the entire region of Kangra on 4 April 1905 also caused damage to the shrine, which has been reported by J. Ph. Vogel and has since been repaired. At present the temple is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India but the performance of worship and rituals are under a local board at Baijnath with SDM as its chairman. The hereditary priests continue to get a share of the offerings. Tourism Baijnath is around 51 kilometres from Kangra. Besides the main temple there are several other shrines which are of equal importance for the local residents. Some of them are Mukut Nath temple at Sansal (6 km) and Awahi Nag temple (1.5 km) the Mahankal Temple (5 km) at Mahankal on Chobin Road, Shobha Singh Art gallery (Andretta/Panchrukhi 11 km from Baijnath). The town offers splendid views of the Dhauladhar Ranges and numurous mountain streams. Tibetan Monasteries at Sherabling (Bhattu) (5 km), Chauntra and Chowgan on the Mandi Highway and at Bir (14 km).Billing (28 km) is an international paragliding site which is considered as one of the best in the world for paragliding and other aerosports. The site has been the host to international events such as the Paragliding Pre-World Cup multiple times and other national and international events.

The rule, which is an industry term, is named for Fred Pollack, a lead engineer and fellow at Intel. Pollack's Rule gained increasing relevance in 2008 due to the broad adoption of multi-core computing and concern expressed by businesses and individuals at the huge electricity demands of computers. A generous interpretation of the rule allows for the case in which an ideal device could contain hundreds of low-complexity cores, each operating at very low power and together performing large amounts of (processing) work quickly. This describes a massively parallel processor array (MPPA), which is currently being used in embedded systems and hardware accelerators. Implications of the rule on chip performance According to Moore's law, each new technology generation doubles number of transistors. This increases their speed by 40%. On the other hand, Pollack's rule implies that microarchitecture advances improve the performance by another . Therefore, the overall performance increase is roughly two-fold, while the power consumption stays the same. In practice, however, implementing new microarchitecture every new generation is difficult, so microarchitecture gains are typically less. .

The school educates students in grades 9-12 and is part of the School City of Mishawaka. History The first Mishawaka High School was proposed by the Mishawaka Town Board in May, 1873. It was a three-story building located on the corner of Hill Street and West Second Street (now Lincoln Way West) on the site of the Main Junior High School playground at 301 Lincoln Way West. On the third floor was Whitson Hall, used only for entertainment and graduation exercises. Five rooms on the second, including two grade rooms and three other rooms, were used for high school. On the first floor, there were five other class rooms. The first school board consisted of W. W. Butterworth and J. Q. C. VanDenbosh. David Zook was the first principal and E. L. Hallock, the superintendent. The school had only six teachers, two of whom were students in attendance. The first class graduated in 1878. The present Mishawaka High School was built by the Mishawaka Board of Education in 1924. It is a three story building on Lincoln Way East between Wenger and Gernhart Streets covering four square blocks including the track and football field. The auditorium and cafeteria were built after the main part of the high school was occupied. The auditorium was finished in 1925, just in time for the seniors to present their play, and the cafeteria was completed only a few weeks before the summer vacation. The original gym was remodeled in 1959 to accommodate two full-sized gymnasium floors and provide a total seating capacity of 4,000. An additional wing was added in 1963 providing nine classrooms, a reading laboratory, a foreign language laboratory, a music room, and a study hall. The grounds were carefully planned by landscape gardeners before the building was built. The present shrubbery in the foreground of the building was a joint effort in graduating classes and the student council contributions. The gold letters, Mishawaka High School, were put on the front of the building in 1931. The building and equipping of Mishawaka High School originally cost $800,000. The gym was remodeled in 1959 at a cost of approximately $600,000. The classroom wing built in 1963 cost $650,000. To construct and equip. The building and equipping of the stadium completed in 1939, cost approximately $130,000. The Board of Control provided approximately $55,000. toward in its construction and equipment. The Baldwin electric organ in the auditorium was given to the school in 1950 by the Lion‚Äôs Club of Mishawaka, in memory of Mr. W. W. French. The entire school was rewired and fluorescent lighting added in 1953‚Äì1954 at a cost of $125,000. A four-year renovation project (1976‚Äì1980) has resulted in an extensive modernization of the indoor and outdoor facilities of the high school. Major areas of improvement included the auditorium, the cafeteria, the gymnasium, the library, the administrative offices, the industrial education wing, the hallways, the classrooms, and the stadium. The total cost of the project was just under four million dollars. In 1984, another phase of the Mishawaka High School remodeling and expansion was completed. Newly constructed and located between the cafeteria and the Industrial Education Department is a two-story addition that houses the Music Department on the first floor and classrooms on the second. The kitchen and cafeteria facilities were expanded. In January, 1988, a new gym/pool complex was completed. Included in this facility are a wrestling room, a weight room, an all purpose room, and a 1/10 mile running track. In fall of 1999 the science and technology wing was completed along with a new television studio., The new addition features eleven brand new science labs equipped with all the amenities necessary for conducting science class in the year 2000 and beyond. The industrial technology portion of the facility houses a manufacturing lab where students learn about hydraulics, pneumatics, C-N-C lathes, and milling machines. The industrial technology wing also features a CAD (computer-aided design) lab where students are taught drafting skills with the aid of a computer. In the engineering lab the students learn to design buildings and community facilities. There is also a transportation lab where students learn about transportation of people and things on land, air, water, and rail. In the construction lab, students learn about each aspect of construction including foundations, framing, roof systems, and the materials used for various reasons such as climate and other purposes. The integrated lab melds all of the technologies from the other labs. As a result of the new construction, Mishawaka High School now totals and sits on .

The Vine‚ÄìMatthews‚ÄìMorley hypothesis, also known as the Morley‚ÄìVine‚ÄìMatthews hypothesis, was the first key scientific test of the seafloor spreading theory of continental drift and plate tectonics. Its key impact was that it allowed the rates of plate motions at mid-ocean ridges to be computed. It states that the Earth's oceanic crust acts as a recorder of reversals in the geomagnetic field direction as seafloor spreading takes place. History Harry Hess proposed the seafloor spreading hypothesis in 1960 (published in 1962 ); the term \\"spreading of the seafloor\\" was introduced by geophysicist Robert S. Dietz in 1961. According to Hess, seafloor was created at mid-oceanic ridges by the convection of the earth's mantle, pushing and spreading the older crust away from the ridge. Geophysicist Frederick John Vine and the Canadian geologist Lawrence W. Morley independently realized that if Hess's seafloor spreading theory was correct, then the rocks surrounding the mid-oceanic ridges should show symmetric patterns of magnetization reversals using newly collected magnetic surveys.Morley, L.W. and Larochelle, A., 1964. Paleomagnetism as a means of dating geological events. Geochronology in Canada, 8, pp.39-51. page 50. Both of Morley's letters to Nature (February 1963) and Journal of Geophysical Research (April 1963) were rejected, hence Vine and his PhD adviser at Cambridge University, Drummond Hoyle Matthews, were first to publish the theory in September 1963. Some colleagues were skeptical of the hypothesis because of the numerous assumptions made‚Äîseafloor spreading, geomagnetic reversals, and remanent magnetism‚Äîall hypotheses that were still not widely accepted. The Vine‚ÄìMatthews‚ÄìMorley hypothesis describes the magnetic reversals of oceanic crust. Further evidence for this hypothesis came from Cox and colleagues (1964) when they measured the remanent magnetization of lavas from land sites. Walter C. Pitman and J.R. Heirtzler offered further evidence with a remarkably symmetric magnetic anomaly profile from the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge. Marine magnetic anomalies The Vine‚ÄìMatthews-Morley hypothesis correlates the symmetric magnetic patterns seen on the seafloor with geomagnetic field reversals. At mid-ocean ridges, new crust is created by the injection, extrusion, and solidification of magma. After the magma has cooled through the Curie point, ferromagnetism becomes possible and the magnetization direction of magnetic minerals in the newly formed crust orients parallel to the current background geomagnetic field vector. Once fully cooled, these directions are locked into the crust and it becomes permanently magnetized. Lithospheric creation at the ridge is considered continuous and symmetrical as the new crust intrudes into the diverging plate boundary. The old crust moves laterally and equally on either side of the ridge. Therefore, as geomagnetic reversals occur, the crust on either side of the ridge will contain a record of remanent normal (parallel) or reversed (antiparallel) magnetizations in comparison to the current geomagnetic field. A magnetometer towed above (near bottom, sea surface, or airborne) the seafloor will record positive (high) or negative (low) magnetic anomalies when over crust magnetized in the normal or reversed direction. The ridge crest is analogous to ‚Äútwin-headed tape recorder‚Äù, recording the Earth's magnetic history. Typically there are positive magnetic anomalies over normally magnetized crust and negative anomalies over reversed crust. Local anomalies with a short wavelength also exist, but are considered to be correlated with bathymetry. Magnetic anomalies over mid-ocean ridges are most apparent at high magnetic latitudes, over north-south trending ridges at all latitudes away from the magnetic equator, and east-west trending spreading ridges at the magnetic equator. The intensity of the remanent magnetization in the crust is greater than the induced magnetization. Consequently, the shape and amplitude of the magnetic anomaly is controlled predominately by the primary remanent vector in the crust. In addition, where the anomaly is measured on Earth affects its shape when measured with a magnetometer. This is because the field vector generated by the magnetized crust and the direction of the Earth's magnetic field vector are both measured by the magnetometers used in marine surveys. Because the Earth's field vector is much stronger than the anomaly field, a modern magnetometer measures the sum of the Earth's field and the component of the anomaly field in the direction of the Earth's field. Sections of crust magnetized at high latitudes have magnetic vectors that dip steeply downward in a normal geomagnetic field. However, close to the magnetic south pole, magnetic vectors are inclined steeply upwards in a normal geomagnetic field. Therefore, in both these cases the anomalies are positive. At the equator the Earth's field vector is horizontal so that crust magnetized there will also align horizontal. Here, the orientation of the spreading ridge affects the anomaly shape and amplitude. The component of the vector that effects the anomaly is at a maximum when the ridge is aligned east-west and the magnetic profile crossing is north-south. Magnetic anomalies off west coast of North America. Dashed lines are spreading centers on mid-ocean ridges  Impact  The hypothesis links seafloor spreading and geomagnetic reversals in a powerful manner, with each expanding knowledge of the other. Early in the history of investigating the hypothesis only a short record of geomagnetic field reversals was available for studies of rocks on land. This was sufficient to allow computing of spreading rates over the last 700,000 years on many mid-ocean ridges by locating the closest reversed crust boundary to the crest of a mid-ocean ridge. Marine magnetic anomalies were found later to span the vast flanks of the ridges. Drillcores into the crust on these ridge flanks allowed dating of the early and of the older anomalies. This in turn allowed design of a predicted geomagnetic time scale. With time, investigations married land and marine data to produce an accurate geomagnetic reversal time scale for almost 200 million years.  See also  * Edward Bullard * Drummond Matthews * Walter C.

In the local elections 1989 the SHP emerged as the strongest party with 27.8 percent of the vote, winning government power in 6 metropolitan areas, 39 provinces and 283 districts. The Kurdish question placed the party under serious strain as it had seven MPs of Kurdish origin at a time when use of the Kurdish language was forbidden in public and private life in Turkey. Some of these MPs wanted to take part in the Kurdish Conference in Paris 1989, to which chairman ƒ∞n√∂n√º wanted to agree. But after it emerged that representatives of the PKK could also take part, participation was forbidden. Seven Kurdish MPs took part anyway and all were expelled from the party, even though the PKK was not present at the congress and in fact protested in front of the congress against it. As a result Aydin G√ºven G√ºrkan, 12 other MPs of the SHP, dozens of regional party administrators and 3000 party members resigned from the SHP. Nevertheless the party was one of the first parties to acknowledge that the Kurdish Question was not just an issue of terrorism. In the South Eastern Report published by the party in 1990 the problems of not acknowledging the Kurds as a distinct ethnic group were noticed. It was emphasized the Kurds should be able to express their Kurdish identity and legal barriers prohibiting this should be lifted. After the 1991 general election, the SHP became a partner in the coalition government and ƒ∞n√∂n√º became the deputy prime minister (Nov. 20). In the coalition agreement, the SHP insisted on the lifting of the ban on pre-1980 parties which were dissolved by the military government of the early 1980s. The pre-1980 parties were authorized on 19 June 1992. However, this was risky for the SHP. Shortly after the legalisation, a group of SHP MPs resigned from the party and refounded the Republican People's Party (CHP), Erdal ƒ∞n√∂n√º's father's party (most party members were pre-1980 CHP members). The SHP and the CHP, two similar parties, co-existed for a while. On 6 June 1993 ƒ∞n√∂n√º announced that he was planning to resign and Murat Karayal√ßƒ±n was elected as the new president of the party on 11 September 1993.

(ACI,Inc.), a subsidiary of the Araneta Group. The first major shopping mall in the Philippines, the retail area was named in honor of boxer Muhammad Ali, and was built in 1976, making it one of the oldest malls in the country.  History  Construction on the mall began in 1975 after Muhammad Ali's boxing victory against Joe Frazier in Araneta Coliseum, dubbed \\"Thrilla in Manila\\". At the time there were no malls in the entire country, so a member of the Araneta family planned to build a shopping mall with and name it after Ali in honor of his victory. Ali was overjoyed about the proposal and did not charge any royalty fees. The mall has a floor area of and was completed within the year. It was inaugurated on June 30, 1976, with Ali himself attended the ceremony. The mall had many firsts in the country, such as the first enclosed and fully air-conditioned mall; the Alimall Cineplex 4, first cineplex with 2 cinemas (upgraded to 4 theatres); the largest indoor skating rink (Skate Town); and the first food Court (Food Plaza), with its first tenants are Papemelroti, Blue Magic, and Rusty Lopez. https://www.aranetacity.com/news/article/A-Celebration-of-Firsts-and- Distinctions-in-Shopping-Experience Among its tenants include Automatic Centre, Smart Communications, Globe Telecom, Philippine Airlines , Penshoppe, National Book Store, Adidas, and Vans and more than 100 other shops, including food, retail, tech services, and government services, including the Department of Foreign Affairs' DFA CO NCR-Northeast, a passport office located on the second level which was opened in February 2014. In the 1980s, the mall has been undergoing expansions and renovations since its construction, however, during the 1990s to the 2000s, the mall gradually deteriorated, until in 2009, a new expansion to Ali Mall was opened and the renovation was completed in 2010. The ‚Ç±200 million renovation project consists of a fully enclosed footbridge (Ali Mall Skywalk) that connects Ali Mall to nearby SM Cubao, which was opened in 2010 to commemorate the friendship between the two malls. The renovation also featured new interiors and a modernization of the Ali Mall Cineplex 4. In March 2019, a section of the mall at the upper ground floor was remodeled to cater novelty items, antiques, art, music, and memorabilia. This was inaugurated as ALI X, said to be inspired by the grand bazaars of Europe and aims to be a haven for casual goers and hobbyists alike. Inaugural tenants include Happy Music, Remnant's Thrift Shop, and Erin's Artist's Lounge and Cafe, among others.

Details of the exhibition La pubblicit√†, at Palazzo del Lavoro, by Max Huber. Photo by Paolo Monti. Max Huber (1919-1992) was an influential Swiss graphic designer. Max Huber was born in Baar, Switzerland in 1919. He graduated from Kunstgewerbeschule in Zurich under the name Hans Williman. In his formative years, he met Werner Bischof, Josef M√ºller- Brockmann, Carlo Vivarelli and Hans Falk. His career began in 1935 in Zurich, where he worked for an advertising agency and later with Emil Schultness at Conzett&Huber.; He met Max Bill and Hans Neuburg. With the beginning of World War II ‚Äì in order to avoid being drafted in the Swiss army ‚Äì he moved to Milan to join Studio Boggeri. When Italy entered the war in 1941, Huber was forced to move back to Switzerland, where he began a collaboration with Werner Bischof and Emil Schultness for the influential art magazine Du. He joined the group Allianz, and in 1942, he exhibited his abstract work at the Kunsthaus Zurich with Max Bill, Leo Leuppi, Richard Lohse and Camille Graeser. With the end of the war, he went back to Milan. The Italian publisher Einaudi appointed him to creative director for the publishing house. The job put him in contact with the post-war Italian intelligentsia: Cesare Pavese, Natalia Ginzburg, Elio Vittorini, Franco Fortini, Ettore Sottsass, Achille Castiglioni and Albe Steiner. The following years were marked by some of his most iconic and influential designs. With Albe Steiner, he worked for the VIII Triennale di Milano. A keen jazz fan, he designed a series of stunning records covers, music magazines and the set stage for a jazz festival. He met Louis Armstrong. In 1948, he designed the seminal poster for the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza Grand Prix and two years later the corporate identity for the supermarket chain La Rinascente. With Achille Castiglioni, he designed large-scale installations for RAI, Eni and Montecatini. In 1954, he was awarded the prestigious Compasso d‚Äôoro. In 1958, he traveled to the US as a speaker to the First International Seminar on Typography (New York Art Directors Club). In 1965, the Nippon Design Committee organised an exhibition of his work at Matsuya Design Gallery in Tokyo. This trip was the beginning of the designer's close ties with Japan, that would culminate with him marrying the artist and illustrator Aoi Kono. In his later years, he alternated between commercial commissions, personal visual experimentation and teaching graphic design at Scuola Umanitaria in Milan, at Scuola Politecnica di Design also in Milan and finally at CSIA (Centro Scolastico Industrie Artistiche) in Lugano. He died in Mendrisio in 1992. m.a.x.museo, a museum dedicated to his name and preserving his personal archive, opened in Chiasso in 2005.

He is known as the original creator of the open-source 3D creation suite Blender and Traces (an Amiga ray tracer which was the forerunner of Blender). He is also known as the founder and chairman of the Blender Foundation, and for pioneering large scale open-content projects. In 2007, he established the Blender Institute in Amsterdam, where he works on coordinating Blender development, publishing manuals and DVD training, and organizing 3D animation and game projects.  Early years  Roosendaal studied Industrial Design in Eindhoven, before founding the animation studio \\"NeoGeo\\" in 1989. It quickly became the largest 3D animation studio in the Netherlands. At NeoGeo, Roosendaal was responsible for software development, in 1989 he wrote a ray tracer called Traces for Amiga and in 1995 he decided to start the development of an in-house software tool for 3D animation, based on the Traces and tools that NeoGeo had already written. This tool was later named \\"Blender\\". In January 1998, a free version of Blender was released on the internet, followed by versions for Linux and FreeBSD in April. Shortly after that, NeoGeo was taken over by another company in parts. This was when Ton Roosendaal and Frank van Beek decided to found a company called Not a Number (NaN) to further market and develop Blender. NaN's business model involved providing commercial products and services around Blender. In 2000 the company secured growth financing by several investment companies. The target of this was to create a free creation tool for interactive 3D (online) content, and commercial versions of the software for distribution and publishing. Roosendaal moved to Amsterdam in 2002. Due to low sales and the ongoing difficult economic climate, the NaN investors decided to shut down all operations in January/February 2002, signalling the end of Blender development. However, in May 2002, with support from the community of users, and Blender customers, Ton Roosendaal founded the non-profit Blender Foundation.  Blender Foundation  Roosendaal at the Big Buck Bunny premiere in 2008 The Blender Foundation's first goal was to find a way to continue developing and promoting Blender as a community based open source project. In July 2002, NaN investors agreed on a plan to attempt to publish Blender under an open-source license using the Street Performer Protocol. The \\"Free Blender\\" campaign sought to raise 100,000 EUR as a one-time fee so that the NaN investors would agree on open sourcing Blender. The campaign reached this goal in only seven weeks. On Sunday 13 October 2002, Blender was therefore released under the terms of the GNU General Public License. After this success, Ton Roosendaal began to coordinate the development of Blender by volunteers as chairman of the Blender Foundation. With Blender originating as an in-house creation tool, feedback from the use of the tool has fed into its ongoing development. In the first two and a half years of open source development, it was especially this unique attribute of the Blender project that has proved to be difficult to organize and maintain. Instead of funding the project directly by bringing together software developers, the Blender Foundation decided to start a project with the best artists within the Blender community and challenge them to make a 3D animated movie short. The goal of the project was to simultaneously prove that Blender can be used to create a professional quality animation, and to help the development of Blender itself. On 16 July 2009, Roosendaal was awarded an honorary doctorate in Technology at the Leeds Metropolitan University for his work on Blender. On 2 February 2019, Ton Roosendaal and the Blender Open Source Software received the Ub Iwerks Award at the 46th Annual Annie Awards from juried.Ton Roosendaal and Blender receives ASIFA-Hollywood Ub Iwerks Award46th Annual Annie Awards  Open-content projects  In 2005, work on Project Orange began. The result of the project was the world's first widely recognized open movie, Elephants Dream. The movie and all assets used during production were published under the open Creative Commons Attribution license. Because of the success of the first open movie project, Ton Roosendaal established the \\"Blender Institute\\" in summer 2007. It is now the permanent office and studio of the Blender Foundation, and is mainly used as an office for the full-time employees of the Blender Foundation and to coordinate and realize the Open Projects related to 3D movies, games and visual effects. In April 2008 Project Peach, the open movie Big Buck Bunny, was completed in the Blender Institute. In September 2008 the open game Yo Frankie! was released. The third open movie, Project Durian, also known as Sintel was released on 30 September 2010. On 10 January 2011 he announced a fourth project, titled Tears of Steel, released in 2012, and Project Gooseberry, entitled Cosmos Laundromat, released in Summer 2015.

Software compatibility Many image formats are native to one specific graphics application and are not offered as an export option in other software, due to proprietary considerations. An example of this is Adobe Photoshop's native PSD-format(Prevention of Significant Deterioration), which cannot be opened in less sophisticated programs for image viewing or editing, such as Microsoft Paint. Most image editing software is capable of importing and exporting in a variety of formats though, and a number of dedicated image converters exist. Loss due to compression Besides uncompressed formats and lossless compression formats that can usually be interconverted without any loss of detail, there are compressed formats such as JPEG, which lose detail on nearly every compress. While a conversion from a compressed to an uncompressed format is in general without loss, this is not true the other way around. Even a compressed-uncompressed-compressed round trip without any image manipulation may encur some loss of detail. Loss due to format change Like any resampling operation, changing image size and bit depth are lossy in all cases of downsampling, such as 30-bit to 24-bit or 24-bit to 8-bit palette- based images. While increasing bit depth is usually lossless, increasing image size can introduce aliasing or other undesired artifacts. RAW images More expensive digital cameras usually offer the option to shoot in Raw image format. RAW is not a standardized format, in fact, RAW-formats even differ between camera models from the same vendor. Data in a RAW-file is structured according to the Bayer filter's pattern in cameras that use a single image sensor. Debayering, the process of obtaining bitmap data from a RAW-image is always a lossy operation. In addition, some downsampling is always performed, again reducing image information.

The plans for the mall contains a large part of the Araneta City, spanning from the Araneta Center‚ÄìCubao Line 2 station, around the west side of the Smart Araneta Coliseum, to Farmer's Market, up to the current Farmer's Garden and Araneta City Cyberpark. Among the plans for the development include the \\"Manila Tower\\", a planned mixed-use tower. The planned mall will have of retail spaces, with plans including an additional of entertainment spaces, a full scale skating rink, cineplexes, an IMAX Theater, a bowling alley, and a children and family entertainment center, aimed to have a total of of overall retail space in the Araneta City. The master plan commenced with the construction of the Gateway Mall in 2002, and the Gateway Mall 2 in 2017, with future expansion plans including the Gateway Mall 3. The Gateway Mall, along with the New Gateway (Gateway Mall 2), the Gateway Tower the Araneta Coliseum, the Araneta Coliseum Parking Garage, the Novotel Manila Araneta City, and the Ibis Styles Hotel are situated within the Gateway Square complex, offering retail, offices, dining, leisure, lodging, and entertainment facilities, having over 3,000 parking spaces, and ensuring connectivity via sky bridges and walk paths. Development Gateway Mall The Gateway Mall entrance from Gen. Aguinaldo Avenue and the Araneta Coliseum in 2010 Dubbed \\"Like No Other Mall in the World\\", the ‚Ç±2.5 Billion Complex commenced construction and broke ground in October 2002 and was opened in October 2004, as part of the Metro Centro Project of then Quezon City Mayor Feliciano Belmonte Jr.. The mall has five levels above ground primarily for retail use and three levels of basement parking space. It has a total floor area of and is connected to the Smart Araneta Coliseum and Farmers Plaza by a walkway. The mall hosts more than 200 shops for dining and retail, including 5 anchor tenants, a 10-cinema cineplex (Gateway Cineplex 10) which includes the 500-seater Cinema 5 and the Platinum Cinema which is touted by the mall owners as the \\"first La-Z-Boy theater\\" in the Philippines. The mall also houses Automatic Centre Digital Plaza, Rustan's, H&M;, Uniqlo, Miniso, Apple Store, Lacoste, Xiaomi, Robinsons Supermarket and other shops, along with The Oasis (a one-of-a-kind Indoor, Air-Conditioned Garden open to diners), The Topiary Garden, an open-air rooftop garden,https://www.aranetacenter.net/topiary- garden The Food Express food court, and the Gateway Food Park, where public events are held, and fresh grilled foods are being served (Now gave way for the Ibis Styles Hotel and Gateway Mall 2). The mall is directly connected to the lower six retail levels of the adjacent Gateway Tower, adding of retail space, which was constructed in 2013; the 2nd floor of the New Frontier Theater and the Manhattan Parkview via elevated bridge, the LRT 2 Cubao Station, and the 11-storey Gateway BPO Building occupied by Accenture located adjacent to the Cubao Station Concourse. In 2018, the Araneta Group announced its plans for the renovation of the Gateway Mall. The renovation plans for the mall will feature new interior designs in some major parts of the mall. New Gateway (Gateway Mall 2)  The New Gateway (Gateway Mall 2) is an 8-storey under-construction expansion project of the Gateway Mall. Designed to be an indoor oasis with contemporary architecture once completed, Gateway Mall 2 will contain a 9-cinema cineplex, a 3,500 square meter \\"European Market\\" inspired Gourmet Hall, a designated roof deck activity area linking to Gateway Mall 1, a 700 square meter activity area atrium, an organic vegetable garden, an island restaurant-themed food court, a museum, and a \\"Paper Hat\\" inspired, 500-seater chapel, featuring high ceilings and modern church glass windows emphasizing natural light. Construction commenced in 2017 at a cost of ‚Ç±6.5 Billion (‚Ç±5 billion for the mall, ‚Ç±1.5 billion for the Ibis Styles Hotel) Gateway Mall 2 is a part of the Araneta Center Redevelopment Plan aimed to \\"Redefine\\" the mall experience in the country. It is to be built at the west side of the Smart Araneta Coliseum (Red Gate), adjacent to the Ibis Styles Araneta City, As of second quarter of 2017, the part linking to Farmers Plaza is under construction, and in August 2017, the former Food Park, as well as the former parking space in front of the coliseum, along with the coliseum's Red Gate facade, were excavated to give way for the construction of the main building of the mall. When completed, the development will have of retail space, with Megawide Construction Corporation serving as the general contractor of the project. The new mall will also comply with basic LEED development standards. The new mall has over 400 shops attracting 100 food and beverage shops and restaurants, retail, dining, nightlife, leisure, and a supermarket, with Shopwise occupying the basement section of the mall, as the supermarket transfers in a new location, occupying at least of retail space in the mall. The area occupied by Shopwise will soon be redeveloped for the City Plaza, a 5-tower mixed-use complex consisting a 4-star hotel, retail spaces, premium grade offices, premium residential units, and green civic spaces. The new mall will soon also be connected to the nearby Gateway Mall 3 located at the Cyberpark. The New Gateway Mall is officially topped off on February 11, 2020, and is scheduled for completion in the 4th quarter of 2020, to commemorate the 60th anniversary opening of the Araneta Coliseum. Planned expansion Gateway Mall 3 A planned 2-storey expansion project of the Gateway Mall, covering of retail space upon completion. The planned mall initially consisted of 5 levels, but was downgraded to 2 levels. The mall is currently on the conceptual stage, set to rise within the Telus House and will also occupy an open lot located behind the building, located at the Araneta City Cyberpark. The planned mall will also connect all 5 office towers of the Cyberpark and features an outdoor park and additional eco-friendly initiatives. Once completed, Gateway Malls 1, 2 and 3 will have an overall floor area of and will have more than 800-1000 shops upon completion.

He was known for encouraging safe practices in mines. Early life Dunn was baptized at St Joseph's Roman Catholic Church, Birtley, Co. Durham, on 10 December 1788, the son of Robert Dunn (c.1729‚Äì1822) and his second wife, Agatha (Agnes), possibly n√©e Hunter (d. 1790). His father was a viewer at Lumley colliery near Chester- le-Street. Mining career In 1804, Matthias Dunn was apprenticed to Thomas Smith, colliery viewer of Lambton Colliery, Durham. In 1810 he was appointed assistant viewer at Hebburn Colliery, also in Durham, under the supervision of John Buddle, where he oversaw the day-to-day running of the colliery. It was common then for viewers to do consultative or surveying work at collieries other than those to which they were contracted so Dunn gained further experience by accompanying Buddle on visits to some of the other collieries with which he was involved. In 1813 Dunn became resident viewer at Hebburn. His concern for mine safety was enhanced from his experience retrieving the bodies of the 75 victims of the flooding of Heaton colliery in 1815 and later observing that the explosion at Harraton Row pit in 1817 where over 40 people lost their lives was due to a hewer who refused to use a safety lamp. (Dunn and the Rev. John Hodgson had tested the first Davy safety lamp at Hebburn Colliery in January 1816.) Dunn might have expected to inherit shares in the collieries owned by his family and be manager there, but the will of his Uncle Matthias who died in 1825 did not provide for this, perhaps because Dunn wanted to be able to continue his freelance work. Thus for the next 20 years or so he worked at many collieries in Britain and some in Europe. He leased and became a partner in several collieries including Stargate near Ryton, Co. Durham and Prestongrange, East Lothian,(now the site of the Prestongrange Industrial Heritage Museum) where, in 1830, he sank the first deep shaft in Scotland using Buddle‚Äôs cast-iron tubbing to line the shaft. This was a first use in Scotland as it was later by him in Ireland at one of the Castle Comer pits in Kilkenny. The Society for the Encouragement of the Useful Arts in Scotland subsequently awarded Dunn its first honorary medal for his work at Prestongrange. In 1831, Dunn was appointed viewer by the Hetton Coal Company, Durham, but he still had freelance work, which led to tensions with management. His apparent lenient handling of striking miners at the colliery in 1832 further strained relationships, especially as he disagreed with the treatment of the men by John Wood the underviewer and he was dismissed at the end of 1832. He also spent time at Workington and visited collieries in Belgium. As viewer of the St Lawrence Main and Shield Field collieries, he gave evidence on child labour to the Children's Employment Commission that reported in 1842. Safety promotion Throughout his career Dunn demonstrated a profound concern for mine safety and was particularly interested in improvements to mine ventilation and flood prevention. He was a prolific author producing books, pamphlets, and practical papers on the coal trade and mining engineering, many covering safety topics. In particular he emphasised the need for adequate underground air-flow rate to neutralize gases, and promoted developments such as the use of barometers to monitor changes; cast- iron equipment; improved boiler safety valves and wire rope. He championed the better management of safety lamps and encouraged the work of those like William Reid Clanny who made improvements to lamps. He advocated better education for those who managed and worked in the mines, believing that instruction should focus on technology and science, so that mine managers and men were aware of the dangers of their working environment, He began to argue for government involvement in regulating mines, noting that \\"profit is the main object of working a coal mine\\" and that there is \\"the supposition that all persons, proprietors, agents, contractors &c.; are always ready to adopt whatever may be requisite for the safety of the people.Dunn, M. Review of the report of Messrs Lyell and Faraday upon the subject of explosions in coal mines, arising from the catastrophe at Haswell in September 1844. Newcastle, 1845 Owners would choose how safe their mine should be, despite any recommendations there might be from their viewers. A House of Lords Select Committee was set up in 1848 to enquire into the prevention of mine accidents Select Committee of the House of Lords appointed to inquire into the best means of preventing the occurrence of dangerous accidents in coal mines.1849 and in that year Dunn brought out his ‚Äò‚ÄôTreatise on the winning and working of collieries‚Äô‚Äô including some practical ways in which issues of mining safety could be addressed. In 1849 he was an expert witness before the Select Committee where he pressed for compulsory government inspection, one of the few managers and owners to do so. He asked for regulations, but \\"as few and as simple\\" as possible; said that further advances in legislation should be made as \\"the state of opinion\\" ripened and argued for high technical and scientific qualifications for the inspectors and for the development of Schools of Mines.MacDonagh, O. Coal mines regulation: the first decade, 1842-1852, in Robson, R (ed.), Ideas and institutions of Victorian Britain 1967,58-86 The Mines Act of 1850 setting up an inspectorate was the outcome of the Select Committee's recommendations. Mine inspector Dunn was appointed one of the first four government mines inspectors under the Act. Initially he had responsibility for Northumberland, Durham, Cumberland, and Scotland, but his workload was excessive and an inspector to cover Scotland was appointed in 1853. He was relatively poorly paid (initially ¬£400 per annum plus travelling expenses) when compared with government inspectors in other fields - a factory inspector earned ¬£1000 - and many colliery viewers. He did however continue to act as a consultant. The inspectors' influence was limited to recommendation and admonition. Dunn urged miners to contact him if they were anxious about the condition of their pits, stressing that he did not have the power to enter and inspect mines uninvited. His position as government inspector nevertheless enhanced and strengthened his reputation as a mining engineer. He was seen to have integrity and honesty and was generally accepted by owners and miners, though in 1863 the directors at Cleator Moor Colliery tried to have him dismissed.Job, B. The British Mines Inspectorate: the early years 1850‚Äì1872, Mining Engineer 145 April 1986, 426‚Äì31 Following an explosion at Seaham colliery in Durham in June 1852 Dunn and some mine viewers met and put forward proposals for a forum where practical knowledge and scientific developments in mining especially relating to safety could be shared and discussed. The result was the setting up of the North of England Institute of Mining Engineers (from 1870 the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers) which held its first meeting in September 1852. As an inspector Dunn was an honorary member of the Institute Council and gave a number of papers before the Institute. Dunn believed that some technical and practical knowledge was needed by all levels of mine employees to help in preventing and dealing with accidents so in 1862 published A practical treatise on the best means of preventing accidents in coal mines. This was a revision of a book first published in 1852 and provided a checklist of good practice; noted the appropriate duties of managers and discussed the role of inspection. Other activities Dunn was one of the founder members of the management committee of the Newcastle upon Tyne Joint Stock Banking Company established in 1836. In 1835 he produced a pamphlet in association with the engineer Robert Hawthorn setting out the advantages of a railway between Newcastle and Morpeth, intended to form the first phase of a rail link with Edinburgh.Ray, M. Dunn, Matthias (bap. 1788, d. 1869)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2015 accessed 20 June 2016 Personal life Dunn married Margaret Warden Hill Rennie (1794‚Äì1869), daughter of Captain Archibald Hill Rennie of Balliliesk, Clackmannanshire, Scotland, High Sheriff of Clackmannanshire, and his wife, Isabella Mortimer on 19 January 1829 at Alloa, Clackmannanshire, and had four children: Isabella Agnes (1830‚Äì1907), Robert (1831‚Äì1840), Archibald Matthias Dunn (1832‚Äì1917) - who became a prominent Catholic architect - and Margaret Mortimer (1836‚Äì1875). Dunn was also a leading member of the Roman Catholic community in the North East and attended the ‚ÄòGreat Meeting of Catholics‚Äô at Ushaw College in July 1858. Though he had some financial involvement in mines Dunn never seems to have become a partner in any of the major North East colliery companies, unlike people such as Nicholas Wood who became rich men. Dunn lived mainly off his consultancies, individual major reviews and evaluations and later his inspector's salary. In 1866, owing to ill health - though he was 78 - Dunn retired from his inspectorship. He died on 10 October 1869, just a few months after his wife, at Whitecliffe, Caterham, Surrey, where he had moved from Newcastle to be near his daughter.

Statistically, there is just one fatal accident for every 300 million journeys.Safety first. The Economist (23 October 2003) Retrieved 3 December 2006. There are several safety warnings given to passengers, such as the traditional 'mind the gap' announcement and the regular announcements for passengers to keep behind the yellow line. Relatively few accidents are caused by overcrowding on the platforms, and staff monitor platforms and passageways at busy times preventing people entering the system if they become overcrowded. Suicide Most fatalities on the network are suicides. Most platforms at deep tube stations have pits beneath the track, originally constructed to aid drainage of water from the platforms, but they also help prevent death or serious injury when a passenger falls or jumps in front of a train and aid access to the casualty. These pits are officially called \\"anti-suicide pits\\", colloquially \\"suicide pits\\" or \\"dead man's trenches\\". A person jumping or falling in front of a train is sometimes referred to by staff as a \\"one under\\". London Underground has a specialist therapy unit to deal with drivers' post-traumatic stress resulting from someone jumping under their train. Several stations on the Jubilee line extension are fitted with platform edge doors, which prevent people from falling or jumping onto the tracks. Terrorism Terrorism in the London Underground has been a major concern because the Underground's importance makes it a prime target for attacks. Many warnings and several attacks, some successful, have been made on the Underground, the most recent on 21 July 2005, although in that case only the detonators exploded. The most recent attack causing damage was on 15 September 2017, when a man detonated a homemade bomb on a District line train at Parsons Green station. The earliest attack on the London Underground was in 1885, when a bomb exploded on a Metropolitan line train at Euston Square station. The Provisional IRA (and its predecessors) carried out over ten separate attacks between 1939 and 1993. As a response to growing 'Mumbai-Style' terrorist attack threats, the British Transport Police has its own detachment of armed officers who will regularly patrol both the Underground's stations and its trains. Tobacco and alcohol Various regulations aim to improve safety on the Tube. Smoking was allowed in certain carriages in trains until 9 July 1984. In the middle of 1987 smoking was banned for a six-month trial period in all parts of the Underground, and the ban was made permanent after the major King's Cross fire in November 1987., p19 From 1 June 2008 an alcohol ban was introduced on all TfL services. This change in policy was made by Boris Johnson soon after he was elected Mayor of London in May 2008. He claimed that a public transport drinking ban would reduce crime. Fire risk Following the 1987 King's Cross fire as well as the permanent smoking ban on all London Underground premises, the programme of wooden escalator replacement was sped up, and stricter controls on the storage of materials were introduced. Photography Photography for personal use is permitted in public areas of the Underground,London Underground. Guide to filming and photography Retrieved 14 December 2012. with the purchase of a Student/Non-professional permit,http://www.tfl.gov.uk/termsandconditions/14696.aspx to show the photographs to the public (such as on the internet), requires additional payment, but the use of tripods and other supports is forbidden as it poses a danger in the often cramped spaces and crowds found underground. Flash photography is also forbidden as it may distract drivers and disrupt fire- detection equipment. For the same reason bright auto-focus assist lights should be switched off or covered when photographing in the Underground. Criticism The Underground's staff safety regimen has drawn criticism. In January 2002 it was fined ¬£225,000 for breaching safety standards for workers. In court, the judge reprimanded the company for \\"sacrificing safety\\" to keep trains running \\"at all costs.\\" Workers had been instructed to work in the dark with the power rails live, even during rainstorms. Several workers had received electric shocks as a result. Staff safety training facility A special staff training facility was opened at West Ashfield tube station in TFL's Ashfield House, West Kensington in 2010 at a cost of ¬£800,000. Meanwhile, London Mayor, Boris Johnson, decided it should be demolished along with the Earls Court Exhibition Centre as part of Europe's biggest regeneration scheme.

Biography Early life Moruzov was born in Zebil, Tulcea County, to Nicolae and Maria Moruzov; he had four brothers and two sisters. The family was of Russian origin, Lipovans or possibly the descendants of Zaporozhian Cossacks. His grandfather Simion was a priest, as was his father, who served at the Russian church in Tulcea for forty years.E≈üan, p.121 He was married twice: his first wife's family name was VƒÉraru, and the couple had a daughter, Aurora-Florina; after they divorced, he married Teodora SƒÉndulescu, a professor from Silistra whom he also divorced. His education was limited, which delayed his permanent appointment as intelligence chief (the position demanded university studies): he was initially paid a daily wage as a temporary employee. In addition to Russian, which he learned at home, and Romanian, he knew Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Turkish and Tatar (languages spoken in his native Dobruja and the nearby Budjak). Career From 1917 to 1919 he headed the Dobruja Information and Security Service, then from 1924 to 1940, the Secret Intelligence Service of the Romanian Army, which he was instrumental in creating. His clandestine work took place amid a turbulent backdrop‚Äîthe socio-economic upheaval following World War I; the rise of the Iron Guard; the threat, both internal and external, of Communism, and the increasing authoritarianism of King Carol II, who, along with other political and military leaders, trusted and stood by Moruzov for his qualities and successes. Self-confident and ambitious, his intrigues included gathering compromising information on certain figures, amplifying and creating new imbroglios, and even betraying the SSI‚Äôs activities.E≈üan, p.120 His office was equipped with recording devices (on tapes and discs), bugs, detectors, transparent mirrors, periscopes for indirect observation and sensitive photoelectric cells. His powerful Mercedes- Benz had a recording device and a two-way radio. After 1936, Moruzov established schools for preparing specialists, such as radio-telegraph operators, photo and film experts, and fingerprinters.E≈üan, p.124 Moruzov had a keen talent for bringing together an impressive network of informants. Horia Sima was one of these, paid, according to Gheorghe, the brother of his successor Eugen Cristescu, 200,000 lei a month. Others included Princess Caradja (who worked with multiple agencies), Major Cristian Nicolae (a relative of the BrƒÉtianu family), Eugen Titianu (who kept him abreast of events at the newspaper Universul), Miti»õƒÉ Constantinescu and Victor Iamandi (who offered information on Dinu BrƒÉtianu and the elder Liberals), Ghi≈£ƒÉ Marincu (who had links to all the main parties), Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, Nicolae Iorga (who carried out historical studies for the SSI) and Admiral Ion CoandƒÉ. He reserved substantial amounts of money for key figures in the leadership of the Ministry of Defence and the General Staff (one method he used was to rent rooms for them at inflated prices).E≈üan, p.124-5 Downfall Toward the end of his career, Moruzov‚Äôs fascination with the technical aspects of espionage, along with his attitude of indispensability, caused him to neglect his mission of providing intelligence for the nation‚Äôs leaders to consider as they saw fit. Eugen Cristescu later wrote: ‚ÄúMoruzov had long become entangled in the network of internal political intrigues [and] had confused political information with politics itself and the informants‚Äô game with the political game. Thus he also fell into the cascade of intrigues between foreign intelligence services that fought for influence in our country‚Äù.E≈üan, p.127 His activities drew the ire of Sima and especially Ion Antonescu, for whose mother, Li≈£ƒÉ Baranga, he had drawn up a compromising file, and for whose wife, Maria, he had initiated a bigamy trial. Unfortunately for Moruzov, events in the late summer of 1940 brought his chief adversaries Antonescu and Sima to power as premier (with dictatorial powers) and vice-premier. He was arrested on 6 September 1940 and, before the investigation was complete, was killed in the Jilava Massacre on 26 November 1940, in cell number 1.E≈üan, p.127-8 Notes References * E≈üan, Ioan.

He previously served as head of Siguran»õa Statului, the secret police. Biography Early life Cristescu was born in Oituz, BacƒÉu County into a large, poor family. His father Ioan was a schoolteacher there, while his mother's main occupation was raising her six sons and three daughters. His brothers were Ioan, chief of staff at the Ilfov County prefecture; Vasile, lieutenant colonel in the personal guard of Marshal Ion Antonescu; Mihai, commissioner at the Bucharest Prefecture; Mircea, employee of the Foreign Ministry's Protocol Service; and Gheorghe, head of the photo identification service and then a director in the Secret Intelligence Service of the Romanian Army, which on 13 November 1940, a day after Eugen became its head, was renamed the Special Intelligence Service. After finishing primary school in T√¢rgu Ocna, Cristescu attended the Veniamin Theological Seminary in Ia»ôi, graduating in 1916. That year he enrolled at the Law Faculty of the University of Ia»ôi, but interrupted his studies due to World War I. He took part in the autumn 1916 campaign with the rank of sergent TR (reduced term sergeant) in the sanitary service. He continued his university studies after the war ended, and received the title of doctor in legal sciences six years after graduating. Career After finishing university, he worked for fourteen years at Siguran»õa Statului, followed by six years in leadership posts at the Interior Ministry. He steadily climbed the professional ladder, from bureau undersecretary to general director. In November 1940, two months after his predecessor Mihail Moruzov was arrested, he became chief of the Special Intelligence Service. During his whole career, six orders and two medals were conferred upon him. He was sanctioned but once, on 9 November 1932, by the Interior Minister, ‚Äúfined through loss of salary for one day for insubordination‚Äù, without details being offered. Cristescu, who unlike Moruzov was totally obedient to Antonescu, assumed leadership of the SSI at a time when Romania was a satellite of Nazi Germany, formally not yet in World War II but rapidly preparing for it. His political mission included internal espionage against political figures and especially Jews, of whom exact lists with their names were being drawn up, particularly in Moldavia. It was Cristescu who gave the order for a special unit, later known as Operational Echelon I, to enter Moldavia, which it did on 18 June 1941 (four days before Romania joined combat), equipped with information on local Jews‚Äô situation, location and living conditions, and large quantities of posters depicting distorted faces of Jews or which called them spies or saboteurs. Nine days later, the Ia»ôi pogrom was carried out. According to postwar testimony offered by Traian Borcescu, head of the SSI's counter- intelligence section between 1941 and 1944, ‚Äúas to the preparation and staging of the Ia»ôi massacres, I suspect that they were the handiwork of the First Operative Echelon, since Eugen Cristescu told me when he returned to Bucharest: ‚ÄòThe great deeds I accomplished in Moldavia, I accomplished in collaboration with Supreme Headquarters, Section II‚Äô‚Äù. In his own written postwar deposition, Cristescu denied SSI involvement at Ia»ôi, claiming it had been organised by the Gestapo and the SD. It is certain that the SSI armed members of the banned Iron Guard instigated and took part in the pogrom; it is unlikely that Cristescu acted on his own initiative, and later testimony from SSI officers indicates that he kept both Foreign Minister Mihai Antonescu and Ion Antonescu informed about the massacres‚Äô progress. Cristescu closely monitored the significant spy networks operating on Romanian soil during the war‚ÄîAllied as well as German. Relations with Germany were fairly steady until November 1942, when crushing losses on the Eastern Front led the SSI, at Cristescu's order, to cultivate links with the Allies‚Äô intelligence services. Of particular note was Operation Autonomous, in which three British agents were parachuted into Romania on 23 December 1943, captured, and interrogated directly by Cristescu (with Antonescu's approval), who refused to hand them over for questioning in Berlin. Using the three, over the following months Cristescu bargained with the SOE, holding out the prospect of an armistice whereby Romania would switch sides in the war. He was aware of the secret armistice negotiations being undertaken by the leaders of the political opposition with the British and the Americans. Germany pressed for their arrest, but Cristescu (again so directed by Antonescu) assured them their protection, and even took part in the discussions. Downfall On 23 August 1944, the King Michael's Coup took place and brought Romania over to the Allies, but the event took Cristescu by surprise. He was arrested on 24 September, initially interrogated by the Romanian authorities. On 14 October, the Allied Soviet High Command took him into custody; together with generals , , and Constantin Tobescu, Marshal Ion Antonescu and his wife Maria, and professors Mihai Antonescu, Gheorghe Alexianu, and Radu Lecca, he was taken to Moscow, where the group remained until spring 1946. On 17 May 1946, accused before the Bucharest People's Tribunal, he was sentenced to death for ‚Äúwar crimes and the national disaster‚Äù. High Royal Decree nr. 1746 commuted his sentence to hard labour for life, along with those of Lecca (former commissioner general for the Jewish question) and General Pantazi. This decree was initiated by Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu, Justice Minister in the Communist- dominated Petru Groza government. Cristescu died four years later in VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti Prison; the official autopsy record indicated his death was due to coronary artery disease.

Its aim is to remove obstacles to cross-border online services in the EU internal market and provide legal certainty for businesses and consumers. It establishes harmonized rules on issues such as the transparency and information requirements for online service providers; commercial communications; and electronic contracts and limitations of liability of intermediary service providers. Finally, the Directive encourages the drawing up of voluntary codes of conduct and includes articles to enhance cooperation between Member States. Twenty years after its passage, there is wide-ranging discussion, especially in the European Parliament, about how to revise this directive in anticipation of the Digital Services Act. Historical background and aim of the Directive In the 90's, when the general public started using the internet on a larger scale, the European Commission decided to set up a framework to remove obstacles to cross-border online services in the Internal Market. At that time, legal boundaries to cross-border online services were still largely prevalent, which resulted in a lack of legal certainty for online services. In order to address this issue, as well as promote electronic commerce in the EU and enhance competitiveness of European service providers, the e-Commerce Directive was adopted in 2000. The e-Commerce Directive aimed to achieve this objective by offering a flexible, technology-neutral and balanced legal framework.  Scope of the Directive   Personal scope  The regulation applies to information society services. An information society service is defined as ‚Äúany service normally provided for remuneration, at a distance, by means of electronic equipment for the processing (including digital compression) and storage of data, and at the individual request of a recipient of a service.‚Äù The provisions of the e-Commerce Directive thus apply to certain activities or services and not to a specific category of providers. In this context, an information society service includes a broad range of online services, e.g. providing transmission of information via communication networks, online hosting, providing access to a communication network, etc. Recital 18 adds that when a service is free to the consumer, that does not mean that it falls outside the scope of the e-Commerce Directive in so far as it represents an ‚Äúeconomic activity [‚Ä¶] such as those offering on-line information or commercial communications, or those providing tools allowing for search, access and retrieval of data‚Äù. This was reiterated by the European Court of Justice in the Papasavvas case, where the court ruled that a website that was indirectly remunerated through income generated by advertisements could also be qualified as an ‚Äòinformation society service‚Äô. The European Court of Justice also attempted to clarify whether collaborative economy services are included in the personal scope of the Directive. In the Uber Spain case it ruled that Uber is not an information society service, but rather a service in the field of transport as its ‚Äúintermediation service must be regarded as forming an integral part of an overall service whose main component is a transport service‚Äù. In a subsequent ruling, the Court found that Airbnb is an information society service, because the intermediation service forms an integral part of the overall service. With these case, the Court has taken a case-by-case approach in determining whether services in the collaborative economy can be classified as information society services.  Territorial scope  The e-Commerce Directive applies to information society services established in the EU. An information society service is established in the EU when it effectively pursues an economic activity using a fixed establishment for an indefinite period of time. The mere presence and use of technical means and technologies does not constitute in itself an establishment of the provider. Information society services that are established outside the Union are thus not captured by the provisions in the e-Commerce Directive.  Material scope  The e-Commerce Directive does not apply to the field of taxation, the field of data protection, gambling, questions relating to agreements or practices governed by cartel law, activities of notaries and similar professions which involve the exercise of public authority and the representation of a client and defense of his interests before the courts.  Internal market clause  The internal market clause in article 3 of the e-Commerce Directive is one of the key principle of the e-Commerce Directive. This article establishes the country of origin principle, also referred to as the Single Market clause, which ensures the freedom to provide online services across the Single Market. This principle provides that online service providers are subject to the rules of the Member State in which they are established and not the rules of the Member State where the service is accessible. Member States in which the online service provider provides its services must therefore refrain from applying national legislation. Derogations to this principle are possible on a strict case-by-case basis under the conditions set out in Article 3 e-Commerce Directive, also referred to as the notification mechanism. Under this mechanism, a Member State has to take the following steps when it intends to act against an information society service established in another Member State: # It has to justify its action for the protection of public order, public health, public security or the protection of consumers; # Its action has to be proportionate to the objective; # The Member State first has to contact authorities of the other Member State and ask them to act. If that brings no result, it has to notify the commission and the other Member State of the action it intends to take. The Commission then has the right to receive information and assess the justification of the measure. If it is found that the action is incompatible the Member State should refrain from action. Article 3 does not apply to intellectual property rights, consumer contracts, freedom of parties to choose the applicable law, the validity of contracts in real estate and the permissibility of unsolicited commercial communications by electronic mail.  Freedom of establishment  Article 4 e-Commerce Directive establishes that information society service providers may not be made subject to prior authorization by Member States before starting any activities.  Basic rules for e-commerce  Articles 5-11 of the e-Commerce Directive set out some of the basic requirements for online services, which include requirements for commercial communications, requirements for electronic contracts and information obligations towards consumers. Liability of intermediaries Articles 12-14 of the e-Commerce Directive set out the limited liability exemptions, also referred to as the safe harbors, which contain the conditions under which certain intermediary service providers are exempted from liability for third party content. The e-Commerce Directive does not provide a definition for intermediary service providers; rather it provides for specific types of activities to be conditionally exempted from liability, specifically: * Mere conduit; * Caching; and * Hosting. Only when a service falls under one of the specific activities can it be exempted from liability. The safe harbors do not prevent intermediaries from taking measures against the infringement of third party rights, either through injunctions or duties of care, as was set out in case law and various legal instruments. The exemptions in the e-Commerce Directive have a horizontal scope, covering all types of illegal content (e.g. infringements of copyright, defamation, etc.) as well as both civil and criminal liability. Mere conduit Article 12 of the e-Commerce Directive contains the safe harbor for mere conduit. Mere conduit is when an information society service is provided that consists of the transmission in a communication network of information provided by a recipient of the service or the provision of access to a communication network. The service provider shall not be liable for the information transmitted, on the condition that the provider: * does not initiate the transmission; * does not select the receiver of the transmission; and * does not select or modify the information contained in the transmission. Further, the article states that the acts of transmission and of provision of access include the automatic, intermediate and transient storage of the information transmitted in so far as this takes place for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission in the communication network, and provided that the information is not stored for any period longer than is reasonably necessary for the transmission.  Caching  Article 13 of the e-Commerce Directive contains the safe harbor for caching. Caching services consist of the transmission in a communication network of information provided by a recipient of the service. The article ensures that a caching service provider is not liable for the automatic, intermediate and temporary storage of that information, performed for the sole purpose of making more efficient the information's onward transmission to other recipients of the service upon their request, provided that: * the provider does not modify the information; * the provider complies with conditions on access to the information; * the provider complies with rules regarding the updating of the information, specified in a manner widely recognized and used by industry; * the provider does not interfere with the lawful use of technology, widely recognized and used by industry, to obtain data on the use of the information; and * the provider acts expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information it has stored upon obtaining actual knowledge of the fact that the information at the initial source of the transmission has been removed from the network, or access to it has been disabled, or that a court or an administrative authority has ordered such removal or disablement. Hosting Article 14 of the e-Commerce Directive is arguably one of the most discussed articles in the e-Commerce Directive, in part due to the extensive body of case law related to the article. This article relates to hosting, which consists of the storage of information provided by a recipient of the service. Under this article, the hosting provider is not liable for the information stored at the request of a recipient of the service on the condition that: * the provider does not have actual knowledge of illegal activity or information and, as regards claims for damages, is not aware of facts or circumstances from which the illegal activity or information is apparent; or * the provider, upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information. Thus, Article 14 of the e-Commerce Directive provides that the provider, upon obtaining knowledge or awareness of illegal content, acts expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information. Article 14 of the e-Commerce Directive provides the basis for the development of notice and take down procedures for illegal and harmful information. The Directive does not set out any procedural obligations for notice and takedown, but Member States have the possibility to establish their own conditions for procedures. Article 14 e-Commerce Directive has been further interpreted by several cases in front of the European Court of Justice. These cases have provided further information on the conditions under which the safe harbor is to apply. Parallels exist between the intermediary liability provisions in these articles and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act#European Union of the USA. = Definition hosting provider = Hosting is ‚Äúwhere an information society service is provided that consists of the storage of information provided by a recipient of the service.‚Äù Article 14(1) of the e-Commerce Directive does not specify further what type of services constitute hosting. In this void, the Court of Justice has been left to determine on a case-by-case basis what type of services constitute hosting providers. In its case law, it has applied article 14 of the e-Commerce Directive to a search engine's advertising services, an online sales platform and a social networking platform. = Active versus passive hosting = The European Court of Justice has added a further dimension in the Google France and L‚ÄôOr√©al cases, where it established that only ‚Äúpassive‚Äù or ‚Äúneutral‚Äù hosts may benefit from the safe harbour. In the Google France case the Court ruled that a service provider could only benefit from the safe harbour if it is neutral, in which case the activity is ‚Äúof a mere technical, automatic and passive nature‚Äù, which implies that that service provider ‚Äúhas neither knowledge of nor control over the information which is transmitted or stored.‚Äô‚Äù The Court based its reasoning on recital 42 e-Commerce Directive, which is directed towards mere conduit and caching services. In the L‚ÄôOr√©al case the Court further provided that the safe harbour in article 14 of the e-Commerce Directive only applies to service providers if they have not played an active role of such a kind as to give it knowledge of, or control over, the stored data. The Court further set some identifying factors as to what can be considered active, e.g. setting the terms of service was not considered as acting in an active manner whereas optimizing the presentation of offers for sale was considered as acting in an active manner. = Knowledge or awareness = Article 14(1) contains two distinct knowledge standards (i) ‚Äúactual knowledge‚Äù and (ii) ‚Äúawareness of the facts or circumstances from which the illegal activity or information is apparent‚Äù or constructive knowledge. This distinction is important as it clarifies that criminal liability would require actual knowledge whereas civil liability would solely require constructive knowledge. In order for actual knowledge to be triggered for the purpose of article 14 e-Commerce Directive a notification needs to be sufficiently precise and adequately motivated. This has been further substantiated by the European Commission in the Commission Recommendation on measures to effectively tackle illegal content online. A Service provider has awareness as in Article 14 e-Commerce Directive ‚Äúif it was aware of facts or circumstances on the basis of which a diligent economic operator should have realised‚Äù that the content was unlawful and did not act expeditiously to take it down. = Expeditious action = Finally, in order to benefit from the liability exemption under Article 14 of the e-Commerce Directive, upon obtaining actual knowledge hosting services are required to act expeditiously against the notified illegal content. It remains largely unclear what action would qualify as acting ‚Äúexpeditiously‚Äù. = Conclusion hosting = After nearly 20 years of cases from the European Court of Justice, a complicated and sometimes conflicting body of case law remains. This creates legal uncertainty for companies hoping to benefit from the safe harbour in article 14 e-Commerce Directive.  Prohibition on general monitoring obligation  Article 15 e-Commerce Directive prohibits Member States from imposing general monitoring obligations on online intermediaries. In essence, this means that it is prohibited to require from intermediaries that they actively seek facts or circumstances indicating illegal activity. This prohibition on general monitoring has been confirmed on several occasions by the European Court of Justice. In the Netlog and Scarlet Extended cases the Court held that general monitoring obligations, such as filtering measures, fail to strike the right balance between copyright enforcement and fundamental rights. The prohibition only applies to monitoring of a general nature, monitoring obligations in specific cases and orders by national authorities in accordance with national legislation are allowed. This was further substantiated in the Telekabel case, where the Court held that a filtering injunction which was strictly targeted and did not breach fundamental rights was allowed. The e-Commerce Directive does allow Member States to allow internet service providers to apply duties of care to detect and prevent certain types of illegal activities. Member States can only impose such duties of care when they can be reasonably expected from online intermediaries and are included in national legislation.  Final provisions in the e-Commerce Directive  The final provisions in the e-Commerce Directive relate to cooperation and enforcement, particularly they encourage the drawing up of voluntary codes of conduct and includes articles to enhance cooperation between Member States. Furthermore, the final chapter contains provisions related to out-of-court dispute settlement, court actions and sanctions.  Tensions  A number of developments have put pressure on the e-Commerce Directive. Since its adoption in the year 2000, the online environment has changed significantly, with a change in the scale of online services and a much wider diversity of services. Furthermore, new types of services have developed that do not specifically fall into the legal categories set out in the e-Commerce Directive as they were still in their infancy in 2000, e.g. collaborative economy services or online advertising.

They are topped with a thick layer of chocolate fudge that derives from a German recipe, and are a cultural icon of Baltimore.  History  The Berger Cookie recipe was brought to America from Germany by George and Henry Berger in 1835. Henry owned a bakery in East Baltimore that was later run by his son Henry. While the younger Henry took over his father's bakery, his two brothers, George and Otto, opened their own bakeries. Around 1900 Otto died, then George and Henry combined the bakeries to create 'Bergers'. As technology grew so did the bakery. Eventually Henry died, leaving George as the sole proprietor of the bakery. When George retired he sold the bakery and the recipe to Charles E. Russell. Charles' son, Charles Jr., took control upon his father's retirement. Charles Jr. and his sons, Charles III and Dennis, ran the business through the Depression. They employed two brothers, Charles and Benjamin DeBaufre. When Charles Jr. retired in 1967, he left the bakery to Charles III and Dennis. Meanwhile, the DeBaufre brothers left the business to start DeBaufre Bakeries Inc. The DeBaufre Bakery struggled in the first few years but they pushed through it. DeBaufre Bakeries was able to earn enough of a profit to purchase Berger's from the Russell family in 1969. Charles' son, Charles DeBaufre Jr., purchased part of the business in 1978. Charles Sr. died in 1988 leaving ownership to Benjamin, Charles Jr., and John Koehler. Charles Jr. became the sole proprietor of Berger Cookies in 1994 when Benjamin retired and is still running the successful business in 2019.  Production and sales  The Berger cookie is well known for its thick chocolate frosting layered on top of a shortbread cookie. The recipe has won several awards around the Baltimore area including the 2011 \\"Best of Baltimore Award\\" and the \\"Best Cookie\\" award in 2011. The product has also been featured in The Baltimore Sun, The View, and on Rachael Ray and The Best Thing I Ever Ate on the Food Network. Berger Cookies are handmade in a small factory in the Cherry Hill neighborhood of Baltimore. As of 2013, four employees dipped a total of around 36,000 cookies every day.‚ÄúThe Berger Cookie Is Baltimore's Gift to the Chocolate World.‚Äù Smithsonian.com, Smithsonian Institution, 28 Jan. 2013, www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-berger-cookie-is-baltimores-gift-to- the-chocolate-world-6918029/. The original recipe that was created by Henry Berger in 1835 is still in use.‚ÄúAbout Bergers Cookies - A Maryland-Based Cookie Company.‚Äù Magento Commerce, www.bergercookies.com/about_us. As of early 2012, the annual sales of DeBaufre Bakeries were about $2.5 million, with Berger Cookies making up 98% of that. In February 2012, the company began a limited run of three flavors, strawberry, lemon and rum, that it had last made in 1972, in response to slower sales in January. However, that was just a special edition and was not meant to be something that lasted longer than the week that DeBaufre Bakery sold them for.Lambert, Jack. ‚ÄúBerger Cookies to Roll out Limited Edition Flavors.‚Äù Bizjournals.com, The Business Journals, www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/news/2012/02/03/bergers-cookies-to-roll-out- limited.html. The Health Department closed the bakery in January 2013 because it was operating without the proper license. The bakery does have a federal food license, according to the FDA, and officials there have an ongoing investigation stemming from a routine inspection in January. A spokesman declined to comment on what the investigators have found. Records show the FDA, which does not communicate about its findings with the city, inspected the bakery at least once before, in 2011, and found no serious violations. The bakery has since obtained the proper licenses needed and resumed production March 5, 2013. In November 2013 owner and president Charles DeBaufre, Jr. said that the FDA's proposed ban on trans fat could change how Berger Cookies taste because two key ingredients, margarine and fudge, contain partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil, a source of trans fat. He said attempts to produce the cookies without trans fat have produced discouraging results. He further said that without an FDA exception allowing them to use trans fat, the bakery would continue to test out new recipes or \\"go out of business, one of the two.\\" However, in November 2017 The Baltimore Sun reported that DeBaufre's fudge supplier had already changed the recipe and eliminated trans fats over the previous summer, with no apparent impact on the taste but an increase in calories due to additional sweeteners.

Crosby and Martin sang \\"Only Forever\\", for which James V. Monaco (music) and Johnny Burke (lyrics) were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Plot Oliver Courtney (Basil Rathbone) is an arrogant composer who lets other people write songs he takes credit for. Bob Sommers (Bing Crosby) writes his tunes with Billy Starbuck (Oscar Levant). At the night of a social Christmas party, Oliver introduces Bob's song \\"What Would Shakespeare Have Said?\\" as his own. Later that night, Oliver thanks Bob for his loyalty and offers him a contract for $50 a week for three years. He refuses, saying he would rather have a catboat to visit his uncle at his river hotel, called Nobody's Inn. After his lyric writer dies, Oliver finds a replacement in Cherry Lane (Mary Martin). She is reluctant about being a ghost writer, but accepts his offer. He is satisfied with her first lyric. She becomes ambitious to write better lines, but is not able to concentrate at home, and it is suggested she move to a small and quiet place. Meanwhile, Bob and Cherry meet several times, without knowing they are working for the same employer. She does not think highly of him. To work in a perfect environment, Cherry travels to Tarrytown and stays at Nobody's Inn. Bob decides to give the inn a visit at the same time, and they are shocked to run into each other yet again. They soon become acquainted and actually start liking each other. They even compose their own song together. However, because they are not allowed to tell who they are working for, they do not find out they are colleagues. She becomes mad at him when he plays the song she wrote the lines for and states he wrote it himself. Bob is confused and travels back to town to resign. Cherry has come to office as well to inform her boss she thinks someone has stolen his lines. They realize they were working together all along. Bob and Cherry make up and decide to start their own music composing careers. After a few unsuccessful auditions, Bob agrees to start a band. They audition for Mr. Westlake (William Frawley), but he is only interested in Cherry. He offers her a job as a nightclub singer, but she is loyal to the band and rejects his offer. Bob notices it is a great opportunity for Cherry and gives her his consent to work for Westlake. He takes his job back as Oliver's ghost writer and raises $200 so Cherry can premiere with the song they wrote together at Nobody's Inn. However, she is unhappy at her new job and is helped by Bob to get out of her contract. Oliver feels sympathetic toward them and persuades them not to walk away by announcing the song is not written by him. After announcing they will soon marry, Bob and Cherry perform their song.

Thirteen half-hour episodes were produced and aired from September 8, 1984 to April 27, 1985 on ABC. Synopsis The series chronicles the adventures of Dirk the Daring, who is the best knight in the kingdom of King Ethelred. Dirk performs all sorts of great deeds while protecting the kingdom and his love Princess Daphne from the forces of the evil dragon Singe. In his adventures there are several original characters like his stallion Bertram, his squire Timothy, and arrogant knight Sir Hubert Blunt who is Dirk the Daring's rival. Before each commercial break, Dirk the Daring faces a cliffhanger, and, in keeping with the spirit of the game, the storyteller narrates Dirk's options and asks the viewer \\"What would you do?\\". After the commercial break, the outcomes of the various choices were shown before Dirk acts on the correct idea (with the occasional exception) to advance the story. Several enemies from the original game also make their appearance as adversaries: the Lizard King, the Phantom Knight, the Giddy Goons, and the Mudmen. In the episode \\"The Legend of the Giant's Name\\", an Ardu giant awakened by Singe forces Dirk to find his way out of an enchanted cave, which gradually transforms him into a skeleton, much like the death animations of the game.

The apparent viscosity of a dilatant fluid is higher when measured at a higher shear rate (Œ∑‚ÇÑ is higher than Œ∑‚ÇÉ), while the apparent viscosity of a Bingham plastic is lower (Œ∑‚ÇÇ is lower than Œ∑‚ÇÅ). Apparent viscosity (sometimes denoted Œ∑) is the shear stress applied to a fluid divided by the shear rate (\\\\eta = \\\\frac{\\\\tau}{\\\\dot\\\\gamma}). For a Newtonian fluid, the apparent viscosity is constant, and equal to the Newtonian viscosity of the fluid, but for non-Newtonian fluids, the apparent viscosity depends on the shear rate. Apparent viscosity has the SI derived unit Pa¬∑s (Pascal-second, but the centipoise is frequently used in practice: (1 mPa¬∑s = 1 cP). Application A single viscosity measurement at a constant speed in a typical viscometer is a measurement of the apparent viscosity of a fluid. In the case of non-Newtonian fluids, measurement of apparent viscosity without knowledge of the shear rate is of limited value: the measurement cannot be compared to other measurements if the speed and geometry of the two instruments is not identical. An apparent viscosity that is reported without the shear rate or information about the instrument and settings (e.g. speed and spindle type for a rotational viscometer) is meaningless. Multiple measurements of apparent viscosity at different, well-defined shear rates, can give useful information about the non-Newtonian behaviour of a fluid, and allow it to be modeled.  Power-law fluids  In many non-Newtonian fluids, the shear stress due to viscosity, \\\\tau_{xy} , can be modeled by : \\\\tau_{xy} = k \\\\left (\\\\frac{du}{dy}\\\\right ) ^n where * k is the consistency index * n is the flow behavior index * du/dy is the shear rate, with velocity u and position y These fluids are called power-law fluids.

The in vitro protein synthesis environment is not constrained by a cell wall or homeostasis conditions necessary to maintain cell viability. Thus, CFPS enables direct access and control of the translation environment which is advantageous for a number of applications including co-translational solubilisation of membrane proteins, optimisation of protein production, incorporation of non-natural amino acids, selective and site-specific labelling. Due to the open nature of the system, different expression conditions such as pH, redox potentials, temperatures, and chaperones can be screened. Since there is no need to maintain cell viability, toxic proteins can be produced. Introduction Common components of a cell-free reaction include a cell extract, an energy source, a supply of amino acids, cofactors such as magnesium, and the DNA with the desired genes. A cell extract is obtained by lysing the cell of interest and centrifuging out the cell walls, DNA genome, and other debris. The remains are the necessary cell machinery including ribosomes, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, translation initiation and elongation factors, nucleases, etc. Two types of DNA can be used in CFPS: plasmids and linear expression templates (LETs). Plasmids are circular, and only made inside cells. LETs can be made much more effectively via PCR , which replicates DNA much faster than raising cells in an incubator. While LETs are easier and faster to make, plasmid yields are usually much higher in CFPS. Because of this, much research today is focused on optimizing CFPS LET yields to approach the yields of CFPS with plasmids. An energy source is an important part of a cell-free reaction. Usually, a separate mixture containing the needed energy source, along with a supply of amino acids, is added to the extract for the reaction. Common sources are phosphoenol pyruvate, acetyl phosphate, and creatine phosphate. Advantages and Applications CFPS has many advantages over the traditional in vivo synthesis of proteins. Most notably, a cell-free reaction, including extract preparation, usually takes 1 ‚Äì2 days, whereas in vivo protein expression may take 1‚Äì2 weeks.https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2020.00941/ CFPS is an open reaction. The lack of cell wall allows direct manipulation of the chemical environment. Samples are easily taken, concentrations optimized, and the reaction can be monitored. In contrast, once DNA is inserted into live cells, the reaction cannot be accessed until it is over and the cells are lysed. Another advantage to CFPS is the lack of concern for toxicity. Some desired proteins and labeled proteins are toxic to cells when synthesized. Since live cells are not being used, the toxicity of the product protein is not a significant concern. These advantages enable numerous applicationshttps://cellfreesystems.org/. A major application of CFPS is incorporation of unnatural amino acids into protein structures (see expanded genetic code). The openness of the reaction is ideal for inserting the modified tRNAs and unnatural amino acids required for such a reaction. Synthetic biology has many other uses and is a bright future in fields such as protein evolution, nanomachines, nucleic acid circuits, and synthesis of virus-like particles for vaccines and drug therapy. Limitations One challenge associated with CFPS is the degradation of the DNA by endogenous nucleases in the cell extract. This is particularly problematic with LETs. Cells have endonucleases that attack random sites of a DNA strands; however, much more common are the exonucleases which attack DNA from the ends. Since plasmids are circular and have no end to which the exonucleases may attach, they are not affected by the latter. LETs, however, are susceptible to both. Because of LET vulnerability, much research today is focused on optimizing CFPS LET yields to approach the yields of CFPS using plasmids. One example of this improved protection with plasmids is use of the bacteriophage lambda gam protein. Gam is an inhibitor of RecBCD, an exonuclease found in Escherichia coli (E. coli). With the use of gam, CFPS yields with LETs were greatly increased, and were comparable to CFPS yields with plasmids. PURE extracts can also be made, eliminating the concern of exonucleases. These extracts are expensive to make and are not currently an economical solution to the issue of exogenous DNA degradation. Types of Cell-free systems Common cell extracts in use today are made from E. coli (ECE), rabbit reticulocytes (RRL), wheat germ (WGE), insect cells (ICE) and Yeast Kluyveromyces (the D2P system). All of these extracts are commercially available. ECE is the most popular lysate for several reasons. It is the most inexpensive extract and the least time intensive to create. Also, large amounts of E. coli are easily grown, and then easily lysed through use of a homogenizer or a sonicator. ECE also provides the highest protein yields. However, high yield production can limit the complexity of the synthesized protein, particularly in post-translational modification. In that regard, the lower efficient eukaryotic systems could be advantageous, provided that modifying enzyme systems have been maintained in the extracts. Each eukaryotic system has their advantages and disadvantages. For example, WGE extract produces the highest yields of the three eukaryotic extracts; however, it is not as effective for some post-translational modifications such as glycosylation. When choosing an extract, the type of post-translational modification, desired yields, and cost should be taken into account. History Cell-free protein synthesis has been used for over 60 years, and notably, the first elucidation of a codon was done by Marshall Nirenberg and Heinrich J. Matthaei in 1961 at the National Institutes of Health. They used a cell-free system to translate a poly-uracil RNA sequence (or UUUUU... in biochemical terms) and discovered that the polypeptide they had synthesized consisted of only the amino acid phenylalanine. They thereby deduced from this poly-phenylalanine that the codon UUU specified the amino- acid phenylalanine. Extending this work, Nirenberg and his coworkers were able to determine the nucleotide makeup of each codon.

Life  Fatos, son of Todi Lubonja, who was a close associate of Enver Hoxha and head of Albanian national television until the early 1970s, is an Albanian political analyst. In the course of Hoxha's split with the USSR in 1960, Todi Lubonja was arrested for voicing opposition. Fatos, who had been studying physics in Tirana, was also arrested due to the discovery of his diary, which was very critical of Hoxha. Fatos Lubonja was initially sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. He was accused of belonging to a pro-Soviet circle in the prison and was sentenced to twenty more years. After having spent thirteen years at hard labor, he was moved to solitary confinement. There he wrote a diary and a novel on cigarette paper, which was concealed in the spine of a dictionary. His novel The Last Massacre is a take on communism under Hoxha. Fatos Lubonja was released in 1991, after having spent seventeen years in prison and having suffered a nervous breakdown, while serving his sentence. He is an outspoken critic of the Albanian socio-political factors, i.e. right-wing leader Sali Berisha, Socialist Party leader Edi Rama, former KLA leader Ramush Haradinaj, Red and Black Alliance, and poet and novelist Ismail Kadare. He edits and publishes the literary magazine P√´rpjekja (Endeavour) in Tirana, which was founded by him in 1994.

History  Sapphire Energy was founded in 2007. As of February 2014, Sapphire Energy employed over 150 employees. The company is headquartered in San Diego, Calif., and has an engineering office in Orange County, Calif. and a Research and Development facility in Las Cruces, NM. In addition, the company's Green Crude Farm, the world's first commercial demonstration algae-to-energy facility (also known as the Integrated Algal BioRefinery or IABR), for which construction began in June 2011, is now operating in Luna Country, near Columbus, New Mexico. Sapphire's Green Crude Farm integrates the entire value chain of algae-based fuel, from cultivation, to harvest, to conversion of ready-to-refine Green Crude, representing the convergence of biotechnology, agriculture, and energy. The Farm is now producing barrels of crude oil year-round, and the company expects to be producing 100 barrels of Green Crude per day in 2015, and at commercial scale production in 2018. In March 2011, Sapphire Energy and Monsanto announced a multi-year collaboration on algae-based research projects. In May 2011, the company announced a multi-year agreement with The Linde Group to co- develop a low-cost system to deliver CO2 to commercial-scale, open-pond, algae-to-fuel cultivation systems, now underway at the Green Crude Farm. Later, in July 2013, the companies expanded their partnership with plans to refine and commercialize a new industrial scale hydrothermal treatment technology to upgrade algae biomass to crude oil that they intend to license and market to various industries, including algae, municipal solid waste, and farm waste, for converting other biomass sources into energy. In February 2012, Sapphire Energy announced that it will integrate Earthrise Nutritionals' spirulina strain into its growing inventory of cyanobacteria and algae strains to expand resources for algae-to-energy production. In November 2012, the company announced a partnership with Institute for Systems Biology to further the scientific research and development of algae biofuels. In 2013, Sapphire Energy expanded its partner network to include business agreements with industry leading oil & gas refiners. In March 2013, Sapphire Energy announced a commercial agreement with Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company, LLC. Per the agreement, Tesoro will purchase crude oil from Sapphire Energy's Green Crude Farm for processing into fuel at its west coast refineries. In December 2013, Sapphire Energy and Phillips 66 announced they will work together to analyze and confirm that Green Crude can be refined in traditional refineries, and that it meets all Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) certification requirements under the Clean Air Act. The companies will work to complete the EPA certification process to register a new fuel product entering the market. Seed financing to launch the company in 2007 was provided by ARCH Ventures and Larry Bock. In 2008, Sapphire Energy announced it had raised more than $100 million in a Series B funding round which included ARCH Venture Partners, Wellcome Trust, Venrock and Cascade Investment, LLC. In April 2012, the company announced it had secured $144 million in Series C investment funding with backers including Arrowpoint Partners, Monsanto and other undisclosed investors, as well as all Series B investors. In December 2009, Sapphire Energy was awarded a $54.5 million USDA loan guarantee and a $50 million grant from the US Dept. of Energy as part of President Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the USDA's Biorefinery Assistance Program 9003, authorized through the 2008 Farm Bill. The $54.5 million loan guarantee awarded through the Biorefinery Assistance Program was issued to build a fully integrated, algae-to-crude oil commercial demonstration facility in Columbus, N.M. In partnership with the USDA and the U.S. Department of Energy, Sapphire Energy developed and implemented its facility, known as the Green Crude Farm, on time and on budget. Today, the Farm is operational and producing renewable crude oil on a continuous basis. In 2013, Sapphire Energy announced that it had paid off of its entire loan guarantee to the USDA. Sapphire Energy's Green Crude biofuel has been featured in multiple pilot demonstrations since 2009. The company used Syntroleum Inc (SYNM) technology to provide fifty gallons of gasoline for the Algaeus, a plugin-hybrid Toyota Prius that drove across the United States in September 2009.Bigelow, Bruce V. (2009-09-08). \\"San Diego's Sapphire Energy Plans Bio-Refinery in New Mexico as 'Algaeus' Begins Promotional Cross-Country Tour\\". Xconomy. Retrieved 2009-09-10. The tour was conducted to show that gasoline made by algae is viable in today's vehicles, without modification. In 2009, Continental Airlines also tested one of Sapphire Energy's green crude blends.[7] Sapphire Energy provided Green Crude oil for the first flight's using algae derived jet fuel that was refined by UOP into jet fuel for two test flights ‚Äì Continental Airlines 737-800 and Japan Airlines 747-300. In 2012, the company provided its Green Crude diesel fuel to power Below the Surface's 'Driving Innovation' Racing Team, which established itself by setting the first official algae-fueled diesel motorcycle speed records through a series of race challenges in the United States and Mexico. Since 2008, Sapphire Energy has consistently ranked in the Biofuels Digest list of the hottest 50 companies in bioenergy. In early 2017, the company was acquired by a farmer for pennies on the dollar and its name is no longer associated with biofuels or algae.  Products  Sapphire Energy produces \\"Green Crude\\" from algae, creating a crude oil containing many of the properties found in fossil crude oil. Green Crude is a low carbon crude oil offering a reduction in carbon emissions compared to petroleum-based equivalents. Its production doesn't impact agricultural crops, land, or water, since algae are grown in salty, non-potable water, using lands not suitable for agriculture, and require only sunlight and CO2 to grow. It also drops right into the current infrastructure of today's cars, trucks, and aircraft without modifications. Sapphire Energy's Green Crude can be refined in a typical refinery. According to the company, \\"Green Crude\\" oil meets fuel quality standards, and is completely compatible with the existing petroleum infrastructure, from refinement through distribution to retail suppliers. Gasoline produced from the Green Crude achieved a 91 octane rating while meeting fuel quality standards. In August 2012, Sapphire Energy announced that its commercial demonstration algae-to-energy facility, the Green Crude Farm, is up and running with the on-time and on budget completion of Phase 1 construction, which began June 2011. The Farm consists of 100 acres of 1.1 acre and 2.2 acre ponds, as well as all the mechanical and processing equipment needed to harvest and extract algae and recycle water for the planned 300 acre facility. The Farm is now producing Green Crude oil year- round, and the company is in the process of refining its algae-to-energy processes and technologies as it moves towards scaling up production. The company expects the Green Crude Farm to produce 100 barrels a day of ready-to- refine crude oil at full operating capacity. In the September 2012 issue of Forbes magazine, Sapphire Energy expects its Green Crude to \\"be competitive with petroleum by 2018 if it can produce a minimum of 5,000 barrels a day\\".Douglass, Elizabeth (2008-05-29). \\"Sapphire Energy turns algae into 'green crude' for fuel - Los Angeles Times\\". http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/29/business/fi-greencrude29.

Its population in 2007 was 54,448 in a total area of 2,195 km¬≤. 400px V√°rzea da Palma is located east of the S√£o Francisco River and is on the Rio das Velhas, a tributary of the S√£o Francisco. It is 37 km. southeast of Pirapora, the most important city of the region. A railroad line, now only freight, runs through the city. Neighboring municipalities are Pirapora and Lassance. The former village of Palma Velha was a cluster of huts that served as a campsite for muleteers coming from different regions, on their way to Curvelo. With the building of the railroad Estrada de Ferro Central do Brasil, in 1910, the village changed its name to V√°rzea da Palma. Around the central station settlers began to make their houses attracted by commerce and the movement of the new railroad line. Cust√≥dio Fernandes Sampaio, considered the founder of the city, was responsible for donating part of his lands for the building of the first church. In 1948, V√°rzea da Palma was elevated to the category of district and in 1953 it became a municipality.Varzea da Palma informa√ß√µes The main economic activities are cattle raising for meat production, metal industry, and farming.

History  In 1923, the Camberwell City Council acquired the land on which the park stands today. In its early years, the parkland was known as Myrtle Park. The North Balwyn Cricket Club was established in 1927, followed by the North Balwyn Baseball Club in 1937. During the post-war housing boom in Melbourne during the 1950s, the park became increasingly used by the increase in population, including by travelling circuses, and the original sporting pavilion was opened in 1962 and rebuilt in 2007.  Access  Map of the parklands. Cars enter the park from one of two separate entrances, either from Belmore Road directly or from Gildan Street. There is no through access between the carparks. Belmore Road features frequent bus services, with both the 302 and 304 routes servicing the park at two stops. A path, crossing Buchanan Avenue to the east, links Macleay Park with Hislop Park through the North Balwyn Tennis Club. There is also pedestrian access from Severn Street in the west, Balwyn High School and Cobham Street to the north, Buchanan Avenue in the east and Belmore Road from the south.

Biographical background Winwood was born in Portland, Oregon to Robert Ivan Winwood and Edna Pauline Enz. He attended Portland State University and Seattle City University. Winwood was raised as a Protestant, though skeptical of organized religions. He was given a copy of the Book of Mormon when he was around twenty-five and a married father of two. This led to his conversion and 1971 baptism into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Portland, Oregon. Shortly afterward, his new faith was shaken by the anti-Mormon book Who Really Wrote the Book of Mormon?. This led to his investigation of anti-Mormonism and involvement in Mormon apologetics. In the 1990s he published a book and video defending the LDS Church against critics. Winwood is married to Judith Annette Rigas and they have four children. They currently reside in Cottonwood Heights, Utah.

The Belgian-born actress Audrey Hepburn portrayed Gabrielle van der Mal in the 1959 Fred Zinnemann film The Nun's Story, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress.  Life  Habets was born in West Flanders in January 1905. In 1926, she entered the Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary, an enclosed religious order which cared for the sick and poor within their cloister. She was admitted to their convent on Molenaarstraat in Ghent, and then took the religious name Sister Xaverine. In 1933, she was sent to the mission hospital her congregation staffed for the Belgian government in the Belgian Congo. She returned to Belgium in the summer of 1939 due to her having contracted tuberculosis, shortly before the start of World War II and the subsequent German invasion of Belgium. Her father was killed shortly after this, causing Sister Xaverine to develop such a hatred toward the Germans that she became involved with the Belgian Resistance. She came to feel that she could not obey the dictates of her faith for forgiveness and applied to the Holy See for a dispensation from her religious vows ‚Äì a very rare request in her day. She was eventually granted this, and left the congregation on 16 August 1944 from their convent in Uccle.Rhoenline.com \\"Marie Louise Habets\\" Habets settled in Antwerp, which was liberated by Allied forces a few weeks later. She joined a British First Aid unit which nursed the soldiers wounded while fighting in the Battle of the Bulge. She was present in Antwerp when German forces massively bombarded the city soon after its liberation, killing and maiming some ten thousand people. After the end of the war in Europe, she was sent to Germany to help care for her fellow Belgians who had been imprisoned in concentration camps there. Hulme's 1966 autobiography Undiscovered Country describes Hulme and Habets‚Äô first meeting in 1945. Both were volunteers with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), an international project working to resettle refugees and others displaced by the war. Hulme recounts that, at a training camp in northern France, she became aware of a Belgian woman who spent most of her time asleep. Even when awake, the woman, a nurse, was taciturn, solitary and preoccupied, almost asocial. In time, however, the Belgian nurse revealed herself as a diligent worker, a good friend, and a woman with a secret: she had just left the convent after 17 years of struggle with her vows. She felt burdened and depressed by a deep sense of failure. Zoe Fairbairns‚Äô article The Nun‚Äôs True Story and Fairbairns‚Äô radio play The Belgian Nurse aired by the British Broadcasting Corporation in 2007, both tell the story of how Habets's story became Hulme's bestseller and how the two women became friends, sharing a home for nearly 40 years.The Tablet, Jan 6 2007, \\"The Nun's True Story\\", Zoe FairbairnsBBC Radio Four,The Belgian Nurse, Zoe Fairbairns Jan 13 2007 Their parallel lives are explored in The Nun and the Crocodile: The Stories within The Nun's Story, a paper given by Debra Campbell at the Women and Religion section of the American Academy of Religion Annual Meeting on November 21, 2004. Hulme papers Documents relating to Habets can be found among the Kathryn Hulme papers which are held at the Beinecke Library at Yale University in the United States.Kathryn Hulme Papers. Yale Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. These include a report by Habets about a repatriation transport from the displaced persons resettlement camp at Wildflecken, Bavaria, which set off for Poland on April 30, 1946. The report is written in English, which Habets did not speak fluently at the time; it was probably translated by Hulme. Read in conjunction with Chapter 14 of Undiscovered Country, it shows the high value placed by Hulme, an American who had not lived under enemy occupation, on the first-hand knowledge, experience and powers of observation of her Belgian colleague. There is also a report by Habets on caring for tuberculosis patients at Wildflecken. Later life In late 1948 Habets had been promoted to Area Chief Nurse by the International Refugee Organization of the United Nations. After continuing to help displaced persons for the next several years, she decided that she had no desire to live in her homeland again, and requested an American visa. Hulme was her sponsor in this, and the visa was granted. After one last visit with her family, Habets and Hulme sailed from Antwerp to the United States on the SS Noordam, arriving in New York City during February 1951. They initially settled in Arizona, where she worked as a nurse in a hospital serving the Navajo people. They later moved to California, where she nursed Audrey Hepburn after a horse-riding accident which occurred during her filming of The Unforgiven. In 1960, Hulme and Habets moved to the Hawaiian island of Kauai, where Hulme continued to write, with Habets's support and assistance. They grew tropical fruits, bred dogs, rode horses, had friends to stay, gave talks, and socialized among the other Kauai expats. They remained Catholics, and Hulme continued her involvement with the work of the mystic G. I. Gurdjieff. Habets did some nursing, though mainly on a private basis for friends. Hulme and Habets travelled widely, sometimes together, sometimes independently. Death and legacy Habets died in May 1986, five years after Hulme. Having inherited her literary estate, Habets, in her own will, shared it out among members of her own family, members of Hulme's family, and six sisters, who cannot be traced. The resultant confusion makes it unclear who owns the rights, and who can give permissions. This is probably why The Nun‚Äôs Story, along with Hulme's other books, remains out of print.

During his playing spell at Hajduk he was nicknamed \\"Pere, splitski Pele\\" which meant \\"Pete, the Pel√© from Split\\". Playing career HNK ≈†ibenik Petar Nadoveza started his youth and senior career at HNK ≈†ibenik. In ≈†ibenik's youth academy he was under the guidance of Stojan Mileta who created a lot of talented footballers from that region. At that time Slavko Lu≈°tica was the manager of ≈†ibenik and with him ≈†ibenik was a fierce club in the Yugoslav Second League. HNK Hajduk Split In 1963 he moved to Hajduk Split where he would spend the next 10 years of his career. He was a real \\"killer\\" on the field. He had amazing speed and a real instinct for the goal. Nadoveza wasn't a very disciplined player which resulted in many arguments with his managers, especially with Branko Zebec but on the pitch he showed his commitment to the club and to the game. He was loved by the fans and the club personnel. His famous incident was in 1964 when he assaulted a football referee called Strmƒçeg. This resulted in a 6-month ban from playing football. During the 1960s Hajduk wasn't doing so well in the Yugoslav First League and many times they were facing relegation to the second league. In the 1965‚Äì66 Yugoslav First League Hajduk was accused of match fixing and was facing relegation. The match fixing case was dropped but Hajduk was still facing relegation in the league. Thanks to Nadoveza who scored 21 goals that season Hajduk was saved and managed to stay in the first league. Nadoveza became the Top goalscorer that season. In 1967, he helped Hajduk win their first Yugoslav Cup. He played in the 1967‚Äì68 European Cup Winners' Cup which was Hajduk's first real participation in a UEFA competition. At the end of the 1960s many young talented players such as Jerkoviƒá, D≈æoni and Mu≈æiniƒá joined the club and alongside the \\"old guard\\" with Nadoveza they managed to create a new Hajduk. Their first success was the 1970‚Äì71 Yugoslav First League which they won dramatically. The most famous game that season was against FK Partizan in Belgrade where Hajduk needed 2 points to secure the trophy. Hajduk was losing 0‚Äì3 but in the second halftime Nadoveza managed to score two goals and motivate his team to turn the result around. Hajduk won the game 4‚Äì3 and secured the championship. Nadoveza also became the top goalscorer that season with 20 goals. Nadoveza won his second Yugoslav Cup in 1972. In his last season for the club he won his third Yugoslav Cup and helped Hajduk reach the 1972‚Äì73 European Cup Winners' Cup semi-final where they lost to Leeds United. In 1973 after 10 years playing for Hajduk he left the club and went to Lokeren. Nadoveza made 460 appearances for Hajduk in which he scored 296 goals which makes him the 5th best goalscorer in Hajduk history. He retired in 1975. Managerial career He started his managerial career at Hajduk Split in 1982. During his 2-year spell as manager there he won the Yugoslav Cup in 1984, finished 2nd in the 1982‚Äì83 Yugoslav First League and made his way to the 1983‚Äì84 UEFA Cup semi-final where he was kicked out by Tottenham after a 2‚Äì2 aggregate. In 1996, he won the Slovenian Cup with Olimpija. In 2000 after taking the Hajduk seat for the 3rd time he won the Croatian Cup where he defeated Hajduk's biggest rivals Dinamo Zagreb. In 2003, he went to the HNK Hajduk Split Academy where he worked with youngsters. In 2004, he replaced Zoran Vuliƒá on the Hajduk seat 3 rounds before the end of the season. He managed to secure stability and moral in the team and so he won the 2003‚Äì04 Prva HNL. In July 2004 he became the Hajduk Academy director. In 2006, he also worked as the sporting director at Hajduk.

Perception in this case is achieved through the active exploration of surfaces and objects by a moving subject, as opposed to passive contact by a static subject during tactile perception.Weber, E. H. (1851). Die Lehre vom Tastsinne und Gemeingef√ºhle auf Versuche gegr√ºndet. Friedrich Vieweg und Sohn.  History  The term Haptik was coined by the German Psychologist Max Dessoir in 1892, when suggesting a name for academic research into the sense of touch in the style of that in \\"acoustics\\" and \\"optics\\".Dessoir, M. (1892). √úber den Hautsinn. Arch. f. Anat. u. Physiol., Physiol. Abt., 175‚Äì339.Grunwald, M. & John, M. (2008). German pioneers of research into human haptic perception. In M. Grunwald (Ed.), Human Haptic Perception (pp. 15-39). Basel, Boston, Berlin: Birkh√§user. Gibson (1966) defined the haptic system as \\"[t]he sensibility of the individual to the world adjacent to his body by use of his body\\". Gibson and others further emphasized what Weber had realized in 1851: the close link between haptic perception and body movement, and that haptic perception is active exploration. The concept of haptic perception is related to the concept of extended physiological proprioception, according to which when a tool such as a stick is used, perceptual experience is transparently transferred to the end of the tool. Haptic perception relies on the forces experienced during touch. This research allows the creation of \\"virtual\\", illusory haptic shapes with different perceived qualities,\\"The Cutting edge of haptics\\" which has clear application in haptic technology.Robles-De-La-Torre G. Principles of Haptic Perception in Virtual Environments. In Grunwald M (Ed.), Human Haptic Perception, Birkh√§user Verlag, 2008.  Exploratory procedures  People can rapidly and accurately identify three-dimensional objects by touch. They do so through the use of exploratory procedures, such as moving the fingers over the outer surface of the object or holding the entire object in the hand. The following exploratory procedures have been identified so far: #Lateral motion #Pressure #Enclosure #Contour following Thus gathered object or subject properties are size, weight, contour, surface and material characteristics, consistency and temperature.  Perceptual deadband Perceptual deadband is a region which captures perceptual limitations of human perception. The Weber fraction and the level crossings constant are employed to define the perceptual deadband for haptic force stimulus. The deadband has an important application in designing perceptually adaptive sampling mechanisms for haptic data compression , which is required for transmitting haptic data over a communication network. There are many factors which affect the possible shapes of the perceptual deadband, for example: # Rate of change of force stimulus: The Weber fraction or level crossings constant decrease for a faster change in the force stimulus. # Temporal resolution: It is defined as the minimum time spacing required in perceiving two consecutive force samples. # Directional sensitivity: The study claims that the Weber fraction is a function of only the force magnitude, not the direction. # Task being performed: discriminative or comparative A user is more sensitive while doing a comparative task than a discriminative task. It is because one has to perceive changes only along one direction under the comparative task. All this signifies that the perceptual deadband is a function of the task to be carried out.  Impairments of haptic sensitivity  Haptic sensitivity can be impaired by a multitude of diseases and disorders, predominantly relating to skin injuries (incisions, burns, etc) and nerve lesions (through injury or impaired circulation). Additionally, loss of sensitivity (neuropathy) may be caused by metabolic, toxic and/or immunologic factors. Examples of medical conditions that can cause neuropathies are diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, thyroid dysfunction (hyper- and hypothyroidism) as well as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and alcohol dependency. Exo-Skin Soft Haptic exoskeletal interface Loss of the sense of touch is a catastrophic deficit that can impair walking and other skilled actions such as holding objects or using tools.  Haptic therapy  Immersive environments can recreate the feeling of haptic interaction. Exoskeletal gloves such as the Exo-Skin Soft Haptic exoskeletal interface, developed at Drexel University, can be programmed to take a patient through a program of physical therapy exercises to retrain muscles and senses.

A Marian exile, he was one of the Geneva Bible translators. On his return to England, he had trouble with conformity to the Anglican practices. With Laurence Humphrey, he played a leading part in the vestments controversy, a division along religious party lines in the early years of the reign of Elizabeth I of England. Life He was said to have been born at Playford, Suffolk, but possibly came from Binfield in Berkshire.Alec Ryrie, ‚ÄòSampson, Thomas (c.1517‚Äì1589)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 25 Feb 2011 He was educated at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge. In 1547 he joined the Inner Temple. He married a niece of Hugh Latimer;Brook, p. 375; Latimer and Sampson influenced the conversion of John Bradford, a Marian Protestant martyr.Townships - Blackley  British History Online He has been described as perhaps the most eloquent of all the new generation of evangelical preachers.John Foxe's Book of Martyrs After Sampson's conversion to Protestantism in 1551, he became rector of All Hallows, Bread Street, London.John Foxe's Book of Martyrs When the dean of Chichester, Bartholomew Traheron, resigned in December 1552, he recommended Sampson to succeed him, calling him a preacher ‚Ä¶ of such integrity as I would be glad to see placed here and he was duly preferred to the post the following February. However Sampson was never installed: Mary Tudor's accession intervened. His arrest was ordered as early as August 1553, however, he did not move out of the country until May 1554 when he went to Strasburg. His successor as rector at All Hallows, Laurence Saunders, was burned at the stake. Sampson was strongly anti-Catholic through the rest of his life.Claire Cross, The Puritan Earl (1966), p. 38. He communicated to his parishioners his distaste for Catholic prayers for the dead.Peter Marshall, Beliefs and the Dead in Reformation England (2002), p. 113. Elizabethan era He did not return immediately upon Elizabeth's accession, waiting until 1560.History of Our English Bible In that year he became canon of Durham, and in 1561 Dean of Christ Church, Oxford. In the controversy over clerical dress, Matthew Parker ordered the Anglican clergy to wear surplice and caps. Sampson attempted to give the debate a broader Protestant dimension, involving correspondence with Heinrich Bullinger. He was ultimately unsuccessful, since Bullinger sided with Parker.David Englander (editor), Culture and Belief in Europe, 1450-1600: An Anthology of Sources (1990), from p. 448. The Court of High Commission ruled against Sampson, after summoning him in 1565.Cross, p. 33. He was deprived of his position as Dean, despite being thought a very effective administrator.Patrick Collinson, Elizabethan Essays (1994), p. 73 note. He subsequently held other positions. He was prebendary of St Paul's Cathedral in 1570. He became Master of Whittington College. The old College of St. Spirit and St. Mary and almshouse set up by Richard Whittington at St. Michael Paternoster Royal had been shut down, first by Edward VI and then for good by Elizabeth,Colleges - Whittington's College  British History Online but he lectured there regularly. The spectacular case of Peter Birchet, who wounded John Hawkins in 1573, mistaking him for Christopher Hatton, brought attention to Sampson, since Birchet had heard him preach on the morning of the attack.Alexandra Walsham, Frantick Hacket: Prophecy, Sorcery, Insanity, and the Elizabethan Puritan Movement.

He was then appointed Master of the Hospital of William de Wygston, at Leicester.Joan Simon, Education and Society in Tudor England (1979), p. 324. Sampson continued to argue his position. He prepared a summary of Martin Bucer's De Regno Christi, which he passed to Lord Burghley during the 1570s. He died in Leicester in 1589, and was buried in St. Ursula's Chapel, attached to the Hospital, where his sons erected a memorial to him.Basil Hall, Martin Bucer in England, in David F. Wright, Martin Bucer: Reforming Church and Community (1994), p. 158. He had two sons, John and Nathaniel, and a daughter Johanna.

Some modern scholars consider the goddess to have been an innovation of the post- medieval period. Attestations The earliest record of a goddess named Zisa or Cisa is in the an eleventh-century manuscript, now in Vienna, titled Excerptum ex Gallia Historia (Excerpt from the History of Gaul). According to the Excerptum, the city of Augsburg was once known as Cisaris after this goddess, who saved the city from a Roman invasion on 28 September. On this day her feast was celebrated, and her name is preserved as the name of a hill, Cisunberc. A placename Cisenberg is attested around Augsburg in a charter from around 1300. The historical event described (the Roman assault) is universally rejected as not having any historical value. Various later textual mentions of Zisa all seem to depend on the Excerptum, sometimes mixed with information on Slavic deities derived from William of Malmesbury. In the late fifteenth and in the sixteenth century, German humanists associated the images of various women around Augsburg with the goddess, including some on churches and some dug up in the city. Theories Jacob Grimm proposed that Zisa might be the consort of the God Tyr (in Old High German, Ziu). Grimm also suggested a connection between Zisa and the \\"Isis\\" of the Suebi attested by Tacitus in his 1st century CE work Germania based on the similarity of their names. Grimm's connection of Zisa to Isis may have been influenced by similar considerations made by humanists such as Konrad Peutinger. The existence of a goddess Zisa was controversial through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In 1936, R. Kohl critically examined the evidence for the goddesses existence: he determined that none of the archaeological or pictoral depictions that were said to depict Zisa in fact depicted the goddess. Examining the Excerptum, Kohl argued that the name of the goddess seemed to have been derived as an explanation for the place name Cisenberg, after which the \\"old name\\" for Augsburg, Cisaris, was invented by the writer of the Excerptum from Cisae ara (altar of Cisa in Latin). Kohl argues that the name Cisenberg can be explained without the goddess; alternative explanations are that it means \\"mountain on which siskins [German Zeisige] nest\\" or \\"mountain in the form of a breast\\" (German Zitze). As all other information on Zisa appears to derive from the Excerptum in one way or another, Kohl concludes that the goddess never existed. Following Kohl, Rudolf Simek writes: > (Cisa, Zisa) is supposedly the name of a Germanic goddess who, according to > a Latin historical text from the 11th century, was worshipped in Augsburg in > heathen times. While Grimm made extensive speculations about the identity of > this goddess, today the supposition of a goddess Cisa is rejected because > the source text does not stand up to critical examination.

In his satires he assails in acrid terms the hypocrisy prevailing in Tuscany in the last years of the Medici rule. Life His family being poor, he early became a teacher, becoming a professor of belles-lettres at Florence and Prato. He was already in Holy Orders. In 1681 he failed to obtain the chair of rhetoric in the University of Pisa, partly because of the jealousy of other clerics and partly because of the acrimony constantly shown by him in his words and acts. In 1685 he went to Rome and enjoyed the favour of Queen Christina of Sweden, until her death in 1689. Pope Innocent XII then gave him a canonry, and appointed him to a chair of rhetoric in one of the institutions of the city of Rome Works Following the models provided by the poems of Gabriello Chiabrera and Fulvio Testi, Menzini wrote his Pindaric \\"Canzoni eroiche e morali\\" (1674‚Äì80). These observe the Greek division - strophe, antistrophe, and deal with subjects that were also engaging the attention of the contemporary poet Filicaja, e.g., the freeing of Venice, the taking of Budapest. Some seventeen of his elegies treat of matters of various interest. The poem \\"Il Paradiso terrestre\\" is almost continuation of the \\"Mondo creato\\" of Tasso, Menzini's favourite poet. In the \\"Academia Turculana\\" in mingled prose and verse, he introduces leading spirits of the time, who discuss subjects of many sorts. The pastoral note was struck by him in his \\"Sonetti pastorali\\"; and in his \\"Canzonette anacreontiche\\" he produced a number of graceful little lyrics. As well as his satires, he lashes in his \\"Arte poetica\\" the artificiality and the uncouthness of the versifiers of his time.

It was made of between 13 and 30 folds of cotton fabric and covered the upper torso.  Background  During the French Campaign against Korea, 1866, the military of the Joseon Kingdom, at the time using matchlock muskets, experienced the superiority of Western rifles. As a result, Heungseon Daewongun, then acting leader of the Joseon Kingdom, ordered the development of bullet-proof armor. The vests were distributed to soldiers after its creation, and were used in battles fought on Ganghwa Island against United States Navy and Marine forces during the United States expedition to Korea in 1871.

It is about 6 miles north of town Wimborne Minster, and about 1 mile south of the village of Wimborne St Giles. Its most recognizable features are a ruined Norman church built within a neolithic henge monument. Knowlton Circles The henge enclosing Knowlton Church is only one of three henges (known as Knowlton Circles) and associated earthworks. However, Church Henge is the best preserved, and is maintained by English Heritage. Nearby is Great Barrow, the largest round barrow in Dorset. Aerial photographs reveal a large number of ploughed-out barrows in the immediate vicinity. Knowlton Church Knowlton Church is a ruined building of unknown dedication standing near the centre of Church Henge. The earliest parts of the building are the 12th-century chancel and nave and there are 15th and 18th century additions and alterations.KNOWLTON CHURCH, Pastscape, retrieved 12 November 2013 The church was in use in 1550, however lack of use led to calls to demolish it in 1659. But it saw a revival after this time, and a north aisle was built in 1730. Later in the 18th century the roof fell in and the church was abandoned. The church is a Grade II* listed building. The nearby Victorian-built Church of the Ascension at Woodlands has a 12th-century circular stone font originally from Knowlton Church. History of Knowlton Early Christian activity at Knowlton is indicated by a mid-to-late Anglo-Saxon inhumation cemetery which was discovered to the east of Church Henge in 1958.MONUMENT NO. 213814, Pastscape, retrieved 12 November 2013 Excavations located sixteen burials within chalk-cut graves, some aligned east-west. Knowlton is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086-87 as Chenoltone. Winfrith Newburgh, East or West Lulworth, \\"Wintreborne\\" and Knowlton were held by King William; they were previously held by King Edward. The Domesday Book also records two hides of the land of the Count of Mortain in Knowlton, named as Chenoltune in the book, held by Ansgar, which was held by √Üthelm√¶r in the time of King Edward. This land paid geld, was enough for one plough with one slave and one bordar, a mill paying 12s6d, and was worth 25s. The site of the ancient village of Knowlton (as opposed to the present day hamlet) is located 500 metres west of Knowlton Church along Lumber Lane at the banks of the River Allen.KNOWLTON, Pastscape, retrieved 12 November 2013 There is little to be seen on the ground, but aerial photos do show the village layout.

Julius Hans Weigel (29 May 1908, Vienna - 12 August 1991, Maria Enzersdorf) was an Austrian Jewish writer and a theater critic (till 1962). He lived in Vienna, except during the period between 1938 and 1945, when he lived in exile in Switzerland. He was a lifetime companion of the Austrian actress Elfriede Ott.  Biography  During the time before the Anschluss of Austria, i.e. the annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938, he worked at Viennese cabaret theaters. After his return from Switzerland, where he lived in exile (1938 - 1945), he wrote critical reviews about theater plays for the Austrian newspapers Kurier and Neues √ñsterreich. Jointly with Friedrich Torberg he was responsible for the boycott in Austrian theaters of Bertolt Brecht whom he rejected because of Brecht's communist convictions. Between 1951 and 1954, Hans Weigel edited the anthology Stimmen der Gegenwart (Voices from the Present), which fostered young writers. Today, his name is used by the Subsidy for Literature of Lower Austria. Weigel adapted comedies by Johann Nepomuk Nestroy and translated Moli√®re. He collaborated with the annual Nestroy Theater Festival on Burg Liechtenstein, whose art director is Elfriede Ott. In 1974 he published an essay,Cf. Die Leiden der jungen W√∂rter, 1974. which made him a well-known critic of the use of language.

Life Fr. Marijan ≈†unjiƒá was born in the village of Buƒçiƒái near Travnik, Ottoman Bosnia at the end of the 18th century. At baptism he was named Ivo (in Bosnian short for Ivan, i.e. John) by his parents. He learned the basics of literacy from them, and continued his education in the Franciscan monastery of Guƒça Gora and the Franciscan monastery in Fojnica. He spent his novitiate year in Fojnica (1813‚Äì1814), and then started his studies of philosophy and theology in Zagreb and Moh√°cs (1814‚Äì1821). Afterwards he studied oriental languages (Arabic, Turkish, and Persian) in Zagreb and Vienna. He spent eight months with the renowned polyglot cardinal Mezzofanti in Bologna, where he deepened and expanded his knowledge of the languages. ≈†unjiƒá hence became well known for his knowledge of numerous languages, including oriental ones. In addition to the above-mentioned languages, he also spoke Italian, German, French, Classical Greek and Latin, and quite a few Slavic languages. If we take into account his education, his broad views, scientific and cultural work, we can say with certainty that he was one of the most prominent figures in the history of the Franciscan Province of Bosna Srebrena, and not only in his lifetime. When he returned to Bosnia, he was at first engaged in pastoral work as a parish vicar in Kupres and Mokronoge near Duvno (1831), afterwards in Ora≈°je near Travnik (1832). In addition to pastoral work, he performed the function of Province secretary (1832), Provincial custodian (1835) and Provincial Minister (1845‚Äì1851). The last five years of his life he spent as bishop and the Apostolic Vicar in Bosnia (1855‚Äì1860). He was twice imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities (in 1827 and 1834), because he fought for the rights of the Catholic people and his Franciscan Province. During the conflict with Bishop Rafo Bari≈°iƒá, in 1843 he was, along with many other prominent Franciscans, sentenced to be expelled to Italy, but that decision, due to changed circumstances, was never realized. During that long-lasting conflict, he travelled twice to Rome (in 1834 and 1840) and once to Constantinople (in 1846, together with some other friars), fighting for the rights of the Province. In 1851 he submitted a plea to the Austrian Emperor Francis Joseph I, urging him to take concrete action for the improvement of the hard situation Bosnian Catholics and Franciscans were in. He was very active and successful in raising new churches and monasteries, as well as in opening public schools. He was the first one to suggest the idea of abstinent societies. In October 1854, Pope Pius IX named him the titular bishop of Panadena and Apostolic Vicar in Bosnia. He performed the duty until death. ≈†unjiƒá was a good Franciscan, an ardent priest, and an exemplary bishop. He was a man of supreme erudition, an expert for classical, European, and oriental languages. In conversation with the Pope, bishops, priests, the Emperor, the Sultan, the Vizier, or ordinary people he was always elegant and dignified, mild and pleasant, simple and humble. Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer said that ≈†unjiƒá \\"had been the greatest and most famous man Bosnia in recent times had\\". He died in Vienna, on 28 September 1860. He was buried in the church of the Guƒça Gora Monastery. His written legacy was burned in 1945, together with the monastery, for whose construction he was largely responsible. The esteem, respect, and love toward Bishop ≈†unjiƒá were once again expressed when people in great numbers attended the funeral. Entire Bosnia shed their tears for him. On his tombstone was inscribed that \\"he was the crown and pride of his brethren, and an everlasting glory of his entire folk\\".

They reach Pondicherry to do their Hotel Management course and their friend Abbas (Vijeesh), arranges the top floor of a house for them to stay. The house is owned by Sophy (Kalaranjini) and she stays there with her two daughters Kamala (Meera Jasmine) and Padma (Bhavana). Their friend Abbas finds them a suitable accommodation, they had to share a house as paying guests where a mother and her two daughters are staying. On the day of joining, all three introduced themselves and Padma on hearing Ashtamoorthy's name calls him a funny name \\"Kashtamoorthy\\". Deepu deeply falls in love with Kamala, but could not express it. Kunjunju and Ashtamoorthy too fall in love with her. However when Kunjunju started up his feelings for Kamala, she threatens him with a knife, not to molest her. But experienced Kunjunju ignored her. Deep dreamt of Kamala even in his thoughts. One day, Ashtamoorthy skips his work by pretending to be suffering from a Kidney Stone. Even though Kunjunju and Deepu knew that he was acting, Sophy allowed to take rest for a day. So Moorthy reached home and started flirting with Kamala in the absence of Kunjunju and Deepu. He pretended to be expert in making French food and when he was about to serve it to some French guests, Kunjunju and Deepu understood that Moorthy was trying to win the heart of Kamala. In order to avoid Moothy from this, Kunjunju and Deepu made him the Rakhi brother of Kamala. But Kunjunju and Deepu continued to win the heart of Kamala, but did not know about each other. One day Chandramathi (Poornima Anand), the owner of the area and her husband Suku (Lishoy) comes to their house. Chandramathi ordered them to immediately leave the house as they could not pay their rent. Suku is a naive man who has to follow Chandramathi and he cannot speak openly.

When the three reach the hospital, the see the heartbroken Kamala and Padma. That evening the merciless Chandramathi gave them a week more to stay over there. Abbas rebukes Chandramathi because of the pain of children after death of their mother. But as Kunjunju, Deepu and Moorthy could not tolerate seeing the sisters in sad faces, they comfort both and all go for a trip to refresh their lives. Then Philippose (Cochin Haneefa) comes to their house from Chennai to see their nieces and to take some of his valuable items like a dress which he had left there long before. But he gets thrown out by Kinjunju, Deepu and Moorthy for disturbing Padma and Kamala. Kunjunju could not control his feelings for Kamala and on trying to express it, Kamala accidentally fractures his leg which left him paralysed for two weeks. Kamala ordered Deepu and Moorthy to keep an eye on him as she thought it is not safe to leave a flirt like Kunjunju with a mature girl like Kamala. One day as Deepu and Moorthy had gone for work, Kunjunju goes to Kamala's house to express his love towards her. When Deepu calls Kunjunju he lies that he had not got up from bed where he was lying. But Kamala, who saw this as a chance to avoid Kunjunju, says to Deepu that Kunjunju was disturbing her. Suspicious, Deepu goes with Moorthy to Kamala's house to find that Kunjunju was behaving badly with Kamala. Enraged, Deepu beats Kunjunju nearly forgetting his condition. Kamala orders the three to leave the house in order to avoid a noise in their area. Disappointed, the trio leaves the house as a result. But Deepu did not go with Moorthy and Kunjunju and goes to Abbas's hpuse in a cycle rikshaw while Moorthy and Kunjunju takes a room in a hotel. Moorthy knew that Kunjunju is not a person like Kamala and Deepu thought and decides to bring them together. That night Kunjunju saw Deepu standing at a beach. When Deepu disclosed about his love to Kunjunju, he got shocked as he too loved Kamala madly. So Kunjunju decides to sacrifice his love for Deepu and the next day he tells Deepu to go jogging and express his love to Kamala. Deepu goes jogging and saw Kamala on his way. When Kamala gave him a flower said that she had no problem with them, Deepu finds out that it was actually Padma who came instead of Kamala as she had headache. On his way back he gives the flower to a small girl. When Padma reached home she purposefully rebuked Kunjunju calling him bad words in front of Kamala to test her love towards Kunjunju. Then she came to know that Kamala is actually in love with Kunjunju, not Deepu. When Kunjunju asked if Deepu had expressed his feelings to Kamala, Kunjunju said the truth, that Padma came instead of Kamala. In the evening while Kunjunju, Moorthy and Deepu were in a restaurant, Kunjunju receives a call from Padma that Kamala wants to meet him and express her feelings for him. However Kunjunju couldn't cheat Deepu and decides to go and see her. As a result both saw each other and when Kamala expressed her feelings to Kunjunju, he was in a joy at first but in a moment thinking Deepu, he stops Kamala and just said that he was just pretending his love to her. Kamala broke down in tears and goes away. When Moorthy asked Kunjunju why had he done this to make her pained, Kunjunju said that it was for Deepu he had done everything. However he still couldn't control his pain. Then he decides to forget her love forever. But as the time approached the three to leave Pondicherry, they including Kamala and Padma go for an outing for their last and final reunion. Padma told everyone to get separated happily instead of being in a sorrow. So they all started singing and dancing. However when Moorthy and Padma danced finally Padma accidentally falls from a huge rock and dies. This left Kamala in tears and she is now all alone. The next day Kunjunju, Moorthy and Deepu are in an arrangement to leave the place. Kunjunju uses his chance to unite Deepu and Kamala and tells him to call her back. But Kamala was not ready to leave her home. She gives her last bunch of flowers to Deepu and all three leave. Out of control, Kunjunju forcefully said Deepu to stop the car as Kamala is the girl he loved. Deepu who came to know by Moorthy that Kamala actually loved Kunjunju rebukes him and finally goes to call her. But on reaching there they were informed that Philippose had taken her to Kamathipura, his native place in Channai. So the three men rushed to Kamathipura in search of Philippose and on finding him all the three thrash him. Philippose takes them to Kamala whom he takes care of like his own daughter.

Hearts lost 2‚Äì0 to Dundee at Dens Park thanks to two goals by substitute Albert Kidd; the first in the 83rd minute and the second in the final minute while Celtic beat St Mirren 5‚Äì0 at Love Street. As a result, Celtic won the league on goal difference. Relegation was suspended due to league reconstruction, therefore Motherwell and Clydebank retained their Premier Division status.

While not considered a \\"major\\" part of the worldwide thrash metal scene due to distance from the major Bay Area and Teutonic scenes, Australian thrash metal has had a fairly substantial following in overseas markets, while local audiences have always been difficult to gather. Probably the most well-known Australian thrash bands from the 1980s would be Mortal Sin and Hobbs' Angel of Death.  History  1980s It is uncertain where or when the thrash metal scene in Australia began, but one of the earliest records of a band playing the style of music would be the Melbourne group Heresy in 1982, who would later change their name to Nothing Sacred. While the members of Nothing Sacred did not consider themselves a thrash metal group, the influences from the style were apparent, also blending influences from NWOBHM and, on their full-length album Let Us Prey hardcore punk, with a cover of an SOD song. Peter Hobbs, front-man from the Melbourne band Tyrus would later collaborate with the members of Nothing Sacred to record the early demos of what would later become Hobbs' Angel of Death. 1985 through to 1992 was the \\"peak\\" period of the Australian thrash metal scene, as local audiences with interest in the genre began to increase, and more bands would begin playing the style of music. Sydney's Mortal Sin began in 1985 by vocalist Mat Maurer and drummer Wayne Campbell out of the ashes of a traditional metal band called Wizzard. In 1986 the band recorded the demo Mayhemic Destruction. So impressed were the band with the recording's turnout, Mortal Sin decided to release Mayhemic Destruction as an album the following year to praising reviews, and helped them establish a healthy fanbase locally and overseas, eventuating in a national tour with Metallica in 1989 and an overseas tour with Testament and Faith No More in 1990. Sydney band Slaughter Lord were also impressing fans across the seas, but after only a release of one demo tape (titled Taste of Blood), the band disintegrated in 1987 after only one year of activity. Swedish band At the Gates would record a Slaughter Lord cover song (Legion) on their 1995 Slaughter of the Soul album. Another band, Addictive were also well known in the Sydney scene, releasing two albums and headlining a metal festival with Mot√∂rhead before ending in 1996. Melbourne's thrash scene was also on the rise in the 1980s, with bands like Renegade and Rampage recording albums. Hobbs' Angel of Death released their self-titled album in 1988 through German label Steamhammer/SPV Records. Possibly one of the heaviest Australian recordings of its time, Hobbs' Angel of Death showcased a very distinct, heavily Satanic, Slayer-influenced sound. While initially intended as a studio project, Hobbs' Angel of Death would play a few shows before ending at the turn of the decade, but would reform several times over the next few years.http://www.ausmetalguide.com/Hobbs%27_Angel_of_Death Hobbs' Angel of Death In other cities, interest in thrash metal was also on the rise, with Canberra band Armoured Angel and Alchemist's early demos showcasing distinct thrash metal sounds. Both bands would later evolve in their sounds later in their respective careers, with Armoured Angel transforming into a death metal group and Alchemist incorporating more psychedelic and progressive influences in their sound. Black Widow from Brisbane, who played an Alice Cooper and Mot√∂rhead influenced style of what they dubbed to be \\"black metal\\", would later change their line-up and reform under the name Iron Lightning, which showcased a melodic thrash sound similar to Megadeth. 1990s After the rise of grunge music and more groove metal styled bands like Machine Head and Pantera entering the fore, the Australian thrash metal scene soon imploded with most of the bands either breaking up, or re-inventing their musical style. Newer bands like Segression and Cryogenic would begin to gain notice in the mid-1990s incorporating these thrash-influenced groove metal sounds. However, more extreme acts incorporating elements of thrash metal mixed with elements of death metal and black metal were also on the rise during the late 1980s and early 1990s, the earliest of which being Sydney's Sadistik Exekution from Melbourne. Sadistik Exekution gained notoriety throughout the 1990s for their chaotic death metal style and nihilistic on-stage behaviour. Sadistik Exekution at Ausmetalguide Corpse Molestation would later transform into the black metal band Bestial Warlust. After Bestial Warlust came to an end, the former members would embark on their own projects ‚Äì Abominator, Gospel of the Horns, and Destr√∂yer 666. Destr√∂yer 666 and Gospel of the Horns would become the leading purveyors of the Australian blackened thrash movement. Australia's underground metal scene is probably best known for this movement today, with all of the bands finding healthy audiences overseas and locally in the heavy metal underground and some of the bands making frequent visits overseas, with Destr√∂yer 666 eventually moving to Europe in 2001.  2000s onward  Australian thrash metal, while still a very underground scene, still receives a fairly substantial following in local and overseas markets. In the 2000s, newer thrash metal bands have made their mark while older acts have reformed. Hobbs' Angel of Death and Mortal Sin made their comebacks in 2004 and 2003 respectively, with Hobbs' re-releasing their demos on a compilation album and performing at the Wacken Open Air Festival. Mortal Sin would release a new album in 2007, An Absence of Faith, before embarking on two more overseas tours. In recent years, thrash metal has had a steady rise in interest throughout most of Australia, with bands such as 4ARM taking the lead for most of the early 2000s, and as of the 2010s there has been multiple bands forming and playing their own style of thrash metal. On August 27, 2016 behold our first annual inside festival called 'ShredFest' featured Kaustic Attack, Deraign and Asylum.  Characteristics  Early Australian thrash metal bands in the 1980s incorporated significant American and Teutonic thrash influences in their sounds. Mortal Sin's Mayhemic Destruction album had very distinct influences from Metallica and Exodus, while Hobbs' Angel of Death showcased a heavier sound influenced by the likes of Venom and Slayer.

The Soringa whiting is known exclusively from the east coast of India, inhabiting shallow inshore environments, particularly sandy substrates. S. soringa was first described in 1982 by Dutt and Sujatha, with the taxonomic status of the species was questioned by Roland McKay in his review of the Sillaginidae, with similar features to S. asiatica suggesting it is a senior synonym of the latter. Taxonomy and naming The Soringa whiting is one of 29 species in the genus Sillago, which is one of three divisions of the smelt whiting family Sillaginidae. The smelt-whitings are Perciformes in the suborder Percoidea. The species was first scientifically described by S. Dutt and J. Sujatha in 1982 based on a specimen taken from the western Bay of Bengal (near the Indian city of Visakhapatnam), which was later designated to be the holotype. The specimen was accidentally caught whilst carrying out a taxonomic study on ladyfish in the region, with a minitrawler being used to sample the area. Whilst reviewing the Sillaginidae, Roland McKay was unable to examine the holotype, but concedes S. soringa is very similar to S. asiatica morphologically, and is probably synonymous. McKay described S. asiatica in 1983, while S. soringa was described in 1982, thus giving it preference and rendering S. asiatica a junior synonym. Without the holotype, however, McKay retained both species pending further detailed studies on the species. The species is commonly referred to as 'Soringa whiting', 'Soringa sillago' or simply 'Soringa', the name given to the fish on the Indian coast, and from which the specific name of the fish is derived. Description The smelt- whitings are all very similar in their body morphology and external anatomy, with the Soringa whiting no exception. The species has a slightly compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth, with a concave-up dorsal profile and a straight ventral profile. The maximum reported size for the Soringa whiting is 15 cm. The fin anatomy is highly useful for identification purposes, with the species having 11 spines in the first dorsal fin, with one spine and 21 soft rays on the second dorsal fin. The anal fin has two spines with 22 soft rays posterior to the spines. The pectoral fins have 15-16 soft rays while the ventral fin consists of a single spine and 5 soft rays. Lateral line scales and cheek scales are also distinctive, with Soringa whiting possessing 64 to 68 lateral line scales and cheek scales positioned in 2 rows, the upper cycloid and the lower ctenoid. The rest of the body is covered in ctenoid scales. The amount of vertebrae is also diagnostic, having 34 in total. The swimbladder is the major distinguishing feature, being lancolate with a single median finger like extensions and a pair of recurved anterior extensions each side. There is a single post coelomic extension, and a central blind tubular duct arising in on the ventral side of the swimbladder. The Soringa whiting is a gray brown on the dorsal and upper flanks, becoming paler laterally, while the lower flanks and ventral surface are a milky white. Small discrete black spots populate the anterior dorsal fin membrane, becoming more numerous toward the anterior half of the fin. The soft dorsal fin has a continuous grey band, running parallel to and close to the anterior edge of each ray. The membrane of the anal fin has similar black dots to the dorsal, but to a lesser extent. The pectoral fin and ventral fins are golden to hyaline while the caudal fin is hyaline with black dots. Distribution and habitat The Soringa whiting is currently only known from the east coast of India and thus only from a small area of the Indian Ocean. Is likely the range of the species may be greater than this however, due to confusion with S. asiatica and S. sihama, resulting in the small reported range. Soringa whiting, like most sillaginids is an inshore species and is known to inhabit sandy substrates at 5 to 30 m depth. Researchers studying digenean parasites on sillaginids have noted S. soringa, S. lutea and S. indica show seasonal migrations where the juveniles occur in shallow coastal waters during winter months and move offshore during summer. Nothing else is known of the species biology or ecology. Due to confusion with other species, its contribution to local fisheries is unknown, possibly being locally important.

Some of the most eminent players in the fields of Production, Reuse and Recycling of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE), government agencies and NGOs as well as UN Organisations count themselves among its members. StEP encourages the collaboration of all stakeholders connected with e-waste, emphasising a holistic, scientific yet applicable approach to the problem. History Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is increasing every day. The volume of WEEE is becoming a serious environmental problem that has yet to become recognised by the greater public. To guarantee the neutrality required to give analysis and recommendations the necessary credibility, StEP has been started. After a starting period of three years, initiated by the United Nations University UNU, promotion team wetzlar and Hewlett-Packard, the StEP Initiative had its official launch in March 2007. Aims and means ‚ÄúOne of the most important aims of the StEP Initiative is to elaborate a set of global guidelines for the treatment of e-waste and the promotion of sustainable material recycling‚Äù Press communiqu√© of the initiative The initiative comprises five cooperating task forces, each addressing specific aspects of e-waste, while covering the entire life-cycle of electric and electronic equipment. In all its activities, the initiative places emphasis on working with policy-making bodies to allow results from its research to impact current practices. StEP is being coordinated by the science and research body of the UN System, the United Nations University (UNU). The long-term goal of StEP ‚Äúis to develop ‚Äì based on scientific analysis ‚Äì a globally accepted standard for the refurbishment, recycling of e-waste. Herewith, StEP‚Äôs aim is to reduce dangers to humans and the environment, which result from inadequate and irresponsible treatment practices, and advance resource efficiency.‚Äù (Ruediger Kuehr, Executive Secretary of the StEP Initiative). To achieve this, StEP conceives and implements projects based on the results of multidisciplinary dialogues. The projects seek to develop sustainable solutions that reduce environmental risk and enhance development. Organization of the initiative The supreme body of the StEP Initiative is its general assembly, which decides its general direction and development. This general assembly is based on a memorandum of understanding, which is signed by all members and states the guiding principles of StEP. A Secretariat, hosted by the UNU in Bonn, is mandated with the accomplishment of the day-to-day managerial work of the initiative. A steering committee, composed of representatives from key stakeholders, monitors the progress of the initiative. The core work is accomplished by the five task forces (TF): ‚ÄúPolicy‚Äù, ‚ÄúReDesign‚Äù, ‚ÄúReUse‚Äù, ‚ÄúReCycle‚Äù and ‚ÄúCapacity Building‚Äù. These task forces conduct research and analysis in their respective domains and seek to implement innovative projects. TF 1 ‚Äì Policy: The aim of this task force is to assess and analyse current governmental approaches and regulations related to WEEE. Starting from this analysis, recommendations for future regulating activities shall be formulated. TF2 ‚Äì ReDesign: This task force works on the design of EEE, focusing on the reduction of negative consequences of electrical and electronic appliances throughout their entire life cycle. The task force especially takes heed of the situation in developing countries. TF3 ‚Äì ReUse: The focus of this task force lies in the development of sustainable, transmissible principles and standards for the reuse of EEE. TF4 ‚Äì ReCycle: The objective of this task force is to improve infrastructures, systems and technologies to realize a sustainable recycling on a global level. TF5 ‚Äì Capacity Building: The aim of this task force is to draw attention to the problems connected to WEEE. This aim shall be achieved by making the results of the research of the task forces and other stakeholders publicly available. In doing so, the task force relies on personal networks, the internet, collaborative working tools etc. Guiding Principles \\"1. StEP‚Äôs work is founded on scientific assessments and incorporates a comprehensive view of the social, environmental and economic aspects of e-waste. 2\\\\. StEP conducts research on the entire life-cycle of electronic and electrical equipment and their corresponding global supply, process and material flows. 3\\\\. StEP‚Äôs research and pilot projects are meant to contribute to the solution of e-waste problems. 4\\\\. StEP condemns all illegal activities related to e-waste including illegal shipments and reuse/ recycling practices that are harmful to the environment and human health. 5\\\\. StEP seeks to foster safe and eco/energy-efficient reuse and recycling practices around the globe in a socially responsible manner.\\" \\\\- Quote from the website: - See also *Computer recycling *Sustainable Electronics Initiative (SEI) External links *StEP Website *Article by BBC News Online Category:Electronic waste ","title":"Solving the E-waste Problem"},{"id":"17730671","text":"An animal tale or beast fable generally consists of a short story or poem in which animals talk. It is a traditional form of allegorical writing.M. H. Abrams, A Glossary of Literary Terms (5th edition 1985), p. 6. Important traditions in beast fables are represented by the Panchatantra and Kalila and Dimna (Sanskrit and Arabic originals), Aesop (Greek original), One Thousand and One Nights (Arabian Nights) and separate trickster traditions (West African and Native American). The medieval French cycle of allegories, Roman de Reynart is called a beast-epic, with the recurring figure Reynard the fox.H. J. Blackham, The Fable as Literature (1985), p. 40. Beast fables are typically transmitted freely between languages, and often assume pedagogic roles: for example, Latin versions of Aesop were standard as elementary textbook material in the European Middle Ages, and the Uncle Remus stories brought trickster tales into English. A more recent example, in English literature, was George Orwell's allegorical novel Animal Farm, in which various political ideologies were personified as animals, such as the Stalinist Napoleon Pig, and the numerous \\"sheep\\" that followed his directions without question.{{cite newslast1=Nugrahanifirst1=Novanititle=Zootopia: A modern-day fable that will delight young and old alikeurl=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/02/19/zootopia-a-modern-day- fable-will-delight-young-and-old-alike.htmlaccessdate=6 March 2016publisher=Jakarta Postdate=19 February ivdea delenda est } Notes Further reading *Jill Mann, From Aesop to Reynard: Beast Literature in Medieval Britain.

History  Established on January 27, 2003, at its headquarters, Shanghai, the company developed Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO) and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) solutions via applying security practices, structured global sourcing methodologies based on the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI). The company initially traded as ‚ÄúSheng-feng Co., Ltd.‚Äù with a registered capital of 4.5 million US dollars and rapidly grew to become one of China's leading IT service companies. As of Dec 2007, the company sat on a US$17.92 million revenue base (from US$1.75 million in 2003), had won several exceptional quality awards within China, for ITO leadership, had 8 offices globally (6 in strategic locations within China), and plans to open a U.S office in 2009. The company also reported an 89% CAGR cumulative growth since its founding in 2003, had matured in its Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI Level 3), and had been initiating steps to attain Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI Level 5) certification. It is best known in China for its unique organization logo story, its rapid organizational growth (which started from just 15 employees), and locally known as the ‚ÄòChina‚Äôs youth IT dreams company‚Äô is its built upon the entrepreneurship spirit. On 28 July 2008, due to business development growth and to better serve international markets, once known as SSG (Safesoft Global), the company was re-branded to Seioglobal.

In doing so, the organization foresaw the need for rapid organizational growth in order to survive the on coming competitive times. During these times, the company was heavily driven by the entrepreneurship spirit. However, it was not satisfied and reorganized the company via its Japanese roots to diversify it and focused on intensifying independent innovations within Shanghai‚Äôs surrounding 2nd tier cities such as Wuxi and Jiaxing. Upgrading for competition For developing and attracting software development, information services to China‚Äôs developing metropolitan cities, the company quickly adhered to the nation‚Äôs ‚ÄúEleventh Five-Year Plan.\\" Such actions were to shape the strategy for the company for its coming challenging years. and in 2003, the company invested in several strategic 2nd tier metropolitan cities in China and opened up offices in Tokyo and Osaka in Japan.

It comprised three main branches: The Army (Landstreitkr√§fte), the Navy (Kriegsmarine) and the Aviation Troops (Luftfahrtruppen). The Army in turn consisted of its own three branches: The Common Army (Gemeinsame Armee), the Imperial-Royal Landwehr (kaiserlich- k√∂nigliche Landwehr) and the Royal Hungarian Honv√©d (k√∂niglich ungarische Landwehr). Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces was the Emperor-King, the professional leader was the Chief of the General Staff and the head of the joint Ministry for military affairs was the Minister of War. The Armed Forces served as one of the Empire's core unifying institutions and the principal instrument for the national defense as well as external power projection. The history of the Austro-Hungarian military begins when the Habsburgs established hereditary rule over Austrian lands in the 13th century and stretches until the fall of the Habsburgs, at the end of World War I, during which time their armies were among the largest and most significant in Europe. Though not as powerful as some of its contemporaries, the military of Austria-Hungary's scale, resources, organization, technology and training were one of the central factors determining conferral of 'great power' status on the empire for much of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Administration and organization The Military of Austria-Hungary was divided primarily into three primary service branches, with the navy sitting entirely independently of the other two, which to one extent or the other remained interlinked for the duration of their existence but all three of which fell within the ultimate remit of the Minister for War: * Austro-Hungarian Army * Austro- Hungarian Navy * Austro-Hungarian Air Service The war ministry itself served as one of the few 'common' ministries with jurisdiction throughout the Empire and over which the Imperial, as opposed to Austrian or Hungarian governments had local control. Command over large 'home' forces ‚Äì the Landwehr units, which served functions analogous to National Guard forces in the United States were however controlled by local Ministries of Defence in both Austria and Hungary. Within the War Ministry, the Navy enjoyed considerable autonomy through the Naval Section with its own staff and headquarters, while the Ministry itself concentrated more on quarter master and administrative functions that close operational control of its respective services. While nominal, the umbrella organisation managing the Empire's Military capabilities, the War Ministry was not responsible for not only large state militia forces during peacetime but also an array of organisations such as the Evidenzbureau, who's remit fell within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The organisation of units and forces among a plethora of different commands and bodies had the effect of instilling a number of organisational cultures, diffusing responsibility, creating competition between agencies, failing to develop inter-organisational efficiencies and meaning that no one body had overall control of all military forces below the Emperor in preparing for war. Below the Minister for War, separate staffs and commanders-in-chief oversaw the training, planning, and operations responsibilities of their respective service branches. In terms of the Army, by 1914 it was divided among 16 Military Districts and comprising 325,000 active troops at all levels as well as 40,000 Austrian Landwehr and 30,000 troops of the Hungarian Honved. The Austro-Hungarian Navy maintained a number of naval facilities in the Adriatic, most importantly that at Pola, and possessed some 3 modern dreadnought class battleships in 1914 as well as 3 modern pre-dreadnoughts and 9 older battleships and a range of other craft including cruisers, destroyers and submarines in various states of combat readiness. The Austro-Hungarian air force remained embryonic in 1914 with a few German built planes having been added to the Army balloon service in 1913, but was to see marked expansion during the early years of the war. History and operations Origins The Austro-Hungarian military was a direct descendant of the military forces of the Habsburg sections Holy Roman Empire from the 13th century and the successor state that was the Austrian Empire from 1804. For 200 years, Habsburg or Austrian forces had formed a main opposing military force to a repeated Ottoman campaigns in Europe, with the Ottoman forces being stopped in battles around Vienna, which was besieged twice, in 1529 and again in 1683. Count Ernst R√ºdiger von Starhemberg, commanding troops in the city, broke the siege in 1683 with the aid of German and Polish forces under the King of Poland, Jan Sobieski, and pushed the besieging Ottoman armies toward the Balkans, ending its further engagements in Central Europe. Prince Eugene of Savoy, after a brief raid into Ottoman-held Bosnia, culminating in the sack of Sarajevo in 1697, returned to Vienna in November to a triumphal reception. In coordination with the Duke of Marlborough, Savoyard prince won a series of victories over Louis XIV of France in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì14). Wars fought with the Prussia of Frederick the Great over Silesia in 1740‚Äì48 (the War of the Austrian Succession) and 1756‚Äì63 were less successful. The monarchy's military potential during the eighteenth century was limited by the emperor's dependence on provincial Diets for recruits and tax receipts while the nobles of the imperial lands who controlled the enserfed peasantry had no fixed obligation to provide soldiers to the Habsburg. Austria was prominent in the coalitions that tried to contain Napoleon but was defeated in 1800, again in 1805 when Napoleon occupied Vienna after the Battle of Austerlitz, and finally after the Battle of Wagram in 1809. Austria still joined the final campaign resulting in Napoleon's defeat in 1814. Armies displayed their loyalty to the monarchy in 1848 and 1849, suppressing the revolutionary regimes that had swept into power in Vienna, Budapest, Milan, and Prague. In 1859 Austria was provoked into war with Piedmont and its supporter, the France of Napoleon III. The Austro-Piedmontese War lasted only three months, but both sides mobilized large armies. The Austrians were defeated after bitter fighting at Magenta and Solferino, the young Emperor Franz Joseph assuming personal command during the Battle of Solferino. Prussia established its domination over other German states by its victory over Austria in the Seven Weeks' War in 1866. The critical battle was waged at K√∂niggr√§tz (Hradec Kr√°lov√© in the present-day Czech Republic). The Austrians armed with muzzle-loading rifles sustained 20,000 casualties and 20,000 prisoners. The battle overshadowed Austria's victories over Prussia's Italian allies at Custoza and in the naval Battle of Lissa (Vis) off the Dalmatian coast in which a smaller Austrian fleet of ironclads overcame the Italians by ramming them. Following the end of the Seven Weeks' War, Austria experienced fifty years of peace until World War I broke out in 1914. 1867‚Äì1914 The creation of Austria-Hungary under the Compromise (Ausgleich) of 1867 separated the Empire into independent Austrian and Hungarian governments. Only the army, foreign affairs, and related budgetary matters remained with the emperor, who held supreme command of all forces in time of war. A new army law decreed universal three-year conscription followed by a ten-year reserve obligation. In practice, only about one in five of those liable to service were called up, and many were sent on leave after two years. The army of Austria-Hungary has been described as a state within a state. In an empire of ten nationalities and five religions, marked by ethnic conflict and sharp political and economic divisions, the army formed the only real bond among the emperor's subjects and the sole instrument through which loyalty to him could find expression. Nevertheless, Austria-Hungary gave the impression of being a highly militarized nation. According to British historian Edward Crankshaw who noted that not only the emperor but most males in high society never wore civilian clothes except when hunting. Select regiments of the army were splendidly outfitted, but, with a few dedicated exceptions, the officers, so magnificent on the parade ground, \\"shrank ... from the arbitrament of arms as from an unholy abyss\\". In reality, Austro-Hungarian military spending remained the lowest among the Great Powers. More of its GDP went to wine, beer and tobacco than to the armed forces. Regiments were organized along linguistic lines, although German was the language of command. Ethnic factors did not prevent recruitment of non-German speakers to the officer corps or their regular promotion. Hungarians, Croats, Serbs, Poles, Italians, Czechs, Slovenes, and Romanians could be found in senior positions. In the more prestigious units, most field-grade officers owed their ranks to birth or wealth. In 1900, a majority of the officer corps in the Austro-Hungarian army were native German speakers, although only one-fourth of the empire's total population was German speaking. During the late 19th and early 20th century leading up to World War One, the Austro-Hungarian Military underwent a process of modernisation in all service branches in terms of training, equipment and doctrine, although many traditions and old practices remained in force. As a result of the efforts chief-of-staff Montecuccoli and heir to the throne Franz Ferdinand the navy underwent considerable modernisation with the commission of a number of new units, and specifically three up-to-date battleships delivered by 1914. The army too underwent gradual and constant modernisation but maintained an unhealthy commitment to fortress-warfare as evidenced by concentration on giant artillery pieces and fortification building along the empire's eastern frontier. Although sometimes dismissed as fanciful and lacking touch with the realities confronting the forces at his disposal, as a chief of General Staff Conrad had ensured the army had remained vigilant and planning for war was at an advanced stage by 1914, although it has been argued that reorganisation and redeployment should have been sweeping in the aftermath of the Redl affair. During the period of 1867‚Äì1914, Austro-Hungarian forces were stationed on a number of national and international assignments. Although the empire exhibited no colonial aspirations, forays abroad including the military occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Novi Pazar, the expedition to Crete and involvement in the Boxer Rebellion. 1914‚Äì1918 At the start of the war, the army was divided in two, the smaller part attacked Serbia while the larger part fought against the massive Russian army. The 1914 invasion of Serbia was a disaster. By the end of the year the Austro-Hungarian Army had taken no territory and had lost 227,000 men (out of a total force of 450,000 men); see Serbian Campaign (World War I). On the Eastern front, things started out equally badly. The Austro-Hungarian Army was defeated at the Battle of Lemberg and the mighty fort city of Przemysl was besieged (it would fall in March 1915). In May 1915, Italy joined the Allies and attacked Austria- Hungary. The bloody but indecisive fighting on the Italian front would last for the next three and a half years. It was only this front that the Austrians proved effective in war, managing to hold back the numerically superior Italian armies in the Alps. In the summer, the Austro-Hungarian Army, working under a unified command with the Germans, participated in the successful Gorlice‚ÄìTarnow Offensive. Later in 1915, the Austro-Hungarian Army, in conjunction with the German and Bulgarian armies, conquered Serbia. In 1916, the Russians focused their attacks on the Austro-Hungarian Army in the Brusilov Offensive, recognizing the numerical inferiority of the Austro- Hungarian Army. The Austrian armies took massive losses (losing about 1 million men) and never recovered. The huge losses of men and material inflicted on the Russians during the offensive contributed greatly to the causes of their Communist revolution of 1917. The Austro-Hungarian war effort became more and more subordinate to the direction of German planners, as it did with the standard soldiers. The Austrians saw the German army positively, but by 1916 the general belief in Germany was that they were \\"shackled to a corpse\\". Supply shortages, low morale, and the high casualty rate seriously affected the operational abilities of the army, as well as the fact the army was of multiple ethnicity, all with different race, language and customs. The last two successes for the Austrians: the Conquest of Romania and the Caporetto Offensive, were German-assisted operations. Due to the fact that the empire had become more and more dependent on German assistance, the majority of its people, not of Hungarian or Austrian ethnicity, became aware of the empire's destabilization. Assessment Although performance in the initial months of the war against Serbia and Russia is often seen as poor, Austro- Hungarian forces were not helped by internal division and indecision among the army high command and possession by Serbian and Russian forces of highly detailed versions of Austro-Hungarian war plans. Overall during the Military's greatest deployment ‚Äì World War I ‚Äì and despite persistent fears of disloyalty and division among the Empire's many nationalities, the forces of Austria- Hungary must be seen as having performing largely competently until political demise in late 1918. Imperial forces performed with both great proficiency ‚Äì the Otranto Raid, Caporetto, and the dogged defence of the Isonzo; and with appalling effect ‚Äì the Galicia Campaign, the Brusilov Offensive and Vittorio Veneto; as well as at a variety of standards in between. Ultimately, and with much German support, Imperial armed forces held firm, and without much by way of large-scale defections among what were seen as 'suspect' elements of the population until the dying days of the war when political dissent at home led to large-scale defeats both on the front and at Sea as the war came to a close. Legacy Some of the traditions of the old Austro-Hungarian Army continue to be carried on in the modern Austrian Army. For example, the most famous regiment in the Bundesheer is the \\"Hoch und Deutschmeister Regiment\\", now known as J√§gerregiment Wien based in \\"Maria Theresien Kaserne\\", named after Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. Many other regiments of the Bundesheer carry on traditions of the famous Austro-Hungarian regiments like \\"Kaiserj√§ger\\", \\"Rainer\\", etc. Gallery File:Rovine_della_facciata_del_Forte_Vezzena.jpgFort Vezzena File:Forte Prato Piazza2.jpgFort Prato Piazza File:Forte Mitterberga.JPGFort Mitterberga File:Forte prato piazza.jpgFort Prato Piazza File:Lusern. 38cm.Haubitze.

City of Calcutta The ship was built by Charles Connell & Company of Scotstoun, and was launched on 8 September 1881 as SS City of Calcutta for George Smith & Sons' City Line. The ship was long, in the beam, with a draught of , and was powered by a triple expansion steam engine. Hong Moh In 1902 the ship was sold to Lim Ho Puah of Singapore, and renamed SS Hong Moh to operate in the fleet of Wee Bin & Co. In 1911 the ship was transferred to Lim Peng Siang, the son of Lim Ho Puah, when the Wee Bin company was liquidated, and operated by the Ho Hong Steamship Company. Sinking Hong Moh sailed from Hong Kong on 2 March 1921, bound for Swatow, under the command of Henry William Holmes, with a crew of 48 and 1,135 passengers aboard. When she arrived off Swatow on the morning of 3 March, the ship anchored off Bill Island and signalled for a pilot to take her in. When the pilot arrived he informed the master that his ship's draught was too great to cross the bar, so the ship set a course for Amoy. About two hours later, at 7.20 p.m., in rough seas and poor visibility, the ship struck the north-west point of the White Rocks. The weather deteriorated, making it impossible to launch any lifeboats, and at 3 a.m. on 4 March the ship broke in two. Several ships passed within sight of Hong Moh, but having lost electrical power she was unable to signal them. Finally at 9. a.m SS Shansi approached Hong Moh, and attempted to launch her boats. This failed, but the ship stood by until the afternoon of 5 March, rescuing several passengers and crew who had abandoned ship and attempted to swim to safety, many drowning in the process, including the Master. Shansi then sailed into Swatow with about 45 survivors aboard, to procure further assistance for the stricken ship. The British Consul in Swatow informed the Senior Naval Officer at Hong Kong, who broadcast a radio message requesting ships to come to Hong Mohs assistance. The responded, arriving off Swatow around 10.30 p.m, but was unable to locate the wreck in the darkness. At dawn the next morning the arrived, and together the two ships rescued more survivors from the wreck. Running short of fuel Foxglove sailed for Hong Kong at 5 p.m. with 48 survivors aboard, while Carlisle continued to work throughout the night using searchlights, and into the next day. Carlisles captain, Edward Evans, swam over to the wreck at around 8 p.m on 7 March to help the last few survivors aboard the ship's boats. Rescue operations were finally abandoned at 11 p.m. At dawn on 8 March Carlisles boats approached the wreck, but found no signs of life, so Carlisle departed for Hong Kong with 220 survivors aboard. Captain Evans of Carlisle, along with Lieutenant-Commander Ion Tower and Gunner John G. Dewar were awarded the Board of Trade Silver Medal for Gallantry in Saving Life at Sea, while Leading Seaman W. G. Eldrett and Able Seaman A. E. Whitehead received the award in Bronze.

Life Salabega occupies a permanent position among the devotional poets of Odisha who devoted his life for Lord Jagannath. He lived in the first half of the 17th century. Nilamani Mishra, who has written a comprehensive account of the poet and his works, determines the birth of Salabega between circa AD 1607-1608. Salabega was the son of the Mughal subedar, Lalbeg, His father on one of his military excursions came across Dandamukundapur. A young widow lived in that village. Lalbeg took her away and made her his wife. Salabega was their only son. Role as Jagannath devotee As soon as he was old enough, Salabega took up fighting in his father's campaigns. Once he was severely wounded in battle. Battling for life he accepted the advice of his mother, and chanted the holy name of Lord Krishna which cured him miraculously. Feeling greatly indebted to Lord Krishna he tried to know more about Hinduism. From his mother he came to know that Lord Jagannath is incarnation of Lord Krishna. Amazed and thrilled he went to Puri but was refused entrance into the temple of Jagannath due to his Muslim birth. Thereafter he went on foot to Vrindavana wherein he lived the life of an ascetic in the association of sadhus reciting bhajans in honour of Lord Sri Krishna. After one year in Vraja (Vrindavana), he returned to Puri desiring to see the Ratha yatra festival of Lord Jagannath, but on the way he suddenly fell ill. Feeling helpless and realising that he would not reach Puri in time to see the Ratha yatra festival, he offered prayers to Lord Jagannath petitioning Him to wait until he arrived. On the day of the return Cart festival, Nandighosa, the cart of Lord Jagannath, did not move until Salabega's arrival. The place where the cart remained stationary to give darshana to Salabega was later used by Salabega for composing his many bhajans in honour of Lord Jagannath. His body was cremated there after his death. The Samadhi of this great devotee is still standing on the Grand road in Puri near Balagandi. In honour of him every year during the cart festival, the cart of Lord Jagannath stays for a while near his Samadhi. The poet identified Jagannath completely with Sri Krishna. His bhajans are still popular among the devotees of Lord Jagannath. Salabega composed numerous devotional songs but not all of them have survived. Most of his compositions are prayers and hymns to Lord Jagannath and Krishna. A good number of these deal with the romantic dalliance of Krishna with the gopis and Radha, while a few are inspired by the vatsalya ras, the sweet, motherly feeling Yashoda had for child Krishna. Work His deep devotion has intensity and passion, outstanding even in the devotional literature of the Bhakti era. Although the poet was denied entry into the temple, his descriptions of the inner compound and the sanctum are among the most detailed and accurate in the devotional literature of Odisha. His song ‚ÄòAhe Neelashaila (Oh Bluestone lord)...‚Äô is perhaps the best description of Bedha Parikrama, or the prescribed circumambulation of the Srimandira. Many of the historical events of the period are recounted in his songs. The poet refers, with deep anguish, to the depredations of the marauders in their attacks on Puri and the repeated attempts to loot and desecrate the Srimandira. This frequently necessitated shifting the deities outside the main sanctum and the poet gives graphic details in the song ‚ÄòKene gheni jaucchha jagannatha nku... Aahe Nila Shaila; Prabal matta Varan mo aarata nalinee bana ku kara dalana! Gajaraja chinta kala thai ghora jalena, Chakra peshi nakra nashi, uddhrile aapana! Ghorabane mrugini ku padithila kashana, Kede bada beepatti ru kariaccha tarana. Kurusabha tale suni Draupadi ra janana, Koti bastra dei hele lajja kala barana! Ravana ra bhai Bivishana gala saran, Saran sambhali tanku, Lanke kala raajana. Prahlada pita se je bada dushta daruna, Stambha ru bahari taku bidarila takhana. Kahe Salabega hina jaati re mu jabana, Sriranga charan tale karuachhi janana.

Shortly after her arrival in England from France in 1247, her half-brother arranged her marriage to the Earl, which incurred some resentment from the English nobility.Costain, Thomas B. (1959). The Magnificent Century. Garden City, New York: Doubleday and Company, Inc. p.151  Lineage  Alice was the second eldest daughter of Hugh X de Lusignan, \\"le Brun\\", Seigneur de Lusignan, Count of La Marche and Isabella of Angoul√™me, queen dowager of England. She was born in Lusignan, Poitou, France in 1224, and was a member of the House of Lusignan. She had five full brothers and three full sisters, besides her royal half-siblings from her mother's first marriage. Lusignan, Vienne, France, the birthplace of Alice le Brun de Lusignan  Marriage  In 1247, a year after her mother's death, Alice accompanied the new papal legate William of Modena, the Cardinal Bishop of Sabina, to England, which she had decided to make her home, and live at the expense of the Crown.Costain p.151. In August of that year, her half-brother, King Henry married her to John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey (August 1231 ‚Äì 29 September 1304). The marriage caused some resentment amongst the English nobility, as they considered the King's Lusignan siblings to be parasites and a liability to the Kingdom. Many prestigious honours and titles were granted to the Lusignans.Costain, p.151 Alice was also said to have been disdainful of all things English.Costain,page 151.

History   Proposals   Burundi / Rwanda rail plans of 2000  In 2000 Burundi and Rwanda announced plans to build a rail line linking their two countries to the Tanzanian rail network, and thus to the Indian Ocean port of Dar es Salaam. 2006 delay According to the Rwanda News Agency the African Development Bank was responsible for a 2006 delay in surveying the route of a rail link from Isaka through Rwanda's capital Kigali to Bujumbura. The initial feasibility study was to cost $2.7 million. According to the Rwandan News Agency officials stated the African Development Bank was to have loaned 90% of the cost of the railway, with the remainder paid by Tanzania and Rwanda. The Rwanda News Agency reported that an Indian firm named RITES was expected to take over the contract for the management of the Isaka line. A delegation from the American railroad BNSF also met with President Paul Kagame to discuss a route from Kigali to Isaka and at the same time the government announced that it had selected a German consulting company to undertake pilot work for the proposed mail line.  Chinese survey of 2007  China had played a big role in building the TAZARA part of Tanzania's rail network, and in 2007 conducted a survey for extending the network into Rwanda.  2008 plan  On January 26, 2008 Rwanda's President announced plans for BNSF Railway to build a link from Rwanda's capital Kigali to Tanzania's rail network in Isaka Tanzania. Some reports state the new line would be a narrow gauge, like the rest of Tanzania's rail service. Other reports state that Tanzania has already decided to upgrade its Isaka line to standard gauge, and that the Isaki-Kigali link would also be standard gauge. Yet other reports state that the Isaka-Rwanda leg would be of standard gauge and that cargo would be transshipped to different rolling stock in Isaka. According to Reuters political unrest in neighboring Kenya has disrupted the reliability of road and rail service through Kenya, and the Rwandan line would allow rail transport to bypass Kenya if rail transport was disrupted there in future. The proposed plan was projected to be complete by 2013. Projected costs have not yet been announced.  2013 Plan  More plans are being made for a link from Uganda.http://www.railwaysafrica.com/blog/2013/10/new-railway-from-rwanda-to- uganda/ Opening ceremony in November 2013 for standard gauge railway from Mombasa, Kenya via Nairobi and Kampala to Rwanda and Burundi.Photo and Maphttp://www.railwaysafrica.com/blog/2011/07/07/african-development-bank- grants-for-study/  Under Construction  * (Standard Gauge opening ceremony Nov 2013) New stations are bond to come up after the completion of the standard gauge railway http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/africa/2013-11/29/c_132926989.htmPhoto and Map * Mombassa - port * Emali - concrete sleepers http://naibuzz.com/2015/04/13/photos-standard-gauge-railway-construction-in- kenya/ * Nairobi - capital of Kenya * Kampala - capital of Uganda * Kigali - capital of Rwanda * Bujumbura - former capital of Burundi  Technical measures to overcome Break of Gauge  On 31 May 2008, a proposal to link the railways of Egypt, gauge, and Sudan, gauge, surfaced, with \\"Technical measures\\" to overcome the Break of gauge.

It was first published in the USA by the Katherine Teegan imprint of Harper Collins publishers (April, 2005). It later appeared in the UK (October, 2005) and Italy (February, 2006).Christine Morton-Shaw Plot The Riddles of Epsilon focuses on the character of Jessica (‚ÄòJess‚Äô), who moves with her mother and father to the fictional island of Lume, far from the mainland (Scotland), after being expelled from school. While speaking to her friend Avril in an internet chatroom, Jess encounters the mysterious character of ‚ÄòV,‚Äô Who was a ghost who begins to warn her of an impending danger, relating to Lume‚Äôs distant past. Later she dreams of a boy named Sebastian, who she realizes lived in this same house nearly one hundred years previously. As the story progresses, events in Jess‚Äôs life begin to parallel those of Sebastian‚Äôs, particularly the fact that both the children‚Äôs mothers seem to be acting incredibly strangely. Much of the exposition in the novel is handled by way of riddles and clues, which take the form of puzzles and images, through which Jess discovers, with the help of ‚ÄòV,‚Äô the truth about the strange events taking place on Lume. Jess, having recently moving house to the Island of Lume after being expelled from school, is talking with her friend Avril in an internet chatroom, when someone called V also appears in the chatroom, who kicks Avril out of the chatroom. He talks about her being on Lume, despite her not mentioning the name to Avril. Later, exploring the island, Jess discovers a small cottage in the forest near the \\"Big House\\", where she now lives. On the black obsidian doorstep are carved symbols and the words \\"WHERE _ _ SILON DWELLS\\". She goes into the cottage, where she thinks she sees a tall shadowy dark man standing by a rocking chair, but when she blinks, he is only an old coat with the sleeve resting on the chair. She attempts to explore the house, but then sees the rocking chair moving by itself. Terrified, she rushes out into the garden, where she discovers an arrow carved on the garden wall, pointing into the ground. She digs down at the place specified and discovers an old bucket, with a symbol like \\"half a feather, on its side\\" and the word \\"EPSILON\\" carved on its base. In the chat room that evening telling Avril about it, the mysterious V appears and tells her to put the bucket on her windowsill. Later investigating, Jess finds that she can find no trace of \\"V\\" in the chatroom history or on the print-outs of her conversations with Avril. As V told her, she puts the bucket in her window and finds that somehow 37 symbols are projected on the walls of her room, despite there being nothing on the bucket for them to reflect off. She copies them down, and upon entering the chatroom, is told by V to use the symbols on the black doorstep at the cottage to translate them. She questions him as to how he knew the black doorstep was there, but he logs out of the chatroom. She uses the English words on the doorstep to translate the symbols from the bucket when her parents are out which turns out to be the verse, \\"With a mirrored dream A followed sound Thus let it begin.\\" Before she can puzzle this out any further, her parents return from their walk, having found a \\"whole belemnite, whatever that is\\". Later that night she has a dream about a boy, sleeping in her attic bed, who wakes in the middle of the night and scribbles on a piece of paper before rushing outside, drinking from a water pump and then following the sound of a flute down towards the cottage. Jess wakes up herself, writes about her dream in her diary, before realising she too can still hear the flute music, which she follows down to the cottage. She walks in the door, and the flute music stops, the flute itself falling to the ground, as if whoever had been playing it had literally just dropped it. She picks it up, and finds it dusty and ancient, with Epsilon's symbol carved on it. She tries to blow it, and blows out a piece of paper stuck inside it. The paper is a sketch of her, sitting in her attic bed, reaching out for her globe lamp, and also a diary page written by a boy called Sebastian Wren. The diary page is apparently what she saw Sebastian writing in her dream before he went down the cottage, and in it he talks about just having a dream himself about a girl who follows a flute down to the cottage (Jess). He talks about her nose ring being a sign of the 'Borus, which Jess does not understand, and also that Epsilon has told him to write the diary. He signs it, using the words \\"as Agapetos is my witness\\", and the date, 1894. Jess is bewildered, but realises the words a \\"followed sound\\" mean the flute music, and the \\"mirrored dream\\" is what she and Sebastian have just experienced: \\"I drew him, just as he looked when he woke after dreaming of me. He drew me, just as I looked when I woke from a dream about him.\\" But she doesn't know what will now begin. The next day Jess falls ill, and her Mum, concerned, gives her the belemnite she found, which Jess does not appreciate - \\")Oh wow. A baby stone carrot. Why can't she give me a CD like other mums?)\\" The doctor, Dr. Parker, also comes to check her over, and tells her that it is probably just running about in the heatwave, and that even in the early mornings when she goes out she must be careful. She spills out all her woes to Dr. Parker, but feels protective when he picks up the bucket off her windowsill, and feels like something is flowing out of it. He invites her to his garden party, the Greet, next week, and leaves, but when Jess checks the bottom of the bucket again, the base is bare - Epsilon's name and symbol have gone. In the chatroom, Jess works out that V is actually Epsilon, as he gives her the riddle \\"V is a letter that is not a letter\\". The letter V actually corresponds to the Roman numeral 5, E is the fifth letter of the alphabet, and in Greek the letter \\"E\\" is called \\"Epsilon\\". Epsilon tells her that her mother is in danger, and that she shouldn't trust Dr. Parker. He also tells her that someone evil is watching her, whom he calls the \\"Eye of Miradel\\". Jess becomes exasperated with him and leaves the chat room. She later goes down to the cottage, where she spots the tall, dark man again. She opens one of the drawers in the desk, to find 3 boxes, only the first of which she can open. In it she finds another diary page from Sebastian. He has discussed the girl he saw in his dream (Jess) with Epsilon, and the whole village is getting ready for the Greet. His mother is behaving strangely, collecting hundreds of shells from the beach, which she has dumped in his father's hollyhocks, which has made him angry; Epsilon has warned Sebastian to look after her. He also writes down the \\"Ballad of Yoland√´\\", which he has heard the carver of the may pole (or the Coscoroba), Jerry Cork, singing. Epsilon also warns him that this ballad is not all it seems and gives him the clue \\"V then V then V then V\\", which Sebastian does not understand. He has also heard his mother singing this ballad in the middle of the night, which worries him. Jess reads the ballad and cannot understand what Epsilon means about it, as it seems perfectly innocuous. But then, in another chat Jess has had with Epsilon, when Epsilon said goodbye, E, \\"Or should I say V.\\" At this she realized there were 5 V's, not four, and this is what she finds out from \\"The Ballad of Yolande\\" (every five words): \\"I awake in the time of dark choices I stir in my wrath For the treasures of the deep Are hidden from my eyes. The workers of my enemy are busy. I will call my faithful out From east, west, north and south. I sip weakness like nectar - Crush honesty to dust. My bone hands bring lies and death. I must possess! My black heart sows ruin; To ruin is my delight. Mark my chanting, travellers -- Flee from my song of beauty!\\" She was appalled at this, and went on the greatest, biggest adventure of her life, to save her mother, and herself, and destroy the evil beings. Themes The novel deals with the ideas of good and evil found in most fantasy fiction, whilst also blurring the lines between the two and asking questions about whether evil is easy to identify. Family discord and the importance of family is another key theme, as is the importance of courage. The novel also has a preoccupation with the passage and nature of time. Critical reception The Riddles of Epsilon received many positive reviews on its publication in 2005. The Voice of Youth Advocates (VOYA) rated the novel as a \\"perfect ten\\" for both literary quality and \\"teen appeal\\". VOYA said of Epsilon, \\"this novel rises above clich√©, shining through well- developed and intriguing characters, a tangible atmosphere and heart-stopping pacing.\\" The novel was also longlisted in the UK for the Manchester Children's book awards. Those reviews criticising elements of the novel have tended to focus on its dark atmosphere, complicated plot development and the use of a diary device through which to tell the story.

It has been suggested that Homoscleromorpha are more closely related to eumetazoans than to the other sponge groups, rendering sponges paraphyletic.Sperling, Pisani and Peterson 2007, cited in: The Cambrian Explosion p. 80, Erwin and Valentine 2013 This view has not been supported by later work using larger datasets and new techniques for phylogenetic inference, which tend to support sponges as monophyletic, with Homoscleromorpha grouping together with Calcarea.Nosenko, T., Schreiber, F., Adamska, M., Adamski, M., Eitel, M., Hammel, J., Maldonado, M., M√ºller, W.

There are 117 species in this group divided into 9 genera. The spiculate genera in this group are Aspiculophora, Corticium, Placinolopha, Plakina, Plakinasterella, Plakortis and Tetralophophora. The aspiculate species are the genera Oscarella and Pseudocorticium. Description These sponges are massive or encrusting in form and have a very simple structure with very little variation in spicule form (all spicules tend to be very small). Reproduction is viviparous and the larva is an oval form known as an amphiblastula. This form is usual in calcareous sponges but is less common in other sponges. Habitat These sponges typically inhabit shady locations, under overhangs and inside caves. In the Mediterranean Sea, 82% of the species in this taxon can be found in caves, and 41% of them are found nowhere else. References External links * What are sponges?

This position was developed to provide a single vision across all methods of customer contact. The CCO is often responsible for influencing corporate activities of customer relations in the call centre, sales, marketing, user interface, finance (billing), fulfillment and post-sale support. The CCO typically reports to the chief executive officer, and is potentially a member of the board of directors. Chief Customer Officers may be known by many titles; however, according to the Chief Customer Officer Council, the CCO is properly defined as \\"an executive who provides the comprehensive and authoritative view of the customer and creates corporate and customer strategy at the highest levels of the company to maximize customer acquisition, retention, and profitability.\\" Today's customer requires access in many forms of media to meet their preferences and lifestyle, such as traditional voice agent, outsourced/offshored voice agent, automated voice (interactive voice response or IVR), Email, traditional mail, web chat, web collaboration, web co-browse, text, point of presence (PoP) such as sales register or kiosk, faxes, etc. A consistent customer experience across all methods of access is required by customers, who often choose to change vendors if they do not get the support they require to meet their expectations. A 2010 study by the Chief Customer Officer Council documented that there are approximately 450 executives worldwide with the CCO title or having comparable authority and responsibilities under a different title. While growing from fewer than 30 in 2003, CCOs are the newest, and by far the smallest, component of the C-suite. With an average tenure of just 29 months, the chief customer officer has the shortest lifespan among all C-suite executives. Because the CCO role is still so new, there is as yet no executive MBA program or even a Harvard Business Review treatise about becoming a CCO. Jeanne Bliss, who was the Chief Customer Officer for Lands' End, Microsoft, Mazda, Coldwell Banker and Allstate Corporations has written multiple books on the role of the Chief Customer Officer based on her twenty five years' experience in the role. While not a requirement that the CCO be a board-level position, to be effective, the Chief Customer Officer Council advises that the CCO must be one of the senior-most executives of the company. Chief Customer Officers typically report directly to the CEO, although there are some exceptions. A 2009 study of over 860 corporate executives revealed that companies that had increased their investment in customer experience management over the previous three years reported higher customer referral rates and customer satisfaction (Strativity Group, 2009). In 2011, the Customer Experience Professionals Association was created to support and encourage the growth of the customer experience profession and the role of the Chief Customer Officer. CXPA is a by-members, for-members professional association composed of several thousand customer experience professionals worldwide. CXPA created the Certified Customer Experience Professional (CCXP) credential. References Further reading * Bingham, Curtis, founder and executive director of the Chief Customer Officer Council.

He was involved in two well-publicized shootouts of the day. Early life Loving was born in Jackson County, Missouri, and later moved with his family to Texas, where his father died in the early 1870s. He began making his living as a professional gambler by his late teens, and was often found in saloons. He eventually moved to Dodge City, Kansas. Loving began to frequent the Long Branch Saloon, where he became associated with other well-known gamblers, gunmen, and lawmen, which included Doc Holliday, Bat Masterson, Wyatt Earp, and Charlie Bassett. Loving developed a friendship with a gambler and reputed gunfighter, Levi Richardson. He also became good friends with Long Branch Saloon owner Chalkley Beeson.Frank Loving; Legends of America; accessed September 2019 Long Branch Saloon Gunfight Background Levi Richardson had a tough disposition and was disliked by most of the townspeople, but did get along fairly well with Masterson. He had a reputation as a gunman, despite it being mostly hearsay. In early 1879, Loving quarreled with Richardson. Loving, who was married, claimed that Richardson was making unwanted and disrespectful advances toward his wife, Mattie Loving. In March the two were involved in a fist fight on Front Street. After exchanging punches, Richardson exclaimed \\"I'll blow the guts out of you, you cockeyed son of a bitch\\". Loving, not being armed, simply turned and walked away. The gunfight On April 5, 1879, Richardson entered the Long Branch Saloon‚Äîspecifically looking for Loving‚Äîbut Loving was not there at that time. Richardson joined a game of poker and waited. About 9:00 pm, Loving walked in and took a seat at a table. Richardson moved over and sat across from him. The two men could be heard arguing. Suddenly, Richardson said loudly, \\"You wouldn't fight anything you damned son of a bitch\\", to which Loving said calmly, \\"Try me and see.\\" Richardson stood and drew his gun, which prompted Loving to do the same. Both men repeatedly fired their weapons, (Richardson got off five rounds and Loving six). When the shooting stopped, Richardson had been shot in the chest, side, and arm. He was dead. Loving had been grazed on the hand, but was otherwise uninjured. Aftermath No one else in the saloon was injured. City Marshal Bassett and his deputy, responded, having heard the shots.Dodge City Shootout, Long Branch Saloon; SkyWays, online Library; Kansas; accessed ??? Loving was arrested. On April 7, 1879, a coroner's inquest ruled the shooting was self defense, and Loving was released without charges. The Globe, a local newspaper, wrote: \\"It seemed strange that Loving was not hit, except for a slight scratch on the hand, as the two men were so close together that their pistols almost touched each other.\\" The shootout was dubbed the Long Branch Saloon Gunfight. Although numerous gunfights took place in that saloon, this is the most well known. Following the gunfight, Loving left Mattie and his children to travel the country as a gambler. By 1880, he had traveled to Trinidad, Colorado. Trinidad gunfight On April 15, 1882, an argument over a game of cards subsequently led to Frank Loving and John Allen drawing their pistols on one another in the center of Main Street. Mutual friends intervened and there was no further violence at that time. Allen had been an acquaintance of Loving from Dodge City. Gunning for each other The next morning, however, Loving entered the Imperial Saloon, where Allen worked, with a pistol in hand. Allen drew and shot at Loving but missed. Loving responded by firing back at Allen, which also missed, but set the saloon patrons scrambling for the door. In the confusion, Loving's gun was knocked from his hand. Allen, who used another man as a shield, wildly fired his gun several times at Loving as he searched for his revolver. Allen fired a total of three shots at Loving, two while Loving was unarmed and trying to retrieve his dropped pistol. All missed their target. Loving found his pistol and emptied it at Allen as he ran out the rear door into the alley behind the saloon. All his shots missed the fleeing Allen, who immediately took refuge a few doors down in Hammond's Hardware Store. Loving searched the alley for Allen, but was unable to find him. Trinidad Deputy Marshal James Masterson, a former Dodge City, Kansas Marshal and an acquaintance of Loving, responded to the commotion. He found Loving still in the vicinity of the saloon, and disarmed him. Masterson was unable to locate Allen. When he returned to the saloon, Masterson found that Loving had re-armed himself with two revolvers and had again gone out looking for Allen. By then, Loving had entered the hardware store to buy ammunition for the guns he had acquired. Allen ambushed and shot Loving from behind. Masterson heard the shot come from the hardware store. Masterson and a local City Marshal, Lou Kreeger, found Frank Loving badly wounded. When Loving saw Masterson, he stated, \\"Jim, I'm shot.\\" Masterson and Kreeger arrested Allen, finding him still hiding in the back of the store. Loving was treated for his wound, but died five days later on April 21, 1882. Aftermath Allen was tried for murder in September, 1882. Allen successfully argued that he acted in self-defense and that he feared for his life. Probably due to Loving having some notoriety as a dangerous man, Allen was acquitted.

Parents Charles Wood was the 7th of 15 children of William Wood of Wolverhampton and his wife Margaret, daughter of Richard Molyneux, an ironmonger in that area. William Wood followed his father-in-law's trade until 1715, when he became an ironmaster too and later entered into a contract to provide copper coinage for Ireland. He was also a projector, floating his business as an ironmaster as a joint stock company at the time of the South Sea Bubble (1720). Later, he sought to develop a new process of ironmaking and to obtain a charter for a \\"Company of Ironmasters of Great Britain\\". However the process (carried on at Frizington, Cumberland) produced little iron and he probably died in debt.Treadwell 1974; 1976. Career Charles Wood was a partner in some of the businesses, and certainly in the final one. His father's will left him a legacy of ¬£15000, but his father died insolvent.Will of William Wood: printed copy with inventory at British Library, 816.m.23(132). The result was that Charles and some of his brothers were also made bankrupt in the following years.Treadwell 1974 Jamaica Charles Wood went out to Carolina in 1733 following his bankruptcy but only stayed there a couple of years. He returned to Cumberland to marry Anne Piele of Buttermere and then went to Jamaica to superintend lead mines in Liguanea. They had a child in Jamaica in 1739, but the next was born at Whitehaven. His activities between 1741 and 1747 remain unknown, but in 1747, he was appointed assaymaster to the Governor of Jamaica.Hunt 1985. Platinum In this period, William Brownrigg (from 1742 a Fellow of the Royal Society) reported Wood's experiments on a metal, subsequently known as platinum. This had been found in the course of alluvial gold working in what is now Colombia, and had been smuggled from Cartagena to Jamaica. Wood reported this to Brownrigg in about 1741. Brownrigg reported it to the Royal Society in 1750. They found the metal did not react with acid and was unaffected by the usual process for extracting silver from lead.Hunt 1985, citing Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society 46 (1749‚Äì50), 584‚Äì6. Low Mill, Egremont In 1749, Wood returned to Cumberland to build and manage a forge at Egremont.Riden in Gross 2001, x. His partners were Peter How, William Hicks, and Gabriel Griffiths, a Whitehaven brazier. Wood and How leased coal mines in Egremont, while How, Griffiths, William Brownrigg and Joseph Bowes (a merchant) leased iron ore mines.Cumbria Record Office, D/Lec/240/mines; D/Lec/16/50-6. He recorded experiments in iron making in a memorandum book. Initially he sued iron ore according to his father's process, but later moved on to reworking scrap iron and later still \\"coldshort metal\\", probably pig iron. In September 1754, Wood and toured the Midlands with Gabriel Griffiths, visiting ironworks in the area. They visited fireclay works at Stourbridge and his brother John Wood, who had a forge at Wednesbury. John was working scraps and using pots to do so.Gross, 220. In 1763, Charles and John Wood patented their ironmaking process, which is usually described by historians as potting and stamping. This followed one to John Wood alone in 1761. In December 1763, Peter How's tobacco firm became bankrupt, as did the braziers' business of Gabriel Griffiths and Robert Ross.The National Archives, C 54/6160, nos. 3-6. The fate of the forge is not clear. In 1789, the building had been suffered to decay, and the expense of repairing it was more than the lease was worth, so that the lease was surrendered.Cumbria Record Office, D/Lec/60/26. However, Wood had left there in 1766 to go to Merthyr Tydfil. Cyfarthfa William Brownrigg and Anthony Bacon (a London merchant born in Whitehaven) leased the mines in at Merthyr Tydfil. Wood was brought in to build a forge for them there and he reached Merthyr in April 1766. The forge had six races leading off the river Taff, for a clay mill, two stampers, two hammers, and a chafery.Riden in Gross, xx. In addition there were air furnaces, in which the iron was heated during the refining process. A drying shed for the pots and other buildings. A blast furnace, high and blown by blowing cylinders was begun to be built that autumn, but was probably not completed until the following year. In the meantime, pig iron was needed for the forge to work, so Wood arranged for the owners to take over the nearby Plymouth Furnace. Wood returned to Lowmill in January 1766, but was back at Merthyr in April.Gross, passim He remained there as manager until his death in 1774. His widow stayed there until her death in 1799.Riden in Gross, xxvii. Sources * J. Gross (ed.): The diary of Charles Wood of Cyfarthfa Ironworks, Merthyr Tydfil, 1766-1767, with P.

(), was an English Franciscan friar and writer active in the 17th century. Life He was born Richard Mason in the county of Wiltshire, England, in 1599. Like a number of English Roman Catholics under the Penal laws who desired to enter religious life, he went to Douai in the County of Flanders, then the Spanish Netherlands. There he entered the Order of Friars Minor, being clothed in the habit and given his new name. He was professed in 1625, and ordained to the priesthood four years later. There is the suggestion in some documents of the Order that he served for a time in Ireland after this, possibly himself being of Irish descent.There is some dispute as to the nationality of his extraction: while it is agreed that he was a native of the English county of Wiltshire, a Franciscan MS. record, dated 1721, mentions his having been \\"for some time dean of a Catholick deanery in Ireland\\", conveying a suggestion that his family may have been Irish: Gillow (Bibl. Dict. of the English Catholics) thinks that if Mason ever held a deanery in Ireland, it must have been under the Protestant Establishment, in which case Father Angelus, as he was known among his contemporaries, would have to be reckoned among the seventeenth- century converts. The MS. mentioning his \\"Catholick deanery\\", however, was written forty-three years after Mason's death. Mason rapidly became eminent in the Order, being created a Doctor of Divinity and appointed successively to the high administrative offices of Definitor, Guardian and Visitor to the Franciscan province of Brabant. He was elected Minister Provincial of the English province of the Franciscan Order in 1659. In that office, he visited Paris in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain permission for the settlement there of a colony of English Franciscan Sisters from their convent in Nieuwpoort in Flanders, where he had served as their confessor. From 1662-75 he lived in England, as domestic chaplain to Lord Henry Arundell, 3rd Baron Arundell of Wardour, after which period he retired to the friary at Douai, where he died on 30 December 1678. Works Mason displayed industry in both original composition and the compilation of devotional manuals. The latter include his Sacrarium privilegiorum quorundam Seraphico P. S. Francisco ... indultorum (Douai, 1636), a guide to the indulgences granted to members of the Franciscan Order. He later wrote the Manuale Tertii Ordinis S. Francisci(Douai, 1643), a commentary and meditations on the Rule of the Third Order of St. Francis, in which he gives guidance to Franciscan tertiaries on their way of life. This he soon translated into English as The Rule of Penance of the Seraphical Father St. Francis (Douai, 1644). Among his historical writings are \\"Certamen Seraphicum Provinciae Angliae pro Sancta Dei Ecclesia\\" (Douai, 1649), a review of distinguished English Franciscan martyrs and polemical writers, and \\"Apologia pro Scoto Anglo\\" (Douai, 1656). The last-named work has for its main scope the establishment (against John Colgan) of the thesis that Duns Scotus was not a Scotsman, but an Englishman. His Liturgical Discourse of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass (s. 1, 1670, dedicated to Henry, Lord Arundell of Wardour, \\"Master of the Horse to our late Queen Mother Henrietta Maria\\"), was abridged in the Holy Altar and Sacrifice Explained which Friar Pacificus Baker, O.F.M., published at the request of Bishop James Talbot in London in 1768.

Joseph Chaumi√© was born in Agen, Lot-et-Garonne, into a family of modest means. He studied law at the Sorbonne in Paris and although he was a successful student, he was unsuccessful in obtaining permission to practice at the bar in Paris, probably due to the influence of police reports which described him as a revolutionary. He returned to Agen where he practised law. In 1886, he was elected to the town council in Agen and served as mayor from 1896 to 1900. He was elected to the Senate in 1897. He was one of those who worked with Ren√© Waldeck-Rousseau to create the Democratic Republican Alliance, of which he was vice-president. A highly regarded orator and active member of the Senate, he served as Education minister 1902 to 1905 in the government of √âmile Combes and then Justice minister in until 1906 in the second and third governments of Maurice Rouvier. Under Combes, he oversaw the integration of the staff of the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure into the University of Paris. He represented the government at √âmile Zola's funeral and other key events. He was a strong supporter of the separation of church and state enshrined in the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, a law which had a great impact on education. After he left government he became involved in a dispute with Maurice Bunau-Varilla's newspaper Le Matin, which accused him of nepotism and favouritism. He claimed that he was being attacked because he refused to share documents on the Dreyfus affair with the paper and began a libel (diffamation) action, eventually winning his case. These events put a strain on his health and he was afterwards much less active in the Senate. He died at Clermont-Dessous in Lot-et-Garonne in 1919. His sons Jacques (1877‚Äì1920), Pierre (1880‚Äì1966), and Emmanuel (1890‚Äì1934), were all active in politics.

It also publishes a weekly Sunday supplement titled Vas√°rnap (, before 1990: Vas√°rnapi √öj Sz√≥). History √öj Sz√≥ was established by a party order on 1 December 1948. It originally started as a weekly magazine of the Hungarian branch of the Communist Party of Slovakia (KSS) first printed on 15 December 1948, but quickly transformed into a daily newspaper which was first printed on 1 May 1949. The original banner of the newspaper read Workers of the world, unite!, but following a governmental order, it was changed (from 21 May 1951) to \\"daily newspaper of the Communist Party of Slovakia\\". The newspaper slowly shifted from hard-line communist doctrine to the point where, during the Prague Spring in 1968, it denied cooperation with the ruling party. Later control of the paper was transferred from the media section of the party to its central committee. √öj Sz√≥ was a defended the minority rights of Hungarians in Slovakia, particularly after 1968, and became the target of Slovak nationalists. Later in that year, on October 7, 1968 the newspaper launched a somewhat independent weekly weekend magazine under the name Vas√°rnapi √öj Sz√≥. During the night of 8-9 March 1987 the headquarters of √öj Sz√≥, Csemadok and some other Hungarian organizations' based in Bratislava were attacked and damaged, but no one was injured. On 14 January 1988, the chief editor J√≥zsef Kiss was elected into the Central Committee of the Communist Party, becoming the first ethnic-Hungarian in that position. On 18 December 1989, √öj Sz√≥ rehabilitated all of those associates who were fired or excluded on political reasons. On 2 January 1990, the banner changed to \\"Czechoslovakian Hungarian Leftist newspaper\\" and on the following day, its publisher changed from the KSS to the Pravda Publishing Company. (Pravda means truth in Slovak) Three days later the weekly weekend magazine of √öj Sz√≥ shortened its name from Vas√°rnapi √öj Sz√≥ to Vas√°rnap. Later that year, the paper switched to Apollopress Publishing, then to Slovakopress, then to Vox Nova plc (which was established by the editorial guard of the newspaper) and again changed its banner to \\"independent newspaper\\". Its editors quickly joined the newly established Czechoslovakian Journalists Syndicate's Hungarian subsidiary. The banner has changed twice since, first in 1994 to \\"Slovakian Hungarian daily newspaper\\" (\\"Szlov√°kiai Magyar Napilap\\") and in July 2008, when it removed all subtitles. In 1992, 51% of the publishing company Vox Nova was sold to Socpresse to gain financial stability for √öj Sz√≥. However Socpresse soon got into financial trouble on its own, and had to sell the (otherwise profitable) paper to Rheinische Allgemeine Verlag und Druckerei (publisher of Lidov√© noviny, Rheinische Post and various other newspapers) in 1996. They soon grew their ownership to 90% in Vox Nova, before selling it, in 1999, to Passauer Verlagsgruppe, which fused with Grande Presse in 2001 to form the current (as of June 2008) publishing company, Petit Press, and thus √öj Sz√≥ became \\"sisters\\" with various regional and nationwide Slovak newspapers, most notably with SME and The Slovak Spectator. Vas√°rnap was the weekend subsidiary of √öj Sz√≥ until 2001 when the two became fully separated. Until 2001 both newspapers had the same chief editor. Meanwhile, the online version of the newspaper had launched too, first at ujszo.sk, which now redirects to the current website, ujszo.com. Both the online and print version of the newspaper underwent a redesign in July 2008, and the banner of the online edition was replaced by the newspaper's which was also somewhat redesigned. √öj Sz√≥ online's former banner (2001-2008) References External links * Archive of √öj Sz√≥ online (2001‚Äì2007), epa.oszk.hu (Elektronikus Periodika Arch√≠vum) (Hungarian) * Chronology of the Hungarians in Slovakia (Hungarian) (English version) * Mercator Institute research on Hungarian language in Slovakia Category:Publications established in 1948 Category:Hungarian-language newspapers Category:Mass media in Hungary Category:Newspapers published in Slovakia Category:Hungarian culture Category:Mass media in Bratislava Category:Hungarians in Slovakia ","title":"√öj Sz√≥"},{"id":"17731417","text":"Metrodorus of Scepsis () (c. 145 BCE - 70 BCE), from the town of Scepsis in ancient Mysia, was a friend of Mithridates VI of Pontus and celebrated in antiquity for the excellence of his memory. He may be the same Metrodorus who, according to the Elder Pliny, in consequence of his hostility to the Romans, was surnamed the \\"Rome-hater\\" (\\"Misorom√¶us\\"). Information on Metrodorus is very scarce. View of the village of Kur≈üuntepe from the site of ancient Scepsis. Life The fullest ancient account of the life of Metrodorus is to be found in Strabo: > From Scepsis came also Demetrius, whom I often mention, the grammarian who > wrote a commentary on The Marshalling of the Trojan Forces, and was born at > about the same time as Crates and Aristarchus; and later, Metrodorus, a man > who changed from his pursuit of philosophy to political life, and taught > rhetoric, for the most part, in his written works; and he used a brand-new > style and dazzled many. On account of his reputation he succeeded, though a > poor man, in marrying brilliantly in Chalcedon; and he passed for a > Chalcedonian. And having paid court to Mithridates Eupator, he with his wife > sailed away with him to Pontus; and he was treated with exceptional honor, > being appointed to the judgeship from which there was no appeal to the king. > However, his good fortune did not continue, but he incurred the enmity of > men less just than himself and revolted from the king when he was on the > embassy to Tigranes the Armenian. And Tigranes sent him back against his > will to Eupator, who was already in flight from his ancestral realm; but > Metrodorus died on the way, whether by order of the king or from disease; > for both accounts are given of his death. So much for the Scepsians.Strabo, > Geography, Bk. XIII, Ch.1, 55 (English translation in edition ed. by H.C. > Hamilton, Esq., W. Falconer, M.A.) Strabo is an important source for > information on Metrodorus, as he was a near-contemporary (writing > approximately 70 years after the time of Metrodorus) and a native of Amasya, > the old capitol of the Pontic kings. For a time Mithridates had avoided capture by the Romans by staying within the territory of Tigranes, with an ambiguous status somewhere between that of a guest and prisoner. Metrodorus was apparently with Tigranes at this time. Plutarch offers one relevant account of these circumstances in The Life of Lucullus: > Up to this time Tigranes had not deigned to see Mithridates, nor speak to > him, though the man was allied to him by marriage,Mithridates' daughter > Cleopatra had married Tigranes to cement an alliance in 94 BC. and had been > expelled from such a great kingdom. Instead, he had kept him at the farthest > remove possible, in disgrace and contumely, and had suffered him to be held > a sort of prisoner in marshy and sickly regions. Now, however, he summoned > him to his palace with marks of esteem and friendship. There, in secret > conference, they strove to allay their mutual suspicions at the expense of > their friends, by laying the blame upon them. One of these was Metrodorus of > Scepsis, a man of agreeable speech and wide learning, who enjoyed the > friendship of Mithridates in such a high degree that he was called the > king's father. This man, as it seems, had once been sent as an ambassador > from Mithridates to Tigranes, with a request for aid against the Romans. On > this occasion Tigranes asked him: \\"But what is your own advice to me, > Metrodorus, in this matter?\\" Whereupon Metrodorus, either with an eye to the > interests of Tigranes, or because he did not wish Mithridates to be saved, > said that as an ambassador he urged consent, but as an adviser he forbade > it. Tigranes disclosed this to Mithridates, not supposing, when he told him, > that he would punish Metrodorus past all healing. But Metrodorus was at once > put out of the way. Then Tigranes repented of what he had done, although he > was not entirely to blame for the death of Metrodorus. He merely gave an > impulse, as it were, to the hatred which Mithridates already had for the > man. For he had long been secretly hostile to him, as was seen from his > private papers when they were captured, in which there were directions that > Metrodorus, as well as others, be put to death. Accordingly, Tigranes gave > the body of Metrodorus a splendid burial, sparing no expense upon the man > when dead, although he had betrayed him when alive.Plutarch, The Parallel > Lives, Life of Lucullus, English translation from Loeb Edition of 1914 Ovid also mentions (possibly the same) Metrodorus briefly: > Scepsian Metrodorus attacked Italian ways, not the land, in bitter writing: > and Rome itself was accused of guilt: yet Rome accepted the lying invective > equably, and the author‚Äôs wild speech did him no harm.Ovid, Epistulae ex > ponto, Bk. IV, Ch. xiv Metrodorus is frequently mentioned alongside one Charmadas, a member of the Academy who taught for a time at the Athenian Ptolemaeum, and a pupil of Carneades. They are together mentioned in five different passages as both being notable for their powers of memory.They are mentioned together in the context of memory once by Quintilian, once by Pliny, and three times by Cicero, see: Charles Brittain, Philo of Larissa: The Last of the Academic Sceptics, Oxford, 2001, p316 A few other valuable details are available in Cicero's De Oratore (3.75): > Although I was thirsting for them, I barely tasted the arts I am speaking of > when I was a quaestor in Asia, where I obtained a near contemporary of mine, > a rhetor from the Academy ‚Äì the Metrodorus whose memory Antoninus was > recalling... According to Charles Brittain, this would allow us to guess a rough birth date for Metrodorus around 145 BCE and clearly indicates an affiliation with the Academy. It also demonstrates that Metrodorus was a rhetorician. Brittain goes on to speculate that Metrodorus most likely studied at the Academy some time during the period roughly 130-110 BCE, before his return to Asia. Brittain notes, \\"This does not prove that Charmadas taught Metrodorus, of course, but someone did, at a time when Charmadas, who was clearly interested in rhetoric, was in Athens.\\" Brittain also suggests, \\"This makes Metrodorus the earliest (certain) Academic rhetorician...\\"Charles Brittain, Philo of Larissa: The Last of the Academic Sceptics, Oxford, 2001, p316 including footnotes 37 and 38 Powers of memory Metrodorus is frequently mentioned by Classical authors such as Cicero, Quintilian, and Pliny the Elder as one famous for the power of his memory. He was thought to have been a key figure in the development of the art of memory, a loosely associated group of mnemonic principles and techniques which are used to organize memory impressions, improve recall, and assist in the combination and 'invention' of ideas.The Art of Memory, Frances A. Yates, 1966, pp 39-42 The memory of Metrodorus is mentioned in Cicero's De oratore (Book 2, 88) where Crassus states, \\"I have seen the greatest men, men endowed with an almost divine memory; at Athens Carneades; and Metrodorus of Scepsis in Asia, whom I hear is still living; and both these said, that they used ideas upon those places, which they wanted to retain in their memories, in the same manner as one does characters upon wax.\\"Cicero, De oratore (trans. William Guthrie), London, 1755 The Elder Pliny's reference to Metrodorus' powers of memory explicitly states that he perfected the art of memory which was itself thought to have been created by Simonides of Ceos. > Mithridates, who was king of twenty-two nations, administered their laws in > as many languages, and could harangue each of them, without employing an > interpreter. There was in Greece a man named Charmidas, who, when a person > asked him for any book in a library, could repeat it by heart, just as > though he were reading. Memory, in fine, has been made an art; which was > first invented by the lyric poet, Simonides, and perfected by Metrodorus of > Scepsis, so as to enable persons to repeat word for word exactly what they > have heard.Pliny The Elder, Natural History, 7.24 1855 Bostock and Riley > translation From Quintilian we learn that the techniques employed in the art of memory, as developed by Metrodorus, included the use of a memorized scheme based upon 360 places in twelve zodiacal signs: > Images are as words by which we note the things we have to learn, so that as > Cicero says, 'we use places as wax and images as letters'. ... which makes > me wonder all the more how Metrodorus can have found three hundred and sixty > places in the twelve signs through which the sun moves. It was doubtless the > vanity and boastfulness of a man glorying in a memory stronger by art than > by nature.Quintilian, Institutio oratoria, XI, ii, 17-22, Loeb Edition > English translation by H. E. Butler Frances A. Yates, in her work on the art of memory, examines the information available on Metrodorus' memory techniques at some length. She cites the following passage from an older article on ancient memory systems: > I suspect that Metrodorus was versed in astrology, for astrologers divided > the zodiac not only into 12 signs, but also into 36 decans, each covering > ten degrees; for each decan there was an associated decan-figure. Metrodorus > probably grouped ten artificial backgrounds (loci) under each decan figure. > He would thus have a series of loci numbered 1 to 360, which he could use in > his operations.

The Tokyo Comedy Store was founded in 1994 as the \\"Tokyo Comedy Club\\" by Kevin Burns. Burns gathered together stand-up comics and a hypnotist by placing many ads in the Tokyo Classifieds (now called The Metropolis), calling for performers. The first show was held at the Tokyo American Club, and the second at the British Club in Ebisu, Tokyo. Roughly around the same time a separate group called the Tokyo Cynics started an all stand-up comedy show in the Takadanobaba area at a bar called The Fiddler. By about 1998, Burns was no longer involved, and from that time up until the mid-2000s the group was run first by Nick Abrahams, then Michael Naishtut, who had been independently performing improv comedy in Tokyo, and Chris Wells, one of the founding members of TCS. Naishtut was also hosting the \\"Tokyo Cynics\\" shows, and the two groups were effectively merged. Around the same time, the name was changed to the \\"Tokyo Comedy Store\\". Since then, the Tokyo Comedy Store has held multiple shows every month at various venues. Venues come and go, and so over the year shows have come and gone, or moved locations, but there were usually between three and six shows running at any one time. Other shows around Tokyo had been organized by Dave Gutteridge, who since the early 2000s had been a show runner, performer, and administrator of the website. Some shows involved stand-up, some involved improv, and some involved both. The cornerstone show continues to be held on the last Friday of every month and featured stand-up comedians in the first half until 2015. The second half of the show consisted of an entirely improvised comedy by \\"Spontaneous Confabulation\\" (known as \\"Spontaneous Confusion\\" until 2010), the resident improv troupe. The show usually ended with music-based improvisation. In 2015 the cornerstone show was rebranded ‚ÄùThe TCS Improvazilla Show‚Äù and changed to an all-improv format. The standup performers now perform at several different venues around town, including through Standup Tokyo. The TCS Improvazilla Show now features a long-form montage based on audience responses to a monthly changing question, an audience member interview, or a spoken word performance in the first act, and a long-form musical in the first act. These are called ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs on Your Mind?‚Äù and ‚ÄúMusical Premiere‚Äù, respectively. The performers are now referred to as simply ‚Äúthe Improvazilla cast.‚Äù The a musical Premiere is done in various genres throughout the year, including a 1940‚Äôs love story for February‚Äôs Valentine‚Äôs Day special, and a zombie-themed musical in October for the Halloween Special. Currently the director of the Tokyo Comedy Store is Chris Wells, who runs the Improvazilla show at the Crocodile live-house in Shibuya, attracting audiences of around 80, the vast majority of whom are non- Japanese, as well as the TCS School of Improv and Acting at Studio Gokko, a black box theatre and workshop space in Shibuya-Ku , which opened in April, 2019. The school offers improv and acting lessons in Japanese, English and Spanish on a daily basis. At about the same time the Tokyo Comedy Store was first founded in 1994, Jun Imai started to teach improvisation classes for Japanese performers and stage improv performances as \\"in the moment\\". In 2004, he brought the In The Moment improv troupe to TCS and produced the first ITM + TCS shows, which were based entirely on improvised comedy. These became known as TCSj (Tokyo Comedy Store Japanese), and the group performed twice a month in the same venue as the English version through 2011. TCSj cut down on their shows in 2012, and now perform several times a year at the Crocodile and other venues, under the rebranded name TCD:D. Although it features the same type of improvised scenes as the English show does, it has several different show formats with different casts. Currently TCS:D has a cast of over 20 improvisors. Jun Imai directs improvised and scripted plays at Studio Gokko and teaches improv and acting classes there on a weekly basis. He is the author of five volumes on improvisation, including the long-selling ‚ÄúJiyu ni naru no ha taihen na no da: Impro Manual‚Äù (It‚Äôs Tough to be Free: Impro Manual). TCS directors Chris Wells and Jun Imai teach internationally, and have been invited to teach at improv conferences in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and the Americas.  Tokyo Comedy Store film  A documentary film about the Tokyo Comedy Store was made and released on DOC: The Documentary Channel in 2008. The film is a narrative account of director Brian C. Anderson's experience performing with the stand-up comedians of the Tokyo Comedy Store. Anderson's film explores the differences between Eastern and Western styles of comedy, and showcases various acts he encounters as he progresses as a stand- up comedian in Tokyo. Anderson made the film while stationed overseas in the United States Air Force.

For the literary and epigraphic testimonia pertaining to the Altar, see Agora III, 203, 363-378, 698 (Wycherley, pp. 78, 119-122, 210-211), and Long pp. 62-72. The Altar was set up by Pisistratus the Younger, (the grandson of the tyrant Pisistratus) during his archonship, in 522/1 BC. It marked the central point from which distances from Athens were measured and was a place of supplication and refuge. The exact identities of the twelve gods to whom the Altar was dedicated is uncertain,Camp 1980, p. 17. but they were most likely substantially the same as the twelve Olympian gods represented on the east frieze of the Parthenon: Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Apollo, Artemis, Hephaestus, Athena, Ares, Aphrodite, Hermes, and Dionysus,Garland, p. 41 though there are reasons to suppose that Hestia may have been one of the twelve.Seaford pp. 79 ff.. It was formerly thought that during the Roman period, the Altar became known as the Altar of Pity (Eleos), however that altar is now believed to have been located further east in the Roman Agora.Gadbery, p. 478, Long, p. 162. See Vanderpool. The altar was dismantled c. 267 AD.Long, p. 163. Construction The Altar was set up by Pisistratus the Younger--the son of Hippias, and the grandson of the tyrant Pisistratus-- during his archonship.Crosby, p. 82; Wycherley, p. 119; Camp 1980, p. 17; Long, p. 62 (T 14 A), 159; Gadbery, pp. 449-450; Camp 2003, p. 8; Rutherford, pp. 43-44; Seaford, p. 79; Neer and Kurke, pp. 534-535. The fifth century historian Thucydides gives the following account of the dedication of the Altar and its subsequent modification:Thucydides, 6.54.6-7, :\\"Among others who thus held the annual archonship at Athens was Pisistratus, a son of the tyrant Hippias. He was named after his grandfather Pisistratus, and during his term of office he dedicated the altar of the Twelve Gods in the Agora, and another altar in the temple of the Pythian Apollo. The Athenian people afterwards added to one side of the altar in the Agora and so concealed the inscription upon it; but the other inscription on the altar of the Pythian Apollo may still be seen, although the letters are nearly effaced. It runs as follows: ‚Äî :::'Pisistratus the son of Hippias dedicated this :::memorial of his archonship in the sacred precinct :::of the Pythian Apollo.' The dedication has thus been dated to 522/1 BC, the most probable date for the archonship of Pisistratus the Younger, while the expansion of the Altar, noted by Thucydides above, has been dated to the last third of the fifth century BC,Crosby, p. 99; Gadbery, p. 450. thus probably during the Peloponnesian War..Long, p. 162. Geographic center From at least the 5th century BC, the Altar became the zero point from which distances to Athens were calculated.Crosby, p. 82; Wycherley, p. 119; Camp 1980, p. 17; Long, p. 159; Gadbery, p. 447; Camp 2003, p. 8; Rutherford, pp. 43-44. A milestone, c. 400 BC, found near the gate to the Acropolis reads: \\"The city set me up, a truthful monument to show all mortals the measure of their journeying: the distance to the altar of the twelve gods from the harbor is forty-five stades\\".Camp 2003, p. 8; Long, pp. 64-65 (T 14 I); Wycherley, p. 121 no. 374; Inscriptiones Graecae, II2 2640. The historian Herodotus, writing c. 440 BC, tells us that the distance from Heliopolis to the sea is similar to the distance \\"from the altar of the twelve gods at Athens to the temple of Olympian Zeus at Pisa.\\"Herodotus, 2.7.1. Pindar may have been referring to the Altar of the Twelve Gods and its central status, as is supposed by many scholars,How and Wells, 6.108.4; Wycherley, p. 122 no. 378; Sourvinou-Inwood, pp. 91-92; Wilson, p. 315 note 34; Rutherford, p. 43; Seaford, pp. 79-80; Neer and Kurke, pp. 530, with n. 4, 534. when (probably sometime during the first half of the fifth century BC) he wrote:Pindar, fr. 75 Maehler [= 75 Snell, 68 Bowra] (Race, pp. 318-321); Wycherley, p. 122 no. 378. For a detailed discussion of the fragment see Neer and Kurke. They argue, pp. 535 ff., that the Altar of the Twelve Gods, erected by Pisistratus in 522/1, was located in the old Agora, to the east of the Acropolis, and later relocated to the new Agora, northwest of the Acropolis, during the fifth century BC. According to this view, Pindar here would then be referring to the Altar in the old Agora. ::\\"Come to the chorus, Olympians, ::and send over it glorious grace, you gods ::who are coming to the city's crowded, incense-rich navel ::in holy Athens ::and to the glorious, richly adorned agora.\\" Possibly as early as its founding, the Altar may have been the zero point from which the herms, erected by Hipparchus, marked the halfway points of the roads from Athens to its demes.Long, pp. 159-160\\\\. For the herms see Harrison, pp. 112-114; [Plato?], Hipparchus 228d-229a . Dionysia The Altar apparently had played some role in the City Dionysia. Pindar's quote may be in reference to the Dionysia,Sourvinou-Inwood, pp. 96-98; Wilson, p. 315 n. 34; Rutherford, p. 43; Seaford, p. 79; Neer and Kurke, pp. 531-533, 535. and Xenophon mentions that during the Dionysia choruses performed dances in honor of the Twelve, presumably at their Altar during the Dionysia procession:Sourvinou-Inwood, pp. 91-92; Wilson, p. 315 n. 34; Garland, p. 41. ::\\"As for the processions, I think they would be most acceptable both to the gods and to the spectators if they included a gala ride in the market place. The starting point would be the Herms; and the cavalry would ride round saluting the gods at their shrines and statues. So at the Great Dionysia the dance of the choruses forms part of the homage offered to the Twelve and to other gods.\\"Xenophon, Hipparchicus 3.2. Supplication and refuge The Altar also functioned as a place of supplication and refuge.Gadbery, p. 447; Camp 1980, p. 17; Wycherley, p. 119; How and Wells, 6.108.4. In 519 BC, when the Plataeans came to Athens seeking protection from Thebes,Gadbery, pp. 448-449; Wycherley, p. 119 no. 365; Thucydides, 3.68.5. according to Herodotus, while \\"the Athenians were making sacrifices to the twelve gods, they [the Plataeans] sat at the altar as suppliants and put themselves under protection.\\"Herodotus 6.108.4. In 431 BC, as the result of accusations of the misappropriation of public funds involving Pericles and the sculptor Phidias, some of Phidias's assistants probably sat as suppliants at the Altar.How and Wells, 6.108.4; Wycherley, p. 119; Long, p. 63 (T 14 D); Diodorus Siculus, 12.39.1; Plutarch, Pericles 3.2. According to Wycherley, \\"the text is doubtful ... but may be taken as it stands with reference to the altar of the Twelve.\\" And, shortly before his execution at Athens (in about 355 BC), the Athenian general Callistratus took refuge there as well.Wycherley, p. 120 no. 366; Long, pp. 63 (T 14 C), 160; Lycurgus, Against Leocrates 93. Modern discovery The exact location of the Altar within the Classical Agora, unspecified in ancient sources, was discovered through excavations, in 1891 and 1934, at a site just opposite the Stoa of Zeus, and adjacent to the Panathenaic Way, which connected the Agora with the Acropolis.Crosby, pp. 82-85 fig. 2; Gadbery, pp. 447, 448 fig. 1; Neer and Kurke, pp. 539-540, 541 fig. 2. Two short sections of wall were uncovered in 1891, during construction of the Athens-Piraeus Electric Railway.Crosby, p. 82; Gadbery, p. 447. In 1934 during excavations conducted by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens in the Agora, to the south of the railway, the southwest corner of an enclosure was discovered, which was identified as the continuation of the sections of wall discovered in 1891.Crosby, p. 82. Also discovered abutting the west wall, was a Pentelic marble statue base inscribed on its front:Gadbery, p. 447, Plates 105, 106:b; Neer and Kurke, pp. 540-541, 544 fig. 5; Long, pp. 64 (T 14 G), 160, fig. 130; Wycherley, p. 122 no. 378; Camp 1980, p. 17; Inscriptiones Graecae, I3 950 [= Agora I no. 1597]. :Leagros, son of Glaukon, dedicated [this] :to the Twelve Gods thus identifying the enclosure as that of the Altar of the Twelve Gods.Neer and Kurke, pp. 540-541; Gadbery, p. 448; Long, pp. 160, 161; Wycherley, p. 122 no. 378. As of 1992, \\"nearly nine-tenths\\" of the Altar lay buried beneath the Athens-Piraeus Electric Railway, with only the southwest corner of the enclosure visible.Gadbery, pp. 447, 449 Fig. 2; Plates 106:a, 109:b. More of the Altar was uncovered by Greek archaeologists in 2011 when the train tracks were temporarily removed for maintenance work.Neer and Kurke, p. 540; \\"Altar of the Twelve Gods sees the light\\", 2/17/2011. ekathimerini.com. Retrieved on 2011-02-21. Once the Altar was exposed, archaeologists and a group promoting the revival of ancient Greek polytheism filed legal injunctions to prevent replacement of the tracks of the Athens- Piraeus Railway. The court ruled that public transportation needs prevailed, and the Altar was covered up again in August 2011.\\"Railway works halted until August\\", 5/2/2011. ekathimerini.com. Retrieved on 2013-05-10. Reconstruction The Altar's rectangular enclosure or peribolos, was roughly square, 9.5m per side, with its north-south axis oriented just to the west of north. A parapet wall surrounded a paved enclosure containing a rectangular altar proper, presumably at its center. The parapet had a central opening to the west, into the agora, and probably another central opening to the east opening onto the Panathenaic Way.Gadbery, pp. 459, 460 fig. 11; Long, p. 160. For an illustrated reconstruction, see Camp 2003, p. 8 fig. 7. Four three- figure reliefs with mythological subjects, known only from copies, perhaps decorated the parapet enclosure.Long, p. 162. Other literary and epigraphic testimonia When the Athenian herms were mutilated in 415 BC, according to Plutarch, a man castrated himself on the Altar.Long, pp. 63-64 (T 14 E), 160; Wycherley, p. 120 no. 366; Plutarch, Nicias 13.2. The mutilation of the herms, occurred during the Peloponnesian War, just before the Athenian fleet was to set sail for Syracuse at the start of the Sicilian Expedition, see Thucydides, 6.27. A fifth-century dedication by a victorious athlete at the Nemean and Isthmian Games,Long, pp. 65 (T 14 K), 162; Wycherley, p. 121 no. 371; Inscriptiones Graecae, I2 829. and two fourth-century dedications, one by the Athenian trierarch, Philippos, son of Iasodemos,Long, pp. 65 (T 14 K), 162; Wycherley, p. 122 no. 376; Inscriptiones Graecae, II2 4564. the other by the Athenian Boule,Long, pp. 70 (T 16 F), 162; Wycherley, p. 121 no. 375; Inscriptiones Graecae, I2 2790. have been associated with the Altar. A bronze statue of Demosthenes was erected near the Altar in the \\"archonship of Gorgias\\", probably in 280/279 BC.Long, pp. 64 (T 14 F), 160; Wycherley, pp. 164 no. 533, 170 no. 559, 210-211 no. 698; Pseudo-Plutarch, Vitae decem oratorum (Lives of the Ten Orators) 8, 11. Pausanias, 1.8.4 locates the statue near the Temple of Ares. References to the Altar cease after the 3rd c. BC.Long, p. 162. A second-century AD inscription indicates a reserved seat for the priest of the Twelve Gods in the Theater of Dionysus.Long, pp. 72 (T 16 I), 162; Wycherley, p. 122 no. 377; Inscriptiones Graecae, II2 5065.

The George Washington Carver Museum is a museum located in Tuskegee, Alabama, United States. It is a part of the Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site. The museum, located on the campus of Tuskegee University, is managed by the US National Park Service, with self-guided tours. The George Washington Carver Museum has several exhibits, including crop rotation theories that helped the Southern United States's economy boom, and the history of George Washington Carver himself. Overview The museum consists of many exhibits, interpretive programs, a book sales area and two introductory films on George Washington Carver and Booker T. Washington, and are available at the museum. The museum was developed with substantial support from admirer and industrialist Henry Ford. Carver wanted the fruits of his life's work on display at the museum. He hoped that the exhibits would inspire children to live better lives. The original museum was housed in a remodeled building and was filled with Carver's geological and mycological (fungus) specimens made over a lifetime. Carver's artwork and crafts were also displayed in the museum. Mounted regional bird specimens and giant vegetables preserved in jars that he used as \\"show and tell\\" at farm and county fair demonstrations became part of the museum. Carver first served as Director of the Agricultural Department where he developed agricultural extension services for black farmers and homemakers. Milbank Hall was the site of his agricultural experiments. His last laboratory was housed in the Carver Museum. Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) donated the home of Booker T. Washington and the Carver Museum to the National Park Service in 1977, and much of the Carver collection in 1979.Exhibits, National Park Service, USA. History For more than forty years, Dr George Washington Carver labored at Tuskegee Institute. He was the son of a slave woman, whose owner was named Moses Carver.George Washington Carver, Biography.com. Carver remained on Moses' estate until he was 12 years of age. He would paint pictures of flowers, plants, and landscapes. He never ceased efforts to improve the living conditions and surroundings of rural and farm people - particularly those who lived in the South - and to extract from nature through scientific research those elements and resources which could be made useful for the benefit of mankind. Many honors came to him during his lifetime, but none gave him more genuine pleasure and satisfaction than his own museum. It was always his wish that everything he did would be available to the public for the general good of all. The George Washington Carver Museum was authorized by the trustees of Tuskegee Institute in 1938 at the request of President Frederick D. Patterson. The Museum, formerly the school laundry, housed Dr Carver's extensive collections of native plants, minerals, birds and vegetables; his products from the peanut, sweet potato and clays; and his numerous paintings, drawings, and textile art. The Museum was formally dedicated by Mr and Mrs Henry Ford in 1941. In January 1943, Dr Carver died and was buried in the Campus Cemetery. In 1947, a fire caused great loss in the Museum. Fortunately, many of Dr Carver's products were not seriously damaged. However only a few of his paintings were saved, those mostly damaged by smoke and water. When the building was renovated in 1951, it was enlarged to include a basement exhibit area. With a total area of , it became a general repository for historic and modern treasures donated to Tuskegee Institute or removed from campus buildings. The Museum also held an extensive collection of African crafts and artifacts. Over 300 bound volumes and rare pamphlets of south, central and west coast Africa, and more than 1000 photographs of life in Ghana and Nigeria were included. Between 1951 and 1962, Bess Bolden Walcott served as the curator of the Museum. Her work as a curator of the museum led to its becoming a National Park Service site. The Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site was authorized in 1974 and established on November 13, 1977. The George Washington Carver Museum, along with the Booker T. Washington home \\"The Oaks,\\" was then deeded to the people of the United States. Both the Museum and The Oaks (the home of Booker T. Washington) were closed to the public in February 1980 to undergo restoration and refurbishing. Restoration was the focus for the Museum's exterior. The building's interior was gutted and rebuilt to house exhibits, artifact storage space, staff offices, an auditorium where audiovisual programs are conducted, and an elevator for disabled persons. Exhibits The main exhibit area of the Museum is divided into two sections. One section focuses on the comprehensive career of Dr Carver. Within this area is some of his laboratory equipment, including salvaged parts of discarded equipment with which he set up his first laboratory. Dr Carver had begun his research with only one true piece of scientific equipment: a microscope. Also included are samples of peanut and sweet potato products. The exhibits of his paintings, embroidery and needlework interpret the artistic talents of Dr Carver. On display are plaques, medals and artistic work created in tribute to Dr Carver. The second section of the Museum leads the visitor through the growth and development of Tuskegee Institute, founded in 1881, to the present day Tuskegee University. Through photographs and artifacts, the exhibits outline the school's accomplishments through extension work and the compilation of statistics on Black life are interpreted. Returning visitors from the 1940s through the 1970s will note a smaller number of artifacts on display. It has not been necessary to exhibit several hundred extra items in order to provide a comprehensive interpretive experience. Items not on display are stored in a controlled environment. Ownership of a large selection of African artifacts formerly displayed in the Museum was retained by Tuskegee University.

Kashmir 1947: Rival versions of History David Taylor in a scholarly review of Prem Shankar Jha's Kashmir, 1947: Rival Versions of History observes that the Indian journalist who was also an information adviser to the Indian Prime Minister tackles Alastair Lamb's positions about the Mountbatten-Indian Government collaboration over Kashmir. Taylor states that while Jha does not totally rebut Lamb's positions he provides \\"plausible alternative readings\\" to some of the arguments he had raised. Taylor also sees that Jha treats Hari Singh more sympathetically than other writers. Robert Wirsing points out that Jha's book is \\"laced with partisanship\\" and that he exaggerates the strength of his conclusions. Wirsing observes that Jha's research is not sufficient support for the sweeping claims he makes. Wirsing states that while challenging Pakistan's version of events Jha has failed to delivered a knockout punch to Pakistan.

It consists of 20 elected representatives. The primary function of the Authority is to strengthen the economic, social and cultural development of the peoples of the Torres Strait area. The Torres Strait Territory Coalition was formed in 2010, with the aim of gaining official Territory status for the Torres Strait Islands. The plan would see the TSRA and local governments in the area abolished, but this has not come to pass. The islands The Torres Strait Islands lie to the north of Tropical Queensland's Cape York Peninsula and comprise 274 small islands, of which 17 are inhabited, located in Torres Strait which separates Australia and Papua New Guinea (PNG). Each island community elects a member to the Torres Strait Regional Authority. Thursday Island (Waiben) and Horn Island (Nurupai) are the most well-known of the Torres Strait Islands. Activities on the islands are quite traditional, with fishing being the major economic activity. To travel to the remote islands (other than Thursday and Horn Islands) permission is required from the Torres Strait Regional Authority.Queensland Destinations ‚Äì The Torres Strait Islands. Tourism Queensland. The five major island groups of the Torres Strait include: * Northern Division (Boigu, Dauan, Saibai) * Eastern Islands (Darnley, Murray, Stephen) * Western Division (St. Pauls, Kubin, Badu, Mabuiag) * Central Division (Yorke, Coconut, Warraber, Yam) * Southern Division (TI and Inner Islands, NPA and Mainland Australia) History of the TSRA The authority was established in 1994, as a separate authority from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), in order to deliver better services and programs to the Torres Strait Islander people living on the Islands. Together with the Island Co-ordinating Council (ICC), the TSRA has been active in implementing community based management strategies. The adoption of a Marine Strategy for the monitoring and management of dugong and turtle populations in the seas around the islands was undertaken in 1999. A 2001 evaluation found that employment and housing were the two areas of greatest need for improvement, being even worse than that of Torres Strait Islander people on the mainland and Australian Aboriginal people. However, in most other areas, such as health, cultural integrity and crime, the people on Islands fared better. The TSRA's 2001 Bamaga Accord,which proposed a new regional governance framework for the Islands, was an expression of the people's aspiration to have greater autonomy. In 2006, successful lobby by the authority and the ICC resulted in the granting of $300,000 from the Federal Government to study the risks of climate change on the six largest Torres Strait Islands. In 2010, after a nine-year legal battle, the TSRA made a successful native title claim to 40,000 km¬≤ of sea between Cape York Peninsula and Papua New Guinea. This was the largest native title claim in Australia's history. The Torres Strait Territory Coalition was formed in 2010, with the aim of gaining official Territory status for the Torres Strait Islands. The plan would see the TSRA and local governments in the area abolished. Governance The TSRA consists of 20 elected representatives, with its primary function being to strengthen the economic, social and cultural development of the peoples of the Torres Strait area.

He is a right-handed opening batsman who currently plays for Nottinghamshire and the England cricket team. He made his One Day International debut against India in August 2014 and his Test cricket debut against South Africa in December 2015. His attacking style has made him one of the best Twenty20 batsmen in the world. Hales is the first English batsman to score a T20I century. He is also the first batsman to be dismissed for 99 in an ODI and a T20I. Background Hales was born in Hillingdon and attended both Westbrook Hay School and Chesham High School (now Chesham Grammar School) in Buckinghamshire. His father Gary broke several local batting records (including 321 not out for Gerrards Cross versus Chalfont St Peter in a limited overs league match) while his grandfather Dennis was a talented tennis player who once forced Rod Laver to five sets at Wimbledon. Domestic career  County cricket  Hales first came to national attention in 2005 when, as a sixteen-year-old, he hit 55 off a single over (three no-balls, eight sixes, one four) in a Cricket Idol T20 tournament at Lords. Ironically, he had been picked for his fast bowling ability. Hales first represented Buckinghamshire in Minor Counties cricket during the 2006 season, and played for MCC Young Cricketers in the Second XI Championship of 2007. He then impressed whilst trialling with Nottinghamshire in 2007, scoring 218 in only his second appearance for the county, following it up with a hundred and two 95s. Notts offered him a two-year contract until the end of the 2009 season. He made his List A debut in a rain-affected match against Leicestershire in May 2008 and his first-class debut against Somerset in September 2008. During the 2009 season, after an impressive start, he signed a new two-year contract extension.Hales extends Trent Bridge deal BBC Sport.

After just one season on the county circuit he was named in an England Performance Programme squad in the 09/10 winter. In the 2011 summer he was selected for the England Lions against Sri Lanka and was chosen for all the matches.  2011‚Äì2012 India, West Indies and World T20  Following an impressive year in domestic Twenty20, he was selected for the senior England squad to play India. He scored a two-ball duck on debut, however in the following series against the West Indies, he scored an unbeaten 62 in a 128-run stand with Craig Kieswetter as England won by 10 wickets. Hales kept his place in the side for the T20 match against India, but only scored 11 runs off 19 balls. On 24 June 2012, England achieved their highest successful chase in Twenty20 internationals. Hales was man of the match, after scoring 99 before losing his wicket to a yorker bowled by Rampaul with the game almost won. Hales played in both games against South Africa, making scores of 11 in both innings, although he remained unbeaten in the second as the match was rained off. Alex Hales is the only batsman to be dismissed for 99 in a T20I innings. Now an integral part of England's T20 team, Hales played in the 2012 ICC World Twenty20. England beat Afghanistan to qualify from the group, with Hales being run out on 31. However, England were bowled out for 80 in the next game against India. In the super 8 stage, Hales again batted well against the West Indies, scoring 68.In that match against West Indies he along with Eoin Morgan set the record for the highest 4th wicket partnership in ICC World T20 history(107). After beating New Zealand, England lost to Sri Lanka, with Hales being dismissed for just 3, meaning England were knocked out of the tournament.  2013‚Äì2014 New Zealand, Australia and T20 World Cup  Hales played in all three T20 games against New Zealand, now batting with his county teammate Michael Lumb. He made scores of 21, 5 and 80. In the third match of the series, in which Hales made 80, he participated in a 143 opening partnership with Lumb as England won by 10 wickets. In the return series Hales made 39 before the final match was abandoned. Hales made 94 in the second match against Australia, as he consolidated his position at the top of the ICC player rankings. Hales was less effective in the away series in Australia, scoring 22, 16 and 6. He was then selected in the limited overs tour of West Indies, where he was also expected to play in his first ODI. However, injury meant he could only play in the T20 series, where he made scores of 3, 40 and 38. England were drawn in a tough group for the 2014 World T20. Hales made a second ball duck in the first match against New Zealand, but followed this up by an unbeaten 116 against Sri Lanka. In doing so he became the first Englishman to score a T20I century. In that same match he along with Eoin Morgan set the record for the highest 3rd wicket partnership in T20 World Cup history(152). However, although Hales made 38 against South Africa, England lost and were knocked out of the competition. They then suffered a humiliating defeat against the Netherlands in their final match, in which Hales made 12 as England were bowled out for 88. 2014 Sri Lanka and India Hales kept his place in the team for Peter Moores first game in charge of the T20 side against Sr Lanka. Although England lost, Hales top scored with 66. Hales made his long-awaited ODI debut in the series against India. He started well, making scores of 42 and 40 in his first two games although England went on to lose them both. In the final two games of the series, he could only manage scores of 6 and 4 as England lost the series 3-1. He returned to form in the only T20 match between the two sides, hitting 40 to help England win the game. He was selected in the squad for the series against Sri Lanka, but was surprisingly dropped for the first two games. He made 27 when he was recalled for the third ODI, batting in the middle order. In the fourth ODI he replaced suspended captain Alistair Cook at the top of the order, but was dismissed for a first ball duck. He made seven in the final match of the series. 2015 World Cup Hales was overlooked for the start of England's World Cup campaign and did not play until the must-win game against Bangladesh. He made 27 as England lost the game to go out of the tournament. He played in the final game against Afghanistan, making 37 as England won the match by nine wickets. 2015 New Zealand Hales was included in the squad for the five- ODI series at home against New Zealand. He scored 20 in the first match, but England went on to win by 210 runs. In the second ODI Hales performed more strongly, scoring 54 off 49 balls, but England lost by 13 runs in a close match. England lost the third ODI by 3 wickets, with Hales making 23. In the fourth ODI Hales scored 67 off 38 balls as England won by seven wickets. In the final game of the series, Hales was out for just one, but England went on to win the game by three wickets and the series 3-2. He made 27 as England won the one off T20 match between the two sides. 2015 Australia In the only T20 between the two sides, Hales made just three, but England went on to win the game by five runs. Hales had a poor start to the ODI series, scoring 22 in the first game and 18 in the second, as England lost both games to go 2-0 down in the series. However, England won the third game, despite Hales continuing to struggle for form. In the fourth match, Hales was out for a duck, but England chased down Australia's total of 299 to level the five match series 2-2. Hales poor series ended with a score in 4 in the final game, which England lost to hand the series to Australia. 2015 Pakistan Despite being included in the Test squad to face Pakistan, Hales did not play in any Tests. He came into the side for the ODI series, and made in ten as England lost their opening game. He ended his poor run of form in the second match of the series, scoring 109 as England won by 95 runs. He made a score of 30 in the next match as England recorded a six wicket win to go 2-1 up in the series. England won the final game of the series, with Hales making a score of 22, to help England to a 3-1 series win. 2016 South Africa In the one- day series again Pakistan in the UAE, BBC Sport commentator Jonathan Agnew stated that Hales' technique was simply too fallible outside off stump, planting his front foot on middle stump and playing with a bat two feet away from his body. Agnew surmised that whilst in 20 and 50 over cricket with no slips Hales could get away with this issue, in test cricket he could not. In the first three tests in South Africa, Hales' technique was cruelly exposed by their fast-bowling attack. In the first Tests he made scores of 10 and 26, although England went on to win the game by 241 runs. In a high scoring second Test, Hales made 60 in the first innings but was dismissed for just five in the second. In the third Test, he was out for one in the first innings as England made 323. He was out for 18 in the second innings, as England went onto secure a seven wicket victory. In the final match of the series, he again struggled, and after making 15 in the first innings, he was out for just one in the second innings as England were bowled out for just 101. Despite the heavy defeat, England won the series 2-1. However, in the ODI series, Hales returned to form in spectacular style. He scored 4 consecutive fifties and a century to garner Man of the Series. In the first ODI, Hales scored 57 off just 47 balls to put behind the poor Test series. He then went on to score 99 in the second ODI falling just short of his second ODI century. He continued this great form in the third ODI scoring 65 off 73 balls in a losing effort. In the fourth ODI, he scored yet another half-century scoring 50 off 56 balls in another losing effort. In the final ODI, he finally scored his second and well-deserved ODI century, scoring 112 off 128 balls finishing the series with 383 runs overall and the series highest run-scorer. In the T20 series Hales scored 27 in the first game which England lost, before making a score of 16 in England's final match before the T20 World Cup, in which England were comprehensively beaten by nine wickets. 2016 T20 World Cup Hales made a score of 28 in England's opening game defeat against the West Indies, before making 17 in a historic run chase against South Africa. After missing the third game against Afghanistan through injury, Hales returned for the crucial game against Sri Lanka, and although he was out for a duck, England won the game. He made 20 in the semi-final against New Zealand as England booked their place in the final, but he was out for just one against the West Indies as England finished as runners-up. 2016 Sri Lanka Hales retained his place in the test team for the Sri Lanka series, but after much debate by the selectors. He repaid their faith in the first test at Headingley by scoring 86, and sharing a century partnership with Jonny Bairstow when England were in trouble. England went on to win the match by an innings and 88 runs. In the first innings of the second test he again gave himself a good start of 83, but failed to reach his first Test century. He was out for just eleven in the second innings as England secured a nine wicket victory. In the third and final test at Lord's, Hales scored just 18 runs in the first innings, but made a brilliant 94 in the second innings, and was dismissed lbw by Angelo Mathews just six runs short of a place on the honours board. The third match ended in a draw, with England winning the series 2-0. Hales made just 4 in the first ODI against Sri Lanka, as the match ended in a tie, with both teams posting 286. In the second match he made 133 not out and was involved in a record breaking partnership with Jason Roy as England won by ten wickets after reaching 256/0. In the third match he was out for a duck in a rain affected match, and did not bat in the fourth match which England won, due to injury. The injury ruled him out of the final match of the series, which England won to take the series 3-0. 2016 Pakistan Hales was out for six in the first innings in the first Test against Pakistan, and then made 16 in the second innings as England lost by 75 runs. England won the second Test, although Hales only scored 34 runs in the match. After scoring 17 in the first innings of the third Test, Hales scored 54 in the second innings to help England turn the game around and win by 141 runs. Hales again struggled in the final Test, scoring just six in England's first innings as they were dismissed for 328 and just 12 in the second innings, as England suffered a ten-wicket defeat and drew the series, 2‚Äì2. Hales made scores of seven and 14 in the first two ODIs as England went 2-0 up in the series. In the third ODI Hales achieved the highest ever individual ODI score posting 171 during the third ODI against Pakistan on his home soil at Trent Bridge. The record was previously held by Robin Smith for 23 years. Hales' ton helped England achieve the highest ever team ODI score in the same game with England posting 444-3, bettering the previous record of 443 by Sri Lanka back in 2006 against the Dutch at Amstelveen. England won the match by 169 runs as well to seal the series. In the fourth ODI Hales made eight as England chased down Pakistan's target of 248 to go 4‚Äì0 up in the series. In the final match, Hales could only manage 23 as England lost their first game of the series, with it finishing 4-1. Hales top-scored for England with 37 in the only T20I between the two sides, but England lost by nine wickets. 2017 India After missing the series against Bangladesh due to safety concerns, Hales played in the first ODI against India and made nine in England's total of 350 runs, although England lost by three wickets. In the second ODI he made 14 as England lost by 15 runs. Injury ruled Hales out of the rest of the series. 2017 West Indies Hales missed the first two matches against the West Indies through injury, but returned in the final game, making 110 as England made 328 and won by 186 runs. 2017 Ireland Hales scored 55 from 47 balls in the 1st ODI in a modest chase of 127 which England accomplished in 20 overs and made 32 of 35 balls in the 2nd ODI which England also won by 8 runs. 2017 South Africa Hales started well in the ODI series with 61 off 60 balls in a 72 run for England in the 1st ODI, however, he could only make 24 off 28 balls in the next match and would follow it up with a 2-ball 1 in the 3rd ODI where England were bundled out for a poor 153. He made 47 off 38 balls in the first T20 and then was not in the squad for the 2nd T20, although he came back for the 3rd T20 where he scored 36 from 28 balls. 2017 Champions Trophy He started off the tournament sublimely with a blazing 86-ball 95, although missing out on a hundred, his good form continued with 56 from 62 balls against New Zealand, however, he was bowled for a duck in the last group stage encounter against Australia and could only make 11 against Pakistan in the semi final which England lost. 2019 Cricket World Cup In April 2019, he was named in England's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. However, two days after the England squad was named, Hales made himself unavailable for Nottinghamshire's fixture against Lancashire in the 2019 Royal London One-Day Cup citing \\"personal reasons\\". Nottinghamshire posted a statement on their website stating that no timetable had been made for his return to cricket. On 26 April 2019, it was confirmed that Hales had failed a drugs test for use of a recreational drug, and had been banned for 21 days. On 29 April 2019, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced that Hales had been dropped from England's preliminary World Cup squad and all England squads ahead of the international season. Domestic T20 Leagues  Indian Premier League  On 14 March 2015, Hales signed for Mumbai Indians for the final match of the regular season and the knockout stages replacing injured Corey Anderson. However he ended his short stint without making a single appearance for the side. After going unsold at the 2018 IPL Auction, on 31 March 2018, it was announced that Hales would join Sunrisers Hyderabad for the 2018 season replacing David Warner. Hales made his IPL debut against Rajasthan Royals on 29 April 2018 and scored 45.  Other leagues  Hales was picked by Islamabad United in 2018 Pakistan Super League Draft. On 1 December 2018, Hales hit a record 87 not out off just 32 balls playing for Maratha Arabians. On 25 January 2019 Alex struck his first BPL century off 47 balls for the Rangpur Riders In September 2019, he was named in the squad for the Durban Heat team for the 2019 Mzansi Super League tournament. In July 2020, he was named in the Barbados Tridents squad for the 2020 Caribbean Premier League.  Controversy  In September 2017, Hales, along with teammate Ben Stokes, was charged with bringing the game into disrepute by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). The charge related to an incident that took place outside a Bristol nightclub, in September 2017, several hours after England had played a one-day international against the West Indies at the County Ground in the city. Stokes was charged with affray over the incident by police and the ECB deferred its disciplinary hearing until the legal proceedings had finished. In December 2018, the Cricket Disciplinary Commission reached a verdict in response to Hales's behaviour in Bristol and in relation to \\"inappropriate images\\". The Commission banned Hales for six white-ball matches, two of which had been served and the remaining four were suspended. Hales was also fined ¬£17,500, ¬£10,000 of which was suspended for 12 months. Hales was also required to undertake \\"appropriate training\\" at his own cost. In April 2019, Hales tested positive for a recreational drug as he underwent a hair follicle test. According to a report published by the Guardian, Hales was subjected to a ban by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for 21 days as it was his second violation along with his removal from England's squad in the 2019 Cricket World Cup and all squads ahead of the international season. Hales's ban followed him pulling out of Nottinghamshire's Royal London One Day Cup campaign due to \\"personal reasons\\".

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grade Oak Leaves was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership - for the fighter pilots, it was a quantifiable measure of skill and combat success. At the time of his presentation, it was Germany's highest military decoration. Siegfried Schnell was killed in action on 25 February 1944 against the Soviet Narva offensive shot down by an opposing fighter. Wartime career A keen glider- pilot, he joined the Luftwaffe in 1936, and by the start of the war in 1939, he was a Feldwebel serving with 4. Staffel of Jagdgeschwader 2 \\"Richthofen\\", named after the World War I fighter ace Manfred von Richthofen.For an explanation of Luftwaffe unit designations see Organisation of the Luftwaffe during World War II. Stationed on the western border, he saw very little action until the campaign in France started in May 1940. He got his first victory, a French Bloch 152 fighter on 14 May. He was particularly successful in the Battle of Britain and on 7 November off the Isle of Wight, as operations were slowing down and recently commissioned as a Leutnant (on 1 November), he scored his 20th victory. For this feat he was awarded the Knight's Cross, on 9 November. The focus of the airwar shifted in the next year to the Eastern Front, however Schnell stayed with JG 2 defending the West. On 24 June 1941, only 2 days after the opening of Operation Barbarossa, he was appointed as Staffelkapit√§n (Squadron leader) of 9./JG 2. Soon after, he shot down nine Supermarine Spitfires in just two days (8 ‚Äì 9 July) to reach his 44th victory and was immediately awarded the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, at the time being one of the top pilots in Jagdgeschwader 2. He continued to score consistently as the Royal Air Force (RAF) mounted heavier strikes into France, and temporarily held command of III. Gruppe from 9 December 1941 to the following 28 January while Kommandeur Hans \\"Assi\\" Hahn was on leave. He scored his 52nd (?) victory on 12 February while his unit provided cover for the Kriegsmarine battlecruisers making their 'Channel Dash' back to their ports in Germany. Over the Dieppe Raid on 19 August 1942, he shot down five Spitfires to reach his 71st victory. After that his scoring rate slowed down as he focussed more on administration and command, and he led his unit in the changeover onto the new Focke Wulf Fw 190‚Äîa very rugged dogfighter. In a misguided idea by High Command to rotate the fighter Gruppen between Western and Eastern Fronts, III./Jagdgeschwader 54 (JG 54‚Äî54th Fighter Wing) was transferred from Russia back to Germany for Defence of the Reich. Hauptmann Schnell, now with 80 victories, was given command of the unit on 1 May 1943 to train and lead the pilots in high-altitude interception rather than the low-level brawling they were used to on the Eastern Front. On 11 January 1944 he shot down 3 B-17 bombers to reach 90 victories. On 1 February 1944 he was given command of IV./JG 54, based near Leningrad, and he arrived on 11 February. As mentioned above, command transfers between fronts were rare, given the markedly different combat conditions, and unfortunately Schnell was not lucky to be able to adapt quickly enough. After less than a month and only 3 further victories, he was shot down and killed in his Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-6 (Werknummer 411675‚Äîfactory number) over the Russian offensive for Narva on 25 February 1944. Posthumously promoted to Major, Siegfried Schnell flew over 500 combat missions and ended with 93 confirmed victories, including 12 4-engined bombers. His tally of 90 on the Western Front made him the 11th most successful pilot over the Western Allies.

Widom, Theory of Phase Equilibrium, J. Phys. Chem. 1996, 100, 13190-13199 This definition is clearly parallel to the definition of an ordinary critical point as the point at which two-phase coexistence terminates. A point of three-phase coexistence is termed a triple point for a one-component system, since, from Gibbs' phase rule, this condition is only achieved for a single point in the phase diagram (F = 2-3+1 =0). For tricritical points to be observed, one needs a mixture with more components. It can be shownibid. that three is the minimum number of components for which these points can appear. In this case, one may have a two-dimensional region of three-phase coexistence (F = 2-3+3 =2) (thus, each point in this region corresponds to a triple point). This region (F=2, P=3) will terminate in two critical lines of two-phase coexistence; these two critical lines (F=1, P=2) may then terminate at a single tricritical point. This point (F=0, P=1) is therefore \\"twice critical\\", since it belongs to two critical branches. Indeed, its critical behavior is different from that of a conventional critical point: the upper critical dimension is lowered from d=4 to d=3 so the classical exponents turn out to apply for real systems in three dimensions (but not for systems whose spatial dimension is 2 or lower).  Solid state  It seems more convenient experimentally to consider mixtures with four components for which one thermodynamic variable (usually the pressure or the volume) is kept fixed. The situation then reduces to the one described for mixtures of three components. Historically, it was for a long time unclear whether a superconductor undergoes a first- or a second-order phase transition. The question was finally settled in 1982. If the Ginzburg-Landau parameter \\\\kappa that distinguishes type-I and type-II superconductors (see also here) is large enough, vortex fluctuations become important which drive the transition to second order. The tricritical point lies at roughly \\\\kappa=0.76/\\\\sqrt{2}, i.e., slightly below the value \\\\kappa=1/\\\\sqrt{2} where type-I goes over into type-II superconductor. The prediction was confirmed in 2002 by Monte Carlo computer simulations.

The song became more popular in its live extended recording from Chapin's 1976 concert album, Greatest Stories Live that started the phrase \\"Harry, it sucks.\\" The song is based on an actual truck accident that occurred in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 1965. Incident On March 18, 1965, a 33-year- old truck driver, Eugene P. Sesky, was on his way to deliver a load of bananas to Scranton, Pennsylvania. Sesky, an employee of Fred Carpentier‚Äîoperator of a small truck line in Scranton‚Äîwas returning from the boat piers at Newark, New Jersey, where he had picked up his load. The load was destined for the A&P; produce Warehouse in South Side. Sesky was driving a 1950s Brockway diesel truck tractor with a semi-trailer and was headed down Rt. 307 when he lost control. That section of Rt. 307 contains a two-mile descent extending from Lake Scranton to the bottom of Moosic Street that includes a drop in elevation of more than in less than . Sesky was unable to control the truck's speed down the hill due to a mechanical failure, variously attributed to the truck's brake system or its clutch. As a result, the truck cruised into Scranton at approximately , sideswiping a number of cars before it crashed into a house at the southwest corner of Moosic St and S. Irving Ave (), close to the bottom of the hill. Witnesses reported that Sesky did everything possible to avoid pedestrians and other motorists, including climbing out onto the truck's running board to try to warn people, and some have suggested that he may have deliberately flipped the truck over to avoid striking either bystanders or an automotive service station on Moosic Street that could have exploded in flames, causing a greater loss of life. Sesky was thrown from the truck and killed and bananas were spilled and strewn when the rig came to rest; 15 others were injured but only Sesky died. The road was closed for cleanup as Johnson's Towing Company helped out in the recovery. Trucks over 21,000 lbs were required to go down the hill in first, low gear. Trucks over 21,000 lb (10.5 t) are no longer allowed to travel that route (they must use Interstate 380 via Dunmore). Song The song portrays a fictional account of the incident played in the form of a country song. With each verse, the song gets faster to, as Chapin explained in the live recording, \\"build up intensity and excitement.\\" During the chorus, Chapin sings the phrase \\"thirty-thousand pounds\\" followed by Big John Wallace singing the bass line \\"of bananas.\\" During concerts, the audience was encouraged to shout this refrain. Content A young truck driver is driving \\"just after dark\\" during his \\"second job\\" to deliver a load of bananas to Scranton, which is described as a \\"coal-scarred city where children play without despair in back-yard slag piles,\\" the population of which consumes about of bananas daily. While approaching Scranton, he passes a sign he \\"should have seen\\" reading: \\"Shift to low gear or fifty-dollar fine, my friend,\\" because he is too busy thinking about seeing his wife after his trip. He begins to travel down the \\"two-mile drop\\" road to the bottom of the hill. Suddenly, the truck begins to go faster down the hill, and the driver tries to apply the brakes, only to discover that they are not working. He says, \\"Christ!\\" who ironically is \\"the only Man who could save him now\\" as the load of bananas push against the truck causing it to pick up speed. Cruising into Scranton at \\"about ninety miles an hour,\\" he almost strikes a passing bus. The driver then prays twice to God to make the event all a dream before he \\"sideswiped nineteen neat-parked cars / Clipped off thirteen telephone poles / Hit two houses, bruised eight trees / And Blue- Crossed seven people.\\" He is killed and decapitated in the accident, and of the hill is smeared with his load of bananas. The song's epilogue tells the story how Chapin first heard of the event aboard a Greyhound bus coming out of Scranton some months later. An old man sitting next to Chapin implores him to imagine \\"30,000 pounds of mashed bananas.\\" Many details in the song correspond closely to the actual incident, but others are invented or fictionalized. In particular, Sesky was not actually decapitated in the accident. Alternate endings In the live performance from the album Greatest Stories Live, Chapin sings two alternate endings to the song he originally had in mind, explaining to the audience that the rest of the band was less than enthusiastic about them, with his brothers Tom and Steve each offering the summary dismissal, \\"Harry, it sucks!\\" The first alternate ending uses the 1923 novelty song \\"Yes! We Have No Bananas\\" as the punchline of the song. The second ending is described by Chapin as a \\"country-western\\" ending about \\"motherhood\\", because the song \\"already had a truck.\\" It deals with a young mother crying while watching her child sleeping. The woman is presumably the truck driver's widow and, because of her sorrow over the accident, \\"though she lives in Scranton, Pennsylvania / she never, ever eats bananas.\\" During concerts, Chapin divided the audience during this ending, usually turning it into a contest between men and women with regard to singing skill. The second alternate ending has everyone sing \\"of Bananas!\\" in harmony, swelling to a climax and cutting off. A third alternate ending surfaced later, in which Chapin would often introduce with a monologue about Donny and Marie Osmond, and the technical definition of the word \\"sucks\\". The third alternate ending is a parody of a Chiquita banana commercial, done in \\"Jimmy Buffett style,\\" with the participation of the whole band. The ending is cut short by Big John singing the first verse of \\"Taxi\\" in the form of an upbeat disco style that concludes with Chapin telling him \\"it sucks.\\" The Bottom Line CD features the four endings along with \\"Final Concert.\\" Other recorded examples of the song with all four endings include performances at Knoxville Memorial Stadium on March 7, 1979; the Coffee Break Concert broadcast on WMMS Cleveland on December 5, 1979; and the Boston University concert on April 1, 1981. \\"Harry, it sucks\\" became a popular catchphrase among Chapin's fans, to the point where T-shirts sporting the phrase would be offered at his concerts.

The gunfight Frank Loving was a 19-year-old youth at the time of the fight. Although often referred to as being a gunman, that reputation did not develop until after this gunfight. Loving had come to Dodge City from Texas, arriving the year before and settling into the gamblers life of the busy cattle town. He'd married, became friends with Long Branch owner Chalkey Beeson, and become associated with several notable gunmen, gamblers and lawmen of the day, including Doc Holliday, Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, John Allen, as well as Levi Richardson. Levi Richardson had a tough disposition and was disliked by most, but did get along fairly well with Bat Masterson. He had a reputation as a gunman, despite it being mostly hearsay. In early 1879, Loving quarreled with Richardson, claiming that Richardson was making unwanted and disrespectful advances toward his wife, Mattie Loving. The two threw taunts back and forth for a time, but with nothing more than verbal confrontations until March, when the two became involved in a fist fight on Front Street. After exchanging punches, Richardson exclaimed \\"I'll blow the guts out of you, you cockeyed son of a bitch.\\" Loving, not being armed, simply turned and walked away. On April 5, 1879, Richardson had evidently had enough. He strode into the Long Branch Saloon, specifically looking for Loving. However, Loving was not there at that time. Richardson then settled into a game of poker, and around 9:00 p.m. Loving strode in. Loving took a seat at a long table, at which point Richardson moved over and sat across from him. The two men could be heard talking low to one another, but what was said could not be understood. Suddenly, Richardson said loudly \\"You wouldn't fight anything you damned son of a bitch,\\" to which Loving said calmly \\"Try me and see.\\" Richardson stood and drew his gun, which prompted Loving to do the same. Both men began firing, with Richardson firing five rounds and Loving firing six. When the shooting stopped, Richardson had been shot in the chest, the side, and the arm. Loving was grazed on the hand by one bullet, but otherwise was uninjured. Town Marshal Charlie Bassett quickly responded, having heard the shots, but his Deputy Marshal Duffey arrived first, taking hold of Richardson, just before he crumpled to the floor. No one else in the saloon was injured, and Loving was arrested per standard procedure in such a case. On April 7, 1879, a coroners inquest ruled the shooting self defense, and Loving was released without charges. The newspaper The Globe later reported \\"It seemed strange that Loving was not hit, except for a slight scratch on the hand, as the two men were so close together that their pistols almost touched each other.\\" External links *Long Branch Saloon Gunfight *Frank Loving *Dodge City Shootout, Long Branch Saloon Long Branch Saloon Gunfight Long Branch Saloon Gunfight Long Branch Saloon Gunfight Category:April 1879 events ","title":"Long Branch Saloon gunfight"},{"id":"17732004","text":"Frederick Willis Culpitt (9 May 1877, in Southwark St Saviour, London ‚Äì 1944 in Wandsworth, in London) was an English stage magician and magic inventor.\\"Fred Culpitt and his Creations\\". Retrieved 3 June 2016. He achieved stage success in the early part of the 20th century with a comedy magic act and is also notable as the first magician to appear on a regularly scheduled television show. Culpitt got his first big break when the American \\"chinese- style\\" magician Chung Ling Soo booked him for a tour of Australia in 1909. Between 1914 and 1918 Culpitt replaced David Devant at St. George's Hall, London, performing as a \\"magical comedian\\". Culpitt is credited with inventing the Doll's House Illusion, the Costume Trunk Illusion and the Silk To Egg Trick, which continue to be used by magicians. He is also credited with devising methods for the Torn and restored newspaper trick and various other effects that have become a part of the stage magic repertoire. In 1936 the BBC began test broadcasts from Alexandra Palace, London, for the world's first regular television service. In an effort to find material that would work well on the new medium the corporation sought entertainment acts that had a strong visual element. Culpitt was recruited to present magic, thus helping to establish a lasting place for magic in television variety programming. Also in 1936, Culpitt appeared in the film Keep Your Seats, Please, which starred George Formby. According to the British Film Catalogue, Culpitt, in a small supporting role, played a magician.

Biography The son of a judge graduated in 1914 at the Berlin College of Mines (Bergakademie). Homebeound from the United States at the outbreak of World War I he was arrested by the British Armed Forces at Gibraltar. On an attempt at flight Friedensburg was severely injured, resulting in a long-term stay in hospital. Not able-bodied for military service he served at the German embassy in Bern until the end of the war. Back to Berlin he joined the German Democratic Party (DDP) in 1920 and in 1921 became district administrator (Landrat) at Rosenberg, Marienwerder (today Susz, Poland). In 1925 Friedensburg was appointed vice president of the Berlin state police agency and in 1927 became region president of the Prussian Regierungsbezirk Kassel. As a supporter of the Republican Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold his times in office were marked by fierce conflicts with the rising forces of the Communists and the Nazi Party. By September 1933 he was dismissed from state service. In June 1945 Friedensburg was among the founders of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin. After the elections of October 1946 he became a deputy mayor of the city council under Otto Ostrowski and remained in that office when Louise Schroeder succeeded Ostrowski on 8 May 1947. After the Soviet blockade of the western sectors had begun on 24 June 1948, Schroeder fell seriously ill and had to proceed to Hamburg for medical treatment. Friedensburg as her deputy from 14 August acted as mayor until on 30 November the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) backed by the Soviet authorities proclaimed a separate city council of East Berlin under Friedrich Ebert and hindered Friedensburg from entering his bureau in Mitte. Though Schroeder officially reassumed office the next day, the elections called for 5 December could only be held in West Berlin and resulted in Ernst Reuter becoming mayor of West Berlin. Friedensburg continued his political career as a member of the Bundestag (1952‚Äì1965) and of the European Parliament (1958‚Äì1965).

Background After the capture of Valdivia, Lord Cochrane departed, leaving Colonel Jorge Beauchef as commander and governor of Valdivia. Beauchef decided to head south in order to secure Osorno, to expel the remains of the royalist forces from the Chilean mainland and to take possession of the area south to the Maull√≠n River, so that the Spanish would not be able to reoccupy Valdivia by land. His main worry was a possible regrouping of the Royalist forces in the area, since they far outnumbered his own. Previous to this battle, all the royalists garrisons that had managed to escape from the cities of Valdivia and Osorno gathered at the Carelmapu Fort. The governor of Chilo√© Brigadier Antonio de Quintanilla was disgusted with the poor performance of the old colonel Manuel Montoya and replaced him with Gaspar Fern√°ndez de Bobadilla and captain Miguel de Senosiain, and ordered them to return north and combat the patriots. Bobadilla and Senosiain re- crossed the Maull√≠n River at the head of 300 soldiers. The battle On March 6, Colonel Beauchef sent an advanced scouting group of 50 soldiers under the command of captain Jos√© Mar√≠a Lab√©. As the scouting party was advancing south, they were attacked by the royalists, who ambushed them from a forest near the Hacienda El Toro. Lab√© managed to maintain his ground for about an hour answering the fire, but finally started to retreat overwhelmed by the numerically superior enemy. The royalists came out of their shelters and started to closely pursue the patriots, who by then were in full retreat. When Beauchef heard the shots, he decided to intervene with the 90 soldiers under his command, while allowing Labe's troop to move to his rear, in order for them to rest and recharge his ammunition. The Royalist were then left to face the fresh and entrenched patriot forces, who faced them with increased firepower. As they didn't know how big were Beauchef's forces, they became discouraged and demoralized, and halted their attack. Beauchef immediately seized the opportunity and ordered a frontal bayonet counter-charge with all the forces under his command, causing the Royalists to flee. The patriots, using the horses captured to the enemy began an implacable persecution. The Spanish royalists left the field, leaving behind 40 dead, 106 prisoners and 140 guns and most of their ammunition. Beauchef lost 11 soldiers and had 29 injured.

He was also a leading member of the Plymouth Brethren in Melbourne, Victoria.  Background and career  Born in Bridport, England, Bastow studied architecture in nearby Dorchester, at the same time as Thomas Hardy, later a noted author, was apprenticed to local architect John Hicks. In about 1860, he emigrated to Tasmania, where he won a competition for a new Hobart Town Hall in 1861 (not built). In 1866 he moved north to Melbourne, Victoria and became a draughtsman with the Victorian Water Supply Department, and later, architect and civil engineer with the Railways Department. He returned to Tasmania in 1867 to marry Eliza Litchfield, daughter of a previous Hobart mayor. Following the passing of the Education Act in 1872, which provided for free, compulsory and secular primary school education in Victoria, hundreds of schools were required. Bastow was appointed Architect and Surveyor of the newly formed Education Department, responsible for their design and construction. In 1873, a competition was held for designs for schools of different sizes, from which a number were awarded prizes. Few of these designs were built exactly as submitted, instead Bastow adapted them to differing sizes and sites, adding details, and designed many more himself. Nearly all the early schools were in a similar Victorian Gothic Revival style, usually picturesque, but some symmetrical, with walls of face brick, usually brown, a few in bluestone, with highlights in contrasting brickwork, pointed arch windows, steep slate roofs, prominent gables, some with jerkinhead roofs, and a small bell tower, usually over the entrance. A range of much smaller, simpler rural schools, sometimes on timber, were also designed, also in this Gothic idiom. Schools of the later 1870s and the 1880s were more elaborate, with polychrome brickwork, Gothic traceried windows and prominent towers, some with a more Queen Anne or Tudor character. By the early 1880s, the department had built over 600 schools across Victoria, and a large majority are still functioning as schools. At least 25 of the schools designed by Bastow are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. In 1883, the architecture branch of the Education Department became part of the Public Works Department, and Bastow became a senior architect within the department, working on a wider variety of public buildings, as well as schools. In 1886 Bastow became the chief Government Architect of the Public Works Department in Victoria, a position he held until 1890. In the later years of his tenure, the architects of the Public Works Department produced designs in a wider range of styles than earlier decades, which were marked by simplicity and restraint.  Latter years  Following his departure from that position, he retired from public life to central Victoria, built a simple home equipped with a meeting room for his Brethren fellows, and became an apple orchardist. He continued a correspondence with Thomas Hardy on personal and religious matters.

McK, Annand, 'George O'Brien, 3rd Earl of Egremont, as Colonel of the Sussex Yeomanry, 1798', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Vol XLVI, No 185, Spring 1968, pp. 31‚Äì2. * Petworth Cavalry * Henfield Cavalry * West Hoathly Cavalry * Forest Row Cavalry, with a detachment at Ashdown Other Troops were soon added: * Hastings Cavalry, raised 26 July 1794 as an independent troop, regimented by 1802 * Rye Cavalry, raised 31 July 1794 as an independent troop, regimented by 1802 * Midhurst Cavalry, raised 24 November 1794, with a detachment at Cowdray * Lewes Cavalry, raised 3 June 1795, with a detachment at Coombes * Parham Cavalry, raised 8 October 1795 by Sir Cecil Bisshopp, 8th Baronet. It usually exercised at his estate at Parham Park, drilling in the gallery of the house when the weather was wet. The troop reached a strength of 80 officers and men.Maj A. McK, Annand, 'Sir Cecil Bysshopp, Bart. (later 12th Baron Zouche) and the Parham Troop of Sussex Yeomanry, c. 1798', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Vol XLV, No 181, Spring 1967, pp. 17‚Äì23. * Rape of Chichester Cavalry, raised 17 June 1797, with a detachment at Watergate * Eastbourne Cavalry, raised 20 June 1798, with a detachment at Willingdon * Ashburnham Cavalry, raised 27 June 1798 * Brightling Cavalry, raised 27 June 1798 with a detachment at Rose Hill In 1794, the Churchwardens of the Lewes Visitation pledged to raised the 'Sussex Churchwardens' Corps' with blue uniforms, but in the event the troop was never formed.Barlow & Smith, p. 6. A Yeomanry artillery troop, the Duke of Richmond's Light Horse Artillery was raised by Field Marshal Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond on 15 June 1797 at his estate at Goodwood House. The Duke was a proponent of Horse artillery, and the troop was equipped with his own design of Curricle gun carriage, pulled by four horses (two of which were ridden), with three gunners sitting on the carriage. The troop consisted of two sections and was armed with two 3-pounder guns and two 4.5-inch Coehorn mortars.Barlow & Smith, p. 7. The Treaty of Amiens in 1802 saw most of the Yeomanry disbanded, leaving six troops in Sussex (Petworth, West Hoathly, Midhurst, Lewes, Parham and Chichester). The peace was short-lived and Britain declared war on France again in May 1803, beginning the Napoleonic Wars. The Sussex Yeomanry Cavalry was quickly reformed, including the following additional troops: * Firle Cavalry, raised 28 July 1803 * Ringmer Cavalry, raised 2 September 1803 * Rye Cavalry, reformed 1 October 1803 * Goodwood Artillery Troop, reformed 15 October 1803 * Ashburnham Cavalry, reformed 17 November 1803 By 1806, there was also a cavalry troop forming part of the North Pevensey Legion, but this was raised under the Volunteer Act of 1804 and did not form part of the Yeomanry. The Sussex Cavalry (three troops) and Sussex Guides were raised in 1803, but these were probably also Volunteers. For a while, the Yeomanry and infantry volunteers were combined to form the Sussex Legion, but the Volunteers were disbanded at the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and the Yeomanry reverted to their previous title. 19th Century The Yeomanry declined in importance and strength after the end of the French wars,Spiers, p. 79. and by 1817 only three of the original troops (Petworth, Lewes and Midhurst) survived, joined by a new West Coast Troop raised at Yapton on 30 July 1816. However, a new Goodwood Troop of Yeomanry Artillery was raised on 19 October 1817 by Charles Gordon-Lennox, Earl of March and Darnley (later 5th Duke of Richmond). The unit consisted of four detachments, each of one gun with two pairs of horses, two sergeants and eight gunners. At an inspection in Goodwood Park in 1824, the troop marched past with four 3-pounders (possibly the same guns laid up by the earlier troop) and an ammunition wagon. The troop was disbanded in December 1827. The remaining troops of Sussex Yeomanry were disbanded when government support was withdrawn in 1828.Beckett, p. 52. However, a wave of civil unrest across Britain from 1830 led to a revival of the Yeomanry. The Petworth Troop was reformed on 28 March 1831 and the Sussex Yeomanry Cavalry was reformed as a regiment on 18 May that year, with its HQ at Arundel and the following organisation:Barlow & Smith, pp. 5‚Äì6. * Petworth Troop, disbanded by 1843 * Arundel and Bramber Yeomanry Cavalry (two troops), disbanded 1848 In 1871, the 1st Sussex Light Horse Volunteers were formed at Brighton, but these were part of the post-1859 Volunteer Force and not Yeomanry. They were disbanded in 1875.Beckett, pp. 70‚Äì72; Appendix X. Second Boer War Following a string of defeats during Black Week in early December 1899, the British government realised that it would need more troops than just the regular army to fight the Second Boer War. On 13 December, the decision to allow volunteer forces serve in the field was made, and a Royal Warrant was issued on 24 December. This officially created the Imperial Yeomanry (IY). The force was organised as county service companies of approximately 115 men, and volunteers (usually middle and upper class) quickly filled the new force, which was equipped to operate as Mounted infantry.Rogers, p. 228.Spiers, p. 239.Dunlop, pp. 104‚Äì18.IY at Anglo-Boer War. The first contingent of 20 IY battalions arrived in South Africa between February and April and upon arrival were sent throughout the zone of operations. 69th (Sussex) Company, Imperial Yeomanry, disembarked in South Africa on 24 April 1900, and initially served in 14th Battalion, IY, transferring to 7th Battalion in 1902.IY Companies at Roll of Honour.Amery (1909), Appendix to Chapters I-XIV, pp. 503‚Äì14. On 14 June 1901, approval was given for a new regiment of Sussex Imperial Yeomanry (all Yeomanry were designated Imperial Yeomanry from 1901 to 1907) to be formed under the command of Lt-Col Charles Wyndham, 3rd Baron Leconfield of Petworth, a former officer in the 1st Life Guards. The returned veterans of 69th (Hampshire) Company formed the cadre for the new regiment, which had the following organisation:Army List, various dates.Barlow & Smith, pp. 7‚Äì15. * Regimental HQ (RHQ) at 10 Great College Street, Brighton, moving to 26 Silwood Street in 1902 and Church Street in Autumn 1913 * A Squadron at Hove * B Squadron at Lewes * C Squadron at Chichester * D Squadron at Hastings and Rye, later at Eastbourne Enlistment for the new unit began on 1 October, and by 2 April 1902 69 men had been sent to South Africa to join the various IY companies still serving there. By the time the regiment carried out its first training camp at Lewes, in May 1902, it had a strength of 413. Territorial Force The Imperial Yeomanry were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908.London Gazette, 20 March 1908.Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. The Sussex Yeomanry (TF) were organised as follows:Sussex Yeomanry at Long, Long Trail.Sussex Yeomanry at Regimental Warpath.Conrad, British Army 1914. * RHQ at Drill Hall, Church Street, BrightonBrighton at Drill Hall Project. * A Squadron at Brighton, with detachments at Horsham, Worthing, Haywards Heath and Crawley * B Squadron at Lewes, with detachments at Burgess Hill, Eridge, Brighton, Uckfield, Tunbridge Wells and Haywards Heath * C Squadron at Chichester, with a detachment at Bognor * D Squadron at Eastbourne, with detachments at St Leonards, Bexhill and Rye The Sussex Yeomanry formed part of the TF's South Eastern Mounted Brigade. World War I Mobilisation Charles Gordon-Lennox, Earl of March (later 8th Duke of Richmond) in the uniform of the Sussex Yeomanry. The Sussex Yeomanry were mobilised on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914 under the Charles Gordon-Lennox, Earl of March, DSO, who had only taken command on 3 July.Burkes. Under the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9), which brought the TF into being, it was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, after the outbreak of war, TF units were invited to volunteer for 'Imperial Service'. On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way, duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. Later, a 3rd Line was formed to act as a reserve, providing trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line regiments.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6.  1/1st Sussex Yeomanry The 1st Line regiment went to its war station at Canterbury (under Second Army of Central Force)) until September 1915. It was dismounted and left Kent for Liverpool; on 24 September, it boarded RMS Olympic and sailed the next day. It arrived at Lemnos on 1 October. The regiment landed in Gallipoli on 8 October and was attached to the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division. Within days of the landing the Regiment reported many men suffering from enteritis. While at Gallipoli they spent time in the trenches at Border Barricade and Fusilier Bluff. On 30 December it was evacuated to Mudros with 42nd Division; it left the Division at Mudros on 2 January 1916. The brigade, with the regiment, was withdrawn to Egypt in February 1916 and formed part of the Suez Canal Defences. On 22 February, South Eastern Mounted Brigade was absorbed into the 3rd Dismounted Brigade (along with the Eastern Mounted Brigade). The brigade served as part of the Suez Canal Defences from 14 March to 26 July attached to 42nd (East Lancashire) Division; it then joined the Western Frontier Force. By the end of the year, it was back on the Suez.3 Dismounted Bde at Regimental Warpath. The brigade was with the Suez Canal Defences when, on 14 January 1917, Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) Order No. 26 instructed that the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Dismounted Brigades be reorganized as the 229th, 230th and 231st Brigades. The brigade units were reorganized in January and February 1917. As a result, the 1/1st Sussex Yeomanry was converted to infantry at Mersa Matruh on 3 January 1917 and redesignated 16th (Sussex Yeomanry) Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment.Barlow & Smith, pp. 15‚Äì16.Becke, Pt b, pp. 117‚Äì22.Royal Sussex at Long, Long Trail. On 23 February, the GOC EEF (Lt-Gen Sir A.J. Murray) sought permission from the War Office to form the 229th, 230th and 231st Brigades into a new division. The War Office granted permission and the new 74th (Yeomanry) Division started to form. The 230th Brigade joined the division at Deir el Balah between 9 and 13 April. The battalion remained with 230th Brigade in 74th (Yeomanry) Division for the rest of the war. With the 74th Division, the battalion took part in the invasion of Palestine in 1917 and 1918. It fought in the Second and Third Battles of Gaza (including the capture of Beersheba and the Sheria Position). At the end of 1917, it took part in the capture and defence of Jerusalem and in March 1918 in the Battle of Tell 'Asur. On 3 April 1918, the Division was warned that it would move to France and by 30 April 1918 had completed embarkation at Alexandria.74th Division at Long, Long Trail. In May 1918, the battalion landed at Marseilles, France with 74th (Yeomanry) Division. It served in France and Flanders with the division for the rest of the war. By 18 May, the division had concentrated around Rue in the Abbeville area. Here the dismounted Yeomanry underwent training for service on the Western Front, particularly gas defence. On 14 July 1918, the Yeomanry Division went into the line for the first time, near Merville on the right of XI Corps. From September 1918, as part of III Corps of Fourth Army, it took part in the Hundred Days Offensive including the Second Battle of the Somme (Second Battle of Bapaume) and the Battles of the Hindenburg Line (Battle of √âpehy). In October and November 1918, it took part in the Final Advance in Artois and Flanders. By the Armistice, it was near Tournai, Belgium, still with 74th (Yeomanry) Division. With the end of the war, the troops of 74th Division were engaged in railway repair work and education was undertaken while demobilisation began. The division and its subformations were disbanded on 10 July 1919.  2/1st Sussex Yeomanry The 2nd Line regiment was formed at Brighton in September 1914 and remained there until May 1915. It then moved to Maresfield and joined 2/1st South Eastern Mounted Brigade; there it took over the horses of 2nd King Edward's Horse who were going dismounted to the Western Front. In October 1915, the regiment was at Canterbury. On 31 March 1916, the remaining Mounted Brigades were ordered to be numbered in a single sequence; the brigade was numbered as 14th Mounted Brigade and joined 4th Mounted Division.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 27‚Äì30. In July 1916, 4th Mounted Division became 2nd Cyclist Division and the regiment was converted to a cyclist unit in 5th Cyclist Brigade at Great Bentley. In November 1916, the division was broken up and the regiment was merged with the 2/1st Surrey Yeomanry to form 8th (Surrey and Sussex) Yeomanry Cyclist Regiment in 3rd Cyclist Brigade at Ipswich. In March 1917, it resumed its identity as 2/1st Sussex Yeomanry at Ipswich, and later moved to the Woodbridge area. In April 1918, the regiment moved with 3rd Cyclist Brigade to Ireland, landing in Dublin on 21 April. Initially, it was stationed at Clandeboye and in September 1918 to Boyle; there was no further change before the end of the war.  3/1st Sussex Yeomanry The 3rd Line regiment was formed in July 1915 at Brighton and affiliated to the 3rd Reserve Cavalry Regiment at Canterbury. In the summer of 1916, it was dismounted and attached to the 3rd Line Groups of the Home Counties Division at Crowborough as its 1st Line was serving as infantry. The regiment was disbanded in January 1917 with personnel transferring to the 2nd Line regiment or to the 4th (Reserve) Battalion of the Royal Sussex Regiment at Tunbridge Wells. Between the wars After World War I, the TF was reformed as the Territorial Army (TA). The 14 senior Yeomanry regiments remained horsed cavalry regiments (6 forming the 5th and 6th Cavalry Brigades) while the remaining Yeomanry Regiments were reassigned as artillery. In 1920 the regiment reformed as the 13th (Sussex Yeomanry) Army Brigade, Royal Field Artillery (RFA), but in 1921 this was redesignated 98th (Sussex Yeomanry) Brigade, RFA. Then in 1922 it amalgamated with two batteries newly converted from the Surrey Yeomanry to form 98th (Surrey and Sussex Yeomanry) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery with 389 and 390 (Sussex Yeomanry) Field Batteries, and 391 and 392 (Surrey Yeomanry) Field Batteries. In 1924 it was redesignated 98th (Surrey and Sussex Yeomanry, Queen Mary's) Army Field Brigade, Royal Artillery, and the Regimental Headquarters moved from Brighton to Clapham Park. The regiment was among the 'Army Troops' administered by 44th (Home Counties) Infantry Divisional Area. When the TA was doubled in size following the Munich Crisis, 389 and 390 (Sussex Yeomanry) Batteries left to form a duplicate regiment, 144th Field Regiment, RA at Brighton in 1939. Both regiments were considered to be 'Surrey & Sussex Yeomanry', and 144th received the 'Surrey and Sussex Yeomanry, Queen Mary's' subtitle in 1942.Litchfield, pp. 222, 233; Appendix VII.Titles & Designations 1927.Farndale, Annex K.144 (S&SY;) Fd Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45. World War II 98th Field Regiment (Surrey & Sussex Yeomanry Queen Mary's) ::See main article 98th Field Regiment (Surrey & Sussex Yeomanry Queen Mary's) On mobilisation in 1939, the Regiment was part of the British Expeditionary Force (B.E.F.) that was sent to France, initially attached to the 1st Infantry Division in the Lille area. In May 1940, it would be attached in turn to the 46th and 44th Infantry Divisions during the German advance the regiments Guns and vehicles were caught in a traffic jam and had to be destroyed, with the troops proceeding on foot to Dunkirk for evacuation.98 (S&SY;) Fd Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. Back in the United Kingdom the regiment was attached to the 1st Infantry Brigade while it reformed it remained in the United Kingdom until September 1942 when it was sent out to the Middle East and attached to the 10th Armoured Division in Egypt where it participated in the Second Battle of El Alamein, when 10th Armoured was disbanded the regiment was part of the 8th Army Artillery and served in Sicily and Italy being involved in the Battle of Monte Cassino amongst others before leaving Italy in March 1945 and joining the 2nd Army in France and Belgium ending the war in the Netherlands. In April 1945 the Regiment moved to the L√ºbeck area of Germany as occupation forces and demobilisation was started in October 1945 with the Regiment being placed in suspended animation in June 1946. 144th Field Regiment (Surrey & Sussex Yeomanry Queen Mary's) =Home Defence= 25-pounder and Quad tractor on exercise in the UK. On the outbreak of war in September 1939, the regiment mobilised at Brighton as an Army field regiment in Eastern Command. It was equipped with 12 x 4.5-inch howitzers of World War I vintage, but within days it had handed over eight of these guns to 123 Officer Cadet Training Unit at Catterick Garrison and all its vehicles to 98th (S&SY;) Fd Rgt, which was preparing to go to France with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). In the following weeks, the regiment received 18 x 18-pounder Mk II guns, and 15 assorted civilian vehicles. In December 1939 the regiment supplied a cadre of trained officers and men to provide the basis of a new 74th Medium Regiment that was forming at Preston Park, Brighton (see below).Frederick, p. 738. In April 1940, 144th Fd Rgt went to Dursley in Gloucestershire to join IV Corps, and began to receive modern 25-pounder guns and Quad tractors. By June, when the BEF had been evacuated from Dunkirk without any of its guns, 144th Fd Rgt was one of the few field regiments in the UK with its full allotment of 24 x 25-pounders. It was attached to the Regular Army 4th Division, which was refitting in Hampshire, before returning to IV Corps in August.Eastern Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. =East Africa= The 1941 campaign in Eritrea. After Italy declared war in the summer of 1940, the War Office sent reinforcements to protect the British bases in Egypt, the convoys taking the longer but safer round the Cape of Good Hope to the Red Sea ports. These reinforcements included three field regiments sent before the end of 1940, including 144th (S&SY;). On 16 November, the regiment under Lt-Col H.T.W. Clements landed at Suez, and by 8 December it been taken back to Port Sudan to join 5th Indian Division at Haiya in the Sudan.Farndale, pp. 149‚Äì52.Farndale, Annex G.Playfair, Vol I, pp. 244‚Äì8.Glover, p. 184.Joslen, p. 480.Joslen,p. 508. On arrival, 390 Bty (less F Troop) under the command of Major E.C.R. Mansergh, was sent to Mekali Wells to join 'Gazelle Force' on 11 December. Organised around the divisional motor cavalry regiment (Skinner's Horse) and two motor machine gun companies of the Sudan Defence Force, Gazelle Force under the command of Colonel Frank Messervy had been raiding Italian frontier posts since October, and 390 Bty's 25-pounders replaced an earlier battery of 18-pounders. F Troop, which had been detached to Gebeit, rejoined 390 Bty on 17 January.Glover, p. 51.Playfair, Vol I, p. 397. In January 1941, the British force advanced against Kassala and the Italians withdrew. Gazelle Force was sent in pursuit. On 21 January, it was approaching Keru when D and F Troops of 390 Bty were charged by about 60 Eritrean cavalry led by two Italian officers on grey horses ‚Äì probably the last time British forces faced a cavalry charge. The horsemen were driven off by the guns firing over open sights and gunners of 25th Fd Rgt using rifles. The battery's observation posts (OPs) also drove off enemy infantry and dismounted cavalry who were working round the position. After the enemy had been winkled out of Keru Gorge, a three-day fight for Agordat followed, with the guns supporting infantry fighting their way up steep hills. By 1 February, the advance was continuing at high speed, the guns driving at 35 mph until they were stopped by artillery fire short of Ponte Mussolini on the Barka River. E Troop unlimbered and put the Italian guns out of action with seven rounds. On 3 February, the battery reached the main Italian defensive position at Dongolass Gorge that shut off the Keren Plateau and began shelling the defences.Glover, pp. 55‚Äì70, 74‚Äì6.Playfair, Vol I, pp. 400‚Äì2, 432. Sketch map of the Keren battlefield. Reinforced, Gazelle Force attempted to seize the gorge by scaling the heights either side of it. A company of 2nd Battalion, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, accompanied by a Forward Observation Officer's (FOO) party from 390 Bty, scaled Point 1616 (later known as Cameron Ridge), pushing off defenders of the Savoia Grenadiers. The eight-week Battle of Keren followed. The steep mountainsides caused problems for the OPs and the guns. 'Brig's Peak' and 'Acqua Col' were unsuccessfully attacked. On 10 February, the 4/6th Rapjputana Rifles (the 'Rajrifs') made another assault on the Acqua Col, Major Mansergh and his party going up with the battalion HQ. Despite the battery firing 2816 rounds in the day, the opposition proved too strong for the Rajrifs.Farndale, pp. 152‚Äì4.Glover, pp. 76‚Äì81.Playfair, Vol I, pp. 433‚Äì5. Meanwhile, the rest of the regiment with 5th Indian Division had been fighting hard for Barentu, until the defenders withdrew after the fall of Agordat. Now the force was concentrated to take Keren and regiment was reunited.Farndale, pp. 154‚Äì6.Glover, pp. 70‚Äì1.Playfair, Vol I, p. 436. The regiment came into action in the Hagas Valley at 20.30 on 14 February. All the artillery of two divisions was concentrated against Mount Sanchil on 16 March, and the OP on Cameron Ridge was able to bring down F Trp's fire on enemy reinforcements massing for a counter-attack. That night the OP reported the British and Indian troops were only yards for their objectives. F Troop tried to silence the enemy mortars and 390 Bty continued firing against divisional targets all next day. On 18 March the OP reported that the enemy had recaptured Sanchil, and at 05.15 the next morning the Alpini battalion of the Savoia Grenadiers was seen running down the gorge, until an effective Defensive Fire (DF) task was called down on them.Glover, pp. 107‚Äì13.Playfair, Vol I, pp. 437‚Äì8. Artillery of an Indian division in action at Keren Meanwhile, 389 Bty under Major A.G. Munn was supporting Brigadier Messervy's attack on Fort Dolgorodoc. Munn accompanied 2nd Bn Highland Light Infantry and was wounded, while his signaller won a Military Medal for laying out a telephone line under fire when the radio failed. 144th Field Rgt was in constant action beating off enemy counter-attacks, but was sustaining casualties from return fire. On 25 March 398 Bty engaged and dispersed a force of enemy tanks, but that day a mobile column broke through the roadblock in the Dongolass gorge and Keren fell two days later.Glover, pp. 113-22.Playfair, Vol I, p. 439. Afterwards, 144th Fd Rgt was concentrated with 5th Indian Division in the final push on Addis Ababa. At Amba Alagi on 4 May, 29th Indian Infantry Brigade took a series of hill features while covered by a timed artillery fireplan. The following day, Major Munn accompanied 1st Bn Worcestershire Regiment as they took Middle Hill supported by a powerful artillery attack. Further advance on this line was impossible, but the main Italian force in East Africa surrendered on 19 May.Farndale, pp. 155‚Äì8.Glover, pp. 159‚Äì60, 167‚Äì9.Playfair, Vol I, pp 442‚Äì7. =Tobruk= At the end of the campaign, 5th Indian Division returned to Egypt. 144th Field Rgt sailed from for Suez on 24 June, arriving two days later.Farndale, p. 159 In August, it was preparing defensive positions at El Alamein. Then, in September, it came under the direct command of British Troops Egypt, handed in all its guns and equipment at Alexandria, and the personnel were shipped into the besieged port of Tobruk aboard HMAS Nizam and HMAS Napier on 18/19 September in one of the regular night supply runs by the Royal Navy's Inshore Squadron. At Tobruk, it was attached to 70th Division, replacing the 9th Australian Division which had garrisoned the place during the first part of the siege.Farndale, pp. 204‚Äì5.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 22‚Äì6. On arrival, the regiment took over an assortment of old guns from 2/12th Australian Fd Rgt, which had been the garrison's primary counter-battery unit:Farndale, p. 187. * 389 Bty ** A Trp: 4 x 100mm Italian guns (pre-1914) ** B & C Trps: 4.5-inch howitzers (1904 vintage) * 390 Bty ** D Trp: 18-pounders in the anti-tank (A/T) role ** E Trp: 105mm Italian guns (1914) ** F Trp: 4 x 60-pounders (World War I) The CO, Lt-Col Clements, described these as 'what must have been the most extraordinary collection of junk with which any British regiment went into battle'. In October there was a rearrangement, with E Trp taking over 4.5-inch, D Trp 100mm, B & C Trps 18-pdrs, and RHQ manning Austrian-made 150mm howitzers. 25-pounder and Quad tractor moving up to the front in the Western Desert. On 21 November, 70th Division began its breakout from Tobruk to link up with Eighth Army's Operation Crusader. 144th Field Rgt's FOOs were able to watch the capture of key enemy positions such as 'Tiger', and to direct the 18-pounders of B and C Trps against enemy A/T guns.Farndale, pp. 211‚Äì5.Playfair Vol III, pp. 44‚Äì6. After hard fighting, covered by 144th Fd Rgt, 70th Division broke through and XIII Corps' HQ entered the town on 29 November. Fighting continued: on 30 November, the regiment halted an enemy infantry counter-attack with a DF programme, though one gun of D Trp was knocked out by a direct hit. The full link-up between Eighth Army and the Tobruk garrison was achieved on 5 December, and by 10 December all enemy troops had withdrawn from the perimeter.Farndale, pp. 222‚Äì5.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 48, 53, 61‚Äì4, 78. On 28 January 1942, the regiment came under the command of 4th Indian Division and was re-issued with 25-pdrs. 4th Indian had just retired to the Gazala Line, where Eighth Army dug in during a lull in the fighting.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 147‚Äì8. On 23 February, the regiment came under 1st Armoured Division. The Gazala Line was screened by small mobile columns: 390 Bty formed part of one mobile column until April, and 389 Bty joined 'Mooncol' in April. On 27 April, the regiment reverted to 5th Indian Division at Sollum.Playfair, Vol III, p. 219. =Middle East= 144th (S&SY;) Field Rgt left 5th Indian Division for the last time on 10 May 1942 and was sent to Habbaniyah in Iraq to join Tenth Army. Here, it was joined for a month by 103 Bty from 79th A/T Rgt, in an experimental organisation used in the region.Joslen, p. 515.Farndale, p. 199.Playfair, Vol III, p. 214. On 4 July, the regiment was sent to Aleppo in Syria to join 17th Indian Infantry Brigade, and then on 24 August to Persia to join 31st Indian Armoured Division. It moved with the division into Iraq on 20 November. Royal Artillery field regiments had adopted a three-battery organisation earlier in the war, and 144th Fd Rgt finally reorganised its 24 guns into three batteries (389, 390 and 522) in January 1943. In October 1943, 31st Indian Armoured Division moved to Egypt, apparently to join the Italian Campaign, but this never happened. The regiment served for a while as depot regiment at the Middle East School of Artillery at Almaza. It moved to Palestine with 31st Indian Armd Division on 24 February 1944, and received M4 Sherman tanks as OPs. In May 1944, it was the depot regiment at the Mountain Warfare Training Centre at Bsarma in Lebanon. It remained garrisoning Palestine, Lebanon and Syria for the rest of the war ‚Äì latterly only 390 Bty having guns, the remainder as infantry ‚Äì and saw no further action. 144th (Surrey & Sussex Yeomanry QMR) Field Regiment was placed in suspended animation at Almaza, Egypt, in September 1945. 74th Medium Regiment The cadre that provided the basis for 74th Medium Regiment was supplied by 144th (S&SY;) Fd Rgt, but it was considered a war-formed unit, not part of the TA, and was not granted the Yeomanry subtitle. The cadre was formed on 5 December 1939 and the new regiment came into existence at Preston Park, Brighton, on 2 January 1940. Its two batteries were initially lettered A and B, changing to P and Q on 11 March 1942Frederick, p. 738.Farndale, Annex M. At this stage of the war each battery of a medium regiment would consist of eight guns, either 6-inch howitzers or 60-pounders of World War I vintage.Ellis, Appendix IV.Farndale, p. 4. The regiment was formed too late for the Battle of France, but by the end of 1940 it was serving in XII Corps of Home Forces, stationed in the critical invasion area of South-East England. By March 1941 it had its own signal section of the Royal Corps of Signals and was affiliated to 43rd (Wessex) Division defending East Kent. This continued into 1942, the regiment gaining its own transport platoon of the Royal Army Service Corps and Light Aid Detachment of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, ready for mobile warfare.Collier, Maps 17 & 20.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery, 26 December 1940, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, files WO 212/4 and WO 33/2365.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 25 March 1941, TNA files WO 212/5 and WO 33/2323.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional units), 22 October 1941, TNA files WO 212/6 and WO 33/1883.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional units), 2 April 1942, TNA file WO 212/515.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 14 August 1942, TNA files WO 212/7 and WO 33/1927. In October 1942 the regiment was assigned to First Army preparing for the landings in North Africa (Operation Torch).Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 22 November 1942, TNA files WO 212/8 and WO 33/1962.Joslen, p. 465. On 1 January 1943 the two batteries were numbered as 99 and 110 Medium Btys. 99 Battery of 74th Medium Regiment struggles to bring a 5.5-inch gun into action during the winter fighting at Monte Camino. 74th Medium Regiment served in North Africa with First Army as part of the new style Army Groups Royal Artillery (AGRAs), developed by the gunnery tacticians as powerful artillery brigades, usually comprising three medium regiments and one heavy regiment, which could be rapidly moved about the battlefield, and had the punch to destroy enemy artillery. The first AGRA HQs had been formed in August 1942 and officially sanctioned in November in time for Torch.Farndale, p. 99.Molony, Vol V, p. 451.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 273, 389.Frederick, p. 965. 74th Heavy Regiment served in 2nd AGRA during the Italian Campaign. For example, it fired in support of 201st Guards Brigade attack on 'Bare Arse Ridge' on 6 November during the during the Battle of Monte Camino, and in support of 56th (London) Division during the assault crossing of the Garigliano in January 1944.Joslen, p. 467.Molony, Vol V, p. 608. In February 1944, 2nd AGRA was sent to support the New Zealand Corps. Molony, Vol V, p. 697. By late May, 2nd AGRA, with 74th Medium Rgt under command, was supporting X Corps' advance after Operation Diadem had broken through the German Winter Line, and the subsequent pursuit to Lake Trasimeno and advance to Florence. It continued with X Corps during Operation Olive to breach the Gothic Line.Molony, Vol VI, Pt I, pp. 247‚Äì8.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 1‚Äì5, 76, 225. 2nd AGRA was part of a large concentration of artillery supporting Eighth Army in the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy (Operation Grapeshot).Jackson, Vol VI, p. 222. The regiment was disbanded on 1 December 1945. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the two regiments were reformed as 298th (Surrey Yeomanry, Queen Mary's) Field Regiment, RA and 344th (Sussex Yeomanry) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA. In 1950, the 344th absorbed 605th (Sussex) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA. On 10 March 1955, Anti-Aircraft Command was disbanded and there was a reduction in the number of TA anti-aircraft units. On that day, 344 (Sussex Yeomanry) LAA Rgt merged with 258 (Sussex) LAA Rgt, 313 (Sussex), and 641 (Sussex) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiments to form 258 (Sussex Yeomanry) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA. The former 344 LAA Rgt provided RHQ and P Battery at Brighton to the new regiment. In 1961, this regiment in turn merged with 257 (County of Sussex) Field Rgt to form 257 (Sussex Yeomanry) Field Rgt, with RHQ at Brighton.235‚Äì265 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.289‚Äì322 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.638‚Äì677 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. When the TA was converted into the TAVR in 1967, the regiment was reduced to 200th (Sussex Yeomanry) Medium Battery in 100th (Eastern) Medium Regiment. In April 1993, 200 (Sussex Yeomanry) Battery converted to become 127 (Sussex Yeomanry) Field Squadron, 78 (Fortress) Engineer Regiment Royal Engineers. Although the regiment was disbanded in 1999, the lineage was maintained by 1 (Sussex Yeomanry) Troop, 579 Field Squadron (EOD), part of 101 (London) Engineer Regiment (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) (Volunteers) at Reigate Army Reserve Centre. Uniforms and insignia The several units that made up the Sussex Troops of Gentlemen and Yeomanry in 1794, favoured light cavalry helmets with feather plumes, short dark green jackets with black facings and white breeches. The Arundel and Bramber Troop raised in 1831 followed contemporary Light Dragoon fashion with bell-topped shakos, light blue jackets with red facings and plastron, plus white breeches.Barlow & Smith, pp.2-5. The newly formed Regiment of Sussex Imperial Yeomanry of 1901 wore khaki for both full and service dress, but in both orders with \\"Dublin Fusiliers Blue\\" (a bright shade) for cuffs, collars and trouser stripes. Blue Lancer style plastrons were worn for parade and off duty wear. The headdress for all ranks was a Boer War influenced slouch hat of light drab with bright blue emu feather plumes. In 1909 the khaki full dress was replaced by a bright blue 'Indian Army pattern\\" tunic with black braiding for officers and a plainer blue uniform for other ranks resembling the modern No. 1 Dress of the British Army. Peaked \\"forage caps\\" with yellow bands were the normal headdress, although officers had a special dragoon style spiked helmet with yellow and blue plumes, for Levee wear and other special ceremonial occasions. The plain khaki service uniform of the regular cavalry was adopted in 1909 for ordinary duties.Barlow & Smith, pp.8-15. Between 1922 and 1930, 98th Field Brigade is believed to have worn an embroidered arm badge with '98' over 'Bde' in a circle in red. on a dark blue background. The RA cap badge was at first worn by all batteries of 98th Field Bde, but after 1930 the batteries wore their Surrey or Sussex Yeomanry cap and collar badges as appropriate. This continued during World War II, with both regiments also wearing an embroidered shoulder title with 'SURREY & SUSSEX' over 'YEOMANRY Q.M.R.' in yellow on navy blue. In the Middle East, they wore brass shoulder titles on khaki drill jackets, with 'S&Sx.Yeo;' for 98th Field Rgt and 'SSY' for 144th Field Rgt. After World War II, both regiments retained their respective Surrey or Sussex Yeomanry cap badges and yellow on navy shoulder titles, 'SURREY YEOMANRY Q.M.R.' for 298th Field Rgt and 'SUSSEX YEOMANRY' for 344th LAA/SL Rgt. Surrey & Sussex Yeomanry remembered at the Field of Remembrance, Westminster Abbey, November 2009.

P122 appendix. 'Ermerijc'. In Old High German, the name was conflated with the name Haginrich (from hagin \\"enclosure\\" and rich \\"ruler\\") to form Heinrich.The contribution of Haimirich, Haimrich is more significant than that of the (rarer) Haginrich, Hainrich: \\"In formen wie Hainrich u. s. w. fliessen die beiden namen Haimirich und Gaganrich anz in einander hin√ºber.

F√∂rstemann, Altdeutsches Namenbuch (1856), 593, cf \\"Heinrich\\", nordicnames.de. The Old High German name is recorded from the 8th century, in the variants Haimirich, Haimerich, Heimerich, Hemirih.The spelling Heinrich dates to the 11th century, alongside numerous variants (Heimirich, Heimarih, Heimeric, Haimrich, Heimrich, Heimrih, Hemerich, Hemric, Hemrich, Hemmerich, Aimirich, Heinrich Hinrich, Henric, Henrih, Ainrich, Enerich, Enrich etc.) E. F√∂rstemann, Altdeutsches Namenbuch (1856), 591 Harry, its English short form, was considered the \\"spoken form\\" of Henry in medieval England. Most English kings named Henry were called Harry. The name became so popular in England that the phrase \\"Tom, Dick, and Harry\\" began to be used to refer to men in general. The common English feminine forms of the name are Harriet and Henrietta. It has been a consistently popular name in English-speaking countries for centuries. It was among the top 100 most popular names used for boys born in the United States, England and Wales, and in Australia in 2007. It was the 46th most common name for boys and men in the United States in the 1990 census. Harry, its short form, was the fifth most popular name for boys in England and Wales in 2007 and among the top 50 names in Ireland, Scotland and Northern Ireland in recent years. Harry was ranked as the 578th most popular name in the United States in 2007. It is also in use as a surname (see Henry (surname)). Its variant, Amerigo, was the source from which the continents of Americas were named.

It was a royal name in Germany, France and England throughout the high medieval period (Henry I of Germany, Henry I of England, Henry I of France) and widely used as a given name; as a consequence, many regional variants developed in the languages of Western and Central Europe: Within German, Low German, Frisian and Dutch, numerous diminutives and abbreviated forms exist, including Low German, Dutch and Frisian Heike, Heiko; Dutch Hein, Heintje; German Heiner, Heinz. The original diphthong was lost in Dutch Hendrik (hypocoristics Henk, Hennie, Rik), Scandinavian Henrikfrom an Old Norse *Heinrekr nordicnames.de (whence Henning). Eastern European languages under the influence of German and the Scandinavian languages during the medieval period have developed native forms: Polish Henryk, Czech Jind≈ôich, Hynek. Hungarian, Slovene, Croatian Henrik Finnish Henrikki (hypocoristic Heikki), Lithuanian Henrikas, Lithuanian Herkus. The French form Henri became productive in the British Isles, in Middle English adopted as Harry, Herry. Herry was adopted into Welsh as Perry, in Irish as Annraoi, Anra√≠, Einr√≠ and in Scottish Gaelic as Eanraig, Eanruig. In Southern Europe variants without the initial /h/ include Italian Arrigo, Enrico, Catalan Enric and Spanish Enrique (whence Basque Endika) and Italian Enzo. A separate variant, which may originate with the Old High German name Haimirich, but possibly conflated with the names Ermenrich (first element ermen \\"whole\\") or Amalric (first element amal \\"vigour, bravery\\") is Emmerich. Emmerich is the origin of a separate suit of variant names used across Western and Central Europe, although these never rose to the ubiquity of the variants of Henry; they include English Emery, Amery, Emory, French √âmeric, Hungarian Imre, Imrus, Slovak Imrich, Italian Amerigo and Iberian (Portuguese, Spanish, Galician) Am√©rico, etc. Feminine variants Several variants of Heinrich have given name to derived feminine given names; Low German Henrik, Hendrik gave rise to Henrike, Hendrike, Hendrikje, Hendrina, Henrika etc. Low German Heiko to Heike Italian Enrico gave rise to Enrica ( Enrika, Enriqua) Spanish Enrique to Enriqueta, Enriquetta, Enriquette. French Henri gave rise to Henriette, Henrietta, further modified to Enrieta, Enrietta English Harry to Harriet, Harriett, Harrietta, Harriette, hypocorisms Hattie, Hatty, Hettie, Etta, Ettie; various other hypocorisms include Hena, Henna, Henah, Heni, Henia, Henny, Henya, Henka, Dutch Jet, Jett, Jetta, Jette, Ina; Polish Henryka, Henia, Heniusia, Henka, Henryczka, Henrysia, Rysia. The hypocorisms Rika, Rike (etc.) may be from this or other names with the second element -ric. Spanish and Portuguese Am√©rica from the Emmerich variant Am√©rigo .

Unlike the testaments of his predecessor Pius X and successor John Paul II, it is a very short document, omitting names, details and designations of individual material belongings. Supporters of Pope Pius XII view the testament as a testimonial of his modesty and spiritual holiness.Raomondo Spiazzi, on October 9, 1992 Campo Santo Vaticano It has been quoted at memorial events in his honour and is allegedly a part of the documentation of his beatification process underway in Rome. Noteworthy is the first sentence in Latin: Miserere mei, Deus, secundum (magnam) misericordiam tuam (Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Your great mercy; Psalm 50). When the Pope pronounced these words after his election March 2, 1939, the word magnam was a part of the cited Psalm. However the new 1956 translation left out this word. In order to be correct in his 1939 quote, Pope Pius put (magnam) in parentheses. Text Alternative translation Another translation of the Testament was given by Dorothy Day in Catholic Worker magazine. The naming of faults has an extra phrase: \\"sins committed\\". This is a significant inclusion, knowing Day's admiration of Pius XII (She calls him \\"our dear Holy Father\\" in the article giving the alternate translation). Dropping the strong words \\"sins committed\\" would need to be explained. Also interesting is the translation \\"scandalized\\".

Since 1993, she has been the Director of Public Affairs, representing the Church as its international spokesperson. In 2000 the Los Angeles Times reported that she was a member of the Church of Scientology's Office of Special Affairs (OSA). Career Pouw is a spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology, and the Director of Public Affairs for Church of Scientology International. In 2000 the Los Angeles Times reported that she was a member of the Church of Scientology's Office of Special Affairs (OSA), which she said functions as a \\"public affairs office\\". In 1997 she was a public affairs officer for the Church of Scientology. She resides in Los Angeles, California. Response to criticism of Scientology Pouw has spoken out against activists and former Scientologists who publicly criticize Scientology. When Carnegie Mellon University professor David S. Touretzky spoke to the press about the Scientology-affiliated organization Applied Scholastics, Pouw said: \\"He is discredited in the field that he's trying to comment on. He is a specialist in rat brains.\\" Scientology critic Arnaldo Lerma told The Washington Post that he left the Church of Scientology because he fell in love with one of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard's daughters, but Pouw said Lerma \\"left the Church because he could not maintain the ethical standards required of Scientologists\\". She has also questioned why former Scientologist Lawrence Wollersheim's organization Fight Against Coercive Tactics Network (FACTnet) should have non-profit, tax-exempt status. \\"Wollersheim has been trying to con the church and the general public for 20 years. We recognized him for what he is and expelled him from the church. Now the law has finally caught up with him,\\" she said after United States Marshals seized computers and documents critical of Scientology from Wollersheim's home after Scientology officials alleged that he was posting copyrighted material to the Internet. Pouw issued a 15-page statement to the press in response to the January 2008 publication of Andrew Morton's unauthorized biography of Tom Cruise, Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography. Pouw called the book a \\"bigoted defamatory assault replete with lies\\". Her statement about the book prompted Jenna Miscavige Hill, the niece of Scientology's leader David Miscavige, to publicly criticize Scientology and its practice of disconnection. Hill's written response was an open letter addressed to Pouw which was posted to the Internet, in which she stated: \\"I am absolutely shocked at how vehemently you insist upon not only denying the truths that have been stated about the church in that biography, but then take it a step further and tell outright lies.\\" Hill countered Pouw's denial of Scientology's practice of disconnection, saying: \\"As you well know, my parents officially left the church when I was 16 in 2000 ... Not only was I not allowed to speak to them, I was not allowed to answer a phone for well over a year, in case it was them calling me.\\" In response, Pouw told the Agence France-Presse: \\"The church stands by its statement of 14 January. The church does not respond to newsgroup postings.\\" Pouw has commented on the actions of the group Anonymous against the Church of Scientology as part of their movement Project Chanology. During Project Chanology's denial-of-service attacks on Church of Scientology websites in late January 2008, Pouw asserted to the Los Angeles Times that their websites \\"have been and are online\\". \\"These people are posing extremely serious death threats to our people. We are talking about religious hatred and bigotry,\\" said Pouw in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. She said that Scientology sees the Internet as a useful medium of communication and that it is \\"concentrating on using the Internet as a resource for promoting its message and mission in this world, not as a ground for litigation\\". In July 2010 the Church of Scientology International publicized a \\"Scientology Newsroom\\" website tailored for members of the media; Pouw was one of four international representatives for Scientology listed as \\"Spokespersons\\".

Democrats won the nationwide popular vote for the House of Representatives by a margin of 11.8 points and gained 27 seats, cementing their majority in that chamber. The House elections took place after the 1980 United States Census and the subsequent Congressional re- apportionment. In the gubernatorial elections, Democrats won a net gain of seven seats. The Democratic election gains were largely due to President Ronald Reagan's unpopularity as a result of the deepening 1982 recession which many voters blamed on his economic policies. The Democrats' gains put a check on Reagan's policies, as the incoming Congress (particularly the House) was significantly less open to Reagan's conservative policies. Despite the Democratic electoral gains, this election was the first time that the Republican Party had successfully defended a majority in either chamber of Congress since they did so in the 1928 elections.

They were the oldest and among the wealthiest men in the army and could afford high quality equipment. They wore heavy metal armor and carried large shields, their usual position being the third battle line. They were equipped with spears and were considered to be elite soldiers among the legion. During the Camillan era, they fought in a shallow phalanx formation, supported by light troops. In most battles triarii were not used because the lighter troops usually defeated the enemy before the triarii were committed to the battle. They were meant to be used as a decisive force in the battle, thus prompting an old Roman saying: res ad triarios venit, 'it comes down to the triarii', which meant carrying on to the bitter end.Gaspar, J. (1850-01-01). Autores selectos de la mas pura latinidad: Anotados brevemente √© ilustrados con algunas noticias de geograf√≠a costumbres, √© historia romana para uso de las escuelas pias (13th ed., Vol. 2, pp. 152). Barcelona: El Colegio de las Escuelas Pias de san Antonio Abad. Retrieved on 2014-05-02, from (note: link in Spanish) History and deployment According to author Pat Southern, triarii may have evolved from the old first class of the army under the Etruscan kings. The first class comprised the richest soldiers in the legion who were equipped with spears, breastplates and large shields, like heavy Greek hoplites. They served as heavy infantry in the early Roman army, and were used at the front of a very large phalanx formation. After a time, engagements with the Samnites and Gauls appear to have taught the Romans the importance of flexibility and the inadequacy of the phalanx on the rough, hilly ground of central Italy. Camillan era By the 4th century BC, the military formations the Romans had inherited from the Etruscans were still in use. Though their efficiency was doubtful, they proved effective against Rome's largely local adversaries. When Gauls invaded Etruria in 390 BC, the inhabitants requested help from Rome. The small contingent Rome sent to repel the Gallic invaders provoked a full-scale attack on Rome and the entire Roman army was destroyed at the Battle of the Allia. This crushing defeat prompted a series of military reforms by Marcus Furius Camillus. Under the new system, men were sorted into classes according to wealth, the triarii being the richest after the mounted equites. Triarii were armed with spears, or hastae, about 2 metres (6¬Ω feet) long. They also carried swords, or gladii, about 84 centimetres (29 inches) long, in case the spear broke or the enemy drew too close. They fought as hoplites, usually carrying clipei, large round Greek shields, and wearing bronze helmets, often with a number of feathers fixed onto the top to increase stature. Heavy plate armour was favoured, with mail also being popular. Many would paint or engrave portraits of ancestors onto their shield, believing that it would bring them luck in battle. In this new type of unit, the 900 triarii formed 15 maniples, military units of 60 men each, which were in turn part of 15 ordines, larger units made up of a maniple of triarii, a maniple of rorarii and a maniple of accensi. The triarii stood in the third line of the legion, behind the front line of hastati and the second line of principes, and in front of the rorarii and accensi. In a pitched battle, the leves, javelin-armed skirmishers who were attached to maniples of hastati, would form up at the front of the legion and harass the enemy with javelin fire and cover the advance of the hastati, spear armed infantry. If the hastati failed to break the enemy, they would fall back and let the principes, heavier and more experienced infantry, take over. If the principes did not break them, they would retire behind the triarii, who would then engage the enemy in turn‚Äîhence the expression rem ad Triarios redisse, \\"it has come to the triarii\\"‚Äîsignaling an act of desperation. The equites, cavalrymen, were used as flankers and to pursue routing enemies. The rorarii, the poorer reserve soldiers, and accensi, the least dependable troops armed with slings, would be used in a support role, providing mass and supporting wavering areas of the line. Polybian system thumb By the time of the Second Punic War of the late 3rd century BC, this system had proved inefficient against enemies such as Carthage. After a series of more \\"organic\\" changes as opposed to a single intentional reform, a new system gradually came into being. Infantry were sorted into classes according to age and experience rather than wealth, the triarii being the most experienced. Their equipment and role was very similar to the previous system, except they now carried scuta, large rectangular shields that offered a greater degree of protection than the old round clipeus. The number of triarii were reduced to 600 per legion, forming 10 maniples of 60 men each. The triarii still made up the third line in the legion, behind the front line of hastati and the second line of principes, but the rorarii and accensi were phased out. Leves had been replaced with velites, who had a similar role but were also attached to principes and triarii. Pitched battles were conducted in a similar fashion: the velites would gather at the front and fling javelins to cover the advance of the hastati. If the hastati failed to break the enemy, they would fall back on the principes, who along with the hastati, had been re-equipped with pila rather than spears. If the principes could not break the enemy they would retire behind the triarii, who would then engage the enemy. This order of battle was almost always followed, the Battle of the Great Plains and the Battle of Zama being among the few notable exceptions. At the Great Plains, Scipio, the Roman general, formed his men up in the usual manner, but once the hastati had begun to engage the enemy, he used his principes and triarii as a flanking force, routing the opposing Carthaginians. At Zama, Scipio arranged his men into columns, side-by-side, with large lanes in between. The opposing Carthaginian elephants were drawn into these lanes where many were killed by velites without inflicting many casualties on the Romans. Once the surviving elephants had been routed, Scipio formed his men into a long line with his triarii and principes in the centre and hastati on the flanks, ready to engage the Carthaginian infantry. Marian reforms With the formal military reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC, implemented to combat a shortage of manpower due to wars against Jugurtha in Africa and Germanic tribes to the north, the different classes of units were scrapped entirely. The wealth and age requirements were removed after which anyone could join as a career, rather than as service to the city, and all would be equipped as milites, with the same, state-purchased equipment. Auxiliaries, local irregular troops, would fulfill other roles, serving as archers, skirmishers and cavalry. Sallust, in his Jugurthine War, describes several instances in which Roman or allied regular heavy infantry were equipped with light equipment and used as light footsoldiers.Sallust, Jugurthine War, Bk CV.

The climate of the ecoregion is mostly of K√∂ppen's Mediterranean type with hot summers (Csa). Due to the wide altitudinal range of this ecoregion the highest elevations (above 1,000-1,400 m) are covered with coniferous forests, with a mixed broadleaf zone occurring lower. The coniferous forests are dominated by Pinus nigra subsp. nigra var. pallasiana, Abies cephalonica and A. borisii-regis, with deciduous European Beech in the north. Juniperus foetidissima occurs widely near the tree line. The dominant species on the lower elevations are remarkably diverse, including Aesculus hippocastanum (in more damp places) and various deciduous oaks (Quercus frainetto, Q. pubescens, Q. cerris, Q. trojana, Q. petraea). Evergreen oaks, mainly Q. calliprinos, and other Mediterranean sclerophyll shrubland species are abundant on dry and rocky south-facing slopes.

Originally conceived as a 'dark romantic' experience, Cauda Pavonis broke onto the UK goth circuit supporting acts such as Star Industry and Inkubus Sukkubus. At the outset Cauda Pavonis were noted for their consciously-minimalist synthesized melodies and their use of live drums (uncommon during the late 1990s in UK goth music). They were described by Mick Mercer in his book 21st Century Goth as a \\"Dark duo from UK with a bright future\\" and by Starvox as \\"The most old school sounding goth since Rozz Williams hung himself\\". Since then the line-up has grown and the band have appeared twice at the Whitby Gothic Weekend (2001, 2008) and the Wave-Gotik- Treffen. In 2003 and again in 2007, Cauda Pavonis were the focus of the ITV television programme, Magick Eve. History Formed in 1998 Cauda Pavonis concentrated on writing -- it was not until 1999 that they made their debut at the two-day festival Distopia 2, held at the Bristol Bierkeller. Between the 2000 Pistols at Dawn album and the 2001 Controversial Alchemy album, the band was fairly quiet as in September 2000 the band's tour schedule came to a halt when Farr broke her ankle. Across 2001 and 2003 they continued to tour, taking their album Controversial Alchemy across the UK. In 2003, the line-up was augmented by Chris Hines on guitars, and they gigged as a three-piece until the album Sigil was recorded. Shortly after the production of Sigil the band went back to the studio, and recorded two tracks for the TV show Magick Eve which the band then performed on the show. By 2005, the band had grown to a four-piece and released the EP Carnival Noir which was critically acclaimed by Mick Mercer in a full page article in his periodical The Mick, along with a full page spread in Germany's Gothic magazine. In 2005 Cauda Pavonis produced their first music video for Carnival Noir. This was filmed in the Full Moon with a group of friends and other members of the UK goth community. In 2006 the German rock band Chudoku added a cover of \\"Love Like Broken Glass\\" from the album Controversial Alchemy to their live show. Between 2001 and 2006 the band were responsible for running regular live gig nights in Bristol at The Full Moon pub in Stokes Croft. These nights opened the South West gig circuit up to several unsigned goth bands and DJs. The nights stopped in 2006 when the venue fell out of alternative hands and was turned into a backpackers lodge. The band spent much of 2011 and 2014 supporting Chameleons Vox, and Simon Hinkler (The Mission). The also became a regular support act on Toyah album retrospective tours. During 2011 they released a single for the Forgotten Heroes charity. In 2012, they were first amongst their peers to use the Pledgemusic website to crowdfund their album Peace Through Superior Firepower. 2012 also saw Adam Henderson (founding member and formerly of Inkubus Sukkubus) join the band as bass player and who stayed with them until April 2015 when he left to continue his own musical projects. In 2013, the band made it into print, aside from several previous magazine interviews between 1999 and 2013, by being featured in the co-authored work by Liz Williams and Trevor Jones, Diary of a Witchcraft Shop 2. In 2015, they produced their first download only EP, 'The Devil's Looking Glass'. This was unique in that it was not only delivered via a digital download card but that card itself was set in a Presentation Sleeve (a slightly oversized CD style square sleeve) to appeal to 'downloaders and collectors alike'. This appears to be the first production of such a presented format by a band.

It is found in agarolytic bacteria and is the first enzyme in the agar catabolic pathway. It is responsible for allowing them to use agar as their primary source of Carbon and enables their ability to thrive in the ocean. Agarases are classified as either Œ±-agarases or Œ≤-agarases based upon whether they degrade Œ± or Œ≤ linkages in agarose, breaking them into oligosaccharides. When secreted, Œ±-agarases yield oligosaccharides with 3.6 anhydro-L-galactose at the reducing end whereas Œ≤-agarases result in D-galactose residues. Function in Environment As could be expected, many species of agar-degraders are marine micro-organisms ‚Äì an adaptation to their environment which would be wasted in the majority of micro-organisms existing on land (although there are such examples, including a species of Paenibacillus in the Rhizosphere of Spinach). From species within genus Vibrio to Alteromonas, the presence of agarase allows agar-degrading bacteria an abundant food source in the ocean. Research also demonstrates that glucose can inhibit extracellular agarase secretion (but not transcription), causing it to degrade within the cell and thus limit growth of the bacteria. In addition, a study of the effects of phosphate limitation on agarase shows that limiting phosphate increases both intracellular agarase production and extracellular secretion, whereas a magnesium limitation does not. This further highlights the niche which this class of bacteria usually occupies, as the concentration of glucose or phosphate in the ocean is very low while magnesium concentration is generally much higher, suiting the agar-degrading bacteria‚Äôs agarase production; there is simply no need to use glucose in the ocean, so many organisms don't. While the optimal pH of agarase is 5.5, it is stable at a tolerant range, from 4.0 to 9.0.

He is considered to be the most famous convert of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, apart from Rupa Goswami and Sanatana Goswami. His story of integrity and unflinching faith in the face of extreme adversity is told in Chaitanya Charitamrita, Antya lila. It is believed that Chaitanya Mahaprabhu himself designated Haridasa as ', meaning the 'teacher of the Name'. Haridasa Thakura, was a devotee of God, Krishna, and had practiced chanting the names of the Lord, Hare Krishna, 300,000 times daily. Background Haridasa depicted in a temple exhibition image with 220px Haridasa Thakur was a prominent Vaishnava convert from Islam and is now venerated as a Hindu saint. From the very beginning of Chaitanya's 16th century bhakti movement in Bengal, Haridasa Thakur and other born Muslims as well as those of various faiths joined together to spread love of God. This openness received a boost from Bhaktivinoda Thakura's broad-minded vision in the late 19th century and was institutionalized by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati in his Gaudiya Matha in the 20th century. A disciple of Bhaktisiddhanta, Srila A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, is the founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, that celebrates festivals memory of Haridasa Thakura in India and worldwide. However one of the early records of the period by Isana Nagara, (c. 1564), author of the Advaita-prakasa, describes contemporary condition of the Hindus under 'Ala-ud-din Hussain Shah (1493‚Äì1519): Sources According to Murari Gupta's Krishna chaitanya charitamria, mlecchas (a word used for those who do not follow the four regulative principles) are the objects of Lords saving mercy, and as is the case of Haridasa shows, it produces even a great saint. While in contrast to this, another biographer, Kavi Karnapura, in his Krishna Chaitanya Chartamritam Maha-vakyam, written in Sanskrit in 1542, makes no explicit references to Islam, and when referring to the famed saint Haridasa, the author does not speak of his parentage. The earliest biography however, Chaitanya Bhagavata, would avoid use of the word 'mleccha', but would use 'yavana' some fifty times and it appears that the author himself knows more about Islam than an average Hindu will do. While some contend that Haridasa was born of Muslim parents and instead was simply brought up by them, Chaitanya Bhagavata suggests that apostasy from Islam was a capital offense in Bengal at the time and local qazi became aware of the conversion of Haridasa and brought him before the district governor, also a Muslim. Haridasa defends himself on the basis that there is only one God with many names. In this remarkable scene and speech Vaishnava convert Haridasa Thakur refuses to recite from a Muslim scripture, and was therefore sentenced, beaten and left for dead in the river. He however recovered instantly, convincing many he was a pir, a special mystical person. As a result, according to the author of Chaitanya Bhagavata, qazi was removed from the office. Some suggest that the episode illustrates, that it was the pressure of communal prestige rather than desire of the governor to instill the law, that resulted in the punishment of Haridasa, when he was caned on the marketplaces. In contrast with it, even if Hussain Shah was depicted as a destructive ruler in Orissa, author attests that many yavanas were devoted to Chaitanya, and would weep over Chaitanya and confess their faith in him. 190px The elements of the historiographies of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Chaitanya Charitamrta and Chaitanya Bhagavata contain main points illustrating the religious bigotry of the Muslims and the consequent persecution of the Hindus, Vaishnavas at the period. Both books retell a famous episode in the life of Chaitanya. He had introduced the public worship in the form of public kirtana and this enraged the local Muslim ruler. To prevent the recurrences of public kirtana the qazi patrolled the streets of Nadiya with a party. After organizing a large civil march, Chaitanya discussed with quazi the situation, who appears in more chastened mood. Author of Chaitanya Charitamrita attributes the change in the quazi's attitude to a miracle. In Chaitanya Chariamrita however it appears describes an overriding order by a superior of quazi to respect sankirtan Chaitanya, that was issued by the Husain Shah himself, who was impressed with the popularity of the saint. Ishana in chapter 7 of his Advaita-prakasa introduces Haridasa, being originally a Muslim, Haridasa is such an anomalous figure that his presence in the community seems to require explanation. Although Chaitanya himself insisted that anyone who is devoted to Krishna automatically becomes a brahmana, there were only very few non-brahmana, who played a role of leadership in the young group of Gaudiya Vaishnava movement. Ishana uses a reference from Bhagavata Purana (S.Bhag 10.13-14) to support high place of Haridasa in Gaudiya Vaishnavism, and to illustrate spiritual power of his guru, Advaita, to elevate him to such a position. He is a great saint Early life Born in the village of Buron (Budana), in the present district of Sat- khira, which was previously a sub-division of Khulna, now in Bangladesh. Haridasa was 35 years older than Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and his prayers along with prayers of Advaita Acharya were the reason for Chaitanya Mahaprabhu descent. Ishana Nagara in his book Advaita Prakasha, explains in great length that Haridasa Thakur was a follower of Advaita Acharya and also his close friend, he was raised in a Muslim family and then converted to Vaishnavism as a young man. Advaita Acharya repeatedly proclaims that becoming a Vaishnava, regardless of one's background, removes all past conditioning. When Haridasa Thakura was a young devotee of the Lord, he was allured by the incarnation of Maya-devi, but Haridasa easily passed the test because of his unalloyed devotion to Lord Krsna.Bhaktivedanta Swami, A. C. (1972). Bhagavad-gita As It Is , second edition. Los Angeles: Bhaktivedanta Book Trust p.136. He also believed to have stayed and chanted in a cave with a notorious snake, however, seemed unaffected by all of this. He did not even seem to be aware of the snake's presence. Haridasa first became associated with Advaita Acarya. Haricarana Dasa, the biographer of Advaita Acharya says that all the demigods in heaven heard prayers of Advaita and reveal themselves to him, therefore when Advaita saw Haridasa, he could immediately recognize that he was Brahma incarnate and named him Hari-dasa (literary meaning servant of God). He instructs Haridasa to recite Krishna's names and assures him that Krishna will always show mercy to Haridasa. The close relationship between the two and the fact that Advaita was feeding a Muslim, became a subject of malicious gossip. This apparent anomaly created a stir in the local brahmana community. Others couldn't understand why a powerful ascetic was disregarding a convention of staying away from Muslims. The fact that community was disturbed is reflected in both Chaitanya Charitamrita and in Chaitanya Bhagavata. Haricarana Dasa, according to historical records, confirms that while Advaita was from the higher ranks of Bengali brahmana community, he completely ignored the facts about Haridasa's background, impressed with the young man's heartfelt devotion. While others became upset with Advaita's attention to Haridasa, and threatened to excommunicate Advaita, Advaita tells Haridasa to pay no attention to 'those petty people'. Legend says that one morning, Advaita schedules a fire ceremony, agnihotra. When preparations for this ritual is about to begin, there is no fire to be found in the whole town. The ceremony is thus stranded and couldn't proceed. Advaita points out to all local brahmana priests that if priests are true to their religious teachings, there must be fire, and tells them to approach Haridasa with dried grass in their hands. When Haridasa kindles the grasses by his potency, he also, according to this record, manifests his four-faced Brahma-like form. While Agni, the deity of Vedas responsible for fire, should have been under the control of the brahmanas, it's only the Muslim born Haridasa who ignites the fires, by the power of his devotion, 'the purity those born brahmana have lost'. Teachings Set of Japa mala beads, made from sacred Tulasi wood, with head bead in foreground. Beads were used for chanting of Hare Krishna mantra by Haridas Thakura According to the philosophy of the holy name given by Haridasa Thakura, if you are on the platform of namabhasa (early or reflective stage of the pure chanting), it gives the chanter liberation, moksa. Whereas pure chanting gives prema, or 'Love of God'. An episode from Chaitanya Charitamrita illustrates different side of the life of Haridasa Thakura, and does not allude to the trial of the Haridasa by the Muslim ruler, but gives details of a sakta brahmana, who would hire a harlot to try (unsuccessfully) to seduce the celibate saint. In this story the avenging instruments of divine justice are none other than the agents of the Muslim king, who eventually punishes Ramachandra Khan.(CC Antya. 3.98-163) Hare Krishna Mahamantra chanted by Haridasa and spread throughout the world by Prabhupada Haridasa Thakur was chanting mantra consisting of the names Hare, Krishna and Rama. Hare Krishna mantra appears originally in the : > Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama > Rama Hare Hare It is often referred to as the \\"Maha Mantra\\" (great mantra) by practitioners. Following the footsteps of Haridasa Thakur in 1966, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada established ISKCON (the International Society for Krishna Consciousness), a branch of the Brahma-Madhva-Gaudiya Vaishnava sampradaya, and introduced the Hare Krishna mantra to the West, described as: \\"an easy yet sublime way of liberation in the Age of Kali.\\" Preaching of Hare Krishna chanting He was asked to join forces with Nityananda who was older than Chaitanya by some eight years, and he believed to infuse into the movement a great passion. Haridasa and Nityananda are famed for conversion of two notorious scoundrels, Jagai and Madhai, of Navadvipa into the new faith. They are considered important lieutenants in the campaign for spreading the sankirtana movement, chanting of the holy names: Brahma, in the form of Haridasa Thakura, and later, Balarama as Nityananda. Other associates of Chaitanya called Haridas Different associates of Chaitanya with this name include: :1. Haridasa Pandita (also known as Sri Raghu Gopala and as Sri Rasa- manjari), a disciple of Sri Ananta Acaryam. He is according to Tarapada Mukherjee is of a later generation.Mukherjee, Tarapada. 'ChaitanyacaritAmritamahAkAvya', Caturanga, May 1985 (Calcutta), 57-70.Mukherjee, Tarapada. 'Chaitanyacaritamriter racanakal evam vrajer gaudiyasampradaya', Sahitya Parishad Patrika, 87.1, 1987 (Calcutta), 1-39. The fact that he is mentioned in the verses derived from Chaitanya Charitamrita, Adi 8 as a listener rather than participants in lila distinguishes them from contemporaries like that of Rupa and the others mentioned who were direct associates of Chaitanya. However according to Krishnadasa Kaviraja, the book which was read in the meetings of the first generation of Chaitanya followers in Vrindavan was the Bhagavata Purana itself and not Chaitanya's life story. :2. Haridas (Junior), who accompanied Chaitanya on the journey to South India. It is believed that Chaitanya forsook the company of Junior Haridas because of an incident, that was against strict principles of a detached saint.p. 27 Identity Pilgrims at Haridasa Thakur memorial tomb, 230px Haridasa Thakur in Gaudiya Vaishnavism is believed to be a combined incarnation of Brahma Mahatapa, the son of Richika Muni and Prahlada. The respected Murari Gupta has written in his Chaitanya Charitamrita that this sage's son picked a tulasi leaf and offered it to Krishna without having washed it first. His father then cursed him to become a mleccha in his next life. He was thus born as Haridasa, a great devotee. (Gaura-ganoddesha-dipika 93-95) Nabadwip-dhama-mahatmya by Bhaktivinoda Thakur has written the following account of how Brahma became Haridasa Thakur: From the above it is understood that he was an incarnation of the secondary creator Brahma. It is said that in order to overcome his pride, he asked for a birth in a lowly family. Similar description is found in Advaita-vilasa. Last years Last years Haridasa has spent in Jagannatha Puri as a close associate of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. One time Caitanya Mahaprabhu took Haridasa Thakura within the flower garden, and in a very secluded place He showed him his residence. He asked Haridasa to remain there and chant the Hare Krishna mantra, and said that He would personally come there to meet him every day. ‚ÄúRemain here peacefully and look at the cakra on top of the temple and offer obeisances. As for as your prasadam is concerned, I shall arrange to have it sent here‚Äù.Chaitanya Charitamrita (Madhya-lila 11.195) Although Haridasa was not allowed to visit the temple because of the custom, Chaitanya promised to come and see him daily. To the belief of Gaudiya Vaishnavas this indicates that Haridasa Thakura was so advanced in spiritual life that although he was considered unfit to enter the temple of Jagannatha, he's being personally visited by the lord every day. Prabhupada however on a number of occasions states that one should not imitate the behavior of Haridasa Thakura. He says the spiritual master gives different orders to different disciples: Death (Disappearance) He reasons ill who tells that Vaishnavas die When thou art living still in Sound! The Vaishnavas die to live & living try To spread the holy name around! Verse by Bhaktivinoda Thakura on the tomb of Haridasa Thakura at Puri, India, published in Swami Prabhupada's Narada Bhakti Sutra, (3.50, purport). It is believed that Haridasa was buried on the ocean shore by Caitanya himself. Dr. A. N. Chatterjee makes a point in his doctoral thesis entitled \\"Chaitanya's impact on medieval Indian society\\" that death of Haridasa Thakura is one of the most important incidents which deserve mention when dealing with the last few years of Caitanya Mahaprabhus life. Haridasa dies after most of other Gaudiya Vaishnavas depart home from Puri, he collapses one day while singing Krishnas name. He is then placing a foot of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu on his chest and dies crying out \\"Sri Krishna Chaitanya\\". Mahaprabhu himself places Haridasa to 280pxEven when mahatmas, great souls, do appear in human society, they are often not appreciated or understood. Illustrating Gaudiya Vaishnava perspective on it Prabhupada writes: However, if one gets the association of a such mahatma and is receptive to his blessings, it is believed that one will infallibly be benefited.Narada-Bhakti-Sutra: The Secrets of Transcendental Love, A.

The film, due for release in September 2020, looks at the challenges of making wine in a region that has always witnessed upheaval and yet one which around 3,500 years ago, via the Phoenician traders, gave the gift of wine to the world. The documentary charts this historical journey, focusing mainly on testimonies from winemakers and other Lebanese from latter part of the 20th Century, in particular those who endured the 1975-91 civil war and the 2006 summer war and who continue to be affected by the ongoing conflict in neighbouring Syria and the political instability that defines Lebanon and the wider Middle East.

It was invented in Germany in 1891, and by 1922 was being marketed in the United Kingdom by the Berkefeld Filter Co.\\"Berkefeld Filter Co (British)\\" , Grace's Guide, accessed 2010-09-22 Berkefeld was the name of the owner of the mine in Hanover, Germany, where the ceramic material was obtained. The Berkefeld is a good bacterial water filter used in microbiological laboratories, in homes and out in the field.Textbook of Microbiology by Prof. C P Baveja, Textbook of Microbiology by Ananthanarayan and Panikar,  Design and mode of action  The filter housing consists of two metal or plastic cylinders sitting one on top of the other. The upper one has a lid and can be filled with impure water. In the bottom of the upper cylinder are one or more holes fitted with porcelain filter columns. The water is forced through the filters by gravity,SafeTrek Survival Foods - Dried and Dehydrated One-Year and Four-Year Packages and then trickles down to the lower cylinder where it is stored and tapped off as required. Some types of filter are fitted with a carbon core to act as a deodorizing adsorbent.FAQ from British Berkefeld on New Millennium Concepts They may also be impregnated with silver to inhibit bacterial growth. Some types, depending on their grade of porosity, also remove certain microscopic fungi and particulate matter. The filters without silver impregnation are sterilized by autoclaving or by steam sterilizer after a thorough cleaning.  Berkey Filters  New Millenium Concepts (NMC) Ltd. received a license to distribute British Berkefeld filters in North America. However, they developed their own purification element in 2003, called the \\"Black Berkey,\\" which is used in \\"Berkey\\" water filters. NMC's Black Berkey purification elements employ a mix of six different filtration media, whereas the British Berkefeld water filter's purification elements were composed primarily of diatomaceous earth.  Types  The filters are classified according to the diameter of the pores in the ceramic material: * V (Viel) - Coarsest pores * N (Normal) - Intermediate sized pores * W (Wenig) - Finest pores  Usefulness  The Berkefeld is a cheap, portable and efficient bacterial filter in general, though it does not remove viruses like Hepatitis A and some bacteria such as mycoplasma. Some companies claim that they filter out from between 100% of particles above 0.9 micrometre to 98% of particles above 0.5 micrometre in diameter. These are very durable filters and the filter elements may be cleaned over 100 times before requiring replacement. Some of the first Berkefeld filters were used during the 1892 cholera epidemic in Hamburg.

In his M√©moires, Fouch√© affirmed that, towards mid-September 1800, a plot arose aiming at assassinating Napoleon at the operahouse.

Early life McMinn was born in Newry, County Down, Ireland, a son of Joseph McMinn (c. 1794 ‚Äì 6 April 1874) and his wife Martha McMinn, n√©e Hamill (c. 1805 ‚Äì 13 December 1861), who with their large family emigrated to Adelaide on the Albatross, arriving in September 1850. Newspaper reports only mention Mrs McMinn and 8 children aboard Albatross. No details of his (or his brothers') schooling are known, though it has been asserted that he was taught by one Mr McGeorge of Adelaide, however no teacher of that or similar name has yet come to light. It is likely the youngest children were home-educated, with the boys receiving tuition in drafting and surveying from a tutor. Career After completing school, he was articled to the architect James Macgeorge, and was appointed to the Architect-in-Chief's office, but in April 1864 left for employment as a chainman in Boyle Travers Finniss's 1864‚Äì65 expedition to Northern Australia surveying the area around Escape Cliffs and the Adelaide River. Following a breakdown of morale in the settlement, McMinn and six others (Stow, Hamilton, Hake, Edwards, White, and Davis, the last two being boatmen) purchased a 23-foot open boat which they dubbed the Forlorn Hope and sailed it to Champion Bay, near Geraldton, Western Australia. In late 1870 or early 1871 he was appointed as overseer of construction of the Overland Telegraph section from Port Augusta to Darwin, and on 3 May 1871 cancelled the contract tendered by Darwent & Dalwood, they having fallen behind schedule due to heavy rain. Critics of his action pointed out that with the onset of the dry season and better logistics this loss could easily have been made up. The work was put in the hands of engineer R. V. Patterson with instructions to finish the line by early 1872 no matter what the cost. McMinn was dismissed shortly after his return to Adelaide in July 1871, and William T. Dalwood was later awarded compensation of ¬£11,000. McMinn began practising as an architect in 1867, briefly in partnership with Daniel Garlick, and later with some others, but usually independently. He designed many grand private residences, but also designed or assisted in the design of many of Adelaide's grand public buildings. Whilst in partnership with Edward John Woods, he designed the original Venetian Gothic building (later designated the Mitchell Building) of the University of Adelaide, considered his greatest work.

Unlike fellow Terrytoons characters Mighty Mouse, silly Gandy Goose and the magpie duo Heckle and Jeckle, Dinky never became popular, appearing in a total of only 15 cartoons between 1939 and 1957. For most of his appearances, Dinky was a young black duck who lived on a farm with other ducks, chickens and other typical farm animals. Sometimes he was an orphan who simply wanted a place to call home; on other occasions, he would perform some heroic deed and help restore calm to the barnyard when adult animals quarreled. The early Dinky Duck cartoons had Dinky making a sharp quacking noise, while the later ones gave a young voice to Dinky. Several of the cartoons had a singing chorus that gave an introduction to the upcoming story. Dinky's final appearance was in It's a Living, a CinemaScope cartoon, in which he sheds his cute farmyard duck persona and instead takes on the role of a disgruntled animation actor who quits his cartoon character job to try his hand in television commercial acting. Dinky was going to have a cameo in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but rights to the character could not be obtained in time. Dinky was a supporting character in the 1999 pilot Curbside.

Weather conditions  On 24 December 1958 much of the south of England was covered in thick fog making travel by any means hazardous. Many aircraft had to be diverted as visibility was below the minimum permissible distance at most of the airports on the south coast. To a pilot who was less than aware of the conditions on the ground and the altitude at which they were flying, this fog would have an appearance very similar to normal cloud cover. For the pilots of G-AOVD this may have added to the illusion that they were at a much higher altitude and that they were reading the instruments correctly.  Accident sequence  The aircraft departed from London Heathrow Airport at 10:10 am on a test flight to renew its certificate of airworthiness with 12 persons aboard including five crew. After completing the test, at approximately 11:55 am, the crew requested clearance to descend from 12,000 feet to 3,000 feet for approach to Hurn Airport, possibly as an alternate destination due to poor weather at Heathrow. Approximately 3 minutes later, at 11:58 am, Hurn Airport lost contact with the aircraft as it struck the ground, crossing a road into a ploughed field, bringing down telephone lines and trees and alerting residents in the nearby villages. Upon realising they had lost contact with the aircraft, the controller at Hurn contacted the emergency services giving the last known position before contact was lost. Likewise the residents of Winkton, Sopley, and people living near Bransgore contacted emergency services saying they believed that they had heard the sound of a low flying aircraft and the sound of a crash.  Emergency response and rescue of survivors  Around midday, the members of the volunteer fire service in Burley and Christchurch were alerted by an air raid siren calling them to the station to respond to the report of the crash. The initial report from Hurn Airport stated that they were unaware of the type of aircraft involved or how many passengers were being carried, and that they believed the aircraft was to the north of the airport when it crashed. However, on receiving updated information on the reports from Winkton and Sopley the fire crews decided to start the search for the aircraft in that area. The fire service searching in Winkton discovered the location of the wreckage after travelling a short distance along the Burley Road and finding telephone poles and cables which had been broken and dragged into a field off the road. A foot search was mounted and eventually the crew spotted some broken trees along with aircraft debris and a fire. The crew chief sent a message to fire control to confirm the location of the crash and set up a rendezvous at a local public house to give emergency services a positive location. Another appliance which had been sent to Sopley to search there could not be contacted as it was not fitted with a radio; fortunately, however, its crew encountered other appliances heading towards the incident, and were then informed of the location. Another hindrance to the emergency effort was the lack of a four-wheel drive appliance which meant that the firemen had to attempt to drive an eight-ton vehicle over a ploughed field, which delayed the rescue. While this was going on, the crew chief and some of the crew from the first appliance on the scene continued to search on foot and eventually found the remains of the cockpit with the injured co-pilot trapped inside. They began to cut him free and as further emergency services arrived on the scene, a coordinated search and rescue effort was mounted over the site, fanning out and finding a further two survivors. The fire station was eventually able to confirm what aircraft had been involved and the number of people on board at the time. Having received this information the emergency services were able to account for all the people involved and to continue putting out the fires.  Investigation  The crash was attributed to a failure on the part of the captain and first officer to correctly establish the altitude of the aircraft before and during the descent. The Britannia aircraft was fitted with a three-handed altimeter which required a higher degree of concentration to read correctly than was desirable. The crew misread the instrument believing that they were at 11,500 feet when they began descending, when in fact they were at only 1,500 feet. As a result, they flew the aircraft into the ground which was obscured by fog at the time. The type of flight in which the aircraft was engaged was also thought to be a contributing factor. It was concluded that this crash was a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) and that there were no defects with the aircraft or its systems which contributed to the crash. For this the failure to read the instruments correctly rests with the captain. This was not the first crash involving a crew misreading this type of altimeter in this long distance, high altitude aircraft. As a direct result of this and other similar incidents, altimeters would now be required to display a cross-hatch or chequered flag when indicating an altitude below 1500 feet. Furthermore, all fire appliances in Christchurch would now be fitted with radios for improved communication, and when four-wheel drive appliances became available, Christchurch was one of the first rural stations to be allocated one. Aftermath As a result of the accident the Ministry of Transport issued a directive to replace all three- pointer altimeters in British registered aircraft which operated at over 20,000 feet before September 1959. This followed an investigation of the problems of interpretation of the display. An interim flight safety warning was also issued pending altimeter replacement which described the risk of misreading these altimeters as \\"most likely when the routine monitoring of the instrument panel has been interrupted. If this happened during climb or descent the height when the instruments are rescanned may be very different from the anticipated.\\" See also * Some other crashes where three-handed altimeter misreadings are suspected: ** Iberia Airlines Flight 062 ** United Airlines Flight 389  References   External links  * * Photo of G-AOVD taken in New York from the Ed Coates collection * G-AOVD on the register of the Civil Aviation Authority Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving controlled flight into terrain Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by weather Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving fog Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1958 Category:1958 in England Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in England Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Bristol Britannia Bristol Britannia 1958 Category:History of Dorset Category:20th century in Dorset Category:December 1958 events Category:Airliner accidents and incidents in the United Kingdom ","title":"1958 BOAC Bristol Britannia crash"},{"id":"17733226","text":"Big Survey Wildlife Management Area is a Wildlife Management Area in Wythe County, Virginia.

It stars Alan Rickman, Chris Pine, and Bill Pullman and is directed by Randall Miller, who wrote the screenplay along with Jody Savin and Ross Schwartz. It premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. Plot Sommelier and wine shop owner Steven Spurrier (Alan Rickman), a British expatriate living in Paris, is concerned with how to save his business in his daily conversation with Maurice (Dennis Farina), a wine lover from Milwaukee who is Spurrier's regular (sometimes only) customer. He concocts a plan to hold a blind taste-test intended to introduce Parisians to the quality wines coming from elsewhere in the world. Spurrier travels to the not-yet- famous Napa Valley in search of contestants for his Judgment of Paris taste test, where a chance meeting introduces him to founding vintner Jim Barrett (Bill Pullman) of Chateau Montelena. Barrett wants no part in it, believing it to be a set-up designed by the French to humiliate New World wine producers. Barrett's son, Bo (Chris Pine), secretly passes Spurrier a couple of bottles of the Chateau's chardonnay for the competition. Comely and nonconformist university graduate student Sam Fulton (Rachael Taylor) arrives at Chateau Montelena seeking an internship, and is promptly put to work while stirring up interest among Bo and vineyard foreman Gustavo (Freddy Rodriguez). Due to reductionist techniques in wine making (the absence/reduction of oxygen during the wine making process), the chardonnay has turned brown in the bottles, causing Barrett Sr. to call for the whole vintage to be carted away for dumping. But Bo discovers the brown color is only temporary and manages to recover the vintage, thanks to the help of local bar owner Joe (Eliza Dushku) who had intercepted the bottles on the way to the dump. On the way back to Chateau Montelena, Bo's car runs out of gas, forcing him and Sam to find someone to help them out. After several unsuccessful attempts on Bo's part, Sam takes over and gets a driver (who turns out to be a police officer) to pull over by exposing her breasts. Even though she could get arrested for indecent exposure, the officer agrees to help them out. Bo is asked to travel to Paris to represent the Napa Valley vintners at the contest. After tallying the scores from the eight Parisian judges, Spurrier is shocked to find that Montelena's Chardonnay has won the competition. The report is featured in an article of Time; restaurants and wine shops all around America are asked continuously for the wine (Chateau Montelena Chardonnay 1973) and forced to admit that they do not have it. This twist of fate and the resultant oenological epiphany forever changes the fortunes of Napa Valley wineries and the global wine industry as a whole, as it is revealed that French wines are in fact not unbeatable. In the end, the futures of the characters are revealed: Jim Barrett continues to make wine into his 80s, although Bo now runs the winery. A bottle of Montelena Chardonnay 1973 and the red wine, Stags Leap cabernet sauvignon 1973, also from California, that had won the same competition were given a display case at the Smithsonian Institution. In 2006, thirty years after the first competition, Steven Spurrier hosted another contest, this time with full confidence that French wine would win. California won again. Cast * Alan Rickman as Steven Spurrier * Bill Pullman as Jim Barrett * Chris Pine as Bo Barrett * Rachael Taylor as Sam Fulton * Freddy Rodriguez as Gustavo Brambila * Eliza Dushku as Joe * Dennis Farina as Maurice Accuracy Steven Spurrier himself has questioned the accuracy of the script while he was involved in another movie project depicting the events of the Judgment of Paris, stating: \\"\\"There is hardly a word that is true in the script and many, many pure inventions as far as I am concerned\\". While the film depicts Gustavo Brambila as being at Chateau Montelena throughout the events leading up to the Judgment of Paris, his 22-year term at Montelena actually began just after the tasting. While at Chateau Montelena, Brambila worked closely with Mike Grgich ‚Äì who, although not depicted in the film, was the winemaker behind the 1973 Montelena Chardonnay that won in Paris. In the film, the prize-winning chardonnay turns brown for 24 hours after bottling. In real life, the wine turned off-color for a short time after it was bottled, not an uncommon occurrence, and Grgich knew how to handle it.  Critical response  The film received mixed reviews. , the film holds a 48% approval rating on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 124 reviews with an average rating of 5.62 out of 10.
