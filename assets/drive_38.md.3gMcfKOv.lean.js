It is located in an area known as the \\"Heart of Atlanta\\" straddling the railroad gulch (\\"The Gulch\\"), \\"due to [its] proximity to the 'Zero Mile Post' which marked both the Southeastern terminus of the Western and Atlantic railroad and the city's earliest settlement\\". The former Atlanta Constitution Building was designed by Adolph Wittman and was located at the opposite corner of the intersection beginning in 1895.http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/meta/html/dlg/vang/meta_dlg_vang_ful0395.html  History  The five-story Atlanta Constitution Building was constructed in 1947 and designed by Robert and Company at a cost of $3 million. The building housed the headquarters of the Atlanta Constitution newspaper during tenure of editor Ralph McGill until its consolidation with the Atlanta Journal when James C. Cox of the Journal bought the Constitution. > Expenses for the modern plant included “new presses, steel desks, marble > corridors and every mechanical contrivance for publishing a modern newspaper > in the shortest possible time.” Additionally, WCON, the Constitution's new > radio station, was located on the top floor of the building. Retail space > occupied the building's sloping base level. Upon moving in, Editor Ralph > McGill expressed his desire that the Constitution's prestige should grow to > match its new home. The newspaper subsequently outgrew its building and moved in 1953. There was construction or remodeling undertaken the same year. Georgia Power moved into the building in 1955 until 1960, and many Atlantans paid their electricity bills at this downtown location. Georgia Power moved to its new location on 241 Ralph McGill Boulevard when the building was finished in 1981. The downtown building has been vacant since 1972. The building was placed on the 2003 List of Endangered Buildings by the Buildings Worth Saving Committee of the Atlanta Preservation Center.  Architectural significance  The building is typical of the art moderne movement. Its exterior is composed of Flemish bond brick, marble and limestone. It has a flat terraced roof deck, typical of many structures of the modern movement, curved corners, a \\"prow-like\\" end and windows on all floors exude horizontal significance. Because of its modernism's rarity in Atlanta, it is considered eligible for the National Register of Historic Places due to its architecture under Criterion C and Criterion A because of local significance stemming from Georgia Power's use of the site. Julian Harris of Georgia Tech sculpted a bas-relief piece depicting the \\"History of the Press\\". After the building's abandonment in 1972, the sculpture was moved to the Georgia World Congress station of MARTA. It is located near the escalators of the Centennial Olympic Park Drive entrance. Another piece, an aluminum and terrazzo medallion depicting the state seal of Georgia which was embedded in the floor of the building's entrance, is currently on display in the entrance of McElreath Hall at the Atlanta History Center.  Current plans  The Atlanta Constitution Building in 2016 The Georgia Department of Transportation is the current owner of the site and has plans to demolish the building and erect a two-story, minimalist steel and glass structure to house the planned Atlanta Multi-Modal Passenger Terminal, also known as the main depot for proposed commuter rail and, possibly someday, high-speed rail, for the region. On July 14, 2010, the Georgia Department of Transportation announced its plans to hire a developer to transform the area. Requests for proposals are due in September and the winning developer will be announced May 2011. The Atlanta Preservation Center published an article on the Atlanta Constitution Building in its newsletter, Preservation Times: > The APC has been advocating for the city to consider this building as part > of its multimodal rail system.

Born in Wormley in 1772, Long would specialise in watercolours of landscapes depicting the Bromley area in Kent. Long, who was an honorary exhibitor at the Royal Academy from 1807 to 1822 and at the British Institution in 1825, studied with Thomas Girtin and Henry Edridge. Examples of her work are held by Galleries of Scotland National Galleries of Scotland, Dundee Art Gallery, and the British Museum, and Bromley Historic Collections. Long was the elder daughter of Sir Abraham Hume and Amelia Egerton. Together with her sister Sophia, Countess Brownlow, she was heiress to her parents' art collection. Well known in her day as a judge of art and a skilled horticulturist, Long largely assisted or was solely the designer, in laying out the gardens at Bromley Hill Place, Kent, a 1760s property she and her husband Charles Long bought in 1801 and enlarged according to their own designs. By 1809, the gardens at Bromley Hill House had two mile-long, picturesque walks, and the present view of St. Paul's Cathedral. Long's paintings of four separate views from the grounds of Bromley Hill House were exhibited between 1811 and 1817. The gardens have since disappeared, but the house, though altered, remains. Lady Long was given an early introduced plant of Wisteria from China, Glycine Sinensis by Thomas Carey Palmer. She grew this wisteria \\"beautifully trained over an umbrella shaped ironwork frame\\". She died at Bromley Hill on 15 January 1837, and was buried at Wormley, Hertfordshire, with an elaborate tomb by Richard Westmacott.

He is best known as the minister that authored and countersigned with Princess Isabel, then Princess Imperial Regent the law that ended slavery in Brazil. Rodrigo was born in São Paulo into a family of wealthy financiers. His father, the Baron of Tietê, was also a politician and leader of the conservative party in São Paulo. Rodrigo became a deputy in the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil when he was 24 years old and served a total of seven terms representing the province of São Paulo. He later served as President of the Legislative Assembly of São Paulo, cabinet minister in two conservative governments and senator of the empire. Even though he died relatively young his career lasted over 30 years. In his first year as a deputy and throughout his career he defended policies to increase immigration from Europe, industrialization of the empire, improvement of infrastructure, modernization of the financial system and access to credit for the agricultural sector.  Early life  Rodrigo Augusto da Silva was born on 7 December 1833, in the imperial city of São Paulo, capital of the province of São Paulo. He was the son of José Manuel da Silva and Maria Reducinda da Cunha e Silva. He had one older brother named Candido Justiniano and two sisters, named Raphaela and Joaquina Angelica. Rodrigo was the paternal grandson of José da Silva de Carvalho, a municipal judge and commanding officer of the Portuguese ordinances in Santo Amaro. Rodrigo's grandfather was a wealthy land owner and capitalist that acted as a private mortgage lender. Rodrigo's father followed his father's steps and got involved in commerce and finance in the city of São Paulo. In his banking career José Manuel became president of the São Paulo branch of the Bank of Brazil and the Caixa Econômica. As a leader of the moderate party, later conservative party, José Manuel was part of the government of São Paulo in the years after the Independence of Brazil, serving in different positions in the municipal and provincial governments. Rodrigo attended the Largo de São Francisco Law School where he graduated with a bachelor of laws degree in 1856. In law school he was a member of a secret society called Brasilica. This society was founded by law students and had as its main objective the strengthening of conservative ideas. The society counted among the initiated political figures connected to Rodrigo and the conservative party, among them Antonio da Silva Prado, Thomas Coelho and Delfino Cintra. According to a biographer, in his academic years Rodrigo \\"revealed a lucid and easy intelligence, firmness of character, unbreakable dedication, clear vision and noble political ideas.\\" Rodrigo spoke and wrote notoriously well, had a passion for classical literature and knew how to dress with great elegance. These characteristics would later afford him the nickname \\"the diplomat\\". While still a student in 1856 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of São Paulo, he finished his senior year and occupied a seat in the Legislative Assembly at the same time. In 1857 he moved to Rio de Janeiro to occupy a seat in the Chamber of Deputies, Rodrigo was a permanent substitute and represented the 1st district of São Paulo. In Rio de Janeiro he married Catharina de Queirós Mattoso Ribeiro, daughter of conservative leader Eusébio de Queirós. Catharina would die during the birth of Maria Custodia, the couple's only child.  Political career  Conservative politician = In 1885 conflict among different interest groups created a crisis in the Liberal government. = Slavery abolition = Later years  Death = After months of suffering Rodrigo died surrounded by his friends, among them writer Machado de Assis. His death caused wide commotion in the empire. Rodrigo's funeral was watched by members of the government, the abolitionist movement and leaders of the black community. Official mourning was declared and the Ministry of Agriculture, Commerce and Public works; the Senate; the Chamber of Deputies; and the Postal Service were closed. The New York Times published the following regarding his death on the 24 November 1889: > We have to record the death of another prominent man in Brazilian politics, > that of Counselor Rodrigo Augusto da Silva, which took place at his > residence in this city (Rio de Janeiro), at 8:30 P.M. on the 17th inst.

Notes  *The timing of the crisis was delicate since republicanism was no longer only an idea but a threat. To aggravate the situation Dom Pedro II was becoming indifferent to the threats of a republic, as he declared to Counselor Saraiva: \\"It will be my retirement. I will become a teacher!\\" The emperor's heiress, Princess Isabel had little support in the ruling classes and was connected to an ultraconservative Catholic movement. When Dom Pedro II asked Counselor Saraiva what he taught of his daughter's future reign, he ironically replied: \\"The kingdom of your daughter is not of this world\\". Rodrigo, answering for the conservatives on 8 June 1885 declared in the Chamber of Deputies: \\"If, after more than half a century of battles, of efforts, of immense sacrifices, we arrived at this deplorable state of the system that rules over us, with reason those three representatives of the new idea (pointing to the three republican deputies) can ask us with contempt in their lips: what have you obtained with this form of government, that you judge to be in this country the only guarantee of political order and also the only guarantee of stability for all rights and social interests? I finish by saying that it is the case to say, as an eminent parliamentary of the time of Charles X: 'Nothing remains for us to do here. Let's go to our windows watch the funerals of the monarchy passing by'!\\" *In the words of Egas: \\"Rodrigo Silva was called the diplomat for his distinct manners and for his notorious elegance in dressing and presenting himself.

The linewidth of a laser is a measure of its phase noise. The spectrogram of a laser is produced by passing its light through a prism. The spectrogram of the output of a pure noise-free laser will consist of a single infinitely thin line. If the laser exhibits phase noise, the line will have non-zero width. The greater the phase noise, the wider the line. The same will be true with oscillators. The spectrum of the output of a noise-free oscillator has energy at each of the harmonics of the output signal, but the bandwidth of each harmonic will be zero. If the oscillator exhibits phase noise, the harmonics will not have zero bandwidth. The more phase noise the oscillator exhibits, the wider the bandwidth of each harmonic. Phase noise is a noise in the phase of the signal. Consider the following noise free signal: :v(t) = Acos(2πf0t). Phase noise is added to this signal by adding a stochastic process represented by φ to the signal as follows: :v(t) = Acos(2πf0t + φ(t)). If the phase noise in an oscillator stems from white noise sources, then the power spectral density (PSD) of the phase noise produced by an oscillator will be Sφ(f) = n/f 2, where n specifies the amount of noise. The PSD of the output signal would then be :S_v(f) = \\\\frac{A^2}{2}\\\\frac{cf_0^2}{c^2 \\\\pi^2 f_0^4 + (f - f_0)^2}, where n = 2cf02. Define the corner frequency fΔ = cπ f02 as the linewidth of the oscillator. Then :S_v(f_0 + \\\\Delta f) = \\\\frac{A^2}{2\\\\pi}\\\\frac{f_\\\\Delta}{f_\\\\Delta^2 + \\\\Delta f^2}. It is more common to report oscillator phase noise as L, the ratio of the single-sideband (SSB) phase noise power to the power in the fundamental (in dBc/Hz). In this case :L(\\\\Delta f) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi}\\\\frac{f_\\\\Delta}{f_\\\\Delta^2 + \\\\Delta f^2}. Adding phase noise neither increases nor decreases the power of the signal. It simply redistributes the power by increasing the bandwidth over which the signal is present while decreasing the amplitude of the signal that occurs at the nominal oscillation frequency. The total noise power, as found by integrating the power spectral density over all frequencies, remains constant regardless of the amount of phase noise. This is illustrated in the figures on the right. It can be proven by integrating L over all frequencies to compute the total power of the signal. :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}L(\\\\Delta f)d\\\\Delta f = \\\\frac{f_\\\\Delta}{\\\\pi}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{d\\\\Delta f}{f_\\\\Delta^2 + \\\\Delta f^2} = \\\\left.\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi}\\\\tan^{-1}(\\\\frac{\\\\Delta f}{f_\\\\Delta})\\\\right_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}= 1 See also *Laser linewidth *Spectral linewidth *Introduction to RF Simulation and its Application by Ken Kundert Category:Oscillators Category:Stochastic processes Category:Statistical signal processing ","title":"Oscillator linewidth"},{"id":"21769752","text":"Carlos Ferreira may refer to: * Carlos Amaral Ferreira, Portuguese Paralympic athlete * Carlos Ferreira (sailor) (born 1931), Portuguese former sailor * Carlos Vaz Ferreira (1872–1958), Uruguayan philosopher, writer, and academic * Carlos Diego Ferreira (born 1985), Brazilian mixed martial artist ","title":"Carlos Ferreira"},{"id":"21769760","text":"Phillpotts is a surname.

Australia was home to the world's first Green party. The normal environmental movement is represented by a wide range of groups sometimes called non-governmental organizations. These exist on local, national, and international scales. Environmental NGOs vary widely in political views and in the amount they seek to influence environmental policy in Australia and elsewhere. The environmental movement today consists of both large national groups and also many smaller local groups with local concerns. There are also 5,000 Landcare groups in the six states and two mainland territories. In Australia, the movement has seen a growth in popularity through prominent Australian environmentalists such as Bob Brown, Peter Garrett, Steve Irwin, Tim Flannery, and David Fleay. Scope of the movement At a political level, the most influential organisation is the Australian Greens. In recent years the Greens have at times held the balance of power in the Australian Senate. The strongest areas of focus are Landcare, conservation in Australia, clean energy and the Australian anti-nuclear movement. The largest and most influential and active environmental organizations in Australia are World Wildlife Fund, The Wilderness Society, Greenpeace, and the Australian Conservation Foundation. There are also a large number of smaller conservation and advocacy groups. Many groups are involved in active acquisition for conservation as non-profit trusts or covenants to protect of environmentally sensitive land against inappropriate use. The largest of these, in terms of total land area, is Bush Heritage Australia. History The first European settlers of Australia had little regard for the environment of the continent and the early focus was to use the abundant resources and convert the environment into a less hostile and European setting to make settlers feel more at home. The first signs of the environmental movement in Australia began with the growing naturalism movement at the turn of the 19th century. = Early field naturalists = The first naturalists arrived in Australia very early. Joseph Banks, a botanist and naturalist, was a member of First voyage of James Cook and the First Fleet. Despite some significant discoveries by botanists such as Joseph Maiden it wasn't for many decades and with the rapid deterioration of native habitat and growing understanding of the native environment that the first organised clubs began to form. The Field Naturalists Club of Victoria was formed in 1880, followed shortly after by the New South Wales Naturalists Club and Field Naturalists Society of South Australia. A similar organisation was established in Tasmania in 1904. Despite the existence of a strong Victorian era zoological movement, there was little emphasis on conservation or management of the environment and in the early days these naturalists were primarily concerned with cataloguing and academia. = The first national parks = The idea of land conservation began 1879, when the Royal National Park in Sydney was proclaimed. Previously it had been a recreational area; however, it followed the lead of Yellowstone National Park in the United States as a conservation park. As the conservation movement grew, so too did the number of national parks. = Response to endangered species = The thylacine, hunted to extinction in the wild by 1930, sparked public concern for other Australian mammals. In 1908 the Victorian Naturalists Society and the Wilsons Promontory management committee were involved in advocating for the preservation of the thylacine, a species being hunted to extinction in Tasmania. Members of that group went on to establish Healesville Sanctuary. The environmental movement became mainstream with public outcry following extensive culling of koalas. Between 1915 and 1927, nearly 4 million koalas were killed, with the largest cullings occurring in Queensland.Koala research collaboration project By 1924 koalas had officially become extinct in South Australia and endangered elsewhere. In response to the threat of extinction, Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary was opened. Native fauna advisory committees began to be established to address the concern of rapidly dwindling populations of a number of mammal species. In 1928, the Tasmanian Advisory Committee for Native Fauna had recommended a reserve to protect any remaining thylacines, with potential sites of suitable habitat including the Arthur- Pieman area of western Tasmania. This was also the beginning of a Tasmanian wilderness movement. While the movement was too little, too late to save the thylacine from extinction, with the last thylacine dying in captivity in 1936, other species were saved with official protection orders. The koala was declared a protected species in all states in 1937. The Tasmanian devil, another iconic species hunted to the brink of extinction, was protected in 1941. = The landcare movement = While threats to iconic species stimulated the public to act, the conservation movement took some time to grow. Vast areas of Australia were set aside as crown land; however, these were seen as areas of potential development and land use rather than for conservation. Private land use was in general insensitive to native wildlife. The landcare movement in Australia was begun by farmers and has its roots in the 1960s to combat the growing problems of soil erosion and soil salinity which were having an increasing impact in Australia but later also embraced benefits of native biodiversity. Groups of volunteers were formed for projects which promoted revegetation and better resource management. Many of these projects were funded by community groups such as the Returned Services Leagues and Rotary International, or official government programs, such as Land for Wildlife in Victoria or protection of remnant native vegetation through trusts and covenants. Having started locally, the landcare movement gained a national voice in the late 1980s with the foundation of Landcare and later Landcare Australia. Despite increasing awareness of greater environmental issues, however, a growing conflict was occurring between conservationists and farmers. pg 4 = The anti-litter movement = The anti-litter movement also had its roots in the 1960s due to the growing problem in Australia of litter as a form of visual pollution. Keep Australia Beautiful, an industry front group, was founded in 1969 by the packaging industry to shift blame for litter on to consumers. The 1980s \\"Do the right thing\\" campaign successfully helped Coca-Cola avoid scrutiny for bottle pollution resulting from shutting down its sustainable refillable bottling systems. Its Tidy Towns competition became well known in Australia due to it being a very competitive expression of civic pride. Anti-litter and plastic pollution campaigners are now putting responsibility back on to the producers and pushing for corporate responsibility. = The rise of the green movement = The first rumblings of the Australian green movement as a political force came with protests over the Lake Pedder damming project in 1972. The project gained worldwide publicity and brought the environmental movement to the mainstream in Australia. The movement escalated with the Franklin Dam project and Bob Brown was made a martyr for the cause when he was jailed for environmental activism. The protests included the United Tasmania Group who were the precursor to the Tasmanian Greens and are now recognised as the world's first green party. The group that preceded the Tasmanian Wilderness Society, the South West Tasmania Action Committee, continued after the flooding. =Anti-nuclear movement= Nuclear testing, uranium mining and export, and nuclear power have often been the subject of public debate in Australia, and the anti-nuclear movement has a long history. Its origins date back to the 1972–73 debate over French nuclear testing in the Pacific and the 1976–77 debate about uranium mining in Australia.Jim Green. Australia's anti-nuclear movement: a short history Green Left Online, 26 August 1998. Retrieved 15 October 2009.Jason Koutsoukis. Rudd romps to historic win The Age, 25 November 2007. Retrieved 15 October 2009. Several groups specifically concerned with nuclear issues were established in the mid-1970s, including the Movement Against Uranium Mining and Campaign Against Nuclear Energy (CANE), cooperating with other environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth and the Australian Conservation Foundation.Roy McLeod (1995). \\"Resistance to Nuclear Technology: Optimists, Opportunists and Opposition in Australian Nuclear History\\" in Martin Bauer (ed) Resistance to New Technology, Cambridge University Press, pp. 171–173. However, by the late 1980s, the price of uranium had fallen, and the costs of nuclear power had risen, and the anti-nuclear movement seemed to have won its case. CANE disbanded itself in 1988.Roy McLeod (1995). \\"Resistance to Nuclear Technology: Optimists, Opportunists and Opposition in Australian Nuclear History\\" in Martin Bauer (ed) Resistance to New Technology, Cambridge University Press, pp. 175–177. About 2003, proponents of nuclear power advocated it as a solution to global warming and the Australian government began taking an interest. Anti-nuclear campaigners and some scientists in Australia emphasised that nuclear power could not significantly substitute for other power sources, and that uranium mining itself could become a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. = Indigenous land = An increasing consciousness in Indigenous Australian culture and the practices of sustainable landcare also contributed to an overall increase in popularity of the environmental movement and concern for indigenous species. Additionally the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976 which granted indigenous people ownership based on traditional occupation, which effectively locked away large tracts of land from overdevelopment. = 1980s – Major government action = The environmental movement reached a peak in Australia in the 1980s. Popular Australian culture began to embrace the environmental messages of rock bands like Midnight Oil. The sinking of the Rainbow Warrior in New Zealand polarised the community on the green movement. Nuclear testing and whaling in the Pacific region had major impacts on the social consciousness of Australia. The environmental movement also became a hot political issue. The Australian Labor Party, in particular, began to capitalise on the popularity in its election campaigning with a national conservation and soil conservation strategy. In July 1989, Bob Hawke made a famous \\"Our Country, Our Future\\" speech that the Australian Labor Party would plant a billion trees to combat soil erosion and declared the 1990s the \\"Decade of Landcare\\".(22 July 1989) Hawke calls up a billion trees in the battle against soil erosion. News Scientist. Retrieved 5 March 2013. This was a widely popular decision vindicated by the environmental movement. In the same year, the government introduced the Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Act 1989, the focus of which was to eliminate the use of chlorofluorocarbons. The widening hole in the ozone layer was of high concern due to Australia's growing rate of skin cancer incidence. However, with the shift to the Keating Government the economy became the dominant issue and government environmental policy was not a mainstream political issue for over a decade.  Issues  Climate change = Growing concern in Australia about climate change reached its peak in 2006 largely in response to climate change campaigner Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth and once again pushed environmental issues to the forefront. The Howard Government stirred the environmental movement by refusing to acknowledge the Kyoto Protocol and pushing a strongly pro-nuclear power stance. In addition, Howard created controversy by refusing to meet with Gore during his visit to Australia. In contrast, opposition leader Kevin Rudd proclaimed climate change as \\"the greatest moral, economic and social challenge of our time\\" and called for a cut to greenhouse gas emissions by 60% before 2050.Rule of reckless vows The Weekend Australian 27/28 December 2008 page 20 A Newspoll released prior to the 2007 Australian federal election found that the environment was the fourth most important issue to voters behind Medicare, education and the economy.

Viewed as an additive noise, phase noise increases at frequencies close to the oscillation frequency or its harmonics. With the additive noise being close to the oscillation frequency, it cannot be removed by filtering without also removing the oscillation signal. All well-designed nonlinear oscillators have stable limit cycles, meaning that if perturbed, the oscillator will naturally return to its periodic limit cycle. When perturbed, the oscillator responds by spiraling back into the limit cycle, but not necessarily at the same phase. This is because the oscillator is autonomous; it has no stable time reference. The phase is free to drift. As a result, any perturbation of the oscillator causes the phase to drift, which explains why the noise produced by an oscillator is predominantly in phase. Oscillator voltage noise and phase-noise spectra There are two different ways commonly used to characterize noise in an oscillator. Sφ is the spectral density of the phase and Sv is the spectral density of the voltage. Sv contains both amplitude and phase components, but with oscillators the phase noise dominates except at frequencies far from the carrier and its harmonics. Sv is directly observable on a spectrum analyzer, whereas Sφ is only observable if the signal is first passed through a phase detector. Another measure of oscillator noise is L, which is simply Sv normalized to the power in the fundamental. As t → ∞ the phase of the oscillator drifts without bound, and so Sφ(Δf) → ∞ as Δf → 0. However, even as the phase drifts without bound, the excursion in the voltage is limited by the diameter of the limit cycle of the oscillator. Therefore, as Δf → 0 the PSD of v flattens out, as shown in Figure 3(removed due to unknown copyright status). The more phase noise, broader the linewidth (the higher the corner frequency), and the lower signal amplitude within the linewidth. This happens because the phase noise does not affect the total power in the signal, it only affects its distribution. Without noise, Sv(f) is a series of impulse functions at the harmonics of the oscillation frequency. With noise, the impulse functions spread, becoming fatter and shorter but retaining the same total power. The voltage noise Sv is considered to be a small signal outside the linewidth and thus can be accurately predicted using small-signal analyses. Conversely, the voltage noise within the linewidth is a large signal (it is large enough to cause the circuit to behave nonlinearly) and cannot be predicted with small-signal analyses. Thus, small-signal noise analysis, such as is available from RF simulators, is valid only up to the corner frequency (it does not model the corner itself). Oscillators and frequency correlation With driven cyclostationary systems that have a stable time reference, the correlation in frequency is a series of impulse functions separated by fo = 1/T. Thus, noise at f1 is correlated with f2 if f2 = f1 \\\\+ kfo, where k is an integer, and not otherwise. However, the phase produced by oscillators that exhibit phase noise is not stable. And while the noise produced by oscillators is correlated across frequency, the correlation is not a set of equally spaced impulses as it is with driven systems. Instead, the correlation is a set of smeared impulses. That is, noise at f1 is correlated with f2 if f2 = f1 \\\\+ kfo, where k is close to being an integer. Technically, the noise produced by oscillators is not cyclostationary. This distinction only becomes significant when the output of an oscillator is compared to its own output from the distant past. This might occur, for example, in a radar system where the current output of an oscillator might be mixed with the previous output after it was delayed by traveling to and from a distant object. It occurs because the phase of the oscillator has drifted randomly during the time-of-flight. If the time-of-flight is long enough, the phase difference between the two becomes completely randomized and the two signals can be treated as if they are non-synchronous. Thus, the noise in the return signal can be taken as being stationary because it is 'non-synchronous' with the LO, even though the return signal and the LO are derived from the same oscillator. If the time-of-flight is very short, then there is no time for the phase difference between the two to become randomized and the noise is treated as if it is simply cyclostationary. Finally, if the time-of-flight significant but less than the time it takes the oscillator’s phase to become completely randomized, then the phase is only partially randomized. In this case, one must be careful to take into account the smearing in the correlation spectrum that occurs with oscillators.

It's primarily targeted at the educational sector. Veyon is a free and open source software for computer monitoring and classroom management supporting Windows and Linux. The program has been developed as a free alternative to commercial classroom management solutions. It enables teachers to view and control computer labs and interact with students. Veyon is available in many different languages and provides numerous features supporting teachers and administrators at their daily work. Veyon can be used transparently in heterogeneous environments. This means a teacher computer running Linux can easily access student computers running Windows and vice versa.  History  The predecessor project iTALC was started in 2004 and initially available for Linux only. In 2006 and 2007 it was ported to Windows for the Sys-C project of the German city Chemnitz. The further development has been expedited among others through the integration into Univention Corporate Server @ school in 2010. As part of the complete rehaul of iTALC in 2017 the software has been released under the new name Veyon. Veyon differs from its predecessor by a modular architecture as well as many new features such as access control via access control lists, LDAP server support and a new command line utility. Both administrators and users can now consult the new comprehensive administration and user manuals in many different languages.  Technology  Veyon uses an extended version of the VNC protocol to communicate with remote computers. Since Veyon is based on TCP connections, broadcasting screens also works across local network boundaries. Fast and efficient compression algorithms even allow connecting private student computers at home. The Veyon Service needs to be installed on all student computers. The service can't be stopped or uninstalled by students if they do not have administrative privileges. The Veyon Master application running on the teacher computer accesses the service on the student computers. Authentication is performed using RSA keys or by checking user credentials. This way it's ensured only teachers can access student computers.  Features  Features of Veyon include the following: * Overview: monitor all computers in one or multiple locations or classrooms * Remote access: view or control computers to watch and support users * Demo: broadcast the teacher's screen in real-time (full-screen/window) * Screen lock: draw attention to what matters right now * Communication: send text messages to students * Start and end lessons: log in and log out users all at once * Screenshots: record learning progress and document infringements * Programs & websites: launch programs and open website URLs remotely * Teaching material: distribute and open documents, images and videos easily * Administration: power on/off and reboot computers remotely (Wake on LAN)  Compatibility  Veyon is based on the Qt framework and is written in C++. It's therefore available for both Windows and GNU/Linux systems. Support for further platforms and operating systems is being worked on. The usage of Veyon in combination with Edubuntu or Skolelinux (Debian Edu) allows schools all over the world the operation of a free school network.

The book is based on Kavanagh's experience as a young farmer in Monaghan. The novel however is set in Cavan. The story is based on the life of a young farmer poet and his quest for big fields, young women and the meaning of life. Publication history Kavanagh began writing Tarry Flynn in 1940 under the title Stony Grey Soil. It was, however, rejected. After his collection of poetry A Soul for Sale, containing the poem The Great Hunger, was published to great acclaim in February 1947, he set about revising the novel and spent the summer of 1947 working on it. It was published by The Pilot Press in November 1948. The novel was banned by the Irish Censorship Board for being \\"indecent and obscene\\". The ruling was overturned following a challenge by the publisher. The novel was produced as a play at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin in 1966, adapted by P.J O'Connor. It was adapted for the stage again in 1997 by Conall Morrison. The novel was published in Penguin Modern Classics in 2000 with the typographic error \\"Tarry Flyn\\" on the cover and spine.

The Service was dismantled in 2009 and replaced with the newly augmented, retasked and renamed Australian Customs and Border Protection Service which moved from AGD to the newly established Department of Immigration and Border Protection in September 2013. History The Australian Customs Service was created as an independent authority by the Hawke Government in 1985 under the Commonwealth Customs Administration Act 1985 after operating as a departmental entity from 1982 to 1985 within the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce and as the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs Bureau of Customs from 1975 to 1982. In December 2008 then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced that the Australian Government would be augmenting, re-tasking and renaming the Australian Customs Service to create the new Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. Royal assent was given to the changes on 22 May 2009 and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service was established. Role and functions The role of the Australian Customs Service was to prevent the illegal movement of people and harmful goods across Australia's border, and to apply trade measures and collect border-related duties and taxes. Structure Customs was an Australian Public Service agency, staffed by officials who were responsible to the agency's Minister. The responsible minister was the Minister for Home Affairs from 2007 to 2009, the Minister for Justice and Customs from 1998 to 2007, and the Attorney-General of Australia between 1998 and 2007. Between 1 January 2006 and 22 May 2009, the Chief Executive Officer of the agency was Michael Carmody. Lionel Woodward was Chief Executive Officer between 1994 and 2005.

The original White House Mansion was built by Colonel John Lightfoot III just before 1700 and while he was Counselor of State. The White House Plantation was part of a large land holding that John Custis, father of Daniel Parke Custis, purchased from the family of John Lightfoot III. After John Custis died, he left the White House Plantation to his son Daniel Parke Custis, the first husband of Martha Dandridge Custis. The two would marry in 1750. Daniel Parke Custis would unexpectedly die in 1757, leaving the White House Plantation to his wife. After the death of her first husband, Martha Dandridge Custis would later meet George Washington and on January 6, 1759 would hold their wedding ceremony in one of the rooms of the White House Mansion. Union troops stationed at the White House Plantation (of the Army of the Potomac) under the command of George B. McClellan, would burn the second White House to the ground on June 28, 1862, as they retreated during the Seven Days Battles.Horn, Jonathan. \\"White House on the Pamunkey.\\" New York Times. June 29, 2012. Accessed 10-25-2013. The third and final White House burned in 1880. The three White Houses collectively spanned over 180 years. The 2nd and 3rd iterations were smaller than the original White House Mansion. History Prior to the Custis Family = Following the Third Anglo-Powhatan War, the General Assembly began setting up Forts along York River and its tributaries (which are known now as the Pamunkey and Mattaponi Rivers). Captain Roger Marshall was to manage Fort Royal (also known as Rickahock), for three years. After fulfilling the requirements he was granted a patent for the 600 acres of Rickahock (including Fort Royal and any buildings within), on March 14, 1649. That same day he sold these 600 acres of Rickahock to General Manwarring Hammond. These 600 acres brought Gen. Hammond's total landholding patents to 3760 acres on the south side of York River. On the same day as Gen. Hammond received the 600 acres of Rickahock from Capt. Marshall, Colonel Philip Honeywood was granted a patent of 3050 acres. This included 1550 acres above Warrannucock Island (now known as the Pamunkey Indian Reservation) and 1500 acres south side of the York River near the Island. Together the tracts of land owned by Gen. Hammond and Col. Honeywood spanned six square miles. Both men were Royalist Officers who had originally fled England to escape Oliver Cromwell. Once the Restoration (England) came, they left Virginia for home. After leaving for England, the two tracts of land were later conveyed to Captain William Bassett on January 23, 1670 through his correspondence with Colonel Henry Norwood. While the deeds had been lost due to a fire that destroyed New Kent County records, it is thought that Colonel John Lightfoot III purchased the lands from the William Bassett’s Estate around 1686, after he arrived from England with his wife Anne (Goodrich) Lightfoot. Col. John Lightfoot III constructed the White House Mansion prior to 1700. \\"The house was a commodious one, with adequate room for entertainment of a large gathering and guests such as could be provided for by a large Colonial Plantation which had servants aplenty and provisions of all kinds\\". Following Col. John Lightfoot III's death in 1709, his landholdings were divided amongst his sons; Sherwood Lightfoot, Goodrich Lightfoot, and Thomas Lightfoot. According to the diary of Col. William Byrd, there he mentioned Sherwood Lightfoot resided at Rickahock (the southern portion and originally part of Fort Royal) and his younger brother, Goodrich Lightfoot, at the White House Plantation (the northern portion) where the White House Mansion was located. It is unknown what portions of John Lightfoot III's estate went to his youngest son Thomas Lightfoot, and whether any property was given to Col. John Lightfoot's daughter Alice Lightfoot. Location of the White House can be seen on this map along the Pamunkey River. This map from 1863 includes the area in which the White House Plantation is located as well as the 6 square miles of land that the Lightfoots conveyed to the Custis family in the 1700s. John Lightfoot III's total landholdings included acreage he had acquired from William Bassett’s estate. Specifically the Anthony Langston’s plantation, Gen. Hammond’s Fort Royal tract, and land to the east of Manquin Creek. Sherwood Lightfoot would die April 20, 1730. In 1727 Goodrich Lightfoot moved from the White House Plantation to Spotsylvania County and later died in 1738 while living in Orange County. While the records had been lost both Goodrich Lightfoot and Sherwood Lightfoot would convey the entire property of John Lightfoot III to Colonel John Custis (father to Daniel Parke Custis). As of 1735 there are records showing Col. John Custis owned the Old Quarter and the land upon the river. =Antebellum years= A wealthy widow, Martha Custis was courted by George Washington, whom she married in 1759. Shortly thereafter, he resigned his Virginia military commission and they moved to his farm at Mount Vernon in Fairfax County overlooking the Potomac River.John K. Amory, M.D., \\"George Washington’s infertility: Why was the father of our country never a father?\\" Fertility and Sterility, Vol. 81, No. 3, March 2004. (online, PDF format) George and Martha Washington had no children of their own, but raised her two surviving children. Her son, John Parke \\"Jacky\\" Custis (1754–1781) married Eleanor Calvert on February 3, 1774. The couple then moved to the White House plantation. After the couple had lived at the White House plantation for more than two years, John Parke Custis purchased the Abingdon plantation, into which the couple settled during 1778. John Parke Custis died in 1781 after contracting \\"camp fever\\" at the Siege of Yorktown. Martha and George Washington then raised his two younger children, Eleanor Parke Custis (later Lewis) and George Washington Parke Custis (1781–1857). George Washington became the first President of the United States and his wife, Martha, became the nation's initial First Lady, although she was known at the time as simply \\"Lady Washington.\\" The title of First Lady was traditionally given the President's wife in years thereafter. In 1802, George Washington Parke Custis began construction on Arlington House, then in the District of Columbia, intending it to become a memorial to his step- grandfather (and adoptive father), George Washington, who had died in 1799. Arlington House later became the home of his daughter, Mary Anna Randolph Custis, born in 1807, who in 1831 married Robert E. Lee.Perry, John. Mrs. Robert E. Lee : The Lady of Arlington. Multnomah Publishers, 2003. . In 1846, most of the area of the District of Columbia south of the Potomac River was retroceded to Virginia, including the land occupied by Arlington House and the surrounding plantation. Robert E. and Mary Anna Custis Lee had seven children, of whom three boys and three girls survived to adulthood. Of these, the second son was William H.F. \\"Rooney\\" Lee (1837–1891), who was born at Arlington House. Rooney Lee was educated at Harvard University, and then followed his father's footsteps into service with the U.S. Army. However, in 1859, he resigned his commission. Rooney Lee moved to White House Plantation, which he had inherited from his grandfather, who died in 1857. He married Charlotte Wickham, a descendant of attorney John Wickham. They had two children, a boy and a girl, both of whom died in infancy. His wife, Charlotte, died in 1863. The plantation house at White House Plantation, which was burned in 1862, had been the second of three which occupied the site of over the years, all destroyed by fires. White House was the site of the crossing of the Pamunkey River of the Richmond and York River Railroad, which was completed in 1861 between Richmond and West Point, where the Pamunkey and the Mattaponi Rivers converge to form the York River. =American Civil War years= Despite best efforts to preserve the historical home of George and Martha Washington, it was destroyed during the Civil War. When the Civil War broke out in 1861, and Virginia joined the newly formed Confederate States of America, Robert E. Lee, who had most recently been Superintendent of the USMA at West Point was offered the command of all Union forces by U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, but resigned his commission in favor of serving his home state of Virginia. All three of his sons joined him in military service for the Confederacy. Ruins of White House Plantation Robert E. Lee's wife suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, and this became increasingly debilitating with advancing age. By 1861, she was using a wheelchair. Early in the War, Mrs. Lee and her daughters left Arlington House and she was staying at her son Rooney's plantation in New Kent County at White House when Union troops under General George B. McClellan took White House Landing as a supply base during the Peninsula Campaign in 1862, a failed attempt to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond. General McClellan made arrangements for Mrs. Lee's safe passage through the Union lines, and she relocated to Richmond, where she resided at 707 E. Franklin Street (in a still-extant house) for the duration of the War. During the Peninsula Campaign, Frederick Law Olmsted, designer of New York City's Central Park among his many accomplishments, served as Executive Secretary of the U.S. Sanitary Commission, a precursor to the Red Cross in Washington D.C. which tended to the Union wounded during the Civil War. Olmsted headed the medical effort for the sick and wounded at White House Landing until McClellan abandoned it as he retreated with his troops during the Seven Days Battles and shifted his base to Harrison's Landing on the James River. The plantation house of White House Plantation was burned by retreating Union troops. This was not the original White House Mansion. The original White House Mansion built by Col. John Lightfoot III had been removed to \\"make way for the structure which stood on the same site and burned on June 27, 1862\\". =Postbellum years= White House as it appeared when rebuilt after the American Civil War Rooney Lee lost his wife and children during the War, and was captured and held as a prisoner-of-war in New York after the Battle of Brandy Station. Following the War, Rooney Lee returned to White House Plantation. In 1867, he married again. With his second wife, Mary Tab Bolling Lee, he had several children. Nearby, his younger brother Rob lived at Romancoke Plantation across the river in King William County. After his mother died in 1873, Rooney inherited the Ravensworth Estate, the old Fitzhugh family property (near present-day Springfield) in Fairfax County with of land. In 1874, he moved there from White House Plantation. Rooney Lee was elected to the Virginia Senate in 1875, serving until 1878. He was then elected as a Democrat to the US House of Representatives in 1887. He served in the House until his death at Ravensworth in 1891. He is interred in the Lee Chapel at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia with his parents and siblings. Following the Civil War and the burning of the White House Mansion, another similar house was built upon the same foundation. This would be the third and final White House built at the plantation. This house subsequently burned in 1880.  US Park Service Excavation in 1935  A 1935 excavation by the United States Park Service discovered \\"traces of three different houses on the same foundations.\\" These included the original White House Mansion, the second that burned down during the Civil War on 27 June, 1862, and the third that burned in 1880. The oldest bricks were laid in English Bond and were from before 1700. The White House (the Presidents House) in Washington, D.C. Although George Washington and his wife never lived in the presidential mansion now known as the White House in Washington, D.C., construction of the building started during his term in office, and it is speculated that the name may have derived from White House Plantation, where the couple had shared many pleasant memories. \\"It was called White House out of respect for Mrs. Washington's home in Virginia, in which her wedding occurred, and Washington had pleasant memories of that residence and suggested the building of a White House for Presidents.\\" \\"The truth of these statements can be substantiated, that it was called the White House before the War of 1812, but that it was so called as an honor to the White House on the Pamunkey is a very dubious statement. It was a White House and is to this day.\\"  Location of the White House Mansion  The location of the White House Mansion can be found on Google Maps. Based on the aerial image of the area it would that appear that an excavation site can be seen.

It is one of the oldest architecture and engineering firms in the world, and it has designed many landmark buildings in Hong Kong, Shanghai and in southeast Asia.. History Based in Hong Kong, P&T; claims its roots when architect William Salway set up his own practice on 1 October 1868. Herbert William Bird, a partner of the firm from 1901 to 1928, was also a member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. Hong Kong public records suggest that Palmer & Turner arose out of Palmer & Bird – a prominent firm at the time whose senior partner was Lennox Godfrey Bird, younger brother of HW Bird. It is known that Clement Palmer, then only 23 years of age, designed the first Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Building in 1883. Arthur Turner, a structural engineer, joined the firm in 1884. From 1891 onwards, the name Palmer and Turner was kept, despite the arrival of new partners. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the practice was very active in colonial Hong Kong, and in Shanghai, which was a treaty port at the time. A Shanghai office of Palmer and Turner was opened in the mid-1920s, and it designed many important buildings that constitute the Old Bund in Shanghai, including the Peace Hotel. Following a rule change by the architects' professional body, HKIA, in 1981, after which full liability partnerships could incorporate, the practice was incorporated and renamed P&T; Group in 1982. Its holding company, which owns all its offices premises and practices, was transferred into a trust protecting its owners, with rules determining dividends, and the reinvestment of profits within the company. The company's fortunes have waxed and waned over the years. During the Asian financial crisis, its headcount was pruned from 800 employees down to 450. In China, business has fallen from its peak in the 2000s, when the mainland accounted for over half its revenues, to less than 30 per cent, the firm shrunk from some 2,000 employees to just over 1,600. Heinz Rust, one of the P&T; directors responsible for the changes at the time, said the new company was “streamlined” to suit expansion plans. The company expanded internationally since around 2000, opened new offices in Dubai(2004), Wuhan(2005), Abu Dhabi(2007), Ho Chi Minh City(2008), Chongqing(2012), Indonesia(2014) and Shenzhen(2016). = 1860s–1900s: Early years = Chartered Bank, Hong KongThe origins of the P&T; Group date back to 1868, with founder William Salway's arrival in Hong Kong from Australia, to establish a design practice in response to the demand for grander buildings. In 1880s, the Beaconsfield Arcade was completed, Hong Kong’s first multi-storey shopping centre. Architect, Clement Palmer and structural engineer Arthur Turner joined the partnership. In 1890s, the company name changed to Palmer & Turner, the name remained for nearly a century. = 1900s–1950s: Growth and expansion = HSBC ShanghaiIn 1920s, the Shanghai office was opened.

It was first performed at the Theatre Royal, Bury St. Edmunds, England, on 21 April 2005.Soans, Robin. “Talking to Terrorists.” Oberon Books Ltd., 2005. London, UK. The play is written in the style of verbatim theatre where all of the dialogue is taken from real interviews and then recreated on stage. The play discusses the importance of resolving terrorism not with violence or conflict, but with negotiations and peaceful discussions. Context Robin Soans took a year to write Talking to Terrorists, he wanted to bring light to an important issue he discovered while undertaking interviews. He mentions in the preface to his play that a relief worker had arrived at a village which had been recently destroyed. When the relief worker talked with the villagers, the relief worker discovered that the villagers were not angry because they were hungry and homeless, but because they had a story that no one would listen to. The relief worker mentioned to Soans, \\"A huge part of what we call terrorism arises from no-one listening.\\" Soans wanted to emphasise not just the unheard stories of former terrorists throughout the play, but he wanted the audience to hear the tales of everyone involved and affected by terrorism. Plot synopsis The play opens up with SS1 and her husband discussing terrorism as a whole, Phoebe and Edward then discuss children involved in terrorism and the politics of it. Phoebe leaves and Edward talks about the difficulties of being a young Muslim in Luton, which leads to a sort of flashback conversation between four Muslim boys named Momsie, Aftab, Faiser, and Jab. After Edward's conversation, the five ex-terrorists (formerly members of the Irish Republican Army, the Ulster Volunteer Force, the Kurdish Workers Party, the National Resistance Army from Uganda, and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade from Bethlehem) discuss their stories involving where they grew up and how they first became involved with terrorism. The four men and one woman exchange tales about their early years, some went to prison the majority of their young lives, while others held meetings with their groups members to discuss issues in their communities and governments. Act One ends with the Bethlehem schoolgirl talking about her life in Israel around Christmas and how she feels hostility towards local soldiers. Act Two begins with the ex-ambassador and his partner Nodira talking about the ambassador's duties. They recollect the first time the two met and the conflict of interests their relationship had on the ambassador's profession. The ex-ambassador also discusses the military's intelligence and their reliance upon information gathered through torture. He states his concern in a letter sent to London, which reads, “we are selling our souls for dross.”Soans, Robin. “Talking to Terrorists.” Oberon Books Ltd., 2005. London, UK. Page 70 The ex-ambassador specifically states later that the evidence gathered under torture is incorrect and is morally wrong for London to support the American position by working with and using the American information. The play goes into a flashback of the ex-ambassador's earlier years when he discusses with Linda, Matthew, and Michael about London's information sharing, this conversation eventually leads the ambassador to come to the conclusion that it would be immoral to continue in his role. Soans ex-Ambassador is based on verbatim quotes from Craig Murray, the former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, and his wife Nadira. Murray later used much of this material in his memoir Murder in Samarkand (2006). It was used again by Sir David Hare for his play Murder in Samarkand. Genre Talking to Terrorists is written in the form of verbatim theatre which consists of actors repeating the same words, movements, and accents that had been previously recorded in an interview or court hearings. This style of theatre allows the audience to see the characters as genuine people rather than fictitious creations. All of the characters in Talking to Terrorists consist of actual interviews from ex- members of terrorist groups, politicians, military officials, and victims of terrorism. Style The style of Talking to Terrorists is realism, since all of the characters, sets, and words involved with the play come from real events, places, and people. David Rush describes realism as, “a style that attempts to depict life on stage as it is actually lived by the members of the audience.”Rush, David. \\"A Student Guide to Play Analysis.\\" Southern Illinois Printing Press, 2005. Carbondale, IL. p191. Realism in this play truly depicts life, since the events and characters represent real people and their stories. This sort of docudrama/verbatim theatre play feeds off of its ability to “live in a world like ours… [and] appear logical and believable.” Rush also explains that realism applies to three rules, the unity of time, place, and action to be perceived as believable.Rush, David. \\"A Student Guide to Play Analysis.\\" Southern Illinois Printing Press, 2005. Carbondale, IL. p192. Unity of Time: Talking to Terrorists involve actual dialogues from actual people that occur in a constant flow of real time, essentially meaning that all of the stories happen in real time, rather than the course of several days, thus creating the impression on the audience that all of the events are unfolding before them in the course of two hours. Unity of Place: All of the characters come into the same space and more often than not, the same set, and by doing so creates a reality for the audience that the locations do not change randomly, and the audience is viewing a real space in front of them. Unity of Actions: The play tells essentially on plot from the perspective of several characters, although they all tell different stories, the play itself follows only one plot without any sort of subplot. Because Soans’ play follows these three unities, the play is considered realism in both a literal and technical sense.

It is overall a medium-brown color, lacks thorns on the disc and has indistinct thorns on the tail. It was discovered in 2002 during a National Marine Fisheries Service survey, and first described in 2004. The holotype specimen is held at the University of Washington. Its species name \\"mariposa\\" derives from the Spanish word for butterfly, although several other species are sometimes referred to as the \\"butterfly skate.\\" Description Bathyraja mariposa is a medium-sized skate relative to other Alaska skates, measuring approximately 0.76 meters total length. It has a lengthy snout and moderately long tail and lacks a pseudosiphon in the claspers. It is morphologically similar to two other Alaskan skates, Bathyraja violacea and Rhinoraja taranetzi, but can be distinguished based on coloration patterns. B. mariposa is green-brown on the dorsal side of the disc, with small dark brown or black blotches on disc and tail. Large yellowish blotches usually appear on the surface of the pectoral fins. The dorsal surface of the disc has uniformly dense coverage of dermal denticles. Ecology Bathyraja mariposa has been estimated to have a population density of approximately 0.34 individuals per square kilometer in the Aleutian islands. Trawl surveys have not uncovered this species outside of that region and appears to be found principally in the central Aleutians. It is believed to be benthopelagic, found in waters 90 – 448 meters deep.

The book, Spencer's fourth, was adapted in 2000 into a film of the same name, starring Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly. Plot introduction The book is a love story about two passionate liberals with vastly different approaches to their ideologies: Fielding Pierce is a lawyer and aspiring politician, and Sarah Williams is a social activist who despises the political system. During a mission to assist Chilean refugees, Williams is killed by a terrorist car-bomb. Years later, Pierce is offered the Democratic candidacy for an Illinois congressional seat, but during the campaign Pierce becomes convinced he has seen and heard Williams on several occasions. As Pierce becomes obsessed with finding out if his lost lover is alive, he is pushed to the brink of insanity and begins to fear he has become fully absorbed and changed by the political system Williams so hated. Reception Waking the Dead was eagerly anticipated following Spencer's previous novel, the 1979 novel Endless Love. Michiko Kakutani, book reviewer for The New York Times compared Waking the Dead to the 1976 Brian De Palma film Obsession. Both feature male protagonists who lose their lover to a violent death, then later believe they have been brought back to life. Although Kakutani said Spencer succeeded in fleshing out Pierce's world (including his upbringing and family life), in her view the author was less successful in convincing the readers of Pierce's love for Williams. Kakutani said, \\"his orchestration of Fielding's continuing obsession with Sarah becomes an increasingly empty display of narrative pyrotechnics\\". Kakutani also said the first-person narration Spencer mastered in Endless Love, was less successful in Waking the Dead and occasionally \\"tend[s] to come across as simple-minded or phony digressions\\". Paul Gray, of Time Magazine, said the Pierce character was too unlikeable, citing his \\"overweening self-pity (and) penchant for purple prose.\\" Film adaptation Film director Keith Gordon, who adapted Waking the Dead into a film, first read the book in 1991 and knew he wanted to make it into a movie before he finished it. Gordon said he was especially touched by a scene in which Pierce is on a plane taking Williams' body home and silently wishing the plane would crash: \\"I started to cry and I thought, I want to tell this story. I'll never forget the chill that ran through me. Then I finished the book and I was sure I had to tell it. I saw it. I saw what it looked like, I saw what it sounded like, I suddenly pictured what the cinematography would be like.\\" Gordon said he particularly identified with Fielding Pierce, and saw parallels between in Pierce's feelings for Williams and Gordon's own love for his wife: \\"I can imagine if I ever lost Rachel that I would be devastated and go mad and have to work my way back to appreciating what I had gotten from her instead of dwelling on the loss.\\" Gordon remained so faithful to the book during his adaptation that the first cut of the movie was three hours long; he shortened it to 105 minutes by trimming subplots, stories and unnecessary scenes.

In the First Anglo-Burmese War, Maha Ne Myo led the Burmese forces after the death of Gen. Maha Bandula in April 1825 until his own death in the battle of Prome on 2 December 1825. His death effectively ended any expectations the Burmese had of driving out the British, and was followed by the Treaty of Yandabo in February 1826 that ended the war strictly on British terms. Battle of Prome After Maha Bandula's death on 1 April 1825 in the battle of Danubyu, the remaining Burmese forces retreated to Upper Burma. The British, led by Gen. Archibald Campbell, took Prome (Pyay), the traditional border town between Upper Burma and Lower Burma, on 4 April 1825. The British decided to consolidate their gains in Lower Burma throughout the monsoon season. Peace negotiations that began in September broke down by early October after the Burmese would not agree to British terms. The British had demanded no less than the complete dismemberment of the Burmese western territories in Arakan, Assam, Manipur and the Tenasserim coast as well as two million pounds sterling of indemnity. The Burmese would not agree to give up Arakan and the large sum of indemnity. In November 1825, the Burmese decided to throw everything they had in a one last-ditch effort. Starting in mid- November, the Burmese forces, consisted mainly of Shan regiments led by their sawbwas, threatened Prome in a daring circular movement that almost surrounded the town and cut off communications lines to Yangon. In the end, the superior firepower of the British guns and missiles won out. On 1 December, Gen. Campbell, with 2500 European and 1500 Indian sepoys, supported by a flotilla of gun boats, attacked the main Burmese position outside Prome. On 2 December, Maha Ne Myo was killed by a shell launched from the flotilla. After Maha Ne Myo's death, the British dislodged the Burmese by 5 December. The defeat in Prome effectively left the Burmese army in disarray. The Burmese army was in constant retreat from then on. By February 1826, the Burmese were forced to accept the British terms to end the war.

Yoshiki Nakamura has created a fictional world giving the country of Japan an alternate reality featuring imaginary actors, singers and other entertainers. The heroine, Kyoko Mogami, attempts to become a star in show business to get revenge on Shō Fuwa. As the protagonist surmounts obstacles on her journey to stardom, new situations and characters are introduced. Main charactersKyoko Mogami= : (anime), Ivy Chen (live-action) :Instead of staying home and attending high school in Kyoto, travels with her childhood friend Shō Fuwa to Tokyo to help him while he makes it big as an idol. When she finds out that he only invite her so she could be his maid, her heart and innocence are shattered. Her box opened (Pandora's Box) and it set free a lot of little demon's that looked like Kyoko, (they often stick onto other people and make them unable to move, choke them, or scare them to death. The surviving Angels in Kyoko's body try to suppress them but they get overpowered by the demons and so Kyoko sets free a scary aura). More vengeful than depressed, she swears to avenge herself. Shō comments the only way to do this would be to beat him in show business, so that's what she decides to do. She changes her hair style and begins the task of applying to Shō's rival company (Akatoki Agency), L.M.E. While her audition stood out (she performed katsura), the president of the company realized that she lacked the key point needed to become an idol: love, as without genuine love for this profession and for the audience, she cannot make it far in this world. However, despite her failure, she had such an impressionable audition that Kyoko is given a second chance. The L.M.E. \\"Love Me\\" section is thus founded. Lory makes a deal with Kyoko that if she wholeheartedly completes all the jobs given to her as a Love-Me employee to the client's satisfaction (which is determined by how many points they stamp onto her record book), by the end of a certain period of time, when she has accumulated enough points, she will be given a grand debut. Thus begins her journey into the show business world. :As an actress, Kyoko is unrefined but creative and spontaneous, able to impress talent scouts with her unique talents and improvisations. In her earlier jobs, she utilizes the skills she learned from working in an inn in Kyoto Prefecture (like cooking, walking \\"properly,\\" and performing a traditional tea ceremony) to act the part of a wealthy, cultured lady. Though passionate and hot-tempered, Kyoko is able to show impressive professionalism and discipline when it comes to acting, even to the point of putting the job before her health. When forced to perform a tea ceremony in a movie scene with Ren, she is able to keep a serene face and act her part while kneeling on a badly fractured ankle. Yet despite the pain, she refuses to get up or stop until the scene is completed. Because of this, the director and everyone else was incredibly awed by her determination and strength. Later on, Shuhei (Kuu), Ren's father, says she was a \\"scary kind of actress,\\" much like Ren. Her debut was for a soft drink commercial. Kyoko never liked to drink soda (even as a child) but she made herself drink it for the important commercial audition. Her first major role was Mio, the antagonist in the television drama Dark Moon. :Her character, disregarding her acting capabilities is shown to be very pure regardless of whether she's in a good or a bad mood, as seen when she was fuming after Shō stole her first kiss when she was hoping for her first kiss to be like what it was in fairy tales. Not long after that, she's thrown into a huge dilemma over Ren's attempted kiss on her cheek to get Shō out of her mind (which is now replaced with Ren and couldn't concentrate on the Dark Moon set later on). Before Ren tries to prove that the kiss doesn't have any hidden intentions behind it by stating that \\"Foreigners express their affection often using actions\\", Kyoko thought that Ren was a playboy, but has since retracted her statement because she believed his reasoning. :Kyoko has a fondness for cosmetics, fairy tales (aforementioned are linked to princesses) and anything magical (she was raised in a very strict manner due to being part of an inn, and thus such tales are one of the ways where she would get away from it), as seen when Kanae gave her a rare cosmetics set as a present on her birthday, which is December 25th. :She becomes a regular in a show wearing a chicken suit for the character \\"Bo\\". She assumes this character on several occasions to talk to Ren, because he won't open up about his problems to anyone he knows. As Kanae is her first true friend, she likes to cling on to her and calls her \\"Moko\\"(because Kanae uses 'Mo' often as an interjection) (she doesn't have any friends before then because every girl hated Kyoko for her familiarity with Shō). :When she is in her room in \\"Darumaya\\" she is often seen explaining how she would exact revenge on the two men that make her life miserable to a large poster of Shōtaro and a small photo of Ren, the picture becomes much larger as the story progresses (the size of the picture reflects her level of hatred towards the person on it). She also carries with her many curse dolls of Ren and Shō, which she uses to vent her anger and perform curses. The dolls, incredible in the attention to detail, are handmade by Kyoko. They feature Shō and Ren in various state of fear, distress and submission. After her relationship with Ren improves, she often 'consults' her Ren doll during times of stress. :Kyoko seems to have a bad relationship with her parents. Her mother, Saena, was a strict and emotionally distant parent who eventually left her with the Fuwa family when Kyoko was still six. The effects of Kyoko's difficult childhood can be seen throughout the series, particularly in her acting. For example, when she was acting with Maria, she stated that parents that despise their children really exist. Kyoko's father has been absent throughout the series. As her parents were not able to give her love, she followed Shō with all her heart (before the start of the series), but after his betrayal, she has lost all hope and became very cynical when it comes to love and thus it is a taboo subject for her, with the slightest mention of it getting her all angry and depressed. Valentine's Day is also the most hated occasion for her, and she believes that all girls who give chocolate to men out of love will end up like her. :Kyoko has a noticeable crush on Ren later in the series but she mistakes it for respect sometimes and even denies it since she \\"couldn't possibly let herself fall in love again\\". After seeing the certain scene where \\"Katsuki\\" (played by Ren) is looking at the girl he loves in the play, Kyoko remembers the smile (he has shown it for her a couple of times before) and comes to the conclusion that Ren might not hate her or dislike her, as she thought before. It is shown that Kyoko does not know that Ren is \\"Corn\\" her \\"fairy-prince\\". Recently, she was the caretaker for Kuu (aka Shuhei), an actor who played in the previous version of the drama \\"Dark Moon\\". He is also Ren's father, although Kyoko does not know this. :After Dark Moon started airing, Kyoko was cast in a high school drama as Natsu, which is a \\"Bully Role\\"; however Kyoko runs into the problem of being type-cast, as the director asks her to do her \\"Natsu\\" role based on \\"Mio\\". This is in spite of the fact that two roles should be different, as Mio is an extremely embittered rich young heiress, while Natsu is a relatively normal girl from a normal family who merely likes to pick on her classmates. But after some training from Ren on \\"how to act like a model\\" she stuns the cast with her new appearance and attitude for the role of Natsu, easily impressing the director with this new representation of Natsu. :Later on, Kyoko was given a job by the president that she was to meet a scary person by the name of Cain Heel, who turns out to be Ren, who is into his character so much to the extent that Kyoko fell due to fear. After the incident, Ren confronted her and revealed who he was. He brought her back to the president and the president bestowed a job to Kyoko; she was to act as Cain Heel's younger sister, Setsuka, or better known as Setsu. She was given a complete makeover to complete the role of Cain's sister. :Kyoko was trying to find the correct method to portray Setsu, and was unable to get fully into character, as seen when she was tremendously worried about Ren (as Cain Heel)'s safety while he's fighting off 4 guys who attacked him after his refusal to allow them to hit on Kyoko (as Setsuka Heel) and when she was yelling at Ren to stop when he was about to lose it and injure one badly, which is different from her previous characters, when she's fully in character as Mio and Natsu even while off-set, and continued to act as Kuon even while meeting Ren and Yashiro at Sunrise TV. More recently, Kyoko has started to realize her \\"new feelings\\" for Ren. In one monologue, she talks about how all the locks on her \\"box,\\" except onem fell off when Ren kissed her on the cheek. However, she was able to put them back on and seal back up her \\"box.\\" She goes on to say that at the moment Ren took her hands and said \\"let's do this together,\\" most of the locks came off easily. Kyoko constantly denies these feelings to herself, trying to convince herself (somewhat unsuccessfully) that Ren sees her as a child and not as a love interest. :Now, she seems to have 'found Setsu', as she is completely in character, even going so far as to walk into the bathroom when Ren (acting as Cain) is taking a bath, shocking the director who was the one who 'created' the character 'Cain Heel'. Previously, when she accidentally walked in on Ren while he was showering (she was worried about him since he wouldn't answer her) she panicked for a long time, though she covered it in front of Ren, causing him to wonder if she saw him as a man. :Currently, she's trying to find a way to help Ren come out of the darkness that's haunting him (his past). While on a break from acting as Setsuka, she is pondering over the situation and wonders if someone has lost their life because of Ren, though she never finishes the thought since Kijima (a well known actor whose interest in Kyoko is obvious to everyone but her) texts her. :After begin captured by Shō with the help of Mimori, Kyoko is forced to go to lunch with him, where after concerned with her punctuality makes him give her a lift to her next job (TMB). But when she meets eyes with an unexpected Ren Tsuruga who also has work there, Shō makes Kyoko tell him her real feelings for Ren Tsuruga. She tells Shō that she feels nothing for him and states \\"I don't want to turn into an idiot [(fall in love)] again. [...] and even if I were to become an idiot again for some reason... it still... wouldn't be because of Tsuruga-san\\" in chapter 191. Kyoko arrives at her job to play Bo still late even after the whole ordeal, Kyoko admits to herself that if she were to allow herself to become an \\"idiot\\" again she would be worse of an idiot with Tsuruga than she ever was with Shō. :The next day Kyoko is nervous because she knows that Tsuruga is bound to be angry at her but when she doesn't receive even a phone call, she can't help but worry. But now she must suppress the unwanted feelings and return to being Setsuka Heel and live with her awaiting dotting older brother and beloved senpai who is still dealing with his suppressed unresolved feeling of dismay (he's really mad at this point because of Kyoko's text message to Kijima, and seeing her with Shō) and the shadows which lurk from his past. :At first things appear normal between the Heel siblings in the hotel room. Setsu finds Cain lolling on an armchair and comments that Cain need not have waited for her in such an uncomfortable position. Cain replies that he gets restless when she's not with him and adds that he should \\"tie her up in chains so that she would think of nothing but him.\\" Setsu remarks that it was a good idea but was interrupted by her cell phone ringing. She apprehensively picks it up, guessing it is Shō. :Cain notices her flustered expression and takes the phone. He realizes as well that the call is from Fuwa and flings it away in a fit of anger. The phone breaks and Shō is no longer able to make the call. :Shō spends some time ruminating over what could have possibly happened. By this time he has got cold feet over his actions as they might drive Kyoko closer to his rival. :Meanwhile, Ren angrily confronts Kyoko about the phone call and her meeting earlier with Shō. Kyoko freezes as she realizes that the person before her is not the Ren Tsuruga she knows. She starts to back away and falls on the bed. Ren pins her down and continues to question her. He gets depressed as he feels that Kyoko's lack of response is a confirmation of a rekindled relationship with Fuwa. :Kyoko then surprises him by flipping him over and straddling him. She didn't want Ren to fall into the darkness that she believes herself to be in. She wants him to possibly, remain on a pedestal, where she would never be able to reach him. She decides to tackle the situation at hand by continuing to act as Setsu, and teases Cain about his unreasonable jealousy. She assures him that it was nothing important. Cain was her most important person and for the first time in the manga Kyoko takes the initiative to kiss Ren on the forehead. :At this point, a stunned Kuon is brought to his senses. He realizes he broke character and immediately switches over to Cain, to Kyoko's relief. :Setsu comments that her lipstick mark was stuck on his head. Cain replied it wasn't permanent and so Setsu unzips his jacket, offering to make a permanent one on his chest. Kyoko used this scene from an old adult movie she had seen with Shōtaro where the girl sensually took off the man's shirt. :However, Kyoko starts to freak out now as she has no idea how to make a kiss mark and bites Ren's neck hard instead. Cain advises her on how to do it properly, and this angers Kyoko as she realizes that Ren must have had a lot of experience with other women. She hides her jealousy and continues as Setsu, saying that Cain will always be in her heart. She proceeds to kiss his neck at the same spot and lightly sucks it. Cain then assures her that he will never break out of character again or disappoint her. For him, too, she is his most important person in his heart. :At this point Kyoko looks up blushing. She realizes she has the wrong expression on her face but is immediately flipped over by Cain who offers to make a kiss mark on her shoulder as proof of his promise and also as a lesson on the proper technique. :Setsu stops him saying coldly that she does not want to experience the techniques that he has learnt from another woman. She pushes him away and gets off the bed saying she will find other men to practice on. Cain stops her and she replies she was only joking and wanted to go shopping for breakfast. Cain makes her stay in the room and goes out alone. In the elevator he finally accepts his true self. Ren and Kuon merge and a new Ren Tsuruga is born. :In recent chapters, Kyoko has subconsciously broken character while playing Setsu. In chapter 199, she has gotten mad at Ren (while playing Cain) because he touched/pat another girl's head/hair causing the girl to fall head over heels in love with Cain. She breaks character when she hides the fact that she is mad, something she did all the time in the past with Shō. Her character, Setsu would have been openly mad and Kyoko realizes this. She realizes also that her feelings for Ren which she had been denying for so long were starting to show through and it scares her. She thinks that he won't return her feeling and will be disappointed in her. She sees these feelings as poisonous and tries to bottle them up again. In chapter 200 however, her feelings accidentally show through while Ren acting as Cain is trying to comfort her and the L.M.E. president disguised as a construction worker sees. Kyoko is worried that he will tell Ren now. However, after a private chat with the president, Kyoko comes to terms with her feelings with Ren and accepts them, seeming more at peace now that she had done so. The locks on her box have been shown to all be off. After finally confronting the enigmatic figure of her mother, named Saena, in-person for the first time, Kyoko questions her for some explanation behind her life-long hatred. Her mother agrees, and says she'll spare nothing. Kyoko acknowledges her feelings might be hurt, and learns the sad story of her conception & that she is an abortion survivor (Saena is weak from depression for months before discovering her pregnancy; after going to clinics & hospitals for one willing to perform an abortion, none will perform the procedure due to her frail state. Saena passed the legal 6month limit & tried to commit suicide instead, and she & Kyoko were saved by concerned coworkers). Kyoko learns from her mother all about the dastardly man that betrayed her & work circumstances that drove her to unimaginable depths of despair and hatred. Kyoko tells her mother \\"I like this life of mine.\\" and says she wishes she could stop hoping for Saena's love, but she can't, and she won't stop trying. She says \\"One day, you'll be proud to say I'm your daughter!\\" and asks Saena to pat her on the head and tell her Good Job on that day. Saena responds, eyes watering slightly, \\"If that's what you want...\\" =Ren Tsuruga= :, Siwon (live-action) : is, in outward appearances, an extremely nice and polite star. However, he shows his true self whenever he deals with Kyoko. He was originally unhappy with Kyoko, because she joined show business for revenge. However, he gradually warms up towards her. Realizing that she isn't just trying to become an actress for revenge and supports her growth as a budding idol. Although at times teasing, he is in love with Kyoko. For example, he does not allow himself to be near her alone sometimes, because the urge to hold her is increasing. (In volume twelve, when Kyoko falls, after trying to get a pot from the cabinet and, instead of crashing into the chair she was standing on, Ren catches her and hugs her despite himself). He quickly recovered so that Kyoko would not discover his mistake. He has also hugged her in Act 98–99 after Reino, Kyoko's stalker, tells her that \\"Corn\\" might be dead; not wanting to see Kyoko cry and, as a result of another one of his urges, he holds her tight and tells her that Corn, her childhood friend, is fine. He also hates Shō Fuwa, because of his ties to Kyoko. Some of the people closest to him have begun to notice his feelings for Kyoko, namely, Ren's manager, Yashiro, and the agency's president, Takarada. :Although he frequently dated in the past and has had a lot of girlfriends, he actually had zero experience with love. This fact caused him to struggle a great deal while defining his character's role in Dark Moon. :At the age of twenty, Ren has lived a large portion of his life in America. In fact, he began his acting career in the United States, albeit disastrously. Although he gained experience, he was fired so often that he has lost count, an experience which is in sharp contrast to the staunch and disciplined actor he is today. Fortunately, his past in America is unknown to the public as Ren Tsuruga is only a stage name. He is the son of a famous actor named Kuu Hizuri and his mother's name is Julie. Although there are hints of a dark past, his earlier years are shrouded in mystery (though it is noted that when he was in his teens, he felt a lot of pressure from his parents and therefore escaped from America to Japan). It has recently been revealed that he is constantly tormented by the death of his best friend, which he believes is his fault (though from the flashbacks it looks as though it was an unfortunate accident). Recent chapters show that his real name is . Back when he was a kid, he became friends with Kyoko. But to this day, Kyoko still pronounces his name wrong, calling him \\"Corn,\\" though that is actually due to her memory of his name being \\"Corn\\" since their time as children. It is shown that at her current age, Kyoko pronounces his name as \\"Kuon\\" as what is seen at the end of Chapter 105 when Kuu Hizuri asked Kyoko to act as his son. :It has been shown repeatedly that Ren detests Shō more than anyone else, as seen when he became very angry after seeing \\"Hatred\\" written on one of Kyoko's chocolates because he assumed that those are for Shō. :Ren's birthday is February 10th, but Kyoko thought it was the 19th, because of a typo. She had ordered a present for him and asked if he would still accept it on the fourteenth. Ren said, \\"Of course, but I would be very happy Mogami-san smile for me as a present.\\" Around this time, Ren received a lot of Valentine's Day chocolates that he decided not to eat because he'll feel like he'll have to eat all of them. Yashiro-san said he liked his fair attitude, but what if Kyoko made him chocolates, what would he do then? He doesn't get chocolates from her which makes him mad at first but later receives wine jelly from her which makes him happy that he reassures he won't be swayed by her actions. After Shō kissed Kyoko, he at first seems mean to her by snorting and saying she was acting stupid, but later tries to convince Kyoko what had happened was not a kiss. He later reveals his real intentions by warning to never let it happen again with a scary face. At the end of chapter 148, it appears as though he may kiss her. He does, but on the cheek, spiraling Kyoko into more worries. Ren seems to enjoy this a bit too much, knowing all too well that Kyoko can't put his kiss on the cheek out of her mind, which is true. He may be closest male that Kyoko allow her heart to open up to without knowing themselves. :He has been described and shown to be experienced in martial arts to a certain degree, described when his father Kuu Hizuri went with a shower of praises when asked by Kyoko to name him one of his characteristics while trying to act as Kuon, and shown in flashbacks when Kuon single-handedly beat up several guys who had been bullying him, and when he (as Cain Heel) handled four guys who attacked him after he stopped them from hitting on Kyoko (as Setsuka Heel). =Shō Fuwa= : (anime), Donghae (live-action) :With his real name being , keeps it a secret because he finds it a very old-fashioned and traditional name. He is a typical stuck-up star and is also very ruthless. Shō had no qualms about tricking Kyoko into going with him to Tokyo so she could be a free servant for him. He also had even less qualms about being extremely cruel to her when she discovered this. Shō eventually figured out that Kyoko was in L.M.E. and was surprised to see her transformation. It is also revealed that he has more feelings for her than he originally thought, such as in Act. 82 when he personally brought some medical cream for the cut in Kyoko's face (caused by him), and apologized sincerely. Most notably during the Dark Moon shoot over a resort, Kyoko's stalker Reino announced in front of Shō, that he plans to steal her away from him. Reino from the band Vie Ghoul had stolen one of Shō's music sheets/songs previously planning to use it for their own success. When Reino chased Kyoko through the forest, Shō followed pursuit and was the one who protected Kyoko even calling Kyoko \\"his woman\\". Also, he tells Reino that he would not give up his position as the person Kyoko thinks about the most even if the emotion she feels for him is hatred. However this moment was not witnessed by Kyoko. Also, when confronted by Kyoko as to why he continues to help her, despite being enemies, he almost confesses that he loves her before being interrupted by Ren, who didn't want Shō to get close to Kyoko. Despite his ruthless and cold personality, Shō has a sense of humor that he keeps buried deep down, nearly busting a gut laughing in private to Kyoko's mispronouncing Vie Ghoul as Beagle. As Kyoko once commented, Shō has loved comedy Shōws on TV since they were both kids. :Initially, Shō acted with a general possessiveness for Kyoko, who had been his constant companion and servant since childhood. Further on in the series though, Shō begins to show a kinder side to her and hints that he has real feelings as opposed to just possessive feelings. Once he finds out that Ren Tsuruga is in love with Kyoko too, he gets extremely angry. Shō thinks of Ren as his rival and is extremely petty at times when they meet, even going as far as to pick a fight with him. Shō is also a big flirt and can be very shallow. He tends to like older women, but he is fine with women with big breasts and oozing pheromones. Shō has disliked Ren because he is the coolest guy in Show Biz. Shō says he's going to steal all of Ren's fans and the title of \\"The Coolest Male Celebrity\\" from him. :Despite his nature, Shō's talent as a singer is in fact, quite good. Shō's original songs attracted many fans as well as his looks, but that did not stop from these fans from quickly falling in love with the copy-cat band Vie-Ghoul. With the sudden revelation that his fans could easily leave him for another band if the sound was the same, Shō was deeply troubled that he could be surpassed so easily. With some unintended help/lecture from Kyoko, Shō realizes the deep feelings he has had for the situation and decides to put his heart into his singing. His consistent release of new hit songs signifies he is rising to the top of his singing career, devastating Kyoko. He has gone so far as being \\"untouchable\\" by the Vie-Ghoul, as their spy had stopped stealing Shō's lyrics due to new found respect and love for his job and Shō's determination to become a star. :Also, Shō has been extremely jealous (yet constantly denies this) after the order of Kyoko's chocolates got mixed up into saying that she loved the leader of Vie-Ghoul (where they actually stated she was annoyed at him). Because of this, he believes that Kyoko is in love with the Leader, someone he considers worse than Ren and is \\"unacceptable\\". Shō has gotten so angry that he takes on the appearance of Japanese demons. So in an effort to prove he is not jealous, he buys a very large bouquet of flowers as a \\"congrats\\" present to them. However, after discovering that Kyoko does not in fact love Reino, he forcefully kisses her, stunning the Dark Moon cast. :When Kyoko yells at him and pushes him away, Shō smirks at Ren. Ren is very angry, but manages to keep his emotions under control. According to Shō, he wanted a taste of the expensive chocolate he gave her and kissed her to get a piece of it from her mouth. Shō then walks away, confident that he has reassured his place as the one who has the biggest place in her heart even though she hates him. It is noted that Kyoko and Shō have an inescapable bond that can't be cut or replaced as they often meet under sudden circumstances. Most of the people who have developed feelings for Kyoko or Shō feel that they can't come between them. :Recently, in an attempt to keep Kyoko from falling in love with Ren, Shō has tricked Kyoko into making a bet that if she falls in love with Tsuruga Ren, she has to give up her dream of being an actress and return to their hometown and become a waitress in his parents' inn for life. He does this knowing fully well that, it would be the last thing that Kyoko would actually want and so she would resist falling in love with Ren. Supporting characters ; :, Bianca Bai (live-action) :Kotonami's character, at first glance, looks like she was being set up to be the villain to Kyoko's heroine, but as with all of the female characters in this series, Kanae is much more sympathetic than she appears. While there was fur flying about at the beginning, both girls have a need for a true friend, and ultimately find that in each other (albeit reluctantly on Kanae's part and too willingly on Kyoko's part). After their tag-team effort in winning an audition for a commercial, the two become best friends. Kyoko likes to call her \\"Moko\\". Despite some differences in their personality, both girls recognize that they are in fact very similar, most notably their desperate determination to reach the top of the show-biz pyramid. Both coming from a poor family, they strive endlessly to achieve their dreams. This, they recognize in each other, thus leading them to become friends. They are both incredible actresses with a great deal of respect for each other's talents. Kanae desperately wanted to be a star and was at the same audition as Kyoko, but although she did better than Kyoko, she also failed. She became the second member of Love Me, and has used that to her advantage. Kanae puts up a strong front, but is very self- conscious and is prone to self doubt. It is later revealed that Kotonami has problem dealing with kids, stemming from the fact that she comes from a large family with an obscenely large amount of younger nieces, nephews, and siblings. Although her attitude towards Kyoko may seem aloof at times, it is clear that she values their friendship, as she reluctantly shares her secret with Kyoko when she fears her unwillingness to share her troubles might drive Kyoko away. She figure outs that Ren is in love with Kyoko and tries to top things that will gain Kyoko's affection against Ren. Recently she has invited Kyoko over her house to make valentine's day chocolate for Hio. Hio helped her get away from a musician she detests, so she made chocolates for him. It seems that she has a soft spot for Hio as she has given him warm smiles from time to time. She and Chiori hit it off right away and also become really good friends. ; : (anime), King Chin (live-action) : He is Ren's manager. When first seen he is a serious character, later on he is used largely for comic relief. We get a better understanding of Ren’s subtle emotional shifts from Yashiro’s not-so-subtle reactions to Ren’s interactions with Kyoko. He fully supports a romantic relationship between the two and often needles Ren about his lack of progress in that area. To that goal, he sets up various situations where the two can be alone. (Act. 66 He tells Kyoko to go to Ren's place to make dinner for him.) And tells Kyoko of Ren’s feelings for her (Act. 57, during the acting test when Kyoko got stuck. Kyoko was lost in thought and didn't hear him.) He must use latex gloves when handling any electronics because any electronic device that he touches directly will soon be rendered broken and useless. In particular, he has mentioned that a cell phone will die after about 10 seconds of direct exposure to his skin. (On at least one occasion, Yashiro attempted to coerce Ren into telling him Kyoko's secrets by holding Ren's own cell phone captive with his bare hand.) Kyoko has theorized that Yashiro naturally transmits strong electric waves. He seems to be an extremely dedicated manager, as he has much, if not all, of Ren's schedule planned out about one year in advance (Kyoko learns this when she briefly took over for him as Ren's manager when he was too ill to work). In an extra strip in volume 11, it is revealed that the main reason Ren has never been late to a job, despite the crowds of fans that appear nearly everywhere he goes and clearly wish to mob him, is that Yashiro can stop even the most fervid fans in their tracks with a mere cold glance. He doesn't know how to drive, which is why Ren is always seen doing the driving. The guilt of having Ren drive is the reason why he does not enforce a more balanced diet when the two are traveling between locations and allows Ren to choose what they eat. ; : (anime), Allen Chao (live-action) :Lory is the extravagantly flamboyant president of L.M.E. He is one of the first people to recognize Kyoko's potential of being a great star, and created the \\"Love Me\\" section because of this. He seems genuinely concerned for Kyoko and wonders what could have happened in her past to cause her to lose the ability to love. He learns in Vol. 4 that Kyoko has never known her father and has a bad relationship with her mother, but does not know the details. Later, when he learned that she dropped out of school he arranges for her to attend a high school that specializes in accommodating students working in show business and their hectic schedules. Lory has a very deep voice, and often has a huge entourage with him to create the world's most striking and sometimes strangest entrances. He also has a granddaughter, Maria, who idolizes Kyoko. He also knows that Ren is really Kuon Hizuri, a secret everyone else doesn't know about except for himself, Ren, and Ren's family. In Act. 77 Access to the Blue, it is shown that President Takarada realizes that Ren is in love with Kyoko. He has a son, Maria's father, named Kouki, who is the polar opposite of him. They are similar in their work ethics, however. Lory loves Valentine's day so much he calls it \\"his spring\\". It was his idea to give 'Cain Heel' (Ren) a 'talisman' (Setsuka/Kyoko). ; : (visual novel) : Reino is the lead singer in his band, Vie Ghoul. When he first met Kyoko, he snorts at her and states that she is plain. He was sent by his company to copy Shō Fuwa and take all his fans. Reino seems to have special powers to see ghost and apparitions and becomes intrigued with Kyoko when he catches one of her mini demons. Reino continually stalked Kyoko for a period of time, claiming that she will be his. He argued with both Shō and Ren because of Kyoko. Kyoko also seems to misunderstand Vie Ghoul's name referring to them as the \\"Beagles\\". Reino returns in chapter 138 for Valentine's Day expecting Kyoko to give him chocolates as a gesture of her love to him. It is also hinted in that same chapter that he is in love with Kyoko (he tells her that valentine's day is the day men receive chocolate from the women they are in love with, which is why he is expecting chocolates from her). Reino also claimed that Ren is tired of Kyoko running to him for help. He once held one of Kyoko's \\"apparitions\\" as hostage, affectionately calling it \\"pet\\". By using a special bracelet, he can make it visible to everyone, including Kyoko. He later returned it to her after he got the Valentines Day chocolates. Due to his spiritual powers, he was able to see Ren's past as Kuon and because of this he is afraid of Ren and wants nothing to do with him as he says that he (Ren) is a dangerous person. ; : (anime), Frances (live-action) :Maria is the granddaughter of the president of L.M.E. and used to use her cute appearance to get people's sympathy. She did so before Kyoko's audition; however Kyoko recognized this, and called her out on it. While some people would be angry at Kyoko, Maria began to idolize her, and views her as an ultimate big sister. Maria also suffered from a huge guilt complex from her believing that she is the cause of her mother's death. When she was five years old, Maria called her mom to come see her because she wanted to celebrate her birthday with her mother, since she (and her father) rarely bothered to before. Unfortunately, the plane that her mother took to return crashed, killing her. As a result, Maria was unable to talk or even be around her father, since she thought that he hated her. It didn't help that her father worked far away and never came to see her and that he voiced out loud to Lory at the funeral how he wished that Maria didn't call her mother. He tried reaching out to her in his own way, but it wasn't enough. Kyoko managed to make Maria understand that her father didn't hate her now, or think that Maria caused her mother's death. Maria also loves to dabble with black magic (alongside Kyoko) and has a large crush on Ren Tsuruga. Comically in the Christmas Special chapter, Kyoko's present for Maria was a 1/2-scale doll of Ren with different expressions (this shocking everyone else on how detailed she was). ; :He is Ren's father and Julie's husband. He currently lives in America. He is also known by his former stage name, . He acted as Katsuki in the original series of Dark Moon which coincidentally is the role Ren plays 20 years later. Kyoko is assigned to take care of him as a Love Me member. At first glance, Hizuri's character appears to be harsh but it is later revealed to be an act to get Kyoko to complain to Ren so that Ren will see him. Hizuri's goal is to get Ren to make a video of him as his \\"alter-ego\\", so to speak. Hizuri takes an instant liking to Kyoko and gives her very helpful acting advice. When Kyoko wanted to decline the roles that were \\"Mio\\" type roles because she didn't want to stick to just one role, Hizuri was the one who stopped her from doing so. He challenged her to do the role of his son \\"Kuon\\", giving a great number of adjectives to describe him (when Kyoko asked for only one). Kyoko's portrayal the role of \\"Kuon\\" stunned Hizuri and his son Ren. Kyoko grew closer to Hizuri in the time she spent \\"taking care\\" of him. Hizuri \\"adopts\\" her as his own child when she tells him her wish to continue being his \\"student\\". Kyoko shouted \\"Father\\" when Hizuri was departing to America and Hizuri embraced her and called her \\"Kuon\\". He received an appreciative glance from Ren which surprised him. His manner seems very similar to Ren's character. ; :Voiced by: Chris Patton (english) (anime) :He is the director of the Dark Moon drama. He was in the shadow of his father and believed that all his works were like copies of his father's work. His father is a famous director, who directed the original Tsukimori. Ogata was using Dark Moon to get rid of his father's shadow. Both Ren and Kyoko help him to accomplish this. He knows that both Ren and Sho are in love with Kyoko and wonders who Kyoko will choose. ; :Also known as Kyoko's demons. These vengeful ghosts were always with her, however they were kept at bay by her extreme love and devotion to Shō. When Shō's true impression of her came to light, so did these apparitions. The demons often scare everyone around her, which Kyoko uses to her benefit. They also help keep Kyoko's drive going, as she sometimes questions her motives for stardom. Most of the time, the demons are held back by Kyoko's remaining pure feelings whenever the \\"pure Kyoko\\" feels that the anger is getting out of line. The demons give Kyoko a dark aura that is frightening to passersby. She has also used them as kanashibari to trap Kanae Kotonami. Kyoko has also used them as projectiles to hit people. Whenever someone or something is emitting very negative emotions, Kyoko's demons would emerge to enjoy the hatred in the air. This behavior helps her identify when Ren is using the fake smile to hide his anger. Reino held one of these demons hostage in order to force Kyoko to give him chocolates for Valentine's by threatening to adore it from the bottom of his heart if she refused, much to Kyoko and the demon's horror. (\\"I'll hug it and nuzzle it and sleep with it.\\") There were also angels who looked like Kyoko from beginning of the series, but they were ultimately defeated and banished by the demons, who looked like Kyoko with the makeover and new hair-style. ; :The third member of the LoveMe section. Unlike the first two members, Chiori volunteered herself to be placed in the department in order to rediscover the joy of acting. She thinks of Mogami Kyoko as an \\"Eternal Butterfly\\", the kind of actress that is able to immerse herself into any role she wishes to. Chiori has very little patience for people who do not earn their positions, and considers it an affront when someone (usually an actress) gains a role or popularity merely on the basis of their looks, especially when they have no talents to speak of. Chiori was once a child actress of amazing skill. However, a very dark role as Akari in \\"The Scarlet Dice,\\" combined with an on- set accident that left her scarred, typecasted her into very dark and scary roles as a young girl, which in turn made her into a depressive and internally violent character. Because of this, she left acting for a while, eventually returning to the business after shedding her childhood stage name, Tendou Akari, in an attempt to escape her dark past and the typecasting. Her first impression is one of extreme vitriol, and she's been known to scribble threats and excessive criticism of colleagues in her \\"poison notebooks\\". She initially hates Kyoko and actually attacks her by pushing her down the stairs once. As time passes, Chiori seems to be letting go of her bitterness from her childhood and maturing as she becomes a better actress. She respects Kyoko greatly and is good friends with her. Her and Kanae also get along very well and share similar points of views. This is surprising since Kanae originally decided not to have any friends. Lory gave her the task of taking part in a comedy show, which she found humiliating and tried to use the excuse of her manager's injury to avoid it. With the help of Kyoko, she changed her attitude and now earnestly goes on the stage to be a comical person. ; :An 11-year-old actor who appears much younger than his actual age. Kyoko at first believed he is the same age as Maria, who is in her second/third year of elementary school. He gets annoyed when people treat him as a child because he has been acting for nine years and comes from a long line of famous actors. At first, he is willing to use his family's influence in the entertaining world to destroy anyone who crossed him, such as targeting Kanae first and then Kyoko (the first for throwing him during a drama and the second for disrespecting him). His initial crush on Kanae has deepened and has gone so far as to protect her from a lecherous co-star since the man hates kids that appear to ride on their parents coattails. Hiou's grandfather runs a dojo and asks him to help train Kanae and Kyoko in fighting, which was needed for their auditions in an upcoming a drama set in feudal Japan. In addition, Hiou also asks his grandfather to be nice to Kanae which resulted in a huge difference in how he treats Kanae compared to Kyoko. Minor characters ; : (drama CD), Kenji Hamada (japanese); Keith Silverstein (English) (anime), Charge Pu (live- action) :He is head of the talent section at L.M.E. and was tormented by Kyoko into getting her into an audition. Despite the initial meeting, he is actually very supportive of Kyoko, even through her penchant for tripping her own idol career up. Sawara continually misinterprets Kyoko's hate for Shō as extreme fandom. He also has a wife and daughter. ; : Voiced by: Joe Zieja (English) (anime) : Head of the singing section in the L.M.E., he was present during Kyoko's audition and acted as one of the judges.

In the anime, he was the one who assigned Kyoko, as a member of the Love Me department, to become Ren's manager in Yashiro's stead, who could not perform his duties due to colds. ; :Voiced by: Karen Strassman (English) (anime) : Shoko Aki is Shō Fuwa's manager and implied lover. Before going to University, she has a passion for acting, but later realized that she is more capable of managing. She takes pride in her judgement and \\"knowing\\" Shō better than anyone else (except for Kyoko). Her relationship with Shō is rather flirtatious, but she encourages Shō's feelings towards Kyoko. Shoko misunderstands the LoveMe division in that she believes the members share love when really they are unable to love others. A running gag in the manga is that her well-meaning advice turns to devious ends once it is being misused or understood by Shōtaro. ; :Portrayed as a playboy, he has a noticeable interest in Kyoko since her makeover.

He was promoted to post-captain in March 1734, and appointed to , in which ship he was employed in the Channel and Mediterranean until September 1740, when he was transferred to the 60-gun . In this ship he continued for the next eighteen months, carrying out successful cruises against the enemy's privateers on the north coast of Spain, and on the coast of Portugal. He was then sent out to join the Mediterranean Fleet, and was present in the Battle of Toulon on 11 February 1744. Captain Ambrose was afterwards charged before a court-martial with having neglected his duty on that occasion; with firing and continuing to fire on the enemy whilst altogether out of range, with not having assisted when in extreme danger, with not having covered and protected the fire-ship when he might and should have done so, and finally with ‘disobedience to His Majesty's instructions and the signals and commands of the admiral, neglect of naval discipline, and being one of the principal causes of the miscarriage of His Majesty's fleet.’ The court held these charges to be proved in the principal part; but considering that he had always borne the character of a vigilant and diligent officer, and that his failure in the action was apparently due to a mistake in judgement, his judges sentenced him to be only cashiered during His Majesty's pleasure and to be fined one year's pay, to be given to the chest at Chatham. In 1748 he was restored to his rank and half-pay, and in April 1750 was advanced to be a rear-admiral on the retired list. He died on 26 March 1771.

Originally operated with a special dual-trigger mechanism (one to rotate the cylinder and cock the gun, a second to fire it) later models employed a single-trigger mechanism much the same as that found in the contemporary Beaumont–Adams revolver. Early Tranter revolvers were generally versions of the various Robert Adams-designed revolver models, of which Tranter had produced in excess of 8000 revolvers by 1853. The first model of his own design used the frame of an Adams-type revolver, with a modification in the mechanism which he had jointly developed with James Kerr. The first model was sold under the name Tranter-Adams-Kerr.  Design and operation  The Tranter revolver was a \\"solid-frame\\" design, very similar in appearance to the Beaumont–Adams revolver. Over the course of the 3 models Tranter developed, the only significant change was to the attachment of the ramrod- In the first model it was detachable, on the second model it was attached to the frame by a hook on the fixed barrel, and in the third model (1856) it was attached to the barrel by a screw. On the double-trigger Tranter revolvers, a second trigger below the trigger guard served to cock the gun. The hammer on this model had no spur and therefore could not be cocked with the thumb. To fire the weapon in the single-action mode, one had to first press the lower trigger, which would pull the hammer back and rotate the cylinder; at this point one could fire the gun with a light pull on the upper trigger. To fire more rapidly, one could pull both triggers simultaneously, making it a double-action weapon. History With the beginning of the American Civil War, the demands for foreign weapons in the Confederate States of America increased, as the Confederacy no longer had access to the weapons factories in the North and had almost no local small-arms manufacturing capability of their own. At the outbreak of the war, Tranter had a contract with the importing firm Hyde & Goodrich in New Orleans to import and distribute his revolvers commercially. Following the outbreak of the Civil War, Hyde and Goodrich dissolved their partnership, and its successors, Thomas, Griswold & Company, and A. B. Griswold & Company, continued to distribute Tranter's guns. As a reliable, functional, and proven design, Tranter revolvers soon enjoyed a great popularity among the Confederate military. The Tranter was originally produced in six calibres, with .36, .442, and .50 being the most popular, while Tranter developed an Army model (.44 calibre) and a Navy model (.36 calibre) for the American market. After the American Civil War, production continued of the Tranter percussion revolver (despite the increasing availability of cartridge- firing designs), because many people thought percussion firearms were safer and cheaper than the \\"new-fangled\\" cartridge-based designs of the time. In 1863, Tranter secured the patent for rimfire cartridges in England, and started production using the same frame as his existing models. As early as 1868, Tranter had also begun the manufacture of centrefire cartridge revolvers. By 1867, his company expanded its production with a new factory in Aston Cross, Birmingham, West Midlands under the name \\"The Tranter Gun and Pistol Factory\\". In 1878, he received a contract from the British Army for the supply of .450-calibre centrefire cartridge revolvers for use in the Zulu War. This was the last official use of Tranter revolvers by the British military. Tranter retired in 1885, with his patent rights -Between 1849 and 1888 Tranter secured 24 patents firearms design patents and 19 cartridge patents- as well as the Tranter factory later being acquired by munitions manufacturer George Kynoch. =Kynoch Gun Works= Kynoch renamed the factory \\"The Kynoch Gun Works\\" in 1885 and changed the address on its packaging from Birmingham to the more posh Aston. The factory's manager, Henry Schlund, held a patent in his own name for a revolver that was similar to the double-action six-cylinder Tranter revolver.British Patent No.9084 (July 28th, 1885) The revolver had a one-piece curved wooden grip, a shrouded hammer, a top-break cylinder with star-ejector, and a double trigger. (The first trigger, lying below the trigger guard and pulled with the middle finger, cocked the hammer and advanced the cylinder while the second trigger, which lay inside the trigger guard and was pulled by the ring finger, tripped the sear). Schlund patented and produced an improved version in 1886British Patent No.11900 (September 18th 1886) that had the cocking trigger inside the trigger guard. The Kynoch Model 1 was a large-framed revolver with a 6-inch barrel that came in .430 Tranter Short Centrefire, .450 Adams, .455/.476 Enfield Mk II, and .476 Enfield Mk II. It was designed for sale to Army officers. Some came with a detachable steel wire stock to convert it into a pistol carbine. The Kynoch Model 2 was a medium-framed revolver with a 5-inch barrel that came in .320 Tranter Centrefire Revolver, .360 Tranter Centrefire Revolver, .380 Tranter Centrefire Revolver, and .400 Tranter Centrefire. It was designed as a self- defense pistol. The Kynoch Model 3 was a small-framed revolver with a 3-inch barrel that came in .297/300 Tranter Centrefire and .300 Tranter Centrefire. It was designed as a \\"Saloon\\" pistol for indoors target practice or a \\"Rook and Rabbit\\" pistol for hunting vermin or small game. The boardmembers of Kynoch's company rebelled at his lack of focus and Kynoch was removed as chairman in 1888. The Gun Works was then sold to Schlund, who renamed the company Aston Arms Co. Ltd. and the brand name to the Schlund Revolver. The factory closed down in 1891. Only 600 Kynock revolvers of all versions and models were ever made. =Notable users= Famous users of Tranter revolvers included Allan Pinkerton, founder of the Pinkerton Detective Agency, the Confederate General James Ewell Brown Stuart, African adventurer Paul Du Chaillu, and Ben Hall, the Australian bushranger, and Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. It is also known that Dr Richard Jordan Gatling, inventor of the Gatling Gun owned an 80-bore (.38-calibre) First Model Tranter Pocket Revolver with a 4.29-inch [109mm] barrel retailed by Cogswell London in 1857. =Popular culture= A Tranter revolver was used by Lord John Clayton (played by Paul Geoffrey) in the 1984 feature film Greystoke: The Legend Of Tarzan. In the 1971 western Hannie Caulder, the lead character (played by Raquel Welch) carries the first model (dual-trigger version) of the Tranter. In the movie, however, the revolver is custom made from scratch for her by a gunsmith. The 1856 Tranter Revolver and the 1856 Tranter Revolving Rifle feature prominently in the 2016 Australian film The Legend of Ben Hall, as both weapons were historically favoured by bushrangers Ben Hall (bushranger) and John Gilbert (bushranger).

He founded the department of anthropology at Rutgers University in 1967 and had remained a professor there for the rest of his career, also being a director of research for the H. F. Guggenheim Foundation from 1972 to 1984. Fox published a work, The Imperial Animal, with Lionel Tiger in 1970, that was one of the earliest to advocate and demonstrate an evolutionary approach to the understanding of human social behaviour. His daughter Kate Fox wrote the international best-selling book Watching the English and his daughter Anne Fox is the founder and director of Galahad SMS Ltd. in the UK. In 2013 Fox was elected to the US National Academy of Sciences (Anthropology and Evolutionary Biology). Life and work Robin Fox was born in the village of Haworth in the Yorkshire Dales, at the nadir of the Great Depression in 1934. He had very little schooling during the Second World War, moving all over England with his soldier father (ex-Indian Army), and his mother, then an army nursing aide.See the dedication to Kinship and Marriage. After a narrow escape from death by bombing, he pursued his early education through the Army, the Church of England, public libraries, and the BBC, more than through formal schooling. Then through a series of scholarships—one of them to the grammar school in Thornton, West Yorkshire, he made his way to the London School of Economics in 1953 and gained a first degree in Sociology with First Class Honours. This included Philosophy and Social Anthropology, with much influence from Karl Popper, Ernest Gellner, and Raymond Firth—and occasional interaction with Bertrand Russell. He went to Harvard for graduate work in the Department of Social Relations where he found himself under the tutelage of Clyde Kluckhohn, Evon Vogt, Paul Friedrich and Dell Hymes, in New Mexico, where he studied language and society among the Pueblo Indians. He concentrated on the Pueblo of Cochiti, on the Rio Grande, on which he wrote his PhD thesis (submitted to the University of London and examined by Raymond Firth, Edmund Leach and Daryll Ford). A revised version of the thesis with his analysis of the evolution of Pueblo kinship systems and the \\"Crow-Omaha\\" question, was published as The Keresan Bridge: A Problem in Pueblo Ethnology, 1967. This logico-conjectural attempt to reconstruct the history of kinship terms was completely against the grain of Functionalist orthodoxy in England at the time, and equally critical of the prevailing American theories of acculturation. He returned to England, where he taught for four years in the department of sociology at the University of Exeter, starting fieldwork on Tory Island, a remote Gaelic-speaking community off the coast of County Donegal in Ireland (his mother's family, also called Fox, came from Ireland.) He wrote his first museum-series publication Kinship and Land Tenure on Tory Island (1966.) His work on the island eventually resulted in a book The Tory Islanders: A People of the Celtic Fringe (1978), for which the University of Ulster awarded him a doctor of science (D.Sc.) degree. He then returned to the LSE for four more years, lecturing mainly on kinship, and producing the widely used text translated into many languages, Kinship and Marriage: An Anthropological Perspective (1967): still in print. Fox had published what became a foundational paper \\"Sibling incest\\" in the British Journal of Sociology (1962), in which he again defied the overwhelming consensus of opinion, this time on the incest taboo, and revived the neglected theories of Edward Westermarck, coining the term \\"Westermarck Effect\\" (as opposed to the \\"Freud Effect\\"), now well known in the social sciences. Under the influence of such figures as John Bowlby, David Attenborough (who was his student for a while), Robert Ardrey, Niko Tinbergen, Desmond Morris, Michael Chance and Lionel Tiger, he became interested in ethology—the science of the evolution of behaviour. He gave the first primate behaviour and human evolution lectures in the department, co-teaching with the primatological anatomist John Napier from the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine. He and Tiger wrote a paper on \\"The Zoological Perspective in Social Science\\" (1966). This was one of the first salvos in the debate on nature/nurture issue that was to flare up in the sixties and seventies. He added to it with his Malinowski Memorial Lecture of 1967 on \\"Aspects of Hominid Behavioral Evolution.\\" During this time he saw three daughters into the world, Kate, Ellie and Anne.See the dedication to Encounter with Anthropology. Rutgers University offered him a chair of anthropology in 1967, and the chance to start a new department, including Tiger. This has grown to be a significant research department and graduate program. In 2009 its two-degree programs, evolutionary anthropology and cultural anthropology, were ranked in the top ten in the country. He and Tiger completed their joint work, The Imperial Animal, in 1970, a book that contributed to nature/nurture debate of the next few decades. He spent an academic year at Stanford University School of Medicine (Department of Psychiatry) as an NIMH fellow, studying behavioural biology and the brain with David Hamburg and Karl Pribram. In 1972, the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, through its president Mason Gross, ex-president of Rutgers, made Tiger and Fox joint Research Directors and started a program of support for work particularly on violence and dominance. The list of their grantees is a Who's Who in the early development of bio-social science and of what came to be known as sociobiology. They worked for twelve years with the Foundation, and during that time he did original research with Dieter Steklis among macaque monkeys on an island off Bermuda and vervet monkeys on St. Kitts. He produced several books including Encounter with Anthropology (1973) Biosocial Anthropology (editor and contributor, 1975), The Red Lamp of Incest (1980) and Neonate Cognition (1984, edited with Jacques Mehler of CNRS, Paris). During this same period he was a visiting professor at Oxford, Paris (Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales), the University of California, San Diego, and the Universidad de los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia, where he did a \\"participant observer\\" stint as a bullfighter, studying the provincial bullfight culture of southern Colombia. In 1985 Rutgers made him a University Professor, the highest honour it can give a faculty member. He wrote The Search for Society (1989) his \\"equal time response\\" to the interpretive anthropology of Clifford Geertz, and The Violent Imagination (1989), a book of essays, verse, satire, drama, and dialogue. Fox was then a Senior Overseas Scholar at St John's College, Cambridge, and wrote a series of related collections of his essays. The first was Reproduction and Succession (1993), relating his part in both the appeal of a Mormon policeman to the Supreme Court and the famous \\"Baby M\\" surrogate mother trials in New Jersey. Then followed The Challenge of Anthropology (1994), and Conjectures and Confrontations (1997). In 2000 he added significantly to the material in The Violent Imagination, plus a foreword by Ashley Montagu, which came out as The Passionate Mind. He has published a number of controversial papers on contemporary affairs in The National Interest – nationalism, the nature of war, the Northern Ireland problem, democracy in Iraq, the \\"end of history\\" – and a series of brisk exchanges on human rights, mostly with Francis Fukuyama and Amnesty International. He wrote an autobiography of the first forty years of his life as Participant Observer: Memoir of a Transatlantic Life (2004.) Since then Fox has written further books on the tribal basis of behavior, civilization and the savage mind, and the Shakespeare authorship question (Shakespeare's Education: Schools, Lawsuits and Theater in the Tudor Miracle (2012). In 2013 he was elected to the US National Academy of Sciences (Anthropology and Evolutionary Biology). In 2014 a festschrift for him was published by Transaction Publishers and edited by Michael Egan titled The Character of Human Institutions: Robin Fox and the Rise of Biosocial Science with seventeen contributions. He is married to Lin Fox (Ed.D. Columbia) who taught Health Sciences at Kean University, New Jersey; they live on a small farm outside Princeton, New Jersey. He continues to teach (American Indians, Origin and Fall of Civilizations, Comparative and Persistent Mythology, Incest in Literature) and to pursue research on the archaeology of the Calusa Indians of SW Florida, and the evolutionary relationship between consanguineous marriage and fertility.

The team, owned by John and Margaret Kelly, made its debut in 2009, and raced Holden VE Commodores until the end of the 2012 season. In 2013, the team switched to competing with Nissan Altimas, and was rebranded Nissan Motorsport. For 2020, They will run two Ford Mustang GTs. Following the Nissan sponsorship concluding, the team was rebranded back to Kelly Racing in 2019. The team is based in the Melbourne suburb of Braeside. In 2019 the team expanded into the new TCR Australia Touring Car Series, running another four cars, a pair each of Opel Astra TCRs branded as Holden Astras and Subaru WRX STI TCRs. The team's current drivers are Rick Kelly and Andre Heimgartner. Kelly Racing Former Nismo logo =Introduction= Despite some initial hurdles, the team was formed in 2009, after several months of preparation. The two sons of the owners, Rick and Todd were lead drivers for 2009, with sponsorship from Jack Daniel's. Jack Perkins and Dale Wood (though later replaced by Mark McNally), were confirmed as drivers of the third and fourth Kelly Racing entries. =Formation= After a troubled relationship with Tom Walkinshaw, with whom they formed the HSV Dealer Team, team principals John and Margaret Kelly took their two V8 Supercar Racing Entitlement Contracts (RECs) to set up Kelly Racing, forcing Walkinshaw to find other RECs to run his second team in the championship. With a decision by Holden to reduce support for most teams running their Commodore product in the series for 2009, along with the impending economic crisis, Larry Perkins chose to scale back his involvement in the sport through his Perkins Engineering team at the end of 2008. A deal was concluded that saw Perkins Engineering sell much of its hardware including cars to the new team, as well as provide engineering services with the functions gradually to be transferred to Kelly Racing. Many of the former Perkins Engineering transferred to Kelly Racing. Perkins also retained ownership of his RECs and was thus the entrant for the team's third and fourth cars. Racing numbers were swapped so that the Kelly owned licences could make use of the #7 racing number, to suit major sponsor Jack Daniel's and their \\"Old Number 7\\" brand. This sponsorship had been carried over from Perkins Engineering, where Todd Kelly was previously using the #7 racing number. =2009= The new team had its track debut at Winton Raceway on 3 March 2009, running the allowed 20-lap shakedown test for newly constructed cars in the V8 Supercar category, which was declared a success by both Todd and Rick. Following this initial shakedown, the team appeared at the official category test day at the same circuit on 9 March 2009, where all four cars appeared. The team's first race was the 2009 Clipsal 500. The two Kelly brothers finished in the top ten in the first race, Todd in 7th and Rick in 10th, after starting 24th and 17th respectively. Wood, who did not set a qualifying time after a crash in practice, finished 14th after starting from pitlane. Perkins failed to finish due to badly damaged steering caused by brushing the wall. Rick was the only one of the four drivers to finish the second race, again in 10th place. Todd Kelly and Jack Perkins both inflicted steering damage from contact with other cars while Dale Wood spun into the wall. The team left the weekend with Rick Kelly 8th in the championship standings, Todd Kelly in 16th, Dale Wood in 24th and Jack Perkins in 30th. Todd made the following comment on the team's first weekend: \\"Getting an event under our belt, we've now got pages and pages of things we need to address and improve on. This is our first race as a brand new team so given that, I think the weekend wasn't too bad.\\" Todd and Rick achieved numerous top ten results as the season went on, the best being Rick's 4th places at Winton and Hidden Valley, while Perkins and Wood struggled. Wood was replaced by Mark McNally from the Townsville round onwards. Todd and Rick teamed up in the #7 car for the endurances races at Phillip Island and Bathurst with Nathan Pretty and Ben Collins driving the #15 car. Dale Wood returned to the driving seat to partner Jack Perkins in the #11 car while Tony Ricciardello joined Mark McNally in the #16 car. The Kelly brothers finished fifth in the L&H; 500 after Todd won one of the qualifying races. Bet 24/7 came on board as major sponsor for the #11 car before Bathurst, with Perkins and Wood running #247 for the Bathurst weekend. Todd and Rick Kelly were running in second place with only a handful of laps to go in the Bathurst 1000, but a damaged rear wing and a late safety car led to the brothers finishing in eighth place. Perkins reverted to #11 for the remainder of the season. The team scored its first podium finish at the Island 300, which turned out to be the first in a hat-trick of podiums for the team, with Rick finishing third and second at Phillip Island and Todd finishing second in race one at Barbagallo. The final championship standings saw Rick Kelly finish in eighth, Todd Kelly in 18th, Jack Perkins in 26th, Dale Wood in 29th and Mark McNally in 30th. Jack Daniel's Racing (#7 and #15) finished sixth in teams' championship with Kelly Racing (#11 and #16) in 13th and last of the two car teams. =2010= In 2010 Jason Bargwanna and Tony Ricciardello joined the team. Rick took the team's first pole position at Winton but did not manage a win. Only one podium result came out of 2010, Rick finishing third in the rain-affected first race of the Sydney 500. For the endurance races, Rick and Todd were not allowed to pair up due to new regulations regarding endurance co-drivers. Owen Kelly, of no relation to the two brothers, joined Rick in the #15 car while Dale Wood drove with Todd. Ricciardello was partnered by Taz Douglas while two-time Australian touring car champion Glenn Seton partnered Bargwanna. Rick and Owen had a strong run at the Phillip Island 500, finishing fourth after needing to conserve fuel at the end of the race, while the other three cars all finished outside the top fifteen. The team had a disappointing Bathurst, with none of the cars finishing in the top ten, the best result 16th place for Rick and Owen. The team hired Scott Dixon and Alex Tagliani as its international drivers for the Gold Coast 600, Dixon driving with Todd Kelly and Tagliani with Bargwanna. Owen Kelly remained with Rick and Wood moved into the #16 car with Ricciardello. It proved to be another average weekend, with Rick and Owen again providing the best result, a sixth place in race two. The final championship standings saw Rick and Todd repeat their 2009 efforts, finishing eighth and 18th respectively. Bargwanna ended up 24th and Ricciardello was 26th. Jack Daniel's Racing was fifth in the teams' championship and Kelly Racing was 11th. =2011= The Jack Daniel's Racing drivers remained the same for 2011, but two new drivers were hired for Kelly Racing, Greg Murphy and David Reynolds. 2011 was the team's most successful season to date. Rick Kelly scored the team's first race win in wet conditions at the Hamilton 400. Todd made it an extra special day by finishing in third place despite having a broken windscreen wiper. Rick won a further two races, with a win in Darwin at Hidden Valley and a win at Sandown later in the season, placing 6th in the championship. Todd for a third year straight placed 18th in the series, Reynolds impressed on his return to V8 Supercars, with numerous top ten qualifying efforts and two top five race results, eventually placing 19th. Murphy placed a respectable 13th in the Pepsi Max Holden. For the endurance races, the team signed David Russell, Allan Simonsen, Owen Kelly and Tim Blanchard to drive with the team, with Russell joining Todd in Car #7, Simonsen joining Murphy in car #11, Owen Kelly joining Rick in #15 and Blanchard pairing up with Reynolds in #16. For the Gold Coast 600, the team signed Richard Westbrook to drive with Todd, Oliver Gavin to drive with Murphy, Jörg Bergmeister to drive with Rick and Alex Tagliani to join Reynolds. At Phillip Island, all cars finished in the top 15, with car #16 the best in 6th. At Bathurst, a fifth car was entered, the #77 Shannons-Mars Racing Commodore, with Grant Denyer and Cameron Waters driving the car. Car #11 claimed Pole position, with #16 qualifying in 4th, the Jack Daniels cars qualified in 16th and 19th, car #77 qualified 29th and Last. Murphy and Simonsen eventually finished 11 seconds behind the winners in 3rd position, with car #16 finishing in 19th, Car #15 placing 22nd and Car #7 placing 24th, some 7 laps down on Murphy and Simonsen, the fifth car of Denyer and Waters did not finish. =2012= 2012 started with the announcement that they would switch to Nissan for 2013 making them the first team to change manufacturers for the new regulations. Rebirth as Nissan Motorsport2013= In January 2013 the RECs of Larry Perkins were purchased for the third and fourth entries.\\"Larry Perkins Confirms Sale of RECs to Kelly Racing\\" Speedcafe 24 January 2013 For 2013 the team was rebranded as Nissan Motorsport. Michael Caruso and James Moffat were recruited to drive the third and fourth entries. =2014= All four drivers continued with the team in 2014. After the 2014 Season, Norton ended their title sponsorship of the Moffat and Caruso entries. =2015= For 2015, the Norton inspired race numbers, #36 and #360, were replaced, with Caruso changing to Nissan's traditional #23 (a wordplay on the marque itself, \\"ni\\" meaning two and \\"san\\" meaning three) and Moffat to #99. Jack Daniels also downsized their sponsorship to just the #15 car of Rick Kelly, with Carsales replacing Jack Daniels on the #7 car of Todd Kelly. =2016= Moffat left the team at the end of 2015 with Dale Wood returning to the team.\\"Nissan Motorsport signs Dale Wood for 2016 V8 Supercar Championship\\" Nissan Motorsport 16 November 2015 Caruso won a race for the team at Hidden Valley. The Team also ran a fifth entry in the Bathurst 1000, with Renee Gracie and Simona de Silvestro driving the #360 Harvey Norman Supergirls Altima. The entry placed 14th. =2017= In 2017, Dale Wood was be replaced by Simona de Silvestro. Todd Kelly, Rick Kelly and Michael Caruso remained with the team. =2018= For 2018, Todd Kelly retired and was replaced by Andre Heimgartner.

Other common names include banana-tail ray, drab stingray, fantail ray, feathertail stingray, and frill tailed sting ray. This species is sometimes placed in the genus Dasyatis or Hypolophus (an obsolete synonym of Pastinachus). The most distinctive characteristic of the cowtail stingray is the large, flag-like ventral fold on its tail, which is especially prominent when the ray is swimming. This species is targeted by commercial fisheries as a source of high-quality shagreen, a type of leather, and its populations are now under threat from heavy exploitation. Distribution and habitat The cowtail stingray has a widespread distribution in the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific, from South Africa and the Red Sea to Japan and Australia, including Melanesia and Micronesia. They are amphidromous and known to enter estuaries and rivers. This species is the most commonly reported stingray from fresh water in Southeast Asia, and there is a record from the Ganges River some from the sea. They are usually found on sandy bottoms in coastal waters and on coral reefs to a depth of . Description Swimming cowtail stingray, showing ventral tail fold. The pectoral fin disk of the cowtail stingray is very thick, with almost straight anterior margins and rounded apices, and measuring 1.1-1.3 times as long as wide. The snout is broadly rounded and blunt. The eyes are very small and widely spaced. The mouth is narrow, with 20 rows of distinctive hexagonal, high-crowned teeth in each jaw and five papillae on the mouth floor. The tail is broad-based, with a filamentous tip and a single venomous spine located well backwards of the pelvic fins. There is no upper tail fold; the high ventral tail fold measures 2-3 times the height of the tail but does not reach the tip. The disk surface is covered by a broad band of fine dermal denticles extending from near the tip of the snout to the upper surface of the tail, excluding the extreme margins of the disk. Newborns are entirely smooth but develop denticles quickly after birth. Juveniles have four circular tubercles at the center of the disk, which often become indistinct in adults. The coloration is a uniform grayish brown to black above and mostly white below. The tail fold and tip are black. This species may reach long and across, and in weight. Biology and ecology Cowtail stingray on a sand flat. Cowtail stingrays are solitary foragers that feed on bony fishes (including leiognathids, Nemipterus, and soles), crustaceans, polychaete worms, sipunculids, and molluscs. The cowtail stingray is in turn preyed upon by various species of hammerhead and requiem sharks, as well as by the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus). When threatened, they consistently flee at a 45° angle away from the predator, a trajectory that allows them to maximize the distance covered while still keeping the predator within their field of vision. Like other stingrays, reproduction in this species is ovoviviparous, with the embryos sustained in late development by histotroph (\\"uterine milk\\") delivered via specialized structures. The females giving birth to live young measuring across or more. Single young individuals have been reported year-round in the Strait of Malacca; juveniles have more pointed snouts than adults. Adults are sometimes accompanied by remoras or trevallies. Known parasites of the cowtail stingray include Dendromonocotyle ardea, Decacotyle tetrakordyle, and Pterobdella amara. Observations of cowtail stingrays in Shark Bay, Australia, show that this species enters shallow, sandy flats during high tide to rest for a minimum of four hours. They often form small groups when resting, particularly when visibility is poor such as in turbid water or under low light conditions. The typical size of such groups is three individuals (larger groups, up to nine, are rare), arranged in a \\"rosette\\" formation with their tails pointing outward. This appears to be an anti-predator behavior, as the close circular arrangement of the rays allows them to see predators approaching from any direction. The rosette also orients their less critical tails, containing mechanoreceptors that comprise a secondary warning system, towards potential threats. The members of the group will flee in concert, reducing a predator's ability to target any one individual. Cowtail stingrays also preferentially form mixed-species groups with reticulate whiprays (Himantura uarnak), likely because the whiprays are better able to detect predators due to their longer tails. An antique round box covered with galuchat. Relationship to humans The serrated spine of the cowtail stingray is potentially dangerous, and this species is regarded as particularly dangerous to handle as its long tail is capable of reaching over its back to strike someone gripping it from the front. Small to moderate numbers of cowtail stingrays are caught as bycatch in trawls and marketed for meat throughout their range, and their tough skin is used to polish wood. This species is also the primary source of shagreen or galuchat, a type of leather, for which it has been valued since ancient times due to the large size and regular arrangement of its dorsal tubercles (called \\"pearls\\" in the trade from their nacreous appearance after being rubbed down, hence the old name \\"pearled ray\\"). A boom in the international shagreen trade since the 1990s, with the material being used in many fashion accessories from wallets to fancy pens, has led to enormous numbers of cowtail stingrays being harvested in Southeast Asia. As stingrays are slow-reproducing, long-lived animals, there are fears that this unregulated exploitation is unsustainable and will lead to a population collapse.

The primary significance of the island is its use for nesting by large numbers of colonial waterbirds such as egrets and night herons.An effort to protect shoreline habitats for wildlife, Suzzanne Dechillo, New York Times, August 23, 1987 In addition to the heron and cormorant populations, Huckleberry Island has significant nesting colonies of herring gull and great black-backed gull. In 1987, an estimated 1000 nesting herring gulls and 400 nesting great black- backed gulls were observed here. The great egrets and snowy egrets tend to nest in the tops of densely crowned trees. Black-crowned night herons appear to nest in the lower extent of the forest canopy and double-crested cormorants nest in either the upper branches of small trees along the forest edge or at the tops of the larger trees. Most of the gulls nested near the edge of the rocks along the island's perimeter (mostly at the north end). Other possible nesting birds include green heron and little blue heron. This island is listed in the National Audubon Society 2002 Open Space Conservation Plan as a priority site under the project name Westchester Marine Corridor. Cormorant droppings have been killing many trees at this site, making them unsuitable for nesting by herons and egrets. There is some concern that the non-native Norway maple understory may eventually replace the native hardwood trees.

Bells Are Ringing, a Broadway musical, was based on her career, which was turned into the 1960 film of the same name. Biography Born Mary Selina Horn in Grosse Pointe, Michigan on April 8, 1923, she was raised in Hampton, Virginia and became afflicted with polio as a five-year-old. She moved to New York City after dropping out of college and a failed marriage. There she married cocktail pianist Bob Printz in 1953 and found a night job at an answering service to match her husband's evening schedule. =Bells Are Ringing= The service she worked for was used by many of the city's professionals and people in show business, and Printz was noted for her ability to serve her clients, going beyond just listening to her customers to the point where she would pick up their laundry, walk their dog or water their plants, whatever was necessary. Adolph Green, one of her clients, based the Broadway musical play Bells Are Ringing on Printz's situation, with book and lyrics by himself and Betty Comden and music by Jule Styne. In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson described Judy Holliday's character Ella Peterson as \\"an original subject - a telephone answering service that leads into the personal lives of several people. This is how the dream girl played by Miss Holliday meets her sweetheart, and brings a number of other bizarre people together\\". The original production ran from 1956 to 1959, with songs such as The Party's Over and Just in Time that have become standards. Both Holliday and co-star Sydney Chaplin won Tony Awards for their performances. The play was made into a 1960 film version directed by Vincente Minnelli, starring Judy Holliday, who reprised her stage role, and Dean Martin. =Belles Celebrity Answering Service= Printz established the Belles Celebrity Answering Service in 1956, the same year the Broadway play opened, getting up at 4 a.m. in order to be able to arrive at the switchboard to make wake up calls that started as early as 5 a.m. There, Printz provided her customers with services that went beyond messages. Starting with Hermione Gingold, who was on the calling end of Printz's first message, her clients included Candice Bergen, Shirley MacLaine, Robert Redford, Burt Reynolds, Brooke Shields, Liz Smith, Spencer Tracy, Kathleen Turner, Tennessee Williams, as well as members of the rock band Kiss. She once received a call from Noël Coward who was panicked after draining the last out of a bottle of Scotch on Sunday when liquor stores were closed. Printz had her husband pick up a bottle from a cooperative bartender and had him deliver it to Coward at his building, solving yet one more crisis. By the late 1960s, the company had 300 business and theatrical customers, but was running into problems with phone company service on the Plaza 8 exchange it used that served the area around East 50th Street in Manhattan. A spike in demand for telephone calls resulted in the PLaza 8 exchange being out of service for periods of time around June 1969. A client who called the phone company to complain about her inability to contact \\"the Belles\\" was told to contract with an alternate service \\"not on PL 8\\".Smith, Gene. \\"Phone Users Dial FRustration, Too; Telephone Users Are Dialing FRustration, Too\\", The New York Times, July 6, 1969. Accessed March 4, 2009. The firm had as many as 600 clients at its peak by the late 1970s, with over 20 operators at six switchboards. Celebrities and the well-off were the company's mainstay, all of whom came by referral, as the company did not advertise. Leonard Bernstein called to use the company's service, saying \\"This is Lenny. Adolph asked me to call you\\". Printz would not take business from physicians or repairmen, saying \\"It's too much trouble for the girls\\". Though the advent of the answering machine cut into her business, Printz remained at the company until her death, by which time the service still had about 90 customers, including Woody Allen, Stephen Sondheim and Steven Spielberg. The Belles service continues (without the \\"Celebrity\\" in its name and considerably modernized), currently run by Roger Snyder, who bought the business in 2009. =Death= Printz died at age 85 on February 21, 2009 at her home in Tappan, New York due to congestive heart failure, which was related to post-polio syndrome. She was survived by her husband, two sons and a granddaughter.

A pupil of Charles Marie Widor, in 1900 he made his debut as organist in Lyon at the Church of the Good Shepherd (Église du Bon-Pasteur). Four years later he spent six months at the Church of Saint Polycarpe (Église Saint-Polycarpe), which owns one of the loveliest organs in the city. He took up his post at Lyon Cathedral in 1904 and was a professor at the Conservatoire de Lyon. Among his students were Pierre-Octave Ferroud and Adrien Rougier. Called \\"the best French organist\\" by the well- known music critic Émile Vuillermoz, Commette earned similar tributes from his students and listeners from all parts of the world and is responsible for some of the earliest organ recordings. \\"These – 78s, of course – were intended for a local market: their world-wide success amazed the modest M.

Like model checkers, such as SPIN, ISP verifies the complete state space of a system for a set of safety properties. However, unlike model checkers, ISP performs code level verification. This means that the tool verifies all relevant interleavings of a concurrent program by replaying the actual program code without building verification models. This idea was pioneered in a number of tools, notably by Godefroid, in his VeriSoft tool.Patrice Godefroid, Model Checking for Programming Languages using VeriSoft POPL 1997 Other recent tools of this genre include the Java Pathfinder, Microsoft's CHESS tool, and MODIST.

TVNZ reported in 2007 that over 20 wave and tidal power projects are currently under development. However, not a lot of public information is available about these projects. The Aotearoa Wave and Tidal Energy Association was established in 2006 to \\"promote the uptake of marine energy in New Zealand\\". According to their 10 February 2008 newsletter, they have 59 members. However, the association doesn't list its members.Aotearoa Wave and Tidal Energy Association From 2008 to 2011, the government Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority is allocating $2 million each year from a Marine Energy Deployment Fund, set up to encourage the utilisation of this resource.Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority - Marine Energy The greater Cook Strait and Kaipara Harbour seem to offer the most promising sites for using underwater turbines. Two resource consents have been granted for pilot projects in Cook Strait itself and in the Tory Channel, and consent is being sought for a project sites at the entrance to the Kaipara. Other potential locations include the Manukau and Hokianga Harbours, and French Pass. The harbours produce currents up to 6 knots with tidal flows up to 100,000 cubic metres a second. These tidal volumes are 12 times greater than the flows in the largest New Zealand rivers. Tidal power Tidal power is generated by capturing some of the energy in the tides as they cycle forth and back, twice each day. Tidal devices can be weir or dam like structures (barrages), used to hold the tide back, or turbines anchored within the tidal stream. By world standards, New Zealand's tides are, for the most part, moderate. The tide usually ranges between one and two metres. Tidal currents are usually around two kilometres per hour (one knot). Some exception are in and around Cook Strait, where tidal currents can be much stronger, and at the entrance to some harbours, particularly Kaipara Harbour.Stevens, Craig and Chiswell, Stephen. Ocean currents and tides: Tides Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 21 September 2007 Headlands and constrictions like these focus the currents, giving energy levels reaching 750 W per square metre.Stevens, Craig; Smith, Murray and Gorman, Richard (2005) Ocean bounty: energy from waves and tides Water & Atmosphere, Vol.13, No.4. =Tides= Tides are controlled mainly by the gravitational pull of the moon. About once a day the moon rotates about the earth, attracting as it travels the bulge of water called the high tide that also travels round the earth. There are actually two high tides, because the earth and moon, as a system, both rotate about a common centre of mass. This centre is two-thirds out from the centre of the earth, not at the centre of the earth. The effect of the earth spinning about this centre is that it behaves as a centrifuge, resulting in a second high tide bulge in the ocean most distant from the moon. A second influence on the tides occurs because of gravitation from the sun. Gravitation from the sun has less influence than the moon, because it is so much further from earth. However, the sun influences the tidal range. When the sun, earth and moon are aligned in a straight line (at new and full moon), their tidal effects combine, producing the particularly high and low tides called spring tides. When the sun is at right angles to the moon, the effects are partially cancelled, producing the small tides called neap tides. New Zealand has a relatively small tidal range, usually less than two metres. However, some of the larger harbours on the west coast of the North Island, in particular the Kaipara, experience significant currents as the tides rise and fall. Altogether there are sixty-two recognised natural influences on the tides, though only some will be significant at a given location. The gravitation of the moon and sun are the most important. A third influence occurs because the moon orbits at an angle to the equator. This means that if one of the bulges travelling around the earth is above the equator, then the other bulge is below the equator. It also follows that some places will have one daily diurnal tide, while other places will have semi-diurnal tides twice a day. For example, there is a diurnal tide in the Ross Sea near Antarctica every 24.84 hours. The height of this tide dwindles to almost zero in a cycle which takes 13.66 days. New Zealand's tides are semi-diurnal. The primary cause, the lunar tide, is labelled the M2. The M stands for the moon and the 2 stands for twice a day. A fourth influence occurs because the orbit of the moon around the earth and the orbit of the earth around the sun are elliptical rather than circular. The effect of this is that the time between high tides changes a little from day to day. The moon takes about 24.8 hours to orbit around the earth, so it takes half this time, 12.4 hours, for the M2 tides to occur. The tides can be predicted far in advance, because the moon and earth have orbits that are predictable. The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) run a tidal computer model specific to New Zealand.Tide Forecaster (New Zealand) – NIWA The actual tide pattern and timing is determined by the nature of the resonances in each ocean basin with the various frequencies of the gravitational influences, over many cycles. New Zealand's situation (like Iceland's) is a small island in a large basin, and the peaks and troughs of the M2 tides sweep continuously anticlockwise around New Zealand. When it is high tide on the west coast, it is low tide on the east coast, and vice versa: the straightforward notion of tidal bulges aligned with the moon is insufficient. These currents are most noticeable in straits such as Cook Strait and in Foveaux Strait.Marine Energy: Summary of Current Developments and Outlook for New Zealand Prepared for the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority, 18 May 2005 A notable example is French Pass, just off the greater Cook Strait, where, despite the low tidal range, tidal streams can reach nearly eight knots. =Manapouri= Oddly enough, since the construction of the Manapouri power station, there has been about five MW of tide- determined generation. The tailrace tunnel exit by Dusky Sound debouches at sea level, and thus the effective head of the power station is affected by the level of the tide there. If the turbines are operated at a fixed flow aperture, the power produced is not constant but follows the tide, an effect that can be seen in the following graph. Note that the timing follows the tides around the clock, not the usual twenty-four cycle of electricity usage. Generation and Tide Height. The Opunake power station has its tailrace exiting to the beach but its operation is intermittent so if there is any tidal effect on generation there, it is unclear. =Cook Strait= Cook Strait has tidal flows amongst the strongest in the world, even though it has a smaller tidal range than most places in New Zealand. This is because the main M2 lunar tide component which circulates anti-clockwise around New Zealand is out of phase at each end of the strait. On the Pacific Ocean side the high tide occurs five hours before it occurs at the Tasman Sea side. On one side is high tide and on the other is low tide. The difference in sea level can drive tidal currents up to 2.5 metres per second (5 knots) across Cook Strait as well as into the Tory Channel.Benign tides Energy NZ No.6, Spring 2008. Contrafed Publishing. An unusual complication is that although there are two spring tides a month on the north side, the south side has only one spring tide a month, as shown in the plot alt=Graph showing 6 lines with two lines for each of three cities. Nelson has two monthly spring tides, while Napier and Wellington each have one. A further consequence of these opposed tides is that there is almost zero tidal height change at the centre of the strait. Although the tidal surge should flow in one direction for six hours and then the reverse direction for six hours, a particular surge might last eight or ten hours with the reverse surge enfeebled. In especially boisterous weather conditions the reverse surge can be negated, and the flow can remain in the same direction through three surge periods and longer. This is indicated on marine charts for the region.Chart of Cook Strait There are numerous computer model representations of the tidal flow through Cook Strait. While the tidal components are readily realizable,Lunar tides in Cook Strait, New Zealand the residual flow is more difficult to model.Bowman, M.J., A.C. Kibblewhite, R. Murtagh, S.M. Chiswell and B.G. Sanderson (1983) Circulation and mixing in greater Cook Strait, New Zealand. Oceanologica Acta 6(4): 383-391 In April 2008, a resource consent was granted to Neptune Power for the installation of an experimental underwater tidal stream turbine in the strait. The turbine has been designed in Britain and will be built in New Zealand at a cost $10 million. Fourteen metres in diameter and constructed of carbon fibre, it will be capable of producing one megawatt. It will be placed in eighty metres of water, 4.5 kilometres due south of Sinclair Head, in waters known as the “Karori rip”. Power from the turbine will be brought ashore at Vector's Island Bay substation. The turbine is a pilot, and will be sited in slower tides for testing. Neptune hopes to generate power from the unit by 2010. The company claims there is enough tidal movement in Cook Strait to generate 12 GW of power, more than one-and-a-half times New Zealand's current requirements.Renewable energy development: Tidal Energy: Cook Strait Harnessing the power of the sea Energy NZ, Vol 1, No 1, Winter 2007 In practice, only some of this energy could be harnessed.http://www.radionz.co.nz/audio/national/ngts/2009/02/19/salty_water On the other side of the strait, Energy Pacifica has talked for some time about applying for resource consent to install up to ten marine turbines, each able to produce up to 1.2 MW, near the Cook Strait entrance to Tory Channel. They claim Tory Channel has tidal flows of 3.6 metres per second with good bathymetry and access to the electricity network. No application had been lodged by March 2011. The power generated by tidal marine turbines varies as the cube of the tidal speed. Because the tidal speed doubles, eight times more tidal power can be produced at spring tides than at neap tides. =Kaipara Harbour= The entrance to Kaipara Harbour, one of the largest harbours in the world, is a channel to the Tasman Sea. It narrows to a width of ,Haggit T, Mead S, and Bellingham M (2008) Kaipara Harbour Environmental Information Review ARC Technical Publication TP 354. and is over deep in parts. On average, Kaipara tides rise and fall . At high tide, nearly 1000 square kilometres are flooded. Spring tidal flows reach 9 km/h (5 knots) in the entrance channel and move 1,990 million cubic metres per tidal movement or 7,960 million cubic meters daily.Bellve, AR; Austin, G and Woods, B (2007) Pathway to energy generation from marine tidal currents in New Zealand's Kaipara Harbour University of Auckland. In 2011, Crest Energy, a power company, received resource consent to install about 200 underwater tidal turbines for the Kaipara Tidal Power Station, which would use the substantial tidal flows moving in and out every day near the harbour mouth to produce electricity for approximately 250,000 homes. Crest plans to place the turbines at least 30 metres deep along a ten kilometre stretch of the main channel. Historical charts show this stretch of the channel has changed little over 150 years. The output of the turbines will cycle twice daily with the predictable rise and fall of the tide. Each turbine will have a maximum output of 1.2 MW, and is expected to generate 0.75 MW averaged over time.FAQ Crest Energy The peak level of generation for the combined turbines is about 200 MW. This exceeds the projected peak electricity needs of Northland. It would have environmental benefits in offsetting annual carbon emissions from a thermal- based, gas turbine generator of 575,000 tonnes of carbon. The project is costed at about $600 million and to be economic would have to be scaled up rapidly to near full capacity.Harnessing the power of the sea Energy NZ, Vol 1, No 1, Winter 2007. However, while the Department of Conservation has approved the project, and has made substantial environmental monitoring conditions part of the consent, the project also has objectors on the grounds of claimed influences on the local ecosystems and charter fishing. Appeals before the Environment Court were concluded in 2010, with a favourable decision released in February 2011. Wave power Wave power involves converting the energy in ocean surface waves into electricity using devices either fixed to the shore, the seabed or floating out at sea. Wave energy varies with time, depending on when and where the winds and storms that drive the waves occur. Tidal energy is more regular and predictable. Two wind zones affect New Zealand. South-east trade winds dominate in the north, enlivened an occasional cyclone from the tropics. The rest of the country is dominated by the roaring forties, a broad band of westerly winds that span the middle latitudes of the southern hemisphere. The roaring forties extend over most of the southern part of the Tasman Sea and the Southern Ocean. These winds produce some of the stormiest seas in the world, with maximum wave heights regularly exceed 4 metres.Stevens, Craig and Chiswell, Stephen. Ocean currents and tides: Waves Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 21 September 2007 On average, ocean waves in New Zealand deliver about 25 kW to each metre of coastline. The west and south-west coasts have the country’s most energetic waves. Even on windless days, swells that were generated in the Southern Ocean still arrive. Less wave energy arrives at the north-east coast, because it is sheltered from the south-west waves (click the link on the right for a diagram). The amount of energy in a wave is proportional to the square of its height, so a two-metre wave contains four times the energy of a one-metre wave. Wave Energy Technology - New Zealand (WET-NZ) is a Government-funded research and development collaboration programme between Industrial Research Limited, a Crown Research Institute, and Power Projects Limited, a privately owned Wellington-based company. The programme seeks to develop a wave energy device that generates electricity from both the kinetic and potential energy available in open ocean waves. In 2010 WET-NZ received resource consent for half-scale prototype testing at two test sites.Implementing Agreement on Ocean Energy Systems October 2010 Bulletin The device is now called Azura and is being tested in Hawaii.

His nicknames were \\"Big Dom\\", \\"Large\\", and \\"the Hat.\\" Chicago Outfit career In the late 1940s, Cortina famously purchased a cigarette tax stamp machine and reported it stolen. Before it surfaced, millions of dollars in bogus tax stamps had been run off for the mob. In 1963, Cortina was among associates of the Chicago Outfit named at a United States Senate hearing. In 1970, Cortina was convicted of federal gambling charges for operating a gambling business across state lines. He was sentenced to three years in prison. The convictions of Cortina and four other alleged gangsters, including that of Jackie Cerone, were touted as a milestone in the FBI's effort to smash coast-to-coast betting rackets on sports. In 1982, an Illinois legislative investigating committee linked a bingo parlor on Chicago's Northwest Side to Cortina and another reputed syndicate gambling figure, William McGuire. By the mid-1980s, Cortina was operating a highly successful sports betting empire along with Chicago Outfit member Donald Angelini.United States v. Cortina, 733 F. Supp. 1195 (21 March 1990, Eastern Division of the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois) In 1987, Cortina and Angelini were sent by Chicago Outfit head Joseph Ferriola to assume caretaker roles in Nevada, in the wake of the murder of Anthony Spilotro, who had overseen Chicago Outfit interests there. On June 22, 1989, Cortina was arrested at his home and charged with conspiring with six others to engage in loan sharking, robbery, insurance fraud, gambling and the illegal import of cars into this country from Europe. The indictment, which was unsealed in Miami, Florida, alleged that Cortina and others had conspired since 1982 to steal and defraud, using a North Miami Beach, Florida pawn shop as a cover for their activities. Cortina, who also had maintained a home in Naples, Florida, was accused in the indictment of racketeering conspiracy, plotting a home invasion in which an expensive diamond ring was taken, running a bookmaking operation and cheating the government out of payment of tens of thousands of dollars in customs duties on so-called \\"grey market\\" cars imported from West Germany. On November 8, 1989, Cortina, Angelini and an associate, Joseph Spadavecchio, were charged with running a multimillion-dollar sports betting ring between 1982 and 1988. Cortina was alleged to have supervised offices on Chicago's West Side and in its west suburbs that were used to take bets on professional and college football, basketball and baseball games. Cortina, Angelini and Spadavecchio all pleaded guilty to running the sports betting ring. Federal investigators presented evidence showing that the gambling ring operated in 16 locations in Chicago, Oak Park, Illinois and Bensenville, Illinois and took in $127,309,188 during that period. On March 21, 1990, United States District Judge Nicholas John Bua sentenced Cortina and Angelini each to 21 months in prison and ordered each one to pay the $1,210 monthly cost of his imprisonment. Spadavecchio was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison, fined $50,000 and also ordered to pay the cost of his imprisonment. Bua rejected prosecutors' request for sentences of approximately twice those lengths, noting that no federal court anywhere in the U.S. had sentenced individuals convicted of similar crimes to sentences of the length that prosecutors were requesting. Cortina was released from federal prison in 1992, and later returned to federal prison after being convicted of other charges. He was released from federal prison for good on April 6, 1995.http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&needingMoreList;=false&FirstName;=Dominic&Middle;=&LastName;=Cortina&Race;=U&Sex;=U&Age;=&x;=0&y;=0 Cortina never was associated with the violent faction of organized crime. In fact, he and Angelini were known for not strong-arming clients but instead for treating them politely. In some cases, prosecutors said, the duo even suggested that their clients give up gambling for their own well-being. Personal life In August 1988, Cortina moved into a one-story home on Windsor Drive in Oak Brook, Illinois. The house backed up to a hotel parking lot, and investigators speculate that Cortina preferred the location because the location would make it more difficult for investigators to learn who was coming to see him. Cortina sold that house in 1994 for $710,000 and moved into a condominium unit nearby. Cortina died on November 19, 1999 of cancer in a Chicago-area hospice. Cortina was survived by his wife, Jody; two daughters, Pam Cortina and Vicki Annecca; a son, Michael; and five grandchildren Michelle Cortina, Joseph Cortina, Christine Cortina, and Dominic.

Plantinga's argument is a defense against the logical problem of evil as formulated by the philosopher J. L. Mackie beginning in 1955. Mackie's formulation of the logical problem of evil argued that three attributes of God, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence, in orthodox Christian theism are logically incompatible with the existence of evil. In 1982, Mackie conceded that Plantinga's defense successfully refuted his argument in The Miracle of Theism, though he did not claim that the problem of evil had been put to rest.  Mackie's logical argument from evil  The logical argument from evil argued by J. L. Mackie, and to which the free-will defense responds, is an argument against the existence of the Christian God based on the idea that a logical contradiction exists between four theological tenets in orthodox Christian theology. Specifically, the argument from evil asserts that the following set of propositions are, by themselves, logically inconsistent or contradictory: # God is omniscient (all-knowing) # God is omnipotent (all- powerful) # God is omnibenevolent (morally perfect) # There is evil in the world Most orthodox Christian theologians agree with these four propositions. The logical argument from evil asserts that a God with the attributes (1–3), must know about all evil, would be capable of preventing it, and as morally perfect would be motivated to do so. The argument from evil concludes that the existence of the orthodox Christian God is, therefore, incompatible with the existence of evil and can be logically ruled out.  Plantinga's free-will defense  Plantinga's free-will defense begins by asserting that Mackie's argument failed to establish an explicit logical contradiction between God and the existence of evil. In other words Plantinga shows that (1–4) are not on their own contradictory, and that any contradiction must originate from an atheologian's implicit unstated assumptions, assumptions representing premises not stated in the argument itself. With an explicit contradiction ruled out, an atheologian must add premises to the argument for it to succeed. Nonetheless, if Plantinga had offered no further argument then an atheologian's intuitive impressions that a contradiction must exist would have remained unanswered. Plantinga sought to resolve this by offering two further points. First, Plantinga pointed out that God, though omnipotent, could not be expected to do literally anything. God could not, for example, create square circles, act contrary to his nature, or, more relevantly, create beings with free will that would never choose evil. Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible offsetting justification that God could have as a morally justified reason for permitting the existence of evil. Plantinga did not claim to have shown that the conclusion of the logical problem is wrong, nor did he assert that God's reason for allowing evil is, in fact, to preserve free will. Instead, his argument sought only to show that the logical problem of evil was invalid. Plantinga's defense has received strong support among Christian academic philosophers and theologians.: \\"It used to be widely held by philosophers that God and evil are incompatible. Not any longer. Alvin Plantinga's Free Will Defense is largely responsible for this shift.\\": \\"Most philosophers have agreed that the free will defense has defeated the logical problem of evil. ... Because of [Plantinga's argument], it is now widely accepted that the logical problem of evil has been sufficiently rebutted.\\" Contemporary atheologians have presented arguments claiming to have found the additional premises needed to create an explicitly contradictory theistic set by adding to the propositions 1–4. These arguments have not yet gained wider academic philosophical support. In addition to Plantinga's free-will defense, there are other arguments purporting to undermine or disprove the logical argument from evil. Plantinga's free-will defense is the best known of these responses at least in part because of his thoroughness in describing and addressing the relevant questions and issues in God, Freedom, and Evil.  Further details  As opposed to a theodicy (a justification for God's actions), Plantinga puts forth a defense, offering a new proposition that is intended to demonstrate that it is logically possible for an omnibenevolent, omnipotent and omniscient God to create a world that contains moral evil. Significantly, Plantinga does not need to assert that his new proposition is true, merely that it is logically valid. In this way Plantinga's approach differs from that of a traditional theodicy, which would strive to show not just that the new propositions are valid, but that the argument is sound, prima facie plausible, or that there are good grounds for making it. Thus the burden of proof on Plantinga is lessened, and yet his approach may still serve as a defense against the claim by Mackie that the simultaneous existence of evil and an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God is \\"positively irrational\\". As Plantinga summarized his defense: > A world containing creatures who are significantly free (and freely perform > more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a > world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free > creatures, but He can't cause or determine them to do only what is right. > For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do > not do what is right freely. To create creatures capable of moral good, > therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give > these creatures the freedom to perform evil and at the same time prevent > them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free > creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is > the source of moral evil. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, > however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; > for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing > the possibility of moral good. Plantinga's argument is that even though God is omnipotent, it is possible that it was not in his power to create a world containing moral good but no moral evil; therefore, there is no logical inconsistency involved when God, although wholly good, creates a world of free creatures who choose to do evil. The argument relies on the following propositions: # There are possible worlds that even an omnipotent being can not actualize. # A world with morally free creatures producing only moral good is such a world. Plantinga refers to the first statement as \\"Leibniz's lapse\\" as the opposite was assumed by Leibniz. The second proposition is more contentious. Plantinga rejects the compatibilist notion of freedom whereby God could directly cause agents to only do good without sacrificing their freedom. Although it would contradict a creature's freedom if God were to cause, or in Plantinga's terms strongly actualize, a world where creatures only do good, an omniscient God would still know the circumstances under which creatures would go wrong. Thus, God could avoid creating such circumstances, thereby weakly actualizing a world with only moral good. Plantinga's crucial argument is that this possibility may not be available to God because all possible morally free creatures suffer from \\"transworld depravity\\".  Reception  According to Chad Meister, professor of philosophy at Bethel College, most philosophers accept Plantinga's free- will defense and thus see the logical problem of evil as having been sufficiently rebutted. Robert Adams says that \\"it is fair to say that Plantinga has solved this problem. That is, he has argued convincingly for the consistency of God and evil.\\" William Alston has said that \\"Plantinga ... has established the possibility that God could not actualize a world containing free creatures that always do the right thing.\\" William L. Rowe has written \\"granted incompatibilism, there is a fairly compelling argument for the view that the existence of evil is logically consistent with the existence of the theistic God\\", referring to Plantinga's argument. In Arguing About Gods, Graham Oppy offers a dissent, acknowledging that \\"[m]any philosophers seem to suppose that [Plantinga's free-will defense] utterly demolishes the kinds of 'logical' arguments from evil developed by Mackie\\" but continuing \\"I am not sure this is a correct assessment of the current state of play\\". Concurring with Oppy, A. M. Weisberger writes \\"contrary to popular theistic opinion, the logical form of the argument is still alive and beating.\\" Among contemporary philosophers, most discussion on the problem of evil presently revolves around the evidential problem of evil, namely that the existence of God is unlikely, rather than illogical.  Additional objections and responses  Incompatibilist view of free will = A simplified taxonomy of the main positions on the nature of free will Critics of Plantinga's argument, such as the philosopher Antony Flew, have responded that it presupposes a libertarian, incompatibilist view of free will (free will and determinism are metaphysically incompatible), while their view is a compatibilist view of free will (free will and determinism, whether physical or divine, are metaphysically compatible). The view of compatibilists is that God could have created a world containing moral good but no moral evil. In such a world people could have chosen to only perform good deeds, even though all their choices were predestined. Plantinga dismisses compatibilism, stating \\"this objection ... seems utterly implausible. One might as well claim that being in jail doesn't really limit one's freedom on the grounds that if one were not in jail, he'd be free to come and go as he pleased\\". = Transworld depravity = Plantinga's idea of weakly actualizing a world can be viewed as having God actualizing a subset of the world, letting the free choices of creatures complete the world. Therefore, it is certainly possible that a person completes the world by only making morally good choices; that is, there exist possible worlds where a person freely chooses to do no moral evil. However, it may be the case that for each such world, there is some morally significant choice that this person would do differently if these circumstances were to occur in the actual world. In other words, each such possible world contains a world segment, meaning everything about that world up to the point where the person must make that critical choice, such that if that segment was part of the actual world, the person would instead go wrong in completing that world. Formally, transworld depravity is defined as follows: Less formally: Consider all possible (not actual) worlds in which someone always chooses the right. In all those, there will be a subpart of the world that says that person was free to choose a certain right or wrong action, but does not say whether they chose it. If that subpart were actual (in the real world), then they would choose the wrong. Plantinga responds that \\"What is important about the idea of transworld depravity is that if a person suffers from it, then it wasn't within God's power to actualize any world in which that person is significantly free but does no wrong – that is, a world in which he produces moral good but no moral evil\\" and that it is logically possible that every person suffers from transworld depravity. = Leibniz' lapse = Plantinga writes in God, Freedom, and Evil that J. L. Mackie has presented the objection that God, being omnipotent and omnibenevolent, would easily be able to create the best of all possible worlds. He reasons that such a world would be one in which all humans use their free will only for good – something they do not do. Hence, the free-will defense fails. Plantinga responds by pointing out two flaws in Mackie's reasoning, which, together, he names Leibniz' Lapse, owing to their reliance upon the misunderstandings of the German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The first is the presumption that God can force humans to use their free will only for goodwhich is an inherent contradiction, because if this were so, their actions would no longer be free. The second that Plantinga labels is the very idea that there is a \\"best\\" of all possible worldshowever good the world is, there could always be at least one more good person inside it, so the idea of a \\"best\\" is incoherent. = Molinism = The focus on possible worlds in Plantinga's free will defense unwittingly reinvented the Molinist doctrine of middle knowledge—knowledge of the counterfactuals of human freedom, thereby precipitating a revival in the interest of Molinism. Parts of Luis de Molina's Concordia were translated into English for the first time. Molinism was applied not only to the problem of evil, but also to the incarnation, providence, prayer, Heaven and Hell, perseverance in grace and so on.

Lord John Stuart and his Brother, Lord Bernard Stuart, c. 1638, by Sir Anthony van Dyck, National Gallery, London LordLord being a courtesy title for a younger son of a duke George Stewart (or Stuart), 9th Seigneur d'Aubigny (17 July 1618 – 23 October 1642) was an Anglo-ScottishHis mother was English and the family had returned from France in 1579 with little connection to their Scottish ancestry nobleman of French descent and a third cousin of King Charles I of England.Both were descended in the male line from John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox He supported that king during the Civil War as a Royalist commander and was killed aged 24 at the Battle of Edgehill in 1642. Origins He was the 3rd son of Esmé Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox (1579-1624), Seigneur d'Aubigny, by his wife Katherine Clifton, 2nd Baroness Clifton (c.1592-1637). His eldest brother was James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond, 4th Duke of Lennox (1612-1655) of Cobham Hall in Kent. Youth in France His father died of spotted fever when George was aged 6 and he became a ward of his cousin King Charles I of England. He was brought up (with his elder brother Henry and younger brother Ludovic) at the Château d'Aubigny in the parish of Aubigny-sur-Nère in the ancient province of Berry in France, as a Roman Catholic, under the charge of his paternal grandmother, Katherine de Balsac (d.1631/2), Dowager Duchess of Lennox,Cust 1891, pp. 100-105. widow of Esmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox, 1st Earl of Lennox (1542-1583). Esmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox was the favourite of the young King James I & VI (and a first cousin of that king's father Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley), who in 1579 had returned to Scotland from his French origins at Aubigny and was showered with honours by the young Scottish king, from 1603 also King of England. The Château d'Aubigny and the lordship of that manor (Seigneurie d'Aubigny) was first acquired by his distant relative Sir John Stewart of Darnley, 1st Comte d'Évreux (c.1380-1429), a Scottish nobleman and famous military commander who served as Constable of the Scottish Army in France, supporting the French against the English during the Hundred Years War, and a fourth cousinBoth were descended from Alexander Stewart, 4th High Steward of Scotland (d.1283) of King James I of Scotland (reigned 1406 to 1437), the third monarch of the House of Stewart. Career In 1632 at the age of 14 he inherited the Seigneurie d'Aubigny (lordship of the manor of Aubigny-sur-Nère), following the death of his 17 year-old elder brother Henry Stewart (1616-1632), who died in Venice.Gaspard Thaumas de la Thaumassiere, Histoire de Berry, Paris, 1689, pp.697-702 By 1633 he was a student at the Collège de Navarre, part of the University of Paris. He did homage to Louis XIII of France for the lordship of Aubigny on 5 August 1636, shortly after his eighteenth birthday. Later that year he moved to England. He fought with the French against the Spanish in the Battle of Montjuïc (1641). As civil war loomed in England, Stewart joined the forces of King Charles at York where he was knighted on 18 April 1642 along with his brother Bernard. Death, burial & succession He was mortally wounded during the first engagement of the Battle of Edgehill on Sunday 23 October 1642, aged 24. Also killed later during the Civil War fighting for the Royalist cause were his two younger brothers Lord John Stewart (1621-1644) and Lord Bernard Stewart (1623-1645),Manganiello 2004, p. 518. the famous Van Dyck double-portrait of whom - the iconic image of Cavaliers - survives in the National Gallery, London. George was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. The lordship of Aubigny passed to his next brother Ludovic Stewart (d.1665). Marriage and children In 1638, at the age of 20 and secretly, he married Katherine Howard (d.1650), a daughter of Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk, without her father's consent, thus offending his guardian the king. The surviving portrait of George Stewart by Anthony van Dyck, now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, may have been painted to mark his marriage; the Latin inscription Me Firmior Amor (\\"love is stronger than me\\") may allude to his conflicting loyalties. His wife survived him and remarried to James Levingston, 1st Earl of Newburgh, and following the defeat of the Royalists both were suspected in 1648 of plotting to rescue the exiled King Charles I and on the discovery of the supposed plot fled to the Netherlands where Katherine died in 1650. By Newburgh she had one further child, Elizabeth Levingston. By his wife George Stewart had two children: *Charles Stewart, 3rd Duke of Richmond, 6th Duke of Lennox (1638–1672), of Cobham Hall in Kent and of Richmond House in London, last in the male line of the Stewarts of Aubigny, who was the heir of his infant first cousin Esmé Stuart, 2nd Duke of Richmond, 5th Duke of Lennox (1649-1660), the son and heir of James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond, 4th Duke of Lennox (1612-1655), of Cobham Hall in Kent. After his death in 1672, childless but having married three times, the titles of Richmond and Lennox (which had merged into the crown respectively in 1485 (on the accession of Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond as King Henry VII of England), and in 1586 on the accession of King James I & VI as King of Scotland (being the heir of his paternal grandfather Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox (d.1571)) became available for re-grant by King Charles II, and the French territorial title of Aubigny was also vacant. The Stewarts of Aubigny had been much beloved by the Stuart monarchs and Charles II conferred their titles on his last mistress Louise de Kérouaille and his illegitimate son by her Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, 1st Duke of Lennox (1672-1723). At the request of the English king, the French king created Louise Duchesse d'Aubigny in the peerage of France, which title was inherited at her death by her grandson Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, 2nd Duke of Lennox, 2nd Duc d'Aubigny (1701-1750). The titles are still held today by his descendant, seated at Goodwood House in Sussex. * Katherine Stewart (1640–1702), of Cobham Hall in Kent, heiress of her childless brother, who later inherited via her paternal grandmother the title Baroness Clifton of Leighton Bromswold; the dukedoms passed to male heirs only. she married firstly Henry O'Brien, Lord Ibrackan, and secondly Sir Joseph Williamson.

Hosted by Zoran Kesić, the programme blended classic talk show elements such as show-business guests promoting their activity and musical performances with sketch comedy that included characters developed and played by Kesić. Its guests were drawn from the public sphere in Serbia and the rest of the Balkans. The show's name translates to \\"Closing time Republic\\" and it premiered on Sunday, 21 December 2008 at 11pm. It has since then been moved (in late January 2009) to Thursdays at 9pm, and then back to Sundays at 11pm in early November 2009. Starting in fall 2012, a year after getting cancelled, a live version of the show, this time named Fajront Republika 3D, had been performed with bi-weekly frequency at a Belgrade theater. History After the quickly canceled Marko Živić Show and Oralno doba, Fajront Republika was Fox televizija's third attempt in less than 2 years to come up with a long term locally produced entertainment talk-show programme. Unlike its previous two tries that aired nightly, Fajront Republika was broadcast weekly, probably due to specific editing requirements. Shot on a set that resembles a kafana with a bar and a stage, the programme was also geared towards a younger audience much more so than a fore mentioned shows. The host, Zoran Kesić, was somewhat already known due to his earlier television shows Dezinformator and Klub zatvorenog tipa that aired locally in Belgrade on local station TV Metropolis, while Fajront Republika became his first shot on the national Serbia-wide television. In addition to Kesić, some of the hosting duties were handled by sidekicks Igor Bugarski and Aleksandar Todorović Bekan. Another important member of the team was Balša Bošković who handled the editing. Fajront Republika quickly managed to build an audience due to the host's irreverent style and jovial personality. Additionally, it gained a sizable following on Facebook as well as through Kesić's side promotional activities such as making a literal music video from Madonna's \\"Like a Prayer\\" and posting it on YouTube in November 2009 — the video quickly went viral, reaching 1 million views in less than a month before being taken down due to copyright infringement issues. Towards the end of the second season in May 2010, the show created a bit of a stir in Serbian media by announcing that it is going off the air,Zoran Kesić napušta Foks?!;Vesti On Line, 22 April 2010 and airing the farewell episode. This was followed by the network's official announcement that it's just changing hosts and original host's outraged reaction at this turn of events.Kesić: Bruka šta mi je Foks uradio!;Press, 15 May 2010 For a single episode the show was in fact hosted by Žarko Stepanov. Eventually, it was revealed the whole thing was a media stunt created by Kesić and he returned as host for the following episode.Zoran Kesić: Sve je bilo zezanje!;mondo.rs, 1 September 2011 Fajront Republika's ratings reportedly deteriorated during the third season after the May 2010 launch and quick success of Veče sa Ivanom Ivanovićem, another entertainment weekly talk show on Prva's schedule.

It is the type species of Scutellinia, as well as being the most common and widespread. The fruiting bodies are small red cups with distinct long, dark hairs or \\"eyelashes\\". These eyelashes are the most distinctive feature and are easily visible with a magnifying glass. The species is common in North America and Europe, and has been recorded on every continent. S. scutellata is found on rotting wood and in other damp habitats, typically growing in small groups, sometimes forming clusters. It is sometimes described as inedible, but its small size means it is not suitable for culinary use. Despite this, it is popular among mushroom hunters due to its unusual \\"eyelash\\" hairs, making it memorable and easy to identify.  Taxonomy  S. scutellata was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in his book Species Plantarum as Peziza scutellata, and it was given its current name by Jean Baptiste Émil Lambotte in Memoires societe royale des sciences de Liege in 1887. It was also named Patella scutellata in 1902. The specific name scutellata is from the Latin for \\"like a small shield\\". Common names include the eyelash fungus, the eyelash cup, the scarlet elf cap, the Molly eye-winker and the eyelash pixie cup. The genus Scutellinia is currently placed in the family Pyronemataceae. However, genera of the Pyronemataceae lack unifying macroscopic or microscopic characteristics; this lack of uniting characters has led various authors to propose a variety of classification schemes. A 1996 study of British specimens of Scutellinia revealed that the species S. crinita, originally described as Peziza crinita in 1789 by French botanist Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard, was synonymous with S. scutellata.  Description  The fruiting body of S. scutellata is a shallow disc shape, typically between in diameter. The youngest specimens are almost entirely spherical; the cups open up and expand to a disc during maturity. The inner surface of the cup (the fertile spore-bearing surface, known as the hymenium) is bright orange-red, while the outer surface (the sterile surface) is pale brown. The flesh is red and thin. The outer surface is covered in dark coloured, stiff hairs, measuring up to in length. At the base, these hairs are up to thick, and they taper towards the pointed apices. The hairs form distinctive \\"eyelashes\\" on the margin of the cup that are visible to the naked eye. or easily visible through a magnifying glass. S. scutellata is sessile-- it does not have a stalk. = Microscopic features = Asci and ascospores of S. scutellata, drawn by Johann Hedwig in 1788. S. scutellata has asci of approximately 300 µm by 25 µm in size, and releases elliptical spores measuring 18 to 19 µm by 10 to 12 µm. The translucent (hyaline) ascospores have a rough exterior, (with very small warts) and contain small droplets of oil. They are white when present in large numbers, like a spore print. The paraphyses are cylindrical in shape and feature septa partitioning the hypha into distinct cells. Electron microscopy of the top of the ascus has revealed a roughly delimited operculum (a flap-like covering of the ascus) and ascostome (a pore in the apex of the ascus), and a subapical ring.  Edibility  While some list S. scutellata as inedible, others list it as having an unknown edibility. David Arora considers it too small to be of any culinary interest, and it lacks a distinctive smell or taste.  Distribution and habitat  Scutellinia scutellata typically grows in groups on rotten wood. S. scutellata is common in both Europe, where it can be found from late spring to late autumn, and North America, where it fruits in winter and spring. It has also been collected in Cameroon, Colombia, East Asia, India, Iceland, Israel, New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, Russia, and Turkey. A saprobic species, it grows generally in subalpine regions, fruiting on rotten wood and damp soil, and can also sometimes be found on ashes, wet leaves or bracket fungi. In Alaska it has been found growing on humus in the tundra. A six-year study of the succession of fungal flora appearing on freshly cut stumps of Poplar trees (Populus canadensis) showed that S. scutellata appeared roughly in the middle of the fungal succession (about 2-4 years after the tree had been cut), along with the species Ascocoryne sarcoides, Scutellinia cervorum, and Lasiosphaeria spermoides. When growing on wood, it is often obscured by surrounding moss. Though sometimes found alone, they typically fruit in groups, sometimes forming dense clusters on rotting wood or other plant detritus. Due to its small size, it is often overlooked, but mycologist Vera Evenson has observed that \\"the discovery of the Eyelash Cup is always a great pleasure\\", due to \\"the beauty of the eyelashes\\". Vera McKnight describes it as \\"a most attractive little fungus\\", and claims it is easy to notice due to its bright colouration.  Carotenoids  The carotenoids are pigmented molecules found naturally in plants, and some types of fungi, including S. scutellata. A 1965 study reported the carotenoid composition of this fungus, found to contain a high proportion of monocyclic carotenes—carotenes with only one cyclohexene ring, such as beta-carotene. Also present were minor amounts of xanthophyll, a molecule structurally related to the carotenes.  Similar species  Of more than a dozen species of Scutellinia, S. scutellata is the most common and widespread, though a microscope is required to differentiate between some of them. It is also the type species of the genus. It is differentiated from most other Scutellinia by its larger size, and its distinctive \\"eyelashes\\". Although David Arora describes S. scutellata as \\"easily recognizable\\", it can be mistaken for S. umbrarum (which has a larger fruiting body and larger spores, as well as having shorter, less obvious hairs) S. erinaceus (which is slightly smaller, and orange to yellow in colour, with smooth spores), Cheilymenia crucipila (which is much smaller, with short, pale hairs and spores lacking oil droplets) and Melastiza chateri, which is bright orange with small brown hairs. The \\"Pennsylvania eyelash cup\\" (S. pennsylvanica) is a smaller North American version that has smaller hairs and spores that are more coarsely warted than S. scutellata. S. barlae is very similar as well, and can only be reliably distinguished by its roughly spherical ascospores that are typically 17–23 µm in diameter. Species from the genus Lamprospora are smaller and hairless. Similar fungi that favour dung over rotting wood include Cheilymenia coprinaria, C. theleboides, and Coprobia granulata while species such as Anthracobia macrocystis, Anthracobia melaloma, Trichophaea abundans, Pyronema omphalodes, Pulvinula carbonaria and Pulvinula archeri are cup fungi that favour burned-over ground.

The lens is produced in Canon EF mount, Four Thirds System, Nikon F-mount, Pentax K mount, the SA mount, and the Sony/Minolta AF Mount varieties, all have the same optical formula. The lens is designed for digital crop DSLR with an APS-C sized sensor. Because of this, if the lens is used on a non-crop body, such as a Nikon D700, it will cause significant mechanical vignetting. When used on a body with a field of view compensation factor of 2× (Four Thirds body) it provides a field of view equivalent to a 36–100mm lens mounted in a 35mm body. In a 1.6× body, such as the Canon EOS 450D, it provides a less narrow field of view, equivalent to a 29–80mm lens mounted on a 35mm frame body. With a 1.5× body such as the Nikon D300, it provides a less narrow field of view, equivalent to a 27–75mm lens mounted on a 35mm frame body. Technical information The 18–50mm 2.8 EX DC Macro is a consumer-level lens. It is constructed with a plastic body and a metal mount. The lens features a distance window with depth of field scale. A 7-blade, maximum aperture of 2.8 gives the lens the ability to create depth of field effects. The optical construction of the lens contains 15 lens elements, including two aspherical lens elements, one SLD (Special Low Dispersion) element, and one ELD (Extraordinary Low Dispersion) element. The lens uses an internal focusing system, powered by a micro motor. Auto focus speed of this lens is moderate, but because of its focal length, auto focus time is not long. The front of the lens does not rotate, but the focusing ring does, when using auto focus. The lens uses an extending inner lens barrel when zooming; this allows a more compact design, and does not rotate while zooming.photozone.de = HSM variant = In 2007, Sigma released a HSM version of the 18–50mm 2.8 EX DC Macro, called the 18–50mm 2.8 EX DC Macro HSM. This lens is available for Nikon F-mount only. The lens has the same optical formula as the non-HSM lens, but is 0.5 mm shorter, and 85 g (18.9 oz.) heavier. The lens has a closer minimum focus distance of 20 cm, but because of the larger Nikon DX sensor size, the magnification rating is still 1:3. Also because of larger sensor size, the stated angle of view is 76.5°–31.7°, though these angles are still obtainable on the non-HSM version.

Historically, a house negro had a higher status and standard of living than a field slave or \\"field negro\\" who worked outdoors, often in harsh conditions. House negro is also used in the 2010s as a pejorative term to compare a contemporary black person to such a slave. History The term \\"house negro\\" appears in print by 1711. On May 21 of that year, The Boston News-Letter ran an advertisement that \\"A Young House-Negro Wench of 19 Years of Age that speaks English to be Sold.\\" In a 1771 letter, a Maryland slave- owner compared the lives of his slaves to those of \\"house negroes\\" and \\"plantation negroes\\", refuting an accusation that his slaves were poorly fed by saying they were fed as well as \\"plantation negroes\\", though not as well as the \\"house negroes\\". In 1807, a report of the African Institution of London described an incident in which an old woman was required to work in the field after she refused to throw salt-water and gunpowder on the wounds of other slaves who had been whipped. According to the report, she had previously enjoyed a favored status as a \\"house negro\\". Margaret Mitchell made use of the term to describe a slave named Pork in her famed 1936 Southern plantation fiction, Gone With the Wind. African-American activist Malcolm X commented on the cultural connotations and consequences of the term in his 1963 speech \\"Message to the Grass Roots\\", wherein he explained that during slavery there were two types of slaves: \\"house negroes\\" who worked in the master's house, and \\"field negroes\\" who performed outdoor manual labor. He characterized the house negro as having a better life than the field negro, and thus being unwilling to leave the plantation and potentially more likely to support existing power structures that favored whites over blacks. Malcolm X identified with the field negro. Contemporary use The term has been used to demean individuals, in critiques of attitudes within the African-American community, especially against politically right-leaning African-Americans, and as a borrowed term in contemporary social critique. In New Zealand in 2012, Hone Harawira, a Member of Parliament and leader of the socialist Mana Party, aroused controversy after referring to Maori MPs from the ruling New Zealand National Party as \\"little house niggers\\" during a heated debate on electricity privatisation, and its potential effect on Waitangi Tribunal claims. In June 2017, comedian Bill Maher used the term self-referentially during a live broadcast interview with US Senator Ben Sasse, saying \\"Work in the fields? Senator, I’m a house nigga [...]. It’s a joke!\\" Maher apologized for the comment. In April 2018, Wisconsin State Senator Lena Taylor used the term during a dispute with a bank teller. When the teller refused to cash a check for which there were insufficient funds, Taylor called the teller a \\"house nigger\\". Both Taylor and the teller are African Americans.

With ticket sales down, he needs some new way to sell his show. Meanwhile, on a trip to his psychoanalyst, he meets a beautiful girl, Mary, and falls in love with her. He soon finds out that this girl is the daughter of the politician, Randolph Sumner, who is trying to shut his theater down for lewd material. Billy then tries to win over both Mary and Randolph by posing as a political activist (assuming a different name) while making his dim- witted employee Boris pose as operator of the theater, Billy Minsky. The real Minsky, meanwhile, is torn between his newfound love for the politician's daughter and the loyalty he feels to the cast and crew of his theater. He claims that he has convinced Minsky (really his employee Boris) to clean up the show, and invites Sumner to come and see it. His real motive is to get a compromising photograph of Sumner under false pretenses to derail his political career. He is successful in this enterprise, but, in so doing, reveals his real identity and thereby alienates Sumner's daughter, Mary. =Act Two= Billy has thwarted his opponent, Sumner, but has also lost all hope of winning his daughter Mary. He has saved his theater, and all of its employees, but at the expense of his own happiness. He is given an unexpected second chance, however, when Mary returns to the theater under cover, seeking revenge. Billy sees through her disguise right away, but decides to play along with it in the hopes that they might be reconciled. Although Mary originally returns (with her father in drag) to destroy Billy and his theater, she finds herself more and more sympathetic to the people who make their living there, and in the end she finds it difficult to choose between her father's wishes and the livelihood of the Winter Garden Theater cast and crew.

It is located north of Uzhhorod near villages Nevytske and Kamianytsia, Uzhhorod Raion along the . The castle is located in woods on the hill of volcanic origin with relative elevation of and few hundred meters to the east of the road and river that flows along. Such location of the castle was giving a good opportunity to control Transcarpathian route over the Uzhok pass (Bieszczady Mountains). The castle was first mentioned in 1274 belonging to the King of Hungary Laszlo IV as a dungeon or a keep. Completely rebuilt in the early 15th century, it, towering over the Uzh River, was the mighty citadel of the Drugeth family which supervised its continuous modernisation over the centuries. The keep, rebuilt in its present form in the early 16th century, passed from hand to hand during the internecine strife that convulsed Hungary in the early 17th century. In 1644, Prince of Transylvania George II Rákóczi ruined the castle, leaving it much as it stands today. A decline in defensive importance of the site as well as the remote and inaccessible situation of the castle have preserved it from complete demolition. Near the site is located Uzhhorod Military Training Center.

It is about Reuben, who one day loses everything. The play follows a path similar to David Mamet's play Edmond. It traces a psychological journey through Reuben's head while he tries to figure out how everything happened. The play was written at a time when the story would hit home for a lot of middle-aged, middle-class men. Play SynopsisAct 1= The play opens with the lead character, Reuben, playing squash with Peter, a business partner. They get into an argument which causes Reuben to go to dinner by himself. At dinner an old friend named Paul comes into the restaurant and strikes up a conversation. Paul asks what Reuben would do if he lost everything, a question Reuben does not understand. Paul asks, “Do you have everything you need and do you need everything you have?” Reuben, who is still confused by the conversation, heads home. His wife, Donna, confronts him about love letters between him and another girl. He explains that they were from a long time ago, but she kicks him out of the house. Reuben then heads to a bar where he runs into another old friend, Mike, who tells him how he was just laid off. Reuben then recalls the conversation he had earlier with Paul, and mentions it to his friend at the bar who informs him that Paul had died in a plane crash a year ago heading to Vancouver. Reuben, shaken up by what Mike has told him, leaves the bar and goes to a pay phone to find Paul's home phone number. Sarah, Paul’s wife, answers and they reminisce about the how long it had been since they had seen each other. Reuben asks how she and Paul are doing and that is when she reveals that Paul had indeed died a year ago in a plane crash heading to Vancouver. The conversation ends there because Sarah is busy watching a movie with her kids. Reuben then receives a call almost immediately after he hangs up with Sarah from Peter telling him he needs to come to the office. When Reuben arrives he is confronted by Peter and two other colleagues, Frank and Janice, and is informed that he is going to be removed from the firm. They proceed to tell him that he was the reason they lost the Korean deal and that they knew he had stolen money from the company. Reuben attempts to explain but there is no use. They are not willing to negotiate, and they have already agreed that Reuben is fired. Reuben calls Sarah again and insists that he must see her, and she agrees to meet in a half hour. After the conversation there is a flashback to the party at Sarah and Paul’s house when they had last seen each other. During the party it is revealed that the girl Reuben had been writing the love letters to was Sarah. At the party Paul walks in the room when Reuben and Sarah are kissing; he does nothing. Reuben knows that when Paul did nothing it was completely out of character and he is never able to get the image out of his head. Returning to the present, Reuben is now at Sarah’s house. They talk about Paul but Reuben does not mention his encounter with him earlier that day. They talk about how Paul had begged Sarah to stay, which she did and then nine years later he told her that he was not happy anymore and was leaving for Vancouver to make movies. Sarah does most of the talking and Reuben leaves after he has no answer for her about whether Paul thought of her or his new lover in Vancouver. Later Reuben is back at his car when his phone rings. It is Phil, his brother. Phil is obviously rattled and is having trouble formulating his thoughts. Phil tells Reuben that Johnny, the third brother, was about to die and that he should come to Florida immediately. Reuben agrees and is on the next flight to Florida. The next scene Phil has just picked up Reuben from the airport. There is a decent amount of traffic that allows them to have a lengthy conversation. During the drive Phil reveals that he is leaving his wife Mary for a student he was teaching. He thought this was always bound to happen: “Every year, I worry about this. Every year they get more gorgeous. Or maybe I get less picky.” He tells Reuben everything, about how they met, how they first went out for a drink, and how he fell in love with her right away. He asks Reuben if something like this had ever happened to him before. He mentions once but nothing ever came of it and before he has a chance to tell Phil of the details, Phil receives a call from his mother informing him that Johnny has died. =Act two=Scene One Act two starts with Phil and his new girlfriend, Liz, at her place three months later. Reuben is still not at ease about the events of that day three months ago. Reuben wants so desperately to know what caused this train wreck of events. Reuben believes there should be a starting point where everything was set into motion, an exact moment. He can’t seem to find the moment and it haunts him. Phil tries to comfort him but Reuben isn't easily coaxed. Liz then enters the room and meets Reuben for the first time but leaves shortly to go skating. After Liz leaves, Reuben continues to talk about his philosophy of events and of life. “If I do this then I will get that” (Sherman 59). This is when Phil corrects Reuben and starts to explain chaos theory to him, even though Reuben does not want to hear it. Before Phil gets far Liz reenters, not being able to find her skate guards, and leaves quickly. Phil continues and tries to tell Reuben that he should not try to find the connections between events and that attempting to pinpoint the starting point would only drive him insane. Reuben does not want to hear his theory and leaves. Scene Two Reuben is wandering around the city when he runs into a Rabbi who convinces him to come and perform a minyan. A minyan refers to a quorum required for certain obligations; it is usually done in public with ten men. On their way to the shul they find out that they knew each other when they were younger. He asks how his brothers were doing and Reuben informs him that Johnny had died. The Rabbi then seems to look into Reuben's soul. He sees the pain in Reuben and the asks the same questions Reuben has been repeating in his head and adds a few more for some perspective. Although the rabbi feels the reason for Reuben's pain is his brother's passing he assists in helping Reuben find the answer. The rabbi tells Reuben why he did not recognize him as a Jew and tells a little bit of history about Jews as they arrive at the shul. When they arrive the rabbi takes him upstairs and leads him right to Sarah. Scene Three Reuben goes to Phil and Liz’s place to tell Phil of his encounter but only finds Liz. Phil is out on a run, so they make small talk for a while. They bounce through subjects about his drink, her skate guards, piano, when they finally move onto the subject of physics where Liz tries to explain chaos theory in a different way by telling him a story about a butterfly. “A butterfly leaves a tree somewhere, and it stirs the air, which effects the wind, which causes turbulence, which brings down a passenger jet” (Sherman 73). Reuben likes this analogy and superimposes his story right on top. He does not fully understand because he still feels like he controls his own destiny and that his actions mean something, but Liz explains that the decisions he make have an effect; he just cannot predict what that effect will be. They come to a stalling point in their conversation about what happened to Reuben, so Reuben asks her to play the piano for him and she does. Scene Four Sarah and Reuben are at a restaurant when Reuben tells Sarah about his encounter with Paul before they talked on that fateful day. They find out that this encounter was stranger than it seemed as everything he told Reuben about his life was in fact true. They come to the same question that Paul left both of them: “Do you need everything you have?” There are three other characters in this scene: a man, a woman and a man on the phone. They seem to almost be reacting to the events of Reuben's life. The man and woman are fighting about the man cheating on her and the man on the cell phone is talking about taking money from his company that he built from the ground up. Reuben still wants to know how this whole thing started and Sarah attempts to explain that things do just happen for no rhyme or reason. Sarah goes with him on this journey to find out where everything started going wrong, and during the process confesses that she would have run away with him if he had called. Reuben felt the same but both were too afraid to make the first move. Sarah comes to the conclusion that the time they kissed at the party ten years ago started everything. It caused Paul to finally leave Sarah and die on the plane. Then all the characters but Reuben start singing to Reuben about love and that tomorrow may never come. Sarah and Reuben continue their conversation. Sarah asks if he has moved on and started working again, but he has not. She offers a job to him as a new challenge. They start talking about \\"what ifs\\" and why they never called each other. They discover that they still have some of those feelings for each other and that they were real to both of them at one time. Scene Five Reuben goes back to Phil and Liz’s place, this time looking for Liz. She is playing the piano and says she has written something for him, something goofy. He tells Liz that he has started dating Sarah, the girl from the past and that even though he fell in love with her ten years ago he cannot stop thinking of someone else. He does not understand how he can think of someone else when he is finally with the woman he wanted to spend his entire life with. Liz asks if he has told the other woman. Reuben has not, but he feels that she knows. Through the dialog it is almost apparent that Liz is the other woman. Reuben asks her to play the song; she starts but can't finish and bangs her hand on the piano. Phil shows up back from his run completely out of breath, gasping, and asking for water. Reuben tells Phil about dating Sarah, which excites Phil. Phil then reveals that he and Liz had just bought a house. When Liz leaves the room, though, he reveals that he ran into Mary, his ex-wife, and now does not feel the same about Liz. Scene Six Reuben is at the subway when he sees Donna waiting as well. They begin talking and Reuben asks if she would like to go to a coffee shop. They ask how each other have been and Donna tells how she has met someone new, Bob. She has started on her masters, a book club, and a bunch of other endeavors. Reuben notes that she used to be that way when they were younger and that is who he fell in love with. She feels that it was his fault that she became someone different, that he smothered her. Donna told him how he never let her win an argument and never listened to what she had to say. After she is done ripping into him she mentions that the kids would like to see him, Reuben says he will call. Scene Seven Reuben and Sarah have gone over to Phil and Liz’s for dinner. Sarah and Phil are looking at photos of the new house while Reuben sits to the side drinking and thinking about Donna. He remembers when they bought their first house and when they first conceived a baby. Sarah leaves to go check on her kids. Phil tells Reuben how great Sarah is and lucky he is to have her. Reuben does not seem too convinced. They talk about the time when a group of them went up to the cabin with their wives. They have different accounts of the time there. Phil remembers it as wonderful, while Reuben thought it was awful. Phil then leaves to go check on dinner. Liz, who is celebrating her birthday that evening, enters with a new drink for Reuben. Liz does not like where they left off the last time they talked. Reuben seems to be getting annoyed with the subject. She seems to think that Reuben is getting to a better situation. Reuben is moving to another direction during the conversation and keeps referring to Liz as a child. Sarah then enters the room unnoticed about halfway through the conversation when Liz and Reuben kiss. Reuben backs away saying he is no good for anyone that he will suck the life out of her. Liz tries to convince him that she cares for him but he will not take it. Reuben goes back to the pinpoint of when everything started going wrong in his life and he has come up with a new theory, his birth. He feels the only thing one can do is wait out their life, wait \\"out the darkness” (Sherman 107). He feels you should live your life alone out of respect for others. Phil enters with some bread for an appetizer and tells Liz to go keep stirring the dinner. Liz leaves and they talk about how amazing Liz is that she can accomplish so much with her nerve disease. Sarah suggests going and getting the tapenade for the bread, and Phil leaves to go get it. Sarah then confronts Reuben about the kiss. Reuben talks about jumping out the window and goes to it and stares out it. He then flashes back to the party ten years ago. Phil, Paul and Donna enter the room. It is later in the party when Phil has come to a revelation. He explains that it came to him while he was outside taking a piss. Phil sees that we are all just particles floating around looking for an attachment. We will always be alone in the end so while we are here we can wait it out until the end, alone or cherish the fact that we are here and surround ourselves with the people we love. Phil has decided to do that later. It goes back to present time and Reuben answers “I know” (Sherman 113). And the play ends. Play Analysis This type of play became known as a well-made-play. However, in \\"Patience,\\" Jason Sherman takes viewers and readers to a non-linear route using flashbacks of the past, mainly a party ten years ago, which help give insight to the play's direction. The flashbacks help viewers understand the characters' thought processes and give answers to questions one might have about their lives. For example, when it is revealed that Sarah was the girl Reuben had written those letters to. With those flashbacks it is easy to see the seven components of a well-made-play. The order of these is as follows: 1\\\\. State of equilibrium-Reuben is a successful businessman and has a happy marriage with two kids. 2\\\\. Inciting incident- A friend from the past comes to visit Reuben while at dinner. He asks Reuben if he is happy and what he would do if he lost everything? He leaves Reuben with a final question, “Do you need everything you have?” 3\\\\. Point of Attack or Major Dramatic Question- Reuben does lose everything, he gets fired, his wife leaves him, and his brother dies. The question is then what will he do if he lost everything? 4\\\\. Rising action- This takes place three months later, why? Because his state of mind during those three months had not changed. Reuben has many talks with his brother Phil, Sarah, Liz, and a Rabbi about finding the point that started all of this. Why did this happen to him. Each character’s opinion and conversation helps him on his journey but leads to more question. 5\\\\. Climax- He runs into Donna at the subway. They have a lengthy conversation where she blames Reuben for all the troubles. Reuben had been looking for someone else to blame the whole time and never looked at himself. This is the first time he finally sees who was really to blame. 6\\\\. Resolution – He is coming to grips with the fact that it was his fault. He uses the starting point for when everything started going wrong as when he was born. It is apparent that he really took what Donna said to heart because he quotes her while talking to Liz. “I will suck the life out of you” 7\\\\. New state of equilibrium-At the end of the play Reuben says “I know” as a response to the end of a monologue by Phil in a flash back from the party. The basic outcome was that we are all alone and can either wait alone in the darkness or share our love with the ones that love us. Although it seems that Reuben has chosen the first route of being alone. Character Guide Reuben- He is the Protagonist. He travels along Freytag’s Pyramid while dealing with all that has happened to him. Donna- This is Reuben's wife. She finds the love letters between Reuben and Sarah and leaves Reuben. As well, she acts as the instigator in the climax. She puts Reuben in his place. Phil-he is Reuben's brother, and is support for Reuben throughout the play. He is the person Reuben goes to when he has questions that he needs answers to. Liz- is Phil’s new girlfriend. She is a talented 19/20 year old. She is there for Reuben when Phil is not around; they fall for each other a little. She writes him a song, paints him a picture. They eventually kiss, but Reuben turns her away. Sarah- was the love interest of Reuben many years before, and was the one who wrote the love letters back and forth with Reuben. They date again but it never was the same. Paul- is Reuben's old friend and Sarah’s husband, who acts as the inciting incident. After their encounter Reuben finds out that he had died in a plane crash a year before. Rabbi- he knew Reuben and his family as a young boy. He is able to really give much insight into how Reuben is feeling and leads him unknowingly right to Sarah. Peter- is Reuben's business partner and seems to be the main instigator within the situation of getting Reuben fired. He dislikes Reuben a lot and tries to get Reuben to fight him while they are telling Reuben he is being let go. Frank- The chairman of Reuben's company, he seems like he does not want to fire Reuben but sees no other choice. Janice-The accountant for Reuben's business, she find the discrepancy in Reuben's spending and feels that he is stealing from the company. Character Analysis Reuben is the Protagonist of our story. He is a wealthy business man who is so caught up in himself that he cannot see the events that are going to happen to him. Reuben's story follows a similar one of a David Mamet play called Edmond. Edmond is also a middle-class man who loses everything. Edmond's path to redemption is a much more violent and physical one as he deals with his feeling on race and homosexuality. Reuben's situation is much more a path through his mentality. He is obsessed with finding out why and how all these events got started. It takes the entire play for him to finally come to a peace although it is a very negative one. Reuben may be seen as the average middle class man and therefore his story can really hit home to a lot of people. Although his outcome is not one to hope for, the viewers are able to see his mistakes and misguided thought and learn from them. Phil, Liz and Sarah act as Reuben's confidants; he goes to them and tells them about his troubles. They try to help him but Reuben will not accept their advice. Paul acts as the messenger; he brings the warning of what is to come by acting as the force behind the inciting incident. Within this story there is a dialogue that has a ton of foreshadowing in it. Sherman also comes up with Reuben's final thought on life. That we are all alone and we can either wait in the darkness, which is the route that Reuben has chosen, or embrace that we are here and share our love with the ones that love us. The comic relief comes in the form of the rabbi. Although the rabbi does give viewers insight on how Reuben must be feeling, he reveals it in a comical manner. For example, when he calls Yahweh from his cell phone to find the answer to what is the point of being good. Genre This play falls under the genre of a classic tragedy. It starts with a state of equilibrium where there is a basic moral code. In Patience it is if you do your work you will be rewarded. Reuben worked hard at his job and became successful. He had a girl fall in love with him and they got married and had kids. Then the inciting incident happens when a character commits an act of shame. Reuben's business partners find that he has stolen from the company and his wife finds love letters to another woman. The plot develops as the character undergoes suffering. Reuben's brother dies and everywhere he searches for answers he is not able to find any. At the climax, the character receives some insight. Reuben runs into his ex-wife at the subway where she shows him how he is the reason for all that has gone wrong in his life. Not something or someone else. At the resolution the universal code is restored by some act of redemption. Reuben does not go through some act of redemption but he understands that because of his actions he deserves to be alone and that is what he intends to do. Style Jason Sherman wrote Patience mainly in a realist style. These scenes happen in real time; although he jumps from scene to scene each individual scene takes as long as it would in real time. The characters do not go to unrealistic places; they remain in the actual real world except for Reuben's encounter with Paul. This play stays on one storyline, Reuben is the main character and the play follows his path. The audience is an objective one; we are viewing the play from afar and are not involved in the story. It also follows a real issue of storyline, the time. This play was written in 1998 and is about a successful businessman who loses everything. Something that could be very possible in that time and especially in the world today. The play does not give the audience a fairytale ending. It ends with Reuben finally coming to grips with the fact that he is at fault for all the bad events in his life. Although most realist plays run in chronological order, other realist plays do not and are still considered realism because their scenes seem to fit together correctly in the order presented. This is true for Patience as there are flashbacks but at very strategic points that give the audience insight into why things have just happened as they did. In Patience there are elements of absurdism. Reuben, within his mentality is living in a world full of absurdism. He is at the mercy of a higher power, whatever that might be. By the end of the play he comes to terms that his life cannot be changed. A quote from A Student's Guide to Play Analysis demonstrates how much the theatre of absurd is involved: “The purpose of writing, therefore, is simply to express their despair and perhaps to share it with others; to find in a sense, comfort in knowing that they are not alone in realizing that they are in fact, completely alone” (Rush 232). This is almost the exact realization that Reuben finds at the end. Patience can also be seen as a postmodern play. Sherman gives the audience many thought-provoking monologues where characters explain their ideas on whether individuals control their destiny or that their actions have no barring on outcomes. The audience is faced with the question if all events connect or if they just happen randomly. The play focuses on the dialogue of the play and less on the story. The message of the play can be seen in those monologues. The play's structure does not go through chronological order it focuses on how closely the scenes are tied together. Theme The central question in this play is, \\"Are you happy with your life?\\" This is the concept that is present throughout the play. The long monologues try to give rhyme or reason to what has caused these tragic events in Reuben's life. But they are simply ways to try to help him cope with his losses. This play really makes one examine one's life and analyze what went wrong and why, to see if they are really happy with their life. It asks the audience questions like, do you have everything you need and do you need everything you have? If you were to lose everything you had tomorrow would you be able to cope? Reuben comes as a prime example of what not to do. He is overly self-centered and therefore he tries to blame everyone else. He never looks at himself and when he finally does at the end of the play he cannot bear it. The point is that one is not able to control every outcome of life whether events are connected or not. People must be able to be happy with themselves and the outcomes will not matter. Another theme to this play could be how in 1997 a study was produced with findings that revealed that Jewish men had depression rates twice as high as non-Jewish men. The study's reasons were due to alcohol but others came up with other conclusions. One in particular fits this play very well. “Dr. Susan Nolen- Hoeksema has attributed the greater susceptibility to depression to their more ruminative style of coping when distressed… it may explain the vulnerability to depression in Jewish men, whose religious training reinforces a ruminative quest for knowledge” (Why are Jewish…) Reuben is obsessed with finding an answer; his inability to find that answer leads him farther and farther down the path of depression. Language The language in this play moves from fast to slow. It goes from fast paced dialogues to slower monologues. In the normal conversations the characters are often interrupting each other. Quickly moving through their conversations as if they know what the other is going to say. It slows back down when one character really has something important to say. Sherman also uses singing within the dialogues. Those lines give a little insight on what is to come. The singing also attempts to hint at Reuben to see what he is missing. “So baby love me/ Love me tonight…Tomorrow was made for some/but tomorrow may never come” (Sherman 81). This is first heard when Reuben and Sarah are having dinner and it seems to be foreshadowing their romantic relationship. But it is also heard later in the play and could be seen as a call to Reuben to focus on the present. Spectacle In the playwright's notes Jason Sherman states “this play can and ought to be staged with elegance and simplicity. The first production features a multi-use set piece which became a car, a table in a restaurant, a desk and whatever else it was required to be.” (Sherman) It is not what is surrounds the characters that affects the audience, it is what the characters say that is the real spectacle. The play intrigues the audience to think about their lives and it does so by painting a picture with words. Music \\"For All we Know\\" is heard throughout the play. It is a song about living in and taking advantage of the present, centering on the lyrics \\"For tomorrow may never come\\". It falls within the constant message of the play, of being happy in one's own life. Production history Patience made its debut at the Tarragon Theatre in Toronto, Ontario. It made its U.S. debut in 2001 at the Wilma Theater in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. About The Author Jason Sherman was born in Montreal, Quebec on July 28, 1962. He moved to Toronto where he lives now. He graduated from York University in 1985 and then started What Publishing in 1985 with Kevin Connolly. Jason was the editor of What magazine. Also Sherman has won a Governors General Award in 1995 for his play Three in the Back. As well he won a Floyd S.

Nobody wants to feel like they're going to be preached at in the theatre. You want to feel like you are going to recognize something of yourself in what's going on stage otherwise, you feel left out.’\\"(Karch, Pierre) Works • A Place Like Pamela (1991) • To Cry is Not So (1991) • The League of Nathans (1992) • What the Russians Say (1993) • Field (1993) • The Merchant of Showboat (1993) • Three in the Back, Two in the Head (1994) • Reading Hebron (1995) • The Retreat (1996) • None is Too Many (1997) • Patience (1998) • It's All True (1999) An Acre of Time (1999/2000) • Afghanada (2006) Works cited *Doollie.com The Playwright's Database *Karch, Pierre. “Jason Sherman”.

It is owned by iHeartMedia and is licensed to serve Union City, Georgia. It operates from studios located at the Peachtree Palisades building in the Brookwood Hills district of Atlanta, and the transmitter is located in Tyrone. History This station began broadcasting in 1952 as WCOH-FM at Newnan, Georgia. =1985-2005= 96.7 began in April 1985 as WBUS, then became WWER in March 1987. Just a few months later, it became adult contemporary- formatted WMKJ in November 1987, staying there for well over a decade. In October 2000, it became Rhythmic Top 40 WLDA, branded as \\"Wild 96.7\\". WMKJ Becomes Wild 96.7 This lasted for only a year, becoming a simulcast of Rock AC-formatted \\"WMXV (Mix 105.7)\\" as WXVV on October 8, 2001.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2001/RR-2001-10-12.pdf The station was WBZY-FM, \\"96.7 the Buzz\\" from April 5, 2002 to May 5, 2005.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2002/RR-2002-04-12.pdf On that date, the Buzz was moved to 105.3 (and then to WKLS FM 96.1 as \\"Project 9-6-1\\"). 96.7 The Buzz Moves to 105.3 It was then WVWA (\\"Viva 96.7\\"), returning to a simulcast in south metro Atlanta of north metro's WWVA-FM \\"Viva 105.7\\" (formerly \\"Viva 105.3\\"). (Although this was the first time this broadcast callsign had actually been legally assigned , it had been previously used in a famous parody of radio, see links.) =2006-2007= On December 20, 2006, WVWA broke from the simulcast again and became adult contemporary as 96.7 Lite FM. The format and moniker and WLTM call letters were previously held locally on 94.9, which flipped to country music as \\"94.9 the Bull\\" and adopted new callsign WUBL two days earlier. Lite FM Atlanta Rekindled at 96.7 When WLTM aired as \\"94.9 Lite FM\\", it was the Atlanta affiliate for the nationally syndicated Delilah nighttime show; this was not the case on its 96.7 revival, as her show would be picked up by rival station WSB-FM (\\"B98.5\\"), and aired there until it was dropped in 2011. In March 2007, WLTM became the new home of Paul Harvey in Atlanta after a two- year stint on WYAY-FM \\"Eagle 106.7\\". Prior to that, Harvey was heard on sister station WGST AM 640. In November 2007, the station again began playing Christmas music, though with a decidedly more modern and diverse musical style than in its previous years on 94.9, and than competitor WSB-FM. When the format was suddenly moved and changed in December 2006, it ceased playing Christmas music, even though it was before Christmas Day. On December 26, 2007, WLTM became WWLG and took the moniker \\"96.7 the Legend\\", and began airing a classic country format. 2007 Holiday Format Change Rundown =2008-present= On September 6, 2010, WWLG started simulcasting rhythmic CHR sister station WWVA-FM 105.7, in effort to increase its overall market coverage, mostly in the southern parts of the Atlanta metropolitan area. The last songs on \\"The Legend\\" were \\"If We Make It Through December\\" by Merle Haggard and Linda Ronstadt's \\"When Will I Be Loved\\", which was then cut in the middle with the song \\"Let's Get It Started\\" by The Black Eyed Peas, launching the simulcast. Atlanta Doubles Its Groove This marked the station's return to a rhythmic format since WLDA's exit in October 2001, and marks the third time the two stations simulcasted each other. On November 14, 2010, the station changed its name to \\"WiLD 105.7 & 96.7\\", retaining the \\"Atlanta's Party Station\\" slogan. Groove Atlanta Evolving Wildly On March 28, 2013, at 11:00 a.m., due to low ratings most likely caused by Power 96-1's launch in August 2012, WWVA/WWLG began stunting with a loop of \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth\\" and \\"Radio Song\\" by R.E.M.. Just after Noon, the stations became \\"Radio 105.7\\", with an alternative rock format similar to 92.9 Dave FM and 99X, which both flipped in late 2012. Alternative Returns to Atlanta Radio 105.7 Launches On April 11, 2013, WWLG's call letters were changed to WRDG, while WWVA's call letters were changed to WRDA. On November 11, 2016, at 9:23 a.m., WRDG dropped the simulcast of WRDA (who continued with the alternative format), flipped to mainstream urban as \\"92.3 & 96.7 The Beat\\", and began simulcasting on translator W222AF FM 92.3 (who also dropped its contemporary Spanish format). \\"The Beat\\" launched with 10,000 songs in a row, and began carrying The Breakfast Club (which had previously been heard on W233BF) in morning drive starting December 5. The flip made the pair the fourth current-based hip hop station in the market, the other three being WVEE, WHTA and the aforementioned W233BF.iHeart Debuts The Beat 92.3/96.7 Atlanta On April 12, 2018, W222AF was taken off-the-air by its owner because iHeart's lease of the translator expired. Another Atlanta FM Loses Its Translator On May 4, 2020, iHeart moved the \\"Beat\\" moniker, airstaff, and urban format to WBZY (105.3 FM), as that signal has a larger coverage area than 96.7. The Beat Moves in Atlanta WRDG continued to simulcast 105.3 FM until May 18, when it switched to a simulcast of WBZY. The WRDG call letters would move to 105.3 on the same date; in turn, 96.7 FM would adopt the WRDA call sign and then the WBZW calls on May 26, 2020.Z105.7 Atlanta Readds 96.7 Simulcast Radioinsight - May 18, 2020 Previous logos File:WLTM-FM.png File:WRDA logo.png File:WRDA radio105.7 logo.png ReferencesExternal links * *WVWA Parody Site *Scott Fybush's article on (the fake) WVWA BZW Category:Radio stations established in 1952 Category:1952 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) BZW Category:IHeartMedia radio stations ","title":"WBZW"},{"id":"21771740","text":"Skachki platform () was a railway platform located in St. Petersburg, Russia.

Hirst & G. A. Piersol, Human monstrosities. Wellcome L0027955. (1893) Dicephalic parapagus () is a rare form of partial twinning with two heads side by side on one torso. Infants conjoined this way are sometimes called \\"two-headed babies\\" in popular media. The condition is also called parapagus dicephalus. If carried to term, most dicephalic twins are stillborn, or die soon after birth. A small number are known to have survived to adulthood. The extent to which limbs and organs are duplicated varies from case to case. One head may be only partially developed (anencephalic), or both may be complete. In some cases, two complete hearts are present as well, which improves their chances of survival. The total number of arms may be two, three or four. Their prospects are best if no attempt is made to separate them, except in cases in which one twin is clearly dying. Terminology Dicephalus means two-headed. Parapagus means joined side by side. Dicephalic twins are called: * dibrachius if they have two arms all together (one for each twin), * tribrachius, if they have three arms all together, * tetrabrachius, if they have four arms all together, * dipus, if they have two legs all together (one for each twin). Incidence Conjoined twins appear in one in 50,000 to one in 100,000 births. Dicephalic twins represent about 11 percent of all conjoined twins. Medical and social response As late as the 1960s, some medical publications argued that newborn dicephalic twins should not be actively treated or resuscitated. An attempt at surgical separation was reported in a paper published in 1982, but did not result in long-term survival of either twin. In more recent cases in Turkey and Minnesota, doctors advised that separation surgery would not be appropriate. Dicephalic twins who survived past infancy Giacomo and Giovanni Battista Tocci (1877–1940), were Italian male dicephalus parapagus twins who survived to adulthood. Each had his own pair of arms. They had two legs all together, one of which was controlled by each twin. They were exhibited in freak shows as children and teenagers. The Toccis learned to speak several languages, but never learned to walk. Abby and Brittany Hensel, born in Minnesota in 1990, also are dicephalus parapagus twins who grew up. They were born with two functional arms, plus a vestigial third arm, which was surgically removed. Each twin has her own complete head, heart and spine, and controls one arm and one leg. They learned to walk around the same age as average children, went on to attend school, learn to drive, play sports, and completed courses at college. Twin girls conjoined like the Tocci brothers, with four arms and two legs all together, were born in Turkey in 2000. As with the Toccis and the Hensels, it was found that each twin controlled one leg. Because of the size of their upper body, the Turkish twins needed a special program of exercises before they could learn to walk. After that, they learned to run and climb stairs without further specialist help, and at age 11 they were going to school with other children. See also * Craniopagus parasiticus is another form of partial twinning which results in two heads kept alive by a single torso. In these cases a second, vestigial torso is present, and the heads are joined directly to one another. * Diprosopus is a condition in which there are duplicated facial features on one head. * Polycephaly is a general term about organisms with more than one head.

TV Guide awarded the film 2 out of 4 stars stating that it \\"serve[d] no purpose but to sate juvenile blood lust and to take people's money\\".

Founded by Winston Panchacharam in 2000, Amutham specialises in Carnatic music and Indian devotional music. Sriranjani by Sudha Ragunathan was Amutham's first release. Although it was intended as a one-off to help raise Sudha Ragunathan's professional profile outside of India, it became such a success that Panchacharam decided to release a few more recordings.

Early releases featured classic compositions by composers like Thyagaraja and Dikshithar, considered the Mozart and Beethoven of the Carnatic repertoire. Later releases moved onto more modern composers like Papanasam Sivan and Subramania Bharathiyar. One feature of these thematic presentations by Amutham Music is that no piece would be recorded by one artist and then re- recorded by another. Other types of Amutham theme recordings have focused on a song's subject rather than composers. Amutham's top-selling CDs include \\"The Dance of Shiva\\" by Sudha Ragunathan, and \\"Ragam Vol. 1\\" by Nithyasree Mahadevan - the first of which popularises compositions of Lord Nataraja (the cosmic form of Shiva), while the latter album is made up of songs in which the governing raga is mentioned either at the beginning of the composition, or is the subject of the composition.

However, it lists Fer (Dam Fer, Fertit) as synonyms; in Blench's and earlier classifications, Fer is a Bagirmi language, and Ethnologue does not list a separate Fer language for CAR.

The workshop undertakes the periodic overhauling of passenger main line coaches. It also manufactures wheel sets for the workshop as well as various Locomotives in Mumbai. History The workshop is spread over an area of around 14 Hectares in the heart of the city of Mumbai. The workshop was originally a Locomotive repair workshop during the British period and came up between the year 1870-76. The workshop was set up by the erstwhile BB&CIBombay; Baroda and Central India Railway as a centralised workshop for BG locomotives, Railway passenger carriages and wagon stock. Later, as the repair activities were expanded with progressive increases in the holding of locomotives, coaches and wagons, a separate wagon repair workshop was set up at Mahalaxmi in 1910 as an extension to this workshop under its administrative setup. With further expansion of repair activities, a separate locomotive workshop was constructed at Dahod in the year 1928, thereby transferring all repair activities relating to locomotive repairs to Dahod workshop. Lower Parel and Mahalaxmi workshops were, therefore, left with carrying out repairs to coaching and wagon stock. In the year 1959, a separate wagon repair workshop was built at Kota. Repairs to the suburban electrical multiple stocks was progressively centralised at Mahalaxmi shop. New Bogie Repair and Lifting Shed and NTL (New Trial Line) Shed were constructed in Lower Parel Shop in 1984. New RAC Shed was constructed in 1993. The oldest structure still available in the workshop premises is the Senior Railway Institute which has a foundation stone dated 1882. The Administrative Building was constructed in the year 1900. Another heritage value item still preserved is the cast iron bell manufactured in the year 1890 and a wall clock manufactured by Gillette & Co., England in the year 1889. Both of them are still in working condition. Main Activity The workshop undertakes the periodic overhauling of two main types of coaches. The first category of the coach is known as the ICF design coaches. The second category of the coach is the LHB design coaches. In a year, 1500 coaches are POHed at Lower Parel Workshop. They include the General Class coaches, Sleeper class, Three tier, Two tier and the First class Air Conditioned coaches. It also undertakes the POH of Milk Tankers of the NDDB ( National Dairy Development Board). The average outturn of the coaches has increased from 1,463 in the year 1990 to 1,530 in the year 2008. Out of 1,530 coaches, 330 coaches are air conditioned coaches. The air-conditioned coach outturn has increased from 192 in the year 1990 to 330 in the year 2008. The average POH cycle for the coach is 25 days. It also manufactures wheel sets for the workshop divisions as well as the EMU workshop at Mahalaxmi. The average supply of wheel sets is 12000 wheel sets per year out of which 120 wheel sets are sent to the divisions and another 120 wheel sets to EMU workshop Infrastructure The workshop is spread in an area of 14 hectares with a covered area of 5500 sq. m. The rail track length in the workshop is 5.5 km. Water requirement is 475 Kiloliters per day. Compressed air requirement is around 3000CFM per day. An amount of Rs. 1.50 Billion is the money annually spent on various activities. Labor constitutes 30% of the budget grant and stores constitute another 30%, the rest is inter Railway debits. The average cost is around Rs. Five Lakh per coach. The expenditure on each PCV (Passenger Coaching Vehicle) is Rs. 5.14 Lakhs, Other Commercial vehicles is Rs 4.26 Lakhs & LHB coaches is Rs. 5.72 Lakhs. The workshop is headed by the Chief Workshop manager. There are five departments dealing with various activities such as Mechanical, Electrical, Materials Management, Finance & Accounts, HRD, Audit & Security. It has a total employee strength of 5,110.

Overview The former Olivera mansion Avellaneda Park Historic Train. The merry-go-round (installed in 1966, it's one of 52 in the city) Nearly 5 km (3 mi) west of colonial Buenos Aires (little more than a hamlet at the time), an extensive plot of land was deeded in 1755 to the Brotherhood of the Holy Charity of Jesus Christ, who established an orphanage and the area's largest herbal remedy plantation. The \\"Remedy Farm\\" was purchased by Domingo Olivera in 1828, who maintained the herbal plantation and established the newly independent nation's first agricultural research station there. His son, Eduardo, became a licensed agronomist, a founding member of the influential Argentine Rural Society and organizer of the country's first agricultural exposition, in 1866. The Olivera family sold the estate to the city of Buenos Aires in 1912 and, under the direction of City Parks Commissioner Charles Thays, the land was inaugurated as Olivera Park in 1914 (Olivera Park was renamed in honor of former President Nicolás Avellaneda later that year). The 50 hectare (125 acre) park was the city's largest continuous green space and in 1916, the city installed its municipal tree farm on the park's western end for landscaping needs throughout Buenos Aires. Educator Antonio Zaccagnini opened a school for disabled children on the park's eastern end in 1925 and in 1930, following the passing of the Director of the Buenos Aires Zoo, Clemente Onelli, the ridable miniature railway he had installed at the zoo for children was relocated to Avellaneda Park. The widening of Francisco Bilbao Avenue during the 1950s separated an 8 hectare (20 acre) southern section of the park, which was converted for use by Edenor, the public electric utility serving the area. The most dramatic change in the park's dimensions, however, took place after military-appointed Mayor Osvaldo Cacciatore's expropriation of a wide swath along Bilbao Avenue in 1977. The land was slated for the Perito Moreno Freeway, one of eight Cacciatore approved (though only three were built). Opened in 1980, the freeway's toll plaza takes up much of what was the park's southern section. These developments and nationwide economic malaise during the 1980s contributed to the park's decline. The first reversal of this came in 1989, when the former Olivera mansion was reopened as a cultural center, following years of disuse. A descendant of the mansion's namesake family, Enrique Olivera, became Mayor of Buenos Aires following the election of his predecessor, Fernando de la Rúa, to the Argentine Presidency. As Vice-Mayor, Olivera had initiated restoration projects for the ailing park and in July 2000, he reopened the Onelli miniature railway and inaugurated the Remedy Farm Cultural Center, a homage to the land's original use.

The use of the word \\"end\\" in the title has two meanings: primarily, as a synonym for \\"purpose\\", but also as a prediction about the future of public schools if they do not successfully identify and communicate a convincing purpose for their existence within our culture.  Content  Part I = Postman begins by emphasizing the difference between education and schooling: > \\"To the young, schooling seems relentless, but we know it is not. What is > relentless is our education, which, for good or ill, gives us no rest. That > is why poverty is a great educator. Having no boundaries and refusing to be > ignored, it mostly teaches hopelessness. But not always. Politics is also a > great educator. Mostly, it teaches, I am afraid, cynicism. But not always. > Television is a great educator as well. Mostly it teaches consumerism. But > not always.\\" (pg. ix.) Postman believes that schools' primary social function is to create a common culture among citizens through the communication of unifying purpose-giving narratives rather than to simply initiate children into the economy. > “The idea of public education depends absolutely on the existence of shared > narratives and the exclusion of narratives that lead to alienation and > divisiveness. What makes public schools public is not so much that the > schools have common goals but that the students have common gods. The reason > for this is that public education does not serve a public. It creates a > public.” (pg. 17) Furthermore, he feels American education has drifted away from its founding narratives of democracy and Individual rights, replaced by the narratives of economic utility and the belief in technology as the measure of humanity's progress. Postman believes that the school system's current narratives at best, fail to sufficiently inspire and, all too often, fail to communicate anything at all. Chief among the failing gods is Economic Utility, the view of school's highest purpose as preparation for the workplace. > \\"The preparation for making a living... is well served by any decent > education.\\" (pg. 32, 33) “Here it is necessary to say that no reasonable > argument can be made against educating the young to be consumers or to think > about the kinds of employment that might interest them. But when these are > elevated to the status of a metaphysical imperative, we are being told that > we have reached the end of our wits—even worse, the limit of our wisdom.” > (pg. 35,36) = Part II = In the second part of the book, Postman proposes 5 narratives as possible alternatives to the current ones: * \\"Spaceship Earth\\" (the notion of humans as stewards of the planet) * \\"The Fallen Angel\\" (a view of history and the advancement of knowledge as a series of errors and corrections) * \\"The American Experiment\\" (the story of America as a great experiment and as a center of continuous argument) * \\"The Laws of Diversity\\" (the view that difference contributes to increased vitality and excellence, and, ultimately, to a sense of unity) * \\"The Word Weavers/The World Makers\\" (the understanding that the world is created through language — through definitions, questions, and metaphors) http://www.scottlondon.com/reviews/postman2.html  References External links *Book Review by Scott London *essay by Bradley A.

They are organized as a militia long-range reconnaissance patrol scout type unit, unlike the full-time counterterrorism Army Reconnaissance Detachment 10 (ARD 10) unit. Formed in the 1970s, they fall under the operational control of the Swiss Air Force.Ryan, p. 69 History The Parachute Reconnaissance Company 17 (FSK-17) of today, comes from the Remote Reconnaissance Company 17 (Fernspäh Kp 17) which came from the first and only Swiss parachute company, the Parachute Grenadier Company 17 (Fallschirmgrenadier Kp 17). While the names have changed, the number 17 has been a constant in Switzerland's only parachute company, leading current and former members to refer to themselves as a \\"17-er\\".History of FSK-17 accessed 22 April 2009 Training FSK-17 Training program for NCOs and officers FSK-17, like most of the Swiss Air Force, is a militia based service, which makes selection and training different from in most militaries. At about age 16 a candidate will register online for the SPHAIR course with the Aero-Club der Schweiz.Your way to become a Fallschirmaufklärer accessed 22 April 2009 About 500 to 700 candidates will generally apply. Over the following year the candidate will provide documentation to prove their Swiss citizenship and will attend a one-day screening in Dübendorf near Zürich. About 300 candidates will attend the screening but only 90 of them will pass the screening and educational requirements and be allowed to enroll in the parachute courses. At age 18 the candidate attends the first two-week parachute course. While most of the cost of the course is covered by the Swiss Army, candidates have to buy some of their own equipment and books, which cost the candidate about CHF 750.Course Description of Parachute Course 1 accessed 22 April 2009 Successful completion of the first parachute course allows the candidate to attend the second course when they are about 19 years old. This course also costs the candidate about CHF 500.Course Description of Parachute Course 2 accessed 22 April 2009 Following two successful parachute courses the candidate will have to pass a series of physical and psychological exams of which only about 20 will pass. Throughout all this training the candidate is still a civilian. If the candidate is successful in their pre-military training, they then enter either a 43-week (enlisted) or 59-week (officer) training program. Following recruitment into the military the candidate attends a five-week selection training course. This course includes firearms training as well as physical fitness, obstacle courses, and marching. While portions of the standard Swiss Army basic training are included, this course focuses on the elements that are relevant for the company. There are weekly marches of increasing length and difficulty, culminating in the \\"Ironman\\" exercise which must be passed by each candidate. Those that fail the training at this point are shifted into another specialization.Swiss Air Force-Basic Training for FSK-17 accessed 22 April 2009 Parachute Reconnaissance Company 17 uniform and gear Following the five- week course a candidate then enters the second selection phase, a four-week examination of their parachute-related abilities. This course also builds on their civilian parachute experience to train them in military parachuting. Therefore, in the first week they complete a night parachute jump. The course also includes further weapons training, physical training, and computer-aided intelligence training. At the end of the course, some candidates will be dismissed from the training and will complete their military service in another speciality. The remaining training time is spent working mostly as part of a team. Some individual training relates to building of bivouacs, behaviour and patrolling in the hostile area as well as approaches with contact with dogs. They train with round-canopy T-10 parachutes for low altitude jumps (about above ground level) as well as HALO/HAHO from over . Training also includes parachuting into landing zones in the mountains as well as in water. The culmination of this training is a multi-day training exercise in which the different elements of the training in the general context are used. Following successful completion of the entire training course the candidate is breveted and joins the company.

The Navy suggested to Wright that it purchase the Lawrance company and build the J-1 itself. In May 1923, Lawrance was purchased by Wright Aeronautical, with the J-1 being further developed by Wright into the J-5, J-6, and R-795.Gunston, p. 125, 244 Products * Lawrance A-3 * Lawrance C-2 1917 * Lawrance J-1 * Lawrance J-2 * Lawrance L-1 * Lawrance L-2 * Lawrance L-3 * Lawrance L-4 a.k.a.

Life James was born in Glamorgan, south Wales in 1569. He was educated at the University of Oxford, initially matriculating as a member of St Edmund Hall in 1586 and later graduating from Jesus College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1589 and a Master of Arts degree in 1592. He became a Fellow of Jesus College sometime in 1589 or 1590, a position he held until about 1596. After his ordination, his career was assisted by William Morgan, translator of the Bible into Welsh and Bishop of Llandaff after 1595. James became vicar of Caerleon in 1596, rector of Shirenewton in 1597, rector of Llangattock-juxta- Usk in 1598, vicar of Llangattock Feibion Afel in 1599 (all these in the county of Monmouthshire, and vicar of Llangattock-juxta-Neath, Glamorgan in 1603. He was appointed chancellor of the diocese of Llandaff in 1606. Whilst one source gives his date of death as 1610, another suggests it was as late as 1620. Works James translated the first Book of Homilies into Welsh in 1606. These were twelve authorised sermons on fundamental aspects of Christianity to be read in churches where there was no authorised preacher. This work was inspired by the activities of William Morgan, although Morgan died in 1604 before the work was published. The linguistic style of the translation owes much to Morgan, and in its turn influenced poets such as Rhys Prichard. Further editions were published in 1817 (John Roberts of Tremeirchion, Flintshire) and in 1847 (Morris Williams (\\"Nicander\\")).

It corresponds to Middle Coles Creek, chronologically between the Bayland Phase and Kings Crossing Phase. Location The Aden Site is located on the south bank of Jeff Davis Bayou, a mile and a half east of the unincorporated community of Valley Park, Issaquena County, Mississippi, U.S.A., near coordinates . Site description The site consists of three platform mounds making a triangular arrangement surrounding a small plaza, with the fourth side of the plaza bordered by Jeff Davis Bayou. This is considered to be a typical Coles Creek phase settlement pattern. The largest, designated Mound A, on the eastern border of the plaza is in height, with the summit surface area measuring by . The second largest mound, Mound B on the southern border of the plaza, is high, and measuring by at its base. Mound C, located on the western border of the plaza, is high and in diameter. Mound C has been heavily degraded by cultivation, and may have been larger. Aden Phase Aden Phase (800-900 CE) is a classification of sites and artifacts of the Cole Creek Culture created by Phillip Phillips. Aden Phase sites are distributed throughout western Mississippi, in the area east of the Mississippi River and North of the Yazoo River except for the Blackely and Haynes Bluff sites which are along the Southern bank of the Yazoo River. The original Cole Creek site had become better known as the Gordon site and was considered an example of the late Gordon period of the Plaquemine culture. Sites such as Greenhouse and French Fork showed evidence of multiple occupations over a long period resulting in pottery that from multiple cultures. The Aden Phase was an attempt to create a new baseline for “classic” Cole Creek Culture which could be then be used as a reference when comparing it to other cultures. Aden Phase sites are distributed throughout western Mississippi, in the area east of the Mississippi River and North of the Yazoo River except for the Blackely and Haynes Bluff sites which are along the Southern bank of the Yazoo River. Aden artifacts The Aden Phase was originally represented by the pottery styles identified as Baytown Plain, var. Valley Park; Chevalier Stamped, var Chevalier; Coles Creek Incised, vars. Coles and Wade; Evansville Punctuated, var. Rhinehart; French Fork Incised, var. Larkin ; Marzique Incised, var. Marzique; and Mulberry Creek Cord Marked, var. Smith Creek. The sites now considered the best examples of “typical” Aden Phase are, in descending order of importance Coles Creek Incised, vars. Coles Creek, Campbellsville, and Macedonia, and French Fork Incised, var Larkin. Pottery of the Aden Phase tended towards simple designs; regular shapes, unmodified rims and few appendages. Their surfaces were typically light gray, clouded by firing and bits of white material embedded in the earthenware. Triangular, zig zag and crescents were also present as decoration. Settlements Aden Phase settlements were the first example of the rectangular shaped mounds that have become a hallmark of Cole Creek Culture settlements, though some sites have older conical mounds from the Bayland phase remained in sites that were continually inhabited since that time. In the Aden Phase, settlements began to be built in a planned fashion with three rectangular mounds of approximately equal size forming a ceremonial center to the town with the three mounds forming three sides of a rectangular space.

For a fast path to be effective it must handle the most commonly occurring tasks more efficiently than the 'normal' path, leaving the latter to handle uncommon cases, corner cases, error handling, and other anomalies. Fast paths are a form of optimization.How to Choose the Best Router Switching Path for Your Network For example dedicated packet routing hardware used to build computer networks will often support software dedicated to handling the most common kinds of packets, with other kinds, for example with control information or packets directed at the device itself instead of being routed elsewhere, put on the metaphorical \\"slow path\\", in this example usually implemented by software running on the control processor. Specific implementations of networking software architectures have been developed that leverage the concept of a fast path to maximize the performance of packet processing software. In these implementations, the networking stack is split into two layers and the lower layer, typically called the fast path, processes the majority of incoming packets outside the OS environment without incurring any of the OS overheads that degrade overall performance. Only those rare packets that require complex processing are forwarded to the OS networking stack, which performs the necessary management, signaling and control functions. Some hardware RAID controllers implement a \\"fast path\\" for write-through access which bypasses the controller's cache in certain situations. This tends to increase IOPS, particularly for solid-state drives.

Chynadiyovo (Ukrainian: Чинадієвe, Чинадієво; Rusyn: Чинадійово; Hungarian: Szentmiklós, Russian: Чинадиево, Slovak: Činadno) is an urban-type settlement in Mukacheve Raion of Zakarpattia Oblast, Ukraine. It stands in the Latorica River valley, 10 km from the town of Mukacheve. Population: . The town took its Hungarian name from the church of St. Nicholas (Szentmiklós). Its history can be traced to the 13th century. King Béla IV presented the area to his son-in-law, Rostislav Mikhailovich, in 1247. It changed hands many times in the 14th century. Péter Perényi, who owned Szentmiklós in the early 15th century, commenced building a castle. It suffered serious damage at the hands of Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski's forces in 1657. The surviving edifice is the upshot of Francis I Rákóczi's rebuilding campaign. After the defeat of Rákóczi's War for Independence Emperor Charles VI gave Mukacheve and Chynadiyovo to Archbishop Lothar Franz von Schönborn. A year later it passed to his nephew, Bishop Friedrich Karl von Schönborn- Buchheim. The Schönborn era continued in Chynadiyovo well into the 20th century. The Mukachevo-Chynadiyovo estate was one of the largest in Eastern Europe. As of 1731, the estate comprised 200 villages and 4 towns, covering an area of some 2,400 km2. The town's most striking landmark is the hunting lodge of the Schönborns, originally built of timber, but rebuilt as a large country residence to a fanciful revivalist design in the 1890s.

The name RPM refers to file format and the package manager program itself. RPM was intended primarily for Linux distributions; the file format is the baseline package format of the Linux Standard Base. Although it was created for use in Red Hat Linux, RPM is now used in many Linux distributions such as Fedora, CentOS, OpenSUSE, OpenMandriva and Oracle Linux. It has also been ported to some other operating systems, such as Novell NetWare (as of version 6.5 SP3), IBM's AIX (as of version 4), IBM i, and ArcaOS. An RPM package can contain an arbitrary set of files. Most RPM files are “binary RPMs” (or BRPMs) containing the compiled version of some software. There are also “source RPMs” (or SRPMs) containing the source code used to build a binary package. These have an appropriate tag in the file header that distinguishes them from normal (B)RPMs, causing them to be extracted to /usr/src on installation. SRPMs customarily carry the file extension “.src.rpm” (.spm on file systems limited to 3 extension characters, e.g. old DOS FAT). History RPM was originally written in 1997 by Erik Troan and Marc Ewing, based on , , and experiences. was written by Rik Faith and Doug Hoffman in May 1995 for Red Hat Software, its design and implementations influenced greatly by , a package management system by Faith and Kevin Martin in the fall of 1993 for the Bogus Linux Distribution. preserves the \\"Pristine Sources + patches\\" paradigm of , while adding features and eliminating arbitrary limitations present in the implementation. provides greatly enhanced database support for tracking and verifying installed packages Features For a system administrator performing software installation and maintenance, the use of package management rather than manual building has advantages such as simplicity, consistency and the ability for these processes to be automated and non- interactive. rpm uses Berkeley DB as the backend database although since 4.15 in 2019, it supports building rpm packages without Berkeley DB (\`–disable- bdb\`). Features of RPM include: * RPM packages can be cryptographically verified with GPG and MD5 * Original source archive(s) (e.g. , ) are included in SRPMs, making verification easier * Delta update: PatchRPMs and DeltaRPMs, the RPM equivalent of a patch file, can incrementally update RPM-installed software * Automatic build-time dependency evaluation. Local operations Packages may come from within a particular distribution (for example Red Hat Enterprise Linux) or be built for it by other parties (for example RPM Fusion for Fedora). Circular dependencies among mutually dependent RPMs (so-called \\"dependency hell\\") can be problematic; in such cases a single installation command needs to specify all the relevant packages. =Repositories= RPMs are often collected centrally in one or more repositories on the internet. A site often has its own RPM repositories which may either act as local mirrors of such internet repositories or be locally maintained collections of useful RPMs. =Front ends= Several front-ends to RPM ease the process of obtaining and installing RPMs from repositories and help in resolving their dependencies. These include: * yum used in Fedora, CentOS 5 and above, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and above, Scientific Linux, Yellow Dog Linux and Oracle Linux * DNF, introduced in Fedora 18 (default since 22), Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and CentOS Linux 8. * up2date used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS 3 and 4, and Oracle Linux * Zypper used in Mer (and thus Sailfish OS), MeeGo, openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise * urpmi used in Mandriva Linux, ROSA Linux and Mageia * apt-rpm, a port of Debian's Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) used in Ark Linux, PCLinuxOS and ALT Linux * Smart Package Manager, used in Unity Linux, available for many distributions including Fedora. * , a command-line utility available in (for example) Red Hat Enterprise Linux =Local RPM installation database= Working behind the scenes of the package manager is the RPM database, stored in . It uses Berkeley DB as its back-end. It consists of a single database () containing all of the meta information of the installed RPMs. Multiple databases are created for indexing purposes, replicating data to speed up queries. The database is used to keep track of all files that are changed and created when a user (using RPM) installs a package, thus enabling the user (via RPM) to reverse the changes and remove the package later. If the database gets corrupted (which is possible if the RPM client is killed), the index databases can be recreated with the command. Description Whilst the RPM format is the same across different Linux distributions, the detailed conventions and guidelines may vary across them. =Package filename and label= An RPM is delivered in a single file, normally with a filename in the format: : for source packages, or : for binaries. For example, in the package filename , the is , the is , the is , and the is . The associated source package would be named RPMs with the extension do not depend on a particular CPU architecture. For example, these RPMs may contain graphics and text for other programs to use. They may also contain shell scripts or programs written in other interpreted programming languages such as Python. The RPM contents also include a package label, which contains the following pieces of information: * software name * software version (the version taken from original upstream source of the software) * package release (the number of times the package has been rebuilt using the same version of the software). This field is also often used for indicating the specific distribution the package is intended for by appending strings like \\"mdv\\" (formerly, \\"mdk\\") (Mandriva Linux), \\"mga\\" (Mageia), \\"fc4\\" (Fedora Core 4), \\"rhl9\\" (Red Hat Linux 9), \\"suse100\\" (SUSE Linux 10.0) etc. * architecture for which the package was built (i386, i686, x86_64, ppc, etc.) The package label fields do not need to match the filename. =Library packaging= Libraries are distributed in two separate packages for each version. One contains the precompiled code for use at run-time, while the second one contains the related development files such as headers, etc. Those packages have \\"-devel\\" appended to their name field. The system administrator should ensure that the versions of the binary and development packages match. =Binary format= The format is binary and consists of four sections: * The lead, which identifies the file as an RPM file and contains some obsolete headers. * The signature, which can be used to ensure integrity and/or authenticity. * The header, which contains metadata including package name, version, architecture, file list, etc. * A file archive (the payload), which usually is in cpio format, compressed with gzip. The tool enables retrieval of the cpio file without needing to install the RPM package. ** The Linux Standard Base requires the use of gzip, but Fedora 30 packages are xz- compressed and Fedora 31 packages might be zstd-compressed. Recent versions of RPM can also use bzip2, lzip, or lzma compression. ** RPM 5.0 format supports using xar for archiving. =SPEC file= The \\"Recipe\\" for creating an RPM package is a spec file. Spec files end in the \\".spec\\" suffix and contain the package name, version, RPM revision number, steps to build, install, and clean a package, and a changelog. Multiple packages can be built from a single RPM spec file, if desired. RPM packages are created from RPM spec files using the rpmbuild tool. Spec files are usually distributed within SRPM files, which contain the spec file packaged along with the source code. =SRPM= A typical RPM is pre-compiled software ready for direct installation. The corresponding source code can also be distributed. This is done in an SRPM, which also includes the \\"SPEC\\" file describing the software and how it is built. The SRPM also allows the user to compile, and perhaps modify, the code itself. A software package could contain only platform independent scripts. In such a case, the developer could provide only an SRPM, which is still an installable RPM. =NOSRC= This is a special version of SRPM. It contains \\"SPEC\\" file and optionally patches, but does not include sources (usually because of license). Forks , there are two versions of RPM in development: one led by the Fedora Project and Red Hat, and the other by a separate group led by a previous maintainer of RPM, a former employee of Red Hat. =RPM.org= The rpm.org community's first major code revision was in July 2007; version 4.8 was released in January 2010, version 4.9 in March 2011, 4.10 in May 2012, 4.11 in January 2013, 4.12 in September 2014 and 4.13 in July 2015. This version is used by distributions such as Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivatives, openSUSE, SUSE Linux Enterprise, Unity Linux, Mageia, OpenEmbedded, Tizen and OpenMandriva Lx (formerly Mandriva). =RPM v5= Jeff Johnson, the RPM maintainer since 1999, continued development efforts together with participants from several other distributions. RPM version 5 was released in May 2007. This version is used by distributions such as Wind River Linux (until Wind River Linux 10), Rosa Linux, and OpenMandriva Lx (former Mandriva Linux which switched to rpm5 in 2011) and also by the OpenPKG project which provides packages for other common UNIX-platforms. OpenMandriva Lx is going to switch back to rpm.org for 4.0 release. OpenEmbedded, the last major user of RPM5, switched back to rpm.org due to issues in RPM5.(archived) See also * Autopackage -- a \\"complementary\\" package management system * Delta ISO -- an ISO image which contains RPM Package Manager files * dpkg -- package management system used by Debian and its derivatives * List of RPM-based Linux distributions * pkg- config -- queries libraries to compile software from its source code References * External links * RPM.org project home page * RPM and DPKG command reference * The story of RPM by Matt Frye in Red Hat Magazine * How to create an RPM package * Video tutorials for Building and Patching the RPMs * RPM Notes - Building RPMs the easy way * Packaging software with RPM, Part 1: Building and distributing packages * Learn Linux, 101: RPM and YUM package management Category:Archive formats Category:Free package management systems Category:Linux package management-related software Category:Red Hat software ","title":"RPM Package Manager"},{"id":"21772278","text":"is a Japanese online community for artists. It was first launched as a beta test on September 10, 2007 by Takahiro Kamitani and Takanori Katagiri. Pixiv Inc. is headquartered in Sendagaya, Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan. As of September 2016, the site consists of over 20 million members, over 43 million submissions, and receives over 3.7 billion page views monthly. Pixiv aims to provide a place for artists to exhibit their illustrations and get feedback via a rating system and user comments. Works are organized in an extensive tag structure which forms the backbone of the website. History Starting as the idea of the programmer Takahiro Kamitani, who is himself an artist known as Bakotsu on the website, Pixiv was launched on September 10, 2007 as a beta test. When the number of users exceeded 10,000 only nineteen days after launch, it became difficult for Kamitani to maintain Pixiv on his own, leading him to establish Crooc Inc. on October 1, 2007. The website underwent a major upgrade on December 18, 2007 into what is similar to the current version of the website. While the website was originally only available in Japanese, Chinese was the first additional language offered due to an increasing tendency of international registrants from Taiwan and China; there is also an increasing number of registrants from the United States and South Korea. In 2009, an English-language version was considered to be the lowest in terms of priority, but was later established in early 2011. Internationalization of the website continued with the addition of French, Korean, Russian and Thai. Certain European countries with a high number of hits on the website such as Germany and Italy will also be considered. The management company Crooc was renamed Pixiv Inc. on November 1, 2008. The CEO of Pixiv Inc. is Takanori Katagiri. Characteristics A free membership is required in order to browse the website. Pixiv's main concept is for users to submit their own art illustrations, which excludes most forms of photography; creative writing can also be submitted. Users can participate in a social network where one can rate contributions, leave comments on art pieces, and change tags on any entry. Due to the flexibility of tags, users can start impromptu user- generated participation events where users submit art related to a common specific subject. Each user has a personal bulletin board system where other users can leave messages. One can also respond to images with another image, known as an \\"image response\\". Pixiv differentiates itself from its most notable western counterpart, DeviantArt, in that it permits hardcore pornography to be posted on the site, albeit with genitals censored so as to conform with Japanese obscenity laws. Images such as these, or other images not suitable for children such as grotesque images, are separated from the other content through a filter which can be turned on or off via the user's profile. The majority of contributions are of anime, manga, and video game fan art, or of original art which resembles these art forms. The website's global policy includes protecting the privacy of all Pixiv users, and refraining from posting others' works, reprinting others' works without permission, and advertising for commerce. The current English slogan is \\"It's fun drawing!\\" but earlier versions used a literal translation of the Japanese slogan as \\"A place where drawing becomes more enjoyable.\\" This explains the subtitle \\"Pixiv, the online artist's community, aims to be that place.\\" =Formal events= Formal events are periodically held on Pixiv to gather participation in formal events revolving around a common theme depending on the time of year; these events revolve around the user-submitted artwork. Throughout the year, seasonal events occur, such as tie-ins with the holidays Halloween, Christmas, New Years, and Tanabata. For a fixed period of time, a section of the website is dedicated to these seasonal submissions, and aspects of the website such as the logo design and star-rating system are altered; for example, the stars are pumpkins during the Halloween-tie in event. On and thereafter the Tanabata event in mid-2008, prizes are offered by either sponsors or from Pixiv itself for participants in the event whose art proves to be popular with the community. Other than during seasonal events, sponsors can also work with Pixiv on PR events, again offering prizes to the users with the most popular works. Pixiv has held an event called \\"Doodle 4 Pixiv\\", an event inspired by Google's Doodle4Google competition where participating members take the Pixiv logo and modify it in some way. Before the Comiket 73 convention in December 2007, users set up a \\"Pixiv Edition C73 Catalog\\" on the website via the tags on the images, and following this Pixiv began setting up a section of the website for members participating at Comiket starting in preparation for Comiket 74 in August 2008. This enables users to search through a catalog by dōjin circles and by username which also includes information on where in the convention center a user's circle is located. Along the same lines, due to the high level of Touhou Project fan art contributions to the website (about 3.9% of all submissions), Pixiv also sets up a similar catalog for the annual Reitaisai Touhou convention. FeaturesTop page= When the top page of Pixiv is viewed when not logged in, a random selection of the newest highly rated contributions to the website are previewed as thumbnails. A set of tags from the most recent submissions is shown in a tag cloud under the illustrations. When logged in, six of the newest illustrations are previewed at the top, and several top-three rankings are shown including daily, popular among men, rookie, and original for illustrations, and a daily ranking for written contributions. Other rankings not on the top page include weekly, monthly, and popular among women. Tag clouds are displayed, as well as official events and new illustrations from favorited artists. A random selection of a user's favorite artists, linking to their user pages, can be viewed under the user's profile image on the left. Two links are available to a user to review their past evaluations and comments left on images. A link to go to the adult version of the top page is available as well, if enabled. =User pages= On a given user's user page, the user's three most-recent submissions are previewed as thumbnails, along with the user's three most recently bookmarked images, and the three most- recent image responses by the user who responded to another user's submissions. A selection of a user's favorite artists is available, with links to the full lists of artists divided between \\"favorite users\\" and \\"my picks\\". A short profile detailing the artist's basic information, such as nickname, birthday, sex, and location, is available, along with a short self- introduction. An additional profile detailing an artist's computer workspace is also available. Each user has a profile image used to distinguish the artist which appears above their username on their user page. Each user is given a simple, personal BBS which the user, or anyone else, can write comments on with a limit of 140 characters, and only the 60 most-recent entries are available for viewing. =Submissions= A user can submit an unlimited number of images, though a user must wait five minutes between submissions. When searching for contributions, the number of users who bookmarked a given image will appear under the thumbnail as \\"# users\\" in blue, and the number of users who gave an image response to a given image will also appear under the thumbnail as \\"# res\\" in red. If a submitted image is larger than 600x600 pixels, the image will appear as a 600-pixel length image on the image's page which, when clicked, will open up a new browser window or tab containing the full image. It is possible for a user to evaluate each submission once per 24-hour period with a scale of star-shaped icons from one to ten (low to high). The number of times an image has been evaluated, the sum score, and the number of times an image has been viewed are posted above the stars. A summary of the image written by the artist appears above the image with its title. It is possible to make a short comment on an image with a limit of 140 characters; the 20 most-recent comments are posted, and it is possible for a user to delete their own comments. A set of tags are attached to each image which can be edited by any Pixiv user, and any tag can be added, even overly specific tags containing full sentences; however, only ten tags per image are allowed. If a submission received an image response, the five most-recent image responses are previewed as thumbnails under the comment input line with a link to the full list of image responses. Previews of submissions can be embedded into other websites such as blogs which link back to the image's page on Pixiv. =Tags= Tags are an important feature of Pixiv which enable images to be grouped together in common themes and subjects. While each image is only allowed ten tags, the artist who posted a given image can choose which tags to lock or unlock; if a given tag is unlocked, any user can remove or alter the tag. Any user can add in additional tags, and it is possible to report any unpleasant or defamatory tags. A section of the website contains a list of the top 5,000 used tags on the website, with the most-used tags at the top; the two most-used tags are \\"Touhou\\" and \\"original\\" with over 1 million submissions each. Another section of the website lists the number of users who have images with common tags; for example, the \\"original\\" tag is used the most by users. There are advanced search options to search for images by size, aspect ratio, and tools used. =Favorites= It is possible to bookmark favorite images and have them easily available for viewing via a user's user page. The bookmarks are organized by tags, and a short comment on the image can be added by the bookmarker. The number of images one can bookmark is unrestricted, and the images are listed by either newest-first or oldest-first. The images bookmarked by a user are available for any user to view. A user can add other users to their \\"favorite users\\", which can either be public or private, and are listed by most-recently added. A user can add their friends as \\"my picks\\" (or \\"my Pixiv\\") which is shown in a public listing organized by the order in which the members joined Pixiv starting with the earliest. =Pixiv Premium= Launched on April 1, 2009, users can pay a fee of 525 yen per month to obtain an upgraded account known as Pixiv Premium. Users with premium accounts are given various special privileges, such as trying new services earlier than other members, sorting search results by popularity, and getting preferential treatment in the events organized through the website. Premium users are given 2,000 Pixiv Points (abbreviated pp) per month, which users give to others they like and support via a \\"goodP\\" button visible on each user's user page. It is possible to send anywhere between 10 and 500 points at a time. A third party not related to the exchange of points between two users will not be aware any points were exchanged; they are meant as a private feature between two users to show thanks or gratitude. If any points gained within any 30-day period are not used in one year's time, the points expire. There are plans to use the points to exchange them for original Pixiv goods. =Event community= Premium members can make use of the event community portion of the website which allows users to organize events off-site. Only premium users can organize the events, but any Pixiv member can view the events in a public calendar, and any member can join any of the events. All of the events are for members of Pixiv to meet offline in user-organized events to showcase art, dōjinshi, or anything else Pixiv-related. Events can only be planned up to three months in advance, and each premium member can only organize one event at a time, though can join however many one wishes. Only Pixiv-related events can be organized in the event community, and if any event which is found to be unsuitable will be removed. Up to three people can be given co-managerial status on Pixiv for an event. =Other= The search feature on the website enables a user to search for images via their tags, or by their titles and captions. A random-tag search feature is available, which excludes the adult images, where a set of forty images are displayed as thumbnails. Users can be found via a specific search feature which searches for matches with users' profiles. It is possible to message other users with a 10–10,000 character limit. A mobile phone version of the website is available called Pixiv Mobile or for short. ExhibitionsPixiv Festa= Between February 27 and March 1, 2009, Pixiv held their first convention, Pixiv Festa, at the East Design Festa Gallery in Omotesandō, Tokyo, Japan. The event consisted of several exhibitions by 145 different artists. Participants could freely interact with the art exhibits in the three ways one can interact on the website: via rating an image from one to ten (low to high) stars, making comments about an image, or having the ability to change tags on any entry. Participants were given a set of gold star-shaped stickers which they could place below any of the art pieces, showing their satisfaction or lack thereof by not placing any stars. Each of the art pieces was hung with a comment book that people could write anything they wanted in, critiquing the art pieces. Finally, participants were given a set of blank tags that they could write anything they wanted on, and attach below a given art piece; each art piece had ten spots to place tags on. Further attractions included an area where participants could draw art pieces and get feedback from others, and a \\"Pixiv Zone\\" on the second floor which contained an exhibit chronicling the -year history of Pixiv. Each participant was also given a quiz sheet regarding Pixiv trivia whose answers could be found in the Pixiv Zone. People who completed the quiz, and got at least twenty-five of thirty questions correct would receive special gifts while supplies lasted. The second Pixiv Festa convention was held in the same place between July 11–12, 2009. For the third Pixiv Festa held between June 12–13, 2010, both the East and West Design Festa Galleries were used for the convention. The fourth Pixiv Festa was held between October 16–17, 2010. =Pixiv Market= Pixiv held an event called Pixiv Market on November 15, 2009 at the Tokyo Big Sight in Ariake, Tokyo, Japan. The event was similar to Comiket where participants were able to sell and distribute their works of art, whether they were single illustrations or entire dōjinshi. The application period for Pixiv Premium members was held between July 31 and August 12, 2009, and the application period for regular Pixiv members was held between August 25 and September 10, 2009. About 200 booths were set up for the event. Additional services and media In addition to the website Pixiv, Pixiv Inc. began to develop the idea of expanding Pixiv beyond its website's boundaries while being able to use a user's Pixiv account for other peripheral services. In October 2008, Pixiv Inc. launched an oekaki Internet forum called Drawr, which anyone with a Pixiv account can use. The website uses a Flash- based system to enable users to draw art via a web application. Other users can submit art replies to any art piece; there is no interface for text entry. Unlike Pixiv, there is no search feature as there are no tags available, and it is not required to sign-up or login to Drawr to browse the entries. On Drawr, users can create threads where users submit art on a common theme, or add to the image which started the thread. In collaboration with Twitter, Pixiv Inc. launched a web service in July 2009 called DrawTwit, which anyone with a Twitter account can use and allows users to draw artwork and post them to Twitter. Others can comments on the artwork with either writing a 110-character limit or drawing a 140-brush stroke limit image response (in the same spirit as Twitter's limit of 140 characters per tweet). DrawTwit was originally a temporary service available during maintenance of the Pixiv website on July 16, 2009, but the service proved popular enough to develop into its own entity. In collaboration with Livedoor, a blogging service called Pixiv Blog was launched on April 23, 2009, which anyone with a Pixiv account can use. A Pixiv wiki called Pixiv Encyclopedia was launched on November 10, 2009 as a way to index and define the more than 1.6 million different tags used on Pixiv, which anyone with a Pixiv account can use. An English-language version of the encyclopedia and an English-language official Twitter account started in May 2011. An oekaki chat service called Pixiv Chat was launched on December 15, 2009 for users to draw oekaki art while in a chat room. In collaboration with Enterbrain, Pixiv began to produce an online magazine entitled on April 20, 2009. The magazine contains information pertaining to the Pixiv community, and useful information for its users. This includes news articles on latest Pixiv news, how-to articles, interviews with popular artists on the website, and columns, including other things. Also, the magazine covers proactive activities artists on the website are doing related to the website such as the holding of art exhibitions. Also in collaboration with Enterbrain, a magazine titled Quarterly Pixiv will begin publication on May 28, 2010 containing material similar to that in Pixiv Tsūshin. Pixiv also launched Pawoo, an instance of the decentralized open source social media network Mastodon, for its artist community. Pawoo Music, another Mastodon instance focusing on music services, was also launched. In July 2019, Pixiv announced it would shutdown Pawoo Music on August 31, and end support for Pawoo's mobile Mastodon application. The Pawoo instance would still be kept operating. = pixivFanbox = In December 2016, Pixiv launched the initial version of pixivFanbox as a service to connect creators and fans. At the time, pixivFanbox offered blog-like features to creators, allowing them to publish content through auto-renewal subscription or pay-per-article. In April 2018, pixivFanbox was reworked, opening up registration for anyone on Pixiv. Payment plans were changed into monthly subscription plans, and creators were now able to set the number of support plans and the amount to pledge. The rework was made to allow the \\"fan community to support artists and creative activities.\\" In April 2020, pixivFanbox celebrated its second anniversary, receiving its own domain name at fanbox.cc. With the update, creators were also able to set and share their own custom creator URL. ControversiesChaos Lounge= The self-styled \\"Modern Art Group\\" was suspected of collaborating with top- level management at Pixiv, though Pixiv later denied any connection to the group. Takanori Katagiri and Chaos Lounge deliberately used art solicited from a Pixiv contest in their own \\"modern art\\" collages. In these collages, visitors to the gallery were encouraged to \\"slowly trample upon\\" the images strewn out around the floor. When Pixiv users complained that their work was being used inappropriately, Pixiv took no action to punish or suspend the accounts of Chaos Lounge or Takanori Katagiri. The controversy has created a mass exodus of frustrated artists from Pixiv to alternative art-centric sites such as Tinami and Pixa. Traffic from the influx of frustrated Pixiv users has increased by as much as 50 times the normal rate for these sites, causing many of them to buckle under the weight of new users and go offline for maintenance. On July 27, 2011 Pixiv formally apologized on their website, promising to improve their management practices in the future. =Niji no Conquistador= A former member of the Japanese idol group Niji no Conquistador pressed charges against Pixiv representative director, Hiroaki Nagata, for sexual harassment during her time with the group, motivated by the Me Too movement. Nagata resigned following the lawsuit.

Early life He was born on February 26, 1869 in Ashland, Nebraska to Sarah and Andrew Marble.Marbles in the 1870 US Census in Ashland, Nebraska He later attended the University of Nebraska. He worked for a time as a linotype operator. He moved to California, and was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1903. Government career While in San Francisco, he became acquainted with City Attorney Franklin Knight Lane, and when Lane was appointed and then confirmed to the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1906, followed Lane to Washington as his confidential clerk. Marble subsequently became the Commission's attorney in charge of prosecutions, and then, in 1912, its secretary. In 1912, Marble took a leave of absence from the Commission to serve as council to the investigating committee of the Senate concerning the election of Senator William Lorimer of Illinois. Lorimer's election was shown to have been procured by bribery, and he was unseated. In 1913, Lane, by now chairman of the Commission as well as a commissioner, was appointed as Secretary of the Interior by President Woodrow Wilson. Wilson subsequently appointed Marble to the Commission in Lane's place, with Edgar Erastus Clark becoming chairman. Marble was confirmed by the Senate on March 10, 1913. As commissioner, Marble concerned himself with the Commission's prosecutions.

Early career  Troude joined the commerce navy in 1776. During the American Revolutionary War, he joined the Navy, first serving Pluton in 1779, and the next year on Hercule, both 74s. He took part in the Battle of the Saintes, and later served aboard the 28-gun frigate Crescent. Troude returned to the commerce navy, but the French revolutionary wars called him back to active duty. He served on the Achille and on the Éole. He took part in the Glorious First of June. Troude attained the rank of frigate captain on 21 March 1796Amable TROUDE and took command of the Bergère.  Battle of Algeciras  \\"Fine deed of arms by Captain Troude\\", Antoine Léon Morel-Fatio In 1799, he was transferred on the 17-gun Tyrannicide as second in command. He took part in the Battle of Algeciras on 6 July 1801, and received command of the 80-gun Formidable, whose captain, Landais Lalonde, had been killed in the action. The French fleet departed Algeciras on 12 July, with Formidable lagging behind due to the damage sustained in the previous battle. She soon found herself isolated, and chased by the frigate HMS Thames and the ships of the line HMS Venerable (74), HMS Caesar (80) and HMS Superb (74). Facing forces vastly superior combined, but at most equal taken separately, Troude let the 74-gun HMS Venerable catch on, and battered her with his 80 guns, leaving her dismasted and barely afloat. This forced the rest of the British squadron to abandon the pursuit in order to aid Venerable, allowing Formidable to escape to Cádiz. She sailed into the harbour to the acclaim of the population, who had witnessed the fight. Troude was promoted to capitaine de vaisseau on 14 July 1801 and was received by Bonaparte, who dubbed him \\"the French Horatius\\".  Later career  In 1803, Troude took command of the Infatigable, and later of the Suffren in the Caribbean. In 1805 he participated in Allemand's expedition. In March 1806, aboard the Armide, Troude helped repel an attack led by Robert Stopford at Les Sables-d'Olonne. In April 1809, he led a squadron comprising 3 ships of the line and 2 fluyts to supply French positions in the Caribbean, with his flag on Courageux. Meeting the British blockade off the Îles des Saintes on 15 April, he managed to break through but lost one of his ships of the line. Troude was promoted to contre-amiral in 1811 and given command of the flotilla based in Cherbourg. On 15 April 1814, following the Bourbon Restoration, he was tasked to ferry Louis XVIII from England to Calais, aboard the Lys. References  * H.

He is among the earliest documented Christian missionaries in India, perhaps later only than the apostle Thomas, who may have visited India in the 1st century, though sources for the period are fragmentary and sometimes confused. Sources The account of David's mission comes from an originally Syriac-language source that appears in the Arabic-language Chronicle of Seert, a history of the Nestorian Church. The Chronicle was compiled some time after the 9th century from a number of Syriac sources, and constitutes a major early source on the history of eastern Christianity. The original document was also translated by the Assyrian historian Alphonse Mingana in his Woodbrooke Studies collection of early Christian Documents in Syriac, Arabic, and Garshuni. It states that, during the patriarchate of Shahlupa and Papa, David visited and travelled throughout India, rather than settling there, and that he won converts to the Christian church. Historians have suggested that David's mission may have targeted communities in Southern India, on the assumption that an existing church there - either descended from the missionary work of the apostle Thomas, or founded by migrant Christians from elsewhere in the region - was in difficulties and required support. Mission context Some sources describe David as an Arab; others characterize him as a Persian doctor. He came from the Sassanid empire, then a young and expanding polity under the rule of Narseh. Researchers have argued that David's mission should be seen in the context of that empire's expansionist political activities. Though David's mission indicates the extension of the Persian church into India, the Seert chronicle is the only surviving reference to David's activities and there is no evidence that his mission led to the establishment of a lasting Indian church in contact with Christianity elsewhere in the region. Later evidence of a sustained Christian church on the subcontinent dates instead to at least 50 years after David's mission, with the somewhat contradictory reports of a Christian settlement on the Malabar coast led by the Syrian merchant Thomas of Cana. This settlement is dated in some sources to around 350 CE, but in others is attributed to the 8th century. Later in the 4th century, Byzantine sources attest to the dispatch, under Emperor Constantius, of one Theophilus as a missionary to India after 354. David's mission was, though, an early sign of the nascent role of the diocese of Basra as a hub of missionary activity extending into southern Asia.

It was built in a mixture of architectural styles and materials between the 13th and 18th centuries and figured heavily in the history of Hungary. The very name of Uzhhorod/Ungvár refers to the castle, translating as \\"the Uzh castle\\". The earliest stone buildings on the site of the castle may be dated to the 13th century. Charles I of Hungary gave the castle grounds to his Italian supporters from the Drugeth family. They erected a rectangular defensive structure with rhomboid bastions that recalled the castles of South Italy. The fortification, augmented in the 16th and 17th centuries, underwent numerous sieges (the last one by Francis II Rákóczi in 1703-04) but was never taken. In the 18th century, it was modernised under the supervision of Lemaire, a military engineer from France.Памятники градостроительства и архитектуры Украинской ССР. Киев: Будивельник, 1983—1986.

Encyclopaedia of Rusyn History and Culture. University of Toronto Press, 2002. . Page 515. Bercsényi, remembered as a key figure in Rákóczi's War for Independence, resided in the fortified palace within the castle. It was there that he treated with the ambassadors of Peter the Great and Louis XIV concerning the establishment of an anti-Habsburg alliance. In 1711, Bercsényi fled Hungary and his estates were confiscated to the Austrian crown. As the need for a military stronghold in the area declined with the extension of the Habsburg dominions further to the east, Ungvár Castle was given over to the Ruthenian Greek-Catholic Church which opened a school there. In 1728 and 1879, fire ravaged the castle grounds.

On an entry titled \\"The four curves of want and get,\\" Godin shows four curves representing patterns of adoption.The four curves of want and get Seth's Blog. June 24, 2005. He ends the post with \\"How do you avoid killing something too early, or celebrating too early. And last, how do you know when to kill a dud,\\" a theme that would reappear in The Dip. Five months later, Godin posted another entry titled \\"Understanding Local Max,\\" in which he presented another success curve—this time nearly identical to the one that appears in his book—and analyzed the hypothetical conversation that would occur at four points on the curve.Understanding Local Max Seth's Blog. November 9, 2005. In addition to being the basis behind The Dip, the entry was also included in Small is the new Big, a collection of short pieces from his blog. Synopsis Godin introduces the book with a quote from Vince Lombardi: \\"Quitters never win and winners never quit.\\" He follows this with \\"Bad advice. Winners quit all the time. They just quit the right stuff at the right time.\\" Godin first makes the assertion that \\"being the best in the world is seriously underrated,\\" although he defines the term 'best' as \\"best for them based on what they believe and what they know,\\" and 'world' as \\"the world they have access to.\\" He supports this by illustrating that vanilla ice cream is almost four times as popular as the next-most popular ice cream, further stating that this is seen in Zipf's Law. Godin's central thesis is that in order to be the best in the world, one must quit the wrong stuff and stick with the right stuff. In illustrating this, Godin introduces several curves: 'the dip,' 'the cul-de-sac,' and 'the cliff.'Images from the book The Dip Blog. May 20, 2007. Godin gives examples of the dip, ways to recognize when an apparent dip is really a cul-de-sac, and presents strategies of when to quit, amongst other things. The book is also accompanied with cartoons from Hugh MacLeod, who publishes his cartoons on his blog gapingvoid and is the author of \\"How To Be Creative.\\"gapingvoid cartoons drawn on the back of business cardsMacLeod, Hugh How To Be Creative gapingvoid. Release and Reception In early March, Godin launched a companion blog to The Dip titled \\"The Dip Blog,\\" in which he released details about the book and gave illustrative examples.The Dip Blog On his subsequent book tour, Godin agreed to go to any place where people had bought 2,500 copies of his book.Windley, Phil Seth Godin: The Dip Godin made stops in 15 cities, totaling 37,500 books. The Dip peaked at #5 on the New York Times Best Seller List and sold 100,000 copies in its first month of release.10 Questions with Seth Godin Bestseller Interviews. June 8, 2007.

Miller (c. 1851 – November 7, 1881) was an American gambler, confidence man and swindler. He was popularly known as \\"King of the Bunco Men\\", at times sharing that title with fellow tricksters Tom O'Brien and Joseph \\"Hungry Joe\\" Lewis, and ran one of the largest banco operations in the United States during the late 19th century.Hyde, Stephen and Geno Zanetti, ed.

(pg. 179-180) BiographyEarly life and criminal career= Charles Miller was born to a county officer in Texas around 1851. Growing up during Reconstruction, he was said to be an unruly child due to \\"parental indulgence\\". By age 15, he had begun drinking heavily and had reportedly \\"fallen into bad company with both sexes\\". He was eventually disowned by his father and began \\"riding the rails\\" until arriving in New Orleans, Louisiana. Miller began working as a \\"capper\\" for Major S.A. Doran at his Royal Street gambling house and while there began learning confidence tricks and banco steering.Walling, George W. Recollections of a New York Chief of Police: An Official Record of Thirty-eight Years as Patrolman, Detective, Captain, Inspector and Chief of the New York Police. New York: Caxton Book Concern, 1887. (pg. 359-361) When he had saved $35,000, he moved to New York City and opened a small gambling den which later became known as a notorious \\"skinning dive\\" in the city's underworld. Within a few years, Miller had organized a group con men who worked as banco-steerers and green goods men out of the Astor House and the Fifth Avenue Hotel. Miller became a familiar underworld figure and, according to popular lore, he kept his headquarters at \\"a lamp-post on the southwest corner of Broadway and Twenty-Eighth Street, against which he could generally be found leaning\\". Miller had originally arrived in New York and joined a \\"gambling clique\\" which had helped him in starting his gambling den. Once he had learned enough from them, he took another more knowledgeable partner and soon began competing with such leading swindlers as Joseph \\"Hungry Joe\\" Lewis and McDermott. Miller possessed a great deal of loyalty from his henchmen and, by directing his schemes though them, criminal prosecution against him was made extremely difficult. He also held a great deal of influence in the city legal system, due to his extensive police and political connections, which allowed considerable power to \\"pull the strings of the law when ever he so chose\\". He was especially well known in the affluent communities of Long Branch, Nantasket Beach, Richfield Springs and other resorts frequented by New York high society. It was at these and similar areas that he directed his organization in swindling the wealthy residents. Miller spent at least half the year in high-class barrooms, restaurants and hotels, while he operated his organization during the summer. Although he is thought to have amassed at least several hundred thousand dollars in his lifetime, he spent much of his fortune living an extravagant lifestyle. He also incurred heavy gambling losses, especially on horse racing where he lost $20,000 in one day, and gave up playing faro when he lost $18,000 in one sitting at a Saratoga gambling resort. =Death= In the spring of 1881, Miller became involved in a violent feud with saloon keeper and burglar Billy Tracy. The dispute between the two men came to a head one night when Miller visited Tracy's saloon on West Twenty-Ninth Street. Tracy began to bully him once Miller entered the saloon but backed down when Miller indicated he would retaliate. Later when Tracy approached from behind, in which he was alleged to have shouted \\"I'll fix you!\\", Miller turned and fired his pistol at him. Miller fired three shots, one of which only slightly grazed Tracy, and the saloon keeper fell to the floor and began calling for the police. Miller's friends gathered around Tracy in a crowd and began laughing at him before eventually leaving. No arrests were made, however Tracy vowed to get revenge for his embarrassment. At around midnight on November 7, 1881, Miller was drinking at Dick Darling's Broadway saloon with several of his friends including Bill Bowie, George Law Jr., Harry Rice, Charles Crawford and Billy Temple. After an hour, Tracy was seen peeking into the saloon from the front entrance. A few minutes later, he reentered the saloon and walked up to the bar to order a whiskey sour. He then turned to Miller and said \\"I came in here to kill you\\" before drawing a revolver and pointing it at his head before shooting him in the stomach. Miller reached for his pistol but collapsed onto the floor. Miller was taken by ambulance to the New York Hospital where he died from his wounds shortly after his arrival. Tracy was arrested and tried for his murder, however he was found not guilty due to perjured testimony and returned to running his saloon. ReferencesFurther reading *Asbury, Herbert.

The protagonist of the story, which is set in Finnish Lapland around 1950, is a man by the name of Gunnar Huttunen, who settles in a small village to mend and run a derelict mill. Huttunen is an enterprising and resourceful man, a hard worker, proudly independent but generally good-natured. However, his peculiar personality, particularly his habit of howling to vent his emotions, turns the intolerant villagers and authorities against him, and he is eventually committed into a mental hospital. After escaping, Huttunen lives as a fugitive in the wilderness, aided by his few friends: his lover Sanelma, the local police constable Portimo, and the postman and moonshiner Piittisjärvi. After a final confrontation with the law, Huttunen disappears, never to be heard from again. The book has been translated into several languages. It has twice been adapted into a feature film: a Finnish one called Ulvova mylläri (1982) and a French one, Cornélius, le meunier hurlant (2017). NotesReferences * Arto Paasilinna, Will Hobson (tr.).

History He was trained by Keith Murray, a New Zealand-born ceramic designer, while at Wedgwood in England. He developed into a skilled thrower and was a key interpreter of Murray's designs. In 1948 Shufflebotham was brought to New Zealand by Crown Lynn along with a number of other designers including Frank Carpay to work in the company's 'Specials Department'. He was employed to produce more upmarket works that would expand the market for Crown Lynn ceramics. He was one of the few professional throwers in New Zealand during the period from his arrival in 1948 to his departure in 1957. He continued the style used by Murray and would throw the clay on a pottery wheel to create the vase. His assistant would then turn it on a lathe to produce the indentations. The matt white finish of his work was made possible by Crown Lynn's 1948 development of a formula based on halloysitic clay from Matauri Bay. These works were variations on those he had thrown at Wedgwood. His work has influenced New Zealand potters, in particular the potter John Parker.

Ross, an American diplomat, was the Director of Policy Planning in the State Department under President George H. W. Bush and the special Middle East coordinator under President Bill Clinton. Summary After beginning with an anecdote of Yasser Arafat coming to see President Clinton just days before the end of Clinton's second term in office, Ross returns to the period of the British Mandate and continues through the 1980s, giving a brief history of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and its roots. His own involvement begins in the run-up to the Gulf War and the 1991 Madrid Conference. The book then covers the negotiations between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, as well as the emergence of the 1993 Oslo Accords. Ross then moves on to the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty, the 1995 Interim Agreement, and the November 1995 assassination of Yitzhak Rabin. He proceeds to the diplomatic fallout from the assassination to the election of Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister, followed by several chapters dedicated to the negotiations on the 1997 Hebron Agreement. One year later, Netanyahu and Arafat agreed on the Wye River Memorandum. In 1998 Ehud Barak succeeded Netanyahu as prime minister and placed a priority on negotiations with Syria. After recounting the fall of that deal, Ross moves on to the 2000 Camp David Summit, and from that to the outbreak of the second intifada and the Taba Summit in January 2001. Reception A New York Times review by Ethan Bronner called it an \\"important, voluminous and keenly balanced memoir,\\" though \\"as important as this work is to history. ... It is overly long and frequently dull.\\" Samuel W. Lewis reviewed the book for Foreign Affairs, praised it as \\"a major contribution to the diplomatic history of the twentieth century\\" that described the Arab–Israeli negotiations in \\"exquisite detail\\", but added that it was not a page-turner. In The Washington Post, Glenn Frankel found the history \\"an epic and tragic tale\\" that offered revealing profiles of a multitude of Arab and Israeli leaders. Both exhaustive and exhausting, Frankel stated that the book \\"sometimes reads like a working manual for diplomats.\\" The Economist, while also warning that it was not light reading and that it inevitably contained an unhappy ending, concluded that \\"Mr Ross's [book] is the one for the historians.\\" Commentary published a critical review by Hillel Halkin remarking, \\"[i]t is possible not to see the forest for the trees. It is even possible, by seeing only the trees, to forget that the forest exists. This is true of Dennis Ross's The Missing Peace.\\"Halkin, Hillel. \\"The Missing Peace by Dennis Ross\\". Commentary. September 2004. The Nation called the book a \\"comprehensive and fascinating memoir\\" but also stated that \\"The Missing Peace raises serious questions about the soundness of the Israel-first school of which Dennis Ross is a prominent member.\\"Shlaim, Avi. \\"The Lost Steps\\". The Nation. August 30, 2004. Former professor Norman G. Finkelstein wrote a rebuttal to The Missing Peace in the Journal of Palestine Studies. He stated that \\"where Ross's allegedly verbatim account of the actual negotiations can be crosschecked, it proves misleading\\". He also argued that \\"Israeli needs, in Ross's calculus, systematically trump Palestinian rights\\" and that Ross engaged in a \\"wholesale dismissal of Palestinian needs\\".The Camp David II Negotiations: How Dennis Ross Proved the Palestinians Aborted the Peace Process.

Life The eldest of four sons of William Holl the Elder (c.1771-1838), he was taught engraving by his father – at first stipple and later line on steel. The first portrait engraving produced on his own was that of Thomas Cranmer in May 1829 for inclusion in Edmund Lodge's Portraits of Illustrious Personages. He contributed further work to this publication between 1829 and 1835 after artists such as van Loo, Holbein, Van Dyck, Lely, Godfrey Kneller and Daniel Mytens. He was a founder member of the Chalcographic Society started by several notable engravers in 1830. Holl also produced portraits for William Jerdan's National Portrait Gallery (1830-34) and for the 1834 Chambers's Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen. Working with his brother Francis Holl (1815-84), he provided engraved illustrations to Finden's 1837 Tableaux of National Character and Gallery of Beauty of 1841 and to the 1840 edition of The Land of Burns. The third brother Charles Holl (c.1810-1882) aided William throughout his career. The youngest brother Benjamin (1808–1884) also achieved notable success as a portrait and figure engraver and later emigrated to the US. In the 1840s his major works were engravings after William Powell Frith, illustrating the poems of Thomas Moore \\"Beauties of Moore\\" (1840) and scriptural engravings after various artists such as Raphael, Rembrandt, Benjamin West and James Northcote for inclusion in Blackie & Sons' Imperial Family Bible (1844) and John Kitto's Gallery of Scripture Engravings (1846–49). He also produced portraits for the Imperial Dictionary (1861) and Thomas Baines's Yorkshire Past and Present (1871–77).

During her long career she saw service in the American War of Independence, the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. She captured a number of enemy privateers and served in the East and West Indies, the Mediterranean and British and American waters. Construction and commissioning Eurydice was ordered from Portsmouth Dockyard on 24 July 1776, and was laid down in February 1777. She was initially worked on by Master Shipwright Nicholas Phillips until April 1779, and then by George White. She was launched on 26 March 1781 and completed for service on 3 June 1781. She had cost £12,391.4.0d to build, this sum including fitting and coppering. She was commissioned under her first captain, George Wilson, in March 1781. CareerAmerican War of Independence= Wilson sailed initially to the Leeward Islands, arriving in Frigate Bay, St Kitts on either 25 or 26 January 1782. Eurydice was present at the Battle of the Saintes on 12 April 1782, and then returned to Britain carrying the dispatches. She came under the command of Captain George Courtnay in April 1782, under whom she served in the English Channel and off the Channel Islands. She joined John Elliot’s squadron in Autumn 1782 and on 14 October 1782 she captured the French Amis off Île de Batz. Eurydice was paid off between 1782 and 1783 but recommissioned in April 1783. An 18-year-old Fletcher Christian, later to be the instigator of the mutiny on the Bounty,Mutiny on the HMS Bounty: Bligh, Christian, Pitcairn, Norfolk signed on aboard HMS Eurydice on 25 April 1783 at Spithead. She was the first Royal Navy ship that Christian signed on to. Eurydice's next posting was to the East Indies, to which she sailed on 10 April 1783. On 24 May 1784, in Madras, Christian was promoted to Acting Lieutenant and Watch Leader. Eurydice returned to Britain and was again paid off in July 1785, and spent between January and April 1786 undergoing a Small Repair at Woolwich Dockyard at a cost of £2,290. She was fitted for sea at Woolwich at a cost of £3,386 between May and July 1788, during which she was recommissioned in June 1788 under Captain George Lumsdaine. =French Revolutionary Wars= Lumsdaine sailed for service in the Mediterranean on 27 November 1788. With war with Revolutionary France looming she was fitted out by Wells & Co for £1,856 between February and March 1793, and then at Woolwich for a further £3,507 between March and June 1793. Eurydice was then recommissioned under Captain Francis Cole in April 1793. On 8 June 1794, Eurydice, along with the 36-gun Crescent, the 32-gun Druid and six smaller vessels, all under the command of Sir James Saumarez were sent from Plymouth to reconnoitre the French coast. Off the north-west coast of Guernsey they encountered the two 50-gun French razees – Scévola and Brutus – the two 36-gun frigates Danaé and Félicité, and a 14-gun brig. Saumarez ordered Eurydice, his slowest ship, into port to avoid her capture and then lured the French ships into range of Guernsey's shore-based guns. He then turned across the line of the French ships and through a narrow passage between the rocks, which enabled him to escape. A memorial plaque at Castle Cornet in St. Peter Port, Guernsey, depicts the encounter.Admiral Saumarez Eurydice came under the command of Captain Thomas Twysden in 1795, with Twysden being succeeded by Captain Richard Bennet in 1796. During this time she operated on convoy and cruising duties. Harsh treatment of the crew led to considerable unhappiness aboard the ship. On 24 April the crew unanimously put their names to a petition to Admiralty, accusing the First Lieutenant and the master's mate of conduct \\"so tyrannical that such officers are a disgrace to the service.\\"Petition, HMS Eurydice, 1796. Cited in Lavery (ed.) 1998, p. 425 Admiralty convened a court martial to try the sailor suspected of drafting the petition, but he was acquitted as there was insufficient evidence that it was in his handwriting. No charges were laid against the officers of the ship, but Captain Bennett was removed from his command and the ship placed in ordinary until a replacement was found.Lavery (ed.) 1998, p. 420 =Return to service= Eurydice was recommissioned in August 1796 under Captain John Talbot and was deployed in the North Sea. She captured the French privateer Sphinx on 15 December 1796, the 14-gun Flibustier on 6 February 1797 and Voligeur on 7 March. The next day she was in sight, as were and hired armed cutter Grace, when captured the galiot Concordia. On the morning of 10 November 1799 Eurydice was some 9 miles south- east of Beachy Head, when she sighted a schooner and a brig. The schooner made off as soon as she saw the ship and the brig hove to and hoisted her ensign upside down. She reported that she had been attacked by the schooner and that one of her men was badly wounded. Talbot sent his surgeon, Mr Price, on board the brig and made sail after the privateer. The sloop joined in the chase later in the morning. Halfway through the afternoon Eurydice came nearly within gunshot of the privateer which bore up and tried to cross Snake. When this manoeuvre failed, the vessel lowered her sails and surrendered. She was the Hirondelle of Calais, commanded by Pierre Merie Dugerdin with a crew of 50 men, one of whom was found to be an Englishman. She was armed with fourteen 3 and 4-pounders and had sailed on the Saturday morning. The brig Eurydice had recaptured was the collier Diana, from Sunderland bound for Portsmouth. Her wounded man was brought on board Eurydice where the surgeon had to remove an arm. On 29 April 1800 the gun-vessel recaptured the brig Adventure, of London, while Eurydice and were in sight. Eurydice was refitted at Portsmouth and in January 1801 came under the command of Captain Walter Bathurst. Bathurst captured the privateer Bougainville, of Saint Malo, in the Atlantic on 8 May 1801. She was under the command of Jaques le Bon, had a crew of 67 men, and was armed with 14 guns of different calibre. She was out three days and had made no captures. Eurydice sailed for the East Indies on 20 October 1801. After her return to Britain she was refitted in 1803, and commissioned in September 1803 under Captain John Nicholas. Under Nicolas she escorted a convoy to Quebec, departing Britain on 16 May 1804. Napoleonic Wars Captain William Hoste took command in November 1804, and Eurydice served under him in the Mediterranean throughout 1805. On 14 November 1804 Eurydice was in company with when they recaptured the hired armed ship Lord Eldon and sent her into Gibraltar. Spanish gunboats had captured her off Algeciras two days earlier. Eurydice shared with and Prevoyante in the proceeds from the capture on 11 June 1805 of the Prussian ship Edward. The proceeds were forwarded from Gibraltar. Eurydice captured the 6-gun privateer Mestuo La Solidade on 6 October, before passing under the command of Captain Sir William Bolton in December that year. Eurydice spent 1806 and 1807 in the Channel, before acting-Captain David Ramsey took over in August 1808. She was later under Captain James Bradshaw and was present at the capture of Martinique in February 1809. In 1847 the Admiralty authorised the clasp \\"Martinique\\" to the Naval General Service Medal to all surviving participants in that campaign. Eurydice spent 1809 to 1811 on the North American Station, undertaking a number of cruises out of Halifax, Nova Scotia in company with the ships at the station. She then returned to Britain and spent 1812 to 1814 in ordinary at Deptford. She underwent a temporary repair at Deptford between September 1813 and June 1814; and was subsequently fitted for sea there between August and October 1814. Post-war and fate Eurydice was recommissioned in August 1814 under Captain Valentine Gardner and by June 1815 was under Captain Robert Spencer and serving on the Irish Station. Her final seagoing service was off St Helena under Captain Robert Wauchope, who took command in April 1816. In February 1818 the merchantman , Joseph Short, master, was sailing from Dundee when she encountered a Portuguese brig with 360 slaves from Mozambique. Atlas sent the brig into the Cape of Good Hope where Eurydice detained the brig.Lloyd's List, 15 May 1818, №5280. On 8 January 1819, two seamen on behaved in a mutinous manner as she transported convicts from England to Van Diemen's Land. The rest of the crew objected to the men being put in irons, but eventually all but two others returned to their duties. When Hibernia reached Rio de Janeiro, Lennon asked Captain Wauchope for assistance. Eventually 12 men from Hibernia joined Eurydices crew; Wauchope sent only three men in return. The resulting crew shortage on Hibernia delayed her sailing.Text of a deposition by Lennon and his officers to the British Consul General at Rio. Eurydice was laid up at Deptford in December 1819 but moved in 1821 to Woolwich. She was fitted as a receiving ship there between August 1823 and January 1824, spending the rest of her career in this role. She was finally broken up at Deptford in March 1834.

Both Biggs and his brother Norman played international rugby for Wales, though they never played in the same match for Wales together. Biggs was described at the time as a 'certain tackler' and a 'fast, good dodger'.Alcock (1997) Biggs also played cricket for Glamorgan and was part of the team to face the touring South Africans in 1895. Rugby career Biggs followed his brother Norman when he joined Cardiff Rugby Club, the team he would represent throughout his international career. He joined Cardiff during the 1889/90 season and the next year he was made captain of the club's reserve team.Davies (1975) pp.211-213 In 1894 he was selected to play for the invitational touring side Barbarian F.C., facing Rockcliff on 2 April. He was first selected to represent Wales in the opening game of the 1895 Home Nations Championship, the very next international after his brother represented Wales for the final time. Biggs was partnered in the half-back role with Llanelli's Ben Davies, himself a new cap; and the first of six partners he would be paired with over his nine match career. His first international was against England in a game played at St. Helens in Swansea. Under the captaincy of Wales rugby superstar Arthur 'Monkey' Gould, Wales lost 3–7, with the English forwards outplaying their Welsh counterparts in the loose.Griffiths (1987), pg 4:7. The selectors kept faith with Biggs for the next game of the Championship, away to Scotland, but switched Davies for the more experienced Fred Parfitt. Wales lost this game too, again the forwards could not contend with the opposing side and Biggs and Parfitt were replaced by Morgan of Llanelli and Sweet-Escott of Cardiff in the final game of the tournament. The 1896 Championship witnessed a change in direction for the Welsh team, with a massive upheaval in the team selection. The selectors chose a new pairing at half-back for the first game against England, but the blame again fell on the forwards, with the English winning by a massive 25 points to nil. Biggs and Parfitt were brought back into the squad for the second game, but more importantly five new caps made their debut in the pack. The Scottish lost 6–0 against Wales at Cardiff, which was seen as an upset by the inexperienced Welsh.Griffiths (1987), pg 4:8. Biggs missed the final game against Ireland and his replacement, Llewellyn Lloyd, had a torrid time trying to defend the Irish attacks. Biggs started the 1896/97 season with Cardiff by being made club vice-captain under Jack Elliott.Davies (1975) p.210 Biggs finished 1896 by being invited to play in his second Barbarian match, this time against a select West of England team. The 1897 Championship saw Wales play just one match, after the Welsh Rugby Union withdrew Wales from international competition due to the Gould Affair, but Biggs was reselected for that match. His pairing for this game, against England, was Aberavon's Dan Jones who scored a try in a rare victory over the English. When Wales were readmitted to the tournament the next year, Biggs was given a new partner for both games, his Cardiff team-mate Jack Elliott. Wales won the Ireland game at Limerick but lost to England at Blackheath. During the 1897/98 season Biggs was made captain of Cardiff, following his brother Norman, who has also held the position four years earlier. 1898 saw Biggs captain the Cardiff team twice against the invitational touring team the Barbarians.Starmer-Smith, Nigel The Barbarians; Futura Publications Ltd. (1977) pg.77 Cardiff won both matches with Viv Huzzey scoring two tries, four conversions and a dropped goal in the second game. 1898 also saw Biggs play his final game for the Barbarians, facing Exeter on 27 December. At international level Biggs was dropped once more, when the charismatic James Brothers were reselected over him for the England game during the 1899 Championship. England were beaten convincingly, but the James brothers both turned professional shortly afterwards, making themselves ineligible for further appearances under the rugby union code. The selectors brought Lloyd back into the squad to partner Biggs in the final two games of the tournament, losses to Scotland and Ireland. Biggs played one final international game, as part of the 1900 Home Nations Championship. Wales had already won the first two games over England and Scotland with the half- back pairing of Lloyd and Phillips. Biggs replaced Lloyd for the away match against Ireland, and a Welsh victory gave Wales the tournament. Biggs, like his brother in 1893, was now part of a Triple Crown winning team. In 1904, Biggs was one of twenty sporting stars of rugby and football to be chosen on a series of collectable cards issued with Cadle's cigarettes.Cadle's cigatette cards – ovalballs.com =International matches played= WalesSmith (1980), pg 463. * 1895, 1897, 1898 * 1898, 1899, 1900 * 1895, 1896, 1899 Cricket career Biggs played for several Welsh cricket clubs, mainly for Glamorgan but turned out for Cardiff and South Wales. He was a medium pace bowler, turning out for Glamorgan in the Minor Counties Cricket Championship between 1896 and 1899. On 22 June 1894, Biggs was part of the Glamorgan team to face the touring South African cricket team at the Cardiff Arms Park. Biggs played alongside fellow rugby internationals Billy Bancroft and Ralph Sweet-Escott. Glamorgan lost by ten wickets, with Biggs taking two wickets, including Frank Hearne, for 76 runs in 24 overs.

Life and times Jaime Yankelevich was born into a Jewish family in Bulgaria, in 1896. His parents emigrated to Argentina in 1899 and settled in the province of Entre Ríos. The Yankelevich family relocated to Buenos Aires in 1914, where Jaime found work in one of the city's many theatres as a backstage hand. Trained as a theatre electrician, Yankelevich eventually opened an electrical supply store in the Constitución section of Buenos Aires. The store specialized in radio valves and other equipment, which became in great demand following the advent of the medium in 1920. Increasingly skilled in his field, he created many of these parts by hand.Caras The sale of a failing early radio station gave Yankelevich the opportunity to pursue his interest directly and in 1924, he purchased the ailing broadcaster. Known at the time as \\"LR3\\" (for its being the third station on the dial), Yankelevich pioneered the use of artistic contracts in radio, by which artists were paid a salary in return for his commitment to limit broadcasts of their work to live performances in lieu of recordings. The practice made the newly christened \\"Radio Belgrano\\" the most coveted employer in Argentine radio and by the 1930s, it enjoyed the nation's highest ratings. Growing acquisitions allowed Yankelevich to form the Radio Belgrano chain in 1937.Argentine Radio: Over 60 years on the air. The Argentine Information Secretariat, 1981. Venturing into other areas, he co-produced Two Friends and One Love, a 1937 romantic comedy film, with Francisco Canaro, a well-known Argentine tango bandleader.Cine Nacional Later that decade, he pioneered late-night broadcasting in Argentina, and in 1942, united numerous low-wattage radio stations into the Argentine Broadcasting Chain, which preserved or reopened a number of smaller, local stations nationwide.La Rioja Cultural The 1946 election of President Juan Perón resulted in the nationalization of industries producing nearly half the nation's goods and services, including the three radio networks that controlled most of Argentina's stations, El Mundo, Splendid and Belgrano.Comité Federal de Radiodifusión Yankelevich had opposed the 1943 coup d'état, and the advent of one of its most recognizable figures (Perón) to the Presidency antagonized the impresario. Allowing critical commentary of Perón's inaugural address following the event, Radio Belgrano was suspended by government order for one month. The experience persuaded Yankelevich to sell Radio Belgrano to the state for US$1.5 million in 1947. The chain's management was left to Yankelevich, who continued to receive the greater part of the chain's net income (Argentine radio's most profitable), and in turn, the Perón regime dictated content and vetted personnel and performers. A personal tragedy motivated Yankelevich to pioneer another, then-inexistent medium in Argentina. The death in 1949 of his son Miguel, who professed fascination with the growth of television in the United States, led the grieving father to purchase the necessary equipment for its introduction in Argentina. Discussing the authorization for the project with Perón's Communications Minister, Oscar Nicolini, Yankelevich persuaded the reluctant bureaucrat by positing that: One of the DuMont cameras imported by Yankelevich > The money needed to invest in this project does not concern me, for no > amount of millions would be too much! Albores de la televisión Argentina Importing DuMont television cameras and ITT transmitters, he and engineers James Ballantine, Máximo Koeble and Alejandro Spataro prepared the downtown studio and installed a antenna over the 23-story Ministry of Public Works (then Buenos Aires' second-tallest building). Personally operating the antenna, Yankelevich and his team achieved the nation's first television broadcast in 1951, reaching 40 blocks around. Emitting programs through the only TV station in Argentina at the time (Channel 7), all programming on the station was produced by Radio Belgrano Televisión, providing Yankelevich a similarly profitable relationship with the state as the one his radio chain had enjoyed since 1947. Yankelevich's failing health led to his hospitalization a few months later, and he died in 1952 at the age of 56. Among the items in his hospital room, was a television set.

Tim Dry (born 9 January 1952) is a mime artist, writer, photographic artist, musician and actor, best known for appearing in Return of the Jedi and the cult sci-fi/horror film Xtro. Tim was a member of the duo Tik and Tok, that popularised robotic mime in the UK in the 1980s. Early years Tim Dry was born in Redhill, Surrey, in 1952. After leaving a Graphic Design Dip AD course at Reigate School of Art and Design in 1972, he moved to Brighton, Sussex to explore other areas of creativity, including painting, fine art and producing, along with other Reigate Art School alumni, The Cosmic Colouring Book which was published to acclaim in 1973. In 1976, he relocated to London to train in mime and physical theatre with Desmond Jones and Lindsay Kemp (who tutored Kate Bush and David Bowie, amongst others). The-eighties After three years of intensive stage work (both in solo and duo shows, and as a member of Jones' company 'Silents') Tim, alongside fellow mime partner Barbie Wilde, formed SHOCK: a rock/mime/burlesque/music troupe with Robert Pereno, Carole Caplin, LA Richards and Sean Crawford. SHOCK performed extensively in the burgeoning New Romantic club scene in London in the early 1980s. The first SHOCK single on RCA Records, 'Angel Face', (co-produced by Rusty Egan from Visage and Richard James Burgess from Landscape) was a modest dance floor hit in clubs all over the UK and in New York. SHOCK continued to play at the Blitz Club, The Venue, the Playboy Club, The Embassy Club, The Lyceum, and 'The People's Palace' performance at the Rainbow Theatre. They supported Gary Numan for three nights at his 'Farewell' concerts at Wembley Arena in April 1981. Reduced to a four-piece ensemble after the abrupt departure of Robert and LA in June 1981, SHOCK released a second single, 'Dynamo Beat', on RCA, which again was a dance floor hit in UK clubs, but failed to chart nationwide. Tik and Tok In early 1982 Tim and Sean left Shock to pursue their own vision of a combination of mime, visual image and music, creating a duo called Tik and Tok. Signed to Indie label Survival Records, they released 5 singles and an album 'Intolerance' in the UK, Europe and Japan. Their second single 'Cool Running' reached No.69 in the UK Top 70 Singles Chart (The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles). In 1982, Tik and Tok were cast as featured creatures in two roles each in Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. The same year also saw them appear in the cult sci- fi/horror film Xtro. Tim played The Monster and Sean played The Commando. Tik and Tok supported Duran Duran on their sell-out UK tour of 1982 and Gary Numan on his comeback UK 'Warriors' tour in 1983. They appeared on 23 TV shows, including The Royal Variety Performance in front of HRH Queen Elizabeth II and the cult music program The Tube, hosted by Jools Holland and Paula Yates. Tik & Tok reformed briefly in 2005, creating a new album, Dream Orphans, in which Tim wrote, played and produced all the songs. Tim and Sean appear regularly at 'Star Wars' autograph conventions worldwide.

The river was named by Governor James Stirling, probably after Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren under whom Stirling served whilst in action in North America in 1813. History The river was first encountered in 1831 by Lieutenant William Preston RN, first of the Success, then of the Sulphur. Preston was in charge of a boat survey of the south-west coast from Albany to Fremantle. The boat was wrecked near Green Point and Preston and his crew were forced to make the first land journey from Albany to Fremantle, along the coast. Preston was a brother-in-law of Governor Stirling. The first settler on the Warren was Edward Reveley Brockman, who in 1862, established Warren House homestead and station on the banks of the river. Geography The river rises in the Tone State Forest west of Strachan, south-east of Manjimup. From the confluence of the Tone and Perup Rivers (at Murtinup) it flows in a south-westerly direction crossing the South Western Highway and then through the Warren State Forest, the Greater Hawke and D'Entrecasteaux National Parks and the Dombakup Nature Reserve, finally discharging into the Southern Ocean near Coolyarbup. The Warren is a medium-sized river originating in medium rainfall marri/wandoo woodlands, flowing through jarrah/marri forest and high rainfall karri country to the coast. It is the second largest river by streamflow in the Busselton- Walpole region. Tributaries of the Warren River include the Perup, Yerraminnup, Wilgarup and Tone rivers, and Quinninup, Lefroy and Dombakup brooks. Salinity Prior to vegetation clearing for agriculture, salinity was recorded as approximately 120–350 mg/L, where <500 mg/L is considered fresh. The Wilgarup, Dombakup and Lefroy sub-catchments were initially cleared around 1925 as part of the Group Settlement Scheme. Extensive clearing in the 1950s and 1960s resulted in a significant increase in stream salinity, with water quality no longer considered fresh. The Warren catchment was declared a clearing control catchment in 1978 following concerns with rising salinity levels. Following this declaration, intensive revegetation was undertaken within the Perup and Tone River sub-catchments, which account for 60% of the salt load entering the Warren River. Salinity levels are leveling off and clearing within the total catchment is now estimated as 35%. The lower Warren River to the river mouth is considered slightly brackish, with a mean annual salinity of 990 mg/l for the period 1993-2002, measured at Barker Road gauging station. Dombakup Brook is recorded as being fresh (< 440 mg/l).

Whiting. It is the film version of the stage show based on the comic strip Jane originally created by Norman Pett. It was written by Alfred Goulding and Con West. The cast included Chrystabel Leighton-Porter, who played Jane, and Michael Hogarth, who played Tom Hawke. It was filmed in Brighton, East Sussex, England. Plot On the last night of her act at the Gaiety Theatre, Jane meets Snade, her supposed fan. He gives her a diamond bracelet, saying it is a \\"token of his appreciation.\\" Jane, unsuspecting, gladly accepts his gift. Later that evening, she is visited by Tom, an old friend. She tells him that she is judging a beauty contest at the Tudor Close Hotel in Brighton. He agrees to join her. The next morning at the railway station Jane has one of her iconic wardrobe malfunctions and is left in only her underwear. She is rescued by Captain Cleaver (who, unknown to Jane, is the leader of a gang of diamond smugglers) who lends her his coat. Before the beauty contest, Tom takes Jane to dinner. There, he tells her that he is on a 'special job' in Brighton and is after a gang of diamond smugglers. He also tells her that her bracelet is only paste. Tom becomes increasingly jealous of Cleaver during the evening, and is angry when Jane agrees to go on a date with Cleaver on his Yacht. The next morning, Cleaver discreetly exchanges the central diamond in the bracelet for one his friends have smuggled into England. So when Jane goes through customs, the diamond is not suspected. Afterwards, he tries to steal it back, but failing to do so, he and his friends decide that they must kidnap both Jane and the bracelet. They lure Jane and Fritz to a remote cottage. But, unknown to the gang, Jane had already given the bracelet to Ruby, Cleaver's long-suffering girlfriend. After putting an SOS in Fritz's collar, Jane smuggles him out and tells him to go back to the inn and to get help. Back at the inn, Tom discovers one of the spivs searching Jane's room for the bracelet, but gets knocked out by the criminal before he can raise the alarm. Meanwhile, Snade sees Ruby wearing the diamonds. He snatches them and makes his way to Cleaver's cottage. Realising that the police are on their track, Cleaver and his gang clear out of the cottage, taking Jane with them, but they throw her out of the car soon afterwards. Snade who is also being chased by the police, decides to destroy the evidence and throws the bracelet out of the car window. Jane, who is composing herself at the bottom of the embankment where she had been thrown has the diamond bracelet fall (literally) into her lap. Cleaver, Snade and the rest of the gang continue to be chased until they are cornered by the police. Cast *Chrystabel Leighton-Porter as Jane Gay *Fritz as himself *Michael Hogarth as Tom Hawke *Ian Colin as Captain Cleaver *Sonya O'Shea as Ruby *Edward Stanelli as the Hotel Manager *Wally Patch as the Customs Official *Peter Butterworth as the Drunken Man *Norman Pett as himself Production The Adventures of Jane was shot entirely in Brighton and the surrounding countryside. In the beginning credits, Chrystabel Leighton-Porter poses for Norman Pett for a drawing entitled Jane in the Navy. Although Leighton-Porter starred in the film, she was not credited. It simply said: \\"starring Jane and Fritz.\\" The reason for this is unknown (Leighton- Porter was credited in the brochure released by Eros Films), but possibly it was due to the fact that to many people, Jane's character was almost a real person; her daily misadventures had comforted and raised their spirits during the horrors of World War Two. The film had an extremely low budget, even recruiting Leighton-Porter's husband Arthur to be an extra. Chrystabel Leighton-Porter later said: \\"It really was simply awful. I was no film actress, and the feeble plot and script didn't help much either!\\"  DVD release  The Adventures Of Jane was released on a 2-in-1 disc with Murder at 3am in 2008, region 2 format. Other adaptations of Jane There has been several other screen adaptations of the comic character 'Jane'. In 1987, Kirsten Hughes starred in the film Jane and the Lost City. Also in the 1980s, was a BBC TV series was made starring Glynis Barber as Jane. Chrystabel Leighton-Porter who starred in The Adventures of Jane also appeared in the striptease act as Jane.

It is endemic to Brazil and Puerto Rico. The oiticica grows deep in floods of rivers and streams, forming long, narrow avenues to the edge of ravines or floodplains staining the dark-green color of its large and dense foliage. Gallery Oiticica.jpg Oiticica no Boqueirão.jpg Licania rigida fruits.jpg Description Licania rigida is generally considered a tree, and can reach 15 m in height. Leaves alternate, measuring 12 cm long by 6 wide. Flowers 3 mm in diameter, yellow, arranged in spikes branches. Fruit drupaceous, fusiform or oval, from 2–7 cm. The rind of the fruit is green even when ripe but becomes dark yellow when dry. The wood is white and fiber interlacing, very resistant to crushing. The leaves, extremely rigid and coriaceous, lend themselves to polishing artifacts of horn. Its value, however, in the past, derived from its seeds, rich in oil (60%) suitable for paint and varnish. On average, a foot of Oiticica produces 75 kg of nuts per season, but exceptionally, examples were recorded with production of up to 1,500 kilograms. Cultivation The oiticica nuts are used to make oiticica oil (Brazil). Oiticica oil finds limited use as a substitute for tung oil or linseed oil when the price of either of these products prohibit their use. Oiticica oil is much darker in color and is susceptible to transforming into a pasty, semi-solid state at room temperature. This requires heating prior to use.

The storm hit Central Virginia on January 25, 2000 causing thousands of power outages within the area leaving 11 inches in Richmond, VA and 20.3 inches in Raleigh-Durham International Airport before moving out to the Atlantic. Meteorological History The storm occurred during a mild winter with below-average snowfall across much of the East Coast. The major storm portion began on Friday January 21st; snow started falling on Wednesday. At the time many computer models suggested an area of low pressure would develop and track up the East Coast after getting energy from another low pressure system in Canada. But over the weekend, some computer models began to distort the rare idea of a formation with two low- pressure systems colliding and building up quickly. Most meteorologists thought to rename the event as a part of the Big Storm which was occurring in Canada at the time. In fact, most forecasters stopped mentioning snow by Monday January 24th. It turned out the Canadian storm helped build it up. Therefore, the storm's low-pressure system came from the Northern great lakes, entered over Appalachia, strengthened considerably and went into the North again to collide with the warm front that was approaching. A dip in the jet stream had created a trough which was causing rain in northern Florida with snow in Georgia. By the morning of the 24th, it was located in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico near Apalachicola, Florida. By the evening of the 24th, the storm was rapidly intensifying against the South Carolina coast. By Tuesday January 25th, it was near Hatteras, North Carolina. The storm moved northeastwards along the Atlantic Seaboard. Later on in the day it was located 80 miles east of Long Beach Island, New Jersey. It then began to weaken and by the next morning on the 26th, it was located just east of Portland, Maine. The storm was poorly forecasted because of the other simultaneous storm events and awkward build-up of two low pressure systems. Progression of the Storm Northern territories = In Pennsylvania, this storm was the most significant winter storm since the Blizzard of 1996. Progress throughout the northern territories were significantly more damaging due to high-winds, wet snow and sleet. There was sleet and freezing rain mixed in with the snow across Southeast Pennsylvania. Naturally businesses, schools, airports and government offices were closed on the 25th. Most municipalities declared the standard snow emergencies where accidents, traffic hazards and power outages occur. There were at least three confirmed deaths from heart attacks shoveling snow. About 2,000 homes and businesses lost power, mainly in the Philadelphia area. Snowfall rates of around 2 inches per hour were common during the first couple hours of this storm. Because of a warm front the following morning, it changed into sleet then freezing rain. It collided with a warm front in the northern territories. Snowfall rates of around 2 inches per hour were common during the first couple of hours during this storm. Some locations already had 4 inches of new snow on the ground. In Delaware, the change from wet to heavy dry snow helped cut down on the number of damages. The state of New Jersey got accumulation of about 6 to 15 inches of snow, sleet and freezing rain, wind gusts as strong as 60 mph along the shore, moderate coastal flooding and drifts as high as four feet. For the first time since 1996 county and government offices were closed. Many businesses and all schools were closed. Many malls never opened and all the others closed early. Snowfall rates of around 2 inches per hour were common during the first couple of hours during this storm. Some locations already had 4 inches of new snow on the ground due to the warmer air current above the ground and the precipitation intensity slackened, the snow began mixing with and changing over to sleet and freezing rain in the central and southern part of the state. Snow continued across northwest New Jersey, but its intensity was lighter during the late morning and afternoon hours. Central and Southern New Jersey spent most of the daylight hours in the storm's dry area - an area of lighter precipitation. The change to snow coincided with one last band of heavier snow that affected in New Jersey during the evening of the 25th. The snow ended around Midnight on the 26th. The winter storm caused numerous accidents around the region. There was significant wind recorded, in the southwestern territories the wind was not as severe. In Richmond, Virginia the snow fell as sleet then immediately turned into dry snow due to a high pressure system entering the eye of the vortex. The power-outages came late the following week due to the rise in temperatures with the snow already on the ground becoming wet snow.http://www4.ncsu.edu/~nwsfo/storage/cases/20000125/CNN_news_article.htm Loss and Damages In most of Pennsylvania 5-6 inches fell. The low-pressure was still dry in the south of Pennsylvania. In the south the mix started to change to sleet first and then snow. Precipitation was mainly snow with a little sleet mixed in around Philadelphia during the evening. The change to mainly snow coincided with another heavier band of precipitation that affected Eastern Pennsylvania during the evening of the 25th. The snow in Pennsylvania was wet snow due to temperatures close to freezing at the surface.

It is in the ecclesiastical province of Dublin. Until 1949, the designation of the Cathedral was the Cathedral Church of St. Ædan, a variant spelling of Edan or Aidan. Previously the cathedral of the Diocese of Ferns, it is now one of six cathedrals in the Diocese of Cashel and Ossory. History The original medieval Roman Catholic cathedral was built by Bishop St. John in the 1230s. A Catholic cathedral, also dedicated to Saint Aidan, was erected in Enniscorthy in the nineteenth century to a design by Pugin. Surviving ruin of the medieval chancel The building was burnt down in Elizabethan times by the O'Byrnes of Wicklow, and only a small portion of the ruins remain. Although Queen Elizabeth I of England ordered it rebuilt, only a section of the quire was restored. This was subsequently further altered in the early 1800s. The cathedral was reordered again in the early 1900s through the efforts of Thomas Brownell Gibson, Dean from 1908 until 1926.\\"The Cathedrals of the Church of Ireland\\" Day, J.G.F./ Patton, H.E. p115: London, S.P.C.K., 1932 An internal chancel arch was raised, and a quire and sanctuary created. Chapter stall were re-used from Kilkenny cathedral ( the classical stalls which they replaced are now in the extensive chapter house to the west of Ferns cathedral ). A new episcopal 'cathedra' was provide and the flat plaster ceiling of the church replaced with one of boarded wood in a gothic revival style. St. Edan's Cathedral, Ferns . Diocese of Cashel and Ossory. Retrieved on 12 September 2009. Of the surviving medieval fabric the blind arcading of the chancel is of particular note as are the north and south lancets and viscae of the East Wall. The central lancets are a conjectural restoration. There is a very fine medieval episcopal effigy by the font and the remains of some pillars of the quire arcade are to be seen in the walls to the west of the new chancel arch. The eighteenth or early nineteenth century west tower may well be on the site of a crossing of the mediaeval cathedral. An earlier belief that the present cathedral was part of the nave of the older building was based on the existence of remains of a separate medieval church, on the same axis, some way to the east. The chancel arcade and Eastern lancets challenge this conjecture as does the marked difference of floor level which, in the Eastern fragment, is some metres lower. Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (of the first creation), Lord of Leinster, Justiciar of Ireland (1130 - 20 April 1176), also commonly known as Strongbow (French: Arc-Fort), is sometimes said to have been interred at Ferns Cathedral, but there is no evidence for this, and Giraldus Cambrensis, who was a contemporary eyewitness, specifically notes that he was buried within sight of the cross at Christ Church cathedral in Dublin. Burials *Diarmait Mac Murchada *Domhnall Caomhánach Vandalism The cathedral was vandalised in early 2009 by youths. Many panes of glass were broken in the cathedral and the pane of glass protecting the magnificent east window was cracked.

There's a basic canteen where one can get food and tea. According to one of the popular legends Lord Ganesha chose this place as his abode. There is a temple devoted to Lord Ganesha here. Another name for this lake is 'Dhundital' meaning Ganesh ka tal or lake of Ganesha.

The trek towards Hanumanchatti is mule supported while for Gidara meadows the only option is porter support. Mythology Dodital : The Birthplace of Ganesha One fine morning at Dodital when Parvati was taking bath, she asked the dedicated bull of Lord Shiva to remain on the entryway of the shower region with the goal that nobody can enter the zone till she says. Nandi took the guidance steadfastly yet the master Shiva drew close to the entryway when Nandi obstructed his direction revealing to him that it was Goddess Parvati's guidance to hinder the way and don't allow anybody to come inside until the point that she says. Shiva get irate, he asserted that he is the spouse of Goddess Parvati and he has the privilege to go in. He additionally directed Nandi that it was Nandi's obligation to tune in to his guidelines. Furthermore, Nandi got defenseless and couldn't prevent him from going in. Goddess Parvati was annoyed with the episode and she thought of someone who will hear her out directions and will be faithful to her and no more. She took turmeric, shoe wood and clay of Dodital for showering and favored it with life and molded a little child out of it and named him Ganesha. Next time Parvati made Ganesha remain on the way to deny the passage. At the point when Shiva attempted to come in, Ganesha ceased him. Lord Shiva got furious seeing a little kid obstructing his direction. Seeing the little child's determined stand in not allowing Shiva through, he felt that the child was not a typical youngster but rather the one with some exceptional power. In outrage Shiva decapitated the young Ganesha. At this point when Goddess Parvati saw this deed she got extremely agitated and revealed that Ganesha was her creation. She was furious and made it clear that if she doesn't get Ganesha back, then she will demolish the whole creation. Hearing this frightened Lord Brahma as he is the maker of the world, and requested Goddess Parvati to calm down and stop the deed. Goddess Parvati expressed that she will stop if she gets Ganesha back alive and also wished that Ganesha's name be taken before beginning any auspicious deed(s) or task(s). Therefore, all Gods requested Shiva to bring Ganesha back alive, as there was a genuine concern for the safety of the universe. It was difficult for Lord Shiva to restore Ganesha back in the same shape as before. However, Lord Shiva considered fixing another head to Ganesha's body and eventually an elephant's head was placed instead. Lord Ganesha was brought back to life by Lord Shiva's blessing and since that time Lord Ganesha is called \\"Gajapati\\" the elephant-headed God.

Cahill. The film and book are based on the true story of the Ideal Maternity Home, a home for unwed pregnant mothers, during the Great Depression and Second World War. The home made millions from the illegal adoption of illegitimate babies during the 1930s and 1940s. Synopsis On the surface, Lila Young (Susan Clark) and her husband William (Peter MacNeill) are devout Christians pursuing their calling of helping young, unwed expectant mothers deliver their babies at the Ideal Maternity Home in Chester, Nova Scotia during the 1930s and 1940s. The medical community, however, is very skeptical about the safety of the procedures being conducted by Lila and the care being given to babies born at the Home. Skepticism soon becomes intense scrutiny when a routine delivery results in the death of a young mother and her baby. Desperate to continue their work and prove they are doing God's work, the Youngs start selling healthy babies to wealthy, childless couples. The babies that are born premature or unhealthy are poorly cared for and unceremoniously buried in wooden butter boxes if they die. The Youngs are out of business at the end of this shocking true story, but their years of illegally selling and burying babies makes it impossible to determine the extent of their atrocities to this day.

History Rolling Rock Club was originally of land owned by Judge Thomas Mellon, who left it to his son Richard Beatty Mellon, brother of Andrew Mellon and onetime president of Mellon Bank. Richard Beatty Mellon turned Rolling Rock into a rural retreat for his friends and family to hunt, fish, and ride. From this it steadily developed into an establishment that, in addition to the usual country club necessities — swimming pool and golf course — also boasted stocked trout streams, duck ponds, game birds and shooting ranges. The Club also kept a pack of English fox hounds, raising pheasants, and running the Gold Cup Steeplechase (from 1933 until 1983). R.B. Mellon left the estate to his son, Richard King Mellon, when he died in 1933. In the middle years of the twentieth century, Rolling Rock Club hunted over , mostly owned by 240 farmers whose acres surround the Mellon 18,000 acres. Currently, Rolling Rock is the most exclusive country club in Pennsylvania. Golf course The golf course at Rolling Rock Club in Laughlintown, Pennsylvania, was designed by Donald Ross and was built as a nine hole course in 1917. The club opened nine new holes, designed by Brian Silva, in May 1997. The course totals 6,176 yards from the back tees. With only two water hazards in the form of environmentally sensitive areas, there are plenty of sand bunkers. The greens are undulating, and the fairways are tree lined. The Hunt Stables The Hunt Stables were designed by Pittsburgh architect Benno Janssen and originally built in 1921 to house 28 stalls, a tack room, veterinarian's area, grooms' quarters, food storage, equipment rooms and a great round room where trophies and ribbons were displayed. With an intent to preserve the landmark of its heritage, in 1984 the building was converted into private condominiums, preserving as much of the existing architecture as possible. Every unit has its own entrance, individual identity and is autonomous with respect to neighboring units. Vestibules and fenestrated entrance hall additions were designed to increase area to an average of per unit. The private resort also features overnight accommodations.

It stars Oscar-winning Greer Garson, and was directed by Robert Z. Leonard, and written by William Roberts and Laura Z. Hobson. It was based on the best- selling pseudo-autobiographical book written by Louise Maxwell Baker, Snips and Snails. Louise herself taught at an all-boys boarding school, as the only female teacher in the school. Subsequently, Louise recounts many of the funny stories from her time as a teacher in Snips and Snails, which then translates into the film, Her Twelve Men. Plot Although she has no teaching experience, widow Jan Stewart is hired by headmaster Dr. Barrett to be the first woman to teach at The Oaks boarding school. Due to the fact that she is the only woman teaching at the school, the other faculty members either are condescending towards her or try to woo her. Jan gets to know her twelve students and fellow faculty member Joe Hargrave, who is dating the rich Barbara Dunning. Her young students hate her at first as she gives a strict punishment to a few boys who are disrupting her class; however, they begin to appreciate her nurturing and kind nature, and she begins to serve as mother for many of the boys who miss their actual parents. She has so much sympathy for one young boy, Bobby Lennox, whose globe-trotting parents neglect him, that she reads letters pretending they are from his mother that Jan wrote herself. A wealthy Texan widower, Richard Oliver, enrolls his son. Richard Jr. instantly alienates the other boys with his attitude and by refusing to confess to causing a fire alarm to go off, for which Dr. Barrett punishes the entire class. The other students in the class then all alienate Richard Jr., as he does not own up to his wrongdoing. This ultimately results in Richard Jr. being pushed out of a second-story window by the other students, causing him to break his leg. The boy's father wants him sent home and Jan is asked to accompany him on the journey. She wins young Richard's trust and gains Richard Sr.'s interest as well. Richard Jr. starts to treat Jan as a mother figure, as he severely misses his late mother. Later, Richard Sr. ends up proposing to Jan because of his feelings for her, as well as his son's, but Jan and Joe Hargrave ultimately realize they were meant for one another. Jan decides to continue to teach at The Oaks for another year after being begged by Joe Hargrave and her students. Richard Jr. also reconciles with the other students, and appears to finally be happy at The Oaks. Cast *Greer Garson as Jan Stewart *Robert Ryan as Joe Hargrave *Barry Sullivan as Richard Y.

The technique was pioneered by Hayne Leland and Mark Rubinstein in 1976. Since its inception, the portfolio insurance strategy has been dubiously marketed as a product (similar to an insurance policy). However, this is a misnomer as it is not a policy and there is no insurer of last resort. This strategy involves selling futures of a stock index during periods of price declines. The proceeds from the sale of the futures help to offset paper losses of the owned portfolio. This is similar to buying a put option in that it allows an investor to preserve upside gains but limits downside risk. Portfolio insurance is most commonly used by institutional investors when the market direction is uncertain or volatile. In practice, a portfolio insurance strategy uses computer-based models to analyze an optimal level of stock-to-cash ratios in various stock market conditions. Though the number of owned shares could stay the same, the total portfolio value changes with the market. As the market drops, a portfolio insurer would increase cash levels by selling index futures, maintaining the target ratio. Conversely, the same portfolio insurer might buy index futures when stock values rise. This combination of buying and selling of index futures is done in an effort to maintain the proper stock-to-cash ratio demanded by the portfolio insurance model or strategy. Contribution to the 1987 Stock Market Crash Both portfolio insurance and index arbitrage are commonly cited as two types of computer program trading which contributed to the stock market crash of October 19, 1987, also known as Black Monday. Though there is no debate that these two programs played a role in the crash, there seems to have been at least some debate as to the magnitude of their influence. Later analysis that year by a Committee of Inquiry under the Chicago Mercantile Exchange brought forth supporting evidence that the market selloff was more heavily influenced by larger forces such as mutual funds, broker-dealers, and individual shareholders.  Criticisms  Portfolio insurance has been roundly criticized over time as having been oversold in terms of its ability to protect the investor deploying it as a protection strategy. In its Preliminary Report, the Committee of Inquiry for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange outlined its criticism: > \\"[S]ome members of the Committee believe that the purveyors of so-called > \\"dynamic hedging\\" oversold these programs by marketing them as \\"insurance.\\" > There is no reason to believe, however, that the use of portfolio insurance > will diminish now that the limitations of the insurance concept have been > demonstrated.\\" In August of 2019, CNBC's Jim Cramer criticized portfolio insurance and the role it played during the 1987 crash.

It is known as \\"gentleman's villa\\" (villa da signore) already in the 15th century. The first known documents about this villa date back to 1472, when Agostino di Lotto Tanini and Agnolo di Zanobi Da Diacceto sold it to Bernardo d'Antonio degli Alberti. In 1481 it became property of the brothers Agnolo and Benedetto Bartolomei, then, at the beginning of the 16th century, was acquired by Raffaello and Miniato Miniati. It was then property of Bartolini Salimbeni, who modified the structure of the main building, of the Vinci family and, later, of the Boni family. In 1863 it was finally acquired by the Feri family, which eventually gave the current denomination (the Feri family Coat of Arms is still visible on top of the main gate). The building lies on higher grounds than the road delimiting its walls and it is symmetric in structure to the main door on Via del Podestà. The villa has two floors with a large tower-like room on top of 19th century making. On the front there is an Italian garden from the late 19th century with hedges of laurel, limes, cypress, platanus, and a water-well. On the rear is a large garden with a centennial pine tree, while the northern side is occupied by a large limonaia delimiting Via Martellini. On the external wall of the villa is a terracotta tabernacle with a Madonna with Child. The Feri family sold the villa to the current owners at the end of the 1980s. Since then it is also known as Villa Malavolta.

Story Tiny is a giant hamster, created in an accident in a laboratory. Mr Duk is a duck who acts as Tiny's agent, although this setup was referred to less and less as the characters evolved. This backstory was covered in a short video clip shown at the start of their segments on The Saturday Show during their first few months, but was dropped when they became established characters in their own right. Humour Most of the humour on the Tiny and Mr Duk segments was very surreal. For example, Tiny at one stage took to making short films with a pack of chorizos on peasticks, called \\"The Sausage Family\\", which would invariably end with one or more members of the family being eaten by a dog. They also regularly featured a video clip of a character named \\"Cherry Bakewell\\" – a man (played by Chapman) in a red velvet jacket, tight black trousers and ridiculously long pointy shoes who had a giant cherry bakewell tart in place of a head. He would be egged on by the studio to unleash mayhem in public. During their time on The Saturday Show, the characters also took part in some of the games, such as \\"Pot Shots\\" where they dressed as stereotypical Mexican bandits with velcro patches, and tried to dodge felt balls being fired at them by Joe Mace.

After graduating from a law college he started his service in Moscow, taking various legal posts. From 1870 till the end of his life he served as the Senator of the Criminal Cassation Department. From the 1840s he took a great interest in collecting engravings, including the luboks. His fundamental works on the history of Russian gravure and lubok were the first ones of the kind. His historical and bibliographical treatises, rich in actual data were highly estimated by art critics and have kept up their significance till date. Being the publisher of his own works, Dmitry Rovinsky paid a great attention to polygraphic processes (was one of the first who applied the heliograph) and printed books on excellent paper, with superb design, etc. Rovinsky signed away some of his assets to establish prizes for the best illustrated books for common folks, the best research work on art archeology and the best painting, in turn.

The school was established in 1828 as a boarding school for boys of the Quaker community, initially under Thomas Binns. One of its founders was Josiah Forster, who had attended the Quaker school his grandfather had founded in 1752, Forster's School, also in Tottenham. Its curriculum was advanced for its time, and it did not use corporal punishment. After languishing around 1850, it was enlarged by Arthur Robert Abbott, who admitted non-Quaker boys but after buying the school in 1877, closed it, and took Anglican orders. It was located on the south side of Tottenham Green next to the building of a former Quaker school which had closed some two years before its opening. The site was acquired for Tottenham Polytechnic which became the College of North East London (now the College of Haringey, Enfield and North East London following a merger with Enfield College August 2009). In 1890, the Quakers were to found another school, Leighton Park School, Reading as a direct descendent of Grove House. Following on from Grove House and in recognition of the earlier foundation of the school, the first senior Boarding House at Leighton Park was named Grove House. Grove House is a work by architect Alfred Waterhouse, who had attended the original Grove House School. Many families from Grove House continued the connection and sent their boys to Leighton Park, such as the Cadbury's, Foxes, Fry's, Backhouses and Hodgkin's.

It is based on Herman Melville's novel Typee, which was also the film's working title. The title song, \\"Enchanted Island\\", written by Stillman and Robert Allen, was performed on the soundtrack by The Four Lads, who had a hit recording of the song on Columbia Records. The film started out as an RKO movie, but when RKO when bankrupt, it was released by Warner Bros. Enchanted Island was also the next- to-last film directed by Dwan, whose prolific career dated back to 1913. It was the last big-screen appearance of one of the film's stars, Jane Powell. Plot Two 19th-century sailors, Abner (Dana Andrews) and Tom (Don Dubbins), jump ship after their captain, Vangs (Ted de Corsia), refuses them shore leave and warns them what a dangerous place this particular island is. They disobey him and soon discover their tropical paradise is a cannibal stronghold. There are two tribes on the island, one friendly, but the other, the Typee, a cannibal tribe. Jimmy Dooley (Arthur Shields), a white man like themselves, befriends the newcomers and offers them a \\"hideout,\\" but it turns out Dooley has been hired by Vangs to find his missing men. Abney becomes acquainted with the beautiful Fayaway (Jane Powell), adopted daughter of the chief, Mehevi (Friedrich von Ledebur), from a long-ago relationship between a shipwrecked sailor and a native girl. When a fight between tribes breaks out, Tom wants to flee but Abner likes island life and the girl. He fights with the Typee and saves Mehevi's life. Tom takes off, determined to get away from here and back to civilization. The chief approves of the love between Abner and Fayaway and permits them to wed. But soon comes the discovery that Tom did not get away, and when Abner and Fayaway interrupt a cannibalistic ritual, they are sentenced to death by Mehevi. When they try to run, Abner makes it back to the boat but Fayaway does not, a warrior piercing her with a spear. Abner carries her back to the boat and to Vangs, who once again understands why his sailors should never venture onto land.

He gained an international reputation both as a professional sports cyclist and a manufacturer of bicycles. Portrait of John Keen with cycle, taken at Kingston Museum 2009 Also known as ‘Happy Jack’, John Keen trained as a carpenter but his passion was the new sport of cycling on high bicycles (penny-farthing) which were newly developed from the velocipede. It has been reported that he began racing as early as 1869 and when a racing track opened in Surbiton he won the first event. He raced over a number of distances. In 1872 he was recorded as having ridden ten miles in less than 36 minutes and in 1874 he rode 50 miles in 3 hours and nine minutes. In May 1873 Keen, with James Moore introduced larger wheeled bicycles to France at the championships in Lyon where wheel sizes up to 45 inches had been the norm.Bicycle: The History, by David V.Herlihy Keen frequently competed against Fred Cooper for the One Mile Professional Championship. An athletic newspaper at the time reported that 12,000 people attended a meeting at Wolverhampton to see the men compete.http://www.badminton.exato.nl/books/library/cycling/cycling.pdf In the spring of 1876 John Keen travelled to New York with his bicycle.http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/Outing/Volume_18/outXVIII04/outXVIII04t.pdf By 1878 he was internationally reputed to be the fastest rider in the world, the professional champion of England and his name appeared on advertisements (in 1879) for the Columbia bicycle manufactured in the USA which stated his achievement of 1 mile in 2 minutes and 43 seconds (22 mph). In 1879 Keen, together with David Stanton and William Cann were invited to race in the United States against inexperienced local opposition. In pursuit of all records from one to twenty miles, Keen achieved 16 miles and 790 yards in one hour.http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/Outing/Volume_03/outIII01/outIII01v.pdf It was said that he sailed to New York to take on John S.Prince in 1883. In the 1870s Keen set up a business developing and manufacturing bicycles in Surbiton. Kingston Museum has an example of a bicycle bearing a badge \\"John Keen Surbiton Hill 1872\\". A printed notice held in the papers of the Cyclists' Touring Club reassures the public that he is still making his Eclipse bicycles to which there are significant improvements this year (September 1877). C.F. Caunter wrote that \\"John Keen, at Surbiton, built machines lighter and higher than had previously been thought possible.\\" He appears to have moved his business to Dalston Junction, then Clapham and latterly returning to Surbiton (Victoria Road). His cycles were known by the brand name ‘Eclipse’. Bartleet’s Bicycle Book (1931/32) describes a juvenile bicycle fitted with pedals \\" which are Keen's patent hanging pedals with a single ball bearing: these were the invention of \\"Jack\\" Keen, the famous professional rider, his patent No. 14867/1887.\\" His business moved to a workshop in Thames Ditton beside The Angel public house which was popular with cyclists using the Portsmouth Road. It is recorded in the census of 1901 that he lived at Claremont Terrace, Portsmouth Road, Long Ditton. He died in Finchley on 13 January 1902, of tuberculosis.

History Established in March 2006, the Unit Gempur Marin was created under the Royal Malaysia Police with the first name as the Unit Selam Tempur due to the pressing need of suppressing pirate attacks alongside the coastal area of Malacca Straits and open sea area of South China Sea which were continuously widespread from time to time despite various efforts done to overcome the problem. Throughout the year of 2006, 239 cases of pirate attacks were reported according to statistics of the International Maritime Bureau, Kuala Lumpur.

Nevertheless, law enforcement agencies from the three countries continue to be vigilant against pirate activity in the Straits of Malacca. For the unit's restructuring, the name of UST was changed to Unit Gempur Marin or UNGERIN in the year 2008. Its eventual goal is to have 200 operators on standby with UNGERIN. Roles The roles of the RMP UNGERIN are predominantly focused on, but not restricted to the littoral and riverine waterborne domains, including: * Coastal reconnaissance * Covert beach reconnaissance (Hydrographic survey) in advance of amphibious assault * Recovery or protection of vessels and oil rigs to hostile state or non-state (including terrorist and piracy) action. * Maritime counter-terrorism * Support to Navy Forces, Coast Guard and customs * Offensive action For this, UNGERIN operators are to patrol the following places: * Ports, lakes, dam * Islands * Vessels in Estuaries * Waters that have human/boat traffic Training Masked UNGERIN operators armed with the MP5A3 submachine gun while on duty at Muar city after the launching of Community Policing by Johor Chief Minister Dato Abdul Ghani Othman. Based on this critical need, a specific doctrine from RMP led to the establishment of a marine elite unit performing said task. Approximately 30 members of the squad (69 Commando personnel were sent to this unit), and the unit will be upgraded to a strength of 100 in the future with 70 personnel employed in stages in the duration of two years after receiving approval from the Public Service Department, which are divided to three detachments, to guard the waters of Malacca Straits and the Sulu Sea. This unit was basically trained by the 69 Commandos of PGK. Then, they was trained by the US Navy SEALs from a training exercise code- named Fusion Mint. Training is also carried out with the aid of US Coast Guard and various intelligence agencies. The unit is currently being trained in Langkawi and Kota Kinabalu. Most of these instructors were Navy SEALs personnel. Besides the advanced diving training, they will be trained with other advanced training, including tactical warfare, HALO jump, marksmanship, sniping, bomb disposal, direct action, sabotage, counter-terrorism, and intelligence gathering as well as paramedic training, along with special missions which are normally handled by special forces. On 2 February 2007, UST anti-terror marine police and 69 Commandos trained abroad with the Japan Coast Guard (JCG), Royal Thai Marine Police (RTMP) and Thai Marine Department (TMD) for the combating maritime robberies exercise at waters of Ku Tarutao, Thailand, four nautical miles from the Malaysia-Thai border. The Japan Coast Guard deployed the PLH22 YASHIMA 5,000 tons patrol vessel to Langkawi for this mock exercise. UNGERIN has recently participated with the Royal Malaysian Navy on 28 March 2009. Capabilities VBSS exercise on a \\"hijacked ship\\" during LIMA '09. UNGERIN has been trained in maritime capabilities such as: * Diving both closed and open circuit * Maritime counter-terrorism/Force Protection * Close Quarters Battle (especially in hijacking ships) * Demolition * Vertical insertion (Fast-roping technique) * Search and Rescue * Underwater demolition unit * Port Protection/Counter-sabotage * Canoeing - Use of the folding canoe during selection * Underwater Port Security * Mines detection * Beach reconnaissance * Tactical boat operations * Paramedic capability On qualification, Marine Police of the UNGERIN wear the blue berets with light blue hackle and camouflage uniform, as the uniforms were worn by paramilitary and special forces of RMP. All tactics of maritime commandos are exactly similar to those of the UK Special Boat Service as well as US Navy and USMC special forces units. As part of UNGERIN's restructuring, all marine police bases would be made coastal police stations with forward bases to double as coastal police posts for UNGERIN forces to rapidly respond to maritime threats. Furthermore, the unit is very active in developing and testing methods and tactics for these missions. Weapons and equipment UNGERIN officers are frequently seen armed with an M4A1 carbine when an maritime operation or a raid is being conducted while the Walther P99QA pistol is used as the standard issue sidearm. They also use a varied arsenal of weapons such as Glock 19 pistols, Heckler & Koch HK512 and Remington 870 shotguns, Heckler & Koch MP5 sub-machine guns, FN SCAR-H battle rifles,https://www.facebook.com/PolisDirajaMalaysia/photos/a.1754437937899839.1073743688.161086313901684/1754446237899009/?type=3&theater; Accuracy International Arctic Warfare sniper rifles and Heckler & Koch PSG1 marksmen rifles, Heckler & Koch HK11 general purpose machine guns, M203 grenade launchers and Colt CM901 battle rifles. The unit has its own RHIB navy transport speedboat with the capability of holding ten passengers and traveling at 60+ knots. Two engines with 250 brake horsepower increase its maritime operational capabilities. On 11 July 2007, the RMP purchased ten Marine Alutech Watercat M14 PSC class landing craft vessels from Marine Alutech OY AB Service. These have 22 passengers capacity and 30 knots speed, and are possibly equipped with 12.7mm NSV machine gun, 40mm grenade launcher and 120m Patria NEMO mortar for use by marine police as well as UNGERIN operatives for amphibious assault duties even in shallow waters. The boats are built by Geliga Slipway Sdn Bhd in Malaysia. The boats are to be supplied in 2008-2009. For equipment, UNGERIN basically uses commercial scuba diver equipment. All operatives are equipped with lightweight PRO-TEC helmets, fire- resistant Nomex coveralls, or BDUs (battle dress uniform), plate carriers for carrying ammunition and specialist equipment, tactical gloves, balaclava or protective face covering, protective eye goggles, gas masks, flashlight (usually a Surefire or Heckler & Koch brand), combat steel reinforced boots, flexi-cuffs, and thigh ammo. Ballistic vests including rigid plate inserts, are standard issue. These vests are labelled with \\"POLICE\\", RMP insignia, or not labelled, to allow for easy identification. They often use drop leg holsters, while some officers prefer hip holsters. Notable operationsOperation Barracuda= UNGERIN operators had participated in an anti- smuggling operation, seized smuggled RM 2 million worth of contraband liquor, beer and cigarettes smuggled in from Labuan. Two local youths were nabbed while several others fled into the mangrove swamp when police identified themselves at 9PM on Sunday at Sungai Kampung Tananak near Menumbok, about 130 km. That 30 personnel, led by ASP Fauzi Ibrahim, seized 1,100 liquor bottles and 36,700 packets of various cigarette brands in a special operation code- named Ops Barracuda. They also seized nine boats, each equipped with 200HP engines, used for smuggling operations between the duty-free island and mainland Sabah. Police were investigating the activities of the syndicate and trying to identify the mastermind. =Operation Daulat= The operators was sent to Lahad Datu, Sabah as part of the Malaysian security forces team to secure the area from an armed terrorists known as Royal Security Forces of the Sultanate of Sulu and North Borneo (). Other than the official duties of storming, searching and \\"cleaning up\\" the villages the terrorists entered, the UNGERIN has also been busy doing something similar, but in charge of coastal areas. Led by ASP Mohd Aris Jambul as a Field Commander of Marine 4th Region, an UNGERIN operators perform to secure a 20 km beachhead from Kampung Tanduo to Kampung Tanjung Batu, Kampung Labian, Kampung Sungai Bilis and Kampung Sungai Nyamuk, to be currently unoccupied.  Future planning  Marine Operations Force (MOF) plans to combining two of its elite unit, UNGERIN and MOF Diving Unit, into one special command. As December 2014, there are only 60 divers from MOF Diving Unit and 60 operators from UNGERIN which is relatively small if compared to other Malaysian special units.

It was directed by Roy Del Ruth and written by Devery Freeman and Roland Kibbee, based on the George S. Kaufman play The Butter and Egg Man. Ray Heindorf was the musical director, with orchestrations by Gus Levene, and vocal arrangements by Norman Luboff. Choreography was by LeRoy Prinz. The soundtrack features original songs with music composed by Sammy Fain and lyrics by Sammy Cahn. As was the practice at the time, the soundtrack album was a studio recording [Capitol L-485 (10\\" LP) and FBF-485 (2 EP Box-Set)]. The Capitol Records album was released early in 1954, and featured eight of the songs from the Fein/Cahn songwriting team. The film's stars Jane Powell and Gordon MacRae are the featured vocalists. George Greeley conducted the orchestra and chorus. The album was re-issued and released on CD in 2006; it contained 12 more songs by MacRae. Plot While their submarine is docked in New York City, three sailors on liberty invest the money they've earned at sea in a Broadway musical and its up-and-coming star. Choirboy Jones (Gordon MacRae) carries a gunnysack stuffed with $50,000 in cash from his fellow sailors. Joe Woods (Sam Levene), producing a new show starring the singer Emilio Rossi (George Givot), is delighted to find a new investor, but female lead Penny Weston (Jane Powell) is worried that the boys are in over their heads. After the show's out-of-town opening is a flop, Woods, Rossi and even the author want out. Penny consults some distinguished Broadway artists for their advice, which includes casting the talented singer Jones, dancer Twitch (Gene Nelson) and comic Porky (Jack E. Leonard) in key roles. The show is a smash and the sailors reap a handsome return on their investment, with Jones and Penny falling in love as a bonus.

His father Maiya Singh had served in the army of former princely State of Kapurthala where he held the rank of army Major. He was also the Zaildar of the village. Education and military career Lal Singh received his education up to B.Sc and then joined the army of Maharaja of Kapurthala as a lieutenant. In 1933, Lieutenant Lal Singh was attached with Inspector General Police, Kapurthala to look after and resolve the Tajia issue in Sultanpur Lodhi where Sikh-Muslim riots appeared imminent due to Adamant attitude of both communities. The issue was tactfully and firmly handled. Later Lieutenant Lal joined the army of princely State of Patiala where he soon promoted to the rank of Colonel. Progressive farmer After retirement from Military service after partition in 1947, Col Thind took several of his co-villagers from Turna and purchased a big tracts of land in Rudurpur city, District Rampur now Udham Singh Nagar in Uttarakhand. The land was fertile and virgin but all jungle and was infested with wild and dangerous animals like tigers and wolves, boars and fierce cobras etc. at the time of its purchase. With dedication and discipline of a true soldier, Col Thind managed to turn his tract, running into thousands of acres, into a flourishing tillable land over the years and started the progressive farming using the ultra modern scientific techniques. He named his farm as Baradari farm. Col Thind soon caught the eyes of the Government of India for producing highest yield/acre for rice, wheat, sugarcane and several other crops in his farm. He was widely recognized for this achievement and was conferred upon the Padma Shri award by Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the third President of India in 1965. It was the first award ever given to any farmer throughout India. In 1966, an All India Seed Improvement Seminar was held in New Delhi which was presided over by Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister of India. Col Thind was the special guest in the Seminar and was chosen to speak on the topic. In 1968-70, Dr Zakir Hussain, the fourth President of India also invited and honored Col Thind and awarded him certificates in recognition of his outstanding achievements as the most progressive farmer of India. A progressive farmers’ meeting was held in USA (United States of America) in July 1973 which from Indian side was attended and represented by Col Thind alone. Death and legacy Col Thind died on July 7, 1973. One brother of Lal Singh was MBBS doctor and had retired as Chief Medical Officer.

History In August 1746, pioneer Antônio Bueno de Avezedo left Paracatu, Minas Gerais, leading a large group to the northwest. After having gone through rivers, tablelands and large brooks, on August 13 he arrived at a brook where he found gold. He founded a village, which he named “Santa Luzia”, paying homage to the saint of the day. This brook was known as “Rio Vermelho” (Red River), in reference to the waters, loamy due to gold washing. Santa Luzia village grew into today's Luziânia, Goiás. By early 1747, the first clergyman, Luís da Gama Mendonça, had arrived at Santa Luiz, at Bueno’s request. It’s supposed that, in homage to the clergyman, the region was named “Gama”. The lands that today constitute the Administrative Region of Gama, in which the satellite city of Gama is located, belonged to local farmers. When the capital of Brazil was transferred upcountry, the farmlands were dispossessed by the government of Goiás, between 1956 and 1958, under the responsibility of a Commission organized to transfer the capital of Brazil, presided over by Altamiro de Moura Pacheco. The headquarters of a farm called “Gama” was close to the Catetinho (first official residence of President Juscelino Kubitschek); nevertheless the city was settled away from this reference point. President Juscelino Kubitschek visited Gama on October 2, 1956, on his first visit to the region where the new capital would be built. The city was initially created to shelter people resident in invasions or provisional shelters, or those that would work on Brasília’s construction, as one of the first so-called “satellite cities”, in accordance with law no. 3,751, approved on April 13, 1960. Architect Paulo Hungria had, by May 1960, developed the blueprint of the city, which would have the form of a beehive, dividing it into five sectors: North, South, East, West and Centre. The Centre Sector (for trade activities) was not so detailed due to future needs. Notwithstanding this, engineer José Maciel de Paiva, by order of mayor Israel Pinheiro (former president of Novacap), was charged with setting up a pioneer center and promoting the first transferences from September 1960 on. He was assisted by an engineer, José Carlos Godoy, by an inspector, Agnelo Dias Correia, and by a master-builder, Joaquim Santana and others. The initial settlement was carried out by removing 30 families resident in the “Barragem do Paranoá”. Later, the city received many of the former residents of “Vila Amaury” and “Vila Planalto”. In 1970, the inhabitants settled in the Industry Sector of Taguatinga were transferred.

It is assigned to the 69th Reconnaissance Group and is stationed at Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily, Italy. The squadron was first established in the Panama Canal Zone as the 7th Aero Squadron in 1917 and served as a reconnaissance unit until 1942, when it was redesignated as the 397th Bombardment Squadron. It served as a bomber unit through World War II and was inactivated at Rio Hato Army Air Base, Panama on 1 November 1946. The squadron was reactivated in 2015, returning to its earlier reconnaissance mission. History The squadron's mission from its inception in 1917 to its inactivation in 1946 was the defense of the Panama Canal. During the 1920s and 1930s it participated in a number of goodwill missions to nations in Central and South America. From its origins in 1917 until 1942, the unit was designated a variation of the 7th Reconnaissance Squadron. =World War I= Curtiss R-4L With the entry of the United States into World War I, the War Department believed it was necessary to establish an air presence along the Atlantic terminus of the Panama Canal as a defensive measure against an enemy seaborne attack. In advancing its plans for the defense of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States, the joint Army-Navy board recommended the establishment of eight aeronautic stations which, with a strength of two dirigibles and six or eight seaplanes each, could immediately conduct patrol work. Significantly, the only site definitely advanced as vital in the overall plan was that at the Coco Solo United States Navy submarine base near Colón in the Canal Zone. The Army selected Captain Henry H. Arnold, then in training at the Army Aviation School at Rockwell Field, near San Diego, to proceed immediately to the Canal Zone and form and command an aviation squadron there. This unit was designated the 7th Aero Squadron and was organized on 29 March 1917. Captain Arnold did not remain long with the 7th Aero Squadron, however, as he returned to the United States in April 1917. The squadron personnel arrived for duty in the Canal Zone with 51 officers and enlisted men. Initially garrisoned at Ancón, Canal Zone at the end of March 1917, the unit moved to Corozal by 16 April. They then moved to the large temporary camp at Empire, Canal Zone in May, all on the Pacific side of the isthmus – not making the move to Fort Sherman's parade field until around 29 August 1917, on the Atlantic side. The unit did not receive its first aircraft until about 10 December 1917, when two Curtiss R-4's were tested at Fort Sherman. These were followed by Curtiss R-6's on 12 February 1918 which were supplied by the Navy. Besides its Curtiss R-4's and R-6's, the unit also had two Curtiss R-3's which, oddly, had arrived after the R-4's, in late December 1917. With the end of World War I most of the 7th Aero Squadron's personnel were transferred back to the United States for demobilization. =Between the wars= de Havilland DH-4s at Rio Hato Airfield, Panama, 1920s Douglas B-18 Bolo at Aguadulce Field, Panama. B-17B Flying Fortress After the war, the squadron evolved into the 7th Squadron (14 March 1921), 7th Observation Squadron (25 January 1925), 7th Reconnaissance Squadron (1 September 1937), 7th Reconnaissance Squadron (Medium Range) (6 December 1939) and 7th Reconnaissance Squadron (Heavy) (20 November 1940) before being finally redesignated as the 397th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) on 22 April 1942. The squadron was assigned to the 6th Composite Group. After World War I, the squadron is credited with having operated numerous aircraft types between 1919 and 1931. These included, the venerable U.S.-built Dayton-Wright DH-4 series of light bomber/general purpose aircraft; the Curtiss JN-4 \\"Jenny\\" family of trainers; the Loening OA-1 amphibians, these being uniquely suited to conditions in Panama, Douglas O-2 observation aircraft and, surprisingly, Curtiss HS-1 and HS-2L flying boats. Of the DH-4's, the first six postwar examples, all virtually stock DH-4B's, arrived for duty with the 7th in February 1920, replacing the well-worn Curtiss R-6's and other earlier DH-4's. By 16 February 1922, the squadron had seven \\"war-built\\" DH-4's, four DH-4B's, the solitary Curtiss JN-4H, three Curtiss JN-6's. By August, all but one of the \\"war-built\\" DH-4's had been scrapped and one of the DH-4B's had been converted to DH-4BP-1 (photographic) configuration. By June 1927, the squadron, now in a very lean peacetime stance, had but eight aircraft. These consisted of four DH-4M's, a solitary DH-4B, a Loening OA-l and two Loening OA-1As. In 1937, the 6th Group, which had been a composite unit since its establishment in 1919, became the 6th Bombardment Group.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 41–43 The squadron was equipped with Douglas B-18 Bolos, although a single Northrop A-17 Nomad was also assigned for a period, together with a Sikorsky OA-8. By 1 February 1940, the assignment to the 6th Bombardment Group was changed to an attachment, as the unit was reassigned to the 19th Composite Wing and placed under the control of the Caribbean Air Force staff as one of the dedicated reconnaissance elements reporting to that headquarters. On 4 June 1941, it was assigned one Boeing B-17B Flying Fortress, the first production version of the Flying Fortress, which had been transferred to the command. Obsolete as a bomber, the mission of the B-17B was long-range reconnaissance in the Canal Zone, although the aircraft retained its defensive machine guns for defense against any enemy aircraft it may encounter On 8 October 1941, it was once again assigned to the 6th Bombardment Group and, on 27 November, the unit moved from France Field to the newly constructed Howard Field on the Pacific side, where it received four additional B-17Bs. =World War II= Northrop A-17A After the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor the Squadron was almost immediately deployed to David Field, Panama. The Squadron's B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft deployed elsewhere (mainly to Guatemala City Airport) to begin the Pacific patrols in early January 1942. The squadron was redesignated as the 397th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) effective 22 April 1942. The return to David Field came just in time for deployment of the unit as a whole from David to Talara Airfield, Peru, where it arrived on 18 August. From there the squadron undertook the Pacific patrol arc out to Seymour Airport in the Galápagos Islands and, sometimes, on to Guatemala City Airport. These flights continued, almost non-stop, through May 1943, when the unit was relieved and returned to Río Hato Field in Panama. The LB-30s retained their original British serial numbers throughout their service with the squadron. Upon its return to Rio Hato on 4 May 1943, the 397th was transformed, as an entirely new cadre of personnel replaced the veterans of the Galapagos and earlier tours there. Three days later, the Squadron moved to Howard Field in the Canal Zone, although this was apparently a mere paper move of its headquarters, as the unit's aircraft and personnel actually remained at Rio Hato. On 1 January 1944, the squadron received orders to deploy four of its LB-30s to France Field to participate in the search for several marauding German U-Boats which were causing considerable alarm in the Caribbean. While at France Field, the aircraft also flew navigational and bombing exercises. All of this was preparatory to the unit's deployment to the Galapagos Islands and, starting 7 April 1944, the ground echelon started movement to Balboa, Canal Zone, via truck for the transfer. The air element got four more B-24J's on 8 April and, with these, flew with the earlier two B-24J's and two B-24D's to Seymour Field in the Galapagos. Other missions, besides the normal long-distance patrols, saw 397th aircraft operating to Salinas Airport, Ecuador; Havana Airport, Cuba; Borinquen Field, Puerto Rico; Managua Airport, Nicaragua; Cartagena airport, Colombia and elsewhere throughout Central and South America. In February 1945, the unit was relieved from duty in the Galapagos and returned to Rio Hato, where the unit ended the war, on 1 November 1946 when it was inactivated. =Reactivation in 2015= On 1 May 2015, the unit was redesignated 7th Reconnaissance Squadron. It was reactivated at Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily, Italy on 15 May, where it replaced Detachment 1, 69th Reconnaissance Group. It is assigned to the 69th Group at Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota.

Plot summary Jeremy Bradford, the captain of an ocean liner, visits his teenaged daughter named Polly, and takes her to see a performance of the opera Aida. Polly is entranced by the singing talents of Olaf Eriksen and Zita Romanka. Upon learning that Olaf and Zita will be passengers on her father's voyage to Rio de Janeiro, she begs her father to come along, but Captain Bradford says no. He is furious when he eventually discovers that Polly is on board his ship as a stowaway, and he puts her to work in the ship's galley. Also on board is Laura Dene, a jilted bride, and her fiancé Charles, who can't decide if he wants to marry her. Polly and Laura become friends, though Laura isn't aware at first that Polly is the captain's daughter.

It has normally produced modern and vintage European vehicles, especially those of French origin – though Italian, German, British, and American vehicles were also produced. Norev's closest competition was Solido, but that company had more pan-European influence, while Norev was more national in orientation. History Model Ford Vedette from Norev According to the official website, Norev was founded by the Véron brothers, in the suburb of Villeurbanne, near Lyon, France, in 1946 (Rixon 2005, p. 54). Norev is the family name spelled backwards. In 1953, after the first plastics toy fair in Oyonnax, Joseph Véron started using the new plastic 'Rhodialite' for a series of toys (Ralston 2008, p. 25). The company's first product was a small tin service garage with several plastic cars in about 1/87 scale. Other products at the company's start were toy watches, miniature sewing machines, a doll's feeding set and other plastic toys for infants (Ralston 2008, p. 25). Also in 1953, was the watershed of the first Norev vehicles to appear. These were in 1:43 scale and manufactured in plastic. The plastic series consisted of 12 vehicles up through 1956, but then expanded rapidly to more than 96 models in 1964 (Ralston 2008, p. 26). Force's book (1991, pp. 164–235) shows that throughout the whole run of all Norev vehicles, without regard to scale or type, models were sequentially numbered from the first car as no. 1 in plastic (a Simca Aronde – 1953–1956) through no. 899 in zamac (a VW Golf Rally – 1984–1988) and beyond. The early models had colorful unpainted bodies which was a main selling point (Ralston 2008, 25–26). While earlier models tended to feature semi-realistic colors similar to what contemporary car manufacturers were offering, later models tended to stray away from realism and offered vibrant, less realistic colors, such as bright orange or lime green. In the mid-1960s, Norev toyed with the idea of adopting colorless plastic bodies which would then be spray-painted in metallic colors. The experiment seemed to have been fairly short-lived, with only 5 known models released: the Ford Anglia 105E Deluxe, the Lancia Flaminia, the Fiat 2300, the DAF Daffodil and the Morris Mini 850. Initially, the models chosen were French cars, such as the Simca Aronde (the first Norev model introduced), Renault 4CV, Ford Vedette, Peugeot 203, Citroën DS 19, Renault Dauphine, Panhard Dyna Z, Peugeot 403 and Citroën H Van, among others (Ralston 2008, pp. 30–33). The first non-French model to be released was the Mercedes-Benz W196 racecar in 1956, followed by the Jaguar 2.4L MK1 saloon a year later. As the years progressed, foreign cars would be added to the Norev range in rapid succession. Model details Plastic model Ford Taunus 17M in 1:43 scale from Norev Norev plastic models were known for their bright body colors and their red (sometimes black) plastic hubs with white tires. Some of the attention to detail is notable, such as with the Citroën DS sedan. For instance, on the real car, the roof section is a separate plastic piece. The Norev toy also made the roof a separate plastic section, allowing for a greater variety of color combinations. In addition to this, Norev released all 3 versions of the DS19: the initial version launched in 1956, the first facelift with metal hood vents to aid cooling, released in 1961, and the second facelift in 1963, where the hood vents were replaced with holes under the headlights. Unfortunately, the Rhodialite plastic used in the models was prone to fading and warping after excessive exposure to sunlight. By the mid-1970s, Norev did rectify this via the usage of a lighter plastic with a more matte finish, Most early models were available in both free- wheeling and friction motor versions (Ralston 2008, pp. 26, 31), though the motorised models were discontinued by the early 1960s. Early bases were unpainted and made of metal, but from 1956 onwards, models started being equipped with black plastic ones. Detail and proportion were very good and though the early models lacked windows (the Citroen DS was the first model to sport them), they were very successful and cheaper than the diecast metal competition (read that 'Dinky'; Ralston 2008, p. 25). Most models did not have many accessories, unlike the competitors Minialuxe, but a few items like roof skis did occasionally appear, like on the Panhard Dyna (Ralston 2008, p. 32). After about 1960, opening features began to appear on some – like the opening doors on the Renault 4 van or the Land Rover Expedition, which also featured a spare tire and roof luggage / equipment rack. By the end of the 1960s, models would feature multiple different opening parts. In the case of the Peugeot 504, released in 1969, the model featured 4 opening doors, as well as an opening hood and trunk. Also, different companies would often be advertised on the sides of the model trucks and vans, like Locatel telephone, Cibie lights, or Fleury Michon, a provider of meat products (Ralston 2008, p. 33). The most common models for these promotional models were the Citroën 2CV Van and Type H, Renault Estafette and 4 Van, and the Peugeot J7. Through the 1950s the red hubs were replaced with more detailed chrome ones and tires gradually became black (though some white tires were used until the late 1950s) and windows were added. In 1957, a 1:87 scale '500 / Micro-Norev' series appeared, mostly consisting of the same models that appeared in the 1:43 scale line. Still, some unique models, not issued in the 1:43 scale series, did appear, mainly the Renault Caravelle and the Peugeot 403 pick-up. In 1961, Émile Véron of the Véron family started Majorette, a separate company, also in the Lyon area. This new smaller line of cars would be competition for Matchbox and Siku Toys. Going Diecast The first diecast metal Norev models appeared about 1965 (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, 64–65,86). Later, the famous 'Jet-Car' series, appeared in 1971. These were hierarchically labeled the '600', '700', and '800' series, sequentially as discussed above, according to cost. The '600' line was cheaply made and production soon stopped. The HO scale line was discontinued, but in the late 1970s, Force says that 1:66 scale Schucos appeared as a Norev line (the Mini-Jet series). The Mini-Jets were lauded for good castings while criticized for cheap plastic interiors and poor packaging (Rixon 2005, p. 55). Also, a Maxi-Jet line consisted mainly of trucks. Norev Jetcar 1:43 Porsche 924 Polizei from the 1970s. Rear hatch opens. Front silver turn signals and rear tail light lenses are hand painted. Norev's main competition in the 1960s and 1970s was Solido, though Norev's offerings and approach to the market was somewhat more toy oriented, while Solido appealed more to older collectors. For example, Norev wheel designs were often simple, compared to the very accurate designs of Solido. Norev wheels were particularly generic and toy-like during the 'Jet Car' era when manufacturers everywhere were mimicking Mattel's thin axle Hot Wheels. Even early on Norev cars had cost-saving plastic bases while many others manufacturers were still making bases in diecast metal (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, 64–65). Nevertheless, Norev's cars were usually of excellent detail and proportion compared to real vehicles. One work that catalogs the extent and detail of Norev offerings was Le Monde Fantastique du Norev authored (in French) by Didier Beaujardin (2005). Packaging and Marketing From the beginning, Norev used creative packaging and marketing. The early line glorified the benefits of plastic – early models came with an attached rectangular paper tag saying \\"Rhodialite, Light, Solid and Strong\\" (In French, \\"Legerete, Solidite, Fidelite; see Ralston 2008, pp. 30–31). The company used successful advertising ploys like supplying toy shops with paper bags displaying the Norev line (Ralston 2008, pp. 25, 32). Norev boxes could be very intriguing (and sometimes rather fragile). For example the 1950s offerings came in cardboard boxes designed to mimic wooden packing crates with pictures of the cars on the sides (Ralston 2007, pp. 30–31). Cars came with sweepstakes offers and much printed information. For example, the Jet-Car 800 series from 1974 had TWO sweepstakes offers. One was for the \\"Great Norev Game\\" (\\"Grand Jeu Norev\\") where one could collect the cartoon characters Norev, Jimmy, Tic, Costo, Comete, and Speed, color them and mail them back to the Norev 'Service Club' for prizes. Coloring had to be intricate though as the illustration of 'Tic' in the 1974 Renault 17 TS Coupe (no. 823) was only about two inches square. In the same package were coupons for the \\"Great Norev Rally\\" (\\"Grand Rallye de Norev\\"). Collect enough stamps, accumulating mileage in the rally, and you could win a Norev model car of your choice. Though Norev models could be ultra detailed, their packaging colors and offers seemed aimed at a younger clientele while Solido was more serious and rather stately in aiming its cars, more often in clear plastic display cases, at collectors – without sweepstakes and games. LudOrev, France and China Renault Master Mini bus Sometime around 1980, Norev either created or was taken over by LudOrev, which also issued other toys and doll playsets. Apart from the repeating of the last four letters \\"-orev\\", the origin of the name is unclear. Jet-Car packaging around the late 1980s said \\"LudOrev locataire gerente de Norev\\" (\\"tenant manager of Norev\\"). Possibly, the same old dies that were made and packaged in France were sold under the LudOrev name, distinguishing them from new offerings made in China. In the early 1980s, Norev was acquired by daughter company Majorette just as Solido had been. Majorette was acquired by Smoby which in turn was taken over by the Simba Dickie Group. Today, Majorette remains part of Simba- Dickie, but Norev was spun off. In 1981 some of the earlier plastic models were reintroduced and then discontinued around 1984. Some of the lines were named \\"Plastigam\\" perhaps harking back to the plastic body days, but later the name was also used on diecast cars and their boxes. Citroën SM in 1:18 scale, made in China Norev has moved upscale with new collectible vehicles aimed more at adults. With the new millennium, Norev has taken several new directions while keeping its heritage. In 2005, a line of Japanese brand cars was inaugurated in addition to its 1:18 scale series. This approach mirrors that of other companies like Solido, Corgi Toys, and Schuco Modell where 1:43 scale cars are priced in the $30 to $40 range, while 1:18 scale lines sell for $60 to $70. Again, most of these newer models are made in China. In 2006, Norev celebrated its 60th anniversary, with the creation of a customised Chrysler 300 C with the help of tuning company Parotech. Company Directions Norev around 2010 has exhibited a couple of main trends. One is the relegation of certain models either sold by, or made under, other brand names. For example, several former Norev castings were made and sold as Atlas Editions collectors models, especially their series of French presidential limousines like the Citroen SM Presidentielle. Whether the cars are made by Norev for Atlas Editions or the castings sold off to Atlas and other companies is uncertain. Another trend, as seen on the official website, is that Norev has acquired or re-introduced several venerable old diecast brands, including the French CIJ name and Provence Moulage. In 2008, Norev also reintroduced the Spot-On brand once made by Tri-Ang in Northern Ireland. This was a bit odd since Spot-On did not at all have a French flavor in its offerings. Whereas CIJ focuses on trucks and industrial models and Norev on more everyday French cars with some racing versions, the angle of Provence Moulage seems to be on French historical and concept vehicles of more upscale model pricing. Also in 2008, under the auspices of CIJ, it was announced that the historic brand of JRD would also be launched, but as of 2011, no new JRD models seem to have been produced. Thus Norev, more than the more global Solido, has remained a very French entity traveling along a very nostalgic path reviving other lost French (and English) toy brands. Today, though much production has gone to China, the company is still headquartered near Villeurbanne, east of Lyon, in the municipality of Vaulx-en-Velin.

After saving his captain, major and colonel in the American Revolutionary War, he rose to the rank of major-general. He was the older brother of fellow soldiers General George Rogers Clark and Captain William Clark of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Navy to army for ten to nine years. Clark was the oldest brother of the children of John Clark and Ann Rogers, was born in Albemarle County, Virginia on August 1, 1750. He received a fair English education, and, in time, became a lawyer, and a successful man of business. He was the prudent, practical business man of the elder portion of the numerous children of John Clark, as his brother William was of the younger. When quite young he spent some time in the office of the clerk of Spottsylvania county, Virginia, as deputy clerk. In 1772 he removed to Woodstock, in the county then called Dunmore, but which was afterwards changed to Shenandoah, and was very soon taken into public favor by being selected, with the celebrated Peter Muhlenberg, to serve as delegate from the county in an important convention held at Richmond in the interests of the colonies. About this time trouble began between the citizens of Virginia, and the royal governor, Lord Dunmore, which culminated in the latter seizing the public powder belonging to the colony without authority. This led to an uprising of the colonists to regain possession of the powder, by force if necessary, and young Clark marched towards Williamsburg, the then capital, as lieutenant of an independent company of riflemen for that purpose. Clark's company returned home, however, without bloodshed, and he and Muhlenberg were again sent as delegates to the convention which met at Richmond in December, 1775. In the spring of 1776, Clark was promoted to the captaincy of a company (commissioned March 4), which advanced from Woodstock to Portsmouth, and was engaged in several skirmishes with the adherents of the royal governor, Dunmore, who, in the meantime, had fled the capital and taken refuge on an English ship. Early in the following summer, Clark marched with Muhlenberg's regiment and other troops to Charleston, South Carolina, at which place they arrived on the 24th of June, and were at once involved in the important military movements then going on at that place and vicinity. He continued there until in August when he was ordered further south, and at Savannah was seized with dangerous illness which so prostrated him that, for a long time, he was unable to perform military service, and returned home on furlough in the autumn of that year. When about recovered from this long protracted sickness in the spring of 1777, he had the misfortune to be taken down with the smallpox, which again disabled him for a considerable period. As soon as his health permitted, he returned to the army under Washington, then at Bound Brook encampment, and with the Eighth Virginia Regiment, in the brigade of General Charles Scott, participated in the battles of Brandywine and Germantown, and aided in breaking the British right wing in the latter battle. He was also in the battle of Monmouth in 1778, and in 1779 served with great distinction in the surprise of the enemy at Paulus Hook, on which important occasion he was second in command, having been previously promoted to be a major by congress. One hundred and fifty-nine of the enemy were captured in this affair, with a loss to the Americans of only two killed and three wounded. So important was the result that General Washington hastened to communicate it to Congress in a manner highly complimentary. He said \\"that a remarkable degree of prudence, address, enterprise and bravery was displayed on the occasion, which does the highest honor to all the officers and men engaged in it, and that the situation of the fort rendered the attempt critical and the success brilliant.\\" Congress returned thanks and ordered a gold medal to be made in honor of the event, and fifteen thousand dollars to be distributed among the rank and file who participated in the enterprise. Major Clark was highly complimented in letters from Lord Sterling and other officers, and in November following congress promoted him to be a lieutenant-colonel, to date from the previous May. In the following winter Clark and the Virginia regiment to which he belonged, together with other troops, marched through terrible hardships to the south, reaching the Siege of Charleston in the last of March, 1780, where they encountered still further trials and sufferings, until finally, on the 12th of May, the American army, then under command of General Benjamin Lincoln, was compelled to surrender to the enemy. Colonel Clark was held a prisoner in Charleston until the spring of 1781, when he was paroled and returned to Virginia, but he was not formally exchanged until after the surrender of Lord Cornwallis. Abraham Bowman was the colonel of the eighth Virginia regiment of which Clark was the lieutenant- colonel, and he was also the first cousin of an attractive young lady residing in Frederick county, Virginia, named Sarah Hite. She was the daughter of Isaac Hite, Sr., and granddaughter of Jost Hite, and her brother Isaac Hite, Jr., was likewise a major in the Revolutionary army. The friendship existing between the two comrades-in-arms led to an acquaintance between Colonel Clark and Miss Hite, which resulted in their marriage February 13, 1782. He settled for a time in Spottsylvania county, and was commissioned a major-general of the Virginia militia in 1793. But his thoughts now turned to the great west, and in 1802 he joined his distinguished brother, General George Rogers Clark at the falls of the Ohio, settling finally at Trough Spring, near Louisville, Kentucky. Here he devoted himself to business with great success, accumulating a large fortune in real estate as well as personal property. The inventory of the latter, returned by Abraham Hite, his wife's cousin, and John H. Clark, his son, his administrators, covers eleven pages of book of inventories No. 2, Jefferson county, Kentucky. A glance over the long list shows that fifty-six of his slaves were mentioned by name. The following notice of General Jonathan Clark's death appeared in the Western Sun, published at Vincennes, December 14, 1811: \\"Another Revolutionary hero is gone--Died at his seat near Louisville, Kentucky, on Monday, the 25th ult. (November, 1811), General Jonathan Clark--He supped with his family on the 24th, retired at his accustomed hour to rest, and in the morning was found numbered with the dead.\\" Sarah Hite was the younger by some eight years and survived him about that time. They are resting side by side in Cave Hill Cemetery. References Based on Conquest of the Country Northwest of the River Ohio 1778 - 1783 and Life of Gen.

Aland assigned it to Category II in Catholic epistles, and to Category III elsewhere. Textually it is very close to the codex 322, as a sister manuscript. It is a member of the textual family 1739. In Acts 8:37 it has an additional verse together with the manuscripts Codex Laudianus, 453, 945, 1739, 1891, 2818 (formerly 36a), and several others.Nestle-Aland, Novum Testamentum Graece, 26th edition, p. 345; Bruce M. Metzger, A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament (Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft: Stuttgart 2001), p. 316. In Acts 8:39 it has addition (the holy spirit fell on the eunuch, and an angel caught up Philip). This reading is supported by the manuscripts Codex Alexandrinus, 453, 945, 1739, 1891, 2818, itp, vg, syrh, and several others.  History  The manuscript was brought from Greece. It was examined by Mill, Griesbach, and Scholz. C. R. Gregory saw it in 1883. Formerly it was designated by 29a and 35p. In 1908 Gregory gave the number 323 to it. The manuscript is currently housed in the Bibliothèque de Genève (Gr. 20) in Geneva.

Paris: Société des Ecrivains, 2010 (pp. 47, 64) It is based on the Japanese Pocket Zaurus toyline from Bandai.http://www.collect-all.net/t15457-pocket- zaurus-ou-les-origines-des-diplodo  Plot  The series Diplodo focuses on five dinosaur-like creatures, known as the diplodorians. These creatures are from Diplodorianrex, the sister planet of Earth, which lies in the fourth dimension. The story explains that whatever happens to one planet also affects the other planet. The Diplodos have successfully defended their home planet and put up a strong defensive shield. This results in the Diplidos' enemies, led by the evil Santos, targeting Earth in order to destroy the Diplodos' home planet. With this threat, the five chosen Diplodos travel to Earth in order to defend the planet, which will result in saving their own. Here, they meet and become allies with two children, Peter and Joan. Characters The Diplodos *Bubbles – A pink hippo-like diplodorian. He is the leader of the Diplodos, he can produce bubbles from his mouth; capable of transporting human beings and possibly an evolved Tyrannosaurus. He is voiced by Arthur Grosser. *Puncher – A purple diplodorian who can punch holes through any material using his teeth and possibly an evolved Heterodontosaurus. He is voiced by Rick Jones. *Scissors – A yellow Pterosaur-like diplodorian who can slice objects using his mouth like a pair of scissors and is possibly an evolved Pteranodon. *Stapler – A blue walrus-like diplodorian who can produce staples from his mouth and is shown to be an evolved Triceratops. *Stickum – An orange Stegosaur-like diplodorian who can produce sellotape from his mouth, useful for repairing holes or tying up enemies and possibly an evolved Stegosaurus. The children *Peter – A young boy who is an ally and friend to the Diplodos. Peter has brown hair and is interested in dinosaurs. *Joan – A young girl who is an ally and friend to the Diplodos. Joan has blonde hair and enjoys playing soccer. Enemies *Santos – The evil enemy of the Diplodos. He is a Earthling traitor who works to with the Zodarians to destroy the Earth. He wears a suit of power armour with a laser gun on its wrist. He is voiced by A. J. Henderson. *Zodarians - A species of green-skinned aliens who serve the Great Sorcerer and are commanded by Santos. Like Santos, they wear suits of power armour with built-in laser cannons. *The Great Sorcerer - A powerful villain imprisoned on Diplodorianrex. He can send commands to Santos and the Zodarians through telepathy. He desires the destruction of Earth (and thus, Diplodorianrex) so he can escape and lead the Zodarians to conquer the galaxy.

T. (2006) \\"Trauma, disease and collateral damage: conflict in cimicids,\\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 361, 269–275.) is a special-purpose organ found in bed bugs that appears to have evolved to mitigate the effects of traumatic insemination. The spermalege has two embryologically distinct parts, known as the ectospermalege and mesospermalege.Reinhardt, K., Naylor, R. & Siva-Jothy, M. T. (2003) \\"Reducing a cost of traumatic insemination: female bedbugs evolve a unique organ,\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society B, 270, 2371–2375. The evolution of the spermalege as a female counter-adaptation for traumatic insemination was first proposed by Jacques Carayon in 1966.Carayon, J. (1966) Traumatic insemination and the paragenital system. In Monograph of Cimicidae (Hemiptera—Heteroptera) (ed. R. L. Usinger), pp. 81–166. College Park, MD: Entomological Society of America. Structure The spermalege has two embryologically distinct parts, known as the ectospermalege and mesospermalege. The ectospermalege is derived from the ectoderm. It consists of a groove in the right-handed posterior margin of the fifth sclerite, overlying a pleural membrane. In order to access the female's haemocoel during traumatic insemination, male bed bugs insert their needle-like penisRyne, C. (2009) \\"Homosexual interactions in bed bugs: alarm pheromones as male recognition signals,\\" Animal Behaviour, 78, 1471–1475. into the groove, and pierce the pleural membrane. This piercing produces wounds that leave melanised scars. The mesospermalege is derived from the mesoderm. It is a membrane-bound sac attached to the wall of the haemocoel, directly beneath the groove of the ectospermalege. In all bed bug species except Primicimex cavernis, sperm are injected into the mesospermalege.Reinhardt, K. & Siva- Jothy, M. T. (2007) \\"Biology of the bed bugs (Cimicidae),\\" Annual Review of Entomology, 52, 351–374. The structure contains two main types of hemocyte, though their function is not yet fully understood. The first of these is phagocytic and may absorb seminal fluid, whereas the other may digest spermatozoa. Function The ectospermalege is visible externally in most bed bug species, giving the male a target through which to impale the female. In species without an externally visible ectospermalege, traumatic insemination takes place over a wide range of the body surface. > Exactly why males 'comply' with this aspect of female control over the site > of mating is unclear, especially as male P. cavernis appear to be able to > penetrate the abdomen at a number of points independent of the presence of > an ectospermalege. One possibility is that mating outside the ectospermalege > reduces female fecundity to such an extent that the mating male's paternity > is significantly reduced ... The ectospermalege appears to act as a mating > guide, directing the male's copulatory interest, and therefore damage, to a > restricted area of the female's abdomen. The spermalege structure serves to reduce the wounding and immunological costs of traumatic insemination. The piercing wound typically occurs in the exocuticle of the mesospermalege, and is repaired by \\"scarring substance\\" developed in the epidermis. At least nine species of bacteria and fungi have been identified from the male intromittent organ, and the mesospermalege reduces the likelihood of infection from such pathogenic organisms.

Synopsis  A free and compassionate human spirit is trapped in Shibu, an eleven-year-old boy. In order to guide Shibu's wandering energy on a constructive path, his widow mother sends him to the city from the village, with his uncle. But Shibu's carefree approach to life and his energetic response to reality, makes him a subject of annoyance to the neighbour as well as his own aunt. This forces his uncle to be strict with him and he takes him along to his shoe shop, in order to keep a watch on him, studying. But the situation leads Shibu on a different track. Being asked by the Uncle to carry a pair of shoes to a doctor's residence, Shibu ventures across the streets and lanes in his casual and carefree manner while encountering some stray incidents. But, then something very sudden and unpredictable happens, which invites him to show his true potential and real merit, to surprise the adults, effected by indifferent attitude.

Review A. K. Bir too has a child protagonist in Baaja. Shibu is brought from the village to the town to be better educated. The boy's encounters and adventures on the streets bring out his savvy nature and concern for others; they also give him a better understanding of values. Shibu gives first aid to a grandma who has been cudgelled by a thief, minds the wailing baby, finds a doctor, and recovers the stolen gold chain. Since Bir is unable to decide whether to opt for realism or the fairy tale mode, the film hangs uneasily between the two genres. http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2002100401310100.htm&date;=2002/10/04/&prd;=fr& See also National Film Award for Best Children's Film  References External links * *Interview of 'A.K.Bir'in www.filmnirvana.com Category:2002 films Category:Indian films Category:Indian children's films Category:2000s Hindi-language films Category:Best Children's Film National Film Award winners Category:2000s children's films ","title":"Baaja"},{"id":"21774965","text":"Clarksville is a community in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, located in the Municipal District of East Hants in Hants County.

(formerly 1Up Yours, Listen Up!, 4 Guys 1 Up, In This Thread) is a weekly gaming podcast released every Friday by 1Up.com. History1UP Yours= 1UP Yours was a weekly podcast show that takes the form of a discussion among several editors from the 1UP network. The radio show began October 21, 2005 as a weekly news show hosted by Jane Pinckard. As with The 1UP Show, the 1UP Yours podcast gradually became a more complex and organized radio show. Topics of the podcast included press announcements, news from gaming conferences, and discussion of game design. The show was hosted for its duration by Garnett Lee and was recorded and edited by Andrew Pfister. The original 1UP Yours logo Whenever there was a vacancy in the show's lineup of regular hosts, the unoccupied positions would be filled by guests to the show, usually other writers and editors from the 1UP Network. There were also instances in which an industry guest from outside of Ziff Davis appeared as a guest on the program. The initial four-man lineup included Lee and Shane Bettenhausen, as well as Luke Smith and John Davison. However, Smith later left the network to accept a position at the then-Microsoft game development studio Bungie. On August 24, 2007, Mark MacDonald was declared the show's official \\"fourth chair\\" member. John Davison then announced that he was leaving the 1UP staff, though he would continue his participation with the podcast despite his change in career. On the October 19th episode, Mark MacDonald announced he would be leaving the show. On the February 1st, 2008 episode, it was announced that GFW editor Shawn Elliott would be filling MacDonald's now-vacant hosting duties. Bryan Intihar was confirmed as the third chair on the January 18th episode of 2008, but left the show shortly after on March 7 after he took a job with developer Insomniac Games. The last officially branded 1UP Yours was recorded on January 17, 2009 and was released on January 22, 2009. =Listen UP= After the purchase of 1UP by UGO production all 1UP podcasts were suspended. During the purchase there were many layoffs including chair and producer Andrew Pfister along with longtime chair and executive editor of 1UP, Shane Bettenhausen. After weeks of emails and suggestions, a new show launched on January 30, 2009 called Listen UP. On September 30, 2009, Garnett Lee announced he would be leaving 1UP to become the editorial director for Gamefly Media. It was replaced by \\"4 Guys 1UP\\" hosted by former fourth chair David Ellis, which is quite different in format than Lee's shows. Lee stated he will create a new show for Gamefly Media (eventually titled Weekend Confirmed ). 4 Guys 1UP The newly titled flagship podcast debuted on October 23, 2009. The new format featured David Ellis as host, joined each week by two other 1UP editors, and a special guest each week in the \\"fourth chair\\", usually from the game development industry. The format of the show has changed, with new segments focused on interviewing the week's guests, and tweaked versions of headlines, and \\"Whatchya been playin'?\\" David Ellis announced that he would be leaving 1UP on the 03/05/2010 podcast. The podcast was replaced by Ray Barnholt's \\"In This Thread\\", which in turn was replaced by \\"Games, Dammit!\\". Format Generally, the program begins with \\"Whatcha been playing?\\", in which the editors discuss games they are currently playing for fun or, as is more often the case, games they are either reviewing or are previewing. The second portion of the podcast will typically begin with a report on some of the recent activity on the 1UP message boards. This segment is followed by a more focused feature, which may include a more in-depth discussion on a particular topic (such as reactions to new system launches or the concept of micro-transactions in games) or quasi- regular features such as the Four-Minute Warning, during which the hosts are presented with several gaming-related questions submitted by listeners; they are then given four minutes to discuss. Once the four minutes are up, they move on to the next question. The third segment reviews the news from the past week, complete with reactions from the editors after each topic is brought up. Occasionally, guests from the industry, including Cliff Bleszinski and Mark Rein from Epic Games, Ted Price from Insomniac Games, Dennis Dyack from Silicon Knights, and Lorne Lanning creator of the Oddworld series will visit the show to discuss their various products or just participate in the program itself. The podcast usually lasts about two hours, and is recorded on Thursdays, with the podcast publishing every Friday. Lineup Beginning in January 2006, Garnett Lee took the reins of the main 1UP podcast, with Andrew Pfister as the producer. It was renamed from \\"This Week at 1UP\\" to 1UP Yours. After a few shows, John Davison, then Editorial Director of the 1UP network, joined Garnett as Co-Host. Each week, guests would join Garnett and Davison. In April 2006, the new 1UP News Editor Luke Smith joined as well as Shane Bettanhausen, the first show the four did together was well received and became the permanent line-up. During this period John Davison would do the message board segment and Smith would handle the news segment. Mark MacDonald was the special fill-in chair if one of the four could not be there. After April 2007, Luke Smith left 1UP to join Bungie as community manager. Mark MacDonald took the newly opened fourth chair. MacDonald left shortly after. Davison then left a few weeks later to create What They Play. Soon afterward, Bryan Intihar joined and Shawn Elliott from Games for Windows Magazine and GFW Radio joined a few weeks later. After a short stay on 1UP Yours, Bryan Intihar left 1UP to join Insomniac Games to work as community manager for Resistance 2. On the June 7, 2008, Lee announced that Shawn Elliott had left 1UP Yours to become exclusive to GFW Radio due to workload and schedule issues. It was also announced that longtime producer Andrew Pfister would join the cast in a speaking role, with John Davison returning permanently after a few guest appearances. On January 6, 2009, it was announced that Ziff Davis would be selling 1UP.com to the Hearst Corporation, in the process terminating Electronic Gaming Monthly and over 30 employees, including Shane Bettenhausen and Andrew Pfister. In the wake of the announcement the future of 1UP Yours was uncertain. On January 16, Garnett Lee confirmed the continuation of the series with a new cast consisting of John Davison, David Ellis, and Garnett Lee and (eventually) new regular addition Sam Kennedy.

He made just one appearance in his debut season, at South Melbourne, which prompted him to cross to Richmond where he added only three more matches. When the war ended he tried to make a career in the league again and lined up for Melbourne in the 1919 season, rucking regularly for them during his four years at the club. He made a return to South Melbourne in 1923, joining Roy Cazaly in the ruck and he played in a losing preliminary final.

It was produced by DiverseWorks for Infernal Bridegroom Productions, and premiered at the DiverseWorks Artspace in Houston, Texas on February 24, 2000.Parks, Suzan L. The Red Letter Plays. New York: Theatre Communications Group, 2001. (P. 114) Background Fucking A is inspired by the novel The Scarlet Letter, written by Nathaniel Hawthorne in 1850. Fucking A shares several similarities with this work; both of the main characters are named Hester and are strong females with an unwavering love for their illegitimate child. Both Hesters also bear the letter “A” as a symbol of how society defines them: the modern Hester is an abortionist, the original is branded for adultery. The idea for the play came to Parks while she was canoeing with a friend, when Parks yelled out, \\"I'm going to write a play, a riff on The Scarlet Letter, and I'm going to call it 'Fucking A'. Ha, ha, ha!\\" While Parks was initially joking, she couldn't get the idea out of her mind. She began working on the play, but after 4 years of drafts and rewrites she still hadn't come up with a workable plot. She threw out everything except the title and the name Hester, and considered throwing out the latter as well, but the voice of Hester filled her mind and persuaded her to retain it and write Hester's story. In the Blood Hester's story, however, was not called \\"Fucking A\\", but In the Blood; a contemporized version of Puritan adultery and guilt, about Hester La Negrita and her struggle to survive in a world filled with sexual oppression, along with her five children, all by different fathers. “You have to listen to those voices when they talk to you,” said Parks. Once it was finished, she was then able to go back and write all of Fucking A, which she refers to as a \\"revenge tragedy\\" about abortionist Hester Smith.Parks, Suzan L. \\"The Power and Audacity of Spoken Black English.\\" Interview. Academy of Achievement. 10 Oct. 2007. 12 Feb. 2009 <>. Plot synopsis While In the Blood took place in a contemporary urban world, Fucking A has no such identifiable historical grounding. Set in \\"a small town in a small country in the middle of nowhere,\\" it is a dark fable worthy of John Webster and other Jacobean tragedies. Ms. Parks composed brief sardonic songs in the style of Kurt Weill for her characters, with such titles as \\"Working Woman's Song\\" and \\"My Little Army.\\" The world revealed in the play is bleak and dystopian; one of naked and sadistic power where its subjects are subject to arbitrary imprisonment, where sexuality and fertility are discussed in an alternate language (translated on over-stage screens). Hester Smith is an abortionist, physically branded with the letter “A.” The play begins with Hester talking to her friend \\"Canary Mary\\" about her son \\"Boy,\\" whom she has not seen for 20 years after he was imprisoned as a child for stealing a piece of meat from the Rich Family. The \\"rich bitch\\" who denounced him has grown up to marry the \\"Mayor,\\" who is the head of state. Hester describes how she writes to her son and how she is saving her fees to pay for an outing with him (\\"Working Womans Song\\"). Canary, who is the Mayor's mistress, discloses that the Mayor's Wife, the First Lady, isn't able to bear a child. The Mayor is ready to have her quietly killed so he can take a more fertile wife, and Canary is confident that he will choose her. Before Canary leaves, she gives Hester a gold coin, enough money for Hester to finally have a picnic with her son. In the next scene, the First Lady mourns over her period as it proves, once again, that she is not pregnant. The Mayor assures her that the problem is entirely on her as he is perfectly capable (\\"My Little Army\\"). The First Lady, desperate for the Mayor's love, begs him to try one more time. He begrudgingly agrees, and the scene ends with the First Lady passionately kissing her dispassionate and disinterested husband. Meanwhile, Hester meets with the Freedom Fund to arrange the meeting with her son. The Freedom Fund lady informs Hester that Boy's \\"picnic price\\" has doubled because he's continued to commit more crimes in prison. She reveals that Boy's initial three-year sentence has \\"doubled and tripled and quadrupled\\" during his incarceration, a sign that he is a \\"hardened criminal.\\" Hester disagrees, saying her son is an angel and that she must have miscalculated his picnic price. Later, Canary Mary walks through a park where she meets an escaped convict, \\"Monster.\\" He hits on her, but she rejects his advances. She notices he has a scar on his arm, and after a few exchanged words, she continues on her way. The scene changes to a bar where three hunters are bragging about torturing and killing an escaped convict (\\"The Hunters Creed\\"). They laugh about torturing the man and lament that he wasn't a famous convict like the escaped Monster. \\"Butcher\\" engages with them, sharing a knife catalog and discussing the different blades. As the Hunters drink, Hester arrives at the bar to find \\"Scribe,\\" so he can write a new letter to send her son. She and the Hunters share a moment of tension before Butcher breaks it, sending the drunk Scribe back to his business. In the following scene, Canary Mary angrily tells the Mayor she wants him to finally marry her. He deflects by saying after he murders (and subsequently mourns) her death, \\"the people\\" will want him to marry a woman of class instead of a whore. He then offers Canary gold as a way of placating her, and Canary laments the loss of her freedom in exchange for comfort (\\"Gilded Cage\\"). During the next interlude, Monster meets an emotionally broken First Lady in the park. They exchange some kind words, and, in the end, she asks if she can kiss him. Butcher visits Hester. While Hester thinks his visit is to collect on a debt, Butcher instead simply wants to talk. He reveals that his daughter, like Hester's Boy, is in jail for a long list of offenses. He then shows her a technique for slitting a pig's throat that is completely painless and has her practice the move until she gets it just right. After Hester offers to show him her gold coin, he tells her he wants to marry her. She responds by saying he could never love her branded \\"A\\" or the job it represents, but he simply says \\"loving anything is hard.\\" They end the scene holding hands. The next day, Hester awakes to find Monster has broken into her home. He robs her of some of her money but sees the scar on her arm. He realizes that she is his mother but doesn't tell her, running off instead. The next day, Hester finally has enough for her to pay for a furloughed picnic with her son. As she lays out the picnic spread, the guard brings out a prisoner called \\"Jailbait,\\" who Hester ecstatically assumes is her son. She embraces him and tries to get him to show her the scar she gave him on his arm when he was first taken away to prison, but he is more interested in the food than in her. Halfway through the meal, Hester realizes Jailbait is not her son. Jailbait claims that he killed her son in prison (\\"My Vengeance\\"). As Hester is frozen with shock, Jailbait begins to rape her. Part Two begins with Monster and the First Lady in the park. She is holding her stomach, and Monster assumes he impregnated her. He demands she give him 10,000 coins to help him live the life he feels he deserves. The First Lady suddenly realizes that this is the escaped convict the Hunters are looking for. She tells him she'll turn him in, but he responds that he'll kill her first. As she runs off, he asks again if he got her pregnant. During the next scene, the First Lady goes to Hester to get an abortion, fearing the child is Monster's instead of the Mayor's. She meets two other women waiting for Hester and realizes that, whoever the father is, she can pass the baby off as the Mayor's (\\"My Little Enemy\\"). She gives money to the waiting women and leaves. Hester, enraged over the death of her son and the rape she experienced, is now bent on revenge against the First Lady. She devises a plan with Canary to kill the First Lady that night, utilizing Butcher's unwitting help. In a brief interlude, the Hunters talk about getting closer to Monster based on an \\"anonymous tip\\" presumably given to them by the First Lady and a \\"piece of his shirt\\" possibly given to them by Canary Mary. Hester goes to see Butcher in an effort to convince him to help her kidnap the First Lady. While she is there, the Mayor visits Butcher and reveals the First Lady is pregnant. Hester, realizing a new opportunity, changes her plan. Butcher continues to ask Hester to marry him (\\"A Meat Man Is a Good Man to Marry\\"), but she insists that he help her \\"talk\\" to the First Lady before she can marry him. He agrees. The ensemble sings \\"Hard Times.\\" As Hester waits for Canary Mary and Butcher to bring the First Lady, Monster returns. He claims to be a newly released prisoner who knew her son and wants to return some of Boy's things. Hester realizes that Monster is the convict everyone is looking for and starts to panic. Monster tries to tell her that he is Boy, her son, but Hester refuses to listen. She points a gun at him, and he leaves. Canary Mary and Butcher enter with a drugged and confused First Lady. Butcher is concerned, but Hester reassures him everything is fine and takes the First Lady into the back. Canary Mary keeps Butcher distracted as Hester performs an abortion on the First Lady, not knowing that she is, in fact, aborting her own grandchild. Hester emerges from the back triumphant, covered in blood. Canary Mary tells her that she will have to keep her distance to avoid suspicion. Hester grabs Butcher's hand as he leaves, but he removes his hand from hers and slowly wipes the blood off his own hands before leaving. Just after Butcher and Canary leave, Monster runs into the house. He's been badly wounded by the hunters and is looking for a safe place to hide. Hester accepts that Monster is actually her son. As the barking of the Hunters’ dogs grow louder, Monster begs Hester to kill him. He tells her that the Hunters will torture him to death if she doesn't save him now. She refuses, asking him how he turned from her Boy into Monster. He tells her it wasn't hard, that he \\"made something of myself\\" (\\"The Making of a Monster\\"). Hester finally decides to save him from torture. She slits his throat like Butcher taught her to, and Monster dies in her arms. The Hunters enter and see that he is already dead. Although they are disappointed, they drag his body away because there is “still fun to be had.”Parks, Suzan L. The Red Letter Plays. New York: Theatre Communications Group, 2001. (P. 220) Hester stands alone in her house, but only has a moment before her bell rings. She gets her abortion tools and continues her work.

Character Analysis The story centers on Hester the abortion provider. She works as an abortion provider for the “Rich People”, as she calls them.Parks, Suzan L. The Red Letter Plays. New York: Theatre Communications Group, 2001. (P. 148) Her son was sent to prison by the First Lady, who is a very rich woman. This shows that Hester is a poor woman who seems to live in an oppressed world. The playwright never suggests it in the writing, but Hester is mostly likely an African-American woman living during the racist era of America. Racism isn't evident in the play, but when Hester continually talks about how she has to work for the “Rich People”, it's easy to relate that time period. Hester in herself is a strong and determined woman, and even though working as an Abortionist is a disgraced occupation, she continues to do it just to see her son again. She loves him so much that at the end of the play, she is able to save him pain by killing him. Monster is someone who seems like a kid who was at the wrong place at the wrong time. Granted he does eventually become more of a criminal as time passes (he robs Hester and threatens the First Lady), it seems like if he hadn't been sent to prison that he would’ve grown up a good kid under the guidance of his mother. The prisons of course had changed his perspective on life. “Better a monster than a boy. I made something of myself. It wasn’t hard”.Parks, Suzan L. The Red Letter Plays. New York: Theatre Communications Group, 2001. (P. 218) If only he could’ve grown up into something better than a monster. The First Lady is Hester's archenemy and almost complete opposite. She sent Hester's son to prison, but Hester is working on getting her son out. The First Lady is unable to bear children, so no matter how much money she has, she is unable to do what a poor woman like Hester can do. The Mayor is displeased with her inability and openly cheats on her with Canary Mary. The First Lady can see that she will be replaced and her world is crashing down on her. She spirals into depression and in her angst she actually gets impregnated by the same man she sent to prison, Monster. She wants to abort the baby, so the thing she found so disgraceful in the first place, she sees as something she must do. She can be seen as the woman with the money and no love in her life, while Hester has numerous people who love her, but very little money. Genre The play is full of dark humor, although it is influenced by the structure of classic tragedy. Style Fucking A is without a doubt largely an expressionism piece because of its own characteristics. It's a dark and repressive world and Hester is trapped in her own society because of her lack of wealth and the fact that she's an Abortionist. The entire play has an abstract feel to it, and also goes from a normal state to a nightmare state. The names of the characters are also very generic, such as Monster, Mayor, Jail Bait, etc. The amount of blood that's in the play, as well as the amount of rape and death can easily be interpreted as a dark world and a dark distorted mind. It is a fairly short play and it follows Hester's quest/journey to see her son again. It's not only a look into Hester's state of mind and emotion, but the playwright's as well.Rush, David. A Student Guide to Play Analysis. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 2005. (P. 216-229) Language Suzan-Lori Parks created a separate type of language called \\"Talk\\". It is used only by the women in the play. The women who speak in \\"Talk\\" also speak English, but use \\"Talk\\" when they are talking about pregnancy or vaginas. Here is an example of \\"Talk\\":Parks, Suzan L. The Red Letter Plays. New York: Theatre Communications Group, 2001. (P. 119) Canary:Die la-sah Chung-chung?

February 12, 2009 Theme/Idea The overall theme or idea of the play is the mother's love for a child. Hester is an Abortionist; so every day, she has women who come in to rid themselves of an unwanted child. She's helping women who don't have enough love for their child, all the while she is scrapping and saving everything she can just to have a small picnic with her son. The collection agency tells her she has to pay double to see him now, and it doesn't even faze her. She continues to work towards her goal because she loves her son so much. Women are coming into her work to kill their sons, while Hester kills for her son. She aborts the First Lady's unborn child because of how she put her son in jail. In the end is the true test of how much Hester loves her son. He begs her to kill him in order to save himself from torture, and of course at first she is reluctant. Ultimately her strong love for him is the only thing that enables her to kill him to save him from pain. She was once a woman who aborted other women's children, finally it comes around full circle that she has to abort her own child. Music Suzan-Lori Parks wrote numerous songs for this play. Just about every character has a song that expresses something about themselves. Hester has a song called “My Vengeance” and even the Hunters have a song called “The Hunters Creed”. These songs are often sung during a scene where the character will break off and sing. It adds an interesting emotional element to the play and also shows off Park's musical and lyrical ability. Here is one of the songs from the play: _Monster: “The Making of a Monster”_ : “Youd think it'd be hard : To make something horrid : Its easy. : Youd think it would take : So much work to create : The Devil Incarnate : Its easy. : The smallest seed grows to a tree : A grain of sand pearls in an oyster : A small bit of hate in a heart will inflate : And that’s more so much more than enough : To make you a Monster. : Youd think itd be hard : To make something horrid : Its easy.” Productions ;PremiereParks.2C_Suzan_L_2001._P._114 Fucking A was originally produced by DiverseWorks for Infernal Bridgegroom Productions on February 24, 2000, in Houston, Texas.

About the author Suzan-Lori Parks is an award-winning female American playwright who was born in 1964 in Fort Knox, Kentucky. For her undergraduate degree she studied English and graduated with honors in 1985 from Mount Holyoke College. Also in 1985, under the encouragement of writer James Baldwin (who she studied with), she created her first ever play called The Sinners Place. “He had faith in me long before I even had faith in me,” she said.Marshall, John. \\"A moment with ...

The College of Charleston. 12 Feb. 2009 <>. Being an African-American, Parks often wrote plays that related to class struggle and race. Some plays were controversial such as The Death of the Last Black Man in the Whole Entire World. However “critics applauded Parks's use of history, language and stereotype.” In turn she received a National Endowment for the Arts Playwriting Fellow for it. Not only writing plays she also produced a film called Anemone Me. Parks also writes the music for some of her plays herself, such as Fucking A and In the Blood. “I write because I love black people.

The Tableau économique () or Economic Table is an economic model first described by French economist François Quesnay in 1758, which laid the foundation of the Physiocratic school of economics.Henry William Spiegel (1983) The Growth of Economic Thought, Revised and Expanded Edition, Duke University Press. p.189 Quesnay believed that trade and industry were not sources of wealth, and instead in his 1758 manuscript Tableau économique (Economic Table) argued that agricultural surpluses, by flowing through the economy in the form of rent, wages, and purchases were the real economic movers.  The model  The model Quesnay created consisted of three economic movers. The \\"Proprietary\\" class consisted of only landowners. The \\"Productive\\" class consisted of all agricultural laborers. The \\"Sterile\\" class is made up of artisans and merchants. The flow of production and/or cash between the three classes started with the Proprietary class because they own the land and they buy from both of the other classes. The process has these steps (consult Figure 1). #The farmer produces 1,500 food on land leased from the landlord. Of that 1,500, he retains 600 food to feed himself, his livestock, and any laborers he hires. He sells the remaining 900 in the market for $1 per unit of food. He keeps $300 ($150 for himself, $150 for his laborer) to buy non-farm goods (clothes, household goods, etc.) from the merchants and artisans. This produces $600 of net profit, to which Quesnay refers as product net. #The artisan produces 750 units of crafts. To produce at that level, he needs 300 units of food and 150 units of foreign goods. He also has subsistence need of 150 units of food and 150 units of crafts to keep himself alive during the year. The total is 450 units of food, 150 units of crafts, and 150 units of foreign goods. He buys $450 of food from the farmer and $150 of goods from the merchant, and he sells 600 units of crafts at the market for $600. Because the artisan must use the cash he made selling his crafts to buy raw materials for the next year’s production, he has no net profit. #The landlord is only a consumer of food and crafts and produces no product. His contribution to the production process is the redistribution of $600 in land rent the farmer pays for the use of naturally occurring land. The landlord uses $300 of the rent to buy food from the farmer in the market and $300 to buy crafts from the artisan. Because he is purely a consumer, Quesnay considers the landlord the prime mover of economic activity. It is his desire to consume which causes him to expend his entire lease income on food and crafts and which provides income to the other classes. #The merchant is the mechanism for exporting food in exchange for foreign imports. The merchant uses the $150 he received from the artisan to buy food from the market, and it is assumed that he takes the food out of the country to exchange it for more foreign goods. : 600px :Figure 1 Production Flow Diagram for Quesnay's Tableau (4) The Tableau shows the reason why the Physiocrats disagreed with Cantillon about exporting food. The economy produces a surplus of food, and neither the farmer nor the artisan can afford to consume more than a subsistence level of food. The landlord is assumed to be consuming at a level of satiation; therefore, he cannot consume any more. Since food cannot be stored easily, it is necessary to sell it to someone who can use it. This is where the merchant provides value.  Physiocratic interpretation  The merchant is not a source of wealth, however. The Physiocrats believed that “neither industry nor commerce generates wealth.”Charbit and Virmani (2002) p.858 A “plausible explanation is that the Physiocrats developed their theory in light of the actual situation of the French economy…” France was an absolute monarchy with the land owners constituting 6-8% of the population and owning 50% of the land. (5, p. 859) Agriculture contributes 80% of the country’s wealth, and the non-land owning segment of the population “practises a subsistence agriculture that produces the essential minimum, with virtually all income being absorbed by food requirements.”Charbit and Virmani (2002) p.859 Additionally, exports consisted mostly of agricultural-based products, e.g. wine. Given the massive effect of agriculture on France’s economy, it was more likely they would develop an economic model that used it to the king’s advantage. The Physiocrats are at the beginning of the anti-mercantilist movement. Quesnay’s argument against industry and international trade as alternatives to his doctrine is twofold. First, industry produces no gain in wealth; therefore, redirecting labor from agriculture to industry will in effect decrease the nation’s overall wealth. Additionally, population expands to fill available land and food supply; therefore, population must go down if the use of land does not produce food. Second, the basic premise of the Mercantilists is that a country must export more than it imports to gain wealth, but that assumes it has more of a tradeable resource than it needs for internal consumption. France did not have a colony with the ability to produce finished or semi-finished goods like England (e.g. India) or Holland (e.g. North America, Africa, South America). Its main colonial presence was in the Caribbean, southern North America, and southeast Asia, and like France, the colonies had agricultural-based economies. The only good which France had in enough excess to export was food; therefore, international trade based on industrial production would not yield as much wealth. Quesnay was not anti-industry, however. He was just realistic in his assessment that France was not in good position to incubate a strong industrial market. His argument was that artisans and manufacturers would come to France only in proportion to the size of the internal market for their goods.Mueller (1978) p.153 Quesnay believed “a country should concentrate on manufacturing only to the extent that the local availability of raw materials and suitable labor enabled it to have a cost advantage over its overseas competitors.” Anything above that amount should be purchased through trade.  Legacy  The tableau économique is credited as the \\"first precise formulation\\" of interdependent systems in economics and the origin of the theory of the multiplier in economics.The multiplier theory, by Hugo Hegeland, 1954, p. 1 An analogous table is used in the theory of money creation under fractional-reserve banking by relending of deposits, leading to the money multiplier. The wage-fund doctrine was derived from the tableau, then later rejected. Karl Marx used Quesnay's Tableau as a basis for his theory of circulation in Capital volume 2.

Unusually, neither piece carries a dedication. This set of nocturnes was originally considered to be one of the better sets, yet its popularity slowly decreased in the twentieth century. Blair Johnson maintains, however, that the pieces are still \\"wonderful specimens, being something of a hybrid between the more dramatic Opus 27 and the far simpler textures and moods of Opus 32.\\" Robert Schumann commented that they were \\"of that nobler kind under which poetic ideality gleams more transparently.\\" Schumann also said that the \\"two nocturnes differ from his earlier ones chiefly through greater simplicity of decoration and more quiet grace.\\"Huneker (1966), p. 262 Gustav Barth commented that Chopin's nocturnes are definite signs of \\"progress\\" in comparison to John Field's original nocturnes, though the improvements are \\"for the most part only in technique.\\" However, David Dubal feels that the pieces are \\"more aptly described as ballades in miniature.\\"  No. 1, in G minor  The Nocturne in G minor is initially marked as andante sostenuto and is in 4/4 meter. In measure 41, the key changes to E-flat major and returns to G minor in measure 67. The piece is a total of 91 measures long, ending with a Picardy third, and is in ternary form. One of Chopin's students once claimed that Chopin himself forgot to mark the increase in tempo for the chorale, which led to the section being played too slowly.Huneker (1966), p. 261 James Friskin commented that the nocturne is \\"one of the simpler nocturnes\\" and is similar to the Nocturne in G minor, Op. 15, No. 3 in that it \\"has similar legato chord passages in the contrasting section\\" though this nocturne \\"has a more ornamental melodic line\\". Dubal also agreed that the nocturne is \\"of lesser importance.\\"Dubal (2004), p. 464 Critics, however, have often pointed to the potential allusion to religion in the middle section. Maurycy Karasowski commented that the middle section has \\"a church-like atmosphere in chords.\\" Johnson also thought the chords to be \\"chorale-like\\" and commented that \\"some biographers have felt that this music represented Chopin's faith in the consoling power of religion.\\"  No. 2, in G major  The Nocturne in G major is initially marked as andantino and is in 6/8 meter, remaining so for all 139 measures. It is written in the style of a Venetian barcarolle, which, according to Dubal, is engendered by the main theme's \\"euphonious thirds and sixths\\". Huneker commented that \\"pianists usually take the first part too fast, the second too slowly\\" and play the piece like an étude.Huneker (1966), pp. 261–262 Friskin commented that the sixths \\"require care to get evenness of tone control.\\" The piece has the structure A–B–A–B–A, somewhat unusual for a Chopin nocturne. The melody in thirds and sixths is similarly unusual, all other Chopin nocturnes opening with single-voice melodies. Secondary theme of Opus 37 No. 2 The nocturne has been acclaimed as one of the most beautiful melodies that Chopin has ever composed. Both Karasowski and Huneker agreed with this assessment; Karasowski claimed that \\"one can never listen [to the nocturne] without a sense of the deepest emotion and happiness,\\" and Huneker commented that the nocturne was \\"painted with Chopin's most ethereal brush\\". Frederick Niecks also thought the piece had \\"a beautiful sensuousness; it is luscious, soft, rounded, and not without a certain degree of languor.\\" To Blair Johnson, the theme is \\"certainly a musical embodiment of the 'less is more' doctrine.\\" Johnson also commented that \\"something of the warmer Mediterranean climate crept into the composer's pen,\\" in reference to Chopin's stay on the island of Majorca. Niecks also said that the nocturne \\"bewitches and unmans,\\" pointing to the formerly popular view that Chopin's music could act as an aphrodisiac. Similarly, Louis Kentner once said, in reference to this nocturne, that the nocturnes should not \\"suffer critical degradation because sentimental young ladies used them, in days long gone by, to comfort their repressed libido.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Analysis of Op. 37, No. 1 by Barbara Swanson McMaster Music Analysis Colloquium, Volume 1, December 1999 – Analysis of No. 1. *37 Category:1840 compositions Category:Compositions in G minor Category:Compositions in G major ja:夜想曲第11番 (ショパン) ","title":"Nocturnes, Op. 37 (Chopin)"},{"id":"21775255","text":"The Federal Desktop Core Configuration is a list of security settings recommended by the National Institute of Standards and Technology for general- purpose microcomputers that are connected directly to the network of a United States government agency. The FDCC is a list of agreed upon Microsoft Windows operating system common core system functions, applications, files, and services that are changed in their configuration around which a framework for a more secure, and security-reliable MS Windows operating system was created. The standards were then made mandatory for every federal government computer effective Feb 1, 2008. If you wanted to connect to a federal office computer network your system had to meet or exceed the FDCC standard or you were denied access. FDCC applied only to Windows XP and Vista desktop and laptop computers and was replaced by the United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB), which included settings for Windows 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. For Windows 7, the NIST changed the naming convention to the US Government Computer Baseline (USGCB ver 2.0). In addition to un-classifying a general Windows settings guide, the NIST also publishes guides specifically for Windows Firewall, Internet Explorer, and a guide (Vista-Energy, for example) created to capture settings that adhere to energy conservation policies. History On 20 March 2007 the Office of Management and Budget issued a memorandum instructing United States government agencies to develop plans for using the Microsoft Windows XP and Vista security configurations. The United States Air Force common security configurations for Windows XP were proposed as an early model on which standards could be developed. The FDCC baseline was developed (and is maintained) by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in collaboration with OMB, DHS, DOI, DISA, NSA, USAF and Microsoft, with input from public comment. It applies to Windows XP Professional and Vista systems only--these security policies are not tested (and according to the NIST, will not work) on Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000 or Windows Server 2003. Major Version 1.1 (released 31 October 2008) had no new or changed settings, but expanded SCAP reporting options. As with all previous versions, the standard is applicable to general-purpose workstations and laptops for end users. Windows XP and Vista systems in use as servers are exempt from this standard. Also exempt are embedded computers and \\"special purpose\\" systems (defined as specialized scientific, medical, process control, and experimental systems), though still recommends that FDCC security configuration be considered \\"where feasible and appropriate\\". The FDCC settings, generally speaking, block open connections in operating systems, disables functions, disables rarely used applications in the SOHO environment, disables unnecessary services, changes permissions on items, changes the way log files are collected and recorded, affects Group Policy Object (GPO) settings, and alters entries in the Windows system registry. InfoWeek introduced the FDCC to mostly administrators and engineers with the article titled ‘The Feds Don’t Allow It. Should You?’ written by Kelly Jackson Higgins of DarkReading.com and published on February 4, 2008. Due to the complexity of the guidelines response initially was slow. Implementation took time while the settings were internally researched by both government and enterprise implementation techs. The NIST and the NSA published guidelines in hundreds-of-page texts and introduced what they called SCAP files for applications. (See wikipedia SCAP page) The Windows platform was built for easy interoperability and networking and therefore left opportunities within the operating systems for all types of auto- and semi-automatic connections to other computers. These weren’t flaws or programming mistakes, it was purposefully built that way. An example of this can be found by looking at the Windows Remote Connection program which is enabled by default after a typical Windows operating system installation. The FDCC/USGCB configuration, for instance, reverses that setting so that you have to manually re-enable to allow remote connections. Requirements Organizations required to document FDCC compliance can do so by using SCAP tools. There are 600+ settings in the average FDCC/USGCB document – but not all of them are usable for the average small or home office (SOHO) computer. For instance, released on 20 June 2008, FDCC Major Version 1.0 specifies 674 settings. For example, \\"all wireless interfaces should be disabled\\". In recognition that not all recommended settings will be practical for every system, exceptions (such as \\"authorized enterprise wireless networks\\") can be made if documented in an FDCC deviation report. Strict implementation of all of the recommended settings has been known to cause usability issues. The NIST publishes a list of known issues and it can be found here (https://usgcb.nist.gov/usgcb/microsoft_content.html). There are a few third- party software vendors that have emerged that claim to have tested settings in a SOHO environment however, at this time, the general public still remains relatively unaware of the FDCC and USGCB security settings developed and put forward by the NIST.

Among other things it can be used to show that the Π02-theorems of various first-order theories of classical mathematics are also theorems of intuitionistic mathematics.

During her long tenure of twenty-six years of spiritual ministration, she initiated thousands of people, guiding them to lead a spiritual life. Before she became President of the Sri Sarada Math, she was headmistress of Sister Nivedita’s Girls’ School from 1946 to 1948. She had an ardent interest in providing education for women as envisaged by Swami Vivekananda. Bold and fearless, she encouraged other women to be fearless and self-confident. Swami Premeshananda, the then monastic head of Ramakrishna Mission Sevashrama at Sargachi met her at Nivedita School and later wrote to her, 'The very sight of you has raised such high hopes in me that I rejoice at the prospect that through you we may at last give effect to our long long cherished vow of bringing about women's emancipation.' After Sri Sarada Math and the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission were established, Pravrajika Mokshaprana became the Vice President and the Secretary and Headmistress of Shiksha Mandir, a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission at Baruipara in Kolkata. She thought of the students as her chosen ideal and was able to identify with them. The children responded to her faith in them. Under Pravrajika Mokshaprana the expansion of Sri Sarada Math and the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission which had started in the time of Pravrajika Bharatiprana continued to spread. New centres came up in Arunachal Pradesh, Pune, Bangalore, Trivandrum, Indore, Bhuvaneswar, Haridwar, Almora and one in far off Australia. New Mission centres were opened in the rural areas of West Bengal like Burdwan, Midnapore and 24 Parganas and Siriti in Kolkata. As President, she visited all the branch centers in India giving initiation to many and spreading the message of Sri Ramakrishna, Sri Sarada Devi and Swami Vivekananda. Whenever she visited a centre she created an atmosphere of a joyful festival to which the devotees looked forward each year. Pravrajika Mokshaprana’s life was distinguished by her learning and discipline. Her articles and lectures were published in the journals of the Order. A voracious reader, she studied the scriptures as well as other books about the world History and its trends. She was interested in a variety of subjects such as literature, astronomy, geography and philosophy. She enjoyed discussions with the scholars and distinguished litterateurs who visited her regularly. Her compassionate heart attracted many souls from far and near. Whether tribal children of Northeast India, scholars from America or probationers of the Math, everyone received her motherly love and inspiration. Early life Renuka Basu as she was known in her earlier days was born on 9 December 1915 to Brajendra Nath Basu and Pankajkumari Devi - a middle-class family of North Calcutta. Brajendranath was an employee of Calcutta Corporation and wanted to give his children including Renuka a decent education. In childhood she visited Dakshineswar temple and Kankurgachi Yogodyan, both places bearing the memories of the life and work of Sri Ramakrishna. After her father died Renu moved to her maternal uncles' house in Rajabazar with her family. Her uncle Dr. Satyesh Chandra Mitra first introduced Renu to Ramakrishna Mission and Belur Math. She came in intimate contact with Mahapurush Maharaj or Swami Shivananda, a direct disciple of Sri Ramakrishna. She was initiated into spiritual life by Swami Vijnanananda, a direct disciple of Sri Ramakrishna in 1935. In 1942 she passed Master of Arts in ancient Indian history and decided to lead a life of celibacy. In 1946 she joined Nivedita School as the headmistress at the behest of Swami Nirvedananda, who was a leading monk of the Ramakrishna Order and the head of Ramakrishna Mission Students Home, Belgharia. She was later given the post of secretary of the same school in 1949. =Travel= She traveled to Benaras, to Kankhal and to South India and Ceylone during this period. She also traveled to Kashmir. She met many veteran Sannyasins of Ramakrishna Order including Swami Atulananda or Gurudas Maharaj in Ramakrishna Mission Sevashrama, Kankhal who was a direct disciple of Swami Turiyananda, Swami Jagadananda, Swami Vishuddhananda, Swami Virajananda, Swami Shankarananda, Swami Shantananda and others. As Brahmacharini in Sri Sarada Math In 1953, on the occasion of the birth centenary of Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi, a group of seven dedicated workers of Nivedita School and other affiliated organizations like Matribhavan were given the vow of celibacy or Brahmacharya and Renu was one of them. During this period Renu had several letters from many renowned monks of Ramakrishna Order including Swami Premeshananda, the head of Ramakrishna Mission Sevashrama, Sargachi. She relinquished her posts in Nivedita school and joined Sarala, later known as Pravrajika Bharatiprana, the first president of Sri Sarada Math, as a spiritual inmate of the newly established Math. The new monastery was formed in Dakshineswar and Renuka was one of the dedicated workers. In 1959 she received the vow of Sannyas from Swami Shankarananda, the then president of Belur Math, and became known as Pravrajika Mokshaprana. As Sannyasin in Sri Sarada Math Mokshaprana Mataji was elected as a trustee of Sri Sarada Math in 1959 and in 1960 she became the vice president of the Math and the Mission. She personally supervised the construction of a degree college, Vivekananda college in Dumdum, under Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. She had knowledge of Homeopathy and she established a charitable dispensary in Dakshineswar which was frequented by the local people and this helped Sri Sarada Math to garner local support for its activities. In 1962 Ramakrishna Siksha Mandir, the second branch of Ramakrishna Sarada Mission was established in Baruipara Lane near Alambazar. It constituted a day care, a junior basic school and a mother teachers' training centre. Mokshaprana Mataji was the head of this centre and she built it and made it environment friendly as well as fit for children. She herself went to the localities to get students for the school. She took classes for the mothers of the children and also local women. She established Saradamani Pathshala for taking care of educational needs of underprivileged kids with the help of the mother teachers. She also began teaching extra curricular activities like music, drawing, painting, dancing, sewing etc. to make the mother teachers financially independent and sold the wares produced by them to make them and the ashram self-sufficient. President, Sri Sarada Math In 1973 she became the second president of Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission after passing away of Pravrajika Bharatiprana. She had laid great emphasis on discipline with love. She also ensured the spiritual growth and development of the new Brahmacharins and Sannyasins in the monastery. Her quotations - We have come here for the work of the Holy Trio, believe this with all your might. One should forego any ego as that is dangerous for an aspirant. Do not try to judge anybody, whatever is happening, become a silent witness. If you do not like anybody, do not hate or demean him or her. Your God has brought him or her here, do not forget that.\\" As the monastery head she looked after every affair of the Math and ensured that the core ideology was preserved.

Units The 163d Attack Wing consists of the following units: · 163d Operations Group · 196th Attack Squadron · 160th Attack Squadron (FTU) · 210th Weather Flight · 163d Mission Support Group · 163d Maintenance Group · 163d Medical Group History California Air National Guard 196th Fighter Interceptor Squadron F-102A Delta Dagger in 1970This aircraft is now on static display at Clovis Park, California. =Air Defense Command= On 17 May 1958, the California Air National Guard 196th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (FIS), at Ontario International Airport, was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 163d Fighter-Interceptor Group was established. The 196th FIS became the group's flying squadron. Other units assigned into the group were the 163d Material Squadron, 163d Air Base Squadron, and the 163d USAF Dispensary. The group's mobilization gaining command was Air Defense Command (ADC) Initially flying North American F-86A Sabre day interceptors, the squadron upgraded to F-86Hs in 1959 and to Convair F-102 Delta Daggers in 1965. The F-102 was being phased out of active-duty units in the early 1960s and the 163d was one of the last units to replace its F-86 Sabres. The F-102, however, was obsolescent as an interceptor by the time it was received by the 163d. The Delta Daggers soldiered into the early 1970s until they were retired to the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. Serving with distinction, the unit received two Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards for extended periods ending in 1964 and 1974. =Tactical Air Command= On 8 March 1975, the unit took on the challenge of a new mission and its mobilization gaining command became Tactical Air Command as the group became the 163d Tactical Air Support Group. The 163d received the 0-2A/B \\"Super Skymaster\\" to accomplish the unit's new role. 196th TFS F-4C about 1987Serial 63-7644. This was the type of aircraft Capt. Dean Paul Martin, was flying when he crashed. In October 1982, the 163d assumed a tactical fighter role flying the McDonnell Douglas F-4C Phantom II. The group concurrently moved to March Air Force Base, near Riverside, into new facilities specifically built for the unit. On 21 March 1987, Captain Dean Paul Martin (\\"Dino\\", son of entertainer Dean Martin), a pilot in the 196th Tactical Fighter Squadron crashed his F-4C into San Gorgonio Mountain, California shortly after departure from March AFB during a snow storm. Both Martin and his Weapons System Officer (WSO), Capt Ramon Ortiz were killed.\\"The Son Of Singer Dean Martin Killed While Flying His Military Phantom Jet.\\" avstop.com. Retrieved: 9 April 2011. The 163d transitioned to the upgraded F-4E Phantom II on 1 April 1987. This newer aircraft incorporated more sophisticated electronics and weaponry. In July 1990, the unit once again changed missions and was redesignated the 163d Tactical Reconnaissance Group. The 163d was equipped with RF-4C unarmed reconnaissance model of the Phantom II aircraft and maintained a dual state/federal mission. The unit's primary mission was to provide tactical reconnaissance to all friendly forces. The unit was also actively involved in statewide missions. This was accomplished by using a system of visual, optical, electronic, and other sensors. During this time the aircrews accumulated over 30,000 hours of flying time and the unit deployed across both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The 163d deployed to Pisa Airport, Italy, in support of Operation Decisive Endeavor. While deployed, the unit flew as the lead unit in support of flight operations over Bosnia. =Air Refueling= 196th Air Refueling Squadron KC-135 After the end of Operation Desert Storm in 1991, the phaseout of the RF-4C Phantom II with the Air National Guard was accelerated. In 1993, the RF-4s were retired to Davis-Monthan. The squadron became an air refueling group and was equipped with Boeing KC-135E Stratotankers. As a result of this change in mission and aircraft, the 163d's mobilization gaining command became Air Mobility Command. In 1995, the group expanded and became the 163d Air Refueling Wing. The wing later transitioned to the KC-135R Stratotanker. In one of the highest profile military events of the year, nearly 100 members and three KC-135R aircraft from the 163d wing deployed in support of Operation Allied Force. The 163d flew combat missions around-the-clock refueling North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) aircraft, including complex night formation sorties with the F-117A Nighthawk Stealth Fighter. 1999 also saw the 163d's Pacer Crag conversion begin in June and complete by the end of the year. This extensive aircraft modernization project meant intensive aircrew training and was expected to extend the life of the 40-year-old Boeing jet beyond the year 2020. The wing and its 196th Aerial Refueling Squadron were widely recognized for achievements in 1999 and earned the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for the fourth time. The award covers a period during which the unit deployed 300 personnel and three aircraft to Pisa Airport, Italy in support of Operation Decisive Endeavor and also flew as the lead unit in support of flight operations over Bosnia. The 163d Operations Support Flight, 163d Logistics Group, 163d Logistics Squadron, and the 196th Air Refueling Squadron also earned the Governor's Outstanding Unit Citation. The 163d provided support to NATO's Operation Joint Forge while deployed to Istres Air Base, France from 31 October through 3 December 2000, deploying three KC-135 Stratotanker air refueling aircraft along with nearly 210 personnel. As part of Air Expeditionary Force 9, the 163d \\"Grizzlies\\" also sent personnel to Kuwait, Germany, France, Saudi Arabia and Turkey from October through December 2000. =Unmanned Aerial Vehicle operations= During a ceremony 28 November 2007 at March Air Reserve Base, the 163d Air Refueling Wing became the 163d Reconnaissance Wing, taking on the Predator mission in place of its KC-135R tankers. The wing's last KC-135R left in April 2008. The wing was the first Air National Guard unit to receive the MQ-1 Predator armed unmanned reconnaissance aircraft and was the first to become a fully functional ANG Flying Training Unit (FTU) and to operate a Field Training Detachment (FTD) for the Predator. The wing operates its MQ-1s out of March ARB, but also uses the restricted airspace near Edwards Air Force Base, also in southern California, for training. The 163d also flies its Predators under the service's \\"remote split operations\\" approach. This means that the aircraft and a contingent of maintainers are deployed forward, along with some pilots to handle takeoffs and landings. However, the majority of the wing's pilots remain stateside and operate the aircraft via satellite communications links. The wing's FTU falls under Air Combat Command and trains pilots and sensor operators to become Predator aircrew. The FTD, which falls under Air Education and Training Command, trains enlisted personnel to build, maintain and repair the Predator. On 28 August 2013, a Predator flew over the Rim Fire in California providing infrared video of lurking fires, after receiving emergency approval.Elan Head. \\"Unmanned future \\" Vertical Magazine, 7 November 2013.

The process is the basis of organosilicon chemistry. Of organic compounds Alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines, thiols, and phosphates can be silylated. The process involves the replacement of a proton with a trialkylsilyl group, typically trimethylsilyl (-SiMe3). Generally the substrate is deprotonated with a suitable strong base followed by treatment with a silyl chloride (e.g. trimethylsilyl chloride). Often strong bases such butyl lithium or a Grignard reagent are used, as illustrated by the synthesis of a trimethylsilyl ethers as protecting groups from an alcohol: :ROH + BuLi → ROLi + BuH :ROLi + Me3SiCl → ROSiMe3 \\\\+ LiCl Bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (\\"BSA\\", Me3SiNC(OSiMe3)Me is an efficient silylation agent used for the derivatisation of compounds.

The introduction of a silyl group(s) gives derivatives of enhanced volatility, making the derivatives suitable for analysis by gas chromatography and electron-impact mass spectrometry (EI-MS). For EI-MS, the silyl derivatives give more favorable diagnostic fragmentation patterns of use in structure investigations, or characteristic ions of use in trace analyses employing selected ion monitoring and related techniques.http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/analytical-chromatography/analytical- reagents/derivatization-reagents/silylation.html =Desilylation= Desilylation is the reverse of silylation: the silyl group is exchanged for a proton.

It is native to the Caribbean and certain parts of South America. It is widely naturalized in many other parts of the world, where it can be found in varied habitat types and in many areas grows as a roadside weed. Description Euphorbia prostrata is an annual herb producing slender prostrate stems up to approximately long, sometimes purple-tinted in color.Aluka Profile The oval-shaped leaves are up to long with finely toothed edges. The inflorescence is a cyathium less than wide, with white petal-like appendages surrounding the actual flowers. There are four male flowers and a single female flower, the latter developing into a lobed, hairy fruit wide. E. prostrata is similar to both Euphorbia maculata and Euphorbia serpens, but is often hairy on the leaves and stems, while the latter two species are often smooth. It differs from E. maculata by its less elongated and less lanceolate leaves. E. serpens by contrast has much more rounded leaves than E. prostrata with relatively larger and more conspicuous flowers. The flowers of E. prostrata do not typically show the white \\"petals\\" seen in E. serpens or E. maculata and thus flowers are hard to detect in the former species. Only E. maculata shows dark spots in the center of each leaf, but this is not always present in that species. Medicinal use Euphorbia prostrata extract has been found effective for treatment of bleeding hemorrhoids due to its contents of flavonoids, phenolics and phenolic acids. Euphorbia prostrata extract tablets have been marketed in India by Panacea Biotec Ltd.

History of the Castle of Collioure  The Château is the juxtaposition of at least four castles. Roussillon was conquered by the Romans around 120 BC and then occupied by the Visigoths from 418. The first mention is about a fortified site in Collioure under siege in 673, by Wamba, king of the Visigoths who lay siege to the \\"Castellum Caucolibéri\\" to subdue a rebellion. =Castle of the Templars= In the 12th century, Girard II, the last independent count of the Roussillon, bequeathed his land to Alfons II, King of Aragon and Count of Barcelona. Concerned about the prosperity of Collioure, the kings of Aragon granted privileges and tax exemptions. An annual fair was established, and important works were undertaken in the castle, the port and the town. The Knights Templar built the castle around 1207 and integrated it to the royal castle in 1345. =Kings of Majorca= A second castle was later built by the Kings of Majorca during the 13th and 14th centuries. In the 13th century, the Castle was annexed to the Kingdom of Majorca, which included the domain of Montpellier, the earldoms of the Roussillon and Cerdanya, the Conflent and Vallespir, and the Balearic Islands. The Kings of Majorca were itinerant. They travelled with their court, moving frequently from Maguelonne, near Montpellier, to Perpignan, to Palma de Majorca or to Collioure. =Habsburg fortress: Charles Quint and Philip II= In the 16th century, after a brief occupation by Louis XI, the Spanish Habsburgs, starting with Charles Quint, again occupied Collioure. He and his son Philip II turned the castle into a modern fortress of the 16th century. It was imperative that the fortifications were adapted in line with the advances in artillery, and so the castle defences and its surroundings were considerably reinforced. =Bourbon citadel= In the 17th century Collioure was at stake in the wars between the Spanish Habsburgs and the French Bourbons. In 1642, Louis XIII's troops lay siege to Collioure and the Château Royal. Ten thousand men including Turenne, d'Artagnan and the King's musketeers occupied the hills overlooking the town, while the French fleet blocked the port. Deprived of water due to the destruction of their wells, the Spanish were forced to surrender. In 1659, France annexed the Roussillon and Collioure and the castle passed definitively into French hands. Vauban built the bastions, reinforced the structure and upgraded Fort Saint-Elme. =The Roussillon war= General Dugommier In 1793, the Spanish again besieged and occupied Collioure, which General Dugommier took back the next year. He captured Fort Saint-Elme on 25 May and forced the Spanish general Eugenio Navarro to surrender the next day. =The 20th century= * Fort Saint-Elme was sold at auction in August 1913. * The castle was designated an historic monument in 1922. The castle was turned into a men's prison in March 1939 and became the first disciplinary camp for the Spanish refugees of the Retirada, the exile from the Spanish Civil War. Many others were sent to the camps of Argelès-sur-Mer and Rivesaltes. After 1941, French detainees were prisoners of the Vichy regime. The prison received men sentenced for indiscipline, attempted escape and incitement to rebellion from the camps of Argelès-sur-Mer, Saint-Cyprien and Le Barcarès. The detainees transited there before being sent to North Africa. Property of the General Council of the Pyrénées-Orientales since 1951, the castle is one of the major tourist spots in Northern Catalonia.

The film, shot in a jazzy, free-wheeling style and featuring Doyle's signature hyper-kinetic, oversaturated photography and eccentric humor, focuses on a trip that Asano's character takes to Hong Kong and his encounters with off-beat personalities populating the metropolitan landscape (among them, a beer-drinking amnesiac gay bar owner portrayed by Kevin Sherlock). Another narrative thread relies on flashbacks into Asano's character's childhood in Okinawa. The protagonist suffers from overbearing excesses of his memory, mnemonic associations and synesthesia. The emerging human attachments provide an emotional center and a source of serenity to offset the rampage of the protagonist's mind and tame the lavish disarray of urban imagery. The film credits Borges (presumably Funes the Memorious) and Luria for inspiration. Many aspects of Asano's character (memory excess, profound synesthesia, arranging memories visually along roads, wordplay, struggling with an onslaught of associations, comments about restaurant music and its effect on food taste, the waking-for-school scene) are directly borrowed from Luria's real life case study of Solomon Shereshevskii, The Mind of a Mnemonist. The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival.

The Atik Valide Mosque () is a 16th century Ottoman imperial mosque located on a hill above the large and densely populated district of Üsküdar, in Istanbul, Turkey. It was built for Nurbanu Sultan, the wife of Sultan Selim II and formed part of a large complex that included a madrasa, guest-rooms and a double caravanseray. The mosque was designed by the imperial architect Mimar Sinan. Planning began in 1571 for a small mosque with a single minaret. The mosque was subsequently expanded and was not completed until 1586, three years after Nurbanu's death. History The Atik Valide Mosque (name translation: Old Queen Mother Mosque) was one of the most extensive mosque complexes in Istanbul area. The mosque was built for Nurbanu Sultan, the Venetian-born wife of Selim II and the mother of Murad III. She was the first valide sultan (queen mother) that exercised effective rule over the Ottoman Empire from the harem during the period known as the Sultanate of Women. The mosque was designed by the imperial architect Mimar Sinan and built in three stages. From the ground breaking in 1571 until the completion of the initial version of the mosque in 1574 another imperial architect supervised the work as Sinan was based in Edirne during the construction of the Selimiye Mosque. The second stage lasted from 1577 until 1578 and involved the addition of a second single-galleried minaret and a double portico. These changes were probably made as a result of Nurbanu's enhanced status as following accession of her son Murad III in 1574 she became the queen mother. Nurbanu died in 1583 and the third and final stage of construction took place between 1584 and 1586 after her death. The mosque was expanded laterally with the addition of a pair of small domes on each side of the central dome. The mosque formed part of a large complex that also included a madrasa, a hadith college, a school for Quran recitation, an elementary school, a dervish convent, a hospital and a hospice complex that contained a guest-house and a double caravansaray. A bath-house was also built at this time. Architecture The main space is covered by a central dome of diameter supported on six arches arranged in a hexagon with two free-standing columns. The space is expanded by five exedral semi-domes, one of which contains the mihrab. The arch on the north side is filled with a flat wall which contains the entrance portal. The interior is surrounded on three sides by galleries. The qibla wall and the mihrab recess are decorated with Iznik tiles. A pair of matched arched tiled panels on the side walls on either side of the mihrab depict spring blossoms and flowers. Above the windows under the portico on the north facade are ten rectangular calligraphic lunette panels. Four panels, two panels at each end, were added when the mosque was extended. They quote text from the Quran surah (48:3–4). The six central panel quote text from surah (39:53). Upper floors were added to the hospice buildings in the 19th century when they were converted into a military hospital and prison.

The ruins of the former Augustinian abbey mostly date to the 13th century and have been described as featuring some of finest examples of medieval ecclesiastical architecture in Ireland. History In the early 7th century, a church was built at this site, reportedly by Saint Feichin. A later building was destroyed by fire in 1114. Within the next twenty years or so, Turlough Mor O’Connor, the High King of Ireland, refounded the abbey. Raiders from Munster destroyed the buildings in 1137 but they were rebuilt by King Turlough. The Abbey was refounded as an Augustinian settlement in 1138. It was one of the earliest Augustinian settlements south of Armagh which was founded in 1126. In 1198, his son, Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair (Rory O'Connor), Ireland's last High King, constructed new buildings and also lived the last 15 years of his life at the abbey.Sir W. Wilde Lough Corrib, p. 181. He died here and was reportedly briefly buried in the abbey before being exhumed and re-interred at Clonmacnoise. Cong Abbey was also closely associated with the O'Duffy family at least from 1097 to 1501. The Annals of the Four Masters record that in 1150, Muireadhach Ua Dubhthaigh, Archbishop of Connacht, died at Cong aged 75. His name is inscribed upon the processional Cross of Cong.Stokes, Margaret. Early Christian Art in Ireland. Part 1. London: Chapman and Hall Limited, 1887–1894 The Norman knight, William de Burgh, attacked Cong in 1203, and again the abbey was rebuilt. In the 1307 the abbey was reconstructed and dedicated to St Mary. Cong Abbey was suppressed sometime after 1542 and later fell into ruins. The last (nominal) abbot was Father Patrick Prendergast, parish priest of Cong from 1795 until his death in 1829. He was the preserver of the Cross of Cong. After his death, the cross was bought by James MacCullagh for the Royal Irish Academy. The first restoration of the abbey was started by Benjamin Guinness in 1855, soon after he had bought nearby Ashford Castle in 1852. Architecture The remains of Cong Abbey have been praised as featuring some of the finest examples of early gothic architecture and masonry in Ireland. The present church, and possibly the fragmentary cloister where the monks worked and prayed, belong to the rebuilding of the early 13th century. The north doorway of the church, and the elaborate doorways that open onto the cloister from the east range of the monastery, may pre-date the attack by William de Burgo. The doorway with two fine windows on either side belongs to the chapter house, where the monastery's daily business was conducted as well as a chapter of the rule being read each day. This was also where the community gathered to confess their sins publicly. The sculpture in the abbey, which is some of the finest in Ireland, suggests links to French styles of the period. The grounds of the abbey also contain a monks' fishing house, probably built in the 15th or 16th century, on an island in the River Cong leading towards nearby Lough Corrib. The house is built on a platform of stones over a small arch which allows the river to flow underneath the floor. There is a trapdoor in the floor in which the fish may have been kept fresh. According to local tradition, a line was connected from the fishing house to the monastery kitchen to alert the cook to fresh fish. Today Cong Abbey is a national monument in the care of the Commissioners for Public Works.

For a brief period of time it looked as if 'mental retardation' would come over from the United States as the new terminology to replace 'mental handicap' which was unpopular. However, that did not happen and the term 'learning disability' was adopted by the Department of Health (after much debate and some disagreement which continues to today because the term 'learning disability' has a different meaning in the education world). ARC quickly shortened its name to the Association for Residential Communities and then later to the Association for Residential Care. The most recent change reflects the major policy changes in social care in that ARC (which is how it is known) now stands for The Association for Real Change. ARC was incorporated as a registered charity in 1982.Charity Commission In 1992 the ARC Training Consortium was set up to support members who wanted to increase their own NVQ assessor/verifier capacity and to enable their staff to gain the appropriate NVQs and subsequently the ARC Training Centre. It is part of the coalition of charities and councils urging the British government to solve the social care crisis and was part of the campaign by the major care provider bodies around the Mental Capacity (Amendment) Bill.

Created in 1966, Merit operates the longest running regional computer network in the United States. Organization Original Merit logo, c. 1968 Created in 1966 as the Michigan Educational Research Information Triad by Michigan State University (MSU), the University of Michigan (U-M), and Wayne State University (WSU),\\"Merit–Who, What, and Why, Part One: The Early Years, 1964-1983\\", Eric M. Aupperle, Merit Network, Inc., in Library Hi Tech, vol. 16, No. 1 (1998) Merit was created to investigate resource sharing by connecting the mainframe computers at these three Michigan public research universities. Merit's initial three node packet-switched computer network was operational in October 1972 using custom hardware based on DEC PDP-11 minicomputers and software developed by the Merit staff and the staffs at the three universities. Over the next dozen years the initial network grew as new services such as dial-in terminal support, remote job submission, remote printing, and file transfer were added; as gateways to the national and international Tymnet, Telenet, and Datapac networks were established, as support for the X.25 and TCP/IP protocols was added; as additional computers such as WSU's MVS system and the UM's electrical engineering's VAX running UNIX were attached; and as new universities became Merit members. Merit's involvement in national networking activities started in the mid-1980s with connections to the national supercomputing centers and work on the 56 kbit/s National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET), the forerunner of today's Internet. From 1987 until April 1995, Merit re-engineered and managed the NSFNET backbone service.NSFNET: A Partnership for High-Speed Networking, Final Report, 1987-1995, Karen D. Frazer, Merit Network, Inc. MichNet, Merit's regional network in Michigan was attached to NSFNET and in the early 1990s Merit began extending \\"the Internet\\" throughout Michigan, offering both direct connect and dial-in services, and upgrading the statewide network from 56 kbit/s to 1.5 Mbit/s, and on to 45, 155, 622 Mbit/s, and eventually 1 and 10 Gbit/s. In 2003 Merit began its transition to a facilities based network, using fiber optic facilities that it shares with its members, that it purchases or leases under long-term agreements, or that it builds. In addition to network connectivity services, Merit offers a number of related services within Michigan and beyond, including: Internet2 connectivity, VPN, Network monitoring, Voice over IP (VOIP), Cloud storage, E-mail, Domain Name, Network Time, VMware and Zimbra software licensing, Colocation, Michigan Cyber Range cybersecurity courses, and professional development seminars, workshops, classes, conferences, and meetings.  History Creating the network: 1966 to 1973= The Michigan Educational Research Information Triad (MERIT) was formed in the fall of 1966 by Michigan State University (MSU), University of Michigan (U-M), and Wayne State University (WSU). More often known as the Merit Computer Network or simply Merit, it was created to design and implement a computer network connecting the mainframe computers at the universities. In the fall of 1969, after funding for the initial development of the network had been secured, Bertram Herzog was named director for MERIT.A Chronicle of Merit's Early History , John Mulcahy, Merit Network, Inc., 1989\\"Bert Herzog, 1929-2008: Remembrances and Recollections\\", IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, vol.28, no.5, pp. 6-9 (Sep./Oct. 2008), Eric Aupperle was hired as senior engineer, and was charged with finding hardware to make the network operational.\\"40 years and going strong: Internet pioneer [Eric Aupperle of] Merit celebrates and looks ahead\\" , Jim Duffy, Network World, November 10, 2006 The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the State of Michigan provided the initial funding for the network. Merit PDP-11 based Primary Communications Processor (PCP) at the University of Michigan, c. 1975 In June 1970, the Applied Dynamics Division of Reliance Electric in Saline, Michigan was contracted to build three Communication Computers or CCs. Each would consist of a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-11 computer, dataphone interfaces, and interfaces that would attach them directly to the mainframe computers. The cost was to be slightly less than the $300,000 ($, adjusted for inflation) originally budgeted. Merit staff wrote the software that ran on the CCs, while staff at each of the universities wrote the mainframe software to interface to the CCs. The first completed connection linked the IBM S/360-67 mainframe computers running the Michigan Terminal System at WSU and U-M, and was publicly demonstrated on December 14, 1971.UM and Wayne State connect their computing centers via MERIT, University of Michigan Board of Regents, Regents' Proceedings, March 1972, p. 1416 The MSU node was completed in October 1972, adding a CDC 6500 mainframe running Scope/Hustler.\\"CDC 6000 Operating System (SCOPE/Hustler)\\", web page by Mark Riordan at Michigan State University The network was officially dedicated on May 15, 1973. =Expanding the network: 1974 to 1985= In 1974, Herzog\\"SIGGRAPH Community mourns the death of Bertram Herzog, an early advocate of computer networking\\" , July 18, 2008, ACM SIGGRAPH web page returned to teaching in the University of Michigan's Industrial Engineering Department, and Aupperle was appointed as director. Use of the all uppercase name \\"MERIT\\" was abandoned in favor of the mixed case \\"Merit\\". The first network connections were host to host interactive connections which allowed person to remote computer or local computer to remote computer interactions. To this, terminal to host connections, batch connections (remote job submission, remote printing, batch file transfer), and interactive file copy were added.\\"Merit's Evolution—Statistically Speaking\\", Eric M. Aupperle, IEEE Transactions on Computers, Vol.32 No.10 (October 1983), pp. 881-902 And, in addition to connecting to host computers over custom hardware interfaces, the ability to connect to hosts or other networks over groups of asynchronous ports and via X.25 were added. Merit interconnected with Telenet (later SprintNet) in 1976 to give Merit users dial-in access from locations around the United States. Dial-in access within the U.S. and internationally was further expanded via Merit's interconnections to Tymnet, ADP's Autonet, and later still the IBM Global Network as well as Merit's own expanding network of dial-in sites in Michigan, New York City, and Washington, D.C. In 1978, Western Michigan University (WMU) became the fourth member of Merit (prompting a name change, as the acronym Merit no longer made sense as the group was no longer a triad). To expand the network, the Merit staff developed new hardware interfaces for the Digital PDP-11 based on printed circuit technology. The new system became known as the Primary Communications Processor (PCP), with the earliest PCPs connecting a PDP-10 located at WMU and a DEC VAX running UNIX at U-M's Electrical Engineering department. A second hardware technology initiative in 1983 produced the smaller Secondary Communication Processors (SCP) based on DEC LSI-11 processors. The first SCP was installed at the Michigan Union in Ann Arbor, creating UMnet, which extended Merit's network connectivity deeply into the U-M campus. In 1983 Merit's PCP and SCP software was enhanced to support TCP/IPMerit had the distinction of being the first network to concurrently support both connection-based protocols (its own internal protocol and X.25) and the connectionless TCP/IP protocols. and Merit interconnected with the ARPANET. =National networking, NSFNET, and the Internet: 1986 to 1995= In 1986 Merit engineered and operated leased lines and satellite links that allowed the University of Michigan to access the supercomputing facilities at Pittsburgh, San Diego, and NCAR. NSFNET logo T3 NSFNET Backbone, c. 1992 In 1987, Merit, IBM and MCI submitted a winning proposal to NSF to implement a new NSFNET backbone network. The new NSFNET backbone network service began July 1, 1988. It interconnected supercomputing centers around the country at 1.5 megabits per second (T1), 24 times faster than the 56 kilobits-per-second speed of the previous network. The NSFNET backbone grew to link scientists and educators on university campuses nationwide and connect them to their counterparts around the world.From the NSFNET mid-project review conducted by NSF in May 1989: \\"One of the most important successes of the NSFNET backbone project has been the demonstration that universities and major high-tech corporations can combine and collaborate in running a large production facility and do it well. It is worth emphasizing this, since the popular wisdom holds that: (a) universities cannot run a production operation, and (b) that university-industry collaborations are only useful for advanced research projects. What the MERIT-IBM-MCI team has demonstrated is that a collaboration between academia and industry is very useful in setting up a production system involving innovative management and new technologies.\\" The NSFNET project caused substantial growth at Merit, nearly tripling the staff and leading to the establishment of a new 24-hour Network Operations Center at the U-M Computer Center. In September 1990 in anticipation of the NSFNET T3 upgrade and the approaching end of the 5-year NSFNET cooperative agreement, Merit, IBM, and MCI formed Advanced Network and Services (ANS), a new non-profit corporation with a more broadly based Board of Directors than the Michigan-based Merit Network.\\"The Technology Timetable\\", Link Letter, November 1992, p. 8, NSFNET Information Services, Merit Network, Inc., Ann Arbor Under its cooperative agreement with NSF, Merit remained ultimately responsible for the operation of NSFNET, but subcontracted much of the engineering and operations work to ANS. In 1991 the NSFNET backbone service was expanded to additional sites and upgraded to a more robust 45 Mbit/s (T3) based network. The new T3 backbone was named ANSNet and provided the physical infrastructure used by Merit to deliver the NSFNET Backbone Service. On April 30, 1995, the NSFNET project came to an end, when the NSFNET backbone service was decommissioned and replaced by a new Internet architecture with commercial ISPs interconnected at Network Access Points provided by multiple providers across the country. =Bringing the Internet to Michigan: 1985 to 2001= New Merit logo, c. 1990 During the 1980s, Merit Network grew to serve eight member universities, with Oakland University joining in 1985 and Central Michigan University, Eastern Michigan University, and Michigan Technological University joining in 1987.\\"Merit–Who, What, and Why, Part Two: The Middle Years, 1983-1993\\", Eric M. Aupperle, Merit Network, Inc., in Library Hi Tech, vol. 16, No. 1 (1998) MichNet logo, c. 1990 In 1990, Merit's board of directors formally changed the organization's name to Merit Network, Inc., and created the name MichNet to refer to Merit's statewide network. The board also approved a staff proposal to allow organizations other than publicly supported universities, referred to as affiliates, to be served by MichNet without prior board approval. 1992 saw major upgrades of the MichNet backbone to use Cisco routers in addition to the PDP-11 and LSI-11 based PCPs and SCPs. This was also the start of relentless upgrades to higher and higher speeds, first from 56 kbit/s to T1 (1.5 Mbit/s) followed by multiple T1s (3.0 to 10.5 Mbit/s), T3 (45 Mbit/s), OC3c (155 Mbit/s), OC12c (622 Mbit/s), and eventually one and ten gigabits (1000 to 10,000 Mbit/s). In 1993 Merit's first Network Access Server (NAS) using RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) was deployed.The Beginnings and History of RADIUS, John Vollbrecht, 2006, Interlink Networks, LLC, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA The NASs supported dial-in access separate from the Merit PCPs and SCPs. In 1993 Merit started what would become an eight-year phase out of its aging PCP and SCP technology. By 1998 the only PCPs still in service were supporting Wayne State University's MTS mainframe host. During their remarkably long twenty-year life cycle the number of PCPs and SCPs in service reached a high of roughly 290 in 1991, supporting a total of about 13,000 asynchronous ports and numerous LAN and WAN gateways. MichNet Shared Dial-in Map, c. 1996 In 1994 the Merit Board endorsed a plan to expand the MichNet shared dial-in service, leading to a rapid expansion of the Internet dial-in service over the next several years.\\"Merit–Who, What, and Why, Part Three: Recent Events, 1993-1998\\", Eric M. Aupperle, Merit Network, Inc., in Library Hi Tech, vol. 16, No. 1 (1998)\\"A Breed Apart: The Dial-In Men\\", David Greenfield, Network Magazine, December 1, 2000 In 1994 there were 38 shared dial-in sites. By 1996 there were 131 shared dial-in sites and more than 92% of Michigan residents could reach the Internet with a local phone call. And by the end of 2001 there were 10,733 MichNet shared dial-in lines in over 200 Michigan cities plus New York City, Washington, D.C., and Windsor, Ontario, Canada. As an outgrowth of this work, in 1997, Merit created the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) Consortium.Merit timeline During 1994 an expanded K-12 outreach program at Merit helped lead the formation of six regional K-12 groups known as Hubs. The Hubs and Merit applied for and were awarded funding from the Ratepayer fund, which as part of a settlement of an earlier Ameritech of Michigan ratepayer overcharge, had been established by Michigan Public Service Commission to further the K-12 community's network connectivity. During the 1990s, Merit added Grand Valley State University (1994), Northern Michigan University (1994), Lake Superior State University (1997), and Ferris State University (1998) as members. By 1999, Merit had 163 affiliate members, with 401 attachments from 353 separate locations. Merit was involved in a number of projects in cooperation with organizations throughout Michigan, including: *Project Connect, a 1992 cooperative effort among Merit, Novell, and GTE, that equipped five southeastern Michigan schools with Novell Local Area Networks with connections to MichNet; *GoMLink, an early virtual library reference service operated by the University of Michigan; *the Michigan Electronic Library (MEL), a networked virtual library service of the Library of Michigan and the University of Michigan; *the Michigan Library Association's \\"Action Plan for Michigan Libraries\\"; Internet dial-in access for libraries sponsored by the Library of Michigan; *development of the \\"Michigan Information Network (MIN) Plan\\"; *in cooperation with MiCTA,\\"About MiCTA\\" , web page providing assistance to the K-12, library, and rural healthcare communities in understanding the federal Universal Service Fund (USF) E-Rate program; and *the Society of Manufacturing Engineers CoNDUIT project, funded by the United States Department of Defense to train staff of small manufacturing businesses in the use of modern technology. =Transition to the commercial Internet, Internet2 and the vBNS: 1994 to 2005= In 1994, as the NSFNET project was drawing to a close, Merit organized the meetings for the North American Network Operators' Group (NANOG). NANOG evolved from the NSFNET \\"Regional- Techs\\" meetings, where technical staff from the regional networks met to discuss operational issues of common concern with each other and with the Merit engineering staff. At the February 1994 regional techs meeting in San Diego, the group revised its charterOriginal 1994 NANOG Charter to include a broader base of network service providers, and subsequently adopted NANOG as its new name. Also starting in 1994, Merit developed the Routing Assets Database (RADb) as part of the NSF-funded Routing Arbiter Project.NSF Solicitation 93-52 - Network Access Point Manager, Routing Arbiter, Regional Network Providers, and Very High Speed Backbone Network Services Provider for NSFNET and the NREN(SM) Program, May 6, 1993The Routing Arbiter Project, Project History, Merit Network, Inc.

In December 2006 Merit and OSTN partner to provide IPTV to Michigan institutions.\\"Merit Network and OSTN Unite to Provide IPTV to Michigan Institutions\\" , November 30, 2006, Press Release, Open Student Television Network OSTN is a global television network devoted to student-produced programming. In July 2007, Merit decommissioned its dial-up services. During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s Merit operated what is known as a \\"value-added network\\" where individual data circuits were leased on a relatively short-term basis (one to three or sometimes five years) from traditional telecommunications providers such as Ameritech, GTE, Sprint, and MCI and assembled into a larger network by adding routers and other equipment. This worked well for many years, but as data rates continued to increase from kilobits, to megabits, to gigabits the cost of leasing the higher speed data circuits became significant. As a result, the alternative of building its network using \\"dark fiber\\" that Merit owned or leased on a relatively longer-term basis (10, 20, or more years) under what are known as \\"Indefeasible Rights of Use\\" (IRU) as well as using or sharing fiber that is owned by its members became attractive. Merit's statewide fiber- optic network strategy began to take shape when: * in 2003 a fiber ring was deployed in Lansing; * in 2003 Michigan State University, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State University launched the Michigan LambdaRail Network (MiLR) project to link the campuses to each other and to Chicago using privately owned fiber, with Merit to operate MiLR on behalf of the three universities and using some of the MiLR fiber for its own network;Michigan LambdaRail (MiLR), web page, ITS Networking & Telecommunications, Information and Technology Services (ITS), University of Michigan * in 2004 fiber rings were added in Grand Rapids and Chicago; * in August 2005 Merit was utilizing dark fiber from Michigan Lambda Rail (MiLR) between Detroit and Chicago to support the southern portion of its network backbone; * in July 2006 Merit began to use optical fiber that had been installed by a consortium of government and community organizations in the Alpena area; * in February 2006 Merit and the Ontario Research and Innovation Optical Network (ORION) were linked using fiber optic cable across the US-Canada border through the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel, later in September 2008, a wireless connection across the Soo Locks between Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan and Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario provided a second link between Merit and ORION; * in September 2007 Merit created the first high-speed network connection between Michigan's two peninsulas with fiber optic cable across the Mackinac Bridge; * in November 2007 Merit completed Phase I of its fiber network expansion into the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, connecting Lake Superior State University (LSSU), Michigan Technological University (MTU), and Northern Michigan University (NMU) via fiber-optic cable at gigabit Ethernet speeds; * in May 2008 Merit completes a new fiber optic link from Southfield to Toledo providing a 10 Gbit/s link to OSCnet, Ohio's regional research and education network, and a second path between Merit and the Internet2 network; * in March 2009 a partnership between the City of Hillsdale, Hillsdale College, Hillsdale County Intermediate School District (ISD), and Merit, completed a fiber-optic ring to improve connectivity in the city and reduce network costs for the Hillsdale- area organizations; and * in December 2009 Merit began to use a new fiber optic link between Mt. Pleasant and Big Rapids. This completed the \\"Blue-Line\\" fiber optic network that links 16 cities in the lower half of Michigan's lower peninsula (Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids, Muskegon, Big Rapids, Mt. Pleasant, Midland, Saginaw, Flint, Pontiac, Rochester, Southfield, Ypsilanti, Ann Arbor, Jackson, East Lansing, and Battle Creek).\\"Merit Network Celebrates the Completion of its \\"Blue-Line\\" Fiber-Optic Network\\", January 12, 2010, Press Release, Merit Network, Inc.

Each location provides certification courses, cybersecurity training exercises and product hardening/testing through a direct connection to the Michigan Cyber Range. In 2016, Merit began one of its largest projects; managing the implementation of the Michigan Statewide Education Network (MISEN), a private transport based network. MISEN connects 55 of Michigan's 56 Intermediate School Districts (ISDs) via high capacity fiber infrastructure. The project was completed on June 30, 2017, and the end result was a 10 Gb connection to each ISD as well as a 100 Gb resilient core. Merit continues to manage MISEN, which gives Michigan ISDs the ability to leverage the multi-gigabit infrastructure for services like Internet access, student information systems, and other critical services, putting Michigan's schools at the forefront of technology and innovation. Throughout 2017, Merit has continued shifting their strategy to focus on network, security and community. They are now considered one of the national leaders in cybersecurity. In 2019, Merit launched the Michigan Moonshot, an approach to impact the digital divide statewide. In 2019, as part of the Michigan Moonshot, Merit partnered with national broadband organizations (including the Michigan Broadband Cooperative, Next Century Cities, and the Institute for Local Self Reliance) to create the Michigan Moonshot Broadband Framework. This crowdsourced document will serve as a community network primer and the basis for planning a community roadmap. Contained within, a reader will find overviews on policy and technology, community success stories, links to myriad resources and planning tools from national broadband leaders and a phased plan for building a regional network. While much of this information exists in locations across the web, this unique curation was carefully designed by leading experts to serve as a comprehensive playbook for communities that are committed to improving broadband access for their citizens. In May 2019, Merit Network, in partnership with Michigan State University's Quello Center and the D.C.-based Measurement Lab, launched a pilot for the Michigan Moonshot broadband data collection project. Three school districts, representing more than 6,000 students, were chosen. The data for this project consisted of three databases linked by a unique de-identified participant ID; including a paper survey completed by all students age 13 and older, student records (i.e., M-STEP scores) that were de-identified and results of an Internet speed test that students completed on a website using any device they used to complete homework. Armed with an accurate picture of Michigan's connectivity, barriers to broadband network deployment in rural communities could be reduced through a combination of techniques. Pilot project findings are expected to be released in late fall, 2019. On May 30, 2019, Merit hosted the Mackinac Policy Conference Session as part of the Michigan Moonshot initiative. President and CEO of Merit Network Joe Sawasky moderated a panel titled “Digital Inclusion: #FixTheDamnInternet for Michigan Students.” The panel featured state, regional, and national thought leaders, including: Dr. Johannes Bauer, Quello chair for media and information policy and chairman of the department of media and information at Michigan State University, Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist II, and Marc Hudson, founder and CEO of Rocket Fiber. In October 2019, Merit's president and CEO, Joe Sawasky, joined Former FCC Commissioner, Mignon Clyburn, Jonathan Sallet, senior fellow at the Benton Institute, Larra Clark, deputy director at the American Library Association Public Policy and Luis Wong, CEO of the California K-12 High Speed Network for a panel discussion, Broadband for All in the 2020s at the 2019 SHLB Coalition’s Anchor NETS conference. In 2019, Jonathan Sallet, Senior Fellow for the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, published Broadband for America’s Future: A Vision for the 2020s. The purpose of this document is to collect, combine, and contribute to a national broadband agenda for the next decade. As the most transformative technology of our generation, broadband delivers new opportunities and strengthens communities. The Benton Institute upholds a commitment to changing lives and advancing society through high-performance broadband connection, which will bring remarkable economic, social, cultural, and personal benefits. In 2019, Merit's Chief Information Security Officer role grew into an executive position, overseeing the Michigan Cyber Range and Merit's security division. Kevin Hayes has served as Merit's CISO since 2018. In 2019, Merit Network partnered with MISEN (Michigan Statewide Educational Network) and MAISA (Michigan Association of Intermediate School Administrators) to develop Essential Cybersecurity Practices for K12. This guide translates the CIS Top 20 Security Controls into achievable actions that school IT staff can accomplish.

Founded in 2004, the consortium is composed of service and resource providers, researchers from universities and national laboratories, as well as computing centers across the United States. Members independently own and manage the resources which make up the distributed facility, and consortium agreements provide the framework for technological and organizational integration. Use The OSG is used by scientists and researchers for data analysis tasks which are too computationally intensive for a single data center or supercomputer. While most of the grid's resources are used for particle physics, research teams from disciplines like biology, chemistry, astronomy, and geographic information systems are currently using the grid to analyze data. Research using the grid's resources has been published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry. and the Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling =Large Hadron Collider= The Open Science Grid was created in order to facilitate data analysis from the Large Hadron Collider, and about 70% of its 300,000 computing-hours per day are dedicated to the analysis of data from particle colliders. Once data has been collected and distributed by the LHC Computing Grid, the Open Science Grid assists physicists from institutions around the world in analysis. The grid has been designed so that resources and data are shared automatically: Architecture In total, the OSG comprises over 25,000 computers with over 43,000 processors, most of which are running a distribution of Linux. 72 institutions, including 42 universities, are consortium members who contribute resources to the grid. There are 90 distinct computational and storage nodes in the grid, which are distributed across the United States and Brazil. =Peerage= The grid is peered with other grids, including TeraGrid, LHC Computing Grid, the European Grid Infrastructure, and the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), allowing data and resources from those grids to be shared. =Study= The grid's architecture has been studied by many researchers in the fields of computer science and information systems. Research about the OSG has been published in Science and Lecture Notes in Computer Science. Funding The consortium is funded by the Department of Energy and National Science Foundation, and has received a $30 million joint grant.

Over the course of his 10-year career he played for the Canton Bulldogs, Cleveland Indians, Washington Senators, Oorang Indians and the Buffalo Bisons. BiographyEarly life= Calac was born on May 13, 1892 to Felicidad Calac and listed Francisco Calac as Pete's father on his enrollment at Carlisle. Some are confused since his grandfather was also named Francisco Calac but there were 3 Francisco Calacs on the census of Rincon at the time of his birth, all of Valley Center, California. Two of Pete's brothers had died of typhoid fever and he had a brother and two sisters living in 1908. A Mission Indian, he was born on a reservation and attended Sherman Indian School in Riverside, Ca. He ran from Sherman home to the reservation two years in a row. The third year he was taken to Riverside and put on a train to Carlisle Indian School. =Carlisle Indian School= Calac came to the Carlisle Indian School located across the country in Carlisle, Pennsylvania on November 16, 1908 at the age of 15. He came to the school via the Union Pacific Railroad with only a third-grade education.http://www.nativevillage.org/Messages%20from%20the%20People/team_that_invented_football.htm Calac left Carlisle in June 1911 and returned to California. He asked to return to Carlisle and was re-enrolled September 22, 1912. At the school, he played competitive football. In 1914 and 1915, he was captain of the football team. He was first elected as the team's captain in 1914 when the team's current captain, Elmer Busch, was forced to resign. Until attending the school, Calac had never played football before and had no knowledge of the game. Calac recalled in Robert W. Wheeler's book, Jim Thorpe: World's Greatest Athlete, that the other players took an interest in him because of his large size. It was then that Jim Thorpe, who would later be recognized as being one of the Top Athletes of the 20th Century. Thorpe and Calac soon became friends and would later play professional football with the Canton Bulldogs and the Oorang Indians. =US Army= After attending West Virginia Wesleyan, Pete returned to California for a visit to family and tribe and enlisted in the Army. He served with the 91st Division, known as the \\"Wild West Division,\\" in France and Belgium during World War I. He returned from the war without a wound. He later stated that \\"I guess I dug in too much\\". However, in article by the Professional Football Researchers Association, Calac was reported to have suffered career threatening wounds during the war but was back at the top of his game by 1922. Football careerCanton Bulldogs= In 1916 with Calac and former Carlisle teammate Jim Thorpe starring, Canton went 9-0-1, won the Ohio League championship, and was acclaimed the pro football champion. The Bulldogs had a repeat of their 1916 season, by winning the 1917 Ohio League championship. Then in 1919 Thorpe and Calac were joined in the backfield by future Hall of Famer Joe Guyon and won their third Ohio League Championship. =Union Quakers= Calac and Guyon joined the backfield of the Union Quakers over the 1921 Thanksgiving weekend for the games against the Conshohocken Athletic Club and the pre-NFL version of the Frankford Yellow Jackets. The 1921 Quakers team won the Philadelphia City Championship.http://home.comcast.net/~ghostsofthegridiron/Quakers2.htm =Washington Senators= The Washington Senators franchise spent only 1 season in the NFL. Once the team left the league at the end of the 1921 season, only three of the team's players would play in the NFL following the very next season. Those players were Benny Boynton, Guyon and Calac. =Oorang Indians= In the winter of 1921, Walter Lingo, an Airedale terrier breeder, brought Thorpe and Calac, to his plantation in LaRue, Ohio to hunt for possum. During that meeting Lingo decided to purchase a franchise in the National Football League. Called the Oorang Indians. The team was composed only of Native Americans and was mostly used as tool to for Lingo to promote his Airedales. The team was not considered to be very good, despite having two future Hall of Famers in the lineup. Lingo was more interested in selling his dogs instead of quality football. As a result, the Indians became more of a novelty act, known for their halftime shows instead of a football team. Calac played the team's halfback for both years of the Indians existence. =Buffalo Bisons= After the Indians folded in 1923. Calac was left in need of a team. He was scooped up by the Buffalo Bisons, who were previously known as the Buffalo All-Americans. The team was sold to a group led by local businessman Warren D. Patterson and Tommy Hughitt, the team’s quarterback, for $50,000. The new owners changed the name of the team to Bisons, and committed themselves to signing big name players in an effort to improve performance both on the field and in attendance. As part of this big name spending spree, Calac was offered a contract to serve as the team's fullback. The combination of Hughitt, Boynton, Eddie Kaw, and Calac gave Buffalo the most potent offensive backfield in the league. In a 13-0 opening day victory over the Columbus Panhandles, managed by future NFL President Joe Carr, Calac was knocked out of the game with a broken nose. While with the Bisons, the team had to travel to Philadelphia for a game against the Frankford Yellow Jackets. Philadelphia, being a large metropolitan area, was unfamiliar territory for several of the rural players. That night several players including Calac and rookie Jim Ailinger (best known as being the last surviving player from the NFL's early era) went out to a restaurant for dinner. According to Ailinger, he was unfamiliar with what to order in a restaurant, so he sat right next to Calac, who was a veteran player. The waiter asked Pete what he wanted and he said, \\"A lot of meat and a lot of potatoes.\\"http://www.angelfire.com/sports/Buffalolegend/ Family Pete and his wife were reported to have been married since 1924. They had a son, 2 daughters and 7 grandchildren. Their son, following in Pete's footsteps, played high school football in Canton. Afterwards he became a member of the police force. According to his obituary, Pete Calac died on January 30, 1968. Legacy Grantland Rice, Dean of American Sportswriters, once wrote, \\"I believe an All-American, All-Indian Football team could beat the All-Time Notre Dame Team, the All-Time Michigan Team, or the All-Time anything else.

Early life Alon was born Josef Plaček on kibbutz Ein Harod to Jewish immigrants from Czechoslovakia, Siegfried 'Friedl' and Thekla Plaček. When he was two, his family returned to Czechoslovakia, where they settled in Teplice, in the Sudetenland. Following the Munich Agreement, which resulted in the annexation of Sudetenland to Nazi Germany, Alon and his family moved to Prague. On the eve of World War II, Alon's father sent 10-year-old Josef and his elder brother David to the United Kingdom as part of the Kindertransport program. He was then adopted by George and Jenny Davidson, a childless Christian couple. Most of his family was wiped out during the Holocaust, with his parents being murdered at Auschwitz. Following the war, he returned to Czechoslovakia and attempted to start a career as a jeweler. He then graduated from a vocational school and then enlisted in the Czechoslovak Air Force, where he successfully completed a pilot course. Alon married Dvora Alon (née Kirat), a Jewish immigrant from Yemen, on January 1954. They had three daughters; Dalia (born 1954), Yael (born 1959) and Rachel (born 1968). IAF career In 1947, he volunteered for the first pilots' course in the Sherut Avir, the Haganah's nascent air corps. Soon afterward, he moved back to Mandate Palestine, changed his name to Yosef Alon, and upon Israeli independence in 1948, was among the founding members of the Israeli Air Force.Who killed Joe Alon? Alon fought in the Israeli War of Independence as a fighter pilot and early member of the nascent Israeli Air Force, and would go on to complete 75 missions. In 1953, he became one of Israel's first jet pilots. From 1953 to 1956, he flew Gloster Meteor and Dassault Ouragan aircraft in the Air Force. From August 1960 to August 1961, Alon served as Mystère IV pilot and as Commander of the 101 Squadron, which was equipped with Mystère IV aircraft. On November 1961, he returned to command 101 Squadron as the IAF's first Mirage III squadron. In 1965, after attending command and training course in England, Alon went on to head the Air Force safety industry. The highlights of his career in the IAF was the establishment of the Flying Safety branch and the Hatzerim Airbase, which he commanded from 1966 to 1970. In 1970, then a colonel, Alon was chosen to be the assistant air and naval attache at Israel's Embassy in Washington, DC. Installed in what should have been a three-year assignment, Alon advocated strongly on Israeli arms procurement, especially regarding the F-4 Phantom. He also established close relationship with the American Jewish community, assisted with the activities of United Jewish Appeal and gave lectures to students on Israel’s cause. Assassination Alon’s grave in Kiryat Shaul Military Cemetery On the night of June 30, 1973, Yosef Alon and his wife Dvora went to a dinner party organized for a departing embassy staffer. After two and a half hours of socializing and drinking, at roughly 12:30 am on July 1, the couple entered their Ford Galaxie and drove home to Chevy Chase, Maryland, arriving about a half-hour later. Dvora exited the vehicle and walked a few dozen feet to their porch while Alon gathered up his sports jacket on the back seat. At this moment, Alon was shot five times by a foreign-made .38-caliber revolver, one shot fatally hitting his heart. Dvora rushed inside and called the police, seeing only a light-colored car drive away, and then returned to the front yard and attempted with her 18-year-old daughter Dahlia to stem his bleeding with towels. Alon was taken to a hospital, where he died at 1:27 am. Aftermath Alon’s family accepted President Richard Nixon’s offer to repatriate Alon’s body to Israel, through an USAF C-137 Stratoliner. The aircraft left U.S. from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, arriving at Lod Airport in Tel Aviv, with his family onboard Alon is buried with full military honours at Kiryat Shaul Military Cemetery. =Radio broadcast= Later on July 1, the Cairo-based Voice of Palestine broadcast that \\"After the assassination of martyr Mohammed BoudiaBoudia was killed that June 28. For more see Operation Wrath of God. at the hands of the Zionist intelligence elements in Paris, Colonel Yosef Alon...was executed...His is the first execution operation carried out against a Zionist official in the U.S.\\" =Investigation= The Joe Alon Center, a regional studies institute in the Negev opened in his honor The FBI investigation, \\"Murder of Assistant Air Attache Col. Joseph Alon\\" (MURDA), quickly focused on a possible link with Arab terrorism, including following leads given by the Shin Bet, but was ultimately closed in March 1976 without discovering the perpetrators, according to the Associated Press. Sometime later, the CIA was reported to have been told by \\"Fedayeen senior official\\" that on the orders of Black September, two students, using Lebanese or Cypriot passports, had passed across the Canada–US border and come to Washington, where, with the help of a local professor, they had rented a car and got the weapons for the assassination. Afterwards, the students were reported to have abandoned the rental for another, which they used to get to Dulles International Airport; from there they flew on to the West Coast, East Asia, and finally the Middle East. This information was passed to the FBI in February 1977, but they could make no new progress, and the investigation was closed. The following year, the collected evidence for the case was destroyed by the Baltimore office of the FBI. Dvora Alon died in 1995 without knowing the identity of her husband's killer. Theories In his book Chasing Shadows (Palgrave Macmillan), Fred Burton, former deputy chief of the counterterrorism division of the U.S. State Department's Diplomatic Security Service and Vice-President of the private intelligence and consulting firm Stratfor, concluded after a lengthy investigation that Alon's killer was an agent from Black September who was killed by Mossad in 2011.Was Alon Killed Because He 'Knew Too Much?' The documentary film who killed my dad by Liora Amir-Brmetz aired on the first Channel in Israel on April 2011. The historian Uri Milstein and Colonel Yakov Agassi presented a theory which said that Alon had been assassinated because he unwillingly learned about the conspiracy theory (the Kissinger plan) for the Yom Kippur War which involved collusion between the US, Israel and Egypt and was designed to allow entre for the US into the region as a \\"savior\\" (and future power broker) for both Israel and Egypt by stopping the fighting after previously agreed upon objectives had been achieved. Ezer Weizman answered for the question that \\"Jo was killed because he knew something he should not know about\\" it was because he was getting drunk. The film also describe that Shmuel Gonen had said to Adam Baruch which wrote in his book that he was killed by one of our own because he knew something he should not know about. Uri Bar Joseph had rebuffed the theory and the findings. =Renewed investigation= Due to a lead developed years earlier by journalist Adam Goldman, the FBI reopened the case in January 2017. The new investigation involves information recently given to an agent by Venezuelan terrorist Carlos the Jackal that sometime after 1970 three American veterans sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, one of them a \\"prominent former Black Panther,\\" approached Mahmoud Ould Saleh, a Mauritania-born manager of the Arabic Bookshop on the Rue Saint Victor in the Latin Quarter of Paris and member of the extremist Palestinian \\"rejection front\\" (killed in 1977.) Saleh put them in touch with suspected Black September militant Kamal Kheir Beik (later killed), known to have managed terror attacks including 1975 OPEC siege. Every sale of the gun identified as the murder weapon, a .38-caliber revolver, that was sold east of the Mississippi has previously been identified by the FBI, which is now tracing the purchasers of those guns.

The house, built in 1797-1804 for George Read, Jr., was the largest and most sophisticated residence in the state at the time, and is a significant early example of high-style Federal period architecture. The adjacent formal gardens were laid out in the late 1840s by William Couper, the house's third owner. The property was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2016, and is part of the landmark New Castle Historic District. The house is now owned and operated by the Delaware Historical Society as a museum. House The Read House is located in central downtown New Castle, facing the Delaware River across The Strand midway between Harmony and Delaware Streets. The house's view of the river includes a surviving portion of the wharf of George Read. The house is a 2-1/2 story bric building, with a side gable roof and a stone foundation. It has four chimneys, two built into each end wall, with a curtain wall between. The roof's peak is truncated, the flat top section ringed by a low balustrade. The front face of the roof has two dormers, topped by gabled roofs and covering round-arch windows. The main facade is five bays wide, with sash windows set in rectangular openings, with stone sills and splayed stone lintels. The main entrance is at the center, with flanking sidelight windows and pilasters, and a large half-round transom window above. On the second story above the entrance is a Palladian window, its sections flanked by narrow pilasters. To the rear of the main block are two large ells, giving the house a total area in excess of . The house was built in 1793 for George Read Jr., the son of George Read, one of Delaware's leading statesmen and a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence. The younger Read was a successful lawyer and businessman, whose wealth enabled him to build what was then the largest private residence in the state. Stylistically, it is an important early example of Federal period architecture, taking inspiration from several Adamesque houses built in Philadelphia a few years earlier. Garden After Read's death in 1836, the house was rented briefly by John M. Clayton, another Delaware statesman, while he awaited completion of his new home at Buena Vista. The second owner was William Couper, a wealthy businessman who had grown up next door in the former house of George Read I before making a career in the China trade. Houses adjacent to this one, including the George Read I House, were lost to fire in 1824. Couper used the open space created by the fire to establish a formal garden beginning in 1846. The basic layout of the garden appears to follow Couper's basic plan, although the type of plantings is likely not original. Features of its design include brick walkways that wind between the beds, and two gazebos, placed by the Delaware Historical Society at locations of similar structures seen in late 19th-century photographs. Subsequent history Couper was a bachelor, who occupied the house along with a number of other family members. After his death, they continued to reside in the house until the last, his niece Hettie Smith, died in 1919. The house was then acquired by Philip and Lydia Laird, who were involved in New Castle's early historic preservation movement, and undertook to maintain the property's historic integrity. Lydia Laird bequested the property to the Delaware Historical Society in 1975. The Society has since undertaken a full restoration of the property, and interprets it primarily in the period of the Read ownership, although some rooms reflect the styles of subsequent owners. The house is open Wednesday to Sunday year-round, closed only on some holidays; admission is charged.

The film has been cited as an example of the portrayal of genocide in the film industry. The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section of the 1978 Cannes Film Festival. Plot The film centres on the life of a strong-willed Armenian fighter Nahapet (Sos Sargsyan). In the horrors of the Armenian genocide, Nahapet (whose name means patriarch in Armenian) and others valiantly attempt to defend their village in Turkish Armenia from Ottoman troops but are soon overwhelmed. All his children and his wife, Manushak, are brutally beaten and killed whilst he is tied to a beam and forced to witness the destruction of his village. Left for dead, Nahapet is able to make his way to a bleak and cold village in Aragats (filmed in Dian, Talin), a part of the new state of Soviet Armenia. He is filled with grief and feels unable to move on. With encouragement from his brother-in-law and friend Apro (Frunzik Mkrtchyan), Nahapet reluctantly begins a new relationship with a woman named Noubar (Sofik Sarkisyan). But the pair are estranged from one another from the start and the scenes from the film show candid but silent moments of the two attempting to find ways to build a new lives and trying to survive with what little they have. They plant trees and labour intensively to build a house despite the harsh weather conditions of the region. Nahapet and Noubar gradually realise that their survival and future is linked and both now come to the aid of one another. She reveals to Nahapet that she is pregnant. As Nahapet is working outside one day he hears the wailing of a newborn and rushes to his home's wooden door, collapsing on it with the tears and with the full realisation that building a new future after suffering such deprivations in life is possible. The film ends with him and the other villagers walking with their children as they all take a pledge to plant a new apple tree for each child born in the village. Symbolism Red apples are always seen in flashback sequences during the film, accompanied to the score of 'Dle Yaman', rolling in the hundreds into a lake. Reception British historian David Marshall Lang called the film 'absorbing' and it was broadcast by the BBC in Britain after it was released.

One of the biggest and rarest rubies in the world, it was found in the Dattaw-Mine in Mogok, Myanmar, in 1996. Mogok rubies The red colouring of the rubies is due to colour-generating metallic oxides engrained in the crystalline structures. As the rubies from Mogok have formed in marble surroundings with a low content of iron, they display a particularly intense luminosity, which sets off the natural carmine red of the rubies. The best specimens are of “pigeon-blood” colour and therefore especially rare and precious. Most of the raw rubies are cut in Mogok since the market for cut rubies is much bigger. It is therefore quite unusual for an uncut ruby like the Prince of Burma to leave the country.Schüssel, Roland: Mogok : eine Reise durch Burma zu den schönsten Rubinen und Saphiren der Welt. München: Weise, 2002 Heist in Milan A robbery occurred in August 2008 at which prospective buyers turned out to be criminals. On his way to the appointment, the German gemstone trader was deliberately hit by a car and his briefcase stolen. Severely injured, the trader was taken to hospital while the thieves escaped with the gem. After a joint investigation of German and Austrian authorities three suspects were arrested in a hotel in Villach, Austria on November 4, 2008. The booty, a gemstone collection including the Prince of Burma, was secured.http://www.polizei.rlp.de/internet/nav/10a/presse.jsp?uMen=10a70d73-c9a2-b001-be59-2680a525fe06&sel;_uCon=1f60d8cf-3b84-d11c-5ec3-f110b42f27b4&page;=1&pagesize;=10 Processing Despite the fact that the Prince of Burma has not been heat- treated, it has the unique pigeon-blood red colour characteristic of the rubies from Mogok. Due to the evenly crystallized parts of the Prince of Burma, it might be possible to cut a gem of high quality weighing as much as 300 carat. This would make it one of the biggest cut rubies in the world. It is, however, doubtful if this will be attempted since the uncut Prince of Burma is unique as it is, its sentimental as well as its material value being almost inestimable.

Stanley is most famous as the birthplace of the acclaimed Canadian poet Alden Nowlan.  History  Stanley's first settler was New England planter John Smith, who in 1760 established a village on the banks of the Kennetcook River. He was quickly followed by John Anthony (1761) and James Campbell (1772).Charles Bruce Fergusson. Place-names and Places of Nova Scotia, Public Archives of Nova Scotia, Halifax: 1967. After the American Revolution, the area became part of Douglas Township (1784) and was settled by soldiers of the British 84th Regiment. In 1883 the community was renamed for Governor General Stanley, after whom the Stanley Cup of the National Hockey League is also named. During the Second World War (1939–45), the community became the site of Stanley Airport, which the Royal Canadian Air Force used from March 17, 1941 until January 14, 1944, throughout the Battle of the St. Lawrence. Many of the citizens of Stanley assisted the war effort by actively supporting the RCAF in training Commonwealth pilots. Barracks were built for 360 trainees and support staff. The hangar erected to house the aircraft became the largest building in Hants County. Currently, the airport is maintained by the Stanley Sport Aviation group.Kevin Layden, Stanley Fly-in, 2015.

Self-educated for much of his life, he dropped out of school in grade five. He taught himself to read by befriending a librarian at the Library in Windsor, Nova Scotia; a plaque in the Windsor library is dedicated to him. He graduated as a teenager from a two-week program offered by the Folk School in the Kennetcook Hotel, Kennetcook, Nova Scotia (February 1953). First published at age 19, he went to work for the Hartland, New Brunswick Observer and later for the Saint John Telegraph-Journal.

A quarterland is an old land division in the Isle of Man, which includes a farmstead or Kerroo within the quarterland. In this system four of these divisions became a treen and land rights were entrusted to a landholder, who in turn cultivated one of the quarterlands.

They are securities printed by the finance ministry of the relevant country.  Security measures  Excise stamps are often as detailed in their design as banknotes - usually made from the same type of paper and containing holograms and other anti-counterfeit devices. The reason for such measures is that excise duty is extremely expensive, in most EU countries accounting for around half the market price of the product.  Usage  Excise stamps are most commonly found on tobacco and alcohol products, which reach the consumer in neatly packaged units (namely packets and bottles) to which the adhesive stamp is easily affixed.Unlike petrol, for example, which, despite being subject to excise, has no packaging to which a stamp may be affixed, nor is it exposed to the same dangers of counterfeiting as are alcohol and tobacco. Since counterfeit alcohol and cigarettes are extremely common in many countries, the presence of a genuine excise stamp also goes some way towards guaranteeing the genuineness of the product, as only certified producers may legally buy excise stamps. (However, illegally obtained or counterfeit stamps are common in some countries.) Manufacturers will buy a certain quantity of excise stamps from the government at their excise value which they are then obliged to affix to every packet of cigarettes or bottle of spirits produced. The excise stamps are ideally affixed with strong glue over the cap of a bottle or across the lid of a box of cigarettes (and underneath the plastic/foil wrapper on the bottleneck or the cellophane of the cigarette-box) in such a way that they are destroyed when the product is opened. This is so that they cannot be reused, since this would constitute contraband. In countries where excise stamps are required, all cigarettes and alcohol produced legally will bear a stamp. Some countries have separate stamps for domestically-produced and imported excisable goods; others require separate stamps for products destined for duty-free sale, which are still subject to excise but not VAT; some countries do not require stamps for wines, while others do.  In the United Kingdom  In the UK, excise stamps have been in use for spirits since 2006.(view image) While these are usually printed on the back label of the bottle by the manufacturer rather than being a special security bought from the government, they still have to adhere to strict specifications, such as containing UV-visible inks.UK Duty Stamps Scheme, June 2006, retrieved Feb 2009. UK law does not require such physical stamps for cigarettes, either - instead, the words \\"UK Duty Paid\\" are printed in bold on all packs as part of the manufacturing process, while other forms of control are implemented by HM Revenue & Customs to verify that this is indeed the case. Meanwhile, foreign-bought cigarette packets bearing revenue stamps can be widely seen across the UK, mainly due to the comparatively high price of British cigarettes, leading people to (often illegally) import them from abroad.

Before ascending to the See of Bremen His name is given as Albrecht in the genealogies of the House of Welf. He was a son of Magnus I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, of Principality of Wolfenbüttel and Sophia of Brandenburg-Stendal. Albert gained prebendaries as canon of the then Catholic cathedralMagdeburg's cathedral () St. Mauritius and St. Catherina is today an Evangelical church within the Evangelical Church in Middle Germany. While St. Sebastian serves as Magdeburg's present Roman Catholic cathedral () of the modern Roman Catholic Diocese of Magdeburg. in Magdeburg (then in the Prince-Archbishopric of Magdeburg) and as provost at the church of St. Pauli in Halberstadt (then in the Prince-Bishopric of Halberstadt). Pope Clement VI had appointed Albert's predecessor Godfrey of Arnsberg, violating the Prince-Archbishopric's constitution, which reserved the privilege to elect the Prince-Archbishop to the Bremian Chapters of Bremen Cathedral and Hamburg Concathedral (with three votes). The Chapters for their part had elected Bremen's dean, Maurice of Oldenburg as Prince- Archbishop.Maurice was killed in action near Blexen in 1368, while invading Rüstringen for his brother Conrad I, Count of Oldenburg. Both were sons of John II, Count of Oldenburg and his wife Hedwig of Diepholz, thus they were nephews of Otto of Oldenburg. Cf. Adolf Hofmeister, \\"Adel, Bauern und Stände\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: pp. 195–240, here p. 211. Maurice served already since 1345 as administrator of the Prince- Archbishopric, appointed under his uncle then Prince-Archbishop Otto I (reigned 1345–1348).Konrad Elmshäuser, \\"Die Erzbischöfe als Landesherren\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: pp. 159–194, here p. 180. . In a stalemate both agreed, that Godfrey would bear the title and Maurice wield the power, thus Godfrey confirmed Maurice as administrator and appointed him coadjutor, a position which usually included the expectancy of succession to the See. Later Godfrey, frustrated about Maurice' superior role, allied himself with Count Gerhard III of Hoya. The Count waged war on Maurice but the Prince-Archbishopric – with considerable support by Bremen – turned out to enjoy the fortunes of war and thus became a threat to the County. In 1358 Count Gerhard took some burghers of Bremen as hostages. Thus Count Gerhard called on Duke Magnus, the eastern neighbour of the Prince-Archbishopric, for help. But Magnus demanded a reward, and – Gerhard meanwhile in a desperate situation – promised to help providing Magnus' son Albert with the Bremian See. Thus Count Gerhard had to convince his ally Godfrey to resign. Albert as Prince-Archbishop of BremenGaining power and homage of the cities= Among the capitulars there was still a majority for their candidate Maurice, whom they had elected in the first place. Thus Magnus and Albert needed the help of Pope Innocent VI, to get Albert appointed as the new Archbishop, again violating the Prince-Archbishopric's constitution and circumventing the Chapter. Albert was backed by the Guelphs and they achieved his papal appointment on 17 July 1360. In 1361 the Chapter accepted Albert as Prince- Archbishop after negotiations in Walsrode. Thus Albert called himself Albertus electus et confirmatus, even though this was the wrong chronology, since he had first been papally confirmed, lacking the capitulars' election, which he could heal by their acceptance in the year after. From 1362 on Albert sealed deeds using the title Prince-Archbishop of Bremen. But obviously Gerhard did not quite succeed to make Godfrey resign. In 1362 he still sealed deeds as Prince-Archbishop of Bremen. And also Maurice refused to give up, supported by the city of Bremen. Thus Albert wanted to assert himself against Maurice. In 1361 Stade's and Buxtehude's burghers and the free peasants of Altes Land welcomed Albert as new Prince-Archbishop. Generally the Landsgemeinden of the free peasants in the low marsh lands lived undisturbed under Albert's rule. In 1362 representatives of the burghers of the city of Bremen rendered homage to Albert at his fortress in Langwedel. In return Albert confirmed the city's privileges and brokered a peace between the city and the Count Gerhard III. The city was allowed to bail out the hostages held in Gerhard's captivity. In 1365 an extra tax, levied by the city council to finance the ransom, incited uproar of burghers and handcrafters, bloodily suppressed by the city council. Meanwhile, Maurice had entrenched in the prince-archiepiscopal fortress in Vörde. Only after Albert's brothers Magnus II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and Louis, and the latter's father-in-law William II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and their troops had beleaguered the fortress in January 1362, Maurice signed his resignation.Konrad Elmshäuser, \\"Die Erzbischöfe als Landesherren\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: pp. 159–194, here p. 182. . In the following year Albert helped his second cousin Adolph VII, Count of Holstein-Kiel, and the city of Hamburg to free the streets northeast of the city from the brigandage by Eric II, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, and Albert V, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, conquering the latter's castle in Bergedorf. In 1363 Albert concluded with the cities of the prince-archbishopric, Bremen, Buxtehude, Stade, and Wildeshausen as well as the free peasants of Osterstade a contract, organising the financing and provision of soldiers in case of war.Adolf Hofmeister, \\"Adel, Bauern und Stände\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: Mittelalter (1995), pp. 195–240, here p. 219. =Deteriorating relations to the cities in the Prince-Archbishopric= Albert's government was objectless. In 1366 Albert tried to take his advantage from the dispute between the council of the city of Bremen and the gilds, whose members expelled some city councillors from the city (Hollemann's Turmoil). When these councillors appealed to Albert for help, many handcrafters and burghers regarded this treason against the city of Bremen. Appealing at princes would only provoke them to abolish city autonomy. In the night of 29 May 1366, Albert's troops invaded the city. After this the city had to render him homage again, the then wooden Bremen Roland, symbol of the city's autonomy, was burned and a new city council was appointed. In return the council granted Albert a credit amounting to the enormous sum of 20,000 Bremian Marks. But city councillors, who had fled to the County of Oldenburg gained support of the Count Conrad II, who recaptured the city for them on 27 June 1366. The members of the intermittent council were regarded traitors and beheaded and the city's autonomy restituted. Thereupon, the city of Bremen, since long rather holding an autonomous status, and the Bremian city of Stade acted almost in complete independence from the Prince-Archbishop. Albert failed to subject the city of Bremen a second time, since he was always short in money and without support by the Guelphs, who—after William II's death—fought the Lüneburg Succession War against the House of Ascania, imperially designate successor in the Principality of Celle. In 1371 Albert's bailiff in Vörde erected the fortress Slikborch (near Neuhaus upon Oste) at the mouth of the river Oste into the Elbe as a stronghold to wield power over the Land of Kehdingen and to gain a stake in the neighboured Saxe-Lauenburgian exclave Land of Hadeln. In 1378 Albert reconciled with Eric II's son Eric IV, and signed a peace, concluding to settle future disputes – especially on the Land of Hadeln – without using violence.Elke Freifrau von Boeselager, \\"Das Land Hadeln bis zum Beginn der frühen Neuzeit\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: Mittelalter (1995), pp. 321–388, here p. 343. In 1387 the free peasants from Hadeln and Kehdingen demolished the fortress Slikborch as a threat to their autonomy.Adolf Hofmeister, \\"Adel, Bauern und Stände\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: Mittelalter (1995), pp. 195–240, here p. 112. Later Albert did not interfere in interior disputes. In 1380 he kept a low profile, when knights of the family von Mandelsloh and other Bremian and Verdian creditors of Albert tried to gain the pledged estates by violence, ravaging the city of Bremen and the entire Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen. The city of Bremen concluded a pact with the other cities, the Chapter, the Landsgemeinden of the free peasants of the marsh lands, and indigenous families of nobility and ministerialis to fight the exfrediation by the von Mandelslohs. By this pact the mentioned bodies and representatives established as the Estates of the Prince- Archbishopric (; not to be confused with the estates). The cities, the major taxpayers in Prince-Archbishopric, stopped to transfer their taxes to Albert, but paid them to the Estates. In 1381 the troops of the city of Bremen captured the castles in Kranenburg and in Bederkesa, the latter of which it could hold until the mid of the 17th century. In 1386 the city of Bremen made the noble families, holding the estates of Altluneburg (a part of today's Schiffdorf) and Elmlohe, its vassals. The cities and the nobility captured prince-archiepiscopal positions, since Albert was powerless. =Albert's spendthrift lifestyle and loss of power= Albert cultivated a prodigal lifestyle. He pledged prince-archiepiscopal estates in order to gain credits to finance his lifestyle. In 1369 the city of Bremen lent him against the collateral of his mint and his privilege of coinage, from then on run by the city council. In 1375 Albert pawned the bailiwick of Haseldorf north of the river Elbe to Adolph VII, Count of Holstein-KielGötz Landwehr, \\"Das Fortwirken mittelalterlicher Rechtsübertragungen in der Gegenwart“, in: Der praktische Nutzen der Rechtsgeschichte: zum 8. September 2001, (ed.), Heidelberg: Müller, 2003, pp. 277-314, here p. 280. . and in 1377 Stedingen to Count Conrad II. Both territories were thus alienated and—as seen from the retrospect—ultimately lost for the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen. In 1368 Albert pledged his revenues from his residence, the castle in Vörde and the dues levied in the pertaining bailiwick, as well as those levied in Altes Land, Land of Kehdingen, and the parish district of Osten – all south of the Elbe – to his brother Magnus, holding the Principality of Wolfenbüttel and William II (Principality of Celle) for 4,150 Bremian Marks. On their instigation Albert appointed Daniel von Borch as administrator of the Prince- Archbishopric. In 1389 the cities of Bremen, Buxtehude and Stade redeemed these pledges. They kept them for their own, gaining a powerful position in the Prince-Archbishopric, pushing its actual ruler aside. The cities appointed Albert's nephew Otto as regent of the Prince-Archbishopric, seated in Vörde.After Albert's death in 1395 Otto succeeded his uncle as Prince- Archbishop Otto II against the will of the Bremian Chapters. Cf. Thomas Vogtherr, \\"Bistum und Hochstift Verden bis 1592\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: Mittelalter (1995), pp. 279–320, here p. 302. In 1391 Albert resigned himself to the Prince-Archbishopric's regent, his nephew Otto, who meanwhile had become the Prince-Bishop of Verden, concluding by way of contract that they would settle disputes without using violence. In 1389, however, Albert pawned the revenues of the bailiwick of Hagen im Bremischen to Conrad II in return for another credit of 500 gold guilders.Adolf Hofmeister, \\"Adel, Bauern und Stände\\", in: see references for bibliographical details, vol. II: Mittelalter (1995), pp. 195–240, here pp. 112 seq. =Humiliation of Albert II= In 1376, in the course of the Lüneburg Succession War (1370–1388) Johann von Zesterfleth, then dean of the Bremian Chapter, entered into psychological warfare and publicly alleged Albert were a hermaphrodite. To calm the public mood against him, Albert could not help it, but had to undergo body checks in different places within the Prince-Archbishopric, the greatest scandal, which hit the Prince-Archbishop. Albert was the last in a row of Prince-Archbishops of the 14th century who ruined the Prince-Archbishopric. Albert bequeathed an indebtedness and a turmoil unheard of, pushing the Prince-Archbishopric deeply into decay.

Rudd was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. As a young man, he served as a missionary for the LDS Church in New Zealand, where his mission president was Matthew Cowley. For part of his mission he served as secretary to, and traveling companion of, Cowley. After he returned from his mission he married Marva Sperry. The marriage was performed by LDS Church apostle Harold B. Lee, who had been Rudd's stake president when he was a child. Rudd ran his own poultry business. He was made a bishop in the LDS Church by the time he was 25. After running his own business for about 12 years he was recruited by Lee to be a full-time employee of the Welfare Program of the LDS Church, eventually becoming the manager of Welfare Square and over other operations. From 1966 to 1969 Rudd was the president of the church's Florida Mission, which was headquartered in Orlando. In this capacity he was also the church leader of the members that then lived in the islands of the Caribbean. Rudd later served for four months as mission president in the New Zealand Wellington Mission, following the death of the previous mission president.listing of mission presidents in New Zealand In 1987, Rudd became a member of the church's First Quorum of the Seventy; at the time, he was specifically called for a limited time of service. In 1989, along with the other general authorities serving for limited periods of service, Rudd was transferred to the newly formed Second Quorum of the Seventy. He was released from this position and as a general authority in 1992.“The Sustaining of Church Officers,” Ensign, November 1992, p. 20.In April 2016, those released from the Second Quorum of the Seventy - and by extension, those previously released from that quorum - were not just honorably released, as they had been in the past. They were instead designated as emeritus general authorities. As a result, references about his death note him as being a General Authority Seventy. Rudd was president of the Hamilton New Zealand Temple from 1984 to 1987. Rudd is the author of the book \\"Pure Religion,\\" which details the history of the welfare programs of the LDS Church. The book was the result of his efforts to write some material regarding the history of the church's welfare program, at the request of the First Presidency. The book was published in September 1995. Rudd died on December 30, 2016 at the age of 98. LDS Church president Thomas S. Monson spoke at Rudd's funeral. Monson and Rudd had served as bishops in the same stake when they were younger.

Four prototypes of the HKp 902 chassis were built, two of which had Rheinmetall-Borsig's L/40.8 gun mounted in an open- topped, low-profile turret.Chamberlain & Doyle, p. 187 The gun had an elevation range between −8° and +20°. It fired a K.Gr. rot Pz. (APCBC) shell with a muzzle velocity of and a Sprenggranate (HE) shell at . It carried 35 rounds on board. The armor protection, designed to be proof against armour- piercing bullets, was thick on the vehicle's front, and on the sides, on the rear, on the superstructure roof and on the belly.Jentz, p. 26  Service history  The two prototypes were completed in 1941 and they were organized into a platoon for troop trials with Panzerjäger-Abteilung (\\"Anti-Tank Battalion\\") 605 of the Afrika Korps. The first vehicle was reported received on 17 January 1942 by Panzerjäger-Abteilung 605, but the second was not reported as arrived in Tripoli until 23 February 1942. The platoon was transferred to the Kampfstaffel des Oberbefehlshaber Panzerarmee Afrika (Rommel's personal battle group) on 8 March 1942. Only one vehicle was reported operational on 25 May at the start of Operation Venezia during the Battle of Gazala; the other had been captured by the British, shown in undated photographs. Shortly afterwards, on 5 June, the Kampfstaffel reported that the other vehicle had been lost after knocking out three tanks. No further references were made to the Pz.Sfl.

Afterwards After the war, Woolsey returned to Connecticut and worked as a consulting forester, a lecturer at Yale's forestry school, as well as with several national forestry organizations and conservation groups. Family life Theodore Woolsey Jr. married Ruby Hilsman Pickett of Dawson, Georgia, on March 15, 1908. They had five daughters, two of whom were born outside the United States in Switzerland and France, respectively.

Part 1 first aired on November 11 and Part 2 aired on November 18, 2001, on Fox in the United States. The episodes were written by executive producers Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz. \\"Nothing Important Happened Today I\\" was directed by Kim Manners and \\"Nothing Important Happened Today II\\" was directed by Tony Wharmby. The episode helped to explore the series' overarching mythology and earned a Nielsen rating of 6.5 and was viewed by 10.6 million viewers, whereas the second part earned a rating of 5.9 and was viewed by 9.4 million viewers. Critical reception to the episode was largely mixed. The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). \\"Nothing Important Happened Today\\" is a storyline milestone for the series. It introduced both the story arc about baby William which would continue to develop throughout the ninth season and AD Brad Follmer, a recurring character for the show's ninth season. Part 1 deals with the investigation of Deputy Director Alvin Kersh by special agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Doggett's related investigation into the death of EPA official Carl Wormus. In Part 2, Scully, Reyes, and Doggett are led to a ship, where they find evidence of experimentation on human embryos. The episode was supposed to mark the first appearance of recurring regular Lucy Lawless as Shannon McMahon, a female Super Soldier, but Lawless' high-risk pregnancy prevented her from returning to the show after these episodes. These episodes marked, however, the first appearance of recurring regular, Cary Elwes as Brad Follmer, an FBI Assistant Director. According to an apocryphal legend, the phrase \\"Nothing Important Happened Today\\" comes from King George III's supposed diary entry on 4 July 1776, the same day that America declared Independence from Britain. PlotPart 1= Carl Wormus, an EPA official, picks up a beautiful woman, Shannon McMahon (Lucy Lawless), in a Baltimore bar. While he is driving her home, she forces the car off a bridge and holds Wormus underwater until he drowns. Later, Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) meets FBI Assistant Director Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes) in his office, where he hands her two videotapes from the night Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) son was born. The tapes show no evidence of the paranormal events John Doggett (Robert Patrick) has reported. Doggett goes to Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) apartment to consult him, but finds it empty. Meanwhile, McMahon surfaces at a water reclamation plant and drowns a worker there. Scully refuses to disclose Mulder's whereabouts to Doggett, Meanwhile, Assistant Director Walter Skinner urges him to drop his investigation of Deputy Director Alvin Kersh's (James Pickens, Jr.) actions against the X-Files. Doggett tries to contact some of his old friends from the Marine Corps to find out what happened to Knowle Rohrer (Adam Baldwin); one of them turns out to be McMahon. Meanwhile, at FBI headquarters, an unseen figure slips Wormus' obituary to Reyes. Scully's baby causes the mobile of his crib to spin without touching it. Scully is shocked, contacts Doggett, and tells him to continue his investigation. Scully also performs an autopsy on Wormus' body, where she finds fingerprints on his ankle. After leaving, Scully and Reyes see McMahon, who removes the body from the morgue. Follmer, whom Kersh has ordered to rein in Doggett, arrives at the scene and accuses Scully and Reyes of moving the body. The Lone Gunmen find that Wormus had been receiving data from Roland McFarland, the drowned reclamation worker. Doggett breaks into McFarland's office with Skinner and finds files on monochloramine, a mutation-inducing chemical, before Follmer arrives. Doggett slips into a filtration tank to hide, but is pulled deep underwater by McMahon. = Part 2 = The naval captain (Ryan Cutrona) delivers a communication to Dr. Nordlinger (Jeff Austin), who orders the vessel returned to its base. Follmer leaves the water reclamation facility after failing to spot Doggett, who is still underwater; McMahon keeps him alive by passing air from her lungs into his. Back at FBI headquarters, Reyes is warned by Follmer to distance herself from Doggett and his investigation of Kersh. Reyes believes that Follmer simply wants to force Doggett out of the FBI and storms out of the office. Doggett wakes up at his home to find McMahon, who tells him that both she and Knowle Rohrer are invulnerable Super Soldiers developed by a military program. Doggett calls Scully to his house, and McMahon tells them that the program is to be expanded by adding chloramine to the water supply. Meanwhile, at the ship, now docked in Baltimore, the captain attempts to call Wormus. Rohrer approaches the captain, informing him that he is now second-in-command and demanding information on the vessel's mission. The body of the original officer is found in the water nearby. Scully examines McMahon and finds her to be physically normal. Doggett is then suspended by Kersh and Follmer. Reyes tries to find out more about McMahon's history and learns that she is a Justice Department employee who had been contacted by Wormus and McFarland in their attempts to expose the plans to contaminate the water supply. The Lone Gunmen intercept the captain's call to Wormus, on which Rohrer is eavesdropping. The captain then pulls a gun on the Navy Seal guarding the lab, demanding that Nordlinger surrender the project's data. He does not notice Rohrer creeping up behind him. Scully, Reyes and Doggett go to the ship, where they are confronted by Rohrer. Just as Rohrer is about to crush Doggett's skull, he is decapitated by McMahon. Rohrer is presumed dead, but soon awakens and stabs McMahon. Both bodies tumble into the water. The three agents board the abandoned ship and find the captain's decapitated body. Scully gains access to the lab and finds evidence of manipulation of ova. However, she is forced to leave when Doggett finds a time bomb on the bridge. The agents narrowly escape the explosion. Later, Doggett confronts Kersh, who was not implicated in the conspiracy. Kersh explains to Doggett that he left the evidence that helped Doggett, and that he had told Mulder to flee, but ultimately it was Scully who actually convinced Mulder to do so. Meanwhile, Scully dreams of McMahon's and Rohrer's lifeless bodies below the harbor. Suddenly, she sees McMahon's eyes snap open. Scully wakes up and the episode cuts to William's mobile; it begins to move on its own accord. Production Lucy Lawless portrayed Shannon McMahon. The phrase \\"Nothing Important Happened Today\\" comes from an apocryphal legend that King George III's wrote the phrase in his diary on 4 July 1776, the same day that the United States declared Independence from Britain.Shearman and Pearson, p. 260.Kellner, p. 154 The style of the opening credits in \\"Nothing Important Happened Today\\" was changed from the original credits, which, more or less, had been the same for the previous eight seasons. The credits included new graphics as well as new cards for Annabeth Gish and Mitch Pileggi. The tagline for Part 2 is \\"Nothing Important Happened Today\\", replacing the usual phrase \\"The Truth is Out There\\". The first part of the episode marks the first appearance of Assistant Director Brad Follmer, who was named after Chris Carter's writing assistant. Five different actors portrayed Baby William: Rikki Held, Rowdy Held, Ashley Knutson, James Riker and Travis Riker. The character Roland McFarland (played by John Casino), who was murdered in the episode, was named after Fox Broadcasting Company's Vice President of Standards and Practices (Roland McFarland). In an interview, McFarland commented, \\"It's part of the price you pay for being an irritant. The producers have finally found a way to kill me off!\\" After learning about the 2001 cancellation of Xena Warrior Princess, Lawless was approached by the producers of The X-Files for a spot on the show. According to Lawless, one reason why she made an appearance on the show was that her daughter was a \\"mad X-Files fan\\". She further commented that she knew about the show and based her character Xena on Fox Mulder. Originally, Shannon McMahon was to be a recurring character and was due to be featured in \\"The Truth\\", the series finale of The X-Files. However, Lawless, who has a history of miscarriages, became pregnant shortly after part two of these episodes was filmed; her high- risk pregnancy prevented her returning to the series for future episodes. Carter called Lawless \\"hot stuff\\", saying it was \\"fun\\" having a female Super Soldier, something that had never occurred to him or to the show's production crew. In the first underwater scene, most of which was shot at the water tank at Universal, Lawless had to be seat-belted into a car that was supposed to be submerged thirteen feet. In actuality, the water tank was four feet deep. Lawless, being six feet tall, had to kneel and breathe into a hookah while filming the scene. For the special effects team, one of the hardest parts of the episode was to hide the fact that Lawless was wearing a swimming suit. Reception New York Comic Con during the X-Files autograph session with Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz, creators of The X-Files. =Ratings= \\"Nothing Important Happened Today, Part 1\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 6.5 share, meaning that it was seen by 6.5% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, of the nation's estimated households. The episode was viewed by 10.6 million viewers and ranked number 55 for the week ending November 11 and subsequently became the second most watched episode of the ninth season behind the series finale \\"The Truth\\". Part 2 earned a rating of 5.9. The episode was viewed by 9.4 million viewersKessenich, p. 193 ranked number 63 for the week ending November 18. The first part of the episode, which aired on Sunday, November 11, competed with Saving Private Ryan which aired on ABC. The second part of the episode earned the lowest rating on the night of November 18, receiving lower ratings and viewership numbers than The Simpsons and Malcolm in the Middle. When talking about the ninth season, Carter stated, \\"We lost our audience on the first episode. It's like the audience had gone away, and I didn't know how to find them. I didn't want to work to get them back because I believed what we are doing deserved to have them back\\". The episode was later included on The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 – Super Soldiers, a DVD collection that contains episodes involved with the alien super soldiers arc. =Reviews= The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Daryl H. Miller of Los Angeles Times wrote positively of the episode, claiming it is \\"craftily written, solidly acted and moodily photographed\\". Michael R. Farkash of The Hollywood Reporter gave the first part of the episode a largely positive review. Farkash called it \\"entertaining and appealing\\" and noted its \\"suspenseful plot twists and fascinating visuals\\". An unnamed staff writer of Airlock Alpha was mostly positive about the episode, with the exception of Cary Elwes as Brad Follmer, calling Elwes' acting \\"forced\\". Rob Lowman from the Los Angeles Daily News said that Carter had been able to \\"breathe new life\\" into the series mythology arc, and had a positive view of Lucy Lawless' performance. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+. Starpulse named the changed credits the \\"Most Shocking Moment\\" in the series run, writing that the most drastic moment \\"came with the opening credits for season nine, a complete re-design that saw Annabeth Gish and Mitch Pileggi added to the opening sequence and the familiar graphics totally scrapped. These credits looked like they belonged to a different series and at that point, it was.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the first part a \\"C\\", and the second part a \\"C–\\". She argued that the series was unable to figure both out how to re-situate itself after the events of September 11, and deal with the permanent departure of Duchovny. Ultimately, she wrote that the episodes as a whole represent \\"a limp piece of storytelling that has maybe enough good ideas for three-quarters of an episode but is stretched across two for no particular reason.\\" M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, was highly critical of the script, arguing it was difficult \\"to pinpoint any significant moments that occur during either episode\\", but he did praise the production team's execution of \\"some impressive set-pieces.\\" Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated both episodes one star out of five.Shearman and Pearson, p. 261 In a review of the first part, the two noted that \\"this isn't quite the dullest season opener to The X-Files [but] this episode […] has all the passion of a wet Monday morning.\\" In a review of the second half, the two noted, \\"there is at least the semblance of drama here, but this second episode isn't significantly better than the first.\\" Marisa Guthrie from the Boston Herald felt that Gillian Anderson's character, Dana Scully had been \\"rendered impotent\\".

","title":"Nothing Important Happened Today"},{"id":"21776705","text":"\\"Dæmonicus\\" is the third episode of the ninth season of the American science fiction television series The X-Files and the show's 185th episode overall. It first premiered on the Fox network in the United States on December 2, 2001. The episode was written and directed by executive producer Frank Spotnitz. The episode is a \\"monster-of-the-week\\" episode, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the mythology, or overarching fictional history, of The X-Files. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 5.5 and its premiere was viewed by 5.80 million households. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics. The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett, Reyes, and Scully investigate a series of bizarre killings that seem to be due to demonic possession but which Doggett believes is a hoax. The agents soon meet Josef Kobold (James Remar), a man who seems to be playing some sort of demonic game. \\"Dæmonicus\\" was written by Spotnitz to develop the new settings for the show's Monster-of-the-Week episodes, as well as the series in general. One of the major steps taken was to move Scully from the X-Files office to the FBI Academy at Quantico. When creating Josef Kobold, the episode's antagonist, Spotnitz researched various crimes and criminals, until he learned about Caryl Chessman, a man who had been sentenced to death on a technical charge of kidnapping. Series co-star Robert Patrick had issues remembering and delivering his lines, due to the theme of demonic possession, which reportedly made him uneasy.  Plot  Following a bizarre double-murder with Satanic ritual overtones in Weston, West Virginia, John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) are offered the case. Doggett and Reyes ask Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to do an autopsy on the murder victims. The agents come to the conclusion that one of the murder victims was somehow tricked into killing his wife, while evidence at the scene points to two perpetrators. A single clue, the word \\"Daemonicus\\", is left spelled out on a Scrabble board the victims had been playing before being attacked. When Reyes claims to have felt the presence of evil, Doggett responds with great irritation. Dr. Monique Sampson calls them, saying that the murders may be connected to an escaped mental patient, Dr. Kenneth Richman, and a guard, Paul Gerlach. Meanwhile, in a wooded area, the two perpetrators, both wearing demon masks, face each other some twenty paces apart. One of the perpetrators raises his gun and shoots the other. At the mental institution, the two agents interview Josef Kobold (James Remar), the neighbouring patient of Richman. The answers Kobold gives are unsettling for the agents, as he says that one of the perpetrators has killed again, showing them the location and warning them of \\"something horrible\\" happening there. After the dead perpetrator's body is recovered, Scully performs an autopsy and discovers that the body belongs to Gerlach. The agents ask Kobold for help finding the remaining perpetrator. When speaking to Kobold, he suddenly speaks in a strange backward whispering and erupts in convulsions. Reyes hears the word \\"medicus,\\" meaning \\"physician.\\" After putting Kobold in the custody of another guard named Custer, Doggett and Reyes race to Sampson's home and find her dead, with a dozen hypodermic needles jammed into her face. During a one-on-one confrontation, Kobold taunts Doggett about his personal life before vomiting all over him. That night, the power suddenly goes out in the mental institution: Custer approaches Kobold's cell and witnesses him turning into a demon. Doggett phones Scully to tell her that Kobold claims Richman is at an old marina near Annandale, Virginia. Scully drives there, but is attacked by Richman. When Doggett and Reyes arrive, they hear a gunshot from inside an abandoned warehouse. There, they find Richman dead. Scully explains that he was holding her at gunpoint until they arrived, then shot himself. After Scully's lecture to FBI cadets, Doggett explains to her and Reyes that Kobold planned the entire ordeal as a game and got away with it. Explaining that the word \\"Dae/moni/cus\\" was code for the chosen victims' names, in a game Kobold devised to culminate in his eventual escape from the asylum. That the \\"demons\\" angle was merely to get the X-files' involvement and that they were all thoroughly \\"checkmated\\" by Kobold. Reyes, though accepting of Doggett's theories, is still nevertheless disconcerted with the true feeling of evil that she experienced, and believes Doggett was equally out of sorts because, though loath to admit it, he too felt its presence.  Production  Writing and directing = right \\"Dæmonicus\\" was written and directed by executive producer Frank Spotnitz, marking his third credit as a writer and first credit as director for the season. The episode also marked the second time that Spotnitz helmed an episode's directing, with the first being \\"Alone\\". \\"Daemonicus\\" is the first Monster-of-the-Week episode of season nine, meaning a stand-alone episode unconnected to the series' wider mythology; as season nine was promoted as the \\"new\\" X-Files, it was important to develop new settings for the show. One of these new settings was to move Dana Scully from the X-Files office to the FBI Academy at Quantico. The scenes at the FBI Academy were shot at a lecture hall at UCLA. Spotnitz’s wife, Melissa, appears as one of the students in Scully’s class. Spotnitz later called Kobold, the episode's main antagonist, \\"the devil, in a cell.\\" When creating Kobold, Spotnitz researched various crimes and criminals, until he came across the name of Caryl Chessman, who had been sentenced to death on a technical charge of kidnapping. He was then able to connect the word \\"chessman\\" to the idea that, for Kobold, his crimes were all a game. Spotnitz wanted the villain to be a character that \\"could help\\", and not a character that would just tell the viewers \\"what The X-Files was again\\". Series co-star Robert Patrick had issues remembering and delivering his lines due to the theme of demonic possession, which reportedly \\"was freaking\\" him out. He later explained, \\"It was the first time that I couldn't do my lines. Usually I would show up, and they'd always put the camera on me first [but this time] I couldn't do it.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 200 = Filming = The finished episode contains several sequences of Josef Kobold vomiting. Spotnitz had not intended the finished product to feature all the shots but the editor at that time, Chris Cooke, \\"cut it that way.\\" Spotnitz felt that it \\"was so completely over the top.\\" To create the shots, the production crew used tubes which supplied the faux vomit. The tubes were discreetly fitted to actor James Remar's mouth. Remar, in turn, only had to open his mouth during the shooting of the sequence. Spotnitz later joked that he had \\"a thing for vomiting\\".

The episode later aired in the United Kingdom on BBC One on November 17, 2002. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode a \\"C\\" grade rating. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one-and-a-half stars out of five. The two criticized Spotnitz \\"attention seeking direction\\", citing the \\"strange cross fades\\" and \\"exaggerated camera angles\\" as detractors. Furthermore, they were critical about the story, writing that it was \\"all over the place\\". Ultimately, Shearman and Pearson concluded that the entry was an example of \\"this new season [needing] to try a little harder\\" in order to become a success.Shearmand Pearson, p. 262 Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"C–\\" and wrote that while the episode had a lot of gruesome moments, such as the corpses with snakes inside of them and the gristly murders, the \\"meandering structure, over-emphasized grimness, and deadening pace render all of these elements inert\\". He also felt that, after \\"Nothing Important Happened Today\\"—which he called a \\"snooze-fest\\"—\\"Daemonicus\\" was a \\"disheartening [way] to get back to monster of the week episodes\\". Other reviews were more positive. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, said the episode was \\"sluggishly paced\\" but praised the \\"wonderfully tense atmosphere\\" and Spotnitz's \\"stylish directing choices\\". In a season review, Michelle Kung from Entertainment Weekly called the episode \\"worthy\\", but noted that it was overshadowed by the show's \\"ludicrous conspiracy plots\\".

The episode received a Nielsen household rating of 5.1 and was viewed by 8.4 million viewers; it garnered mixed to negative reviews from television critics, with many feeling that it portrayed the series' characters in a way that was unfaithful to the show's history. The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Scully is hopeful about reuniting with her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) when a complete stranger offers new information about what drove him into hiding. Yet her trust in the stranger may place Mulder in even more danger, for the man turns out to be a super soldier. \\"Trust No 1\\" features former leading star Duchovny via the use of previously filmed footage. It was written in response to fans who felt that, during season eight, Mulder's abduction was not dealt with until his miraculous return in \\"This is Not Happening\\"/\\"Deadalive\\". Actor Terry O'Quinn, who appears in this episode as the Shadow Man, had appeared as different characters in the second season episode \\"Aubrey\\" and the 1998 feature film and appeared as Peter Watts in The X-Files sister show Millennium. The tagline for the episode is \\"They're Watching.\\" Plot While at a coffee shop, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) sees an infant crying and sees its mother, Patti, arguing with her husband outside. Scully asks the mother if she is okay, and the mother leaves with her child. Meanwhile, John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) visit Scully at Quantico to tell her about a tipster who wants to contact Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). Doggett encourages Scully to contact Mulder, believing the tipster has the names of the Super Soldiers and could prove vital to tracking them down. The tipster indicates that he is willing to share this information with no one other than Mulder. Scully, fearful for Mulder's safety, falsely claims not to know his whereabouts. A short time later, Scully sees Patti having another argument with her husband, who drives off with their baby in the car. Scully approaches Patti, offering her assistance. Scully convinces Patti to stay over that night in her apartment after learning she has nowhere else to go. Meanwhile, Doggett and Reyes stake out the location where he traced the tipster's call. They see Patti's husband, who they believe to be the tipster, walk inside the apparently abandoned building. Inside, the husband sits at a computer. The Shadow Man (Terry O'Quinn), who appears to be the husband's boss, monitors Scully through surveillance. The next morning, Patti shuts off the baby monitor and removes William from his crib. Scully awakens when she gets a phone call from Doggett warning her that the tipster they were following had just gone into her apartment building. Scully then hears William cry and confronts Patti at gunpoint. Just then, Patti's husband attempts to pick Scully's lock, but is stopped by Doggett and Reyes. The husband informs the agents that they are being watched, and signals to Scully to close the window. He then reveals to Scully that he is an NSA employee with no name. Patti says their daughter is just like William, and they only want to keep both children safe. The husband reveals that his supervisor has discovered the “Super Soldier” project and alludes to crimes against innocent people. He begs Scully to call Mulder out of hiding in order to give him this information. Moments later, the Shadow Man calls Scully and tells her that she contact get Mulder in one day or else he will disappear with the Super Soldiers' identities. Scully refuses unless she can meet with the Shadow Man face-to-face. The Shadow Man gives Scully detailed instructions about how and where to meet him, warning her that even a slight deviation from his instructions would mean that he will never contact her again. The Shadow Man tells Scully to drive west in a series of vehicles until she is told to stop. He also tells her to change into a different outfit that he has in the trunk of the car she is driving; Scully reluctantly complies. The Shadow Man then comes face-to-face with Scully and destroys her vehicle with a remotely detonated bomb. He explains that he has been watching her for quite some time, and that, in addition to her clothing size, he knows everything about her, including \\"that one lonely night you invited Mulder to your bed.\\" Scully finally gives in and contacts Mulder; she tells Doggett that before Mulder left, they had worked out a plan that, if he was to return, he would be arriving by train. Doggett urges Scully to contact Mulder and tell him not to come, fearing that the Shadow Man is setting a trap for him. Scully replies that she wants to see Mulder, and that it is too late to call it off. Reyes, Doggett, and the NSA agent cover Scully at the train station. However, as the train pulls up, the Shadow Man appears and guns down the agent before approaching Scully. Before the Shadow Man can kill Scully, Doggett appears and shoots him twice, sending him falling onto the train tracks, where the train seemingly runs over him. Because there has been a shooting, much to Scully's dismay, a train employee radios to the conductor to keep the train moving and not to stop at that station. While Scully consoles Patti, whose husband just died in Scully's arms, Doggett reports that he cannot find the Shadow Man's body. Scully, fearful that he is a Super Soldier pursuing Mulder, chases after the train with Doggett and Reyes. An employee who works for the train gets a call on his radio, saying that someone jumped off a train and into a rock quarry. Doggett and Reyes chase after someone they believe to be Mulder, while Scully goes deeper into the quarry. There, she is attacked by the Shadow Man. Suddenly, the Shadow Man is destroyed by the magnetite being mined from the quarry. Production right \\"Trust No 1\\" was written by series creator Chris Carter along with executive producer Frank Spotnitz; it was directed by Tony Wharmby. The episode features former leading star David Duchovny via the use of previously shot footage. According to Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles in their book The Complete X-Files, the episode includes themes \\"about Orwellian surveillance.\\" \\"Trust No 1\\" was written in response to fans who felt that, during season eight, Mulder's abduction was not dealt with until his miraculous return in \\"This is Not Happening\\"/\\"DeadAlive\\". Despite this, series director Kim Manners was critical of this take on Mulder, noting, \\"The only thing I thought we didn't do right during seasons eight and nine was that a lot of the shows were about Mulder, and I thought it was a mistake to make a series about a man that wasn't standing in front of the camera.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 201 The email addresses that Mulder and Scully use to communicate with each other were real addresses, created and maintained by Ten Thirteen Productions. The tagline for the episode is \\"They're Watching\\", changed from the usual \\"The Truth is Out There\\". Actor Terry O'Quinn, who appears in this episode as the Shadow Man, had appeared as different characters in the second season episode \\"Aubrey\\" and the 1998 feature film. He had also played a recurring role as Peter Watts on Millennium and appeared in the short-lived series Harsh Realm. O'Quinn later earned the nickname \\"Mr. Ten Thirteen\\", due to his appearance in multiple shows and movies affiliated with Ten Thirteen Productions, the company that produced The X-Files.Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 60  Broadcast and reception  \\"Trust No 1\\" first premiered on the Fox network in the United States on January 6, 2002. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 5.1, meaning that it was seen by 5.1% of the nation's estimated households and was viewed by 5.4 million households, and 8.4 million viewers. It was the 55th most watched episode of television that aired during the week ending March 3. The episode eventually aired in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on December 8, 2002. The episode was later included on The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 – Super Soldiers, a DVD collection that contains episodes involved with the alien super soldiers arc. The episode received mixed to negative reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a B– grade. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two called the entry \\"an exercise in futility […] at best\\" and argued that, because Duchovny had left the series, the sense of excitement that he might have made an appearance in the episode was completely gone. Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson heavily criticized Mulder and Scully's characterization, calling Mulder a character the audience \\"can't recognize any more\\" and Scully a \\"gullible patsy\\".Shearman and Pearson, pp. 264–265 M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, was also critical of the script's treatment of the characters, arguing that Mulder and Scully in this episode \\"sound nothing like the characters we have come to know\\". He also lamented that the episode did not examine the central theme of electronic surveillance in greater detail. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, wrote a largely negative review of the episode. He derided the series for making it appear that Mulder abandoned the woman he loved and his own child. He noted, \\"Just because it walks, talks, and sometimes acts like The X-Files, doesn't make it The X-Files.\\"Kessenich, pp. 195–200  Notes FootnotesBibliography  External links *\\"Trust No 1\\" on The X-Files official website * * \\"Trust No 1\\" at TV.com Category:2002 American television episodes Category:Television episodes set in Maryland Category:The X-Files (season 9) episodes Category:Television episodes set in Virginia Category:Television episodes set in Washington, D.C.

The episode was written by series creator Chris Carter and executive producer Frank Spotnitz, and directed by Carter. \\"Providence\\" helps to explore the series' overarching mythology. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 5.2 and was viewed by 8.4 million viewers. The episode received mixed reviews from critics; some reviewers enjoyed the story and the show's way of integrating an absent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) into the storyline, whereas others felt the plot was ludicrous. The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Scully, distrustful of both Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes), circumvents the FBI's investigation into William's kidnapping and performs her own, assisted by Reyes and The Lone Gunmen. Scully discovers that William has been taken by a UFO cult that believes William is destined to become the savior of mankind, but only if Fox Mulder is still alive. If Mulder is dead, William will lead the forces of evil: the alien invaders. Co-written and directed by Carter, the episode opens with a shot of a fire fight during the Gulf War and the Super Soldiers' involvement therein. Many of the cast and crew were pleased with Carter's directing, including Anderson and Gish. The episode makes reference to rubbings from an alien wreck, a direct continuation from the plots of the sixth season finale \\"Biogenesis\\" and the seventh season opener \\"The Sixth Extinction\\". Plot Retired Lieutenant Colonel Zeke Josepho recounts a strange experience during the Persian Gulf War and how he claims it brought him to God: as his squad was ambushed during the Battle of Al Busayyah and on the verge of defeat, four mysterious men showed up and defeated the enemy with astonishing ease. While Josepho thinks of them as guardian angels, they are revealed to be the almost-indestructible Super Soldiers. In the present, Josepho stands above the wreckage of a spacecraft in Canada. At the FBI, Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes) discloses to a room of agents that Dana Scully’s (Gillian Anderson) son William has been abducted. Follmer notes that The Lone Gunmen are identifying the woman who took the child and ran over John Doggett (Robert Patrick). However, Follmer leaves out any potential motive for these crimes, which causes a frustrated Scully to leave the room. Byers (Bruce Harwood) reveals that he put a cell phone in the baby's belongings so they can track the Overcoat Woman; Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) and Scully head out to find William. The two eventually find William's car seat along with the cell phone in an abandoned SUV. Meanwhile, the Overcoat Woman reports to Josepho that she has William. Scully goes to Agent Robert Comer, whom she was forced to shoot after his attempt on William's life, and uses the alien artifact to heal him. Comer explains that Josepho believes a physical manifestation of God exists inside the spacecraft. According to an ancient prophecy, William is destined to become the savior of humanity, but only if Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is still alive. If he dies, William will instead lead the Colonists. Comer claims that Mulder was supposedly killed by the cult in order for the aliens to successfully invade; he tried to kill William to prevent him from causing humanity's destruction. Suddenly, a nurse and the Toothpick Man (Alan Dale) arrive and ask Reyes and Scully to leave. Comer ends up alone with the Toothpick Man. Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) later reports to Reyes and Scully that Comer has died. Reyes accuses Toothpick Man and others in the room of killing Comer. Meanwhile, Scully visits Doggett, who warns her not to trust the cultists. However, Scully goes to meet Josepho near Calgary. Josepho claims to be protecting William, but demands Mulder's head as collateral in exchange for the baby's release. When Josepho returns to the wreck site, the Overcoat Woman relates that the aperture of the craft began to glow when William started crying. The craft soon rises up out of the ground. Looking on the site from a distance, Scully and Reyes see the craft burst out of an enclosure and into space, lighting the ground beneath it on fire as it goes. The two find an unharmed William among the charred bodies of the cultists. At FBI headquarters, Follmer asks Kersh to remove his name from the final report. Instead, Kersh rebukes him and goes in to see the Toothpick Man, who is revealed to be a Super Soldier. Production The opening scene depicts a fire fight during the Gulf War. A desert area one hour outside of Los Angeles stood in for Iraq, and the scene featured actual U.S. military personnel as extras (U.S. Marines in Iraq pictured). \\"Providence\\" was written by series creator Chris Carter and executive producer Frank Spotnitz. A large portion of the episode, as well as the previous entry, was based on the ancient astronaut theory; a theory that proposes intelligent extraterrestrial beings have visited Earth in antiquity or prehistory and made contact with humans.Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 169 The themes had previously been visited in the \\"Biogenesis\\"/\\"The Sixth Extinction\\"/\\"Amor Fati\\" story arc.Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 202 This episode, as well as the one that proceeds it, plays around with questions concerning traditional religion and faith. About the plot, series co-star Robert Patrick later joked: \\"The baby's the Messiah. I don't understand any of it. I'm Episcopalian; I don't get it.\\" Carter also directed the episode; initially, the episode was supposed to have been helmed by another individual, but no one was ever selected. At the last minute, Carter took on the role. Due to time constraints, Carter was writing whole parts of the script while the episode was being filmed. Many of the cast and crew were pleased with Carter's directing. Gillian Anderson said that she thought \\"Chris has directed some of our best episodes. He's very even tempered, and he's quiet and gentle and quite nice to have as a director, because that energy can't help but pervade the rest of the set […] He's got a clear vision, and he's good at communicating that.\\" Annabeth Gish noted that Carter's directing was \\"very meticulous\\" and that he \\"knows exactly what he wants\\". The episode's opening scene depicts a firefight during the Gulf War. This sequence, which took two days to film, was shot on a dry expanse of land located an hour outside of Los Angeles. This area had been selected due to its resemblance to an Iraqi desert. Series' co-executive producer Michelle MacLaren said: \\"We [MacLaren and location manager Ilt Jones] were way out in the desert and we drove around this corner of these hills and I felt like we had entered another country. It was so desolate, and there were these stone buildings that looked like a bomb had gone off in them. It was perfect.\\" To add authenticity to the shoot, several of the extras used during this scene were former U.S. military personnel.Clubb 2016, pp. 171–175. Unlike many of the sets featured on the show, which were filmed on a Fox soundstage, the shot of the buried alien space craft was actually filmed in the hills near Simi Valley, California. Carter wanted a full-scale mock-up of the alien ship to be buried in the ground. This was unusual for the show; usually, a small portion of the ship would have been buried in the ground and the rest would have been filled in either via digital graphics, or with a scale model. In this episode, however, all the shots of the alien ship, sans the takeoff, were done practically. To create the otherworldly glow of the ship, over 100 lamps were hidden within the craft. The ship was also covered in fictional characters that had been programmed into a computer, printed off as stickers, and then applied to the ship's hull.

They called the entry \\"shallow and pretentious, and internally inconsistent\\" and derided its plot. They wrote that \\"at the centre of [the show's] mythology [is] a situation dependent on Mulder and a baby.

It originally aired on the Fox network on . It was written by Steven Maeda and directed by Kim Manners. The episode is a \\"monster-of-the-week\\" episode, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the mythology, or overarching fictional history, of The X-Files. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 4.8, being watched by 8 million viewers. It has generally received positive reviews from television critics. The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, after being in a car accident, Reyes awakens in a surreal hospital. Doggett and a comatose Reyes struggle to prevent her organ donor card from being acted upon. The two, however, soon discover a unique woman, Audrey Pauley, who has the ability to communicate with both those conscious and unconscious. \\"Audrey Pauley\\" guest starred Tracey Ellis as the title character; she had previously appeared as a major character in the third season episode \\"Oubliette\\". Gish has called the episode one of her favorites to film. In addition, it contained several elaborate stunts and effect sequences, many of which were created in unique manners. Plot After driving home from work, Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) is struck by a drunk driver and transported to a hospital, where she is received by Dr. Preijers (Jack Blessing) and Nurse Edwards; she soon slips into a coma. Reyes, however, wakes up moments later in the same room all alone. Running to the door, she discovers that the hospital is floating in a void. She soon finds two other patients, Stephen Murdoch (Stan Shaw), and Mr. Barreiro (Del Zamora). They assume that they are dead. Reyes, however, maintains that they are still alive. Meanwhile, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) tells John Doggett (Robert Patrick) that Reyes is braindead, a fact that Doggett refuses to believe. Preijers informs Doggett and Scully that, since Reyes was an organ donor, in a few days her life-support will be pulled and the hospital will harvest her remains. In the floating hospital, Reyes sees a woman (Tracey Ellis), standing in the hallway, whom Monica follows, but then the woman disappears. At that moment, Barreiro begins screaming and is engulfed in blue electricity before disappearing. In the real world, it is revealed that Barreiro, a fellow comatose patient, has had his life support removed by Preijers. Nearby stands the mystery woman that Reyes encountered: Audrey Pauley. Doggett begins looking into ways to save Reyes, noting an anomaly in her electrocardiograph that suggests stifled brain activity. While visiting her room, Doggett runs into Audrey who tells him that Reyes' soul is \\"not gone yet\\". Audrey walks to her room in the basement, where a model of the hospital has been built. By concentrating her mind, she is able to move into the floating hospital where Reyes is trapped. Once there, she finds Reyes who asks her to tell Doggett that he's a \\"dog person\\", a reference to a conversation the two had before Reyes' crash. After relaying the message, Doggett is determined that Reyes is not gone and, following Audrey, learns about her hospital model. Meanwhile, Nurse Edwards (Vernee Watson-Johnson) confronts Preijers about an injection she saw him give Reyes; he kills Edwards to cover his tracks. Later, in the floating hospital, Stephen collapses and disappears when he too is pulled off of life support. After Doggett is spotted with Audrey in the basement by Preijers, he begins to worry that she could expose what he is doing. He injects the same drug he used to kill Edwards, but Audrey is able to concentrate and move into the floating hospital one last time. She informs Reyes that her only way out is to jump into the void. Reyes does so and wakes up in her hospital bed moments before her organs are to be harvested. Doggett runs down to Audrey's room only to find that Preijers has killed her. Doggett manages to capture Preijers before he can escape. Production \\"Audrey Pauley\\" was written by Steven Maeda and directed by Kim Manners. The entry was Maeda's second ninth season entry after \\"4-D\\". The episode features guest star Tracey Ellis as the titular Audrey Pauley. Ellis had previously appeared as a major character in the third season episode \\"Oubliette\\". Annabeth Gish later noted that the episode, along with \\"4-D\\", were her \\"two favorite episodes\\" because they \\"are stand-alone episodes about Reyes and Doggett. Wonderful acting challenges, and the stories were fantastic.\\" Robert Patrick, whose friend Ted Demme had recently died, was worried about bringing too much emotion onto the set. He later noted, \\"I was kind of raw. I remember being a little worried about bringing too much emotion to it. I felt safe with Kim; he knew I was going through a tough time.\\"Huwritz and Knowles, pp. 202–204 The episode contained several elaborate stunts and effect sequences. Gish performed all of her stunts in the episode, including one shot when she jumped from a thirty-foot descender. She later called the sequence \\"the biggest stunt of my career.\\"Fraga, p. 215 For several of the special effect shots, Manners was forced to compromise on his original decision. For one shot, in which Audrey Pauley disappears after appearing in front of Gish, Manners had wanted to employ CGI technology. Eventually, the director decided to use practical effects by \\"t[ying] the two actresses [Gish and Ellis] together [...] and then [cutting] to Annabeth and in her face there's an 'oh shit' reaction, and then [panning] straight up on a crane, all right, and see that she's completely alone.\\" He called effects like these \\"creative ways to trim [the] budget.\\"Fraga, p. 216 To create the floating hospital scene, footage shot on a small door set was composited with a CGI hospital. Initially, the scene used a straight flat \\"piece of cement\\" as the bottom of the building. The effects team tried adding a \\"big piece of earth\\" under the building, but Paul Rabwin felt it looked too much like The Little Prince, so the piece of earth was removed. The final result also removed the cement-like base.  Broadcast and reception  \\"Audrey Pauley\\" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 17, 2002, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One on January 26, 2003. The episode's initial broadcast was viewed by approximately 5.1 million households, 8 million viewers, and ranked as the sixty-eighth most watched episode of television that aired during the week ending March 17. \\"Audrey Pauley\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 4.8, meaning that roughly 4.8 percent of all television-equipped households, were tuned in to the episode. The episode has generally received positive reviews from television critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two noted that \\"this is what The X-Files should be doing now\\" and that \\"this would have been the template on which to have built a series starring Doggett and Reyes.\\" Furthermore, they noted that the script was \\"written and directed with so much restraint\\", that it makes many of the emotional scenes \\"more affecting\\". Shearman and Pearson ultimately called the end result \\"clever, thoughtful, […] very moving\\" and \\"beautiful\\".Shearman and Pearson, pp. 269–270 Lionel Green from Sand Mountain Reporter named the episode one of his \\"13 all-time favorite episodes\\" of The X-Files, ranking it at number three. He wrote that the episode was \\"powerful\\" due to its themes of \\"faith, love and sacrifice.\\" He concluded that it was \\"the best one starring the new agents, Doggett and Reyes.\\" M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, praised the performances of Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish while stating that the visuals in the dream sequences were \\"pitch-perfect\\". Jessica Morgan, however, from Television Without Pity, gave the episode a more mixed review. She criticized the character of Monica Reyes and called her \\"Moronica\\". She ultimately gave the episode a C+ grade.

The episode first aired in the United States on March 31, 2002, on the Fox network. The episode was written and directed by executive producer John Shiban. The episode is a \\"monster-of- the-week\\" episode, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the mythology, or overarching fictional history, of The X-Files. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 4.4 and was viewed by 4.64 million households and 7.3 million viewers. It received mixed reviews from critics. The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett is determined to find an error in the DNA evidence that freed the convicted Robert Fassl, the \\"Screwdriver Killer\\", whom he nearly caught in the act 13 years earlier. In the end, it is revealed that Fassl has a mental condition that splits him into two parts: the religious innocent and the vengeful killer. \\"Underneath\\" marked the directorial debut of Shiban, who had been a writer for the series for several seasons. Reportedly, the episode contained \\"so many problems\\" that the Fox executives nearly refused to allow the finished product to air. At the last minute, however, they relented, and allowed the episode to be aired later on in the season, several weeks after its intended air date. Shiban originally wanted to film the sewer scenes in Los Angeles' actual sewer system, but due to the events of September 11, a sewer mock-up was built on Stage 11 at the Fox studios. Plot Thirteen years before the present, Robert Fassl (W. Earl Brown) sits in his van. He later approaches a home and claims to be there to repair the cable. As Fassl holds up a piece of paper to show it to the family who called for the repair, blood spatter splashes across the paper. He looks up and sees the house's occupants with slit throats in pools of blood. Abruptly, two police officers burst into the house and apprehend Fassl. One of the officers who goes to check out the kitchen turns to reveal he is John Doggett (Robert Patrick) as a young NYPD officer. In the present, Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) discusses Fassl's release—due to DNA evidence—with an outraged Doggett. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) confirms that the test results conclusively disprove Fassl as the killer. Meanwhile, outside the courthouse, Fassl notices a mysterious Bearded Man. After being released, he stays in a room belonging to his lawyer, Jana Fain, where he clutches a Rosary beads and prays frantically. When the Bearded Man appears, Fassl begs for the man not to hurt her. While Fain is unharmed, Fassl learns that the housekeeper, Mrs. Dowdy, has gone missing. Fassl finds her body, cleans up the blood, and dismembers her remains to cover up what has happened. Scully tells Doggett that while the DNA test disproves Fassl's culpability, it implicates a possible blood relative; Fassl, however, is an only child. Reyes proposes that the murders are being conducted by an entity rather than a person. Meanwhile, Fassl approaches Assistant District Attorney Damon Kaylor and begs to be sent back to prison. Kaylor refuses, but is killed by the Bearded Man. After hearing of Kaylor's disappearance, Reyes theorizes that Fassl's piety and his unwillingness to acknowledge his darker half has given him the unwanted ability to physically change into another, more violent person. The Bearded Man demands that Fassl kill Fain, beating him up when he doesn't comply. As she tends to Fassl, Fain first sees the Bearded Man in his place. While staking out Fain's house, the agents see the Bearded Man flee. Doggett pursues the Bearded Man while Reyes finds Fain alive. In the pursuit, Reyes falls through into a sewer, where she finds the remains of the Bearded Man's victims. After a struggle with the Bearded Man who is holding Doggett at knife point, Reyes shoots. The Bearded Man falls into the water and Doggett goes after him, only to pull up Fassl, much to his confusion. Reyes tries to remind him that it does not matter as long as the case is solved. Production \\"Underneath\\" was written and directed by executive producer John Shiban. This marked his directorial debut.Hurwitz and Knowles, pp. 236–240 According to Shiban, the series' production staff had \\"actually talked for some time about doing a Jekyll/Hyde story but never quite found a way to do it\\" until the idea to use DNA came into play. Shiban also was inspired by the film The Third Man (1949), which featured a climactic chase through a sewage system. The episode, which explores John Doggett's backstory as a New York City police officer, was described as containing similar themes as those \\"explored on the Millennium series.\\" The episode guest-starred Arthur Nascarella, who was a friend of series co-star Robert Patrick. Patrick was essential in getting Nascarella cast on the show; he later joked \\"I stole [Nascarella's] New York accent in Copland and I stole it to do The X-Files, but I got him cast in The X-Files show.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 204 As the ninth season progressed and the show's ratings began to plummet, Fox became more and more actively involved in the show's style and direction. Although \\"Underneath\\" was the twelfth episode aired, it was actually the ninth episode produced; reportedly, the episode contained \\"so many problems\\" that the Fox executives very nearly nixed the finished product. At the last minute, however, they relented, and allowed the episode to be aired later in the season, several weeks after its intended air date.Kessenich pp. 193–194 Shiban originally wanted to film the sewer scenes in Los Angeles' actual sewer system, but the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power vetoed the idea and stated that \\"there's a moratorium on shooting there since September 11\\", a position that Shiban called \\"understandable.\\" In order to make up for this, series art director Corey Kaplan was tasked with building a sewer replica on Stage 11 at the Fox studios; she used the blueprints from the 1952 version of Les Misérables as an inspiration.  Reception  \\"Underneath\\" first aired in the United States on March 31, 2002, on the Fox network. The episode later debuted in the United Kingdom on February 2, 2003, on BBC One. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 4.4, meaning that it was seen by 4.4% of the nation's estimated households and was viewed by 4.64 million households and over 7.3 million viewers.Kessenich, p. 193 \\"Underneath\\" was the 71st most watched episode of television that aired during the week ending March 31. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode a B– rating. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five, and called the entry \\"solid and efficient\\".Shearman and Pearson, pp. 270–271 The two complimented Shiban's directorial efforts, noting that \\"as a director [he] makes 'Underneath' shine\\", but were critical of some of the \\"trademark X-File moments\\", citing \\"the surprise appearance of a face in the bathroom mirror\\" and \\"the climactic fight in a sewer\\" as examples. Shearman and Pearson, however, wrote positively of Shiban's realistic depiction of Doggett. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, wrote that the episode felt \\"very familiar\\" but was impressed with the production design on the sewer set.

It was written by David Amann and directed by Kim Manners. The episode is a \\"monster-of-the-week\\" episode, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the series' wider mythology, or the overarching fictional history. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 5.1 and was viewed by 7.8 million viewers in its initial broadcast. It received positive reviews from television critics. The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Reyes takes the lead while investigating an X-File case surrounding a man found skinned alive. When she discovers that he had visions of a similar thing, she calls on Scully’s expertise to help with the investigation. \\"Hellbound\\" was written to take Gish's character into a darker area. The episode's plot is similar to mythology surrounding the Aztec agriculture god Xipe Totec. To create the skinned human bodies, the makeup team sprayed a mannequin with layers of latex. The layers were then peeled off and positioned onto other mannequins that had been designed to resemble the actors. The faux skin was created to look \\"moist\\" and was composed of over 200 prosthetic pieces. Plot In Novi, Virginia, a group of ex-convicts, led by Dr. Lisa Holland (Katy Boyer), meet and discuss atoning for their sins. Terry Pruit (Don Swayze) tells the others that, since he has discovered the group, he has made amends for his past. However, another member, Ed (Cyril O'Reilly), tells him that humans are unable to change and that they are both destined for hell. Ed's friend, Victor Potts (David Figlioli), tells Holland that he's been having nightmares involving people being skinned alive. That night, he has a vision of Ed skinned. Several hours later, Victor is murdered. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) asks John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to examine Potts' body. Reyes explains that, because Potts had a premonition of his own death, the case is an X-File. Meanwhile, at a butchery, Terry and Ed get into an argument. Terry later has a vision—similar to Victor's—in which Ed is skinned alive. That night, he is attacked and brutally flayed. Reyes and Doggett arrive in Novi and talk to Detective Van Allen (James McDonnell), who seems apathetic about the case. At the same time, Scully contacts Dr. Bertram Mueller (George D. Wallace), a former medical examiner who autopsied several bodies in the 1960s that were skinned in a manner similar to Potts. Mueller tells Scully that the sheriff at the time did not pay much attention to the cases, emphasizing that there was more than one victim, and that he later killed himself. Reyes and Doggett receive news of Terry's attack and arrive at the local butchery to find him strung up among the pigs. While looking around the crime scene, Doggett discovers that Terry is still alive; Terry weakly says Ed's name. Doggett and the local police arrest Ed, who claims that he is innocent. Reyes believes him and admits that she too is having similar visions. Ed is freed, but not before having a vision in which Dr. Holland is skinned. In the meantime, Scully discovers that Potts and Terry were both born on the same day that two of the 1960s murder victims died. Doggett, acting on Reyes' insistence that Ed is in danger, stakes out his house. Ed, however, is skinned regardless of Doggett's attempts to protect him. Reyes admits to Doggett that she is having flashes of the same premonitions that the victims are experiencing. She tells Doggett that Ed's body was gagged with a rag coated in coal dust from a mine, even though she has never seen his body. Reyes and Doggett head to the mine from which they believe the dust originated. Doggett finds the skeleton of a sheriff who killed himself in 1909. Reyes finds newspaper clippings explaining the story: In 1868, a group of four miners murdered a man. The murderers' souls have been reincarnated several times since, only to be brutally skinned by the soul of the victim. In each case, the avenger is a prominent figure of the law. Reyes soon stumbles onto the collected skin of the victims, but is attacked by Van Allen. Doggett eventually finds her unharmed. Reyes explains to Doggett that Van Allen is avenging his own murder and that all the murders that are linked to the case have been in groups of four. Reyes believes Van Allen takes his own life each time in order to restart the series of murders. Reyes frantically calls Holland, informing her that she is the fourth victim. Van Allen arrives at the church, but is stopped by Reyes. Later, Reyes muses to Scully that in the past, she had always failed to stop Van Allen's spirit. In this life, however, she managed to succeed. The shot changes to Van Allen dying, only to be reincarnated into a newborn baby. Production right \\"Hellbound\\" was written by supervising producer David Amann and directed by Kim Manners. The episode was Amann's sixth episode written for the series, after season six's \\"Terms of Endearment\\" and \\"Agua Mala\\", season seven's \\"Rush\\" and \\"Chimera\\", and season eight's \\"Invocation\\".Hurwitz and Knowles, pp. 236–240 With this episode, executive producer Frank Spotnitz was interested in taking Annabeth Gish's character into a darker area. Executive producer John Shiban later explained that the episode—which deals with themes of \\"reincarnation and the idea of karmic justice\\"—revolved around Reyes questioning whether she was \\"a good person or a bad person? Did she fight evil, or did she let evil happen.\\" It has been noted that the episode's plot is similar to mythology surrounding the Aztec agriculture god Xipe Totec. In mythology, Xipe Totec is often represented wearing flayed human skin, usually with the skin of the hands falling loosely from the wrists.Fernández, p. 60Moctezuma and Olguín, p. 422. The production crew was tasked with building a refrigerated building the size of a warehouse for the slaughterhouse scenes. The crew rented an old dairy and decorated it with 300 slaughter pigs, supplemented by 200 additional rubber pigs. The skinned human bodies in the episode were created by spraying a mannequin with a layer of latex. The layer was then peeled off. Makeup technicians then took the \\"peeled skin\\" and positioned it onto other mannequins that had been designed to resemble the actors. According to Hurwitz and Knowles in the book The Complete X-Files, the effects were \\"a level of detail and sophistication never before seen on series television.\\" The makeup staff worked quickly; according to Robert Patrick, the team \\"literally did a 36-hour day to pull off some of\\" the effects.Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 202 The faux skin was created to look \\"moist\\" and was composed of over 200 prosthetic pieces. Fake veins were then overlaid on top of the skin. Makeup department head Cheri Montesanto-Medcalf later claimed that \\"seven makeup artists work[ed] seven hours on each person [for] ten days. ReceptionRatings= \\"Hellbound\\" originally aired in the United States on the Fox network on January 27, 2002, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One on January 5, 2003. The episode's initial broadcast was viewed by approximately 5.4 million households, and 7.7 million viewers,Kessenich, p. 193 making it the seventy-first most watched episode of television that aired during the week ending January 27. \\"Hellbound\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 5.1, meaning that it was seen by 5.1% of the nation's estimated households. =Reviews= \\"Hellbound\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a \\"B\\". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote positively of the entry's plot—comparing it to the first season episode \\"Squeeze\\" and the fourth season episode \\"The Field Where I Died\\"—calling the writing \\"delightfully subtle\\". They praised Amann's misdirection, noting that the episode contains several red herrings. Shearman and Pearson also praised the episode's effects, calling the skinless bodies \\"the high point of the series' trading in gore\\".Shearman and Pearson, pp. 266–267 M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, called the episode \\"unexpectedly entertaining\\" and praised the script's attempts to shed more light on Reyes' character.
