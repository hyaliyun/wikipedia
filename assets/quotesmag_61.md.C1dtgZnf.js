The origins of the Danmark lie in efforts of the Confederate States of America to purchase warships in Europe, which is to say in the United Kingdom and France, during the American Civil War. These efforts were led by James Dunwoody Bulloch, but the Danmark was ordered by another Confederate agent, Lieutenant (later Commander) James H. North. North was sent to Europe by Confederate Navy secretary Stephen Mallory with the aim of buying a completed sea-going ironclad warship, the French Navy's Gloire, and ordering a similar vessel on Confederate account. The French government refused to sell Gloire, or to allow a sister ship to be built in French shipyards. North proceeded to Britain, where the Whig government had adopted a laissez-faire attitude to American arms-buying. Here he met with George Thomson, co-owner of the Clydebank shipbuilders J. & G. Thompson. North signed a contract with Thomson's on 21 May 1862 for an armoured frigate of some 3,000 tons and 80 metres in length, for a contract price of 190,000 pounds sterling--around two million Confederate dollars at the prevailing rate of exchange--paying a deposit of 18,000 pounds. Thomson's contracted to the deliver the ship by 1 June 1863. Known to the Confederates as \\"North's ship\\", or as \\"Number 61\\", she was Santa Maria to her builders. As finally completed, she displaced 4,750 tons, a slab-sided three-masted barque. Under steam, she would make . By the summer of 1863, the Confederate agents in Europe were seeking to sell off North's ship, offering her to the Imperial Russian Navy. The ship was clearly unsuited to Confederate needs, being too large and requiring too large a crew for their limited resources, and her draft of 6 metres was too deep for operations in the shoal waters on the Confederate coasts. Thompson's too were concerned that they would not be allowed to deliver the ship to the Confederates in the changed political climate and cancelled the contract in late 1863. Work continued slowly on the ship, which was launched on 23 February 1864. The outbreak of the Second War of Schleswig led the Royal Danish Navy to purchase the ship, but delays in fitting out and working up meant that she was not ready for service before the end of the war. The Danmark undertook only one active commission, from June to October 1869. At sea with her armament aboard she rolled violently, and the coal consumption of her engines was extremely high. As a result, she remained in reserve thereafter, becoming a barracks ship in 1893 before being eventually scrapped in 1907. As commissioned into Danish service, she was armed with 20 60-pounder (8-inch) smoothbore muzzle-loading guns of 88 hundredweight and 8 18-pounder rifled muzzle-loading guns of 40 hundredweight. In 1865 this was changed to an all-rifled muzzle-loading armament of 12 60-pounder guns and 10 24-pounder guns. Two more 24-pounder guns were added in 1867.

It was one of the last tramways in regular use to use wooden rails covered in iron sheaths. History The tramway was constructed around 1870, following the opening of the Llangollen and Corwen Railway which passed through Glyndyfrdwy. The tramway initially ran from the Deeside Slate Works at Nant-y-Pandy to the Deeside quarry. The tramway was unusual in its use of wooden rails with iron sheaths on the running surfaces, a very early form of permanent way, and one that had almost entirely died out by this date. In the late 1870s the tramway was extended in two directions to bring its total length to . The line was extended north from the Deeside slate works along the east side of Nant-y- Pandy to the head of a long incline that dropped through Glyndyfrdwy to a transhipment wharf with the Llangollen and Corwen Railway. The line was extended south and west from Deeside Quarry, running up the west side of the quarry by a further incline, then looping westwards along the hillside to the foot of the exit incline of the Moel Fferna quarry. These extensions were laid with traditional iron rails, although the original section retained the wooden rails throughout its lifetime. The line continued operating until just after the end of the Second World War, finally closing in 1947. Operation Throughout its life the tramway was operated by gravity workings from the quarries to Glyndyfrdwy, with return trains hauled by horses. The remains of the tramway= Glyndyfrdwy = The remains of the incline running through the village The remains of the trans-shipment wharf are on the east of the crossing keeper's box on the Llangollen Railway and are now part of a children's play area. The inclined plane runs approximately south up the hill. One modern house is built across the incline on the north side of the A5 road. Another house has been built across the formation on the south side of the A5, and the tunnel under the road was filled-in during the early 1960s = Glyndyfrdwy to Nant-y-Pandy = At the top of the incline the walls of the winding house still stand. From here a footpath follows the trackbed of the tramway. There are occasional sleepers and lengths of flat-bottomed rail along this section. There are several building remains at the Deeside Slate Works and explanatory signboards have been installed there. Running south is the shallow incline towards Deeside Slab Quarry. There are longitudinal wooden rails still in situ in many places, especially in the damp cuttings. Occasionally, a line of rusty metal marks where one of the tie bars that held the rails to gauge sat. In at least one location, a metal rail sheath is still visible over the wood of a rail. = Nant-y-Pandy to Deeside Slab Quarry = Above Nant-y-Pandy the route passes the site of the reservoir that provided water power to the mill's overshot waterwheel, before the formation is breached by the valley road. Above Ty'n y Wern the tramway formation reappears on the hillside above the road, past Tan-y-Graig, until the road climbs up and takes over the tramway route. From here until the Deeside quarry, the tramway formation is now a farm road. The formation crosses the head of the valley in a horseshoe curve and rounds the bluff to reach the quarry. At the south-west edge of the quarry an incline leads up to the route to Moel Fferna quarry.

The show follows the life of Josep Lopes and David G√ºell. The show was co-produced by Kr√†mpack, El Terrat and Televisi√≥ de Catalunya and directed by Oriol Grau, Llu√≠s Manyoses and Joel Joan. The series, which ran for 73 episodes of between 25 and 30 minutes over six seasons, was broadcast between April 19, 1999 and April 15, 2002. Plats Bruts enjoyed very good ratings from the beginning, reaching up to a million viewers in the second episode broadcast, and achieved an average of over 35% share and 900,000 viewers in Catalonia. Afterwards the series was broadcast on Canal 300 and 3XL and dubbed into Spanish so it could be aired on V√≠a Digital, a digital platform which a predecessor of Movistar Plus and ETB 2, a channel broadcasting in the Basque Country. The series generally contained self-contained stories, with no continuous plot. During its emission it received very good reviews thanks to its fresh and amusing script and due to the cast of actors, several of whom went on to enjoy fame at a national level, including Jordi S√°nchez. The show regularly makes fun of Catalan society, especially in its references to Catalanism. Synopsis L√≥pes and David are two men who share a flat in the Eixample district of Barcelona. The relationship between the two exists because Lopes was David's Boy Scout leader when he was young but, in terms of their personality, they are not at all alike. In the first episode, when they both visit an apartment which is up for rent, they decide to share. Lopes is a failure: a 34-year-old bachelor who has to share a flat because he has on a \\"junk contract\\" at R√†dio Bofarull, where he works as an announcer. David is a somewhat spoiled young man who one day decides to break with his life and move out of his parents' house, although he still receives a weekly allowance and takes his house assistant, Carbonell, with him. He is convinced that he has the talent to be an actor and studies at the Institut del Teatre in Barcelona. The two men are accompanied by Emma, a girl who lives in a wooden shack located on the roof of the building but uses the men's flat's water, light and heating. Other recurring characters include Pol, a homosexual acting student and classmate of David who works as a waiter in the Caf√© Maurici; Ramon, Lopes's colleague on the radio; and Mercedes, the director of R√†dio Bofarull. Episodes Like many sitcoms, the show's episode titles followed a naming convention: all but four started with the word \\"tinc\\" meaning \\"I have\\", and the exceptions to the rule varied only slightly, beginning with words like \\"Tenim\\" (we have), \\"No tinc\\" (I don't have) or \\"Ho tinc\\" (\\"I have it\\"). The show's greatest controversy was an episode titled \\"Tinc una revelaci√≥\\" (\\"I have a revelation\\"), which was censured for some time. In the episode, David develops a Messiah complex after watching The Passion of the Christ, before finally giving way to temptation in the form of Lopes' visiting female friend. It was not broadcast during the show's reruns or via online platforms. Finally in 2018, after receiving questions from Catalan newspaper Ara, TV3 made the episode available to watch online. The show's final episode was \\"Tinc Touchdown\\" (\\"I have a touchdown\\") and featured the Barcelona Dragons American football team.

Eleanor Cross ‚Äì Lincoln The St Catherine's, Lincoln, cross at Lincoln Castle Queen Eleanor was taken ill on a journey to meet Edward and was diagnosed as having \\"slow fever\\", she was taken to Richard de Westons manor house at Harby near Lincoln and it was there she died in November 1290. Edward was grief-stricken at his wife's death and shut himself away for several days, possibly planning memorials to his beloved Queen Eleanor. The Queen's body was first taken to Lincoln for embalming at St Catherine's Priory. The viscera was buried in a tomb at Lincoln Cathedral and her heart was buried at Blackfriars Church in London. Her body was taken to Westminster Abbey for burial in a tomb. King Edward later declared that to honour Eleanor, a memorial would be erected wherever the Queen's body had rested on its journey home to Westminster. Crosses of this nature were erected in the hope that pilgrims and those passing by would pray for the soul of the Queen. The first of the Eleanor crosses was erected on Swine's Green, opposite the gates of St Catherine's. Of the 12 crosses erected only three now remain standing. In the grounds of Lincoln Castle there is a small piece of the St Catherine's cross, that was originally in the Priory grounds. The only remaining piece of the Eleanor cross that survives is preserved in Lincoln Castle. The Priory Centre is planning to have a replica of the Queen Eleanor cross erected at the front of the Priory.

Prior to recording, Brooks and her sound engineer and husband Trevor Jordan realised that despite the previous success, money to record the new album was not forthcoming. After learning that profits from No More the Fool had been hidden away in an overseas account, this new album was to be recorded on a fraction of the budget and the record company had lost enthusiasm for the project.Finding My Voice, Elkie Brooks autobiography. The Robson Press, 2012, pg 177-79 Carrying on regardless, a list of tracks was agreed upon including covers of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" and Juice Newton's US hit, \\"Can't Wait All Night\\". Brooks herself wrote three of the tracks; \\"Sail On\\", \\"Keep It a Secret\\" and \\"Kiss Me for the Last Time\\", the former written with Trevor Jordan. Another track, \\"What's the Matter Baby\\", was a cover of the Timi Yuro hit. Yuro was given a copy of the album and personally telephoned Brooks to congratulate her, saying that it was the best version of the song she'd ever heard.

She was a wanted fugitive apprehended on March 31, 2007 by the FBI after being on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list for less than 24 hours. A reward of $100,000 for information leading to her arrest was offered. Biography Henderson grew up in the Charlie Parker Square public housing project in Kansas City, Missouri. Criminal history Police have suspected Henderson was involved in as many as five other murders and a number of other shootings. However, no other charges have been filed. =Manslaughter= On September 2, 2006, Henderson shot and killed DeAndre Parker at a gas station in Kansas City, Missouri. Henderson claimed Parker was trying to run her over with his truck. A jury acquitted Henderson of murder charges but found her guilty of the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter and armed criminal action. The Kansas City Police Department claimed that Henderson was a leader of the violent 12 Street gang who associated with gangs from 24th street through 27th, 51st, and 57th Street. Their alliance was titled \\"512\\", \\"5 ace 2\\", or \\"5 ace deuce\\". However, the claims of the police were never substantiated. At trial, Henderson denied any involvement with gangs. In May 2012, Henderson was sentenced to serve 10 years in prison for the 2006 manslaughter conviction for which she had previously been sentenced to probation. This sentence of 10 years will run consecutively to her seven-year federal sentence for the charge of being a felon in possession of a weapon so she will spend a total of 17 years in prison. =Felon in possession of a firearm= On October 27, 2011, Henderson pleaded guilty to felonious possession of a firearm.

He is primarily known for his popular fiction on historical themes.  Life and career  Gomi was born in the Namba neighborhood of Osaka. His parents died when he was still a small child, and he was raised by his grandparents, who had a thriving business running local theaters and cinemas. He dropped out of a preparatory school for Waseda University, but when faced with danger of conscription in 1942, quickly enrolled into the Literature Department of Meiji University. However, in 1943, all university students were conscripted into the Imperial Japanese Army and Gomi was sent to the China front, and was based at Nanjing until the end of the war. During World War II, he met author Yasuda Yojuro, who encouraged him to pursue his interest in history and historical fiction with a career as a writer. After the end of the war, Gomi completed his education at Meiji University, and began writing popular fiction with swordsmen of the Edo period as his protagonists. In particular, he wrote many stories using the historical Yagy≈´ J≈´bei Mitsuyoshi as his hero. He also created a character named Aoi Shingo, a fictional illegitimate son of sh≈çgun Tokugawa Yoshimune, who travels around Japan in disguise, righting wrongs done by the government. Gomi lived in Mitaka, Tokyo from 1947, where famed sumo wrestler Minanogawa T≈çz≈ç was a neighbor. He moved to Kobe in 1950, where he was subsequently hospitalized for an overdose of illegal stimulants. He returned to Tokyo in 1952. Gomi won the 28th Akutagawa Prize in 1953. His novel, The Secret Scrolls, was made into a movie Yagyu Secret Scrolls starring Toshir≈ç Mifune in 1958. In addition to his career as a writer, Gomi was also a noted music critic of classical music, and also a reviewer and critic of audio systems. He was a man of wide-ranging hobbies, from mahjong to palmistry, and he left numerous monographs of his hobbies as well. A car buff, Gomi was arrested for drunken driving in May 1961. On January 31, 1964 he was involved in a head-on collision with a truck while driving on Japan National Route 1 at Suzuka, Mie, which left him hospitalized with internal injuries. On July 24, 1965, while speeding through Nagoya, he ran over and killed a 60-year-old woman and her 6-year-old grandchild. He was given a light sentence (18 months in prison, five years probation) partly due to a petition signed by numerous literary luminaries including Kawabata Yasunari, Shiga Naoya, Mishima Yukio and others. Gomi died of lung cancer in 1980 at the age of 58. His grave is at the temple of Kench≈ç- ji in Kamakura, Kanagawa.

It also provided conference and market research services to a wide variety of industries. Chilton grew from a small publisher of a single magazine to a leading publisher of business-to-business magazines, consumer and professional automotive manuals, craft and hobby books, and a large, well-known marketing research company. In the early years, its flagship magazine was Iron Age. In 1955, Chilton's profit reached $1 million for the first time, of which Iron Age accounted for $750,000. By 1980, Iron Age's revenue and status had declined due to the reduction in the size of the US metalworking manufacturing industry, and Jewelers Circular Keystone captured the position of Chilton's most profitable magazine. While Chilton had leading magazines in several different industries, the Chilton name is most strongly associated with the consumer and professional automotive manuals, which Cengage continues to license or publish.  History  The company's origins go back to July 1896, and the first issue of Cycle Trade Journal, edited by James Artman who became the first president of the future Chilton Company. In 1899, the magazine changed its name to Cycle & Automobile Trade Journal. A 1900 magazine masthead listed Musselman & Buzby as the exclusive advertising representatives for Cycle & Automobile Trade Journal. In 1900, George Buzby, C. A. Musselman, and James Artman merged their companies to form the Trade Advertising & Publishing Co. The new company expanded into automotive catalogs, booklets, circulars, and posters. The company selected the name Chilton from the Mayflowers passenger list. The earliest known use of the corporate name Chilton Company was in 1904. It appears on a corporate seal that reads \\"Chilton Company of Pennsylvania, incorporated March 31, 1904.\\" In 1907, the three partners purchased a printing company that they renamed the Chilton Printing Company, only publicly adopting the name Chilton Company in 1910. In March 1911, Chilton published the first issue of Commercial Car Journal. In February 1912, they renamed the original Cycle & Automobile Trade Journal to Automobile Trade Journal, and eventually merged it into Motor Age magazine. In 1923, the partners sold Chilton to United Publishers Corp of New York for $1,635,000, and Artman and Buzby retired. In the same year, Chilton opened a new printing plant at 56th and Chestnut Streets in Philadelphia. This location became the Chilton Company corporate headquarters in the late 1940s. Shortly after the purchase, United Publishers merged their Class Journal subsidiary and Chilton into what became known as the Chilton Class Journal Co, with C. A. Musselman as its president. This merger brought several future flagship magazines (such as Iron Age, Motor Age, Dry Goods Economist, Jewelers Circular, Hardware Age, and Automotive Industries) into the Chilton stable of magazines. In 1934, the company underwent a complete reorganization. J. Howard Pew provided an infusion of cash that saved the company from bankruptcy, in exchange for a majority of the stock. All subsidiaries merged into one company and incorporated in the state of Delaware as Chilton Company. While the cash infusion from J. Howard Pew saved the company, it became the single biggest inhibitor to its growth, as Pew did not permit Chilton to seek outside funding for acquisitions. As a result, Chilton Company's growth over the next thirty years lagged behind competitors like McGraw Hill and Penton. George Buzby's son G. C. (Carroll) Buzby became president of Chilton in the early 1950s and remained the Chief Executive Officer until he retired in the late 1960s. George C. Buzby died of cancer in 1970. In 1972, Philadelphia native William A. Barbour was elected president of Chilton. In 1979, the American Broadcasting Company purchased the Chilton Company and made it an operating unit of ABC Publishing. ABC already owned Farm Progress, owner of the collectibles publisher Wallace-Homestead. Wallace-Homestead later became a division of Chilton. In 1985, Capital Cities purchased ABC, and in 1996, the Walt Disney Company purchased Capital Cities/ABC. Over-extended financially by its acquisition of Capital Cities ABC, Disney had to sell assets to reduce its debt‚Äîand Chilton, despite its status and recognition as an excellent business- to-business magazine publisher, was not considered a core business. Disney therefore decided to split up and sell the Chilton Company profit centers to multiple buyers: * Krause Publications purchased the Chilton non-automotive book titles * Reed Elsevier purchased the Chilton building and the magazine, trade show, and research division for $444 million in 1997. The research division was sold on to Taylor Nelson AGB in 1998.Cahners sells Chilton Research Services to Taylor Nelson AGB * The Hearst Corporation purchased the Chilton professional automotive assets. In December 1999, a court injunction, effective for three years, divided those assets and rights between Hearst and Nichols Publishing. * Nichols Publishing purchased the Chilton consumer automotive group assets and brand. In 2001, Nichols sold the do-it-yourself automotive print manuals to Haynes Publishing Group (publishers of Haynes Manuals), while retaining licensing rights to the Chilton do-it-yourself brand for print products for 10 years. In 2003, Nichols sold the remaining automotive assets to Thomson Learning. In 2007, Thomson Learning became Cengage Learning. In 2011, Cengage Learning became owner of the Chilton brand for do-it-yourself print manuals as well. Cengage continues to publish or license the professional and consumer automotive products and assets.  Offices  After acquisition by United Publishers in 1923, the corporate office moved to New York City. In 1955, all former United Publishers magazines and their staffs relocated from New York City to the corporate headquarters at 56th and Chestnut Streets in Philadelphia. In 1968, Chilton moved their corporate offices to Decker Square in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. This served as temporary headquarters until 1972 when Chilton moved into its new corporate headquarters building in Radnor, Pennsylvania.  Automobile repair manuals  Chilton currently publishes hundreds of automobile repair manuals that cover thousands of models. Here are some of the manufacturers covered in the Chilton do-it-yourself library: *Acura *Alfa Romeo *American Motors *Audi *Austin *BMW *Buick *Cadillac *Chevrolet *Chrysler *DeSoto *Dodge *Fiat *Ford *Frazer *Geo *GMC *Honda *Hyundai *Infiniti *International *Jaguar *Jeep *Kaiser *Kia *Lexus *Lincoln *Mazda *Mini *Mitsubishi *Mercedes-Benz *Mercury *MG *Nash *Nissan *Oldsmobile *Opel *Peugeot *Plymouth *Pontiac *Porsche *Renault *Saab *Saturn *Scion *Studebaker *Subaru *Toyota *Triumph *Volkswagen *Volvo *Mitsubishi  Fiction publishing  After many years of publishing business- to-business magazines and automotive manuals, Chilton acquired the trade publisher Greenberg: Publisher in 1958. Chilton published the celebrated science fiction novels Dune by Frank Herbert (1965), and The Witches of Karres (1966) by James H. Schmitz. Each was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Novel in its respective year, and Dune won the award.

In the 2007 season, he posted a career- high 38 tackles and led the team with 6 caused fumbles. Winters grew up in the tough Herman Gardens project of Detroit, Michigan. When he was in middle school, gang violence began permeating the projects. For many, adolescence is one's search for acceptance. Like his head coach and many of his teammates, Winters sought acceptance in organized sports such as baseball and football rather than joining violent street gangs. Although he escaped the vicious cycle of violence himself, his 19-year-old brother Malik was murdered in a drive-by shooting in 1998. Winters hails from Detroit's St. Martin de Porres High School (closed 2005) where he won the MHSAA State Class C Football Title twice. While at St. Martin de Porres, Winters was an All-American in two sports football and baseball.

At the end of his college career he was drafted once again in the twentieth round by the Kansas City Royals. After leaving the game of football for a brief period of time, he spent several years playing in the Arena Football League, with the Detroit Fury and the Las Vegas Gladiators. While playing in the AFL, Winters won the 2002 \\"Hero award\\" awarded to the individual who exemplifies the most commitment to the local community and charity events. Winters spends a great deal of time working with various organizations and is a great motivational speaker. He has an immeasurable impact on young people, and draws on his personal trials and struggles to illustrate his points. Winters is committed to working in the Greater Toronto Area to ensure that its streets remain safe for all and that youth have a variety of life options from which to choose. He has been an active part of the Toronto Argonauts Stop the Violence campaign, and has often spoken to students at different schools across Toronto. As of 2008, Winters has become a board member for the Stop the Violence initiative and continues to do countless community appearances in the GTA area and in the United States. During his career with the Argonauts, Winters made more than 900 appearances in the community. He was nominated three times for the Canadian Football League Players' Association Tom Pate Memorial Award, given annually to the CFL player who displays outstanding charitable efforts and superior community involvement and leadership.

The phrase was first adopted in Canada in the Supreme Court of Canada decision of Libman v. The Queen (1985). It is used in several circumstances in matters of conflict of laws. Enforcement of foreign judgments The test is primarily used to determine whether a Canadian court will recognize a foreign judgment where there was service ex juris. Courts will usually recognize a judgment from a foreign province or nation where the claimant shows that there is a real and substantial connection between the subject matter of the litigation or the damages suffered and the jurisdiction issuing the judgment. The foreign judgment must be final and the foreign court no longer has any power to change or rescind it. Jurisdiction When a claimant wishes to bring an action to a Canadian court, the Court must be satisfied that it has jurisdiction over the matter. Jurisdiction in personam is determined using the real and substantial connection test. In SOCAN v. CAIP (2004), the Supreme Court of Canada applied the R&S; connection test to determine the location of a breach of copyright in the context of peer to peer downloading.

From 2006 to 2007, he made ten appearances for the Israeli national team, scoring twice. Early life Born in Warri, Nigeria, his parents came to Israel in 1990, where his father, footballer Clement Temile, played professionally for Beitar Netanya. When the team ran into financial dire straits and was forced to stop paying salaries, his parents reverted to working various odd jobs. His parents left Israel in 1991 to try to find gainful employment in Nigeria or elsewhere, leaving Toto temporarily with a teammate of his father. When it became obvious that his parents were not coming back for him, Toto was adopted (unofficially) by Israeli citizen Orit Tamuz who cared for him and raised him as her own child, which is where his Hebrew surname derives from.

She was built in Bordeaux, France in 1864 for the Confederate States Navy. Prussia bought her during the Second Schleswig War against Denmark, but she was not delivered until after the war. She was designed as an armored ram but also carried three guns: one and two pieces in armored turrets. She was named after Prince Adalbert of Prussia, an early proponent of Prussian naval power. The ship was poorly built and as a result had a very limited service career. She was heavily modified after her delivery to Prussia in 1865 and briefly served with the fleet between 1866 and 1871. During the Franco- Prussian War in 1870‚Äì1871, the ship was assigned as a guard ship in Hamburg. After the war, it was discovered that the internal wood construction was badly rotted; she was therefore removed from service in October 1871. Prinz Adalbert was stricken from the naval register in May 1878 and broken up for scrap that year. Design=General characteristics and propulsion= Prinz Adalbert was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. She was designed to displace at a normal load and up to at combat load. The ship's hull was constructed from transverse frames, and included both iron and timber. The hull was sheathed in copper to protect it from parasites and biofouling and it featured a pronounced tumblehome. The Prussians regarded the ship as a poor seaboat. The ram bow caused the vessel to ship a great deal of water. It was, however, responsive to commands from the helm and had a very tight turning radius. Prinz Adalbert had a crew of ten officers and 120 enlisted men. Prinz Adalberts propulsion system was provided by Mazeline, based in Le Havre. The ship was powered by a pair of 2-cylinder single-expansion steam engines, each of which drove a four-bladed screw that was in diameter. The engines were placed in a single engine room. Two trunk boilers, also in a single boiler room, supplied steam to the engines at . Her propulsion system was rated to produce for a top speed of . Two rudders were fitted side by side to control the vessel and ensure good maneuverability, owing to the fact that the ram was its primary offensive weapon. The ship was initially fitted with a brig sailing rig to supplement the steam engines, though this was subsequently replaced with a topsail schooner rig. = Armament and armor = As built, Prinz Adalbert was armed with three rifled 36-pounder muzzle-loading guns. One was placed in an fixed five-port bow battery, while the other two were located in a fixed two-port turret amidships. The guns were on movable pivot mounts to allow them to fire through the different firing ports. After delivery in 1865, the French guns were replaced with Krupp-built guns: a L/19 gun was placed in the bow and two L/25 guns in the central battery. The forward gun was supplied with 76 rounds of ammunition while the central guns had 71 shells each. Prinz Adalbert was armored with wrought iron, which was mounted on the wooden hull. The armored belt, which protected the waterline of the ship, was thick. The turrets were protected by of armor plating on the sides.  Service history  Prinz Adalbert (right) and (left) Prinz Adalbert was built under the cover name Cheops along with a sister ship named Sphinx by the French shipyard of the Arman Brothers in Bordeaux. Nominally being built for the Egyptian Navy, they were actually intended for sale to the Confederate States of America. The French emperor, Napoleon III, intervened and ordered the Arman brothers to sell both vessels to another navy immediately. In early 1864 during the Second Schleswig War between the Prussian and Austrian alliance and Denmark, both the Prussian and Danish fleets sought vessels that could be purchased abroad. On 31 March, Denmark secured the contract for Sphinx but Cheops was sold to Prussia on 25 May. Delivery was delayed due to the war and the Prussians cancelled the order briefly before reinstating it in January 1865. The vessel was finally delivered in October and she was commissioned on the 29th of the month as Prinz Adalbert. Along with the turret ship , Prinz Adalbert was among the first armored vessels acquired by the Prussian Navy. The ship was named for Prince Adalbert of Prussia, one of the creators of the fleet. She was found to be in poor condition on entering service with the fleet, and while conducting trials off Denmark in June 1865, the ship ran aground. During the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, Prinz Adalbert was mobilized in Kiel under the command of Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Eduard von Jachmann, but due to the lack of opponents in the North and Baltic Seas, the ship remained in the Baltic for the duration of the war. The ship did not last long in service due to her poor construction, defects with her armor plate, she was unable to use her sailing rig, and her hull leaked badly; much of the fault lay with the use of low- quality wood in the construction of her hull. These problems necessitated significant refurbishment, which was carried out at the naval depot at Geestem√ºnde in 1868‚Äì1869. Her armor plating had to be removed and reinstalled, a breakwater was installed at the stern of the ship, and the main mast had to be relocated. She was re-rigged to a schooner rig during this refit. Despite the repairs, Prinz Adalbert continued to suffer from severe leaking throughout her short career and she remained a poor sailing vessel. In May 1870, Prinz Adalbert joined the three armored frigates , , and for a visit to Britain, though Friedrich Carl was damaged after running aground in the Great Belt. Prinz Adalbert, K√∂nig Wilhelm, and Kronprinz continued on to Plymouth while Friedrich Carl returned to Kiel for repairs. The latter vessel quickly rejoined the ships there and on 1 July they departed for a training cruise to Fayal in the Azores, Portugal. But as tensions with France over the Hohenzollern candidacy for the vacant Spanish throne. While they cruised east through the English Channel, they learned of the increasing likelihood of war, and the Prussians detached Prinz Adalbert to Dartmouth to be kept informed of events. The rest of the squadron joined her there on 13 July, and as war seemed to be imminent, the Prussians ended the cruise and returned to home. Kronprinz had to take Prinz Adalbert under tow for the voyage due to the latter's slow speed. The ships arrived back in Wilhelmshaven on 16 July, three days before France declared war on Prussia over the Ems Dispatch, initiating the Franco-Prussian War. The greatly numerically inferior Prussian Navy assumed a defensive posture against a naval blockade imposed by the French Navy. For the duration of the conflict, Prinz Adalbert served as a harbor guard ship in Hamburg. Her timber hull was found to be rotten in 1871, which forced her decommissioning. She was removed from service on 23 October 1871 and disarmed in 1875‚Äì1876. The ship was formally stricken from the naval register on 28 May 1878. She was broken up that year in Wilhelmshaven, and her engines were removed and reused.

He is credited with the development of scientific-technical terminology in Chinese. Early life field mill in the Chinese book Yuanxi Qiqi Tushuo Luzui (Collected Diagrams and Explanations of the Wonderful Machines of the Far West), compiled and translated by Johann Schreck and his Chinese colleague Wang Zheng in 1627 Schreck studied medicine starting in 1590 at the Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg, the University of Altdorf. After graduating, he is also known to have worked as an assistant to the mathematician Fran√ßois Vi√®te in Paris in around 1600. After Vi√®te's death in 1603 he moved to the University of Padua, where he was a student of Galileo Galilei, but studied medicine.E Schreck had an exceptional facility with languages; he spoke German, Italian, Portuguese, French and English. Like most educated men of his time, he wrote his letters in Latin. He also mastered Ancient Greek, Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic. Later in his life, he learned Chinese. Sojourn in Rome He became a highly respected medic and was affiliated to the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome, which he joined on 3 May 1611, a few days after Galileo Galilei. Together with two other German-speaking members of the Accademia, Giovanni Faber and Theophilus M√ºller, he worked on the encyclopaedia of botany Rerum medicarum Novae Hispaniae Thesaurus which had been begun decades before by Francisco Hern√°ndez de Toledo and purchased, incomplete, by Federico Cesi. This work did not occupy him for long however, as he decided to join the Jesuit order, taking his vows on 1 November 1611. Galileo described his decision as \\"Una gran perdita\\" ‚Äì \\"a big loss\\". Passage to China The founder of the Jesuit mission in China, Matteo Ricci, had sent his colleague Nicolas Trigault back to Europe to search out new missionaries who could share the most advanced scientific ideas with the Chinese.Toby E. Huff, Intellectual Curiosity and the Scientific Revolution: A Global Perspective, CUP 2010 pp.78-9 Trigault met Schreck in Rome in 1614, while Schreck was studying theology, and persuaded him to go to China. To raise money and equipment for their mission, they travelled around Europe in 1616, soliciting donations and collecting books, mechanical equipment and scientific instruments.Stephanie Schrader, Looking East: Rubens's Encounter with Asia, Getty Publications, 2013 p.50 One of their donors was Cardinal Federico Borromeo of Milan, who gave them what was to be the first western telescope in China. In April 1618, Schreck sailed from Lisbon with a group of Jesuits Trigault had assembled, including Giacomo Rho and Johann Adam Schall von Bell.Agust√≠n Ud√≠as, Jesuit Contribution to Science: A History, Springer, 27 Sep 2014 p.86 After several pirate attacks and outbreaks of disease Schreck arrived at Goa in October 1618.Chris Lowney, Heroic Leadership: Best Practices from a 450-Year-Old Company That Changed the World, Loyola Press, 2010 p.256 He continued on his way, collecting samples of flora and fauna wherever he stopped en route; Giulio Aleni later claimed that alone he had discovered more than five hundred new plants. His plan was to produce a compendium with the title Plinius Indicus (The Indian Pliny), similar to Hernandez's volume on Mexico. He worked on this project throughout his stay in China, and expanded it to include descriptions of more than 8,000 varieties of plant,Reinhard Wendt, Sammeln, Vernetzen, Auswerten: Missionare und ihr Beitrag zum Wandel europ√§ischer Weltsicht, Gunter Narr Verlag, 2001 p.32 but his early death meant it was never finished. His manuscripts were preserved, perhaps into the eighteenth century, in the collections of the Portuguese College in Beijing, but are now lost.Stefan Tilg & Sarah Knight, The Oxford Handbook of Neo-Latin, Oxford University Press, 2015 p.564 Early work in China Schreck reached Macau on 22 July 1619 during a period towards the end of the reign of the Ming Emperor Wanli, when Jesuits had been expelled from Beijing and Nanjing.Tito M. Toniette, And Yet It Is Heard: Musical, Multilingual and Multicultural History of the Mathematical Sciences, Springer, 2014 vol. 2 p.212 He therefore spent nearly two years in Macau learning Chinese before continuing to Hangzhou in June 1621. There, probably in collaboration with a Christian convert named Li Zhizao, he wrote Taixi renshen shuogai (An Outline of Western Theories of the Human Body), based on Theatrum anatomicum by Caspar Bauhin. This work described the human body, the senses and language, including an outline of Matteo Ricci's famous memory palace. The book was edited by another convert, Bi Gongchen, and published after Schreck's death.Martha Cheung, An Anthology of Chinese Discourse on Translation (Volume 2): From the Late Twelfth Century to 1800, Taylor & Francis, 13 Sep 2016 p.104 After reaching Beijing in late 1623 Schreck began collaborating closely with a judge and military inspector from Shaanxi named Wang Zheng. In 1627 the two of them published Yuanxi Qiqi Tushuo Luzui (), (Diagrams and explanations of the wonderful machines of the Far West). Astronomy Matteo Ricci had asked Trigault to bring back missionaries with a knowledge of astronomy and, as Schreck was the ablest of the new recruits, much of the work translating and explaining astronomical works fell to him. For help in this task, Schreck wrote for advice to Johannes Kepler who replied in 1627, explaining how predictions could be improved by using an elliptical model for the moon's orbit,John Dvorak, Mask of the Sun: The Science, History and Forgotten Lore of Eclipses, Pegasus Books, 7 Mar 2017 and enclosing a copy of his new Rudolphine Tables. In advance of the solar eclipse of 21 June 1629 over Beijing, Schreck and Nicol√≤ Longobardo competed with Chinese astronomers to predict the timing with the greatest accuracy. The Jesuits' calculations were more accurate, and on this basis the Emperor Chongzhen asked them to undertake a revision of the Chinese calendar.Agust√≠n Ud√≠as, Jesuit Contribution to Science: A History, Springer, 27 Sep 2014 p.87 Schreck also produced plans for building astronomical instruments, which were approved by the Emperor. However he died shortly afterwards, and the project was completed by Johann Adam Schall von Bell and Giacomo Rho. Schall also published a manuscript by Schreck containing much of his knowledge of astronomy and related mathematics, called Ce tian yue shuo () (Brief Description of the Measurement of the Heavens). This describes the basics of astronomy, the movements of heavenly bodies, the working of the telescope, and sunspots, although the existence of these had been known in China for some time. Schall likewise revised and published two works by Schreck on trigonometry, Da ce () (The Great Measurement) and Ge-yuan ba-xian biao () (A Table of Eight Lines), the latter together with Rho. Death Schreck is said to have died as a result of a medical experiment on himself. He is buried in the Zhalan cemetery in Beijing.

Development  The original hamlet, or village, of Linthorpe, ran along either side of what now is known as Burlam Road (previously known as Acklam Road) next to Linthorpe Cemetery. In the late 19th century and early 20th century developers bought up much of the surrounding farmland and began to create a suburb of wide tree-lined avenues on which they built individual villas and terraced properties of some decoration and size. This was during a period of expansion for Middlesbrough. A tram service then connected this new desirable area of 'Linthorpe' to the centre of Middlesbrough,Evening Gazette Remember When ‚Äì Tales of a Teesside Tramline where the new residents usually held managerial, or directorship positions. At the bottom of Burlam Road (Acklam Road end) there are two original cottages still standing today 2011.  Properties  A grammar school for girls was built with the benefaction of Alderman Kirby and the Carter Bequest Hospital was erected by a bequest from Alderman Carter. The Broomlands, was a home set up for socially deprived children and orphans. The Linthorpe Hotel public house, formerly a doctors surgery and residence, was opened in 1957 and stands within its own original expansive grounds. These grounds once contained a carriage turning circle, vegetable garden, orchard and lawns. The grounds still possess several mature trees around the perimeter. On Roman Road, Linthorpe is The Northern School of Art. There is a fairly new community centre situated in Linthorpe which holds popular classes and events on a regular basis, distributing newsletters to the local community. One of the more recent buildings in the area is the Carter Bequest Hospital. It was originally intended for the benefit of less fortunate people. It has since been used as a private hospital and is now a local hospice.  History  Deriving from 'Leofa's village', the present name of Linthorpe has also been recorded as Levynthrop, Levingthorp and Linthrop. The original site was near the junction of the present Acklam Road and Burlam Road. The present Linthorpe Cemetery was then the village green. 'Levingthorp' also included the hamlets of Ayresome and Newport. Linthorpe was once known as Linthorpe Lane, being a main route from the original settlement of Middlesbrough. Roman Road was probably an original Roman route as can be seen on the map of Roman Cleveland. The Blue Hall was a building situated on the corner of Roman Road and Burlam Road. It was reputedly used by smugglers from Newport. Inevitably a rumour exists that there was a subterranean passage from here to the manor house at Acklam; there is, however, no evidence to sustain this. The Blue Hall, demolished in 1870, could have been in existence as far back as 1618. Some of the white cottages of Old Linthorpe survived in St Barnabas Road until they were demolished in 1935. The Victorians were responsible for building the present Linthorpe village which they referred to as New Linthorpe. Albert Park was opened in 1868 by Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. It was created in the rural area of Linthorpe and presented by Henry Bolckow, one of Middlesbrough's ironmasters, at a personal cost of ¬£3,000. In 1872 West Lane Hospital was erected on land taken from Linthorpe Cemetery. It was to be a fever hospital. Also in 1872 the first church services to be held in Linthorpe were in Olive's Gym adjoining the Park Hotel. The following year they were held in the Linthorpe cemetery church. The foundation stones for the first 'proper' church were laid in September 1891. It was in 1897 that this Linthorpe parish church of St Barnabas was opened 'free of debt'. Linthorpe Schools were originally opened as the Wesley Day School on 9 January 1871. On that first day the log: book reads '14 scholars were admitted'. The first week's fees amounted to three shillings. The number of children gradually increased over the following months. Although absences were common the reasons were investigated and usually logged as being 'satisfactory'. Today the schools are housed in two separate buildings ‚Äì infant and junior ‚Äì on the site in Roman Road. The local Middlesbrough Football Club was formed on 18 February 1876 in the Talbot Hotel. The first recorded game was a draw against Teesside Wanderers in 1877. The matches were then played on the Archery Ground in Albert Park. In 1888 the Football League was formed but the following year the team split into Middlesbrough and Middlesbrough Ironopolis, and introduced professional football. They tried to amalgamate in 1891 but could not agree on a name or a ground Ironopolis became financially unsound and folded in 1893. Middlesbrough kept its amateur status and continued by winning the Northern League. The club moved to Ayresome Park in 1903. Tim Williamson made his debut at Middlesbrough in 1902 and went on to become Boro's first England International player. Today people of the area refer to Linthorpe as 'The Village' although it is mainly the shopping area at the southern end of Linthorpe Road to which they refer. The community of Linthorpe extends between parts of Ayresome, Acklam, Tollesby and Middlesbrough town itself and is covered by 2 Council wards. It is very much alive and varied in its population.  Linthorpe Pottery Works  Jug, 1879-82 The Linthorpe Art Pottery was a born of a collaboration between renowned orientalist and designer Dr. Christopher Dresser and local businessman, John Harrison, who was the proprietor of the Sun Brick Works based in Linthorpe village. It operated between 1879 and 1891. It was noted for the boldness of colour and high glaze, as well as being the first commercial pottery to use gas-fired pottery kilns.A novelty in Art Pottery, 15 November 1879.Bracegirdle, C. Linthorpe: The Forgotten Pottery, Country Life, 29 April 1971. The largest collection of the Linthorpe Art Pottery ware in the world was assembled at the local Dorman Memorial Museum. In 1897 the site of the pottery was proposed as a zoological garden ‚Äì in a manner of Belle Vue Gardens. This promised a dance room, side shows, sensations and novelties, fireworks and a permanent zoological collection with hundreds of strange animals and birds ‚Äì all for sixpence. Some 20,000 people attended the opening but found it to be some sort of hoax. There were hardly any attractions, just a few meagre cages of monkeys and birds on show. It lasted seven days and, apparently, for weeks afterwards the bodies of the animals were seen floating on the Pottery Pond. Belle Vue Road is said to be named after the ill-fated zoo and is the only reminder of this fanciful project. More recently the site of the pottery was used as a laundry facility.

The film was a wide commercial success upon its theatrical release, with 5,243,559 tickets sold, making it the fourth most watched feature film in France in 1981 behind La Ch√®vre, Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Fox and the Hound.Jpbox-office.com The music was composed by Ennio Morricone and the main theme \\"Chi Mai\\" became an instrumental hit.  Plot  French secret agent Josselin Beaumont is sent to kill Colonel Njala, the dictator of Malagawi, a fictional African country. However, before he manages to accomplish his mission, the political situation changes drastically and the French secret service resorts to handing over Beaumont to the Malagawian authorities. After a long, unfair trial, during which Beaumont is injected with drugs, he is sentenced to long-term penal servitude at a \\"re-education camp\\". Following a daring escape with one of the other inmates, he returns to France and informs the French secret service of his presence, promising that he will kill Njala, who is in France for an official visit, thus getting his revenge on the people who betrayed him. The secret service responds by setting other agents on Beaumont's trail. However, he manages to remain one step ahead, humiliating and killing some of his major betrayers, including Rosen, the sadistic chief of the secret police. After Rosen falls in a gunfight, Beaumont takes Rosen's identity card and puts his dogtags on his body, spreading confusion within the secret service and temporarily reducing Njala's guard. Beaumont eventually tricks a secret service agent into shooting the dictator. While government officials confer with higher authorities, he slowly walks towards Njala's helicopter, but is shot dead by government agents, who have received the order to do so.

It also has offices in Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, London, Frankfurt, Munich, Tokyo, Hong Kong, S√£o Paulo, Seoul, Singapore, and Beijing. History Milbank's roots are traced back to 1866, with the inception of the original firm, Anderson, Adams & Young set up in 1866 and then as Murray & Aldrich merged in April 1929, with Webb, Patterson & Hadley to become Murray, Aldrich & Webb. In 1931, the firm merged with Masten & Nichols to become Milbank, Tweed, Hope & Webb. The firm's present name dates from 1962. For decades, the firm's biggest clients were the Rockefeller family and the Chase Manhattan Bank. The firm was responsible for the legal work on the building of Rockefeller Center, and up until 2018, had offices located at One Chase Manhattan Plaza, which was later readdressed 28 Liberty, in 2015. After World War II the firm advised new commercial and industrial developments. Milbank created hedge funds and other investment vehicles for financial clients in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, and capitalized on the growth of international business, finance, and technology transactions in the 1990s. Today, Milbank has offices in financial centers including London, Frankfurt, Munich, Seoul, Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong and Beijing, in addition to domestic offices in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. On February 19, 2019, Milbank changed its name from Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP to Milbank LLP. Name partner=Albert G. Milbank= Albert G. Milbank had been a partner in the firm of Masten & Nichols; when that firm merged with Murray, Aldrich & Webb, he became a senior partner of the newly formed Milbank, Tweed, Hope & Webb. While a partner of the firm, Mr. Milbank was also a member of the board of directors of the Welfare Board of New York City and Greater New York, as well as of the New York War Fund and the National Institute of Social Science. He was a trustee emeritus of Princeton University and a trustee of the Pierpont Morgan Library. Among the many honors he received was that of Honorary Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire-Civil Division. In 1946, he received the first annual Award Medal of the Welfare Council for Distinguished Service to the Community. He was instrumental in establishing the Milbank Memorial Fund, an endowed operating foundation that works to improve health by helping decision makers in the public and private sectors acquire and use the best available evidence to inform policy for health care and population health. See www.milbank.org. On March 16, 1933, at the annual dinner of the Milbank Memorial Fund at the New York Academy of Medicine, Milbank urged statewide compulsory health care insurance systems on a contributory basis of percentage of Employees' Pay and Employers' profits to defray the expenses. Also at the dinner, Dr. G.F. McCleary praised the British methods saying they raised medical standards in England (New York Times March 17, 1933). Previous name partners=Harrison Tweed= Harrison Tweed became a member of Murray, Prentice & Aldrich, a predecessor of Milbank, in 1920. He also served as president of the American Law Institute, chaired the American Law Institutes's Committee on Continuing Legal Education in collaboration with the American Bar Association, and was also president of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. In addition, he served as president of Sarah Lawrence College, president of the Legal Aid Society, and was appointed by President John F. Kennedy as the first chair of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. =Morris Hadley= Morris Hadley came to the firm in 1929. He represented many large corporations, both in the United States and abroad. He authored two books: one, a biography of his father who had been president of Yale University, and the other entitled The Citizen and the Law. Mr. Hadley was a trustee of the Russell Sage Foundation and also sat on the board of trustees of both the Pierpont Morgan Library and the New York Public Library where, from 1943‚Äì1958, he served as president. =John J. McCloy= John J. McCloy was originally a partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore in New York, and joined what is today Milbank in 1946, after serving as Assistant Secretary of War from 1941-1945 under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He left the firm in 1947 to serve as president of the World Bank, and was appointed by President Harry S. Truman as High Commissioner of Germany in 1949. In 1952, he returned to the private sector and served as chair of the Chase National Bank, which under his leadership became the Chase Manhattan Bank in 1955. During this period, he also served as chair of the Ford Foundation. He returned to Milbank in 1961, but was almost immediately appointed by President John F. Kennedy as his Special Assistant on Disarmament. McCloy also served as a member of the Warren Commission following the assassination of President Kennedy. He thereafter returned to Milbank, which was renamed Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, and remained a general partner for 27 years, until he died in 1989. At Milbank, McCloy acted for the \\"Seven Sisters\\" (the leading multinational oil companies, including Exxon), in their initial confrontations with the nationalisation movement in Libya-as well as negotiations with Saudi Arabia and OPEC. Because of his stature in the legal world and his long association with the Rockefellers, and as a seven- time presidential adviser, he is sometimes referred to as the \\"Chairman of the American Establishment.\\" =Turks & Brahmins: upheaval at Milbank, Tweed= In 1990, Ellen Joan Pollock published Turks & Brahmins: Upheaval at Milbank, Tweed, a book chronicling Milbank's history and transformation into a high- grossing late-20th century megafirm. The book notes that Milbank was at one time the largest law firm in the country, with a carefully nurtured \\"insular, noble culture.\\" For 50 years, from 1931 to 1981, the firm never took on a lateral partner from another firm; all of its 65 or so partners had apprenticed with the firm from mostly Ivy league schools. Until 1984, no Milbank partner had ever left the firm to become a lateral-hire partner elsewhere. However, by 1984, the legal market had revolutionized as both new and old firms ballooned in size, dumped lockstep compensation for \\"merit\\" systems that rewarded achievers, raided each other for star players, and hustled ceaselessly for clients. Pollock's book narrates how, during the latter half of the 1980s, a determined group of partners transformed Milbank - more than doubling its size and luring on board such glamorous laterals as a former Abscam prosecutor Thomas Puccio and an Asian-business rainmaking lawyer, Alice Young. By 1989, profits per partner had doubled what they were in 1984, and the firm's overall revenues had tripled. The book chronicles the displacement and decay of what Tom Wolfe called \\"the old Protestant aristocracy\\" that once ruled the United States. Office locations=New York headquarters= Milbank's New York office is the global headquarters of the firm. Located in New York City's Hudson Yards, the firm occupies 10 floors of the 55 Hudson Yards building. Milbank moved to Hudson Yards in February 2019 from its longtime headquarters at 28 Liberty (formerly One Chase Manhattan Plaza) in New York's Financial District. =Other United States offices= In addition to the firm's headquarters in New York City, Milbank maintains two offices in the United States.Milbank Offices Washington, D.C. Milbank's Washington, D.C. practice combines the firm's traditional \\"Wall Street\\" practice - including a focus on complex international transactions and arbitrations and nationwide litigation - with experience in dealing with the federal government and the various multilateral institutions located in Washington. Los Angeles Milbank's Los Angeles office, located in the Century Plaza Towers, is the firm's largest domestic office outside of its New York City headquarters. =International offices= As counsel to foreign corporations with U.S. interests and U.S. corporations operating overseas, Milbank forged international relationships that endure today. In 1925, for example, the firm worked on a proposed Japanese bond issue for the Toho Electric Power Company. Fifty-two years later, in 1977, Milbank opened the first American law office in Tokyo, ten years before any other American law firm. Today, Milbank offices are located in key geographic regions to serve clients across the globe.

Asia/Pacific (Tokyo, Singapore, Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul) 30/F, Alexandra House, Hongkong Milbank's commitment to Japan began in 1925, when founding partner Morris Hadley traveled to Yokohama to prepare an indenture for the Toho Electric Power Company. In 1977, Milbank became the first U.S. law firm to establish an office in Tokyo under its own name, amid opposition from both the Ministry of Justice and Japan Federation of Bar Associations, who viewed it as illegal for foreign lawyers to practice in Japan at that time. Despite these protests, Milbank's office remained open through the early 1980s and was the only office of an American law firm in Japan during that time. Restrictions on foreign law firms in Japan were eased with the introduction of the attorney at foreign law system in 1987. In the same year, Milbank became one of the first international law firms to open an office in Hong Kong. Milbank was again one of the first U.S. firms to open an office in Singapore, and did so in 1985. The firm opened its Beijing office in 2006, though it has been active in China since the early 1990s. In early 2015, Milbank opened a Foreign Legal Consultant Office (FLCO) in Seoul. In Korea, the firm advises international and Korean corporations, financial institutions and government agencies on a variety of in-bound and out-bound transactions, including project finance, M&A; and private equity investments, and disputes, as well as aviation and transportation finance.

The branch was opened by the Great Western Railway in 1857, and from 1862 when the Reading-Hungerford line reached Devizes it became part of the shortest route from London to the West Country. Those services were re-routed in 1900, and the line closed in 1966. History The idea of a railway line through Devizes was first conceived in 1830, before the Great Western Railway (GWR) had begun to construct its main lines. Devizes was regularly considered by the GWR as a major stop on its London to Bristol Line but lost out to Swindon due to lack of potential traffic from Devizes. A branch to Devizes was included in plans for the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway, authorised by Parliament in 1845; however, that company could only afford to build part of its main line, from Thingley Junction near Chippenham to Westbury, before it was taken over in 1850 by the Great Western Railway. Potential construction costs were high because Devizes stands on a hill, so the town was left without a station. In 1854 the GWR finally began to build from near on the former WS&WR; line eastward to Devizes, completing the branch in 1857. In 1862, the GWR extended its Reading-Hungerford line westward via to Devizes, creating a direct link from London Paddington to Bristol which was shorter than any other route. This was the busiest period for the Devizes line, but traffic declined from 1900 after the Stert-Westbury link was built to reduce journey time by avoiding the steep inclines into Devizes. Closure The line and all its stations closed in 1966 under British Rail's Beeching cuts. The closure of the line can be accounted for by the awkward geography of the Devizes line, and the declining amounts of traffic due to alternative railway lines and the increasing popularity of road transport. Apart from a few remaining bridges and the tunnel under the grounds of Devizes Castle, there is little evidence of the railway on the landscape, and all stations and halts were demolished in 1970.

Some of their singles were released on his Immediate Records label. Their cover version of \\"Baby Don't You Do It\\", was produced by Immediate in-house record producer, Paul Raven (Gary Glitter). Musically, the band's style contained elements of both the hard R&B; of the early Small Faces (both bands would cover \\"Baby Don't You Do It\\") and The Action along with the more melodic sounds of The Kinks, The Searchers and the later period Small Faces. Visually, they sported an Edwardian look similar to the early Kinks with matching velvet jackets, ruffled shirts, tight pants, Beatle Boots and shag haircuts. Within the West of Scotland however, their look was interpreted as based on the Poet Rabbie Burns appearance in paintings of the time. Their 1964 single \\"Now We're Thru'\\" was a No. 31 hit in the UK Singles Chart. However, later singles were not chart successes outside Scotland, and no full album was completed. Some of their singles are on various compilation albums, including the Nuggets II box set on Rhino Records (one song) and The Immediate Records Story (four songs) on Charly Records.

Life Janssen was born in Angoul√™me, France, son of the paper maker Abraham Janssen and Henriette Manigault. His grandfather, Theodore Janssen de Heez, had taken refuge in France from the Duke of Alba's persecution in the Netherlands. Janssen moved to England in 1680, making his home at Wimbledon, where he bought Wimbledon manor. He was naturalised as an English subject in 1685, and later knighted by King William III on 26 February 1698. In 1694 he was a founder-member of the Bank of England, investing ¬£10,000 and becoming a director. In 1697 he published a pamphlet A Discourse concerning Banks, and in 1713 his treatise General Maxims of Trade. At the particular request of the Prince of Wales, he was created a baronet on 11 March 1715, shortly after the accession of George I. He entered Parliament in 1717 at a by-election, as member for Yarmouth (Isle of Wight). By 1720, Janssen had accumulated a fortune of almost quarter of a million pounds. However, among his business interests had been the South Sea Company, of which he was a director. On the collapse of the company he, together with the other directors, was arrested and summoned before the House of Commons to account for himself. After he and Jacob Sawbridge, the first two directors to be summoned, had been heard, a motion was proposed and passed unanimously that both \\"were guilty of a notorious Breach of Trust, as Directors of the SouthSea Company, and thereby occasion'd very great Loss to great Numbers of his Majesty's Subjects, and had highly prejudic'd the publick Credit\\". They were expelled from their membership of the Commons (as were the other directors subsequently), and their assets confiscated to make reparations to the investors ruined in the crash. Janssen was almost certainly innocent of any deliberate wrongdoing, and this was recognised by the amount of his fortune that he was permitted to retain when the rest was taken to compensate investors ‚Äì he was allowed to keep ¬£50,000, a much-higher proportion than most of the other directors. Family He married Williamza or Williamsa Henley (died 2 September 1731) on 26 January 1698 at Christ Church Greyfriars, London, and had three sons: Abraham, Henry, and Stephen. He died in 1748. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, Abraham, who had also been a Member of Parliament at the time of his father's disgrace, but never sat again after the end of that Parliament. Each of the brothers inherited the baronetcy in turn, as none had any sons; the elder two died unmarried in 1765 and 1766 respectively. His daughter Barbara married Governor Thomas Bladen and daughter Mary married Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore.  Final Years and Death  Sir Theodore continued to live quietly in Wimbledon after he was stripped of the manor in 1721, next to the present day Wimbledon Village High St. He died in 1748 and is buried in the churchyard of St Marys Church, Wimbledon. Portrayal in fiction Janssen is a central character in Robert Goddard's historical novel Sea Change.

She ended up falling in with a group of NYU students working on short art films. She then went on to study photography at the Germain School of Photography in 1981. While living in New York she worked as an assistant for fashion photographer Richard Avedon for one day. She then travelled onto India where she encountered learned Bharatanatyam dance she returned to Geneva and worked for the Red Cross. Under the pseudonym of Silda Brown,\\"Silda\\" ist ein Teil der europ√§ischen Ariane-Rakete, ‚Äûvon Braun‚Äú sind Namen aus dem Film Alphaville des Regisseurs Jean-Luc Godard she began to collect items marked with a red cross. She converted her apartment into a dentist's cabinet because she was able to acquire a practice facility at a reasonable price.Die Zeit (abgerufen am 12. November 2008) In 1990 she met the Swiss performance artist John Armleder from Geneva and became his assistant. In the same year she and Armleder moved to Villa Magica, a large old town house on the outskirts of Geneva. In 2004 Fleury and Armleder and his son St√©phane Armleder (1977), founded the Geneva Record Label Villa Magica Records. The label also published CDs and LPs from John Armleder and Sylvie Fleury, from Rockenschaub and John B. Rambo (a pseudonym for St√©phane Armleder).  Career  Fleury‚Äôs first show was at Rivolta Gallery in Lausanne in 1990 alongside Olivier Mosett and John Armleder. Through that show she met Eric Troncy and was invited to be a part of his seminal 1991 exhibition No Man‚Äôs Time at the Villa Arson in Nice, France. In 1993 Fleury participated in the curated portion of the 45th Venice Biennale. In the roaming section curated by Benjamin Weil, she had 3 models walking throughout Venice wearing reproductions of Yves Saint Laurent‚Äôs Piet Mondrian dress. Critics have labeled her work \\"post-appropriationist,\\" and her books The art of survival, First Spaceship on Venus and Other Vehicles, and Parkett #58 (with Jason Rhoades and James Rosenquist), have been featured internationally. In 2015, she won the Prix de la Soci√©t√© des arts de Gen√®ve. Fleury's work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, and the ZKM Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe.

It sold as Enovid in the United States and as Enavid in the United Kingdom. Developed by Gregory Pincus at G. D. Searle & Company, it was first approved on June 10, 1957 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of menstrual disorders. The FDA approved an additional indication for use as a contraceptive on June 23, 1960, though it only became legally prescribable nationwide and regardless of the woman's marital status after Eisenstadt v. Baird in 1972. In 1961, it was approved as a contraceptive in the UK and in Canada. Medical uses Mestranol/noretynodrel was indicated in the treatment of gynecological and menstrual disorders. Originally it was not legal to use contraception so it was marketed for menstrual relief with the side effect of inability to conceive. It has also been used to suppress lactation and to treat endometriosis in women. =Available forms= The medication contained 0.15 mg mestranol and 10 mg noretynodrel. Additional formulations containing 0.075 mg mestranol and 5 mg noretynodrel as well as 0.1 mg mestranol and 2.5 mg noretynodrel were subsequently introduced. One formulation also contained 0.075 mg mestranol and 3 mg noretynodrel. History The first published case report of a blood clot and pulmonary embolism in a woman using Enavid (Enovid 10 mg in the U.S.) at a dose of 20 mg/day did not appear until November 1961, four years after its approval, by which time it had been used by over one million women. It would take almost a decade of epidemiological studies to conclusively establish an increased risk of venous thrombosis in oral contraceptive users and an increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction in oral contraceptive users who smoke or have high blood pressure or other cardiovascular or cerebrovascular risk factors. These risks of oral contraceptives were dramatized in the 1969 book The Doctors' Case Against the Pill by feminist journalist Barbara Seaman who helped arrange the 1970 Nelson Pill Hearings called by Senator Gaylord Nelson. The hearings were conducted by senators who were all men and the witnesses in the first round of hearings were all men, leading Alice Wolfson and other feminists to protest the hearings and generate media attention. Their work led to mandating the inclusion of patient package inserts with oral contraceptives to explain their possible side effects and risks to help facilitate informed consent. Today's standard dose oral contraceptives contain an estrogen dose that is one third lower than the first marketed oral contraceptive and contain lower doses of different, more potent progestins in a variety of formulations. Enovid was discontinued in the U.S. in 1988, along with other first-generation high- estrogen COCPs.

The clinical definition of a sexual fetish would require that a person be fixated on a specific garment to the extent that it exists as a recurrent (or exclusive) stimulus for sexual gratification.Masters WH, Johnson VE, Kolodny RC: Human sexuality, 5th ed. New York: Harper Collins, 1995. An individual with a clothing fetish may be aroused by the sight of a person wearing a particular garment, or by wearing the clothing themselves. The arousal may come from the look one achieves by wearing the clothes or the way it feels while it is being worn. In the latter case, arousal may originate from the way its fabric feels (see clothing fetish by fabric type) or from the way the garment feels and functions as whole (restrictive clothing being an example). Others may also derive pleasure from collecting the fetishised garments. Relative prevalence of garment fetishism Playboy Playmate Dasha Astafieva wearing a see-through fishnet dress without undergarments, 2008. In order to determine the relative prevalence of various clothing fetishes, University of Bologna researchers obtained a sample of at least 5000 individuals worldwide from 381 Internet discussion groups. The prevalence was estimated based on (a) the number of groups devoted to a particular fetish, (b) the number of individuals participating in the groups and (c) the number of messages exchanged. The top garment fetish was clothes worn on the legs or buttocks of women (such as stockings or skirts), followed by footwear, underwear, whole-body wear (such as costumes and coats), and upper-body wear (such as jackets or waistcoats). By garment type Although almost any type of garment in theory can be the subject of a fetish, common clothing fetishes include footwear, female underwear and uniforms. A wide range of other garments have been the subject of less common fetishes. Separate from fetishes as a paraphilia are garments worn to enhance appearance, such as tight jeans or other eye-catching clothing. The difference is whether, for the person concerned, the clothing is the focus of a sexual fetish, or is merely appreciated and found pleasing. =Restrictive clothing= Clothing that limits the wearer's movement is commonly used for this property, particularly among bondage enthusiasts and often appears in bondage-related fetish fashion. Such restrictive fashion includes corsets, collars, and hobble skirts. Corsets The training corset and bondage corset has also become a staple in fetish wear, particularly among professional dominants. A submissive or slave may also be forced to wear a tightly laced corset as a form of punishment or simply restriction. And the masochistic practice known as tightlacing creates a particular type of pleasure for the wearer. In the 1980s, pop music performers such as Madonna and Cyndi Lauper reintroduced and popularized the corset as a daring example of underwear as outerwear. This influence continues to the present day in both fetish and mainstream fashion. Hobble skirts Lingerie model wearing full-fashioned stockings, with an open-bottom girdle, see-through panties, and high heels. A hobble skirt is a long, tight skirt, extending below the knees and often ankle length, which is so tight that it is difficult to walk in. When used as fetish clothing, it is often made of latex or PVC and sometimes corseted, to increase the restriction. Such skirts were briefly a mainstream fashion in the 1910s; however, they were soon abandoned as impractical. They were revived in the 1950s by John Willie and others as a bondage/fetish style. =Stockings and socks= Stocking fetishists usually find sexual partners clothed in sheer nylon or silk stockings to be sexually stimulating, or find the act of a person donning or removing a pair of stockings arousing. Some men find it arousing to collect and wear stockings, sometimes hidden under a pair of trousers.Kunzle, David (2004). Fashion and Fetishism. Sutton. Like feet and shoes, sock fetishists often require some specific attraction in the object which may include particular styles or knit patterns. People with a fetish for socks may have no special attraction to feet or shoes. Some speculate that the strong attraction some men exhibit to the smell of socks worn by women may be an example of the existence of human pheromones ‚Äì the hypothesis being that the sweat from women's feet may contain chemical attractants that arouse a male subject and that when a male subject is exposed to the smell of women's feet or footwear at a young age that young man may carry a strong psycho- chemical imprint which motivates his enthusiasm for worn socks or shoes later in life. Many male sock fetishists are also highly specific regarding the nature of the socks that stimulate them, and this may be a product of exposure to particular types of clothing during the teenage years. This belief is supported by observations that the nature of sock fetishism appears to differentiate according to age brackets and periods of clothing trends. Among men who exhibit an interest in women's socks who were in their early pubescent period during the late 1980s/early 1990s when slouch socks were a popular clothing trend, there is a tendency to exhibit a strong interest in very heavy slouchy socks, whereas younger men with a sock fetish tend to show greater interest in the short ankle-style socks that became popular in later years. There is also a regional trend in sock fetishes, with men who spent their teenage years living in northern climates exhibiting a strong interest in heavy wool socks. =Sneakers= Sneaker fetishism is another specific form of shoe fetishism. Like boot fetishism it can be accompanied by a fetish for the material from which it is made for example the rubber which the outsole and sidewall are made of can be a source of rubber fetishism. = Swimwear = Swimwear fetishism is a sexual fetish relating to swimwear. It can also involve printed or electronic material with swimwear being worn. =Jackets and coats= Jacket fetishism is usually associated with the fixation or attraction to padded nylon jackets ‚Äì though it can also be associated with leather jackets, particularly in association with Bondage (BDSM). In a survey, researchers at the University of Bologna found that 9% of members of online fetish groups were in groups related to upper-body wear such as jackets. =Jeans= The style and cut of jeans can also enhance their sexual appeal to fetishists of either gender. Jeans without pockets on the back are sometimes viewed as showing off one's buttocks and therefore more flattering. Stretch jeans are often viewed as attractive because they have the appearance of being skin tight, while not binding like regular denim jeans would. An example of fetish denim would be \\"Zip Around Jeans\\", so called because their zipper unzips starting in the front and continues all the way to the back. Other popular styles include the lace up jean and multi button style jeans. The flag for Jeans Fetish =Crop Tops (Half-Shirts)= Crop tops are particularly appealing to navel fetishists since exposure of the navel is accentuated by the bared midriff characteristic of such garments. In so doing, the crop-top can highlight navel piercings, which have become popular. = T-Shirts = T-shirts and graphic print t-shirts (t-shirts with some kind of graphic image, text, or design printed on them), especially but not limited to, people wearing tight T-shirts that are smaller than the person's regular shirt size, have become a popular subject of sexual clothing fetishism. This clothing fetish is more commonly found in men towards women, but sometimes it can be found in women towards men as well, or even in homoerotic forms with men and women of the LGBTQ+ community. It differs from crop top/half-shirt fetishism (mentioned above) because it does not particularly focus on the person baring their midriff or showing their navel, but it is the concept of the person wearing the shirts themselves, and sometimes people wearing the shirts at a smaller size than their regular shirt size to tease and partially show their breasts and bras or cleavage through the shirt if they are a woman, or partially show their pecs and abs through their shirt if they are a man. Also, some men and women have said they have a T-shirt and graphic print T-shirt fetish just because of the appearance of a woman's breasts and bra showing through the person's shirt in general or a man's pecs and abs showing through the shirt in general, even if they don't wear the shirt at a smaller, tighter size. This fetish is often synonymously compared with the Wet T-shirt fetishism that is seen at some pornographic public events (such as wet t-shirt contests) or on pornography websites with wet t-shirt fetish videos, but there is debate about whether or not it should be included as a separate fetish or not. Gender-related clothes Fetishism may include various garments typically worn by or associated with a particular gender or gender expression. For example, this could describe an individual who is attracted to people wearing masculine- associated clothing items, like basketball shorts or a man's suit. Certain gender-related elements of clothes could be the source of a fetish, include lace, ruffles, floral print, embroidery, back closures, or various colors (such as mauve and pink). Uniforms Woman in a French maid outfit, Paris. Among the most common uniforms in uniform fetish are those of a doctor, schoolgirl, police officer, military officer, nurse, French maid, sports player, waitress, cheerleader and Playboy Bunny. Some people also regard nuns' habits or even aprons as uniforms. Sometimes, a uniform may be used appropriate to what is being done. For example, someone may wear a nurse's uniform to administer an enema, a police uniform to handcuff and cage someone, or two equals dress as inmates for cell mate on cell mate activities in a prison setting or as submissive to a third (guard) player. This may add a sense of authenticity to the game play.The Visual Dictionary of Sex, Dr. Eric J Trimmer (editor), ; A & W Publishers, 1977 By fabric type=Fur= Venus with a Mirror, by Tiziano Vecellio (circa 1555) inspired Leopold von Sacher-Masoch¬¥s novel Venus im Pelz (Venus in Furs) Fur fetishism refers to the sexual fetishism that revolves around people wearing fur, or in certain cases, to the garments themselves. These materials may be fetishised because the garment acts as a fetishistic surrogate or second skin for the wearer's own skin. The material may be regarded as providing a superstimulus that is more intense than the normal response associated with real skin. This is heightened by the fact that the fur was originally an animal's skin and hair. The most famous, and one of the earliest, depictions of the topic was the semi-autobiographical novel Venus in Furs (1870) by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch. After the novel's success, Sacher-Masoch apparently decided to take on a fetish sadomasochism-lifestyle.Written in the flesh: a history of desire. Author: Edward Shorter. Editor: University of Toronto Press, 2005. , In 1884, he had sent a copy of the novel to Richard von Krafft-Ebing, who gave Sacher- Masoch immortality when, in 1891, he coined the term masochism. =Wool, Cashmere, Angora= alt= Sweater fetish is a common name for finding attraction to garments such as cardigans, twinsets jumpers, dresses, jumpsuits made of soft natural fibres in particular lambswool, angora and cashmere. =Leather= Leather fetishism is the name popularly used to describe a sexual attraction to people wearing leather and or to the garments themselves. The smell and the sound of leather is often an erotic stimulus for people with a leather fetish. Leather uniforms may also become a fetish. Leather is occasionally finished with a glossy surface and produced in bright colors, providing visual stimuli for some leather fetishists. The feel of tight leather garments worn may be experienced as a form of sexual bondage. Some bondage equipment is made from leather straps. The term \\"leather culture\\" was applied in the 1960s in the American gay sadomasochistic subculture as an umbrella term for alternative sexual practices. The pony fetish involves the use of equestrian like gear fitted to humans. =Latex/PVC= A woman in a tight black latex catsuit. Latex fetish is the fetishistic attraction to latex clothing or garments and sometimes called rubber fetishism as latex is a type of rubber. Latex or rubber fetishists may refer to themselves as \\"Rubberists\\". Varieties of latex fetishism include body inflation and attraction to transparent rubber. Latex fetishism includes wearing clothing made from latex, observing it worn by others, and enjoyment of erotic fantasies featuring latex garments, catsuits, hoods, divers or industrial protective clothing. A common latex fetish icon is the dominatrix wearing a skin-tight glossy black latex or PVC catsuit. PVC fetishism is often closely associated with latex fetishism even though the two materials are very different. PVC fetishism involves an erotic attraction to shiny plastic clothes made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurathane or similar man made materials. PVC may be mistaken for shiny patent leather. PVC fetishism also includes an erotic attraction to clothing such as clear plastic raincoats, slipcovers, custom clothing made out of clear PVC or inflatable items. Nylon fetishism includes the wearing of shiny raincoats, jackets and trousers. In the case of heterosexuals, special preferences often include nylon clothing items designed for or belonging to the other sex. =Spandex= Spandex fetishism is a fetishistic attraction to people wearing stretch fabrics or, in certain cases, to the garments themselves, such as leotards. One reason why spandex and other tight fabrics may be fetishised is that the garment forms a \\"second skin,\\" acting as a fetishistic surrogate for the wearer's own skin. Wearers of skin-tight nylon and cotton spandex garments can appear naked or coated in a shiny or matte substance like paint. The tightness of the garments may also be seen as sexual bondage. Another reason is that nylon-spandex fabric (preferred by many spandex fetishists) is often produced with a very smooth and silk-like finish, which lends a tactile dimension to the fetish ‚Äì as well as a visual one. There is a sexual attraction to leotards and other dance related clothing. This also goes for gymnasts too. In comic books, superheroes, superheroines, and supervillains are generally depicted as wearing costumes made of spandex or a similar material. The superheroines always wear skintight, very flashy and bright-coloured costumes that usually cover only just enough of the body to be presentable. Fantasies involving superheroes or the wearing of superhero costumes are commonly associated with spandex fetishism. Full-body suits called zentai entirely immerse the wearer in skin tight fabric. The suits are essentially catsuits with gloves, feet, and a hood. The wearer experiences total enclosure and those who enjoy erotic objectification might make use of the garment's anonymizing aspect. The word zentai means whole body in Japanese. =Nylon Athletic Clothing (Windpants/Windsuits)= A fashion trend from the 1990s, these pants were famous for swishing when the person walked. By the early 2000 era several internet groups had emerged dedicated to the topic of nylon windpants and athletic wear. School kids often wore them, either as sports uniforms, or merely as a fashion statement. The swishing sound and the look of the shinny nylon material arouses some people to the point of sexual pleasure. The now iconic Adidas 3 stripe look, that was available in a wide array of colors, was a popular trend with these pants. Nike also had their own nylon windpants with the famous swoosh logo on the lower leg or hip pocket. Even today there are several websites dedicated to publishing photos of people in nylon and shinny athletic wear. Windpants and Windsuits continue to arouse people to this day.

'Nowell Codex', Cotton Vitellius A.x.v. 129 r. Dorothy Whitelock, , CBE (11 November 1901 - 14 August 1982) was an English historian. From 1957 to 1969, she was the Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon at the University of Cambridge. Her best-known work is English Historical Documents, vol. I: c. 500-1042, which she edited. It is a compilation of translated sources, with introductions. Her other works include The Beginnings of English Society (1952), After Bede (1960), The Audience of Beowulf (1951), and Genuine Asser (1967), in which she argued against V.H. Galbraith's assertion that Asser's Life of King Alfred was a forgery by Leofric. Early life Whitelock was born in Leeds to Edward Whitelock and his second wife Emmeline Dawson. Edward died in 1903 but despite financial struggles, Dorothy Whitelock was able to attend the Leeds Girls' High School. Whitelock was a promising student at school and it came as no surprise when in 1921 she went up to Newnham College, Cambridge at the age of 20, where she was only one of four students in her year to study for Section B of the English Tripos under Hector Munro Chadwick. She gained a First in Part I and a Second in Part II.  Academic career  Whitelock went on to postgraduate work, as Marion Kennedy Student at Newnham (1924‚Äì26), Cambridge University Scandinavian Student at Uppsala (1927‚Äì29), and the first woman to receive the Allen Scholarship at Cambridge (1929‚Äì30)Jana K. Schulman, 'An Anglo-Saxonist at Oxford and Cambridge: Dorothy Whitelock (1901-1982)', in Women Medievalists and the Academy, ed. by Jane Chance (Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press, 2005), pp. 553-62 (at p. 553). These labours led to her first book, her 1930 translation and commentary on thirty nine Anglo-Saxon wills.Waterstone's catalogue In the same year, she became a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society (she was later elected to its Council from 1945-8). In 1930 she became a lecturer in English language at St Hilda's College, Oxford (tutor in 1935, full fellow 1937, vice principal 1951). In 1940, she was elected a Leverhulme Fellow and in 1946 became a University Lecturer in Old English at Oxford.Jana K. Schulman, 'An Anglo-Saxonist at Oxford and Cambridge: Dorothy Whitelock (1901-1982)', in Women Medievalists and the Academy, ed. by Jane Chance (Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press, 2005), pp. 553-62 (at pp. 554-55). In 1945, she became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Antiquaries. She serves as President of the Viking Society for Northern Research in 1940-1. She was elected Vice-President of the Society for Medieval Archaeology from its formation in 1957, serving until 1963. In 1957, she returned to Cambridge, and Newnham, as the Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon.Jana K. Schulman, 'An Anglo-Saxonist at Oxford and Cambridge: Dorothy Whitelock (1901-1982)', in Women Medievalists and the Academy, ed. by Jane Chance (Madison, Wis.: University of Wisconsin Press, 2005), pp. 553-62 (at p. 556). Notwithstanding these successes, throughout her career, Whitelock found herself frustrated by a male-dominated academy which often favoured male scholars at the expense of talented female academics. In 1945, following her failure to secure a professorship at the University of Liverpool, Whitelock applied for the Rawlinson and Bosworth professorship of Anglo-Saxon at the University of Oxford, a chair that had been vacated by J. R. R. Tolkien. She was unsuccessful; Tolkien himself had voted against her. In the face of such opposition she was tempted to abandon the academy altogether but her close friends, the leading Anglo-Saxon historians Sir Frank Stenton and his wife Doris, addressed a series of supportive letters to her, encouraging her to persevere. A key part of her work was lobbying for Oxford's women's colleges to have the same status as men's, finally achieved only in 1959. During the 1950s, Whitelock returned to her work with renewed vigour, producing a series of important works culminating with her most famous book, English Historical Documents in 1955. Her achievements were finally recognised in 1956, when she was elected a fellow of the British Academy. In 1957, Whitelock returned to Cambridge, where she had begun her career, succeeding Bruce Dickins as Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon (in which capacity she supervised Simon Keynes, who himself became the Elrington and Bosworth Professor between 1999-2018). Under her direction, the 'Department of Anglo-Saxon and Kindred Studies' relocated in 1967 from the Faculty of Archaeology and Anthropology to the Faculty of English and became the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic.Jana K.

Ernest E. Baguley (1863‚Äì1948) was a British engineer. Career=Employment= Baguley served an apprenticeship with R & W Hawthorn Leslie, initially at their Tyneside shipyard and later at their Forth Bank, Newcastle, locomotive works. In 1890 he moved to Stafford and became Chief Draughtsman for W G Bagnall Ltd. While at Bagnalls, he invented the Baguley valve gear for steam locomotives. Baguley became interested in motor vehicles and, in 1901, he joined the Ryknield Engine Co Ltd of Burton-on-Trent. This company failed in 1905 and Baguley became Manager of its successor, the Ryknield Motor Company. In 1907 Baguley moved to Birmingham as Manager of the newly formed Motor Division of the Birmingham Small Arms Company. =Baguley Cars Ltd= In 1911 he set up Baguley Cars Ltd which took over the assets of the (then defunct) Ryknield Motor Company. The new company started out manufacturing road vehicles, but branched out into locomotive manufacturing just before the First World War. = War Service = In the years leading up to the First World War, Baguley served in the Territorial Army and became Second-in-Command, 6th Battalion, North Staffordshire Regiment, rising to the rank of Major. He served in France from 1914 to 1915. =Baguley (Engineers) Ltd= After the War there was a decline in the production of road vehicles (probably due to competition from other manufacturers) and an increase in the production of railway equipment. The name of the company was changed from Baguley Cars Ltd to Baguley (Engineers) Ltd on 10 April 1923. Following a dispute with their partners Drewry Cars. Ltd, Baguley (Engineers) Ltd went into decline and entered liquidation in 1931. Most of the plant and effects, including Major Baguley's own Baguley car, were sold at auction on 10 November 1931. =E. E. Baguley Ltd= Major Baguley was a great survivor and, he set up a small repair business for Baguley products at Clarence Street, Burton-on-Trent. A new company, E. E. Baguley Ltd, was registered on 30 April 1932 and was soon building locomotives again. In 1934 E. E. Baguley Ltd moved to larger premises at Uxbridge Street, Burton-on-Trent. The company merged with Drewry to form Baguley-Drewry Ltd in 1962. Personal life In June 1921, Baguley married E.G.M. Coussmaker, the daughter of the Rector of Hamstall Ridware in Staffordshire. He retired in 1946, and died on 14 November 1948.

After the eruption of Mount Erciyes about 2.6 million years ago, ash and lava formed soft rocks in the Cappadocia Region, covering a region of about . The softer rock was eroded by wind and water, leaving the hard cap rock on top of pillars, forming the present-day fairy chimneys. People of G√∂reme, at the heart of the Cappadocia Region, realized that these soft rocks could be easily carved out to form houses, churches, and monasteries. These Christian sanctuaries contain many examples of Byzantine art from the post- iconoclastic period. These frescos are a unique artistic achievement from this period. In the 4th century, small anchorite communities began to form in the region, acting on the instruction of Saint Basil of Caesarea. They carved cells in the soft rock. During the iconoclastic period (725‚Äì842) the decoration of the many sanctuaries in the region was held to a minimum, usually symbols such as the depiction of the Christian cross. After this period, new churches were dug into the rocks, and they were richly decorated with colourful frescoes. When the Cappadocian Greeks were expelled from Turkey in 1923 in the population exchange between Greece and Turkey the churches were abandoned, but at the same time they were kept hidden, as their owners were the only ones who knew how to find them. Tokalƒ± Kilise Fresco of the Crucifixion on the apse of Tokalƒ± Kilise Tokalƒ± Kilise (or the Church of the Buckle), is the largest church in G√∂reme. Restoration of the church was completed during the 1980s. The only surviving example of its architectural origins is the Church of Mar Yakub in the Tur Abdin region located around present day Mardin. One noted feature of the church is the main nave containing ninth century frescoes in \\"provincial\\" style, the more recent additions are three apses of the 11th-century frescos, which are rendered in \\"metropolitan\\" style. The church contains frescos of the twelve apostles, the saints and scenes from the life of Jesus. The church also has a crypt underneath the nave. Tokalƒ± kilise is formed of four chambers: the Old Church, the larger New Church, the side chapel (parekklesion), and the Lower Church. The Old Church dates to the 10th century. It was originally a single-naved barrel-vaulted church. But its apse was destroyed when the New Church was added at the end of the 10th or early 11th century. Now the Old Church provides entrance to the New Church. The Old Church is decorated with pale hues of red and green painted in strips to represent scenes from the New Testament and depictions of some saints. Panels of rich indigo painted with pigments from Badakshan lapis lazuli stone dominate the New Church : scenes from the New Testament, miracles of Christ, the first deacons, episodes from the life of St. Basil (one of the Cappadocian Fathers), depictions of Leades (one of the Forty Martyrs) and St. Menas. The expense would have been considerable. The value of the lapis lazuli alone is estimated to be around 31.5 pounds of gold. Scholars have speculated as to the identity of the donors, with many suggesting the Phokades, a prominent Cappadocian family. However, there is no convincing evidence to support this. The New Church was carved out of the eastern wall of the Old Church and decorated with Eastern- style arches and a series of arcades. The Paracclesion, located at the left side of the New Church, is a barrel-vaulted chapel with a single apse. The Lower Church has three aisles and a burial space or krypto. =Fresco Decoration of the Old Church at Tokali Kilise= The most elaborate decorative program of the Old Church at Tokali Kilise is the Christological cycle located in the barrel vault of the one-aisled basilica. On each side of the vault there are three registers of narrative containing 32 scenes depicting the traditional tripartite division of the life of Christ; the Infancy, the Miracles, and the Passion.Epstein, Ann Wharton. Tokali Kilise: Tenth-Century Metropolitan Art in Byzantine Cappadocia. Washington DC: Harvard University Press, 1986. 16. The spine of the vault is decorated with a row of medallions containing portraits of Old Testament prophets and saints. The narrative begins at the southeast corner of the top register with the Annunciation, it then reads towards the west (left to right), crosses to the other side of the spine of medallions and finishes with the Murder of Zacchariah in the northeast corner to complete the Infancy chapter. The second chapter of Christ's life, the Miracles, occupies the middle of the three registers (or the second register from the top) and also reads left to right, skipping over the spine of medallions. The Miracles begins right after the Infancy ends with the Flight of Elizabeth and ends with the Raising of Lazarus. Lastly the lowest register tells of the Passion and reads in the same manner and direction as the first two registers. It begins with the Entry into Jerusalem and ends with the Descent into Limbo (Anastasis).Kostof, Spiro. Caves of God: The Monastic Environment of Byzantine Cappadocia. Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1972. 169‚Äì181. There are three images related to the narrative of the vault but located outside of it; the Transfiguration in the west tympanum, the Ascension in the eastern tympanum, and Presentation in the Temple located on the south side of the east wall.Rodly, Lyn. Cave Monasteries of Byzantine Cappadocia. Cambridge: Cambridge University, 215. Due to its semi-isolated location in the Cappadocian region, the frescos in the Old Church of Tokali Kilise (as well as many other rock-cut churches in the area) are based on the Gospel of James rather than the canonical Gospels.Epstein, Ann Wharton. Tokali Kilise: Tenth-Century Metropolitan Art in Byzantine Cappadocia. Washington DC: Harvard University Press, 1986. 17. This difference, from the more metropolitan centers of the empire like Constantinople, accounts for the unusual sequencing of the Christological narrative. For example, typically the Flight of Egypt would be the final scene of the Infancy chapter but in the Old Church two more scenes are included; the Murder of Zacchariah and the Flight of Elizabeth which begins the Miracles chapter. This anomaly occurs because the artist was adhering to the Gospel of James which includes both of these scenes. Although other rock-cut churches in Cappadocia also based their narratives on the Gospel of James, none are exactly like the Old Church at Tokali Kilise. Only fragments of this Christological cycle narrative were implemented in other churches.Kostof, Spiro. Caves of God: The Monastic Environment of Byzantine Cappadocia. Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1972. 178. The Last Supper scene in the Christological cycle of the Old Church The style of the frescos are consistent with other imagery of the period and region. The images do not necessarily render reality; the figures do not display convincing volume and the drapery is unnaturalistic being more concerned with a geometric style of representation. The figures are placed in the front of the picture plane which alludes that the artist(s) were not concerned with realistic depth. These stylistic traits (proportions, flatness and geometric abstraction) can also be compared to frescos in other parts of the empire like Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. However an entirely regional trait is also evident in the \\"tendency to name otherwise anonymous characters through the association with an object or action in the text (Bible).\\" An example is the figure filling an urn with water in the Miracle at Cana scene who is named Antlioin which is derived from the Greek word \\"to draw out\\".Epstein, Ann Wharton. Tokali Kilise: Tenth-Century Metropolitan Art in Byzantine Cappadocia. Washington DC: Harvard University Press, 1986. 40‚Äì42. The composition of the Christological cycle as whole has symbolic meaning. Considering the medallions containing portraits of the Old Testament prophets is located at the highest point of the vault, the spine, it is representing the beginning or the first age of revelation and they are the figures who foretell the coming of Christ and his deeds on earth. These prophecies are then depicted throughout the rest of the narrative in the Infancy, Miracles and Passion registers that fill the remainder of the vault ‚Äì the second age of revelation. The narrative continues on the eastern tympanum with the Ascension, when Christ's resurrected body is taken to heaven. This is the beginning of his Holy influence and initiates the third age of revelation. The composition of the narrative as a whole reflects the progression of revelation before, during and after Christ's life on earth.Kostof, Spiro. Caves of God: The Monastic Environment of Byzantine Cappadocia. Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1972. 191. =Fresco Decoration of the New Church at Tokali Kilise= The New Church at Tokali Kilise is a much larger church than the Old Church and therefore has much more decoration. There are two main fresco cycles and a large amount of saints, clergymen and martyrs distributed throughout the rest of the wall space. Like in the Old Church, the Christological cycle is the most elaborate and extensive decoration of the New Church. Located in the nave the Infancy, the Miracles and the Passion are depicted in high quality painting. The narrative starts in the north bay of the nave and proceeds in a register above the arcades. View of the Christological cycle in the New Church A few important scenes were reserved for more prominent locations; the Ascension, Benediction of Apostles, Pentecost, and Mission of Apostles are located in the center and south bays of the nave vault.Rodly, Lyn. Cave Monasteries of Byzantine Cappadocia. Cambridge: Cambridge University, 216. The other major narrative cycle in the New Church at Tokali Kilise is the life of Saint Basil. St. Basil was the principal religious figure of the Cappadocian region and it is therefore suspected that the New Church was dedicated to himVan Dam, Raymond. Becoming Christian: The Conversion of Roman Cappadocia. Philadelphia: University of Philadelphia Press, 2003. 169. There are only two known fresco cycles of the life of St. Basil, the other located in a chapel in Balkam Deresi (also in Cappadocia). The cycle in the New Church contains scenes from the earlier part of the narrative while the chapel at Balkam Deresi depicts the later scenes.Kostof, Spiro. Caves of God: The Monastic Environment of Byzantine Cappadocia. Cambridge: The MIT Press, 1972. 164 Located in the transept on the lower walls of the north bay multiple scenes from this local Cappadocian saint were painted in the New Church. The scenes include: The Dispute for the Church of Nicaea, Basil and the Emperor Valens, Prayer of the Arians, Prayer of the Orthodox, Meeting of St. Ephraim and St. Basil, Absolution of the Sinful Woman and Funeral of Basil.Rodly, Lyn. Cave Monasteries of Byzantine Cappadocia. Cambridge: Cambridge University, 216. Accompanying each fresco is an inscription taken directly from the biographical writings of Pseudo-Amphilochio describing the scene.Epstein, Ann Wharton. Tokali Kilise: Tenth-Century Metropolitan Art in Byzantine Cappadocia. Washington DC: Harvard University Press, 1986. 77. Unlike majority of the rock-cut churches the patronage of the New Church is surprisingly known. Located on the nave cornice a fragment of sentence was written which translates to: 'Your (most holy church) was completely decorated by Constantine out of love for the monastery (of the heavenly angles). He adorns his new work with twenty venerable images‚Ä¶' (it continues with descriptions of the twenty mentioned scenes). A second inscription located in the north apse is translated as: 'The bema was decorated by ‚Ä¶ Nikephoros, at the expense of Leon, son of Constantine. You who read (this), pray for them through the Lord. Amen.' Through these two inscriptions it is inferred that the painter was Nikephoros and there were two patrons, Constantine and his son Leon. Neither patron is identified by a title meaning one of two things. Either they were people of minor importance or they were so important and well known that it was unnecessary to include their titles. Considering it would have been very expensive to fund such elaborate fresco decoration it is more likely that they were wealthy and therefore well known, thus no titles were necessary. Stylistically the New Church frescos are similar to paintings of the same time period found in Constantinople which suggests that the patrons may have paid for a workshop to come to Cappadocia specifically to decorate the New Church. This fact also points to wealthy patrons.Rodly, Lyn. Cave Monasteries of Byzantine Cappadocia. Cambridge: Cambridge University, 217‚Äì218. As for Nikephoros, the artist name mentioned in the second inscription, it should not be assumed that he was the only artist. It is more likely that he was the master of the workshop responsible for the frescos and therefore received the credit for the work. In this scenario Nikephoros would have had multiple apprentices helping him with the many tasks associated with creating frescos. It is also unclear in the second inscription as to exactly what part of the decoration Nikephoros was responsible for. However, with much research and evidence the leading scholar on Tokali Kilise, Ann Wharton Epstein, argues that Nikephoros was responsible for the entire decoration of the New Church.Epstein, Ann Wharton. Tokali Kilise: Tenth-Century Metropolitan Art in Byzantine Cappadocia. Washington DC: Harvard University Press, 1986. 33‚Äì34. Elmalƒ± Kilise Rock Chapel Goreme (Elmalƒ± Kilise) Elmalƒ± Kilise (or the Apple Church) a smaller cave church. Was built around 1050 and has carved into four irregular pillars the sign of a Greek cross with these pillars support its central dome. Restoration on the church was completed in 1991, but the frescos continue to chip off, revealing a layer of earlier paintings underneath. The church's paintings depict scenes of the saints, bishops, and martyrs. and to the right of the altar, a Last Supper with the symbolic fish (the letters of the word fish in Greek, ŒôŒßŒòŒ•Œ£, stand for \\"Jesus Christ, Son of God, the Savior\\"). The name of the church is believed to refer to a reddish orb in the left hand of the Archangel Michael in the dome of the main apse, or possibly to an apple tree that grew in the vicinity. Azize Barbara Kilisesi Fresco of Christ Pantocrator in Azize Barbara Kilisesi Azize Barbara Kilisesi, (or the Church of Saint Barbara) Barbara was a Greek martyr who was imprisoned by her father in order to protect her from the influences of Christianity. Barbara nevertheless found a way to practice her faith and her father tortured and killed her. Built in the late 11th Century, the church was possibly built as a tribute to the Martyr-Saint. The church has the same layout as √áarikli Kilise. The church has a cross-dome with one central apse, two side apses and two columns. The dome depicts Christ on the Throne, with geometrical patterns painted in red ochre, painted directly on the rock, believed to be symbolic in nature. Another fresco with the large locust possibly representing evil, which is warded off by the protection of two adjacent crosses. The north wall of the church contains a fresco of St. George and St Theodore on horse-back struggling against the dragon and snake. The monks drew red ochre lines on the rocks, to give the impression that cut stones were used in the construction. Yƒ±lanlƒ± Kilise Fresco of Onuphrius (on left) Yƒ±lanlƒ± Kilise (the Snake Church) is a simple barrel-vaulted church with a low ceiling and long nave. It is named for the fresco of Saints Theodore and St George slaying the dragon (or snake as depicted in the fresco). The church also has a fresco of Emperor Constantine and his mother Helena depicted holding the True Cross. Legend has it that she discovered the cross upon which Jesus was crucified after seeing it in a dream, and that a piece of the cross is still buried in the foundations of the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. Other sections of the cross are in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and in St. Peter's in Rome. Another interesting portrait is the one of Saint Onuphrius on the upper wall to the right of the entrance. The saint lived the life of a hermit in the Egyptian desert near Thebes, Egypt and is usually depicted with a long gray beard and wearing only a fig leaf. Karanlƒ±k Kilise Fresco of Christ Pantocrator on the ceiling of Karanlƒ±k Kilise Karanlƒ±k Kilise (or the Dark Church) was a monastic compound built in the 11th century. It is a domed church with one main apse, two small apses and four columns. It was decorated with scenes from the New Testament: Christ Pantocrator, Nativity, Adoration of the Magi, First Bath, Last Supper, Betrayal of Judas, Crucifixion, Anastasis. After the Turkish invasion it was used as a pigeon house until the 1950s. After 14 years of scraping pigeon droppings off the walls, these newly restored frescos, depicting scenes from the New Testament, are the best preserved in all of Cappadocia and a fine example of 11th-century Byzantine art. Part of the narthex or vestibule however collapsed opening part of the church's roof to the sky. This caused damage to the fresco with Christ‚Äôs Ascension and the Benediction of the Saints, whereas the other scenes only partially remain where the wall collapsed. The church's name possibly comes from a small oculus looking out of the narthex which only lets in a very small amount of light. This feature is what has preserved the richness of the pigments and allowed them to survive the passage of time. √áarƒ±klƒ± Kilise √áarƒ±klƒ± Kilise √áarƒ±klƒ± Kilise (the Church with Sandals) the name comes from the two footprints at the bottom of the Ascension fresco at the church's entrance (this fresco is said to be an exact copy of the one contained at the Church of the Ascension in Jerusalem). The church is cut into the same rock as Karanlik Kilise. The footprints themselves, have many unconfirmable legends attached to them. The church is carved into a cross floor plan with intersecting vaults. The church's frescos, which date to the 11th century, contain the four Evangelists, the Nativity and the Crucifixion, the Baptism, the Adoration of the Magi, and other New Testament themes.

Plot summary The story revolves around the occurrences during the latest series of the hit 'reality' star search programme, Chart Throb. The show was the brainchild of Calvin Simms, who assumed a Simon Cowell style role as the mean, English judge. He is accompanied by the extravagant but bitchy former rockstar-turned-transsexual reality TV star, Beryl Blenheim, and the ageing pop manager Rodney Root.

The vessel was a turret ship that was designed by the British Royal Navy Captain Cowper Coles and built by the Samuda Brothers shipyard in Cubitt Town, London as a speculative effort; Prussia purchased the ship during the Second Schleswig War against Denmark, though the vessel was not delivered until after the war. The ship was armed with four guns in a pair of revolving gun turrets amidships. She was named for Arminius, the victor of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. Arminius served as a coastal defense ship for the first six years of her service with the Prussian Navy. She saw extensive service in the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian wars during the process of German unification. The vessel was the primary challenge to the French blockade of German ports during the latter conflict. After the wars, Arminius was withdrawn from front-line service and used in a variety of secondary roles, including as a training ship for engine-room crews and as a tender for the school ship . The ship was eventually sold in 1901 and broken up for scrap the following year.  Design = General characteristics and machinery = The warship that came to be SMS Arminius was designed by Captain Cowper Coles, a British Royal Navy officer and advocate of turret-armed ironclad warships. Arminius was nearly identical to the Danish ironclad Rolf Krake, also designed by Coles. The vessel was constructed with transverse frames and constructed with an iron hull, which contained eight watertight compartments. The ship was long at the waterline and long overall. The ship had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. She was designed to displace but at combat load, Arminius displaced up to . The ship's crew consisted of ten officers and 122 enlisted men. She carried a number of smaller boats, including two pinnaces, two cutters, and one dinghy. Arminius was not a particularly successful design; she suffered from severe, fast rolling, especially in heavier seas. She also shipped a great deal of water over the bow and was unbalanced in steering. The ship turned rapidly to starboard but was sluggish in turning to port. Indeed, the ship was required to have the rudder at 15 degrees to port in order to remain on a straight course. It was also impossible to control the ship with only sail power. The ship was powered by a single two-cylinder single expansion engine built by J. Penn & Sons, Greenwich. The engine drove a single two-bladed screw that was in diameter. Four transverse trunk boilers, each of which had four fireboxes apiece, supplied steam to the engine. The boilers were also built by J Penn & Sons, Greenwich, and were arranged in a single boiler room. Limited electrical power was provided by a single generator, which supplied 1.9 kilowatts at 55 volts. The ship was equipped with a schooner rig with a surface area of 540 square meters. The propulsion system was rated at and a top speed of , though on trials, Arminius reached and . The ship carried of coal, which enabled a range of at a cruising speed of . = Armament and armor = As built, Arminius was equipped with a main battery of four rifled, bronze 72-pounder cannon, but after delivery to the Prussian Navy they were replaced with four L/19 guns manufactured by Krupp. These guns were supplied with a total of 332 rounds, and could elevate to 12 degrees. At maximum elevation, the guns could engage targets out to . After 1881, four machine guns were installed, along with a single torpedo tube mounted in the bow above the waterline. Arminiuss armor consisted of wrought iron backed with teak plating. The conning tower was protected by of wrought iron on of teak. The armored belt ranged in thickness from of iron on the bow and stern to 114 mm amidships, the entire length of which was backed by 229 mm of teak. The two turrets were armored with 114 mm of iron on of timber.  Service history  Illustration of one of Arminius 4 guns She was built by the Samuda Brothers shipyard in London as a speculative project, possibly to sell to the Confederate Navy. The ship was laid down in 1863 and launched on 20 August 1864. Prussia instead purchased the ship on 20 August 1864 for some 1,887,000 gold marks, paid in part through public donations, and commissioned her on 22 April 1865 as SMS Arminius. The Prussians had hoped to secure the vessel by September, but delivery was delayed by the British government over the Second Schleswig War between Prussia and Denmark. As the British were sympathetic to Denmark, they prevented the ship from being delivered until after the war was concluded. Arminius served as a harbor defense ship for six years, through 1871. Along with the ironclad ram , Arminius was the first armored warship acquired by the Prussian Navy. At the outbreak of the Austro-Prussian War in mid-1866, Arminius was mobilized along with Prinz Adalbert, the only other Prussian ironclad. The ships were initially based in Kiel, but in the opening days of the war, Arminius raced to Hamburg via the Skagerrak and the Kattegat, a distance of some , in 100 hours, an impressive feat for an early ironclad warship. Without a naval threat from Austria, the Prussian navy therefore concentrated its effort against the Kingdom of Hanover. For the remainder of the conflict, Arminius operated out of Geestem√ºnde, under the command of Reinhold Werner, and the mere appearance of Arminius caused several Hanoverian coastal batteries to surrender. On 15 June, Arminius and a pair of gunboats, and , covered the crossing of the Elbe river by General Edwin von Manteuffel and some 13,500 soldiers to attack the city of Hanover. By the end of the month, the Prussian army had decisively defeated the Austrians at K√∂niggr√§tz and ended the war. On 3 October 1866, the ship raced the US Navy's monitor in Kiel; Arminius was two knots faster than the American vessel. In November 1868, the ship was laid up for an overhaul that included replacing her original rig with a lighter rigging with pole masts. A weather deck, which extended from just astern of the forward turret to her stern, was also fitted and ventilators for the hull were extended up through the new deck. In 1870, the ship had her sailing rig removed altogether, as it had been determined that she could not be steered while under sail, and the masts blocked the firing arcs of the gun turrets. Arminius (left) with (right) At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871, the Prussian Navy concentrated Arminius and the armored frigates , , and in the North Sea naval base Wilhelmshaven. Arminius was stationed in Kiel at the outbreak of war, but managed to break through the French blockade by hugging the Swedish coast, which her shallow draft permitted. Her passage through Swedish territorial waters also protected the ship from French attack. Despite the great French naval superiority, the French had conducted insufficient pre-war planning for an assault on the Prussian naval installations, and concluded that it would only be possible with Danish assistance, which was not forthcoming. The four ships, under the command of Vice Admiral Jachmann, made an offensive sortie in early August 1870 out to the Dogger Bank, though they encountered no French warships. The three armored frigates thereafter suffered from chronic engine trouble, which left Arminius alone to conduct operations. Captain Otto Livonius commanded the ship during the war. In the course of the war, she sortied from the port over forty times; these also failed to result in major combat, though she occasionally traded shots with the blockading French warships. For the majority of the war, Arminius was stationed in the mouth of the Elbe along with the ironclad ram Prinz Adalbert and three small gunboats. The three armored frigates remained off the island of Wangerooge. On 11 September, the three frigates were again ready for action; they joined Arminius for another major operation, though it too did not encounter French opposition. The French Navy had by this time returned to France. After being removed from front-line service in 1872, she was used as a training vessel for naval engineers. The ship was decommissioned in 1875 and placed in reserve. Her ram bow allowed her to be used as an ice-breaker in Kiel in the 1880s. In 1882, she was used as a tender for the cadet training vessel . The ship was rebuilt in 1888; during the refit the propulsion system was overhauled and replaced with German-built equipment and two searchlights were installed. Four machine guns were installed, along with a torpedo tube. The ship was ultimately stricken from the naval register on 2 March 1901 and sold to shipbreakers for 72,000 gold marks. Arminius was broken up for scrap the following year.

Piet Hein Superegg In geometry, a superegg is a solid of revolution obtained by rotating an elongated superellipse with exponent greater than 2 around its longest axis. It is a special case of superellipsoid. Unlike an elongated ellipsoid, an elongated superegg can stand upright on a flat surface, or on top of another superegg. This is due to its curvature being zero at the tips. The shape was popularized by Danish poet and scientist Piet Hein (1905‚Äì1996). Supereggs of various materials, like the one shown, were sold as novelties or \\"executive toys\\" in the 1960s. A 1-ton superegg made of steel and aluminium was placed outside Kelvin Hall in Glasgow in 1971, on occasion of a lecture by Piet Hein. Mathematical description The superegg is a super-ellipsoid whose horizontal cross-sections are circles. It is defined by the inequality :\\\\left\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}{r}\\\\right^p + \\\\left\\\\frac{z}{h}\\\\right^p \\\\leq 1 where r is the horizontal radius at the \\"equator\\" (the widest part), and h is one half of the height. The exponent p determines the degree of flattening at the tips and equator. Hein's choice was p = 2.5 (the same he used for the Sergels Torg roundabout), and r/h = 3/4.Piet Heins Superellipse (in Danish) The definition can be changed to have an equality rather than an inequality; this changes the superegg to being a surface of revolution rather than a solid.Weisstein, Eric W. \\"Superegg.\\" From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Superegg.html See also * Egg of Columbus References Category:Algebraic curves Category:Surfaces Category:Executive toys Category:Educational toys ","title":"Superegg"},{"id":"10405350","text":"Holod may refer to: *Kholod (Russian: –•–æ–ª–æ–¥), a Russian supersonic rocket *Holod (river), a tributary of the Cri»ôul Negru in Bihor County, Romania *Holod, Bihor, a commune in Bihor County, Romania ","title":"Holod"},{"id":"10405356","text":"Ivan Rendiƒá (27 August 1849 in Imotski ‚Äì 29 June 1932 in Split) was a Croatian sculptor.  Biography  He began sculpting early on in life, thanks to the stoneworking tradition of the island of Braƒç, where he was raised. He finished arts school in Venice in 1871 and afterwards became a part of the Fiorentine sculpting atelier. Later he mostly lived and worked in Trieste where he made the bulk of his works. In Croatia, most of his works were displayed in Zagreb and Split. He was the first famous and educated Croatian sculptor of Modern age. He worked in the Realist style with elements of naturalism, especially in finer details. Rendiƒá made around 200 statues. His most famous works were public monuments raised in honour of famous Croats which remain over all parts of Croatia, for example, his statues of Andrija Meduliƒá, Julije Kloviƒá, Krsto I Frankopan, Ivan Gunduliƒá, Nikola Juri≈°iƒá and August ≈†enoa at Zrinjevac park in Zagreb, as well as Petar Preradoviƒá and Andrija Kaƒçiƒá Mio≈°iƒá also in Zagreb, Ljudevit Gaj in Krapina, and busts of Eugen Kumiƒçiƒá, emperor Franz Joseph I and others in Supetar. From 1921 he lived in Supetar, where he attempted in vain to form a school of arts. He finished his life in poverty. Because of its support to the Illyrian movement and unification of Dalmatia with the rest of Croatia, he was the target of attacks of Italianists and Italian expansionists, especially during his work in Trieste.

In Serbia This music was very popular during the early 1900s in Serbia. Today, this music can be heard in bohemian part of Belgrade, Skadarlija. It is also most popular in the northern part of Serbia, Vojvodina. Some famous performers of this music are Zvonko Bogdan, Ksenija Cicvariƒá, and Toma Zdravkoviƒá. The lyrics are often romantic and depict the city life, as well as some more rural scenes. In North Macedonia Some of the most prominent Starogradska muzika performers are Ansambl Biljana from the city of Ohrid, which was considered an important center for this music style in the past along with Bitola, Prilep and others. The emergence of the Starogradska music scene is related to the development of the cities and the bourgeoisie under the influences from the West in the Ottoman occupied Macedonia during the 19th century. Unlike the rural folk which portrays the life in the villages and the nature surrounding them, the hard agricultural work in the fields etc. the Starogradska muzika lyrics are about the life in the city, its famous loves and tragedies, its famous characters (be they rich traders or poor beggars) etc. Starogradska music uses instruments such as violins and clarinets instead of rural ones such as gajda for example. Also, while rural folk performers usually wear traditional village costumes, the starogradska music performers are usually dressed in European old city fashions (suits, hats and neckties, as well as accessories such as pocket watches, walking sticks etc.). An important, if not the most important part of the Macedonian old city music is the musical genre called ƒåalgija (not to be confused with chalga, which is a contemporary Turbofolk style in Bulgaria and Serbia). In both rural and urban Macedonian folk, songs about famous revolutionaries also exist.

Share of the Automobiles Cottin & Desgouttes, issued 10. January 1922  History  In 1904, Pierre Desgoutte started manufacturing automobiles under the name ‚ÄúDesgouttes & Cie‚Äù, in Lyon, France. The first model was the type A, powered by a 9.5-liter, 45 hp, six-cylinder engine. Only two cars of this type were built. In December 1905, a chassis with a four- cylinder, 24/40 hp engine was presented at the Salon de Paris. It exhibited many innovative features and enjoyed a huge success. At the beginning of 1906, Pierre Desgoutte was joined by a wealthy industrial partner, Cyrille Cottin. They decided to call the new company ‚ÄúAutomobiles Cottin & Desgouttes‚Äù, Pierre Desgoutte acting as Technical Director, whereas Cyrille Cottin would manage Sales. The company progressively specialized in luxury and sports models. Between 1906 and 1914, most of the production was devoted to four-cylinder models. En 1907, the company produced a 2.5 liter, 12 hp model that was so well accepted by the public that it was produced without any major changes for more than four years. Over the next years, growth was regular and the factories thrived. In 1913, Cottin & Desgouttes could be proud of producing close to 450 cars with a total staff of 300, which was very high at the time, since the usual rule was one car per year per employee. Well known for the very high quality of their production, Cottin & Desgouttes was also famous for the interest they demonstrated in ‚Äúhigh-tech‚Äù solutions: they were among the first to use a single-block engine, direct drive transmission and universal joint-based transmission. = Racing = The fame of Cottin & Desgouttes was also due to their participation in a number of car races. As soon as May 1906, a Cottin & Desgouttes car driven by engineer Auguste Fraignac won the Limonest race in its category. Encouraged by this excellent result, the company decided to participate in more and more important races, from the Press Cup in 1907 (where their car achieved the best gas mileage) to the Grand Prix de France in 1911, in Le Mans, where the specially built model set the lap record before having to abandon due to steering problems. Cyrille Cottin, a great sportsman himself, drove at a number of races, rallies or other sports events. = World War I = At the beginning of World War I, the company produced a series of fast Utility Vehicles and delivered several large 36 hp ‚ÄúTorpedoes‚Äù to the French Army General Staff. The reliability of the trucks used by the Army was legendary. During the war, Cottin & Desgouttes also built special engines for tractors. In 1915 the Cottin & Desgouttes factory manufactured aircraft motors for Gnome et Rh√¥ne. = After the war = At the end of the War, Cottin & Desgoutte had well equipped production facilities, and their financial situation was good enough to start again producing luxury cars. Their staff, accustomed to high quality standards, easily moved from the war-time production back to tourist cars. The manufacturing of trucks was continued. In addition to the powerful models built immediately after the war, the company launched a smaller, all new and lower priced car in 1922, the type M. Shortly after this car was presented, Pierre Desgoutte quit the company. Paul Joseph, selected by Cottin to replace him, was charged with building a more powerful and faster car, based on the type M, and aimed at racing. One such car won the Grand Prix du Tourisme de l'Automobile Club de France, which resulted in the launch of the ‚ÄúGrand Prix‚Äù model. Around this time, Cottin & Desgouttes started his first research on aerodynamic profiling; the results of this work were used in the 1925 models, most notably for the 4-seat ‚Äúboat-torpedo‚Äù with its streamlined rear. In 1925, the company launched the ‚ÄúSans Secousse‚Äù, with Houdaille-type paddle-based shock absorbers and separate springs for the 4 wheels. At the front, the suspension was handled by leaf springs with 2 vertical guide bars supporting the hydraulic shock absorbers; in the rear, it was handled by oscillating semi-trees with double universal joints and 2 overlapping leaf springs. When the car was presented at the Paris Salon, Gaston Doumergue, President of the French Republic congratulated the Lyon car manufacturer for his historic invention, that would promote the French Automobile Industry. Cottin reportedly replied that the government had contributed to this invention - by the very bad quality of the roads. The Sans-Secousse was also very successful outside France. In 1930, the first Saharan Tourist Car Rally was won by four ‚ÄúSans Secousse‚Äù cars that demonstrated a high level of resistance. These cars were 14 hp sport roadsters, with no wings or other useless accessories, yielding a high weight to power ratio, separate springs in front and four leaf springs at the rear, with a de Dion-type bridge; they could drive very fast even on low quality dirt roads. = Twilight = In spite of all these achievements, the company was yet another victim of the 1930s crisis. A ‚ÄúSans Secousse‚Äù cost twice the price of a six-cylinder Citro√´n. The last car built by Cottin & Desgouttes was much more conventional, powered by a lateral 3.8-liter, six-cylinder engine. Production stopped in 1931. In 1933, the last Cottin & Desgouttes, assembled with stock parts, were sold. In 1968, the 1911 Grand Prix car was used in the opening race sequence of the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, driven by its then owner, John 'Jumbo' Goddard.

Not all provinces and territories were initially contributing members. In the late 1970s ICURR was formally established through an Order of Council with Ontario and Memorandums of Agreement between ICURR and the participating provinces and territories. Presently, ICURR is funded by all Canadian provinces and territories, but it was formerly supported at the federal level as well by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). The Committee provides support to Canadian local and regional governments through its Muniscope service. Current services include a lending library, focusing on local, regional and municipal government, governance, planning (urban, rural, environmental and regional), and housing, primarily in Canada, and research services for funding partners and subscribers. In the past, ICURR independently produced and published research reports as well as collaborated on research reports with the Institute of Public Administrators of Canada (IPAC), the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). ICURR also facilitates the planning and document management for the annual Meeting of Provincial and Territorial Ministers Responsible for Local Government in Canada.

Other sources call it \\"Stac Lii.\\" Geography and geology Stac Lee is located in the North Atlantic and forms part of the St Kilda archipelago of the Outer Hebrides. Lying in the north east of the St Kilda group, Stac Lee is around north east of Hirta, the main island, and west of the west cape of the island of Boreray. Administratively, Stac Lee is part of the Na h-Eileanan Siar. =Topography and Ascents= A St Kildan landing on Stac Lee (1901) Stac Lee is a precipitous sea stack, i.e. a detached escarpment, high. Other sources give an altitude of , or above the sea bed. Having a prominence greater than , it is a Marilyn. The nearby Stac an Armin reaches , making these the highest sea stacks in Britain.Heights from Haswell-Smith (2004); National Trust website states 191 metres & 165 metres respectively. Seen from the south, the rock appears as an imposing cliff as broad as high, while from the west it has the aspect of a thin needle with a top bevelled at an angle of 45¬∞. The most impressive view is that obtained from the south-east, from where Stac Lee looks like a giant hook. A small bothy on Stac Lee was formerly used by St Kildan fowlers. It is big enough to accommodate two people and is dry inside. The St Kildans would land here by lassoing an iron peg, and then jumping when the swell rose up. Along with his sister Evelyn, Norman Heathcote climbed the stack in 1899 and wrote about it in his book St Kilda and in a climbing journal. He said that it was \\"comparatively easy\\" to climb although getting ashore onto the stack was \\"a most appalling undertaking\\" involving jumping ashore and climbing an overhanging cliff covered in slippery seaweed to a stanchion above sea level. It was climbed on 21 May 1990 by three National Trust for Scotland wardens. Its summit was reached by six climbers, including Marilyn baggers and supporting rock climbers, on 13 October 2014.Marilyn bagger from Peterborough scratches 22 year itch, BBC News, 15 October 2014.

The party was formed by a splinter group from the Nigerian People's Party, the group was led by Waziri Ibrahim, a politician and businessman from Borno. Waziri was one of the leaders of the three associations that formed the nucleus of NPP. The original intention of NPP was to transcend the politics of ethnicity and to promote the cause of both the prominent ethnic groups and ethnic minorities. However, the entry of Nnamdi Azikiwe to NPP led to a power struggle in which Waziri lost. Waziri then led a group of minorities in the north and some southerners to form the Great Nigeria Peoples Party. Though the original intentions of leaders of the party was to surpass ethnic and sectarian politics, the party's strength nevertheless lay in the northeast, among the Kanuris and some northern minorities. Elections In the 1979 elections, the party won a total of 8 senate seats, mostly from the Northeast and about 8.4% of total votes in the senate election. In the House of representative election, the party won about 43 seats and close to 10% of the overall votes in the election. In the presidential election, Ibrahim Waziri, the party's candidate, took home about 10% of the total votes in the election. The party in the Second Republic During the run-up to the election, the party went into an informal alliance with the Unity Party of Nigeria, the alliance was viable in some of the states and house elections where either party was less visible. Though, the party was less critical of the Shagari presidency than the UPN, the party, nevertheless, supported an oppositional role and tried to form alliances with other southern parties and some groups in the PRP to form a progressive movement. However, the party was embroiled in an internal crisis in 1981, when some notable members of the party were publicly supporting the dominant National Party of Nigeria. The party leadership expelled most of the members but the rift and subsequent actions only widened the strains of the party.

As a result of the experiment he was hospitalized for two days, but later made a full recovery. The test convinced skeptics of the time who thought that the black widow's venom might not be dangerous to humans. Early life and career An Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan article notes that Allan Walker Blair was born in Brussels, Ontario. His family moved to Regina when he was 11. He earned a BA from the University of Saskatchewan and an MD CM degree from McGill University in Montreal, Canada, in 1928. After teaching pathology at the University of Alabama [1929-34], he studied surgery at the Winnipeg General Hospital in Manitoba, Canada [1934-35]. Blair was the first Canadian awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship to study cancer at New York Memorial Hospital, in 1935‚Äì36. He visited cancer treatment centers in Great Britain, Germany, Sweden, Belgium and France in 1936-37. The Allan Blair Cancer Center in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada is named in honour of this doctor. Envenomation experiment The front-page headlines of the November 16, 1933, edition of the Tuscaloosa News read, \\"U. Of A. Professor Lets Spider Bite Him, Suffers 3 Days Agony.\\" The physicians who attended to him praised him for \\"his courage but also for his persistence and skill in carrying on his investigation so long to such a successful conclusion.\\" \\"Blair chronicled the bite's effects on his body for two hours, until he could write no more. And then his assistants took over for the remaining two days.\\" According to the September 12, 1942, edition of The New Yorker, the results of his experiment were published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, December, 1934, issue. It was written by Samuel Hopkins Adams [\\"A Reporter at Large - Notes on an Unpleasant Female\\"] that Dr. Blair conducted the experiment, \\"with a view to providing an opportunity for complete scientific observation.\\" In 1933, many disagreed as to whether a Black Widow spider bite actually caused the symptoms reported. Until then, only a few tests had been completed and they lacked validity for various reasons. Further testing ensured that no other factors influenced the findings, as a true experiment must be conducted governed by strict controls. Most importantly, findings of tests must be replicable. Dr. Blair's methodology was certainly different from other experiments conducted in this time and region. In 1932, the infamous \\"Tuskegee syphilis experiment\\" started in Alabama. Conducted by the U.S. Public Health Service, poor African- Americans who had contracted syphilis were left untreated in order to study the effect of this over time on participants who were never told of the true nature of their symptoms. The experiment was named one of the top ten human interest stories of 1933. In an article in The Wall Street Journal, Alex Boese stated, \\"A fellow entomologist had conducted the same self-experiment 12 years earlier.\\" In order to achieve a scientifically true effect, the findings must be that \\"which can be regularly reproduced by anyone who carries out the appropriate experiment in the way prescribed.\\" Dr. Blair was hoping to determine whether being bitten provided victims with any protection from the effects of a second bite. Unfortunately, the first bite proved so painful he chose not to place himself in the same position twice. His decision not to repeat the test may also have been influenced by the fact he had a wife and young family. The physician in attendance are quoted as having never before witnessed \\"more abject pain manifested in any other medical or surgical condition.\\"  References   Category:1900 births Category:1947 deaths Category:University of Alabama faculty Category:University of Saskatchewan alumni Category:McGill University alumni ","title":"Allan Blair"},{"id":"10405630","text":"Princethorpe College is a Catholic independent day school located in Princethorpe, near Rugby, Warwickshire, England.

The series was created by Michael J. Weithorn, and featured an interracial marriage and a subsequent blended family. Synopsis=Premise and first season= Set in Baltimore, Ronald Freeman (Frankie Faison) is a widowed African-American dentist who marries Ellen Davis (Stephanie Faracy), a divorced white kindergarten teacher who was one of his patients. Ron has two sons from his first marriage, 17-year-old earnest conservative Terry (Claude Brooks) and daydreaming 14-year-old troublemaker Lester (Adam Jeffries), while Ellen has a teenage daughter, studious, cause-driven Katie (Brigid Conley Walsh). Ellen's ex-husband, Leonard (played in guest appearances by Paul Sand), who is accepting of her second marriage, would occasionally visit her while attempting to get his life back on track. Although the series did focus on race issues, most episodes focused on the family adjusting to their new living situation and the three children going through adolescence. =Second season= In the second season of the series, Faison was replaced by Cleavon Little as Ron Freeman. Nancy Walker, who was suffering from lung cancer, continued to star on the series, but ultimately only appeared in half the season's episodes due to her treatments and compromised health. Before long, due to the sudden loss of her physical mobility, Walker went on to appear in a motorized wheelchair for the majority of her second-season episodes. Terry went off to Marshall State University that fall, not far from home. Ellen accepted a new teaching job at Cortez Junior High, and during the season, she finally realized her long-time talent as a painter. She began to showcase some of her work at local art exhibits, in hopes of launching a new side career. Early in 1992, Robert (Norman D. Golden II) was introduced. Robert, who went by the nickname \\"Twist\\", was a young neighbor boy who attached himself to the Freemans, stealing scenes and causing an uproar, usually involving Lester and Terry along the way. Meanwhile, Little's physical appearance began to look more gaunt during the course of the season, as the actor disclosed he was battling colorectal cancer. =Cancellation and cast deaths= Fox shortened the season order for True Colors by February sweeps, and kept the episode total at 21. The new episode aired on April 12, 1992 wound up being the series' last, as Fox cancelled True Colors one month later. However, Walker, who had continued working into the winter months until she could no longer do so, died on March 25, 1992, after the series had produced what would be its last episode, but less than a month before the last original episode aired. On October 22, 1992, Little died of cancer.

History Following the demise of the Sarasota French Film Festival in 1996, John Welch began researching and planning an independent film festival. He hired Jody Kielbasa as Executive Director and the first \\"mini-festival\\", featuring eight independent films, six actors and a gala fundraiser was held in January 1999. The county controversially funded the festival double what it requested, for a total of $50,000. The investment was defended as good for tourism. In 2002, the St. Petersburg Times highlighted the festival's potential for marketing and distribution, and, in 2003, Variety called the festival \\"one of the edgier, more interesting entrants on the scene.\\" In 2006, the start date was changed from January to April. In 2008, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune wrote that the festival had evolved to be more about funding than premieres. Amid financial problems, Welch and others resigned from the executive committee in 2009, citing a different vision than that of the current festival. The festival has since grown, showing 252 films and bringing more than 100 filmmakers and actors to the Sarasota area over its ten-day run of April 4‚Äì13, 2014. The Sarasota Herald-Tribune said in 2014 that the festival was now a \\"showcase for serious independent films and the cinephiles who love them.\\" It has integrated smaller programs, including UN Women's \\"Through Women's Eyes\\" Film Festival and the student-focused \\"YouthFEST\\" The 2015 Sarasota Film Festival Education Program features a documentary summer camp for students.

She was the author of three books of poetry and three posthumous volumes. Flanders won the Discovery/The Nation Award, the Juniper Prize, and the Pushcart Prize three times, among many other awards. Life Jane Ann Hess (Flanders) was born in Waynesboro, Pennsylvania on March 26, 1940. She lived in Waynesboro until leaving for Bryn Mawr College in 1958. Her Pennsylvania roots were very deep and inform much of her work. Her parents remained in the house where she grew up until somewhat after her death, and her ancestors had lived in Pennsylvania for many generations. After two years teaching English at the Punahou School in Hawaii (from 1962 through 1964, well before Barack Obama was in attendance), she obtained an M.A. in English (history of the English language) at Columbia University. Though she had considerable financial and other support, she declined to complete her work toward a Ph.D., regarding herself more as an artist than a scholar. After her 1966 marriage to Steven Flanders, she had three children, who were brought up in Washington, D.C. and Pelham, New York. At various times she taught at Clark University, Sarah Lawrence College, the University of Cincinnati, and the University of Pittsburgh, among other institutions She died of cancer on April 12, 2001 after an illness that had begun well before her January 1999 diagnosis. As many of her poems evidence, she was strongly interested in many of the arts. She was an excellent pianist and majored in music in college. A memorial plaque at the \\"Jane Flanders Nook\\" on the Bryn Mawr campus describes her as \\"Poet, Musician, Gardener.\\" Her work appeared in The Atlantic, Chelsea, Commonweal, The Massachusetts Review, The Nation, New England Review, The New Republic, The New Yorker, Poetry, and other periodicals. Her work is widely admired by poets and other literary figures. Joyce Carol Oates said of her first published volume that, \\"Many of her poems have the bite and sting of Ann Sexton's poetry, but they are admirably restrained as well, tracing the necessary journey one makes in \\"coming back\\" to one's deepest self after a busy, extroverted life.\\" Publishers Weekly described her as \\"a radiant poet,\\" a characterization Karl Kirchwey adopted as the title of an appreciation in which he compares her to Elizabeth Bishop. Ben Howard opened a review in Poetry by saying, \\"Jane Flanders's gentle poems juxtapose the romantic image and the homely fact, the operatic agony and the mundane tribulation.\\" Andrew Hudgins in The Hudson Review characterized the entire body of her work: \\"In her wise and often humorous poems Flanders constantly probes the commonplace, seeking what message it has to reveal about the infinite or to discover in what way a particular moment contains the eternal.\\" Books *Leaving and Coming Back (Quarterly Review of Literature, 1980) *The Students of Snow (University of Massachusetts Press, 1982) *Timepiece (University of Pittsburgh Press, 1988) *Sudden Plenty (The Bunny and the Crocodile Press, 2003) *Manifesto d'Amore (The Bunny and the Crocodile Press, 2005) *Dandelion Greens (The Bunny and the Crocodile Press, 2009) References Category:2001 deaths Category:1940 births Category:People from Waynesboro, Pennsylvania Category:Deaths from cancer Category:Bryn Mawr College alumni Category:American women poets Category:20th-century American poets Category:20th-century American women writers ","title":"Jane Flanders"},{"id":"10405775","text":"Map showing major uprisings and rebellions in the last years of Sui dynasty. The transition from Sui to Tang refers to the transition period between the end of the Sui dynasty and the start of the Tang dynasty, when the former dynasty's territories were carved into a handful of short-lived states by its officials, generals, and agrarian rebel leaders, and the process of elimination and annexation that followed which ultimately culminated in the consolidation of the Tang dynasty by the former Sui general Li Yuan. The transition started roughly around the year of 613 when Emperor Yang of Sui launched his first of three failed campaigns against Goguryeo, leading to a number of desertions in the army and the start of agrarian revolt against the Sui, and ended in 628, when Emperor Gaozu's son Li Shimin annexed the agrarian rebel ruler Liang Shidu's state of Liang, thereby once again unifying most of China under a single power.  Sui campaigns against Goguryeo and the start of rebellions  Emperor Yang of Sui, a portrait painting by the Tang artist Yan Liben (c. 600-673)As of 611, Sui Dynasty had just enjoyed more than two decades of peace and prosperity, as China had been united under it since it destroyed Chen Dynasty in 589, and aside from border conflicts with Eastern Tujue (which had since become a vassal state under its Qimin Khan Ashina Rangan) and Goguryeo, and one brief internal conflict between Emperor Yang of Sui, who became emperor in 604, and his brother Yang Liang the Prince of Han, the realm had not seen war. When Goguryeo's king Yeongyang refused to pay homage to Emperor Yang in 610, Emperor Yang decided to plan a campaign to conquer it, and both he and the people believed that the conquest would be easy. The logistics of staging the attack on Goguryeo, however, took much human and other tolls, as the building of a fleet and, particularly more so, the shipping of food and other supplies to the base of operations, Zhuo Commandery (Ê∂øÈÉ°, roughly modern Beijing), caused major disruptions in the farming cycle and major deaths in those conscripted to ship the supplies to Zhuo Commandery. In response, in 611, in northern China, those who were unwilling to be conscripted began to rise as agrarian rebels, led by leaders such as Wang Bo (ÁéãËñÑ) and Liu Badao (ÂäâÈú∏ÈÅì), and while Emperor Yang initially did not consider these rebels serious threats, the local governmental militias were unable to quell them. Family tree of the transition from Sui to Tang. Despite this, Emperor Yang launched his first campaign against Goguryeo in 612, crossing the Liao River into Goguryeo territory in spring 612. Emperor Yang personally led part of the army to put the important city Liaodong (ÈÅºÊù±, in modern Liaoyang, Liaoning) under siege, while he sent the Xianbei generals Yuwen Shu and Yu Zhongwen (‰∫é‰ª≤Êñá) to lead the rest of the army deep into Goguryeo territory, heading toward the Goguryeo capital Pyongyang, joined by the fleet commanded by the southern Chinese general Lai Hu'er. Emperor Yang, however, was never able to capture Liaodong, while Yuwen and Yu, advancing nearly to Pyongyang, were defeated by the Goguryeo general Eulji Mundeok and forced to withdraw with heavy losses. By fall 612, Emperor Yang was forced to terminate the campaign and withdraw as well, with only minor territorial gains. About 300,000 men had been lost in the campaign. Not deterred, Emperor Yang launched a second campaign against Goguryeo in 613, even though the agrarian rebellions were becoming more numerous and serious. He again headed for Liaodong himself and put it under siege, while sending Yuwen Shu with another Xianbei general Yuchi Yichen toward Pyongyang. While he was sieging Liaodong, however, the northern Chinese general Yang Xuangan, in charge of logistics near the Sui eastern capital Luoyang, rose in rebellion, attacking Luoyang. When Emperor Yang heard the news, he withdrew his forces and sent Yuwen and Qutu Tong back to Luoyang ahead of himself, and Yuwen and Qutu joined with Fan Zigai (Ê®äÂ≠êËìã) and Wei Wensheng (Ë°õÊñáÊòá), the commanders of forces that Emperor Yang had left at Luoyang and Chang'an respectively, to defeat Yang Xuangan. Emperor Yang carried out heavy-handed reprisals against actual or perceived adherents of Yang Xuangan, but such actions did not deter further rebellions. Despite this, Emperor Yang launched a third campaign against Goguryeo in 614. As Lai Hu'er reached the Yalu River, however, Goguryeo submitted, sending Yang Xuangan's Turkic confederate Husi Zheng (ÊñõÊñØÊîø), who had fled to Goguryeo, back to Sui as a sign of submission. Emperor Yang terminated the campaign, but when he again summoned Yeongyang to pay homage to him, Yeongyang ignored his summons. Emperor Yang began to plan a fourth campaign, which, however, he was never able to launch. Meanwhile, in the fall of 615, while Emperor Yang and Empress Xiao were conducting a tour of the northern frontier, Qimin Khan's son and successor Shibi Khan launched a surprise attack against Yanmen Commandery as a reprisal for the emperor's proposal to give a princess to his brother and for the treacherous murder of one of his close advisors. The khan's wife Princess Yicheng, a relative of the emperor who had been personally honored by the empress during an earlier visit, sent them a secret warning about the Turkish attack. The imperial entourage fled to the fortified commandery seat at present-day Daixian, Shanxi, where Shibi Khan's forces besieged them on September 11.Â§ßÊ•≠ÂçÅ‰∏ÄÂπ¥ ÂÖ´ÊúàÁô∏ÈÖâ Academia Sinica Sima Guang, Zizhi Tongjian, Vol. 182. Yu Shiji advised the emperor to raise morale among the soldiers by promising promotion and rewards, as well as promising to abandon the unpopular campaigns against Goguryeo; this had the desired effect and Sui forces loyally rushed to the area to lift the siege. Meanwhile, however, the empress's brother Xiao Yu had gotten the emperor to seek further assistance from Princess Yicheng, who was administering military affairs at home in her husband's absence. She sent a false report to the khan that a northern attack had been launched against the khaganate; between this report and others announcing the Chinese reinforcements, Shibi Khan lifted the siege and returned north. With credit for his salvation muddled, Emperor Yang followed the advice of Su Wei and Yuwen Shu and reneged on most of his promises, causing great resentment among the military..  Disintegration of the Sui state  Map of the situation in northern China during the transition from the Sui to the Tang, with the main contenders for the throne and the main military operations Despite (or perhaps because of) increasing agrarian rebel activities in northern China, however, Emperor Yang did not return to Chang'an or stay at Luoyang, but went to Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) in fall 616. With his departure from Luoyang, the rebels near Luoyang coalesced under the leadership of Yang Xuan'gan's former strategist Li Mi, who was proclaimed the Duke of Wei and considered the presumptive eventual emperor by most rebel leaders throughout northern China. Li, however, was not able to capture Luoyang and never claimed the imperial title. Meanwhile, Yuchi Yichen made an attempt to destroy the rebels north of the Yellow River, but while he enjoyed some successes, Emperor Yang and his prime minister Yu Shiji, fearing Yuchi Yichen's military strengths, recalled him under guise of a promotion, allowing the rebel activities north of the Yellow River to reinvigorate themselves and become difficult to control, under the leadership of Dou Jiande. By 617, a number of other major rebel leaders also began to control significant portions of territory. These include: * Du Fuwei, agrarian rebel, occupying the modern southern Anhui region. * Gao Kaidao, agrarian rebel, occupying the modern extremely northern Hebei region. * Liang Shidu, agrarian rebel, occupying the modern central Inner Mongolia region, declaring himself the Emperor of Liang. * Li Gui, formerly a Sui official, occupying the modern central and western Gansu region, declaring himself the Prince of Liang. * Li Yuan, formerly a Sui official (and Emperor Yang's cousin), occupying the modern central Shanxi region, announcing that he wanted to make Emperor Yang's grandson Yang You the Prince of Dai, then at Chang'an, emperor. * Lin Shihong, agrarian rebel, occupying the modern Jiangxi and Guangdong region, declaring himself the Emperor of Chu. * Liu Wuzhou, agrarian rebel, occupying the modern northern Shanxi region, declaring himself the Dingyang Khan. * Luo Yi, former a Sui general, occupying the modern Beijing region. * Xiao Xian, formerly a Sui official, a grandson of Emperor Xuan of Western Liang, occupying the modern Hubei, Hunan, and Guangxi region, declaring himself the Emperor of Liang. * Xue Ju, agrarian rebel, occupying the modern eastern Gansu and western Shaanxi region, declaring himself the Hegemonic Prince of Western Qin. * Zhu Can, formerly a Sui official, roving with his army in the modern southern Henan and southeastern Shaanxi region, first declaring himself the Prince of Jialuolou, and then the Emperor of Chu. Several of these rebel leaders‚Äîincluding Li Yuan, Liu Wuzhou, Liang Shidu, Dou Jiande, and Gao Kaidao‚Äîformally submitted to Ashina Duojishi and received Eastern Tujue military aid, with Ashina Duojishi's strategy apparently to keep China divided. In winter 617, Li Yuan captured Chang'an, declaring Yang You emperor (as Emperor Gong), while honoring Emperor Yang as Taishang Huang (retired emperor); these declarations were not recognized by most of Sui territory, which still recognized Emperor Yang as emperor. Li himself became regent with the title of Prince of Tang.  Death of Emperor Yang, founding of Tang, and end of Sui  Map showing how Li Yuan established Tang Dynasty, including battles of Huoyi, Hedong and Chang'an Portrait of Li Yuan as Emperor Gaozu of TangMeanwhile, Emperor Yang, while realizing that the empire was in turmoil, felt secure under the protection of the elite Xiaoguo Army (È©çÊûú) at Jiangdu, and while he sent his general Wang Shichong to Luoyang to try to defend Luoyang against Li Mi's attacks, appeared to do little to quell the rebellions otherwise. Not wanting to return to northern China, he considered officially moving the capital to Danyang (‰∏πÊ•ä, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu, south of the Yangtze River). Meanwhile, the Xiaoguo Army soldiers, who were predominantly northerners and missed their homes, began to desert, and this met with heavy- handed punishment from Emperor Yang. In fear, the remaining Xiaoguo Army officers formed a plot, supporting the general Yuwen Huaji the Duke of Xu (Yuwen Shu's son) as their leader. In spring 618, they carried out a coup and killed Emperor Yang. Yuwen declared Emperor Yang's nephew Yang Hao, the Prince of Qin, the new emperor, but retained power himself as regent. He abandoned Jiangdu and headed back north, commanding the Xiaoguo Army. Soon, news of Emperor Yang's death spread throughout the empire. At Chang'an, Li Yuan responded by having Yang You yield the throne to him, establishing the Tang Dynasty as Emperor Gaozu. At Luoyang, seven of the leading officials declared another grandson of Emperor Yang, Yang Tong the Prince of Yue, emperor, and Yang Tong was recognized as Sui's emperor by most of the commanderies that still recognized Sui sovereignty. With both the Sui administration at Luoyang and Li Mi fearing Yuwen's northward advancement, they formed a temporary alliance in which Li Mi recognized Yang Tong as his sovereign. After Li Mi repelled Yuwen Huaji, however, Wang Shichong, who opposed the alliance, seized power from the other officials and became regent, and the alliance with Li Mi was broken. Later that year, in a surprise attack, Wang defeated Li Mi, forcing Li Mi to flee to Tang. Li Mi was later killed by Tang forces when he tried to reestablish his own independence. Meanwhile, after Xue Ju died in early 618 and was succeeded by his son Xue Rengao, the Tang general Li Shimin the Prince of Qin (Emperor Gaozu's son) defeated and killed Xue Rengao, annexing his Qin state into Tang. At the same time, Dou Jiande further consolidated his holdings north of the Yellow River and killed Yuwen Huaji (who had poisoned Yang Hao and declared himself Emperor of Xu), but was unable to get Luo Yi to submit to him, and Luo subsequently submitted to Tang. Around the same time, Zhu Can, facing heavy resistance from the populace against his cruelty, vacillated between submitting to Yang Tong's Sui regime and Tang, eventually surrendering to Sui. In summer 619, Wang Shichong had Yang Tong yield the throne to him, ending Sui and establishing a new state of Zheng as its emperor.  Reintegration under Tang  A portrait of Emperor Taizong of Tang. Hanging scroll, color on silk. Size 271 x 126.8 cm (height x width). Located in 437x437px Around the same time, Li Gui's official An Xinggui (ÂÆâËààË≤¥) captured Li Gui in a coup and surrendered the state to Tang. Tang, however, was facing a threat on a different front, as Liu Wuzhou made a major attack south, taking over much of modern Shanxi, which Tang had controlled, and appearing poised to further attack Tang's capital Chang'an. Around the same time, the lower Yangtze region, which had been in a state of confusion ever since Emperor Yang's death, was coalescing around three different competing figures‚Äîthe former Sui official Shen Faxing, who declared himself the Prince of Liang and controlled much of the territory south of the Yangtze; the rebel leader Li Zitong, who controlled Jiangdu and the surrounding regions, declaring himself the Emperor of Wu; and Du Fuwei, who submitted to Tang and was created the Prince of Wu. In late 619, Tang forces, commanded by Li Shimin, began a counterattack against Liu Wuzhou. By summer 620, Li Shimin had defeated Liu, who abandoned his territory and fled to Eastern Tujue. His Dingyang state was integrated into Tang. After defeating Dingyang, Li Shimin had his sights set on Zheng. He advanced to the Zheng capital Luoyang and put it under siege. Many Zheng cities surrendered to Tang, forcing Wang Shichong to seek aid from Dou Jiande's Xia state. Dou, reasoning that if Tang destroyed Zheng, his own Xia would be cornered, agreed, and he advanced south toward Luoyang, seeking to lift the siege. Around the same time, Du Fuwei(now using the name Li Fuwei, having been granted the imperial surname of Li by Emperor Gaozu) defeated Li Zitong, who in turn defeated Shen, forcing him to commit suicide. Li Zitong now had Shen's former territory, while Li Zitong's former territory was held by Li Fuwei in Tang's name. In spring 621, with Dou approaching, Li Shimin advanced east to the important Hulao Pass and held position there. When Dou engaged him, he defeated Dou and captured him. In fear, Wang surrendered. Emperor Gaozu executed Dou while exiling Wang (although Wang was subsequently killed by the Tang general Dugu Xiude (Áç®Â≠§‰øÆÂæ∑), whose father had been executed by Wang). Wang's Zheng state and Dou's Xia state were annexed by Tang, although former Xia territory soon rose under the leadership of Dou's general Liu Heita, who declared himself the Prince of Handong, and modern Shandong, which had been controlled by the agrarian leader Xu Yuanlang but had successively submitted to Zheng and then to Tang, rose as well under Xu, who declared himself the Prince of Lu. Also in 621, Emperor Gaozu's nephew Li Xiaogong the Prince of Zhao Commandery attacked Xiao Xian's Liang state in southern China, putting the Liang capital Jiangling under siege. Xiao, not realizing that relief forces were approaching, surrendered, and most of his state was annexed by Tang, while some of Xiao's army submitted to Lin Shihong. Around the same time, Li Fuwei defeated Li Zitong, forcing Li Zitong's surrender, and Li Zitong's Wu state was also annexed by Tang. In spring 622, Li Shimin defeated Liu Heita, forcing Liu to flee to Eastern Tujue, but Liu returned later that year with Eastern Tujue aid, reoccupying the former Xia territory. In winter 622, Li Shimin's older brother Li Jiancheng the Crown Prince defeated Liu again, and in spring 623, Liu, in flight, was betrayed by his official Zhuge Dewei (Ë´∏ËëõÂæ∑Â®Å) and executed by Li Jiancheng. Earlier, Lin Shihong had died, and his Chu state dissipated, with the cities gradually submitting to Tang, and soon after Liu's death, Xu, who had repeatedly been defeated by Tang forces, was also killed in flight. By this point, other than Liang Shidu and Gao Kaidao in the extreme north, China was largely reunited, if somewhat nominally, under Tang rule. In fall 623, however, with Li Fuwei at Chang'an, Li Fuwei's lieutenant Fu Gongshi rebelled at Danyang, declaring himself the Emperor of Song and controlling the territory formerly under Li Fuwei's control. By 624, Li Xiaogong had defeated and killed Fu, reintegrating Song territory into Tang, while Gao, faced with a coup led by his subordinate Zhang Jinshu (ÂºµÈáëÊ®π), committed suicide, and his Yan state was also integrated into Tang. Meanwhile, Liang Shidu, protected by Eastern Tujue aid, was holding up against Tang attacks, and Tang itself was continually harassed by Eastern Tujue raids. After Li Shimin ambushed and killed Li Jiancheng and another brother, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi in 626 and effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to yield the throne to him (as Emperor Taizong), however, Tang began to turn the situation around. By 628, with Eastern Tujue in internal turmoil due to disagreements between the Jiali Khan Ashina Duobi (Ashina Duojishi's younger brother) and the subordinate Tuli Khan, Ashina Shibobi (ÈòøÂè≤ÈÇ£‰ªÄÈâ¢Ëãæ, Ashina Duojishi's son), it was no longer able to protect Liang Shidu, and under Tang siege, Liang Shidu's cousin Liang Luoren (Ê¢ÅÊ¥õ‰ªÅ) killed Liang Shidu and surrendered. All of China was now under the rule of Emperor Taizong.

He was a pioneer of the Caesarean section under modern antiseptic conditions, becoming world famous after the success of his first such operation in 1888, at what was then the Glasgow Lying-in Hospital and Dispensary, now the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital, an institution he was deeply involved with. He was honorary President of the first international Congress on Obstetrics and Gynaecology, in 1892. His son Samuel James Cameron followed in his footsteps, becoming Reguis Professor of Midwifery at Glasgow in the 1930s. Early life Murdoch Cameron was born in Glasgow in 1847 the son of a successful timber merchant, Samuel Cameron (25 June 1811 ‚Äì 27 January 1886), who originated from the Gaelic-speaking farming communities on the Isle of Mull, Argyllshire, and his wife Mary Clow, daughter of William Clow of Drymen, Stirlingshire. He studied medicine at the University of Glasgow qualifying as MB in 1870, and MD in 1872. Early professional life Specialising in obstetrics at his practice in the Townhead district of Glasgow, Cameron was almost immediately appointed Physician to the Glasgow Lying-in Hospital after his graduation. He retained this post until becoming Physician Accoucher to Glasgow's Western Infirmary in 1878. From about 1884 he acted as Professorial Assistant to William Leishman, Professor of Midwifery at Glasgow. And in 1888 he was appointed Obstetric Physician to the Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital. He also acted as lecturer on gynaecology at Glasgow Queen Margaret‚Äôs College and was a leading fundraiser for the campaign to erect a new Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital on the Rottenrow site in 1880-1. Caesarean section First three Caesarean section patients In an improvised operating theatre crowded with doctors and undergraduates on the top floor of the Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital on 10 April 1888, Murdoch Cameron carried out the first Caesarean section under modern antiseptic conditions. The patient, Catherine Colquhoun, was a rachitic dwarf (i.e. her skeleton was affected by rickets) and so was incapable of natural birth. Cameron, who as an undergraduate had worked as a surgical dresser to the pioneer of antiseptic surgery Joseph Lister at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, helped transform the Caesarean section, under antiseptic conditions, from a dreaded and little used procedure, that usually ended with the death of the mother, into the routine and safe operation it has become. Controversial appointment In recognition of his pioneering work Cameron was appointed honorary President of the first international Congress on Obstetrics and Gynaecology, held in Brussels, in 1892. In 1894, on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for Scotland, Sir George Trevelyan, Murdoch Cameron succeeded Leishman to the position of Professor of Midwifery at the University of Glasgow. It was an appointment that created furious controversy in some quarters. In an anonymous letter to The Times, London, on 8 January 1894, one correspondent condemned Murdoch Cameron‚Äôs election as ‚Äòa heavy blow to the prestige and prosperity of Scotch Universities‚Äô.The Times, London, 8 January 1894. Dr Cameron‚Äôs only claim to the position, the correspondent wrote, was that he ‚Äòis an ardent Gladstonian partisan‚Äô. Nevertheless, Cameron held the position of Professor of Midwifery for thirty-two years, and was awarded an honorary LLD for ‚Äòa long period of faithful, useful and distinguished service‚Äô The Glasgow Herald, Glasgow, 29 April 1930. by the University of Glasgow at his retirement. During four decades of academic teaching, Cameron taught four of his successors to the Chair of Midwifery: John Martin Munro Kerr, Samuel James Cameron, James Hendry and Robert Aim Lennie. Murdoch Cameron died in Glasgow in 1930. Boer War Incident In a famous incident on 23 February 1900, a large crowd of students at the University of Glasgow surrounded the German lecturer, Professor Alexander Tille. The students berated Professor Tille, first English translator of Nietzsche‚Äôs Thus Spoke Zarathustra, for an article in Die Woche in which he condemned British conduct in the Boer War. As the students attempted to strip the unapologetic Tille of his professorial gown, he sought refuge in Murdoch Cameron‚Äôs lecture room. Cameron, acting as mediator between the students and Tille, arranged a meeting between both sides. At the conclusion of which Professor Cameron, asking the students to ‚Äòforgive and forget‚Äô,The Times, London, 24 February 1900. shook hands with Tille on their behalf. A Medical Family Murdoch Cameron married Agnes Wallace at Kilsyth, Stirlingshire in 1873. He was the father of Samuel James Cameron, successor to the Regius chair of Midwifery at Glasgow in the 1930s. Murdoch Cameron‚Äôs fourth child, Agnes Wallace Cameron, was among the first generation of female medical graduates from a Scottish University. Graduating MB from Glasgow in 1904, Dr A. W. Cameron was later a paediatric specialist to Glasgow Parish Council. Cameron‚Äôs eldest daughter, Jean Wallace Cameron, was Matron of the Stirling Maternity Hospital in the 1920s and ‚Äò30s. While his second daughter, Mary Clow Cameron, was lecturer in French at the University of Glasgow, who with her husband, Leon Maurice Pitoy, Chevalier L√©gion d‚Äôhonneur, also lecturer in French at Glasgow, founded the Pitoy French language prize at the University in 1938.

For example the total levels of antibodies isotypes or classes: Immunoglobulin M, Immunoglobulin G, and Immunoglobulin A. It is important in quantification of free light chains in diseases such as multiple myeloma. Quantification is important for disease classification and for disease monitoring once a patient has been treated (increased skewing of the ratio between kappa and lambda light chains after a patient has been treated is an indication of disease recurrence). It is performed by measuring the scattered light at an angle from the sample being measured.Overview at mcg.edu In diagnostic nephelometry, the ascending branch of the Heidelberger- Kendall curve is extended by optimizing the course of the reaction so that most plasma proteins‚Äô (from human blood) measurement signals fall at the left side of the Heidelberger-Kendall curve, even at very high concentrations. This technique is widely used in clinical laboratories because it is relatively easily automated. It is based on the principle that a dilute suspension of small particles will scatter light (usually a laser) passed through it rather than simply absorbing it. The amount of scatter is determined by collecting the light at an angle (usually at 30 and 90 degrees). Antibody and the antigen are mixed in concentrations such that only small aggregates are formed that do not quickly settle to the bottom. The amount of light scatter is measured and compared to the amount of scatter from known mixtures. The amount of the unknown is determined from a standard curve. Nephelometry can be used to detect either antigen or antibody, but it is usually run with antibody as the reagent and the patient antigen as the unknown.Clinical Immunology and Seriology 3rd Ed., Stevens, pg 127, F.A. Davis Company In the Immunology Medical Lab, two types of tests can be run: \\"end point nephelometry\\" and \\"kinetic (rate) nephelometry\\". End point nephelometry tests are run by allowing the antibody/antigen reaction to run through to completion (until all of the present reagent antibodies and the present patient sample antigens that can aggregate have done so and no more complexes can form). However, the large particles will fall out of the solution and cause a false scatter reading, thus kinetic nephelometry was devised. In kinetic nephelometry, the rate of scatter is measured right after the reagent is added. As long as the reagent is constant the rate of change can be seen as directly related to the amount of antigen present.

He has spent his professional career working as a sculptor, graphic designer and illustrator. His work is in public sites in the United States, South America and Japan. Jorge Blanco (b. 1945) is an international artist who has created a distinctive sculptural language over more than thirty years. His expressions on positive lifestyle are invitations to value its simplicity. Blanco has placed 25 public art sculptures in large format across the globe. In addition to public art, Blanco continues his life trajectory with collectible sculptures, his illustrious comic strip \\"The Castaway,\\" and furniture design. Blanco's technical mastery and flowing geometry has gained him international recognition. His artworks form part of sales in renown auction houses such as Sotheby's and Christie's. In 1971 Blanco graduated as an industrial designer from the prestigious Neumann Institute of Design in Caracas, Venezuela. Under the mentorship of European artists living as expatriates in Caracas, Blanco learned to integrate industrial design with creative processes. His instructors were predominantly artists, such as Gego and Cornelis Zitman, who emphasized artistry in their classrooms. Blanco graduated with a degree in industrial design upon the completion of his first furniture line for children, a thesis project that foregrounded much of his future artwork. Immediately after graduation Blanco began his career as a sculptor, freelance graphic designer and furniture designer. In the late 70s he studied at Rome's Academy of Fine Arts, where his geometric minimalism and interest in expressive and yet delicate lines was further enriched. During his stay in Europe Blanco also uncovered the world of cartoonists. This discovery led Blanco to create the most iconic comic strip in Venezuela's history, \\"The Castaway.\\" In 1980 \\"The Castaway\\" made its debut in El Diario de Caracas. The strip's main character, Castaway, rapidly became a beloved hallmark. Castaway was widely disseminated across the city; it enhanced the city's metro system even. Eight books have been published on Blanco's \\"The Castaway.\\" For over thirty years, these black and white vignettes have humored viewers, inviting them to contemplate nature and liberty. Through scenes that celebrate philosophical whimsy and human imagination, Blanco narrates heartfelt stories. As \\"The Castaway\\" continued to live its success, Blanco illustrated more than twenty storybooks for children and countless educational books. His accomplishments as illustrator led him to El Museo de los Ni√±os, where he served as Creative Director for twenty years. During Blanco's directorship at the Museum, his sculptural work evolved from darker expressions on political ideologies and existentialist absurdity into bright and energetic dialogs supporting newfound values. Love, music, dance, sports and humor motivate Blanco's widely known oeuvre. Throughout his career Blanco has designed purposefully. He seeks to engage his audience without requiring intellectual explanations to be understood. Combining geometric precision and figuration, he communicates effectively and immediately. Like the work of his primary influences, Klee, Mir√≥, Herbin and Calder, Blanco's presents his sculptures in primary colors. Purity of color and form tune the vibrancy of his compositions and resolve his sculptures with a personal kind of sophisticated simplicity. Blanco's largest body of work has been created and fabricated in the United States, where he lives and works since 1999. His esteemed artwork forms part of private collections all over the world and has received multiple accolades. Education Blanco began drawing and painting in 1967 and sculpting in the early 1970s, although he was interested in art from an early age. He received his formal training at the Neumann Institute in Caracas, Venezuela, which he attended with the aid of a scholarship. He graduated in 1971 with a degree in Industrial Design, after which he worked as a graphic designer. From 1975 to 1979, he lived in Rome, Italy, where he attended open classes at the Academy of Fine Arts. Career Blanco's first solo exhibition was in 1974, where he showed sculpture and drawings. A year later, he moved to Rome, Italy, where he continued to work in sculpture while making a living by doing freelance graphic design drawing cartoons for a variety of newspapers and magazines, including political cartoons for the newspaper L'Opinione.\\"L'Opinione, December 1978 It was during this period that he first conceived the idea of a comic strip. In 1978, Blanco participated in the Bordhigera Humor Salon, winning the Dattero D'Argento, and in the Monterotondo Sculpture Salon, where he was awarded the first prize for medium format sculpture. In 1979, Blanco returned to Caracas, Venezuela where he exhibited his sculptures and drawings at the Sof√≠a Imber Museum of Contemporary Art. Here, he continued working in sculpture but he also designed and illustrated a children's newspaper El Cohete. In 1980, he was hired as the Art Director for the Caracas Children's Museum (Art, Science and Technology, Museo de los Ni√±os) Maravillosarealidad.Com (1980‚Äì1998). He worked there for 18 years. That same year, Blanco created the comic strip The Castaway/El N√°ufrago, which became an overnight success. It was published in major newspapers and magazines in Venezuela and lead to significant sales in merchandising and books. The Castaway even crossed over to television. Due to the comic's success, Blanco no longer had time to work on his sculpture alongside his work as freelance graphic designer, illustrator, and his job at the museum, and reluctantly had to put sculpture aside. In 1989, Blanco returned to sculpture, and eventually left the Caracas Children's Museum to move to the United States, where he still lives today. Whereas his earlier work focused on more unconventional materials, his work now had a different approach, focused more on metals and bright colors. Blanco began exhibiting again in both Venezuela and the United States as well as around the world. In 1996, Blanco installed four sculptures in Tokyo, Japan, which launched his fascination with public art. Since 1999, Blanco has lived and worked on the West Coast of Florida, with a particular focus on public art. In 2005, Blanco became an American citizen. He currently resides in Sarasota, Florida. In 2007, Blanco received the John Ringling Visual Art Award. The Castaway (El Naufrago) The Castaway is a comic strip created by Blanco in 1980 about a man trapped on an island that was originally printed in the newspaper El Diario de Caracas. The strip was wildly popular, and images from it have graced the covers of notebooks, phone cards, and T-shirts.\\"El N√°ufrago\\" de Jorge Blanco, Libro 1, Prologo de Pedro Leon Zapata \\"The Castaway\\" was also published in the United States in The Observer a Sarasota-based weekly newspaper. Influences Blanco's early works were influenced by his teachers Gertrude Goldschmidt (Gego) and Cornelis Zitman and by the work of artists such as Auguste Herbin, Paul Klee and Joan Mir√≥. At this time, he worked with unconventional materials such as Lycra, rope, wood, mirrors, and bronze. Blanco's sculptures were and continue to be geometric studies, interpretations of his internal world. In 1992, Blanco began to explore color and metal as a primary material.

The show was criticized by the FCC, which considered it a half- hour commercial for toy cars. ABC contested the charge, saying that there was no prior commitment to Mattel, and that Hot Wheels cars were never advertised during the program.

In 1914 Robert Baden-Powell announced a Junior Section for Scouting. In 1916, he published his own outlines for such a scheme, to be called Wolf Cubbing. Baden-Powell may have had a number of reasons to call this section Wolf Cubs: Wolf was the name of the cannon made in the railway workshops at Mafeking. By analogy, a young boy not old enough to be a wolf or true Scout could be a baby wolf or Wolf Cub. Baden-Powell asked his friend Rudyard Kipling for the use of his Jungle Book history and universe as a motivational frame in cub scouting. Baden-Powell wrote a new book, The Wolf Cub's Handbook, for junior members. In 1917, junior members became known as Wolf Cubs. In the 1960s and later, the Wolf Cub section departed in many organizations from the jungle theme. Some changed their name to Cub Scout or something similar but retained the Jungle Stories and Cub ceremony as tradition‚Äîsuch as the use of Jungle Books names (as described below); and the Grand Howl which signals the start and end of the Cub Scout Meetings. Other organizations kept the name but changed the theme totally. Akela In Cub Scout packs, Akela is a symbol of wisdom, authority, and leadership. Akela is anyone who acts as a leader to the Scout. Akela can be a Cubmaster, Den Leader, parent or teacher depending on where the guidance takes place. In den meetings, it is the Den Leader who is Akela. During pack meetings it is the Cubmaster. At home, the parents fill this role.The Law of the Pack Sir Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scouting movement, chose Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book as a source of symbolism and allegorical framework for the youngest members of the Scouting movement.History of Cub Scouting Many references are made to this story in the Cub Scout section, including the \\"Council Rock\\" for discussions and planning, and the \\"Grand Howl\\" to express a sense of belonging and team spirit.Akela - MeritBadgeDotOrg Many Cub Scout packs use an oath called the \\"Law of the Pack\\" to show allegiance and demonstrate their relationship to Akela and the pack: :The Cub Scout follows Akela. :The Cub Scout helps the pack go. :The pack helps the Cub Scout grow. :The Cub Scout gives goodwill. In the United Kingdom, where nearly all of the links with The Jungle Book have been taken out of the Cub Scout programme, the names of Jungle Book characters are still used for Cub Scout Leaders. Akela is still reserved for the Leader of a Cub Pack, but is not universally in use (i.e., other character names can be held by the leader, usually to avoid confusion when there is a change of leadership). Rudyard Kipling obtained the name \\"Akela\\" from Hindi, meaning \\"alone.\\" References Akela Category:Scouting Scouting ","title":"The Jungle Book and Scouting"},{"id":"10406015","text":"Cr√®vec≈ìur-en-Brie () is a commune in the Seine-et-Marne department in the √éle- de-France region in north-central France.

He is the leader of the Seeonee pack of Indian wolves and presides over the pack's council meetings. It is at such a meeting that the pack adopts the lost child Mowgli and Akela becomes one of Mowgli's mentors. AkelƒÅ means \\"single or solitary\\" in Hindi.Oxford English Dictionary Kipling also calls him the Lone Wolf: Kipling portrays Akela with the character of an English gentleman. This is shown by his recurring references to the honour of the pack. He is large and grey and leads the pack by virtue of his strength and cunning. Character history Nine or ten years after Mowgli's adoption, his enemy Shere Khan the tiger, with the aid of some young wolves he has persuaded to support him, plans to depose Akela so that he will no longer be able to defend Mowgli. A wolf who becomes too old to hunt is traditionally driven out or killed by his pack. Akela is far from decrepit, but the young wolves deliberately drive a young, healthy buck deer toward him, knowing that he will not be able to catch it. When the council meets to depose Akela, Mowgli defends him with a blazing branch and drives Shere Khan and his allies away. The death of Akela after his battle with the dholes, as illustrated in page 280 of the 1895 edition of The Two Jungle Books by Rudyard Kipling After Shere Khan's departure the remaining wolves beg Akela to stay, but he refuses to remain pack leader and decides to hunt alone. Phao becomes the new pack leader, Mowgli returns to humanity, at least for a time, and Akela hunts alone. During this period Akela helps Mowgli to kill Shere Khan with the aid of the human village's water buffalo herd. Some years later, when Mowgli has been rejected by humanity and the pack is threatened with extinction by a rampaging pack of dholes, Akela joins the battle and fights to the death, finally dying in Mowgli's company (\\"Red Dog\\", in The Second Jungle Book). Akela did this for the love of Mowgli and his death is a major factor in Mowgli's decision to finally return to human society at the age of 17. Disney * In the animated 1967 Disney adaptation, Akela (voiced by John Abbott) only has a brief role at the beginning of the film, when the council of wolves meet after Shere Khan's return to the jungle to decide what to do about Mowgli's future. Acknowledging Shere Khan on their own, they decide to send Mowgli away, with Bagheera volunteering to take Mowgli back to the man- village. * A younger Akela appears in an episode of the prequel cartoon Jungle Cubs, looking at the animal characters in their youth (voiced by Rob Paulsen). In this episode, Akela and Leah (voiced by Kath Soucie) run away from their old wolf pack as the pack leader Cain (voiced by Jim Cummings) wants Leah for himself, forcing the two younger wolves to escape and retreat to the old temple that serves as the group's Cubhouse. Although Shere Khan initially objects to their presence when the rest of the pack arrives, the young cubs agree to help Akela and Leah, driving the rest of the pack away as Akela battles and defeats Cain. At the conclusion of the episode, Akela and Leah become the parents of a group of wolf cubs, with the other animals being appointed the cubs' godfathers. Despite their evident closeness to the other cubs in this episode, Akela and Leah never appeared again in the series. * Akela plays a bigger role in the live-action Disney movie Jungle Book: Mowgli's Story voiced by Clancy Brown. In this adaptation, he is also the father of Mowgli's adopted family and mate of Raksha. * In the 2016 live- action film, Giancarlo Esposito voices Akela. In an interview, Esposito describes his character as the wolf pack's fierce patriarch and as \\"strong and hardened\\" as well as \\"a great leader and wise teacher\\", welcoming of Mowgli into his pack, but at the same time, worried that Mowgli may compromise the pack's safety in the future. In the film, Akela adopts Mowgli into his pack after Bagheera rescues him. However, years later, Shere Khan threatens the wolf pack upon finding Mowgli at a gathering at the watering hole during a drought. This causes disagreement to break out on whether Mowgli should leave the pack, but Mowgli decides to leave to protect them before a decision is reached. Upon Shere Khan's return, Akela tells him that Mowgli has left. Shere Khan then kills Akela by throwing him off a cliff and assumes command of the wolf pack. Akela's death has far-reaching effects, spreading through the jungle until Mowgli hears of his murder from King Louie and decides to avenge him. Akela is finally avenged when Mowgli kills Shere Khan by causing him to fall into a pit of fire beneath a tree. Afterwards, Raksha takes Akela's place as the new leader of the pack. Other adaptations * Akela is also a major character in the Japanese-produced Jungle Book Sh≈çnen Mowgli. He was voiced by Yuzuru Fujimoto in the Japanese and Walter Massey in the English dub. Akela is the leader of the wolf pack but, as he is growing old, he agrees to pass the leadership onto a worthy successor. When Alexander beats Vermillion in a contest, Akela passes the leadership onto Alexander while Vermillion leaves the pack. However, after Alexander's death, Akela takes back the role of the leader. Briefly, during the series, Vermillion returns to take the leadership of the pack but later leaves to lead another wolf pack on the plains. Therefore, Akela assumes the leadership of the pack once more. But since he had become too feeble and old to be an active leader, he stayed in his lair for most of his day. Subsequently, Luri takes over the leadership of the pack from Akela but he stays on as an adviser and is given the title of \\"The Wise Old Wolf\\". At the very end of the series, Akela gets severely injured in a battle against a pack of jackals and, although he manages to recover from the wounds, he is severely weakened from the fight and soon dies. * In Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle, Akela is voiced by Peter Mullan. He and his pack adopt Mowgli and keep him safe from Shere Khan and Tabaqui. Shere Khan states to Akela that he will return to claim his territory the day when Akela misses his prey. Years later, this happens when Akela fails to catch a deer. When Shere Khan and Tabaqui arrive, they get some of the wolves on their side and Akela is challenged. Mowgli uses fire to drive them away, but shames himself in the eyes of Akela, who regretfully tells Mowgli to leave the pack immediately. Shere Khan and his minions quickly drive Akela and his supporters to the edge of the jungle. When Mowgli seeks their help in defeating Shere Khan, Akela refuses, as it would break the jungle law. However, during the duel between Shere Khan and Mowgli outside the man village, Akela has a change of heart and saves Mowgli from the tiger, but in doing takes the bullet the hunter John Lockwood meant for Shere Khan. Before he dies, Akela apologizes for abandoning Mowgli and gives the boy his blessing to lead the jungle's creatures and the wolf pack. * In the Soviet animated series Adventures of Mowgli he is voiced by Lev Lubetsky and Yuri Puzyryov. In the joint Russian-American production of 1996 for the English-speaking audience he is voiced by David Kaye. Influence Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of scouting, based aspects of Cub Scouting on Rudyard Kipling's Mowgli Stories. In Cub Scouting, the terms \\"Law of the Pack,\\" \\"Akela\\" (the leader of a group), \\"Wolf Cub\\", \\"Grand Howl\\", \\"den,\\" and \\"pack\\" all refer to Kipling's work.

He was one of the original founders and financiers of the Nigerian People's Party, but in 1978 left the party to form the Great Nigeria People's Party (GNPP). As a candidate of the GNPP, he won almost 10% of the national vote in the Nigerian presidential elections of 1979.Election Results Archive, Center on Democratic Performance, State University of New York Binghamton. Political Handbook of the World 1980, Binghamton, NY: CSA Publications, 1980.  Early life  Ibrahim was born on February 26, 1926 in Yerwa, Maiduguri. His father, Baba Alhaji Ibrahim Ibn Mohammed was an Islamic scholar; he named the new born after a friend who was then Waziri of Borno.Anyaegbunam, N. (1992). Waziri Ibrahim: Politics without bitterness. Lagos, Nigeria: Daily Times of Nigeria.,p37 Waziri's early childhood was in Damaturu where his father was the Imam of a local mosque. He attended Damaturu Elementary School (1936-1939), followed by studies at Maiduguri Middle School (1940-1943) and then Kaduna College, 1944-1947. At Kaduna College, he was classmates with Prof Umaru Shehu; before completing his studies, it was the desire of the then Chief Education Officer of Borno, Kashim Ibrahim that Waziri should enter the teaching service after graduation. However, Waziri did not go further in training after Kaduna College nor did he teach, instead he chose to work with U.A.C. as a trainee manager in 1948. At the firm, he climbed clerical and administrative ranks from acting as a cashier and storekeeper at U.A.C.'s, Maiduguri branch in 1951. He then worked at Jos in 1952 before becoming a labour and staff manager for Benue division in 1953. By the time he left the firm, he was district manager of Kaduna. Political and Business career In politics, Waziri was initially a member of NEPU, he organized the Damaturu branch of the association in 1950 and was the branch chairman in 1951. However, towards the end of the 1950s, Waziri joined NPC and was appointed the Federal Minister of Health in 1958. In 1960, he was part of the Nigerian delegation to the United Nation's when the country was accepted as the 99th member of the organization. In 1962, as minister of Economic Development, he presented to the parliament an ambitious capital expenditure budget over a six-year span based on a 4% annual growth in GDP and investment of resources in productive projects to foster development. Among the major planks of the budget, was the development of the Kainji Dam. However, close to half of the capital expenditure's revenue were to be obtained through foreign aid. In 1962, Nigeria conducted a controversial census that was rejected by political leaders from the Eastern and Western region, the office of the census officer was under Waziri's ministry. Accusations of over counting were thrown around on all sides with Waziri accusing the Eastern region of inflating population figures while the southern leaders labeled the Northern head count as over-inflated. The controversy generated by the head count led the cancellation of the census results and official figures were never publicly acknowledged. After the military coup of 1966, he went into private business. During the Nigerian Civil War, he was involved in arms dealing and consultancy and afterwards, he established a defense consultancy firm. Waziri established a group of companies under the corporate name Herwa which included a tin mining venture in Jos and a soap and flour mill in Maiduguri. He opened a 5 million naira Herwa clinic in Kano. He entered the fishing industry after buying out Stephen Tolbert's fishing concern and in addition, imported frozen fish under the corporate name Nigeria Cold Stores.Forrest, T. (1994). The advance of African capital: The growth of Nigerian private enterprise. Charlottesville: Univ. Press of Virginiap260. In 1978, Waziri joined politics again, he co-founded the NPP with members of Club 19 and Council for National Unity, however a disagreement arose between Waziri and some party members who were largely disciples of Azikiwe such Adeniran Ogunsanya. Leaders of Club 19 and Council for National Unity opposed Ibrahim's ambition of becoming both the party's chairman and its presidential candidate. The conflict deepened after the party's first convention in 1978 and subsequently led to his exit from the party. He then formed the Great Nigeria People's Party.Falola, T., & Genova, A. (2009). Historical dictionary of Nigeria. Lanham, Md: Scarecrow Press. p160 He was an unsuccessful presidential candidate in the 1979 election, but was popular in its Kanuri base. His party won the gubernatorial election in Borno where the Kanuri are majority and also nearby Gongola state. Personal life Waziri's first marriage was to a Shuwa Arab lady, Fatime, he later married two other Wives, the last being Fatimah, daughter of Kashim Ibrahim. He was the father of Khadija Bukar Abba Ibrahim. ReferencesFurther reading *Paul Mamza. [Nigeria‚Äôs unsung heroes (7): POLITICS WITHOUT BITTERNESS: CAPTURING THE MESSAGE OF ALHAJI WAZIRI IBRAHIM].

The Gortyn code (also called the Great CodeI. Cret. IV.72) was a legal code that was the codification of the civil law of the ancient Greek city-state of Gortyn in southern Crete.  History  Our sole source of knowledge of the code is the fragmentary boustrophedon inscriptionThe terms \\"Gortyn code\\" and \\"Great Code\\" may be used interchangeably for the text and the inscription. on the circular walls of what might have been a bouleuterion or other public civic building in the agora of Gortyn. The original building was in diameter; the 12 columns of text which survive are in length and in height and contain some 600 lines of text. In addition, some further broken texts survive; the so-called second text.I. Cret. IV 41-50 It is the longest extant ancient Greek inscription except for the inscription of Diogenes of Oenoanda. Evidence suggests it is the work of a single sculptor. The inscription has been dated to the first half of the 5th century BCE.Willets 1967, p. 8 The first fragment of the code was discovered in the 1850s. Italian archaeologist Federico Halbherr found a further four columns of the text while excavating a site near a local mill in 1884. Since this was evidently part of a larger text, he, with Ernst Fabricius and a team, obtained permission to excavate the rest of the site, revealing 8 more text columns whose stones had been reused as part of the foundations of a Roman Odeion from the 1st century BCE. The wall bearing the code has now been partially reconstructed. The Great Code is written in the Dorian dialect and is one of a number of legal inscriptions found scattered across Crete but curiously, very few nonlegal texts from ancient Crete survive.See J. Whitley The Archaeology of Ancient Greece p. 248 for a statistical analysis. The Dorian language was then pervasive among Cretan cities such as Knossos, Lyttos, Axos and various other areas of central Crete.see Willetts, \\"The Law Code of Gortyn\\" The Code stands with a tradition of Cretan law, which taken as a totality represents the only substantial corpus of Greek law from antiquity found outside Athens. The whole corpus of Cretan law may be divided into three broad categories: the earliest (I. Cret. IV 1-40., ca. 600 BCE to ca. 525 BCE) was inscribed on the steps and walls of the temple of Apollo Pythios, the next a sequence, including the Great Code, written on the walls in or near the agora between ca. 525 and 400 BCE (I. Cret. IV 41-140), followed by the laws (I. Cret. IV 141-159), which contain Ionian characters and so are dated to the 4th century. Though all the texts are fragmentary and show evidence of a continuous amendment of the law,See J. Davies:Deconstructing Gortyn: When is a CODE a Code?, in Greek Law in its Political Setting L Foxhall, ADE Lewis (eds). it has been possible to trace the development of the law from Archaic proscriptions onwards, notably the diminishing rights of women and the increasing rights of slaves. Also, one can infer some aspects of public law. Content The code deals with such matters as disputed ownership of slaves, rape and adultery, the rights of a wife when divorced or a widow, the custody of children born after divorce, inheritance, sale and mortgaging of property, ransom, children of mixed (slave, free and foreign) marriages and adoption.For a full discussion of the text see John Davies: The Gortyn Laws in The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Greek Law, pp. 305-327. The code makes legal distinctions between different social classes. Free, serf, slave and foreigner social statuses are recognized within the document. =Bringing suit= The code provides a measure of protection for individuals prior to their trial. Persons bringing suit are prohibited from seizing and detaining the accused before trial. Violations are punishable by fines, which vary depending on the status of the detained individual. =Rape and adultery= Rape under the code is punished with fines. The fine is largely determined by the difference in social status between the victim and the accused. A free man convicted of raping a serf or a slave would receive the lowest fine; a slave convicted of raping a free man or woman would warrant the highest fine. Adultery is punished similarly to rape under the code but also takes into consideration the location of the crime. The code dictates higher fines for adultery committed within the household of the female's father, husband or brother, as opposed to another location. Fines also depend on whether the woman has previously committed adultery. The fines are levied against the male involved in the adultery, not the female. The code does not provide for the punishment of the female. =Divorce and marriage rights= The Gortyn law code grants a modicum of property rights to women in the case of divorce. Divorced women are entitled to any property that they brought to the marriage and half of the joint income if derived from her property. The code also provides for a portion of the household property. The code stipulates that any children conceived before the divorce but born after the divorce fall under the custody of the father. If the father does not accept the child, it reverts to the mother. =Property rights and inheritance= The code devotes a great deal of attention to the allocation and management of property. Although the husband manages the majority of the family property, the wife's property is still delineated. If the wife dies, the husband becomes the trustee to her property and may take no action on it without the consent of her children. In the case of remarriage, the first wife's property immediately comes into her children's possession. If the wife dies childless, her property reverts to her blood relatives. If the husband dies with children, the property is held in trust by the wife for the children. If the children are of age upon their father's death, the property is divided between the children, with males receiving all of the land. If the husband dies without any children, the wife is compelled to remarry. Adopted children receive all the inheritance rights of natural children and are considered legitimate heirs in all cases. Women are not allowed to adopt children. Gallery Image:Œ°œâŒºŒ±œäŒ∫œå Œ©Œ¥ŒµŒØŒø ŒìœåœÅœÑœÖŒΩŒ±œÇ 1848.jpgThe Amphitheatre containing the Gortyn code.

University of Chicago Press, p. 320 Dewar married Edith, daughter of Alfred Rawles on 7 March 1902 at Bombay. He was posted Accountant General in Punjab from 1921 to 1924. Dewar however wrote most on ornithology and wrote numerous books on the birds of India. He particularly favoured the study of birds in life in the field wrote in his Birds of the Plains: :\\"The ornithological world is peopled by two classes of human beings. There are those who study nature inside the museum with the microscope and scalpel and there are those who live to observe birds In the open and study their habits.\\" He accuses the museum ornithologists of needlessly multiplying new species and altering names, too much attention being paid to local variations.New York Times review January 23, 1909, Saturday online In his early education, he had been taught the ideas of evolution and was half-hearted in his acceptance of the principles. Although his early works on ornithology seemed to accept ideas of adaptation and selection, he later became a creationist and published a number of books and debates attacking evolution, and was the founding secretary-treasurer in the Evolution Protest Movement in 1932 along with Bernard Acworth and Lewis Merson Davies,http://dannyreviews.com/h/Creationists.html jointly known as the Acworth Circle. He leaned towards the idea of old earth creationism but questioned radiometric dating. His book, The Transformist Illusion published posthumously in 1957 attempted to show the failure of evolution using examples such as the infinitesimal probability of proteins arising out of random mixing, the fossil record, bird anatomy, blood group incompatibilities, and queried evolutionary claims in embryology and vestigial organs. Reviewers pointed out the problems in his objections.Review by D.S.

It was founded by former members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood after the original PRB had been dissolved. It was envisaged that the club would provide an alternative meeting space and exhibition venue to overcome prejudice against the Pre-Raphaelites at the Royal Academy. Unlike the PRB, the Hogarth Club was established on a professional basis, with two classes of members, artistic and non-artistic, and a distinction between London-based \\"resident\\" and provincial \\"non-resident\\" members.

Brown and Dante Gabriel Rossetti had worked on some previous independent exhibitions, but became determined to form a permanent exhibition space after the rejection of Pre-Raphaelite work by the Academy in 1857. In response they created their own exhibition, later founding the Hogarth Club in tandem with other sympathetic artists, most notably William Holman Hunt and John Roddam Spencer Stanhope.Cherry, D., The Hogarth Club: 1858-1861, The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 122, No. 925 (April 1980), pp. 236‚Äì244.

She was born at Quetta in India, a descendant of Edmund Plowden and, collaterally, of Henry Chichele. Privately educated, she worked for the BBC as a script editor. She wrote the script for the television series Mistress of Hardwick (about Bess of Hardwick), which won her a Writers' Guild Award for the best educational television series, and several television plays, including Sweet England's Pride, and The Case of Eliza Armstrong. She later recalled: \\"A secretary writing scripts was a little like a performing monkey at the BBC - there was a sort of 'Fancy, what a clever little girl' attitude.\\" In 1970 she decided to leave the BBC to go freelance. Her first book, ‚ÄòThe Young Elizabeth‚Äô (1972), was followed by ‚ÄòDanger to Elizabeth‚Äô (1973), ‚ÄòMarriage With My Kingdom‚Äô (1977), about Elizabeth's courtships, and ‚ÄòElizabeth Regina‚Äô (1980), which presented the Queen at the height of her powers. Collectively these books became known as Alison Plowden's \\"Elizabethan Quartet\\". While working on this series she also published ‚ÄòTudor Women‚Äô (1979). After the quartet she wrote ‚ÄòElizabethan England: life in an age of adventure‚Äô (1982). In addition she wrote many drama and other scripts for BBC radio between 1963 and 1988. Later she turned her attention to the 19th century with ‚ÄòThe Young Victoria‚Äô (1983) and ‚ÄòCaroline and Charlotte‚Äô (1989), then the Civil War period with ‚ÄòThe Stuart Princesses‚Äô (1996), about the six princesses of the House of Stuart who lived through the violent upheavals of the 17th century. This was followed by ‚ÄòWomen All on Fire‚Äô (1998), about the activities of women on both sides of the Civil War. One of these women was Queen Henrietta Maria, of whom she published a biography in 2001. She continued with ‚ÄòIn a Free Republic - life in Cromwell's England‚Äô (2006) and the last of her 25 books ‚ÄòThe Winter Queen‚Äô (about Elizabeth Stuart, wife of Frederick V, Elector Palatine who accepted the crown of Bohemia), to be published posthumously in 2008. She was devoted to animal welfare, and shared her home with two cats. She was unmarried.

Formally titled the Congested Districts (Scotland) Commissioners, the Board consisted of the Secretary for Scotland, the Under- Secretary for Scotland, the Chairman (or Convenor) of the Local Government Board for Scotland, the Chairman of the Fishery Board for Scotland, the Chairman of the Crofters' Commission, and up to three other people nominated by the Secretary for ScotlandCongested Districts (Scotland) Act, 1897, section 1 The main aims of the Board were to aid and develop agriculture (for instance, by distributing seed potatoes and seed oats, and supplying stud animals); the fishing industry (for instance, by improving lighthouses, piers and harbours); and home industries such as spinning and weaving. It was also intended to improve roads and bridges, and aid the migration of crofters to other parts of Scotland. The Board was modeled on the Congested Districts Board for Ireland (the CDB), which had been officially established by The Rt Hon. Arthur Balfour, P.C., M.P., who was then serving as the Chief Secretary for Ireland. An example of their work was the construction of a small jetty and slip on Hirta, St Kilda, between 1899 and 1901. Though this project had been discussed by the Board of Trade, the Admiralty and the owner (Macleod of Macleod) for many years, it was only really the petition of the community and their minister and the creation of the CDB that prompted action. The project was undertaken by Scottish Office engineers with St Kildan labour, but fully funded and administered by the CDB. The Board was abolished by section 28 of the Small Landholders (Scotland) Act 1911, and its powers and duties transferred to the Board of Agriculture for Scotland established by section 4 of that Act.Small Landholders (Scotland) Act 1911, sections 4 and 28. Most of the 1897 Act however remains in force, with the functions now in the hands of the Scottish Ministers.

This can be in the form of sphere of lipid molecules (micelles), pairs of layers that face one another (lamellar phase, observed in biological systems as a lipid bilayer), a tubular arrangement (hexagonal), or various cubic phases (Fdm, Imm, Iam, Pnm, and Pmm being those discovered so far). More complicated aggregations have also been observed, such as rhombohedral, tetragonal and orthorhombic phases. It forms an important part of current academic research in the fields of membrane biophysics (polymorphism), biochemistry (biological impact) and organic chemistry (synthesis). Determination of the topology of a lipid system is possible by a number of methods, the most reliable of which is x-ray diffraction. This uses a beam of x-rays that are scattered by the sample, giving a diffraction pattern as a set of rings. The ratio of the distances of these rings from the central point indicates which phase(s) are present. The structural phase of the aggregation is influenced by the ratio of lipids present, temperature, hydration, pressure and ionic strength (and type). Hexagonal phases In lipid polymorphism, if the packing ratio of lipids is greater or less than one, lipid membranes can form two separate hexagonal phases, or nonlamellar phases, in which long, tubular aggregates form according to the environment in which the lipid is introduced. =Hexagonal I phase (HI)= This phase is favored in detergent-in-water solutions and has a packing ratio of less than one. The micellar population in a detergent/water mixture cannot increase without limit as the detergent to water ratio increases. In the presence of low amounts of water, lipids that would normally form micelles will form larger aggregates in the form of micellar tubules in order to satisfy the requirements of the hydrophobic effect. These aggregates can be thought of as micelles that are fused together. These tubes have the polar head groups facing out, and the hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains facing the interior. This phase is only seen under unique, specialized conditions, and most likely is not relevant for biological membranes. =Hexagonal II phase (HII)= Lipid molecules in the HII phase pack inversely to the packing observed in the hexagonal I phase described above. This phase has the polar head groups on the inside and the hydrophobic, hydrocarbon tails on the outside in solution. The packing ratio for this phase is larger than oneStuart, Marc & Boekema, Egbert. (2007). Two distinct mechanisms of vesicle-to-micelle and micelle-to-vesicle transition are mediated by the packing parameter of phospholipid‚Äìdetergent systems, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6124701_Two_distinct_mechanisms_of_vesicle- to-micelle_and_micelle-to- vesicle_transition_are_mediated_by_the_packing_parameter_of_phospholipid- detergent_systems#pf9, which is synonymous with an inverse cone packing. Extended arrays of long tubes will form (as in the hexagonal I phase), but because of the way the polar head groups pack, the tubes take the shape of aqueous channels. These arrays can stack together like pipes. This way of packing may leave a finite hydrophobic surface in contact with water on the outside of the array. However, the otherwise energetically favorable packing apparently stabilizes this phase as a whole. It is also possible that an outer monolayer of lipid coats the surface of the collection of tubes to protect the hydrophobic surface from interaction with the aqueous phase. It is suggested that this phase is formed by lipids in solution in order to compensate for the hydrophobic effect. The tight packing of the lipid head groups reduces their contact with the aqueous phase. This, in turn, reduces the amount of ordered, but unbound water molecules. The most common lipids that form this phase include phospatidylethanolamine (PE), when it has unsaturated hydrocarbon chains. Diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG, otherwise known as cardiolipin) in the presence of calcium is also capable of forming this phase. =Techniques for detection= There are several techniques used to map out which phase is present during perturbations done on the lipid. These perturbations include pH changes, temperature changes, pressure changes, volume changes, etc. The most common technique used to study phospholipid phase presence is phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR). In this technique, different and unique powder diffraction patterns are observed for lamellar, hexagonal, and isotropic phases. Other techniques that are used and do offer definitive evidence of existence of lamellar and hexagonal phases include freeze-fracture electron microscopy, X-Ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance (2H NMR).

Additionally, negative staining transmission electron microscopy has been shown as a useful tool to study lipid bilayer phase behavior and polymorphism into lamellar phase, micellar, unilamellar liposome, and hexagonal aqueous-lipid structures, in aqueous dispersions of membrane lipids.YashRoy R.C. (1994) Destabilisation of lamellar dispersion of thylakoid membrane lipids by sucrose.

As a young man, he was politically active in the Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League, where he was elected into the Central Committee in 1926, and eventually became an editor of its publications. Later he became the chairman of the Council of Mongolian Trade Unions and was involved in the collectivization and seizures. He joined the MPRP in 1932. In 1933 he continued his education in Leningrad. After returning to Mongolia in 1938, Damdins√ºren became an ally of Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, the future Premier Minister and President. He promoted the switch from the vertically written classical Mongolian script to an adapted Cyrillic script. He was forced to do it as he was politically repressed and imprisoned and was threatened by capital punishment. Later he confessed abandonment of the Classical Mongolian Script as one of the mistakes of his life. Between 1942 and 1946 he was an editor for the party newspaper √únen (The Truth).

He also produced prose and literary studies, and a translation of The Secret History of the Mongols into modern Mongolian. The language of his poems and prose were largely based on the oral literary traditions of Mongolia, which he developed into a classical language of the Mongolian literature of the 20th century. His novel Gologdson Kh√º√ºkhen (, The Rejected Girl) became one of the popular films of the 1960s.

Biography Emilia was born in Cologne. She is named after Amalia of Neuenahr who was in charge of her mother's household at the time of her birth. Emilia's mother had an affair with the father of painter Peter Paul Rubens. Due to this infidelity Emilia and her siblings, Anna and Maurice, were taken out of their mother's care and went to live with their uncle John VI, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg at Dillenburg. Emilia later went to live in Delft with her father and, in Friesland, with her sister, Anna. Emilia of Nassau After her father's death she acted as hostess at the court of her brother, Maurice. It was on one of those occasions that she met Dom Manuel de Portugal, (son of pretender to the Portuguese throne, Ant√≥nio, Prior of Crato). She secretly wed him in 1597. Maurice was firmly opposed to the marriage, because the Nassaus were Calvinists and Dom Manuel was a Catholic. Maurice put Emilia under house arrest; Dom Manuel had to flee to Wesel. When Maurice found he could not convince her to divorce her husband, he banished her from court for ten years. They eventually made peace and she and Dom Manuel were at Maurice's deathbed. Emilia and her husband had ten children. The last years of their lives, they lived separately when her husband decided -- due to financial concerns -- to live in Brussels at the court of Isabella of Spain, archenemy of the House of Orange. Emilia went to Geneva with her daughters, where she died three years later, at the age of 59.

Plot introduction  When a beautiful starlet makes a monkey of him during a publicity stunt, L.A. lifeguard Eddie Baker loses more than face; his dreams of a leisurely lifetime on the beach evaporate. In pursuit of compensation from the starlet, Eddie takes a page from the blackmailer's book but very soon finds himself in deeper trouble than he ever could have imagined.  Plot summary  Shapely starlet Nola Norton finds a gimmick to get the attention of a major Hollywood studio. At a beautiful Southern California beach she pretends to be drowning and lures lifeguard Eddie Baker into deep water. In circumstances that completely disorient Eddie, Nola uses a concealed underwater breathing device, constructed for her by Eddie's supervisor, to hold Eddie underwater until he passes out. She then contrives to rescue him, which gains her the press she's been seeking, but effectively costs Eddie his career. When Eddie learns that his rescuer has landed a $150,000 studio contract on the strength of the publicity he unwittingly helped her gain, he determines to claim a share of the money for himself. He uncovers the connection between Nola and his supervisor, Hank Sawyer, now dead under mysterious circumstances. He determines that Nola and her sleazy theatrical agent, Joe Lamb, murdered Hank not only because of his complicity in the lucrative publicity stunt, but also because of what he knew about Nola's past as a teen-age prostitute in San Diego‚Äîthe kiss of death for an aspiring Hollywood star. Armed with this information‚Äî and enough material evidence to hang Nola in both the criminal justice system and the court of public opinion‚ÄîHank offers Nola a \\"business proposition\\" which falls little short of blackmail. Varied games of cat-and- mouse ensue, in which Nola unsuccessfully uses her charms to neutralize Eddie's assault on her income. Meanwhile, Joe Lamb convinces his vivacious, red-headed associate Carol Taylor to become involved in tracking Eddie to his desert hiding place. There Eddie and Carol become more than just friends. When Joe accompanies Carol to her next rendezvous with Eddie, he pulls a gun and takes steps to put Eddie out of the way, as he and Nola did with Hank Sawyer. Surprised and horrified, Carol steps in on Eddie's behalf and accidentally shoots and kills Joe. Eddie takes extraordinary risks to dispose of Joe's body in a way that will not implicate himself or the distraught Carol. While this seems to put the police off the scent, back in Los Angeles Nola puts the pieces together and threatens to expose Eddie as Joe's murderer. With the stakes this high, a showdown is inevitable. Eddie tracks Nola and her movie- star beau to a yacht off the shores of Catalina Island, where once more murder hangs in the night air. Eddie finds Nola a formidable adversary to the end, as the novel comes to its explosive conclusion.

Aerosolization refers to a process of intentionally oxidatively converting and suspending particles or a composition in a moving stream of air for the purpose of delivering the oxidized particles or composition to a particular location. The term is often used in medicine to refer specifically to the production of airborne particles (e.g. tiny liquid droplets) containing infectious virus or bacteria. The infectious organism is said to be aerosolized. This can occur when an infected individual coughs, sneezes exhales, or vomits, but can also arise from flushing a toilet, or disturbing dried contaminated feces. Aerosolization becomes critical in cases of Coronavirus and Pneumonic plague because of the high lethality of these diseases and human-to-human transmission disease vector. Treatment of some respiratory diseases relies on aerosolization of a liquid medication using a nebulizer, which is then breathed in for direct transport to the lungs. In the context of chemical and biological weapons, aerosolization is a means of dispersing a chemical or biological agent in an attack. See for example \\"Botulinum Toxin as a Biological Weapon\\".  Aerosolization and dustiness  Dustiness is defined as the tendency of a powder material to generate airborne particles under a given external energy input. This property of powdered materials has a close link with powder aerosolization processes. It also has indications on human exposure level and associated health risks at workplaces. Dusty materials tend to produce aerosols with high number concentrations, which poses higher exposure risks to the workers who are in direct contacts with them during industrial production and handling processes. Laboratory simulations have been established to test aerosolization behavior and dustiness level of powders, in order to predict aerosol properties encountered in real-life situations.

It is celebrated every year on the March equinox, on (or near) March 20. On World Storytelling Day, as many people as possible tell and listen to stories in as many languages and at as many places as possible, during the same day and night. Participants tell each other about their events in order to share stories and inspiration, to learn from each other and create international contacts. The significance in the event lies in the fact that it is the first global celebration of storytelling of its kind, and has been important in forging links between storytellers often working far apart from each other. It has also been significant in drawing public and media attention to storytelling as an art form.  Event History  World Storytelling Day has its roots in a national day for storytelling in Sweden, circa 1991-2. At that time, an event was organized for March 20 in Sweden called \\"Alla ber√§ttares dag\\" (All storytellers day). The Swedish national storytelling network passed out some time after, but the day stayed alive, celebrated around the country by different enthusiasts. In 1997, storytellers in Perth, Western Australia coordinated a five-week-long Celebration of Story, commemorating March 20 as the International Day of Oral Narrators. At the same time, in Mexico and other Latin American countries, March 20 was already celebrated as the National Day of Storytellers. When the Scandinavian storytelling web-network, Ratatosk, started around 2001, Scandinavian storytellers started talking, and in 2002, the event spread from Sweden to Norway, Denmark, Finland and Estonia. In 2003, the idea spread to Canada and other countries, and the event has become known internationally as World Storytelling Day. Starting around 2004, France participated with the event Jour Mondial du Conte. World Storytelling Day 2005 had a grande finale on Sunday March 20. There were events from 25 countries on 5 continents, and 2006 saw the program grow further. 2007 was the first time a storytelling concert was held in Newfoundland, Canada. In 2008 The Netherlands took part in World Storytelling Day with a big event called 'Vertellers in de Aanval' on March the 20th; three thousand kids were surprised by the sudden appearance of storytellers in their classrooms. In 2009, there were World Storytelling Day events in Europe, Asia, Africa, North America, South America and Australia.  Themes  thumb Each year, many of the individual storytelling events that take place around the globe are linked by a common theme. Each year, the theme is identified by and agreed upon by storytellers from around the world using the WSD listserve and Facebook group. * 2004 - Birds * 2005 - Bridges * 2006 - The Moon * 2007 - The Wanderer * 2008 - Dreams * 2009 - Neighbours * 2010 - Light and Shadow * 2011 - Water * 2012 - Trees * 2013 - Fortune and Fate * 2014 - Monsters and Dragons * 2015 - Wishes * 2016 - Strong Women * 2017 - Transformation * 2018 - Wise Fools * 2019 - Myths, Legends, and Epics * 2020 - Voyages  See also  * Storytelling * Storytelling festival * World Book Day * International Children's Book Day * Kamishibai  External links  * Official World Storytelling Day Facebook Group Announcements, events listings, discussion. * Official World Storytelling Day Website Information on hosting WSD events * World Storytelling Day 2007 - Archived open source audio recording in downloadable and streaming formats. * French Storytelling Day site * French Storytelling Day YouTube channel * French Storytelling Day MySpace page * German Storytelling Day site * site Vertel eens : Netherlands storytelling magazine, with articles and pictures of World Storytelling Day * Dutch Storytelling Day site Category:Art festivals Category:Storytelling festivals Category:March observances Category:International observances Category:International festivals ","title":"World Storytelling Day"},{"id":"10406330","text":"Andr√© Riedl (born October 10, 1940) is a politician from Quebec, Canada.

Bullough (21 November 1929 ‚Äì 30 August 2008) was a British mathematical physicist known for his contributions to the theory of solitons, in particular for his role in the development of the theory of the optical soliton, now commonly used, for example, in the theory of trans-oceanic optical fibre communication theory, but first recognised in Bullough's work on ultra-short (nano- and femto-second) optical pulses. He is also known for deriving exact solutions to the nonlinear equations describing these solitons and for associated work on integrable systems, infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems (both classical and quantum), and the statistical mechanics for these systems. Bullough also contributed to nonlinear mathematical physics, including Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensation in magnetic traps. Bullough obtained his first academic position in the Mathematics Department at UMIST in 1960 and was appointed chair of Mathematical Physics in 1973 where he remained until his retirement in 1995. He was then an Emeritus Professor in the same department, which has now become the School of Mathematics in the University of Manchester. Education and career Bullough's father, William Bullough, was a teacher of German in Newcastle-under-Lyme and was himself a graduate of the Victoria University of Manchester. His mother Edith (n√©e Norman) was also a teacher and both parents were Quakers. Although universally known as Robin, he was actually christened Robert Keith Bullough. Both Robin and his elder brother Donald attended Newcastle High School (then a direct grant grammar school). Donald went on to become a successful professor of medieval history.Julia Smith, Obituary Professor Donald Bullough, Medieval historian with a sideline in philately, The Independent, 6 July 2002, On leaving school at 16, Bullough obtained a scholarship to Emmanuel College, Cambridge but had to do National Service in the RAF in 1948 and 1949. Three days before his demobilisation he had an accident, putting a rawl plug into a wall, as a piece of steel from a chisel flew into his left eye. He was practically blind in that eye from then on. He obtained a BA in Natural Sciences at Cambridge, specialising in Theoretical Physics for part II. He went on to obtain a PhD in Chemistry from the University of Leeds in 1957. He then obtained a job as a Mathematical Physicist at the British Rayon Research Association in Manchester between 1959 and 1960 before obtaining a post as lecturer at UMIST. Bullough travelled widely to facilitate collaboration, with regular visiting appointments and research visits to Copenhagen, Jyv√§skyl√§, Los Alamos, DTH Lyngby in Denmark, and Ben Gurion University in Israel. He was promoted to Reader in 1967 and Professor of Mathematical Physics in 1973. He organised many conferences over his career including the first National Quantum Electronics Conferences (QEP1) in Manchester in September 1973 and at which he made a first report of 'optical solitons', this was the first of fifteen biennial meetings. By 1973 his research group in UMIST had found solutions to the sine-Gordon and the self-induced transparency (SIT) equations for their multi-soliton solutions and gone on to both introduce, and to solve the initial value problem for, the system they called the ‚ÄòReduced Maxwell- Bloch (RMB) Equations‚Äô.Gibbon J. D., Caudrey P. J., Bullough R. K. and Eilbeck J. C., \\"An N-Soliton Solution of a Nonlinear Optics Equation Derived by a General Inverse Method\\", Lett. al Nuovo Cimento 8, 1973, 775‚Äì779. Bullough supervised 24 successful doctoral students and had some 33 post doctoral research associates and visiting fellows. In 1999 he gave the specially invited 'Special Foundation Lecture' at the Fourteenth UK National Quantum Electronics & Photonics Conference (QEP14)R. K. Bullough, The optical solitons of QE1 are the BEC of QE14: has the quantum soliton arrived? Special Foundation Lecture: a personal view 14th National Quantum Electronics and Photonics Conference, Owens Park, University of Manchester, 8 September 1999, Journal of Modern Optics, vol. 47, Issue 11, p.2029-2065, held at the University of Manchester. The lecture was entitled \\"The optical soliton of QE1 is the BEC of QE14: has the quantum soliton arrived?\\" paid tribute to his 45 years work in this area. This work in theoretical quantum optics includes the discovery of the \\"optical soliton\\" as such around 1973. Only Steven Chu, Nobel Laureate 1997, was similarly honoured at this conference. Bullough died on 30 August 2008. A symposium was organinsed in his honour in the Alan Turing Building in June 2009.

The building was constructed in the center of Omaha's North Side in the Prairie School architecture style. Prairie School architecture is rare, and this architectural gem in urban Nebraska is particularly unusual for being designed and built in the 1920s, after the Prairie Style's rapid loss of popularity beginning after 1914. About Organized in the fall of 1865, the first minister of St. John was Rev. W. T. Osborne, who was also the first African American minister in Nebraska. The first meetings being held at a private residence on Capitol Avenue and Ninth Street in present-day downtown Omaha. After worshiping for a short time on Harney Street, the church moved to Douglas and Fifteenth Streets until the summer of 1865. That year a lot was purchased on the corner of Eighteenth and Webster Streets in Near North Omaha. The original church was built for $1,000.(n.d.)

Lee. Architecture St. John's has been housed in three different churches. The second church was located at North 25th and Grant Streets, and was notably designed by Omaha's first African American architect, Clarence W. Wigington, which was built around the turn of the century. When the congregation outgrew that building, they located a new place to build at 2402 North 22nd Street, St. John A.M.E. Church building was designed by local architect Frederick S. Stott in 1921 in the Prairie School style. In 1947 an auditorium was added, and additional rooms were finished in 1956. The building is remarkable for its reflection of the progressive attitude of its congregation at a time when traditional values in religious architecture were prevalent. The building is recognized as an important contribution to the Prairie School style, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in May 1980.  Notable members  St. John's has been host to several members who are notable in local and national history. They include: * Ophelia Clenlans, civil rights leader in Omaha * Harrison J.

The party was made up of three major groups: the Lagos Progressives, Club 19, and the Nigerian Council of Understanding. The Lagos progressives included some Lagos based NCNC politicians such as Adeniran Ogunsanya, T.O.S. Benson and Kola Balogun. The National Council of understanding was led by Waziri while Club 19 had Matthew Mbu, Solomon Lar, Omo Omoruyi, Paul Unongo, Antonio Fernandez and others as members. Though the party was formed to create a national outlook, the exit of Waziri Ibrahim, led to an erosion of politics without borders. Waziri's exit was precipitated because he wanted to be the chairman and also the presidential candidate of the party. The party later came to be seen as an eastern Nigerian party, though it hard scores of support in Plateau State, Rivers State and Lagos. The party tried to promote social justice and social change as vital ingredients of its mission. In 1979, the party chose former president Nnamdi Azikiwe as its presidential candidate. In states like Imo State, leaders such as the governor, Sam Mbakwe were elected with landslide victories (over 80%) in the Imo State Legislative, Gubernatorial and Presidential Elections in Nigeria in 1979. In Imo State, the NPP Campaign Director, Party Secretary and principal architect in electing Sam Mbakwe, was Dr. Sebastian Okechukwu Mezu. Before the 1979 elections, the party took some political hits, about 254 of its candidates were disqualified from contesting electoral seats, the second most out of the five major parties. Nevertheless, the party won about 17% of the House of Representative seats and three gubernatorial elections. Second Republic During the Second Republic, the National Party of Nigeria's (NPN) weak hold on the House of Assembly led to an alliance between the NPP and the NPN. The NPP submitted a few candidates for ministerial appointments to consummate the alliance. NPP personalities such as Ishaya Audu, a vice presidential candidate of the party, were selected as ministers. However, the accord hit the rocks in 1981, and Adeniran Ogunsanya, the chairman of the party, asked all ministers to resign; many did not heed his call and some transferred to the NPN.

Before using such tools it is important to have a complete understanding of horses and what attributes are important in evaluating horses. A horse is a unique individual and sometimes impossible to value. Horse value is usually used as a pre-qualification pricing factor related to the issuance of equine insurance or purchase. An objective evaluation of a horse's attributes such as: conformation, disposition, training level, pedigree, intellect and temperament. The health, soundness and bad vices should be considered for overall purpose of the horse. In most cases veterinarians can perform a pre-purchase examine. For a proper horse valuation, a horse breed, color, age, sex and location of horse are also important factors for market demand considerations.

Durance began as a guest star in season four but was promoted to series regular status beginning in season five. The character of Lois Lane, first created for comic books by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in 1938 to be the love interest for Clark Kent and his alter-ego Superman, was adapted to television in 2001 by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar--this is the fourth time the character has been adapted into a live-action television series. In Smallville, Lois comes to town to investigate the apparent death of her cousin Chloe Sullivan at the start of the fourth season. After finding Chloe still alive, Lois is forced to enroll in Smallville High to complete the remaining credits of high school she failed to achieve. As the series progresses, her interest in journalism grows, first writing a couple of articles for the Smallville High Torch in season four, landing a job at the Inquisitor in season six, and finally being hired at the Daily Planet in season seven. Throughout seasons four, five, six and seven, Lois's relationship with Clark Kent is depicted more as a brother/sister relationship, with the two characters often butting heads. By season eight, Lois begins to realize that she is falling in love with Clark, and by season nine the two become an official couple. During season ten the relationship goes through several milestones and midseason the pair get engaged. Series developers Gough and Millar had always envisioned bringing the character of Lois Lane to Smallville, but it was not until the end of season three that the creative team had the right storyline to bring her in. Erica Durance was hired to portray the iconic female reporter from the comic books. Smallville's interpretation of Lois was designed to embody similar traits to that of various leading female characters in the film. Described as \\"fiercely independent\\", critics have favorably compared this version of Lois Lane against the other live-action performances of the character in both film and television. Role in Smallville Lois Lane makes her first appearance in season four's \\"Crusade\\" when she comes to Smallville investigating the death of her cousin Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack). While investigating Chloe's death with Clark Kent (Tom Welling) in \\"Gone\\", the pair uncover the truth that Chloe is still alive, but in witness protection until Lionel Luthor's trial, the man she is testifying against with evidence that he orchestrated the death of his own parents. Lionel (John Glover) discovers the truth and sends someone to kill her, but Lois and Clark stop the would-be killer, allowing Chloe to testify. Before Lois can leave Smallville, her father (Michael Ironside) informs her that she failed to achieve all of her high school credits and that he has enrolled her in Smallville High so that she can complete her twelfth- grade year. Staying with the Kents, Lois begins attending Smallville High. In \\"FaœÇade\\", Chloe convinces her to become a reporter for the Torch in an effort to help Lois earn some of her remaining credits. With Lex Luthor's (Michael Rosenbaum) help in the episode \\"Devoted\\", Clark manages to get Lois her remaining credits ahead of schedule so that she can attend Metropolis University, and vacate his bedroom. In season five's \\"Fanatic\\", Jonathan Kent (John Schneider), who is running for the state senate, asks Lois to be his campaign manager after witnessing her take charge against his former campaign manager, whom Jonathan fires when he published a statement that goes against Jonathan's values. In \\"Fragile\\", Lois continues her duties under Martha Kent (Annette O'Toole), who is requested by the Governor to take Jonathan's place after he suffers a fatal heart attack. In season six's \\"Sneeze\\", Lois discovers an interest in journalism after she is almost struck by a barn door that falls out of the sky while she is jogging. Her story is bought by the Inquisitor, a tabloid newspaper that gives her a job as a reporter. In \\"Wither\\", she begins a romantic relationship with billionaire Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley), who, unbeknown to her, masquerades at night as the vigilante Green Arrow. Queen's \\"job\\" as Green Arrow often gets in the way of their relationship. In \\"Hydro\\", Lois deduces that Oliver is Green Arrow, setting up an elaborate scheme to prove it. Clark and Oliver are wise to her plan, however, and Clark dresses up as Green Arrow to throw Lois off Oliver's trail. When Oliver is forced to leave Metropolis to track down all of Lex's experimental facilities, in the episode \\"Justice\\", his relationship with Lois comes to an end. In season six's \\"Prototype\\", Lois discovers that Lex has been doing experimental research on army soldiers, one of which was her best friend. As a result, Lois decides in \\"Phantom\\" to begin looking into Lex's LuthorCorp projects. In season seven's \\"Kara\\", while looking into Lex's research projects, Lois discovers an alien spaceship. Her attempt to craft a news story out of the situation lands her a job at the Daily Planet‚Äîin the basement alongside her cousin Chloe. While at the Daily Planet, Lois begins a new relationship with her editor Grant Gabriel (Michael Cassidy) in the episode \\"Wrath\\". Their relationship comes under scrutiny from Chloe and Lex in \\"Blue\\", with Chloe seeing it as a reason for co-workers to doubt Lois's true ability as a journalist, and Lex believing it will jeopardize the secret of Grant's true identity. In \\"Gemini\\", the two finally agree to part ways. In the season eight premiere, Lois believes that Lex is responsible for Chloe's arrest by the Department of Domestic Security, and goes to his mansion to search his files for her location. She eventually discovers Chloe's whereabouts and arrives, alongside Clark, to save her. In \\"Plastique\\", Lois takes Clark under her wing‚Äîteaching him how to be a reporter‚Äîafter he accepts an internship at the Daily Planet, sitting at the desk directly across from Lois. Her feelings for Clark become stronger as the season progresses, admitting in the episode \\"Committed\\" that she is in love with Clark, and stating to Oliver in the episode \\"Bride\\" that she has never felt this way about someone before. In the same episode, she almost shares a kiss with Clark before being interrupted by the arrival of Clark's ex-girlfriend Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk). In the season eight finale, Lois and Tess Mercer (Cassidy Freeman), Lex Luthor's handpicked successor to LuthorCorp, get into a physical fight at the Daily Planet. During the fight, Lois picks up a Legion ring that falls out of Clark's desk and is instantly transported to another time and place. In season nine, Lois returns from the future suffering from visions of Earth having been overrun by aliens, led by Zod (Callum Blue). This season, Lois and Clark officially begin a romantic relationship, while Lois also begins assisting \\"The Blur\\" in his heroic endeavors. Lois's trust in Clark is shaken when she thinks Clark is jealous of her relationship with \\"The Blur\\", and that he does not understand her need to find value in her own life's work. Ultimately, Lois deduces Clark's true identity as \\"The Blur\\" in the season nine finale. Lois and Clark's relationship reaches its peak in the tenth and final season. Clark finally confesses his secret to her in \\"Isis\\" and they begin their relationship again free of secrets. He proposed marriage in \\"Icarus\\". In the episode \\"Beacon\\", with Chloe's help, Lois rallies faithful fans of \\"The Blur\\" and repeals the Vigilante Registration Act (VRA), helping Clark and the Justice League preserve their secret identities. In \\"Masquerade\\" and \\"Booster\\", Lois convinces Clark to develop an alter-ego as a way of hiding his true identity as the heroic \\"Blur\\". In the episode \\"Prophecy\\", Lois is given Clark's powers for a day, as a wedding gift by his biological father Jor-El, and realizes that the devotion they have for each other is Clark's greatest weakness, and calls off the wedding. In the series finale, Clark convinces Lois that her being in his life makes him stronger, but the ceremony is interrupted by Darkseid's sudden invasion of the Earth. Lois convinces the US military not to bomb Darkseid's homeworld of Apokolips, allowing Clark to finally embrace his destiny and defeat Darkseid himself. Portrayal Series developer Al Gough contends that it was always the producer's intention to bring in the iconic Lois Lane, they just needed a good reason to do it‚ÄîChloe's supposed death at the end of season three appeared to be that reason. Gough explains that, when casting for the role, they looked to Margot Kidder‚ÄîLois Lane in the Superman film series‚Äîfor inspiration. They wanted an actress who was \\"pretty\\", \\"smart\\", and who came with some \\"wit\\". Dozens of actresses auditioned for the role of Lois Lane, but it was not until a tape from Erica Durance showed up that everyone felt that they had found the right Lois. As executive producer Greg Beeman describes Durance, \\"She had a toughness about her. She was tough and sexy and direct.\\" Another plus, according to Beeman, was the chemistry between Durance and Tom Welling. Durance came on set that first afternoon and the two hit it off, becoming friends and developing a brother/sister relationship on the set. The lateness of her casting forced Durance to start filming only three days after being hired, with no time to prepare for the role. Under the initial agreement, Durance was only to portray the character for a total of four episodes, but, after a discussion with Peter Roth over how they planned to use the character on the show‚Äîinsisting that she and Clark would not be having a romantic relationship‚Äîthe feature film division then cleared the character for more episodes. After the character was cleared for more episodes, the creative team decided to plant her in the Kent home so that she could provide a constant annoyance to Clark. To separate the physical appearance of Lana and Lois from each other, the producers had highlights added to Durance's hair, as she and Kristin Kreuk both shared a similar brunette coloring. Character development=Storyline= Series writer Brian Peterson discusses how the writing staff chose to develop the character: \\"In the Smallville pilot, Al and Miles established Lex and Clark as best friends, which is, to me, one of the best aspects of the show. So when you're introducing his future love interest, why not introduce her, not as an enemy, but as the one who is constantly going to butt heads with him, where they're not gonna like each other at all at first? I think that because we chose such a different take on her, it wasn't that intimidating. She could grow into the person that everybody sees on-screen later.\\"Byrne, Craig, (Season 4 Companion) pp. 138-141 For season six, the writers chose to start Lois down the path of investigative journalism, only in this version of the character she gets her start working for a tabloid newspaper. Writer Kelly Souders felt that if tabloid beginnings were good enough for Perry White‚Äîan additional character established in season three's \\"Perry\\"‚Äîthen they are good enough for Lois Lane. It adds depth to the character by showing how she struggled before becoming \\"the reporter we all know and love\\". As Lois steps closer to her ultimate destiny at the Daily Planet, the writers have continued to evolve the character by having her grow out of the \\"black and white\\" mindset and have her begin seeing shades of gray. The writers wanted the character to realize that there is sometimes a middle road that has to be taken. In season eight, Durance sees Clark taking a job at the Daily Planet as a chance for her character to \\"step it up and be more involved\\". In this case, Lois is acting more mature, taking charge in being a mentor to Clark as he transitions into his new job. Durance describes the eighth season as a lesson in duality, with Clark realizing that he has to be two different people if he wants to have a life and save the day; Durance believes that the same applies to Lois. As Durance explains, \\"[Lois has] got her confidence as a journalist and on the inside, she's going oh my god I'm truly in love with [Clark], more in love than I've ever been with anyone.\\" =Characteristics= When developing the characteristics of their version of Lois Lane, the writers took inspiration from other leading ladies in cinema, for example, Karen Allen's character Marion Ravenwood, from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Todd Slavkin describes the character as having a \\"sophisticated, worldly experience\\", and was considered to be more of an adult than the rest of the cast. Durance believes that she embodies many of the characteristics that the creative team wanted to show in their version of Lois, specifically the fact that Lois has a lot of \\"nervous energy\\" from trying to \\"find herself\\", the same nervous energy that Durance brings to the role. The actress also relates to Lois's sassy, and independent nature, but, conversely, she is not as extroverted as Lois. Gough describes the character as coming from the school of hard knocks; she is street smart, and a very capable woman. Durance believes her character is \\"fiercely independent\\", but at the same time she is not afraid to admit that she has flaws, and she is only human; Lois also does not feel sorry about having those flaws. She goes into further detail, identifying the character as more of a tomboy who is vulnerable, with Gough adding that she is also \\"slightly neurotic\\". BuddyTV's John Kubicek characterizes her as a fast- talking woman, who, though she whines over petty annoyances, can take care of herself. He goes on to further describe how she is not afraid of getting herself into trouble just so she can dig herself out. =Relationships= One of Lois's key relationships is with Clark, who is her husband in the comics. For Smallville, the characters' relationship is in constant development. Darren Swimmer describes the relationship between Lois and Clark in season five as \\"a bit of a melting of the ice\\". The two characters continue to \\"butt heads\\", but the audience can see where there is a growing attraction and that either would be there for the other in a time of need. According to Erica Durance, in season five it is not yet clear if either character realizes the attraction, but the joking between the two characters represents a foreshadowing of a greater relationship. Durance believes that because of Lois's self-imposed walls, even if she thought about Clark in a romantic notion for just an instant she would immediately make it out to be a joke because she is not ready for that type of closeness, yet. The actress sees season five as being too soon for the characters to be \\"in-love\\" because they are still getting to know each other.Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pp.124-127 Writer Brian Peterson describes Lois's relationship with Oliver Queen in season six as a precursor to her future relationship with Clark. As Peterson sees it, it is the dynamic between her and Oliver, with her willingness to accept Oliver's secret identity as Green Arrow as mirroring the relationship she will have with Clark. As far as season six is concerned, the relationship between Lois and Clark is still undefined for the audience. As Durance describes it, neither character is willing to put an official label on their relationship. The pair has learned to deal with each other's \\"quirks\\", but there are still moments that both feel uncomfortable with. Instead at this point, Durance believes that Clark and Lois are satisfied with identifying with a \\"brother-sister friendship\\" label, than trying to discover how they both truly feel about each other.Byrne, Craig, (Season 6 Companion) pp. 124-127 Reception Erica Durance has been nominated for two Saturn Award nominations in the Best Supporting Actress category for her performance as Lois Lane. The first came in 2005, after her first season with the show, and then again the following year. Before the end of Smallville's seventh season, IGN's Daniel Phillips compared the actresses who have portrayed the character of Lois Lane over the past three decades. Up against the most recognizable version of Lois Lane, Margot Kidder, the 2006 film incarnation played by Kate Bosworth, and the previous live-action television version portrayed by Teri Hatcher, Erica Durance was rated the highest. Although Phillips acknowledges that Kidder is the best representation of Lois' personality, he claims that Durance is the best overall embodiment of the character. Apart from her beauty, Phillips states, \\"Durance makes Lois intelligent, capable, funny and dangerously curious ‚Äì exactly the type of woman Clark Kent would fall for.\\" Mike Moody of TV Squad named Lois as one of five reasons to watch Smallville's eighth season. Moody believes that Durance's Lois is \\"one of the best versions of the character\\" because Durance plays her as \\"tough, brainy, sexy and catty\\", which makes her portrayal that much better than Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane in Superman Returns. BuddyTV's John Kubicek likens the actress's performance‚Äîher \\"stylized delivery of lines\\"‚Äîto that of actresses from the 1940s screwball comedy era. Other media appearances=Comic books= In 2012, the Smallville series was continued through the comic book medium with Smallville: Season 11. Written by Bryan Q. Miller, who also wrote for the television series, Lois's story continues as she lives her life with Clark, who has now become known to the world as \\"Superman\\".Smallville Season 8 vol. 11 #1 (April 2012) Her involvement with Clark also allows her to meet Gotham City's elusive vigilante Batman,Smallville Season 11 vol. 1 #7 (November 2012) and subsequently learn his secret identity and befriend Batman's partner Nightwing (Barbara Gordon).Smallville Season 11 vol. 1 #8 (December 2012) She also teams up with the Amazon Princess Diana Prince, and DEO's agent Steve Trevor was one of Lois's former boyfriends.Smallville Season 11 vol. 1 #16 (August 2013) When Lois accepts an assignment to Africa to investigate mysterious reports surrounding a vigilante, known as \\"Angel of the Plateau.\\" She is caught in a terrorist attack after her arrival but is saved by Lana, who is revealed to be the superheroine Lois investigates.

However, Lois tries to keep the fact that Clark is now in the relationship with her from Lana. Both Lois and Lana also find themselves targeted by the latter's enemies, and they send John Corben to defeat Lana. Lois helps the powerless Lana in defeating Corben, and Lana reveals that she knows about her relationship with Clark as she saw the engagement ring before Lois hid it. Lois receives the blessing from Lana.Smallville Season 11 Specials #2 (June (2013) After Oliver and Chloe's son Jonathan is born, they named Lois and Clark as the child's godparents.Smallville: Continuity #4 (March 2015) =Arrowverse= In December 2019, Durance reprised her role as Lois Lane in the Arrowverse crossover event, \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\". In the second episode of the crossover event, she appears after Earth-38 Lex Luthor retreats after failing to kill Clark. She thinks Clark is joking when he tells her about the looming destruction of the multiverse. Lois and Clark are now married with young daughters living on the Kent farm, and Clark gave up his powers for his family.

C3b is the larger of two elements formed by the cleavage of complement component 3, and is considered an important part of the innate immune system. C3b is potent in opsonization: tagging pathogens, immune complexes (antigen-antibody), and apoptotic cells for phagocytosis. Additionally, C3b plays a role in forming a C3 convertase when bound to Factor B (C3bBb complex), or a C5 convertase when bound to C4b and C2b (C4b2b3b complex) or when an additional C3b molecule binds to the C3bBb complex (C3bBb3b complex). C3b's ability to perform these important functions derives from its ability to covalently bind to the surface of invading pathogens within an organism's body. The cleavage of C3 leaves C3b with an exposed thioester bond, allowing C3b to effectively coat and tag foreign cells by covalently binding to hydroxyl (-OH) and amine (-NH2) groups on foreign cell surfaces. This cleavage can occur via three mechanisms (classical pathway, alternative pathway and lectin pathway) that ultimately lead to the formation of a C3 convertase. Formation of a C3 convertase functions as a positive feedback loop, so as more C3b is cleaved, more C3 convertases are formed, further amplifying the signal on the surface of the microbial invader. This amplification of signal serves as a powerful tool for the immune system in effective clearance of the invading pathogen.  C3 convertase = Classical pathway = In the classical pathway, the microbial pathogen is coated in antibodies (IgG and IgM) released by B cells. The C1 complement complex binds to these antibodies resulting in its activation via cross proteolysis. This activated C1 complex cleaves C4 and C2 forming a C4bC2b complex that covalently bonds to the surface of the microbe and functions as a C3 convertase, binding and cleaving C3 into C3a and C3b. Binding of a C3b molecule to the C4bC2b complex (C4b2b3b) results in the formation of a C5 convertase, which cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. C5b associates with C6, C7, C8, and C9, all of which form a complex that results in a pore through the pathogen's membrane. This pore disrupts the ionic and osmotic balance provided by the pathogen's membrane, and leads to the death of the pathogen cell. = Alternative pathway = In the alternative pathway, C3, present in the blood stream, spontaneously cleaves at low rates into C3b and C3a. If a microbe is present, the C3b component will covalently bind to the surface of foreign invader. It then associates with Factor B, which is cleaved by Factor D into Factor Bb. This C3bBb convertase is stabilized by properdin (Factor P) preferentially on microbial surfaces over normal host surfaces, and is now able to cleave many more C3 molecules thus amplifying the signal. Incorporation of an additional C3b into the C3bBb C3 convertase leads to the formation of C3Bb3b C5 convertase.  Opsonization and pathogen clearance  Once cleaved C3b can either generate C3 or C5 convertases, as mentioned above, or else covalently bind to the microbial surface, tagging the cell for phagocytosis in a process known as opsonization. Additionally, C3b molecules can attach to the Fc regions of antigen-bound antibodies leading to phagocytosis or movement to the liver, where the C3b-tagged immune complex is then destroyed. In both cases C3b interacts with the C3b receptor, complement receptor 1 on phagocytic cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, allowing for engulfment of the pathogen. Furthermore, erythrocytes with Cr1 on their surface bind and deliver the immune complexes to the mononuclear phagocyte system via interactions with C3b.  Regulation  The key to the success of the complement system in clearing antigens is regulating the effects of C3b to pathogens alone and not healthy, host cells. This is done through several different mechanisms. One mechanism, mentioned above, is the stabilization of the C3bBb convertase by properdin preferentially on microbial surfaces, not on host surfaces, a step necessary for formation of a functional C3 convertase. Furthermore, if C3b does bind to a host-cell surface, regulators of complement activity (RCAs), a group of genetically-, structurally-, and functionally- related proteins, inactivate the complement component. Given the C3 is constantly being turned over in the alternative pathway and its ability to rapidly amplify a signal, these proteins are important in regulating the temporal and spatial effects of C3b to infected tissues. An example RCA is membrane cofactor protein (MCP; CD46), which is ubiquitously expressed and plays a critical role in protecting host cells from damage by the C3b. Furthermore, host cells express p33 (globular C1q receptor) on the surface, which binds C1q, and prevents it from initiating complement activation.  Clinical significance  Due to the importance of C3b, disruptions resulting in deficiencies or up regulation of C3b generation can have serious implications for human health. For example, the uncontrolled cleavage of C3b is associated with the disease C3 glomerulopathy, in which deposits of C3 in the glomeruli disrupt kidney function and can eventually result in kidney failure. Patients with diseases associated with elevated levels of immune complexes such as systemic lupus erythematosus, leprosy, and AIDS are found to have significantly decreased levels of the C3b receptor, Cr1, expression on erythrocytes, as well as altered expression of Cr1 on neutrophils in response to stimulation. Healthy neutrophils increase their Cr1 expression tenfold in response to chemoattractant peptides. However, patients with diseases such as AIDS don't display this response to stimulation, which results in reduced phagocytosis by the neutrophils and likely plays a critical role in disease progression.

It is a short novel, originally written as a series of tales (\\"Tedium\\") in a literary workshop. Some people rejected the novel because it freely touched (and portrayed) topics like abortion and sex, but the writers' community praised it immensely. Despite Gabriel¬¥s intellectual tone, the book was a huge editorial success, establishing Jose Agustin as a respected and profitable writer. The novel was Agust√≠n's first work. A distinguished writer said at the time that he liked it, but it was \\"naively pedantic.\\" Plot summary Situated in Mexico City in the 1960s, its main character, Gabriel Gu√≠a, is a teenager holding a somewhat cynical and disenchanted view of life and himself. He has the usual adventures of a Mexican rebellious teen in the 1960s, told in slang and a direct tone. He knows French, loves the good music (clearly references from Wagner's Lohengrin but also Stravinsky, jazz and rock and roll) writes tales and poetry, and makes many references and citations of authors like Arthur Rimbaud and Chekhov, some of his more intellectual friends sharing his interest. Beginning of a style The importance of La Tumba is that the author invented a new narrative concept, with a different sensitivity, a colloquial, fresh and totally uncensored (for the time) language. Characters The main character is Gabriel Gu√≠a, a teenage high school student, son of a rich couple in Mexico City. He will meet other characters: * Dora Castillo, Gabriel's classmate, friend and the cause of various problems and adventures of Gabriel. She is the first girl in the book who has sex with him. * Jacques Mu√±iz, head of the modern literary circle, where Gabriel meets some of the people that change his way of life. * Germaine Giradoux, a girl that becomes Gabriel's girlfriend. * Laura Gu√≠a, Gabriel's cousin. Gabriel gets along with her, but she dies in a car accident after partying with him. * Elsa Galv√°n, a girl who Gabriel really loves, she becomes his girlfriend, problems arising from their relationship lead to the climactic end of the novel.

The strip first appeared in Spirou magazine in 1992. Since 1995, her adventures have been published in book form by Dupuis--the 27th album came out in 2019. Five albums have been published in English by Cinebook. Characters=Castle inhabitants= *M√©lusine is a beautiful and kind-hearted young witch with flaming red hair. In the first album, it is revealed that she is actually 119 years old. Although originally under the impression that she was hired to do magic, she lives as a sort of au pair in a sinister old castle. Outside of doing household chores, she is often performing spells and brewing potions. She also attends a witches' school where she is at the top of her class. However, she is hardly a teacher's pet since her spells work so well that they cause the teacher unexpected aggro, resulting in lessons being suspended: on one occasion, for example, the class had to materialize various objects from out of thin air. These ranged from flies to toads with marks ranging from 0 to 4 out of 10. M√©lusine conjured up a huge monster which landed right on top of the teacher: she got a 10 and class was suspended. *Count Gonzaga Hernyvanz and his wife, the Duchess Aymee D√∂perzonn, are the master and mistress of the castle where M√©lusine works: a somewhat goofy male vampire and a stern female ghost. M√©lusine always addresses them as \\"sir\\" and \\"madam\\", and their real names were only revealed in the eleventh album. Their manservant is called Winston and likes eating cats; he resembles both Lurch and Frankenstein's monster. *Doctor Kartoffeln was first seen in the eleventh album. A descendant of the original owner of the castle, he claimed to be its rightful owner only to learn that his ancestor had gambled it away. However, Count Gonzaga Hernyvanz allowed him to stay since he could brew some very good tasting blood. Kartoffeln continues his scientific experiments and has been tampering with technology. He is particularly attached to Winston, as his great- grandfather was apparently the one who created him. M√©lusine finds his mad scientific experiments disturbing, not to mention adding to her housework. School was therefore appealing since it enabled her to get away from him-- until he was hired as a teacher. *The mummy also lives in the castle. Although nothing more than a skeleton wrapped in bandages, he still has feelings, and is often caught peeping through the keyhole into M√©lusine's room. He featured in the early strips but has not been used since. =M√©lusine's relatives= *Adrazelle is M√©lusine's nutty old aunt (542 years old, as is revealed in the third album). She lives in a shack somewhere in the neighborhood, and often visits her niece in the castle. She can also be seen speeding across the skies on her broomstick, wearing racing goggles, and seems to have a fondness for toad soup and sabbaths. *M√©lisande was first introduced in the seventh album. She is M√©lusine's friendly but silly cousin and is not a witch but a fairy, and thus considered a disgrace to the family. She wears pink and blue and does nothing but conjure up bunnies, sweets and pastries with her magic wand, mumbling things like Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo (a reference to Cinderella's fairy godmother in the Disney version of the story). In volume 26, she is revealed to be M√©lusine's sister, as their mother is in fact a fairy. *Pirouline is M√©lusine's half-sister, though, as M√©lusine herself points out, it is more the reverse since Pirouline is twice her weight and age. Her heavy eating appears to be due to being a single mother--and when you consider the child... *Malicella is Pirouline's daughter. She is 112 years old (12 in witches' terms) and is rebellious, unpleasant and troublesome. M√©lusine finds herself stuck with her for awhile (see volume 15 L'Apprentie sorci√®re (\\"The Witch's Apprentice\\")) and goes through the difficulties of keeping her under control and teaching her magic. When she asks Malicella when her mother will take her back, she reveals that the last time she was entrusted to a third-party was over a period of four years! However, Pirouline soon re-appears and leaves with her progeny--much to the relief of M√©lusine and her friends. =School= M√©lusine attends a school for magic which was originally based in a small house in the woods. The premises got blown up as a result of Crancrelune's mishandling of dangerous mixtures. They thus moved to a castle which included a large library and more staff. To give even the hopeless Crancrelune the incentive to pass the exams, Haaselblatt, the teacher, announced that they would be held in the torture chamber. *Cancrelune is M√©lusine's incredibly clumsy and rather dim-witted best friend. Also a witch, she is frequently seen crashing into walls or windows on her broomstick, screwing up spells and potions, or panicking about examinations. What magic she can do successfully is the sleight of hand sort used by stage magicians. The comic strips of the thirteenth album focused, appropriately enough, around her many superstitious beliefs. Cancre-lune literally translates as \\"dunce-moon\\". *Krapella is another student in M√©lusine's class and her other best friend. Distinguishable by her somewhat risqu√© attire (black tube top, miniskirt, thigh-high fishnet stockings and pumps), she is the more outgoing, party-hardy of the group. Although quite competent herself, she does fall a little short of her more bookwormish friend. Always up for a bit of fun, she'll often be the first to forgo studies and drag her friends along with her to partake in various hijinks. *Mister Haaselblatt is a teacher at the witches' school who was first introduced in the third album. He's small and chubby, and incredibly mean and demanding. He tends to insult his pupils, addressing them as \\"losers\\" or \\"morons\\", instead of encouraging them. He is often outsmarted by M√©lusine, whose spells work so well that they result in chaos and school being suspended for the day--to the delight of M√©lusine and the other students. *Mister Purul√≥vskovar teaches the class about demonic forces. Muscular, but with an exceptionally ugly face, he looks particularly menacing even when he doesn't try to be and, when speaking, insects fall from his mouth. When he gets a cold, slimy creatures (slug, octopus) are expelled instead. *Mister Charles Rimbaut teaches cooking. He is an ordinary-looking and quite friendly man, though, M√©lusine finds him and his lessons dull and tedious since they have little to do with magic. They were the focus of the fourteenth album, La Cuisine du diable (French for \\"Hell's Kitchen\\"). =Others= *The Werewolf is a very sophisticated character, who is very taken with M√©lusine. He is probably the nearest she has to a boyfriend and she appreciates him, though, most of the time, she fantasizes being seduced by a handsome prince. The fact that he can only appear during a full moon makes him rather limited-- especially since, in human form, he is a weak and pathetic little man and would rather she did not see him as such. *Although many of the villagers occasionally turn to M√©lusine for help--asking for love potions, hair-growing remedies and the like--there is also a group of people that are out to burn her at the stake. This group is led by the town's fanatical pastor, who's obsessed with putting a stop to witchcraft, but never succeeds.

Description The shrub or tree typically grows to a height of and has an erect to speading habit. It has finely or deeply fissured bark that is usually a dark grey colour. The glabrous branchlets are more or less terete and occasionally covered in a fine white powdery coating. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The glabrous and evergreen phyllodes have a narrowly oblanceolate or narrowly elliptic shape and are straight to slightly curved with a length of and a width of with a prominent midvein and marginal veins and are finely penniveined. The plant blooms throughout the year producing pale yellow flowers. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1825 as part of the work Leguminosae. Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis. It was reclassified as Racosperma penninerve by Leslie Pedley in 1986 then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2006.

The variety A. p. var. penninervis occurs in the same Australian states of Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria. The variety A. p. var. longiracemosa occurs in coastal districts of southern Queensland, and northern New South Wales. Uses The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia‚Äô records that common names included \\"Hickory\\" and \\"Blackwood\\" and that \\"The bark (and, according to some, the leaves) of this tree was formerly used by the aboriginals [sic.] of southern New South Wales for catching fish. They would throw them into a waterhole, when the fish would rise to the top and be easily caught. Neither the leaves nor bark contain strictly poisonous substances, but, like the other species of Acacia, they would be deleterious, owing to their astringency.\\" Its uses include environmental management.

They are found in various species of the Phylum Apicomplexa. The Apicomplexa phylum contains several parasitic protozoans. They have a very complex life cycle that includes several stages. Megaloschizonts and the smaller schizonts are the part of the life cycle that takes place inside the infected host organism and operates as an asexually reproductive cell. Megaloschizonts appear as grey-white nodules found in the smooth muscle of major organs, such as the heart, liver, lung or spleen.  History of the Term  The term was first used by Clay G. Huff from the University of Chicago.Huff, Clay G. (1942). Schizogony and gametocyte development in Leucocytozoon simondi and comparisons with Plasmodium and Haemoproteus in studying parasitic diseases. The Journal of Infectious Diseases. Volume 71. Oxford University Press. In studying various infectious diseases caused by parasitic protozoans from the Apicomplexa phylum, Dr. Huff noticed two types of schizonts developing in the infected hosts. He noticed smaller schizonts were found in the hepatic regions of the host, these ranged in size from 11 to 18 micrometers. The larger schizonts, ranging in size from 60 to 105 micrometers, were found in blood vessels or in contact with the muscle tissue. Dr. Huff referred to these large schizonts as megaloshizonts. It was hypothesized that in this particular case, the megaloschizont (produced asexually) was responsible for producing merozoites that would develop into gametocytes, the sexually reproducing stage of the Apicomplexa life cycle.  Background Information  Megaloshizonts are part of the Apicomplexa life cycle. They are formed during a process called schizogony, which can also be called merogony. This is an asexual reproductive process found primarily in parasitic protists. The parasitic, infectious cell that infects a host is called a sporozoite. This sporozoite infects the host organism by entering the blood stream and eventually settling in a vital organ such as the heart, liver, lung, or spleen. Once infecting the host organisms cell, the sporozoite begins feeding and growing. While it is feeding and growing, the cell is known as a trophozoite. This trophozoite is the cell that begins the process of schizogony.Apicomplexia lifecycle. Accessed 4/13/2012. The process of schizogony is when a cell undergoes multiple nuclear divisions before undergoing cytokinesis or division of the cytoplasm. There is no specific number of nuclear divisions during schizogony. The number of nuclear divisions is species specific and even within a single species the number of nuclear divisions can differ depending on the phase of the life cycle. For example, Plasmodium (parasite that can cause malaria) undergoes four different types of schizogony producing anywhere from 8 to over 20,000 nuclei.Impact Malaria Training website. Accessed 4/13/12. A cell currently undgergoing schizogony is known as a schizont. If a cell has a very large number of nuclei, it is known as a megaloschizont. The thousands of nuclei in a megaloschizont become merozoites. Merozoites are non-mobile cells that are circulated through the host by the bloodstream and infect other cells in the host organism. Merozoites are released when the megaloschizont breaks apart. This can be caused by the megaloschizont simply reaching full capacity and self-lysing of the membrane or it can be caused by the membrane being attacked by the organisms immune-response cells.

The population has been reduced by more than 60% since 1990. Researchers collected blood samples from the penguins. They found Leucocytozoon hepatic megaloschizonts in up to 95% of the sampled organisms. This genus of parasite is known to cause many problems in closely related avian species. These problems include tissue damage, reduced fertility, and reduced growth. It was concluded that the yellow-eyed penguins were being infected by biting black flies in their nesting area. Scotland, 2006: A species of Besnoitia, a parasitic protozoan, from the Apicomplexa phyla was found in several parakeet-like avians in areas of Scotland. Megaloschizonts presented as gray nodules in several different areas of the infected organisms. The megaloschizonts were most numerous in the smooth muscle of the heart and gizzard, but were also found in smooth muscle of the intestine, lung, and skin.Stidworthy, Mark F. and Greenwood, Andrew G. (2006). Deaths in aviary birds associated with protozoal megaloschizonts. Veterinary Record. Volume 159. Issue 18. UK. Miami MetroZoo, 1992: 4 cases of hepatic coccidiosis were found in a herd of chamois at the Miami MetroZoo. Chamois are antelope-like animals that are found naturally in the mountains of Europe. The animals at the zoo died over a 7-year period. After completing necropsies, it was determined that the organisms were infected with a parasitic protozoan of the genus Eimeria. This species had produced megaloschizonts in the intrahepatic bile ducts and portal veins. The presence of these megaloschizonts was hypothesized to have caused periportal hepatitis and fibrosis. The infectious disease was determined to have contributed to the death of the organisms. Florida, U.S., 1987: A wild turkey that died in captivity two days after capture was found to be infected with megaloschizonts from Haemoproteus meleagridis. Haemoproteus is a genus of parasitic protozoa that belong to the Apicomplexa phyla. The megaloschizont cells measured 50 to 100 micrometers. The merozoites inside the megaloschizonts were less than 1 micrometer in diameter. The infectious cells were found in various sections of the host organism including the liver, the spleen, the intestines, and the cloaca. Smooth muscle tissue surrounding the megaloschizont cells was found to be partially calcified, pale, swollen, and early signs of necrosis were noted.Atkinson, Carter T. and Forrester, Donald J.

It was founded in the tradition of Saint John Baptist de Lasalle and rooted in the Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ. It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Providence. History In 1922, Bishop William Hickey commenced a campaign to raise funds for the expansion of LaSalle as well as the construction of two new Catholic high schools, one in Pawtucket and the other in Newport. By 1924, Bishop Hickey had raised the required funds and worked with the De La Salle Christian Brothers to open the two new secondary schools. The Pawtucket school was to be established in a large white mansion on Walcott Street that had been purchased from the Goff family for $95,000. An additional $60,000 was required to transform the residential building into appropriate classroom, library, and science lab space. When Brother Anselm Moore, F.S.C., arrived in Pawtucket in late August 1924, work was just beginning on the transformation. Brother Anselm worked 12-hour days for weeks overseeing the construction and enrolling new students. On September 10, 1924, the new Catholic high school on Walcott Street opened with 59 students, three faculty members, and an athletic director. On December 12, 1924, 17 pastors, representing the parishes that had students enrolled at the new school, met with Bishop Hickey and agreed that the name of the new institution should be Saint Raphael Academy. It did not take long for the Academy to outgrow its facilities. Without a gymnasium or proper cafeteria space and faced with an overwhelming number of applications for admission, Brother Ambrose met with Bishop Hickey and in 1927 signed a contract for the construction of a new school building. On January 1, 1929, the \\"new Saint Raphael Academy\\" was opened, featuring a gymnasium, six classrooms, a science lab, and a Principal's Office. In March 1929, nearly 1,000 people joined Bishop Hickey at the blessing the new facility. By the time the new building opened, the student body had grown to one hundred sixty students overseen by eight faculty members. By the 1970s, the enrollment at Catholic high schools had begun to decline and the condition of the Academy's facilities had deteriorated, forcing the tuition to rise. In September 1975, Brother Jerome Corrigan, Principal, accepted 112 young women from St. Jean Baptiste Academy, which had closed the previous summer. In order to accommodate the added enrollment, Brother Jerome worked out a lease agreement to use the former Saint Joseph's Elementary School. The now coeducational Saint Raphael Academy had an enrollment of 550 students and tuition of $500 annually. Enrollment continued to increase through the late 1970s, exceeding 700 students by the mid-1980s. The large number of students, along with the lack of space for computers and the arts, led Brother William Kemmemer, F.S.C., Principal, to launch the Academy's first capital campaign to fund the construction of an addition to the West Campus. Barbara Farley Hall opened in 1986, featuring a computer center, music room, art room, and classroom with athletic facilities in the basement. With tuition rising to over $3,500 annually and enrollment beginning to slide, in 1996, Brother Thomas Casey, F.S.C., Principal, along with the Academy's School Board, determined that building an endowment for tuition assistance, funding new technology initiatives, and constructing new science labs needed to become an immediate priority in order to ensure the school's long-term survival. Saint Raphael alumni helped the academy raise over $5 million in pledges during its historic Creating a Future capital campaign. The infusion of much needed capital gave Saint Raphael the opportunity to greatly increase its technological capabilities, offer additional tuition assistance to families, provide funds for faculty enrichment opportunities, create a new Administration Center and the Healey Library Media Center, purchase the former Saint Joseph's Elementary School, landscape the West Campus, and reconstruct the science facilities. In 2007, Alumni Hall was constructed on the site where once stood St. Joseph's Convent and the Father Barry CYO Center. In September 2007, St. Raphael Academy in Pawtucket, R.I. held the grand opening and dedication service for Alumni Hall, their new athletic and wellness center. That same year, the Saints' varsity football team won the Rhode Island Division 1 State Championship for the second time in school history, finishing with an undefeated 12‚Äì0 record. In 2020, the first cluster of COVID-19 cases in Rhode Island originated from St. Raphael Academy students and faculty who had travelled to Italy.

The Years of Lead are often considered to have begun with the Hot Autumn strikes starting in 1969; the death of the policeman Antonio Annarumma in November 1969; the Piazza Fontana bombing in December of that year, which killed 17 and was perpetrated by right-wing terrorists in Milan; and the subsequent death that same month of leftist anarchist worker Giuseppe Pinelli while in police custody under suspicion of a crime he did not commit. Origin of the name The term's origin possibly came as a reference to the number of shootings during the period, or a popular 1981 German film Marianne and Juliane, released in Italy as Anni di piombo, which centered on the lives of two members of the West German militant far-left group Red Army Faction which had gained notoriety during the same period.  Background  There was widespread social conflict and unprecedented acts of terrorism carried out by both right- and left-wing paramilitary groups. An attempt to endorse the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI) by the Tambroni Cabinet led to rioting and was short-lived. Widespread labor unrest and the collaboration of countercultural student activist groups with working class factory workers and pro-labor radical leftist organizations such as Potere Operaio and Lotta Continua culminated in the so-called \\"Hot Autumn\\" of 1969, a massive series of strikes in factories and industrial centres in Northern Italy. Student strikes and labour strikes, often led by workers, leftists, left-sympathizing laborers, or Marxist activists, became increasingly common, often deteriorating into clashes between the police and demonstrators composed largely of workers, students, activists, and often left-wing militants. Meanwhile, various far- right and neo-fascist militant and terrorist groups took advantage of the unrest and attempted to push Italy towards fascism through acts of terrorism. In the Cold War atmosphere in which there existed a strong fear of communism becoming a dominant force in Italy, these groups are alleged to have been backed to some extent by certain anti-communist and anti-leftist entities. The Christian Democrats (DC) were instrumental in the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) gaining power in the 1960s and they created a coalition. The assassination of the Christian Democrat leader Aldo Moro in 1978 ended the strategy of historic compromise between the DC and the Italian Communist Party (PCI). The assassination was carried out by the Red Brigades, then led by Mario Moretti. Between 1968 and 1988, 428 murders were attributed to political violence in the form of bombings, assassinations, and street warfare between rival militant factions.  History = 1969 = Public protests  Public protests shook Italy during 1969, with the autonomist student movement being particularly active, leading to the occupation of the Fiat Mirafiori automobile factory in Turin.  Killing of Antonio Annarumma  On 19 November 1969, Antonio Annarumma, a Milanese policeman, was killed during a riot by far-left demonstrators.http://www.cadutipolizia.it/fonti/1943 1981/1969annarumma.htm He was the first civil servant to die in the wave of violence.  Piazza Fontana bombing  The Monument to Victor Emmanuel II, the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro in Rome and the Banca Commerciale Italiana and the Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura in Milan were bombed in December. Local police arrested 80 or so suspects from left-wing groups, including Giuseppe Pinelli, an anarchist initially blamed for the bombing, and Pietro Valpreda. Their guilt was denied by left-wing members, especially by members of the student movement, then prominent in Milan's universities, as they believed that the bombing was carried out by fascists. Following the death of Giuseppe Pinelli, who mysteriously died on 15 December while in police custody, the radical left-wing newspaper Lotta Continua started a campaign accusing police officer Luigi Calabresi of Pinelli's murder. In 1975, Calabresi and other police officials were acquitted by judge Gerardo D'Ambrosio who decided that Pinelli's fall from a window had been caused by his being taken ill and losing his balance.Bull, Anna Cento and Cooke, Philip. Ending Terrorism in Italy, Routledge, 2013 .\\"N√© omicidio n√© suicidio: Pinelli cadde perch√© colto da malore\\", La Stampa, October 29, 1975 . Meanwhile, the anarchist Valpreda and five others were convicted and jailed for the bombing. They were later released after three years of preventive detention. Then, two neo-fascists, Franco Freda (resident in Padua) and Giovanni Ventura, were arrested accused of being the organizers of the massacre; in 1987 they were acquitted by the Supreme Court for lack of evidence.\\"STRAGE DI PIAZZA FONTANA AZZERATI 17 ANNI DI INDAGINI\\", la Repubblica, January 28, 1987 . In the 1990s, new investigations into the Piazza Fontana bombing, citing new witnesses testimony, implicated Freda and Ventura again. However, the pair cannot be put on trial again because of double jeopardy, as they were acquitted of the crime in 1987.\\"Freda e Ventura erano colpevoli\\", Corriere della Sera, June 11, 2005 . The Red Brigades, the most prominent far-left terrorist organization, conducted a secret internal investigation that paralleled the official inquiry.:it:Inchieste di Robbiano di Mediglia Inquiry of the Red Brigades in Italy wikipedia They ordered that the inquiry remain secret, because of the unfavorable light that it could shed on other terrorist organizations. The inquiry was discovered after a shootout between the Red Brigade and the Carabinieri at Robbiano di Mediglia in October 1974. The cover-up was exposed in 2000 by Giovanni Pellegrino, at the time President of the Commissione Stragi (Parliamentary Committee on massacres).:it:Commissione Stragi \\"Commissione Stragi\\" in Italy wikipedia = 1970 = Birth of the Red Brigades  The Red Brigades were founded in August 1970 by Renato Curcio and Margherita (Mara) Cagol, who had met as students at the University of Trento and later married, and Alberto Franceschini. While the Trento group around Curcio had its main roots in the Sociology Department of the Catholic University, the Reggio Emilia group (around Franceschini) mostly included former members of the FGCI (the Communist youth movement) expelled from the parent party for their extremist views. Another group of militants came from the Sit-Siemens factories in Milan; these were Mario Moretti, a union official, Corrado Alunni, who would leave the Red Brigades to found another organization \\"fighter\\", and Alfredo Buonavita, a blue-collar worker. The first action of the RB was burning the car of Giuseppe Leoni (a leader of Sit- Siemens company in Milan) on 17 September 1970, in the context of the labour unrest within the factory.  The Golpe Borghese  In December, a neo- fascist coup, dubbed the Golpe Borghese, was planned by young far-right fanatics, elderly veterans of Italian Social Republic, and supported by members of the Corpo Forestale dello Stato, along with right-aligned entrepreneurs and industrialists. The \\"Black Prince\\", Junio Valerio Borghese, took part in it. The coup, called off at the last moment, was discovered by the newspaper Paese Sera, and publicly exposed three months later. = 1971 = Assassination of Alessandro Floris  On March 26, Alessandro Floris was assassinated in Genoa by a unit of the October 22 Group, a far-left terrorist organization. An amateur photographer had taken a photo of the killer that enabled police to identify the terrorists. The group was investigated, and more members arrested. Some fled to Milan and joined the \\"Gruppi di Azione Partigiana\\" (GAP) and, later, the Red Brigades. The Red Brigades considered Gruppo XXII Ottobre its predecessor and, in April 1974, they kidnapped Judge Mario Sossi in a failed attempt at freeing the jailed members. Years later, the Red Brigades killed judge Francesco Coco on June 8, 1976, along with his two police escorts, Giovanni Saponara and Antioco Deiana, in revenge. = 1972 = Assassination of Luigi Calabresi  On 17 May 1972, police officer Luigi Calabresi, a recipient of the gold medal of the Italian Republic for civil valour, was killed in Milan. Authorities initially focused on suspects in Lotta Continua; then it was assumed that Calabresi had been killed by neo-fascist organizations, bringing about the arrest of two neo-fascist activists, Gianni Nardi and Bruno Stefano, along with German Gudrun Kiess, in 1974. They were ultimately released. Sixteen years later, Adriano Sofri, Giorgio Petrostefani, Ovidio Bompressi, and Leonardo Marino were arrested in Milan following Marino's confession to the murder. Their trial finally established their guilt in organising and carrying out the assassination. Calabresi's assassination opened the chapter of assassinations carried out by armed groups of the far-left.  Peteano bombing  On 31 May 1972, three Italian Carabinieri were killed in Peteano in a bombing, attributed to Lotta Continua. Officers of the Carabinieri were later indicted and convicted for perverting the course of justice.Carlo Ginzburg, The Judge and the Historian. Marginal Notes and a Late-Twentieth-century Miscarriage of Justice, London 1999, . Original ed. 1991. Judge Casson identified Ordine Nuovo member Vincenzo Vinciguerra as the man who had planted the Peteano bomb. The neo-fascist terrorist Vinciguerra, arrested in the 1980s for the bombing in Peteano, declared to magistrate Felice Casson that this false flag attack had been intended to force the Italian state to declare a state of emergency and to become more authoritarian. Vinciguerra explained how the SISMI military intelligence agency had protected him, allowing him to escape to Francoist Spain. Casson's investigation revealed that the right-wing organization Ordine Nuovo had collaborated with the Italian Military Secret Service, SID (Servizio Informazioni Difesa). Together, they had engineered the Peteano attack and then blamed the Red Brigades. He confessed and testified that he had been covered by a network of sympathizers in Italy and abroad who had ensured that he could escape after the attack. \\"A whole mechanism came into action\\", Vinciguerra recalled, \\"that is, the Carabinieri, the Minister of the Interior, the customs services and the military and civilian intelligence services accepted the ideological reasoning behind the attack.\\"Daniele Ganser, NATO's Secret Armies. Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe, Franck Cass, London, 2005, pp.3‚Äì4 = 1973 = Primavalle fire  A 16 April 1973 arson attack by members of Potere Operaio on the house of neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI) militant Mario Mattei in Primavalle, Rome, resulted in his two sons, aged 22 and 8, being burned alive.  Milan Police command bombing  During a 17 May 1973 ceremony honoring Luigi Calabresi, in which the Interior Minister was present, Gianfranco Bertoli, an anarchist, threw a bomb that killed four and injured 45. In 1975, Bertoli was sentenced to life imprisonment: the Milan Court wrote that he was embroiled in connections with the far-right, that was a SID informant and a confidant of the Police. In the 1990s it was suspected that Bertoli was a member of Gladio but he denied it in an interview: in the list of 622 Gladio members made public in 1990, his name is missing.\\"Io spia dei Servizi? Follia\\", La Stampa, March 21, 1995 .Camera dei deputati - relazione sulla vicenda Gladio ‚Äì allegati Elenco dei 622 nominativi e Parere dell‚ÄôAvvocatura dello Stato . A magistrate investigating the assassination attempt of Mariano Rumor found that Bertoli's files were incomplete. General Gianadelio Maletti, head of the SID from 1971 to 1975, was convicted in absentia in 1990 for obstruction of justice in the Mariano Rumor case. = 1974 = Piazza della Loggia bombing  In May 1974, a bomb exploded during an anti-fascist demonstration in Brescia, Lombardy, killing eight and wounding 102. On 16 November 2010, the Court of Brescia acquitted the defendants: Francesco Delfino (a Carabiniere), Carlo Maria Maggi, Pino Rauti, Maurizio Tramonte, and Delfo Zorzi (members of the Ordine Nuovo neo- fascist group). The prosecutor had requested life sentences for Delfino, Maggi, Tramonte, and Zorzi, and acquittal for lack of evidence for Pino Rauti. The four defendants were acquitted again by the appeal court in 2012 but, in 2014, the supreme court ruled that the appeal trial would have to be held again at the appeal court of Milan for Maggi and Tramonte. Delfino and Zorzi were definitively acquitted. On 22 July 2015, the appeal court sentenced Maggi and Tramonte to life imprisonment for ordering and co-ordinating the massacre.  First murder by the Red Brigades  On 17 June 1974, two members of MSI were murdered in Padua. Initially, an internal feud between neo-fascist groups was suspected, since the crime had occurred in the city of Franco Freda. However, the murder was then claimed by the Red Brigades: it was the first murder of the organization, which, until then had only committed robberies, bombings, and kidnappings.  Planned neo-fascist coup  Count Edgardo Sogno said in his memoirs that in July 1974, he visited the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) station chief in Rome to inform him of preparations for a neo-fascist coup. Asking what the United States (US) government would do in case of such a coup, Sogno wrote that he was told, \\"the United States would have supported any initiative tending to keep the communists out of government.\\" General Maletti declared, in 2001, that he had not known about Sogno's relationship with the CIA and had not been informed about the coup, known as Golpe bianco (White Coup), led by Randolfo Pacciardi.Philip Willan, \\"Terrorists 'helped by CIA' to stop rise of left in Italy\\", The Guardian, March 26, 2001.  Bombing of Italicus train  On 4 August 1974, 12 people were killed and 48 others injured in the bombing of the Italicus Rome- Brenner express train at San Benedetto Val di Sambro. Responsibility was claimed by the neo-fascist terrorist organization Ordine Nero.  Arrest of Vito Miceli  General Vito Miceli, chief of the SIOS military intelligence agency in 1969, and head of the SID from 1970 to 1974, was arrested in 1974 on charges of \\"conspiracy against the state\\". Following his arrest, the Italian secret services were reorganized by a 24 October 1977 law in an attempt to reassert civilian control over the intelligence agencies. The SID was divided into the current SISMI, the SISDE, and the CESIS, which was to directly coordinate with the Prime Minister of Italy. An Italian Parliamentary Committee on Secret services control (Copaco) was created at the same time. Miceli was acquitted in 1978.  Arrest of Red Brigades leaders  In 1974, some leaders of the Red Brigades, including Renato Curcio and Alberto Franceschini, were arrested, but new leadership continued the war against the Italian right-wing establishment with increased fervor. There were technical conditions for ending terrorism: however, the political class was unwilling: the Italian left wing was less worried by the existence of an armed organization than by the possible abuses by the police against protesters. It did therefore ask for the disarmament of police during street demonstrations. Also in the ruling Christian Democracy), many underestimated the threat of the Red Brigades (speaking of \\"phantom\\" Red Brigades), emphasizing instead that of neo-fascist groups. The year before, Potere Operaio had disbanded, although Autonomia Operaia carried on in its wake. Lotta Continua also dissolved in 1976, although their magazine struggled on for several years. From the remnants of Lotta Continua and similar groups, the terror organization Prima Linea emerged. = 1975 = On 28 February, student and fascist activist Mikis Mantakas was killed by far-leftists during riots in Rome. On 13 March, young militant of Italian Social Movement (MSI) Sergio Ramelli was assaulted in Milan by a group of Avanguardia Operaia and wounded in the head with wrenches (aka Hazet 36).

On 14 May, in Milan, activists from a far-left organization pulled out their pistols and began to shoot at the police, killing policeman Antonio Custra. A photographer took a photo of an activist shooting at the police. This year was called the time of the \\"P38\\", referring to the Walther P38 pistol. On 16 November, in Turin, Carlo Casalegno, deputy director of the newspaper La Stampa, was seriously wounded in an ambush of the Red Brigades. He died thirteen days later, on November 29. = 1978 = On 4 January, in Cassino, Fiat boss security services Carmine De Rosa was killed by leftists.

Kidnapping and assassination of Aldo Moro  On March 16, 1978, Aldo Moro was kidnapped by the Red Brigades (then led by Mario Moretti) and five of his security detail were killed. Aldo Moro was a left-leaning Christian Democrat who served several times as prime minister; before his murder, he had been trying to include the Italian Communist Party (PCI), headed by Enrico Berlinguer, in the government through a deal called the Historic Compromise. PCI was, at the time, the largest communist party in western Europe; was mainly because of its non-extremist and pragmatic stance, its growing independence from Moscow and its eurocommunist doctrine. The PCI was especially strong in areas such as Emilia Romagna, where it had stable government positions and mature practical experience, which may have contributed to a more pragmatic approach to politics. The Red Brigades were fiercely opposed by the Communist Party and trade unions: some left-wing politicians used the expression \\"comrades who do wrong\\" (Compagni che sbagliano). , one of RB's members who participated at the kidnapping, declared that the decision to kidnap Moro \\"was taken a week before, a day was decided, it could have been March 15 or 17\\". On May 9, 1978, after a summary \\"trial of the people\\", Moro was murdered by Mario Moretti with, it was also determined, the participation of .Flavio Haver, \\"Erano le 6.30, cos√¨ uccidemmo Moro\\", Corriere della Sera, June 20, 1996 . The corpse was found that same day in the trunk of a red Renault 4 in via Michelangelo Caetani, in downtown Rome. A consequence there was the fact that the PCI did not gain executive power. Moro's assassination was followed by a large clampdown on the social movement, including the arrest of many members of Autonomia Operaia, including, Oreste Scalzone and political philosopher Antonio Negri (arrested on 7 April 1979). = 1979 = Active armed organization grew from 2 in 1969 to 91 in 1977 and 269 in 1979.

The Virgin's head usually inclines towards the child, who raises his hand in a blessing gesture. In the Western Church this type of icon is sometimes called Our Lady of the Way. The most venerated icon of the Hodegetria type, regarded as the original, was displayed in the Monastery of the Panaghia Hodegetria in Constantinople, which was built specially to contain it. Unlike most later copies it showed the Theotokos standing full-length. It was said to have been brought back from the Holy Land by Eudocia, the wife of emperor Theodosius II (408‚Äì450), and to have been painted by Saint Luke the apostle himself.James Hall, A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art, p.91, 1983, John Murray, London, The icon was double-sided,Vasilakƒì; op & page cit with a crucifixion on the other side, and was \\"perhaps the most prominent cult object in Byzantium\\".Cormack:58 The original icon has probably now been lost, although various traditions claim that it was carried to Russia or Italy. There are a great number of copies of the image, including many of the most venerated of Russian icons, which have themselves acquired their own status and tradition of copying. Constantinople There are a number of images showing the icon in its shrine and in the course of being displayed publicly, which happened every Tuesday, and was one of the great sights of Constantinople for visitors. After the Fourth Crusade, from 1204 to 1261, it was moved to the Monastery of the Pantocrator, which had become the cathedral of the Venetian see during the period of Frankish rule, and since none of the illustrations of the shrine at the Hodegetria Monastery predate this interlude, the shrine may have been created after its return.Cormack There are a number of accounts of the weekly display, the two most detailed by Spaniards: Another account says the bearers staggered around the crowd, the icon seeming to lurch towards onlookers, who were then considered blessed by the Virgin. Clergy touched pieces of cotton- wool to the icon and handed them out to the crowd. A wall-painting in a church near Arta in Greece shows a great crowd watching such a display, whilst a street-market for unconcerned locals continues in the foreground.Cormack: illustration p.60 The Hamilton Psalter picture of the shrine in the monastery appears to show the icon behind a golden screen of large mesh, mounted on brackets rising from a four-sided pyramidal base, like many large medieval lecterns. The heads of the red-robed attendants are level with the bottom frame of the icon.Cormack:61 for display, 58 and illustration 9 for shrine The icon disappeared during the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 when it was deposited at the Chora Church. It may have been cut into four pieces.Warren Treadgold, A History of the Byzantine State and Society, Stanford, 1997 . Four pieces from Cormack:59 Hodegetria by Berlinghiero of Lucca, (c. 1230) shows the Byzantine influence on Italian 13th-century art (Metropolitan Museum) Spread of the image In the 10th century, after the period of iconoclasm in Byzantine art, this image became more widely used, possibly developing from an earlier type where the Virgin's right hand was on Christ's knee.Maria Vasilakƒì, p.196 An example of this earlier type is the Salus Populi Romani icon in Rome. Many versions carry the inscription \\"Hodegetria\\" in the background and in the Byzantine context \\"only these named versions were understood by their medieval audience as conscious copies of the original Hodegetria in the Hodegon monastery\\", according to Maria Vasilakƒì.Vasilakƒì; op and page cit Full-length versions, both probably made by Greek artists, appear in mosaic in Torcello Cathedral (12th century) and the Cappella Palatina, Palermo (c. 1150), this last with the \\"Hodegetria\\" inscription.James Hall, A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art, p.126, 1983, John Murray, London, From the Hodegetria developed the Panagia Eleousa (Virgin of Tender Mercy), where Mary still indicates Christ, but he is nuzzling her cheek, which she slightly inclines towards him; famous versions include the Theotokos of Vladimir and the Theotokos of St. Theodore. Usually Christ is on the left in these images. Hodegetria of Smolensk The shrine of the Hodegetria in Smolensk, as photographed by Prokudin-Gorsky in 1912. Some Russians, however, believe that after the fall of Constantinople, St. Luke's icon surfaced in Russia, where it was placed in the Assumption Cathedral in Smolensk, Russia. On several occasions, it was brought with great ceremony to Moscow, where the Novodevichy Convent was built in her honour. Her feast day is August 10. This icon, dated by art historians to the 11th century, is believed to have been destroyed by fire during the German occupation of Smolensk in 1941. A number of churches all over Russia are dedicated to the Smolensk Hodegetria, e.g., the Smolensky Cemetery Church in St. Petersburg and the Odigitrievsky Cathedral in Ulan-Ude. They may refer to the Theotokos as \\"Our Lady of Smolensk.\\" Italian tradition An Italian tradition relates that the original icon of Mary attributed to Luke, sent by Eudocia to Pulcheria from Palestine, was a large circular icon only of her head. When the icon arrived in Constantinople, it was fitted in as the head in a very large rectangular icon of Mary holding the Christ child; it is this composite icon that became the one historically known as the Hodegetria. Another tradition states that when the last Latin Emperor of Constantinople, Baldwin II, fled Constantinople in 1261, he took this original circular portion of the icon with him. It remained in the possession of the Angevin dynasty, who likewise had it inserted into a larger image of Mary and the Christ child, which is presently enshrined above the high altar of the Benedictine Abbey church of Montevergine. Unfortunately, over the centuries this icon has been subjected to repeated repainting, so that it is difficult to determine what the original image of Mary‚Äôs face would have looked like. However, Guarducci also claims that in 1950 an ancient image of Mary at the Church of Santa Francesca Romana was determined to be a very exact, but reverse mirror image of the original circular icon that was made in the 5th century and brought to Rome, where it has remained until the present.Margherita Guarducci, The Primacy of the Church of Rome. San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 1991, 93-101. An Italian \\"original\\" icon of the Hodegetria in Rome features in the crime novel Death and Restoration (1996) by Iain Pears, in the Jonathan Argyll series of art history mysteries.

In 1859, he left to join the Royal Irish Constabulary. In 1879 he became a resident magistrate in County Mayo and in 1883 was appointed Chief Commissioner of the Dublin Metropolitan Police. Although himself a Protestant, he had good relations with the Roman Catholic Church and was a member of several bodies which worked to relieve the poverty of the Irish peasantry. In 1893, Harrel was appointed Under-Secretary for Ireland, a post he held until 1902, when he retired due to ill-health. He continued to sit on many tribunals and voluntary bodies. Harrel was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1895, Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in 1900, and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE).

It is a bowed chordophone that was traditionally used to be played with the batuque dances. The cimboa is composedCardoso, Pedro (1933) Fernandes, A. N. (1969) of the instrument proper and its bow. The instrument belongs to the lute family, and so it possesses a neck attached to a sound box. The sound boxNogueira G. (2007) is made of a calebash, or when it is hard to find, with a coconut shell, with a soundboard of stretched kid skin, fixed with reed pieces. Attached to the sound box there is a neck made of flexible wood (pine). At the end of the neck is a tuning peg of mahogany to tune the sole string of the instrument which is stretched between the nut set in the neck, and the bridge placed on the soundboard. The bow is made of a curved wood (called barnelo in Cape Verde) piece and strung with horse mane. Sound is produced by rubbing the bow on the instrument's string, which is also made of horse mane. The pitch of the notes is changed by pressing the string against several points on the neck. The neck's flexibility allows bending effects of the notes by bending the neck. The exact origin of this instrument unknown, but it may be from continental Africa. Researchers have notedGon√ßalves, C. F. (2006) a resemblance between the cimboa and several African instruments, such as the kiki of the Teda and the Daza of the Tibesti and Borku, the nini of the Zaghawa, the fini of the Kanembu, and still the kiki of the Maba of the Ouadda√Ø region. The usage of this instrument is considered extinct. In spite of having revivals of its construction, nowadays it is used more as a decorative piece, rather than a musical instrument.

It is part of a larger sports club with some 1,500 members in departments for aikido, judo, cheerleading, fitness and dance, gymnastics, handball, roller hockey, volleyball, and water gymnastics. History The club was founded 11 April 1903 as Hammer FC and was joined in July 1912 by the membership of Gymnasialer FC Hamm which had been established 25 February 1903. In 1919, following World War I, the club merged with Hammer Turnverein 1859 to form TuS 1859/1903 Hamm. That union lasted only until 1922, when FC found a new partner in Hammer Sportverein 1904 to create Hammer SpVgg 03/04. The combined side soon began to enjoy some success in play in the regional top flight Rheinisch Westf√§lischer Spielverband. The club earned a second-place finish in 1929 and a divisional title in 1932. Generally a lower division local side throughout its history, the club rose as high as third division play with a single season appearance in the Regionalliga West in 1966‚Äì67. After competing in the Verbandsliga Westfalen (IV-V) through the late-60s and the 70s Hamm won its way through to the Oberliga Westfalen (IV) in 1980 where they played there as a lower table side until being relegated in 1990. The club made German Cup appearances in 1980‚Äì81 and 1982‚Äì83, on both occasions advancing to the second round before going out.

Friday October 14, 2011. Retrieved on October 20, 2011. In 2018, the department said it needed an additional $281 million in its 2020 budget to provide the required minimum amount of health care. To save money, the department rarely provides prisoners dentures, finding it cheaper to simply produce a blended diet in such cases. As of 2017, 2.3 million incarcerated Americans depend on prisons for their healthcare. These incarcerated individuals face limited access to medical exams and prescriptions medications compared to the general population as they are not eligible for Medicaid while incarcerated. On top of that, inmates face fees for seeking medical treatment. In 35 states, inmates have medical co-payments which come out of their commissary accounts (made up of prison job payments and contributions from their family). The copays are enforced to prevent inmates from abusing the healthcare system, however, it becomes a burden on inmates whose job makes little to no money and can become a financial strain on the family.  Private Healthcare in Public Facilities  In some prisons, the healthcare is private which can drastically change how inmates are treated. As of 2012, more than 20 states switched over to private health care providers in order to cut back on costs. These states don't have to provide benefits and pension costs to state workers, since they are hiring private companies, which significantly reduces the price they pay. However, this calls into question the quality of care inmates receive and many human rights groups in addition to federal judges are investigating these private companies.  Private Healthcare in Private Facilities  The two largest private prison companies, CoreCivic (formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America) and the CEO Group, run over 170 correctional facilities. In Texas, they have five facilities. These companies keep their operating costs low by using less dollars than allocated per inmate, especially in the area of Healthcare. Additionally, these companies and similar ones, avoid taking inmates over 65 or with chronic illnesses. When they can't avoid it, they improvise ways to make it hard for the inmate to receive medical care. Specifically, CoreCivic has a history of denying hospital requests and punishing inmates when they make repeated requests. Additionally, the records of private prisons are not subject to public access laws. For these reasons, access to health care in private prisons is something that must require more scrutiny. Requesting Care Requesting care in prison systems involves a simple procedural checklist that must be met in order to see any type of medical professional. Firstly, an incarnated person must fill out Sick Call Request form that should be answered within a 48-hour time period. After 48 hours, If there is no response, the person is to advance to fill out an I-60 form which states general issues faced. If the process continues to yield no approval, a Step 1 Grievance is to filled out. This level of documentation is very strictly reviewed. Continuing to hear no response for an extended period of time indicates the time to advance to a Step 2 Grievance. After these options, the prisoner may now file a lawsuit for ‚Äòexhausting administrative remedies.‚Äô A Sick Call Request form is a specified form that is specific towards what was wrong with the inmate medically. The progression to an I-60 form leads to a more generalized form that addresses seeing a doctor, contact visit, address changes and the like. A Step 1 Grievance are very strict and viewed very critically with certain guide-lines such as: only one problem can be addressed per grievance, only one grievance per week, must be reported within 15 days, and must be written with proper language. This form alone may take up to 40 days to be processed. A Step 2 Grievance is directly reviewed by TDCJ health committee and will have a response by 35 days. If these options are still not satisfactory, the inmate is then allowed to file a lawsuit because he/she has \\"exhausted administrative remedies.\\" Care through these methods is possible but is still a timely cost. Depending on how the prisoner is, the time between signing a form and receiving medication can mean life or death. Even though there is a defined process for requesting medical care in prison systems, the prisoner is still trying to fill out theses forms while considered ‚Äòsick.‚Äô Along with this, the prisoners are expected to cover the costs associated with filing out these expensive papers. For the first healthcare visit in a year, an inmate will be charged one-hundred dollars to their trust fund. However, there are still instances where the inmate would not have to attend to cost of care such as chronic illnesses, follow-up visits, emergency treatments, etc. Most visits to a medical professional costs inmates $2‚Äì8, in which they use they copay to relief these costs. At first, this rate sounds not too harsh but an important factor to put in is how much inmates earn. For most inmates, a wage is consistent of maybe a few cents per hour. This small set could mean that it would take an inmate a very long time before a \\"checkup\\" can be \\"bought\\". Fortunately though, care is not restricted if one does not have the necessary funds. Additionally, University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) decided that the easiest and most cost-effective way to dole out prescription medications to inmates was to distribute it from their own pharmacy. This pharmacy is based in an unmarked building in Huntsville, TX and serves 130 facilities throughout the state, including juvenile facilities, by filling over 20,000 prescriptions per day. Orders are sent out through an electronic medical record system and are processed with custom made conveyor belts and automated machines. The pharmacy has a 24-hour next-business-day turnaround ensuring medications can get to inmates as soon as possible. =History of Healthcare= Healthcare in Texas was mostly straight forward. Not much of it was changed over time due to its simplicity. One aspect that did change was how the cost of healthcare for incarcerated persons fluctuated. An issue that was prominent in prison systems was the associated costs with treatment. For this reason, the Correctional Managed Health Care Committee (CMHCC) was established in 1993. This committee focused their attention to the rising costs of healthcare today and how that effects inmates inside custody. The CMHCC hopes to open a statewide managed health care plan giving offenders the ability to afford care with timely access. = Mental Health = The decline of mental health treatment within detainees has become a major concern in the prison system, especially in the Texas prison departments. While the Texas Department of Criminal Justice claims that most of its facilities are capable of treating mental health issues, this does not seem to be the case. Texas provides at least 20% of inmates mental health treatment and this small percentage could be explained by the shortage of volunteers and staff to provide these mental treatments. There is also failure to recognize mental symptoms and make a correct diagnosis for these detainees. Lack of mental aid has increased serious assaults and violent behaviors in which most of these cases have been declined by the Bureau of Prisons for ‚Äúprivacy reasons.‚Äù Policies have been changed by the Bureau of Prisons to increase check-ins by once a month or weekly. However, the TDCJ has attempted to minimize these issues as best as it can. Detainees are offered guidelines on how to manage their stress and sanity before being released to the public. In terms of support and care, there is the Offender Grievance Program that allows offenders to communicate with faculty staff about questions, regards, or concerns associating with their sentence. In addition, the TDCJ Ombudsman Program makes referrals to an agency staff to help resolve problems and answer questions regarding a specific offender. The Peer Recovery Support Services hold classes to allow prisoners to help one another recover from their issues. Those that obtain a certificate from the program are eligible to work or volunteer as a Peer Recovery Support Specialist. This further build a community-based environment where prisoners can understand each other's mistakes and problems and cooperate as a team to provide solutions to better themselves. Specific programs are held for detainees that are of a particular background and history. The Chaplaincy Program is a nondiscriminatory program that permits prisoners to pursue their religious faiths, reconcile relationships, and strengthen families. The program offers mentoring, space for spiritual growth, pastoral care, life skill classes, accountability/support groups, etc. Similarly, the ‚ÄúInnerChange‚Äù Faith-Based- Pre-Release Program functions in the same way as the Chaplaincy Program to further help detainees recover well. For younger offenders, the Youthful Offender Program aids young offenders with special needs to the Mentally Retarded Offenders Program (MROP) or Physically Hanicapped Offenders Program (PHOP). Regular youth offenders are placed in interdisciplinary programming established on a weekly schedule, including: * education * social skills training * anger management * values development * goal setting * cognitive restructuring * substance abuse education * conflict resolution * aggression replacement * and life skills. = Recreation and Fitness = Leisure activities are meant for enhancing potential life skills post-release and allowing inmates an opportunity to complete one or two activities of their choice. In terms of recreation and fitness, inmates have the chance to participate in structured fitness sessions that offer regular and moderate levels of exercises monitored by staff. Staff members are to take into account the kind of activity the detainee wants to do, the amount of time spent on that activity, and given permission. These fitness sessions occur in the ‚ÄúBig Yard,‚Äù where gym equipment is stored and common past time favorites are held, such as volleyball, baseball, softball, wrestling, basketball, tennis, handball, boxing, and soccer/futbol. The yard is surrounded by a barbed-wire fence for extra supervision. During a detainee's time in prison, they are given a physical assessment that focuses on cardiovascular endurance, flexibility, body fat percentage, and dynamic strength. To further sharpen community-building skills, inmates are eligible to run special fitness and health events, including: * Run/Walk Marathons * Health fairs; health book fairs * Nationally recognized health events In addition to these health events, inmates have the opportunity to educate themselves in other health and sanity organizations. Staff will provide discussions concentrating on: * Weight management * Stress management * Human anatomy * Aerobic exercises * Smoking cessation * Back pain relief * Nutrition Ultimately, prisoners are able to utilize these resources to make them better returning members of society.

A 2018 report by the Texas Criminal Justice Coalition stated that women in the TDCJ have fewer career-training and employment programs available than men; women had only two certification programs, while men had 21. In 2019, the Texas Senate passed a bill, allowing inmates to have access to a greater variety of feminine hygiene products. They have access to various sized tampons and pads and can receive up to 10 free products per day. =Texas Prison Nurseries= There is currently no standard policy for what happens when a woman gives birth while incarcerated, because only recently have states begun to ban the shackling of pregnant women during active labor and childbirth. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice has created an initiative in collaboration with the University of Texas Medical Branch, called BAMBI (Baby and Mother Bonding Initiative). Within this program, eligible offenders will be provided with an opportunity to bond and form attachments, \\"...which is important to healthy growth and development, socialization, and psychological development during the infant‚Äôs formative years, while in a safe and secure environment.\\" However, all mothers within this program are only allowed to remain in it for 12 months. After this period they must have completed their sentence, and be prepared to transition back into society. The University of Texas Medical Branch found through their research with the BAMBI program that, \\"As the number of women giving birth in prisons continues to trend upward, the need for more programs to promote [the] best outcomes for both mother and infants is crucial.\\" On average, about 250 babies are born to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. The Santa Maria Hostel provides a residential setting for these mothers and their infants. However, compared to other states, Texas' prison nursery system is limited in accessibility to mothers and infants. Texas has one of the highest populations within its prisons, but resources to women and their infants is still limited. On September 1, 2009, two laws were passed in the 81st Texas legislature. One prohibited the use of restraints on female prisoners during childbirth. The other asked that the counties write and implement procedures in regards to the health of their pregnant inmate population. Another law was passed in 2019 that stipulated that pregnant inmates cannot be shackled at all during their pregnancy or when they are recovering after childbirth. As there is no set policy for how long a mother can remain with her infant after birth, the other proposal that has yet to be passed would allow 72 hours of bonding time if the inmate does not qualify for the BAMBI program. Also, it mandates more formal training for officers to protect the physical and mental safety of pregnant inmates. Prison nurseries are imperative for both the wellbeing of the child and the mother. The CDC reported that infant mortality rates for \\"...babies separated from their incarcerated mothers is 7.9 infant deaths per 1,000 live births for Hispanic inmates and 14.3 for Black inmates. By comparison, the national infant mortality rate is 5.96 deaths per 1,000 live births.\\" Thus, there is also a racial component to the treatment of pregnant women within the Texas prison. This may have to do with the fact that Texas prison healthcare does not offer screenings and treatments for high-risk pregnancies. They also lack resources to implement policy to give expectant mothers advice on nutrition, activity level, and safety. In addition, records of pregnancies and deliveries do not have to be written, and thus this could be another factor to explain the higher infant mortality. Unfortunately, in the general population within Texas, black non-Hispanics families were disproportionately affected by infant mortality. The prison trend follows the societal trend of infant mortality, which shows that there are disparities both within the prison system and the general population in terms of healthcare and preventative care.

In August 2011 Whitmire told the Austin American Statesman that he would bring up the idea of moving the TDCJ headquarters to Austin during the next legislative session. Whitmire argued that while a Huntsville headquarters made sense when all of the prison units were in east and south Texas, since the TDCJ now has facilities around the entire state, the TDCJ headquarters should be consolidated in Austin.

The distance to this galaxy remains elusive, with measurements ranging from up to . This galaxy forms a member of the NGC 1566 subgroup of the Dorado Group, of which it is dominant and brightest member (although Kilbornetal and colleagues (2005) listed it as second brightest member of the NGC 1566 group after NGC 1553). The X-ray emission from the group is dominated by the hot gas halo of this galaxy, which extends out to before merging with the background radiation. The galaxy appears to be interacting with smaller members of its subgroup. Radio emissions suggest the disk is asymmetrical and the neutral hydrogen gas shows a mild warp.

It's located in Ko≈õciuszko Park, where it was moved in 1938 from the village Syrynia, where it was originally constructed in 1510. It is under the invocation of St. Michael. It has end-fitted log framework construction and shingled roof. Free-standing belltower was completed before 1679; it has historic lych-gate and wooden fence around the churchyard. History The church of St. Michael Archangel was first built in 1305 in Syrynia, near Wodzis≈Çaw ≈ölƒÖski. At that time it had a defensive purpose; it was used by the people living in the village as a place where they could hide in, in a case of an attack. The free-standing bell tower was used as a watch tower. The church, in the form and size it is now, was built in 1510. In the 17th century a new free standing tower was built but it was replaced by the present one in 1853. In 1913 the German Kaiser, Wilhelm II, visited the church and, reportedly, admired the beauty of the church very much. In the years 1938-1939 the church was transported to Kosciuszko Park. This was a part of a bigger project before World War II, which was to create a heritage park with examples of traditional Silesian architecture. Along with the church, a 17th-century granary from Go≈Çkowice was also moved to Kosciuszko Park. Unfortunately it was burned in a fire in 1969. The fire did not spread and the church, belfry and the fence around were not affected. After World War II broke out, the German occupant did not allow for the church to be opened and used for services. Towards the end of the War, bunkers and trenches were built nearby the church, however in 1945 the front line moved and the church survived. In the post-war years and after changes in the political situation in Poland, the church was for a few years forgotten and neglected. There was even an idea that the church should be moved again, this time to a park in Pszczyna. However the opinion of the specialists was such that the technical state of the church building does not allow the church to be transported. After political changes in 1956 the situation of the church started to improve. The church was blessed for the third time and started to be used for services. The church also required immediate care and repair. In 1981 a new parish of St. Michael Archangel was created. Most of the paintings that were still on the walls in 1930‚Äôs, were washed of before the church was moved to Katowice. Many of the pieces of architectural fittings are relatively new however there are things that are much older; an example could be a baroque ambo.

It is located at one end of the Senado Square in S√£o Louren√ßo, Macau, China. The title was bestowed on Macau's government in 1810 by Portugal's Prince Regent Jo√£o, who later became King John VI of Portugal. This was a reward for Macau's loyalty to Portugal, which refused to recognise Spain‚Äôs sovereignty during the Philippine Dynasty that it occupied Portugal, between 1580 and 1640. A plaque ordered by the king commemorating this can still be seen inside the entrance hall. It currently houses Macau's Municipal Affairs Bureau. History A Chinese-style Pavilion used to stand on the site of Leal Senado building. That building was then a meeting place for the Portuguese and the Chinese officials, and where the Ming dynasty government would announce regulations to Macau. The Portuguese planned to buy the pavilion as early as 1583, as well as some Chinese houses behind it. However, it wasn't until 1784 that the Portuguese government finally purchased it at a price of 80,000 taels. The Leal Senado building itself was built after the purchase, and became the center of Macau's politics since then. Portuguese rallies and celebrations were also held here. Although built in 1784, it was in a style similar to plain style from 14th- to 15th-century Portugal than the Pombaline style that was popular at the time when the Leal Senado was built. A number of institutions were affiliated to the building, including a museum of Lu√≠s Vaz de Cam√µes, a post office, a court and a prison, yet all had moved elsewhere. It was completely refurbished in 1904. In 1936 the building was damaged again by another typhoon. After the handover of Macau to China in 1999 it became the headquarters of the Civic and Municipal Affairs Bureau. It became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Historic Centre of Macau in 2005. Features The building is U-shaped. The right part of the first floor of the building features an exhibition hall, hosting art exhibitions on a regular basis. The convention hall is on the second floor, where the public meetings and press conferences of the former Macau Municipal Council and the current Institute of Civic and Municipal Affairs are held. A public library, opened in 1929, is located at the Northwestern part of the first floor. It is blueprinted after the library of Mafra Convent in Portugal, decorated in classical style. It contains around 18,500 books and specialises in collecting foreign language books in dating from 17th century to the 1950s, in particular those of Portuguese history in Africa and the Far East. The building has retained all its original master walls and primary layout, including the courtyard garden in the back.

Roman London  Using bioarchaeology, DNA analysis and the examination of grave goods in Roman London have identified one woman from the southern Mediterranean that may have had black African ancestry who had both travelled to London during the Roman period.  16th century  Early in the 16th century, Africans arrived in London when Catherine of Aragon travelled to London and brought a group of her African attendants with her. Around the same time Africans named trumpeters, who served Henry VII and Henry VIII, came to London when trade lines began to open between London and West Africa. The first record of an African in London was in 1593. His name was Cornelius. London's residents started to become fearful of the increased black population. At this time Elizabeth I declared that black \\"Negroes and black Moors\\" were to be arrested and expelled from her kingdom, although this did not lead to any known legislation.  17th‚Äì18th centuries  During this era there was a small rise of black people arriving in London. Britain was involved with the tri-continental slave trade between Europe, Africa and the Americas. Black slaves were attendants to sea captains and ex-colonial officials as well as traders, plantation owners and military personnel. This marked growing evidence of the black presence in the northern, eastern and southern areas of London. There were also small numbers of free slaves and seaman from West Africa and South Asia. Many of these people were forced into beggary due to the lack of jobs and racial discrimination.Banton, Michael (1955), The Coloured Quarter. Jonathan Cape. London. There is evidence that black men and women were occasionally discriminated against when dealing with the law because of their skin colour. In 1737 George Scipio was accused of stealing Anne Godfrey's washing, the case rested entirely on whether or not Scipio was the only black man in Hackney at the time. Around the 1750s London became the home of many of Black people, Jews, Irish, Germans, and Huguenots. In 1764 The Gentleman's Magazine reported that there was \\"supposed to be near 20,000 Negroe servants\\". Evidence of the number of black residents in London has been found through registered burials. The people of London had widespread views that Black people in London were less than human; these views were expressed in slave sale advertisements. Leading black activists of this era included Olaudah Equiano, Ignatius Sancho and Quobna Ottobah Cugoano. With the support of other Britons these activists demanded that Blacks be freed from slavery. Supporters involved in this movements included workers and other nationalities of the urban poor. . At this time the slavery of whites was forbidden, but the legal statuses of these practices were not clearly defined. Free black slaves could not be enslaved, but Blacks who were brought as slaves to Britain were considered the property of their owners. During this era Lord Mansfield declared that a slave who fled from his master could not be taken by force or sold abroad, in the case of Somerset v Stewart. This verdict fuelled the numbers of Blacks that escaped slavery, and helped send slavery into decline. In this same period many slave soldiers who fought on the side of the British in the American Revolutionary War arrived in London. These soldiers were deprived of pensions and many of them became poverty-stricken and were reduced to begging on the streets. The Blacks in London lived among the whites in areas of Mile End, Stepney, Paddington and St Giles. The majority of these people did not live as slaves, but as servants to wealthy whites. Many became labeled as the \\"Black Poor\\" defined as former low-wage soldiers, seafarers and plantation workers. During the late 18th century there were many publications and memoirs written about the \\"black poor\\". One example is the writings of Equiano, who became an unofficial spokesman for Britain's Black community. A memoir about his life is entitled, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano. Equiano became a landowner in Cambridgeshire and married Susannah Cullen, from Soham. Both his daughters were born and baptised there. In 1787 4,000 Blacks were transported from London for resettlement to the colony of Sierra Leone with help from the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor.http://www.betterworldbooks.com/african-americans-in-the-american- revolution-id-1155512723.aspx  19th century  Coming into the early 19th century, more groups of black soldiers and seaman were displaced after the Napoleonic wars and some settled in London. These settlers suffered and faced many challenges as did many black people in London. The slave trade was abolished completely in the British empire by 1834. The number of blacks in London was steadily declining with these new laws. Fewer blacks were brought into London from the West Indies and parts of Africa. During the mid-19th century there were restrictions on African immigration. In the later part of the 19th century there was a buildup of small groups of black dockside communities in towns such as Canning Town,Geoffrey Bell, The other Eastenders : Kamal Chunchie and West Ham's early black community (Stratford: Eastside Community Heritage, 2002) Liverpool, and Cardiff. This was a direct effect of new shipping links that were established with the Caribbean and West Africa. Despite social prejudice and racist discrimination in Victorian England, some 19th-century black people living in England achieved exceptional success. Pablo Fanque, born poor as William Darby in Norwich, rose to become the proprietor of one of Britain's most successful Victorian circuses. He is immortalised in the lyrics of The Beatles song \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" Another famous black Briton was William Davison, a conspirator executed in London for his role in the Cato Street Conspiracy against Lord Liverpool's government in 1820. Britain's first black High Sheriff was Nathaniel Wells, the son of a slave from St Kitts and a slave trader. After his father's death he was freed and inherited a fortune. He moved to Monmouthshire's Piercefield House and became Sheriff of Monmouthshire in 1818. One of the leaders in 19th- century chartism was William Cuffay, who was born on a merchant ship in the West Indies in 1788, and whose father, had been a slave in St Kitts. 20th century One of the black Londoners, Learie Constantine, a cricketer from Trinidad and welfare officer in the RAF, was refused service at a London hotel. He stood up for his rights and later was awarded compensation. That particular example is used by some to illustrate the slow change from racism towards acceptance and equality of all citizens in London. = Post-war period = In 1950, it was estimated there were no more than 20,000 non-White residents in the United Kingdom, mainly in England; almost all born overseas. Just after the end of World War II, the first groups of post-war Caribbean immigrants started to emigrate and settle in London. There were an estimated 492 that were passengers on the that arrived at Tilbury Docks on 22 June 1948. These passengers settled in the area of Brixton which is now a prominently Black district in Britain. From the 1950s into the 1960s, there was a mass migration of workers from all over the English-speaking Caribbean, particularly Jamaica; who settled in the UK. These immigrants were invited to fill labour requirements in London's hospitals, transportation venues and railway development. There was a continuous influx of African students, sportsmen, and businessmen mixed within British society . They are widely viewed as having been a major contributing factor to the rebuilding of the post-war urban London economy. In 1962, the Commonwealth Immigrants Act was passed in the UK along with a succession of other laws in 1968, 1971, and 1981 that severely restricted the entry of Black Caribbean immigrants into the United Kingdom. In 1975, a new voice emerged for the Black population of London; his name was David Pitt and he brought a new voice to the House of Lords. He spoke against racism and for equality in regards to all residents of Britain. At the 1987 general election, the first-ever Black British MPs were elected to the House of Commons; Diane Abbott for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, Bernie Grant for Tottenham and Paul Boateng for Brent South. All were candidates from the Labour Party, and out of these three people; Abbott holds the distinction of being the first Black British woman to be elected to the House of Commons and is also the only one to still be an MP to the present day, as Grant died in 2000 and Boateng stood down in 2005. By the end of the 20th century, the number of Black Londoners numbered half a million, according to the 1991 UK Census. An increasing number of these Black Londoners were London, or British-born. Even with this growing population and the first Blacks elected to the UK Parliament, many argue that there was still discrimination and a socio-economic imbalance in London among the Black community. In 1992, the number of Blacks in Parliament increased to six and in 1997, they increased their numbers to nine. There are still many problems that Black Londoners face; the new global and high-tech information revolution is changing the urban economy and some argue that it is driving unemployment rates among Blacks up relative to non-Blacks, something which, it is argued, threatens to erode the progress made thus far. As of June 2007, the Black population of London is 802,300, equivalent to 10.6% of the population of London; 4.3% of Londoners are Caribbean, 5.5% of Londoners are African and a further 0.8% are from other black backgrounds including American and Latin American. There are also 117,400 people who are mixed black and white.Resident Population Estimates by Ethnic Group, All Persons At the 2011 UK Census, the total Black population of London stood at 1,088,640 or 13.3% of the population.

Wellman went into the 2007‚Äì08 season hoping to help Marsaxlokk win more silverware, however the club found themselves victims of their own success, as many of the stars of the previous season left the club for pastures new, the likes of Daniel Bogdanovic, Justin Haber and Jamie Pace to name a few. This left the club short of talent, Stephen however stuck around and despite the club's loss of players, they still managed to record a very creditable 2nd-place finish in the Maltese Premier League, with Wellman making 21 appearances and even chipping in with two goals. The 2008‚Äì09 season proved to be Stephen's last with Marsaxlokk. The club had an extremely disappointing start to the season by their own high standards, and only managed to gain a place in the championship pool by beating Msida Saint-Joseph in the final game of the first round.

Early life and education Birchenough was born in Macclesfield, Cheshire, the second son of John Birchenough, a silk manufacturer. He was educated firstly at Strathmore House, Southport, then subsequently at the University of Oxford, University College, London (BA, 1873; MA, 1876). It was at University College London that he became close friends with Leonard Montefiore, the Jewish philanthropist. This friendship was described in the introduction to Montefiore's posthumous \\"Essays and Letters\\" as \\"the greatest friendship of his life- a friendship which was marred by no reserves and subject to no fluctuations but continued from its first commencement to Montefiore's death\\".Essays and Letters by Leonard A. Montefiore, in Memoriam, Page 10, Privately Printed. London 1881. Latterly Birchenough attended the √âcole Libre des Sciences Politiques, Paris. According to an obituary published by Reuters at the time of his death it was whilst at Paris that he \\"obtained a much wider and less insular view of national and international problems, particularly in regard to tariffs, than he could have got at that period in England.\\"Notable Work For the Empire; Reuters Wednesday March 12th 1937 Business In the mid-19th century, Macclesfield had a thriving silk industry, and Birchenough joined the family silk business, John Birchenough & Sons, as a partner with his father and two brothers, Walter Edwin Birchenough (the father of the Very Reverend Godwin Birchenough) and William Taylor Birchenough. The latter was married to Jane Peacock, daughter of Richard Peacock MP, the locomotive manufacturer. The Birchenoughs, who were Methodists, were a prominent business family in Macclesfield, and Henry's father, a Liberal, served as mayor of the town in 1876. In common with other silk manufacturing families in Macclesfield Henry Birchenough was engaged in supporting local charities and served variously as the chairman of the Technical School, the School of Art and the \\"Useful Knowledge Society\\" in Macclesfield.Sarah Jane Griffiths PHD Thesis Liverpool University 2006 Later in life whilst Chairman of the Beit Railway Trust, Birchenough supported Ruzawi School in Southern Rhodesia. The school named a large dormitory block the Birchenough Building in recognition of the work he had done on behalf of the school, particularly in the field of raising funds for the new buildings. As well as being a partner in the family silk business Birchenough was also a director of the Imperial Continental Gas Association and of British Exploration of Australia Ltd, and later served as president of the Macclesfield Chamber of Commerce.Volume 1 Tariff Commission Report, Steel industry and trade ‚Äì England; Textile industry and fabrics, London, 1904 Birchenough became a close friend of Alfred Milner, the future Lord Milner, and the two shared lodgings in London prior to Birchenough's marriage.The Anglo-American Establishment Caroll Quigley 1981 Their friendship was to endure until Milner's death. Birchenough was a member of the Reform Club, Brooks's,Burke's genealogical and heraldic history of the peerage, baronetage and knightage 1914 page 2172 the Ranelagh, and the City of London Club and served as Upper Bailiff for the Worshipful Company of Weavers from 1934-1935. He was also a member of council for the Royal Statistical Society,Who's Who of Southern Africa, 1911 and a councillor for the Royal Colonial Institute. Birchenough was also a Fellow of both the Royal Empire Society and the Royal Geographical Society. Suffragists and women in society On 24 March 1877, at the age of 24, having completed his MA, Birchenough appeared alongside Lydia Becker, Alice Cliff Scatcherd (subsequently one of the co-founders of the Women's Franchise League) and other early suffragists to discuss women's access to the vote in Macclesfield. The chairman, J. W. White, addressed the meeting saying that \\"it appeared somewhat strange that whereas the British Parliament had been engaged from time to time for many years back in conferring rights and removing disabilities, there should still exist any large and intelligent section of society outside the electoral community. They had not yet found any good reason given for excluding from parliamentary suffrage women who had already voted in municipal and school board elections; therefore they intended to reiterate their demands until they were conceded\\". Birchenough and Scatcherd seconded the first resolution, which was moved by Joshua Oldfield Nicholson. In the same year he is recorded as having given two pounds and two shillings to the Manchester National Society for Women's Suffrage. Birchenough‚Äôs immediate family retained links to early women's rights activists and Emily Faithfull served as witness to the marriage of Birchenough‚Äôs brother William Taylor Birchenough. In her book Three Visits to America, Faithfull writes the following about the Birchenough silk mills: \\"No one could desire to see women looking more healthy than the operatives in some of our factories in Manchester, Bradford, and Halifax. I shall long remember going through Messrs. Birchenough's silk mills at Macclesfield. Certainly the occasion was an exceptional one. The eldest son had been married the day before, and the entire place had been decorated by the operatives to commemorate the event. The walls were adorned by appropriate mottoes, even unique representations of the bridal ceremony had been devised, and everything betokened the happy understanding existing there between labor and capital. \\" In 1905, Birchenough became a member of the industrial committee of the Victoria League, an Edwardian imperialist women's organisation. Founders of the Victoria League included Violet Markham, Edith Lyttelton, and Violet Cecil. After the death of her husband, Lord Edward Cecil, in 1918, the latter subsequently married Birchenough's friend Lord Alfred Milner in 1921. Southern and East Africa After the South African War, and at the suggestion of Lord Milner, the British Government sent Birchenough to South Africa as Special Trade Commissioner in 1903 to enquire into prospects for British trade in the country in the aftermath of the war. According to a November 1903 New York Times article, Birchenough was optimistic about the revival of business opportunities for Britain in the country. In South Africa, he also undertook a study of the activities of Britain's main trade rivals, identifying the United States and Germany as being the main competitors in the country. Birchenough also laid out a number of suggestions to be considered to increase the United Kingdom's competitive edge; these and the rest of his report were incorporated into a Blue Book. For this work, he was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1905 Birthday Honours. He became a director of the British South Africa Company in 1905 and soon became prominent in the company, being appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 1916 Birthday Honours for services to Rhodesia. He became president of the BSAC in 1925 and held the post until his death. He was appointed chairman of the Rhodesia Railway Company and the Mashonaland Railway Company in 1925 after the death of James Rochfort Maguire and retained the position until his own death.Biography, Who Was Who He was a Director of the Victoria Falls Power Company and the African Concessions Syndicate.The Anglo-African Who's Who and Biographical Sketchbook, 1907 He was also a director of the Rhodesian Anglo American Corporation Ltd under the chairmanship of Ernest Oppenheimer. Surviving correspondence by Birchenough concerning BSAC affairs with Philip Lyttelton Gell and Alfred Lord Milner is to be found in the papers of the Gell family of Hopton Hall, in the Derbyshire Record Office and in the Alfred Milner, Viscount Milner papers at the Bodleian Library. In 1924 he was appointed a seat on the East Africa Commission, otherwise known as the Southborough Committee chaired by Francis Hopwood, 1st Baron Southborough. The committee had several tasks including investigating measures to accelerate economic development and coordinate policy and improve health and economic development for the population across several countries in the region. The remit covered Kenya, Uganda, Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland and Tanganyika.Government Notice 280, Kenya Gazette August 1924 Birchenough was also chairman of the Beit Railway Trust from 1931 until 1937. In 1932 he presented a grant of ¬£50,000 from the Beit Trust to the fledgling Department of Civil Aviation in Colonial era Zimbabwe. In presenting the grant he stated that the trustees has agreed to set aside this sum for two years commencing in 1933 to improve ground services along the Imperial Airways route in the country. In the same year Imperial Airways (Africa) Ltd had just inaugurated a mail and passenger service to England. By 1935 the Rhodesia and Nyasaland Airways (RANA) was providing a regular mail and passenger service to Mozambique, Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia. The Beit Railway Trust, Rhodesia Railway Company and Imperial Airways all had interests in RANACivil Aviation in Colonial Zimbabwe 1912-1980, AS Mlambo, Department of Economic History, University of Zimbabwe which was itself subsequently incorporated into Central African Airways in 1946. After his death, Henry Birchenough's ashes were interred in a pillar of the Birchenough Bridge, which had been constructed with the support of the Beit Trust and which spans the Save River in Zimbabwe. He was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in the 1935 Birthday Honours for services to the British South Africa Company and the Beit Trust. Contributions to contemporary imperial discourse Already in the late 1870s Birchenough had shown an interest in social issues concerning women's rights and in 1886 he addressed Macclesfield's Townley Street Mutual Improvement Society with a lecture titled: \\"The Making of Greater Britain\\" in which he sought to explain the origins of Britain's empire and to remind the audience of the responsibilities that this entailed.Evolution and the Victorians: Science, Culture and Politics in Darwin's Britain, P129, Jonathan Conlin, Bloomsbury, 2014 Birchenough became close friends with Alfred Milner though an introduction by Leonard Montefiore around 1881;Letter A Milner to Philip Lyttelton Gell, September 28th 1881, Hotel Bar au Lac, Zurich, Derbyshire Record Office, Ref: D3287 MIL/1/104 this friendship was to endure until Milner's death. Milner was best man at Birchenough's marriage in 1886 and prior to this the two of them shared chambers in London. Together with Milner, Birchenough was a member of the Coefficients dining club, founded at a dinner given by Sidney and Beatrice Webb in September 1902, and which was a forum for the meeting of British socialist reformers, Tories and imperialists of the Edwardian era. Divisions within the club over the issue of Tariff Reform following Joseph Chamberlain's resignation as Secretary of State for the Colonies and the increasing dominance of the pro-Unionist membership, which favoured Chamberlain and his tariff reform policies, contributed to the club's dissolution in 1909. Birchenough held Liberal Unionist views and published an article entitled \\"Mr Chamberlain as an Empire Builder\\", in the periodical Nineteenth Century and After in 1902. Birchenough also contributed to two compilations of essays and lectures in the pre-First World War period regarding imperial thinking. These included The Empire and the Century: A Series of Essays on Imperial Problems and Possibilities, published in 1905 by John Murray. In 1911, he contributed to \\"The British Dominions\\", a lecture tour at Birmingham University in the winter of 1910‚Äì1911. The lectures were subsequently edited by William Ashley, the economic historian, and published by Longmans Green and Co in 1911. Tariff Commission In 1902 Birchenough wrote an article titled \\"Preferential Tariffs within The Empire ‚Äì A Reply to Sir Robert Giffen\\", in the periodical, Nineteenth Century and After. Two years later after his return from South Africa he became a member of the committee set up under the auspices of the Tariff Reform League by Joseph Chamberlain that produced the Tariff Commission report on the steel industry and trade, and the textile industry and fabrics. Government committees In 1906, he was appointed to the Royal Commission on Shipping Rings, and was also a member of the Advisory Committee to the Board of Trade. He worked with the Board of Trade during the First World War, chairing the After the War Textiles Committee from 1916, the Royal Commission on Paper from 1917, and the Committee on Cotton Growing in the Empire from 1917, and sitting on the Central Committee of Materials Supply and the Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy under Lord Balfour of Burleigh from 1916. From 1918 he chaired the Advisory Council to the Ministry of Reconstruction. In 1919, under the chairmanship of Birchenough, the Advisory Council to the Ministry of Reconstruction produced the Report of the Committee of ChairmenViscount Haldane, Sir Archibald Williamson and Sir Charles Parsons on Electric Power Supply. The committee were asked to submit general comments or suggestions on the broad administrative and commercial issues arising out of the Williamson Report which had been produced by the Electric Power Supply Committee in 1917. The Birchenough Committee generally agreed with the Williamson Report but recommended that generation and transmission should be a single unified system with a state regulation and finance and that means should be found for including distribution as well. This recommendation was very far-sighted but considered too ambitious for general acceptance at the time and was ignored. If acted upon it would have anticipated the Electricity Act 1947 by twenty-eight years.The Transmission of Electricity in England and Wales; land use and amenities, Goulty, George A, PHD thesis, Durham University 1969 The Electricity (Supply) Act 1919, was based essentially on the Williamson and Birchenough reports and introduced central co-ordination by establishing the Electricity Commissioners, an official body responsible for securing reorganisation on a regional basis.\\"Electricity Supply in the UK: A chronology\\"The Electricity Council, 1987, Birchenough was also a government director of the British Dyestuffs Corporation. For these war services, in the 1920 New Year Honours, he was created a baronet of Macclesfield in the County of Chester on 4 February 1920 . The Patriotic Association of Macclesfield and the National Service League In 1900, Birchenough joined with Thomas Coglan Horsfall to instigate the Patriotic Association of Macclesfield, which was envisaged as a feeder for the local Volunteer Force.Sarah Jane Griffiths PHD Thesis Liverpool University 2006 Charitable work of the Macclesfield silk manufacturers, 1750‚Äì1900 Subsequently, he became president of the Association whilst Horsfall became treasurer. In early 1902, the National Service League was formed in London. Birchenough sat on the executive committee of the League. Progressing with the same theme, in July 1904 Birchenough published an article in the Nineteenth Century and After entitled \\"Compulsory Education and Compulsory Military Training\\", where he linked compulsory military training with the need for creating national efficiency. The First World War and the conscription debate In 1915, Birchenough was a signatory with a number of other \\"distinguished men of all parties\\" including Admiral Lord Charles Beresford of a manifesto which appeared in the Morning Post calling for a \\"complete and organised effort to carry on the war requiring all men to either fight or be available for national service at home\\".Matthew Hendley PHD University of Toronto 1998, Patriotic Leagues and the Evolution of Popular Patriotism and Imperialism in Great Britain 1914‚Äì1932 The manifesto followed a series of letters which had appeared in the Morning Post and attracted support from diverse figures including Neville Chamberlain, Sir H. Rider Haggard, and Lord Northcliffe. Subsequently, the Morning Post included further signatories to the manifesto. The manifesto did undermine the legitimacy of the National Service League which decided not to actively participate in the manifesto campaign. Family Henry Birchenough married Mabel Charlotte, third daughter of George Granville Bradley, Dean of Westminster in December 1886. Alfred Milner was best man. Mabel, like her sister Margaret,Martha S. Vogeler, 'Woods , Margaret Louisa (1855‚Äì1945)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 was a writer and the author of The Popular Guide to Westminster Abbey (1885), Disturbing Elements (1896), Potsherds (1898), and Private Bobs and the New Recruit (1901). One of Birchenough's nephews, William Taylor Birchenough (son of William Taylor Birchenough of Gawsworth Hall), played in the famous Eton v. Harrow Fowler's match in 1910 and another, the Very Reverend Godwin Birchenough, became Dean of Ripon. Birchenough had two daughters, but no sons, and so the baronetcy became extinct on his death.

He was born in Port St Mary on the Isle of Man. Career Dale Lace came to South Africa as an employee of the Bank of Africa. Dale Lace built a fortune in the diamond industry. He would depart Kimberley for the Witwatersrand Goldfields. During 1895 until 1896, he was a member of the Johannesburg Reform Committee agitating for better rights for Uitlanders in the South African Republic. A consequence of this action resulted in the Jameson Raid and would accompany a British Agent with a message to the raiders expressing the Colonial Secretary's disapproval of the raid. When the raid failed, he was one of many of the Committee arrested, tried and found guilty but escaped jail with the payment of a ¬£2,000 fine. After the British victory in the Second Boer War, he was appointed as a Councillor on the first Johannesburg Town Council and he was among the founders of the Transvaal Political Association in Johannesburg in October 1902. The association later became the Transvaal Responsible Government Association, which worked for Responsible government until it was granted in 1906. He was also a founding member of the Wanderer's Club in Johannesburg. Family He was twice married to Josephine Cornelia Brink (Jos√©) from Richmond in the Karoo, who died 14 May 1937. He met and married Jos√© for the first time when she was in London pursuing an acting career. It is believed that she was proposed to by Cecil John Rhodes, prime minister of the Cape at the time, and was mistress to King Edward VII. It is known that she was mistress to another man Ernest Beckett, 2nd Baron Grimthorpe, with whom she had a son, although she claimed it was Edward VII's son. The second time, after Ernest Beckett declined to marry her, she and John married in Cape Town and John adopted her son. They never had children of their own. Josephine Dale Lace was a flamboyant Johannesburg socialite who was often seen in a carriage drawn by a team of zebras. The Dale Laces were owners of one of Johannesburg's most prominent historic landmarks, the Parktown mansion 'Northwards', designed by British architect Herbert Baker in 1904. Just as the gold-mining industry was booming, the diamond market was being monopolised by De Beers, which went on to become the world‚Äôs largest diamond company - the dissipation of the Dale Lace fortune coincided with a devastating fire at 'Northwards', and in 1912, the charred remains of the house were sold to George Albu.

A native of Massachusetts, he was a Union Army veteran of the American Civil War and attained the rank of major. After the war, he moved to Illinois, where he studied law and was admitted to the bar. He later moved to South Dakota and served as its first attorney general. Early life Dollard was born in Fall River, Massachusetts, on March 14, 1842, the son of Thomas Dollard and Mary (Collyer) Dollard. His mother died when he was two years old, and his father soon remarried. Dollard was raised by his father and stepmother Ann, and according to an 1855 state census, his siblings included an older sister named Mary and a younger half-sister named Elisabeth. Dollard was educated through the high school grades in the public schools of Fall River and Stoughton and by the time of the 1860 federal census, Mary and Robert Dollard were living in Easton, Massachusetts, where Mary worked in a thread factory and Robert was employed as a moulder. American Civil War On April 16, 1861, Dollard enlisted as a private in Company B, 4th Massachusetts Volunteer Militia. During the regiment's three months of Union Army service at the start of the American Civil War, it performed garrison duty at Fort Monroe and took part in the Battle of Big Bethel. The 4th Massachusetts Volunteers were mustered out in late July, and in September Dollard returned to service when he enlisted in Company E, 23rd Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He attained the rank of sergeant before receiving his commission as a second lieutenant, and he later received promotion to first lieutenant. The 23rd Massachusetts was part of Burnside's North Carolina Expedition, and engagements in which Dollard took part included the battles of Roanoke Island, New Bern, and Fort Macon. Following the North Carolina expedition, the 23rd Massachusetts was part of a Union force sent to South Carolina, where it performed occupation duty before returning to North Carolina to perform occupation duty there. In the summer of 1863, the 23rd Massachusetts left North Carolina and bivouacked at Fort Monroe, Virginia. Dollard left the 23rd Massachusetts in December 1863 for promotion to captain in the 2nd United States Colored Cavalry Regiment. Battles in which Dollard was a participant included the Siege of Suffolk and Second Battle of Suffolk, and the Siege of Petersburg. In September 1864, Dollard received a head wound during the Battle of Chaffin's Farm, and his heroism and coolness under fire while directing troops to maintain their lines resulted in his promotion to major. After the war ended, Dollard's regiment performed occupation duty in Texas, and he was mustered out at Brazos Island on February 12, 1866. After the war, Dollard as an active member of the Grand Army of the Republic, Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and other veterans groups. He took part in numerous reunions and other public events to commemorate the war, and published several newspaper articles and other writings about his experiences. Post-Civil War After the war, Dollard decided to move to Chicago and go into business with a friend and former officer who had served with him during the war. They moved from Chicago to Galesburg, but soon had a falling out. Dollard traveled to San Antonio, Texas and New Orleans, Louisiana in search of other opportunities, but returned to Galesburg several months later to begin studying law with a local attorney. He was admitted to the bar in 1870 and practiced throughout Knox, Peoria, and Fulton Counties. In 1876 he was the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for State's Attorney of Knox County. Move to Dakota Territory In 1878, Dollard traded parcels with another landowner and acquired one in the Dakota Territory, which he visited in 1878. Deciding to relocate to Dakota in 1879, Dollard filed for five claims under the Homestead Acts in what is now Douglas County, South Dakota, where he began to farm. According to the records of the U.S. Land Office, Dollard was the first permanent settler in the county. While farming most of the year, Dollard resided in Scotland, South Dakota during the winter and practiced law, including travel to the territorial capital of Yankton for trials. Continued career In 1881, Dollard gave up farming and settled in Scotland, where he developed a law practice that covered Bon Homme, Hutchinson, and several adjoining counties. By now a Republican, Dollard was elected to several local offices and participated in the statehood conventions of 1883 and 1885. In 1884, he was elected State's Attorney of Bon Homme County and he was chosen to serve as attorney general of South Dakota's interim state government in 1885. In 1888, Dollard was elected to the Territorial Council, the upper house of the legislature, and he served until South Dakota attained statehood in November 1889. In 1889, he was elected as the first state attorney general and he was reelected in 1890. In 1892, Dollard was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for governor. Later that year he was elected to a term in South Dakota Senate and in 1896 he won a term in the South Dakota House of Representatives. In 1898, Dollard was an unsuccessful candidate for Congress at the state Republican convention; the nominations were won by Charles H. Burke and Robert J. Gamble, who went on to win the general election. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Dollard undertook recruiting efforts in South Dakota, and succeeded in raising 1,200 volunteers for the army. Later life In 1905, Dollard left South Dakota and settled in Santa Monica, California, where he lived in retirement. His wife and he traveled extensively throughout the western United States as tourists. In 1909, he entered the race for mayor of Santa Monica, but he withdrew his candidacy before election day. Death He died in Santa Monica on April 28, 1912. He was buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Scotland, South Dakota. Family In 1875, Dollard married Carrie E. Dunn of Yates City, Illinois. She was a school teacher and librarian, activist for women's suffrage, and participant in other civic causes; in addition to serving as the first teacher in Scotland's public school, she organized and managed the town's library for many years. They were the parents of a son, Archie, who they adopted when he was an infant, and who died at the age of nine. A daughter, Maud, was born and died in 1889.

The monastery is considered one of the three main Marian foundations built in the city along with the Blachernai and the Chalkoprateia. The monastery was situated beyond the Chalkoprateia by the sea and served as the counterpart of the Blachernai so that these structures bracket the city of Constantinople as well as the processions such as the weekly Blachernai procession that began at the Theodosian walls and ended at Chalkoprateia. The Hodegon Monastery is believed to be named after the term hodegoi, which referred to the guides who led the blinds toward the miraculous well within the structure. Tradition states that the monastery held the Icon of the Hodegetria, believed to have been painted by Saint Luke. According to an account by Xanthopoulos, this relic was brought from Antioch. While it was at Hodegon, Ruy Gonzales de Clavijo described it sometime in 1403 to 1406 as a painting with a square panel that was covered with precious stones such as emeralds, sapphires, topaz, and pearls. When the icon was sent to Pulcheria, she took a vow of chastity.Warren Treadgold, A History of the Byzantine State and Society, Stanford 1997, .

It was released for Windows in 2001 by Infogrames. As well as the classic underground world, it has an outside world, much like Dig Dug II. The original concepts from the original are still there, but new ideas have been added.  Gameplay  The main character, Dig Dug (who also goes by the name of Taizo Hori in other games), is equipped with his usual weapon, the pump. Gameplay progresses as Taizo Hori moves from planet to planet, each with a different number of levels, which each have underground levels. On the planet's surface, the gameplay is 3D, and there are a variety of holes. At first, there are no enemies on the surface, but Taizo Hori can still fire his pump in eight directions, the usual, plus diagonally. These holes are closed, but when first reaching a level, a Pooka will jump out, opening a mound. If Taizo Hori is maneuvered into it, the gameplay will shift to underground mode. This mode is basically the same as the original game, but with a few more features described later. The enemies can \\"ghost\\" through walls at certain times too. After all but one of the enemies are destroyed, the remaining one will begin to flee at double-speed to the top of the level, which now has a tunnel to the surface. If the player destroys it, the level ends, and Taizo Hori appears back on the surface. If it escapes, the same occurs, but now the enemy is on the surface. It still must be killed, but is harder, because its movement is no longer limited to just four directions. Gameplay goes on like this for the rest of the game.

Found in western North America, it was originally described in 1965 as a species of Lentinus by American mycologist Orson K. Miller. Taxonomy The fungus was first described as Lentinellus montanus by Orson K. Miller, based on collections that he had made in Idaho. In 1985 it was transferred to Neolentinus, a segregate genus created for Lentinus-type fungi that cause a brown rot in wood. The specific epithet ponderosa derives from the Latin word for \\"heavy\\". Description Closeup of the serrated gill edge The fruit bodies have convex to flattened caps ranging from in diameter. The caps have small cinnamon-brown scales (squamules) on the surface and a margin that is usually curved inward initially. The narrow gills have an adnate attachment to the stipe and are closely spaced, with intervening lamellulae (short gills) that extend about two-thirds of the distance to the stipe. The gill edges are serrated (notched like a saw), a feature that inspired the mushroom's common name. Gills are initially whitish before aging to light buff to light orange. The stipe measures long by thick. Its reddish-brown surface is made of small scales that are less dense in the upper half, where it has a more whitish or buff color. Fruit bodies produce a dull white to buff spore print. Microscopically, the spores are somewhat spindle-shaped when viewed from the side, and elliptical viewed from the front; they measure 8‚Äì10.5 by 3.5‚Äì4.4 Œºm and are inamyloid. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are thin-walled and club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 26‚Äì36 by 5‚Äì8.8 Œºm. The cystidia on both the faces and edges of the gills are thin-walled, hyaline (translucent), narrowly club-shaped, and measure 26‚Äì36 by 5‚Äì8.8 Œºm. The cap cuticle comprises threadlike hyphae with a diameter of 4.4‚Äì8 Œºm, while the cap flesh is made of interwoven hyphae (both thick- and thin-walled) measuring 2.5‚Äì6 Œºm. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae. The young mushrooms are edible, although they tend to become tough when mature. The flesh has a fruit or indistinct odor and a mild taste. They are prized by the Rar√°muri Indians of Mexico. Habitat and distribution Neolentinus ponderosus is a saprophytic species, and grows on the stumps and logs of conifers, particularly ponderosa pine. It causes a brown rot in wood, whereby it breaks down the hemicellulose and cellulose to cause a brown discoloration, and the subsequent cracking of the wood into roughly cubical pieces. Fruit bodies grow singly or in small clusters, and usually prefer open spots with direct sunlight. The range of the fungus is restricted to the Pacific Northwest region of western North America.

He was the pupil of his father, the Venetian painter and later alchemist Valerio Corte. He trained under Luca Cambiaso. According to Baldinucci, he was often in demand as a portrait painter. As a young man, he traveled to London and Paris. It is said that Queen Elizabeth of England requested a portrait from him,R. Soprani, p.102. although he is not mentioned in Lord Orfurd's Anecdotes. In Genoa, he painted Saints Simon and Francis for Santa Maria del Carmine. He painted San Pietro di Banchi adoring the Virgin (1600) for the church of the same name. For the church of San Pietro he painted the titular Saint at the feet of the Virgin; for San Francesco, the altar-piece of the chapel of Prince Massa, representing Mary Magdalene; and for the church of Santa Maria del Carmine two pictures of St. Simeon and St. Francis. He was known for painting portraits. On December 30, 1612, he was imprisoned by the Roman Inquisition for espousing Lutheran beliefs and possessing Protestant literature. He confessed and underwent a public abjuration of his heretical beliefs on August 11, 1613 in the church of San Domenico. He was condemned to life in prison, although he died within weeks.R. Soprani, p 104. Cesare's son, Davidde, was trained as a painter by Domenico Fiasella. Davidde died in 1657 during the plague. Other pupils were Bernardo Strozzi and Luciano Borzone.

Like his first novel, La Tumba, De Perfil was a best-seller, and furthered Agustin's reputation as a writer. Set in Mexico City, specifically in an urban middle- class neighborhood in the 1960s, the novel covers in detail three days in the life of the main character, an unnamed young man who is going to enter high school. The novel is longer and more complex, yet more polished and natural than La Tumba. It does not have a particular theme or purpose, following the main character most of the time, in the present, first person. X is rebellious but his naivety and inexperience embarrasses him from time to time. To protect himself he would assume an experienced or indifferent air, but he is aware of his hypocrisy. By the novel's end, the reader has felt what is like to be X, and reads a kind of wild dream of his future as boyfriend of Queta and student leader, and of his past as a tiny baby in his mother's arms. Plot summary The novel opens with the phrase \\"Behind the rock is the world I live in\\" and the reader finds him smoking cigarettes in his home's garden, hiding from his parents behind a big rock. (In Mexico it is common but not compulsory to live with one's parents until marriage, even if one has the means to support oneself). The son of a psychiatrist and a housewife, he has a younger brother he can not stand because he is acting like his psychiatrist father all the time. Also, he assume that his parents could divorce and have doubts about his birth (X jokes that he is adopted). His friend Ricardo is timid and naive, having bold ideas he never dares put to practice, and when he does, he usually makes a joke of himself. Ricardo is very attached to X, the closest thing to a name the main character gets in the novel (given by Ricardo in one of his \\"confidential\\" plans in his diary), but X thinks Ricardo is too childish. No one can think that Ricardo has a crush on X, but he has an absence in the father figure pattern, substituting X even if he tortures him all the time. X meets many kinds of people: a fledgling music group about to make their first record (Los su√°sticos) and their homosexual manager, a young and rich female singer (Queta) with which he have an affair, his flamboyant and cynical neighbor Octavio, who does not have any aspirations but only to be a rock star even though he does not belong to a band, his intellectual cousin (Esteban) who fights X' for his conventional lifestyle and more characters, most with some artistic or intellectual aspiration, including student leaders, highly politicized (a future vision of events that will happen in the next five years in Mexico). Major themes The narrative is fluid and changing, most of the time X's thoughts in the first person, written in different styles. There are also memories, the point of view of a different character, a few flashbacks from his family past, and finally a technique very common in Jose Agustin's work: mixing the character's speech with the narrative, without making any distinction, typographical or punctuation, leaving it to the reader to discern which character is speaking. Other times spacing and font size delineate speech.

It can be described as the, \\"back half of a bicycle.\\" The rider of a trailer bike usually has a saddle, handlebars, and pedals. Some fold for more compact storage. History The trailer bike was patented by Canadian entrepreneur Delbert Adams. Adams started the manufacturer of trailer bikes, Trail-a-Bike, and began selling them in the early 1990s, although the same concept had been previously independently and imitatively invented by others at least as far back as the 1930s with the Rann Trailer. Configurations Trailer bikes have come in a variety of configurations. These include upright-bicycle-like seating, and recumbent-bicycle-like seating as with the Weehoo iGo. Trailer bikes have been available in single-seat and tandem configurations. Trailer bikes may have just one gear or more than one. They seldom have brakes. Attachments A trailer bike is attached to a bicycle at either the seatpost or on a special rear rack by a linkage that allows for pivoting. Alternatively, the hitch mechanism may rotate using the seatpost as the pivot. The attachment may include a quick-release option.

Muftian is located close to the passing Grand Trunk Road, and around the historic Rohtas Road, which is the long used route to the famous Rohtas Fort. Muftian is a farming village and it borders Dina and is historically well known for the shrine of Kwaja Maqbool. It has been visited over many years by people from Punjab and also Kashmir.  History  Little is documented about the origins of this village. It is believed to have been named after a famous Islamic jurist and scholar Jalal-ud-din known as \\"Mufti sahib\\" who (as traditions cite) was relied upon for a technical religious verdict in the time of the latter Mughal emperors. A prominent shrine to \\"Mufti sahib\\" has been built within the \\"old graveyard\\" bordering Muftian and Dina, running parallel with Rohtas Road. \\"Mufti sahib\\" was also known as \\"Baba Mufti\\". Kwaja Maqbool whose shrine is now the central point for visitors in Muftian, was a student of the jurist and Islamic scholar \\"Mufti sahib\\". Around the end of the 19th century saw the development of Muftian with notable contributions from Mian Muhammad Mahram Haidari Chishti and Mian Muhammad Baqa Haidari Chishti in the organisation and setup of a dedicated teaching for the memorisation of the Qur'an. It was through the instructions of the famous Chishti Spiritual Leader Khwaja Shams-ud-Din Sialvi that this requirement of Muftian Village was recognised, and both Mian Muhammad Mahram Haidari Chishti and Mian Muhammad Baqa Haidari Chishti were appointed to commence this work under the patronage of their Spiritual Leader Pir Syed Ghulam Haidar Ali Shah of Jalalpur Sharif. Following this many individuals and families from Muftian and surrounding areas, pledged spiritual allegiance to Pir Syed Ghulam Haidar Ali Shah of Jalalpur Sharif and subsequently to there descendants. Notable efforts were made by the locals of these areas in assisting the Amir-e- Hizbullah Pir Syed Muhammad Fazal Shah in supporting the cause for an independent Islamic Republic (Pakistan), for which strenuous efforts were made from 1927, which is the year Hizbullah (\\"Party of God\\") was formed by Pir Syed Muhammad Fazal Shah.Religious Leadership and the Pakistan Movement in the Punjab, David Gilmartin, Modern Asian Studies, Vol. 13, No. 3 (1979), pp. 485-517 These efforts continued through to the creation of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in August 1947.Report of Mufti Murid Ahmad, Divisional Organizer, to headquarters, 3 February 1946.

He serves as executive chair of the board for the Center for Investigative Reporting in Berkeley, California. He is best known for his work as a war correspondent and investigative journalist. In 1986, he was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on the fall of Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Later, he held leadership positions with The San Francisco Examiner, San Francisco Chronicle, and Hearst Newspapers Corporation. Early life Bronstein was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on October 4, 1950. He is the father of Roan Joseph Bronstein. As a child, Bronstein's family moved frequently. Much of his youth was spent in Montreal, Canada. Eventually, he settled in California. Bronstein attended but did not graduate from the University of California, Davis. While at Davis, he got his first taste of journalism. He wrote movie reviews for the school paper. Career Bronstein's first professional job was as a reporter for KQED-TV in San Francisco. In 1980, The San Francisco Examiner hired him as a beat reporter. He went on to report from conflict areas around the world as a foreign correspondent for eight years, such as Peru, the Middle East, El Salvador and the Philippines. In 1991, Bronstein was promoted to the executive editor position at the Examiner. He held that position until 2000. When an alligator escaped into a city lake in 1996, Bronstein arrived in scuba gear to assist with the capture, but police turned him away. Phil Bronstein was senior vice president and executive editor of the Chronicle before serving as executive chair of the board for the Center for Investigative Reporting in Berkeley, California Hearst Corporation, the parent company of the Examiner, bought the San Francisco Chronicle in 2000. The Chronicle was the other major daily paper for the San Francisco Bay Area. Hearst already owned the Examiner and chose to merge the two newsrooms. Bronstein became senior vice president and executive editor of the Chronicle in November 2000. Bronstein was editor after the merger, which occurred at the same time as a general decline in the newspaper industry, making the job even more difficult. Bronstein made staffing changes, created new features, and attempted to bring the Chronicle into the Internet age, all while preserving the Bay Area cultural viewpoint. In the first two years of the merger, staff was reduced from 520 to 485 and there was less content within the daily paper. In January 2008, Hearst Corporation announced Bronstein as editor-at-large for both the Chronicle and Hearst Newspapers. In his new role, Bronstein wrote a weekly column for the Chronicle. He also wrote blog entries for SFGate.com. At the Chronicle, he was replaced as editor by Arizona Republic editor Ward Bushee. Bronstein left Hearst Newspapers and the Chronicle in March 2012. He had been named chairman of the board for the Center for Investigative Reporting in 2011. Upon leaving the Chronicle, his role at the Center expanded. Personal life The tabloid press has closely followed Bronstein's personal life. He has been married four times. He married actress Sharon Stone on February 14, 1998. They were unable to conceive biological children as Stone suffered from an autoimmune disease, resulting in three miscarriages. They adopted a baby son, Roan Joseph Bronstein later on in 2000.The couple separated in 2003. They completed their divorce on January 29, 2004. At first, Stone and Bronstein shared joint custody of their adopted son, Roan. In 2008, a judge gave Bronstein full custody of their son. In 2001, Bronstein was attacked by a Komodo dragon at the Los Angeles Zoo. He was on a private tour, and a keeper had invited him into the enclosure. Bronstein was bitten on his bare foot, as the keeper had told him to take off his white shoes and socks, which the keeper stated could excite the Komodo dragon as they were the same color as the white rats the zoo fed the dragon. Although he escaped, Bronstein needed to have several tendons in his foot reattached surgically. In 2006, Bronstein married Christine Borders, the daughter of Borders Book Store co- founder Louis Borders. She is the founder of \\"A Band of Wives,\\" a social network for women. The couple have two children. One is named Caleb Luis bronstein. Awards and recognition In 1986, Bronstein was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on the overthrow of Ferdinand Marcos, long-standing dictator of the Philippines. Bronstein's work in the Philippines also earned him awards from the Associated Press, the Overseas Press Club, the World Affairs Council, and the Media Alliance.

In most vehicles, at least one car outlet is present. Some vehicles, especially vans, tend to have more power outlets, usually one for the front passengers, one for the rear passengers and one for the luggage trunk. The voltage of the power outlet is usually near 12 V DC, (14V to 15V while the running engine is turning the alternator, in order to charge the car battery while providing electrical power), because it is directly powered without regulation from the car's electrical system.  Accessories  Examples of devices that can be operated from an automobile power outlet include lights, fans, and small motorized tools such as air compressors for inflating tires. Many portable electronic devices use an adapter connected to the car power outlet to recharge their internal batteries or to directly operate from the vehicle electrical system. Devices that require alternating-current mains electricity can be operated with a plug-in inverter, which produce output voltage usable by many alternating current devices. Automobiles may provide several 12V receptacles that are intended only to operate electrical accessories and which cannot be used with a cigarette lighter despite having the same shape and diameter. Car manufacturers may offer a cigarette lighter only as an optional extra-cost accessory. Usually, only one 12V receptacle near the driver is intended for a cigarette lighter, with other receptacles designated as \\"12 V auxiliary power outlets\\" not rated for use with a lighter. Some vehicles provide 24 volts to the outlet, so some accessories carry a 24 volt rating.  History  The electrical cigar-lighter was invented and patented in the early 1880s by the German inventor . In the 1890s, these tools were sold as electrical cigar lighters (Cigarrenanz√ºnder), and later as Zigarrenanz√ºnder in the major German warehouse catalogues. Probably in the 1920s they were renamed \\"cigarette lighters\\", as cigarettes overtook cigars in sales. In 1921, the Morris was issued for a so-called \\"wireless\\" or \\"cordless\\" lighter with a removable element. The igniter was heated in the socket and then manually removed for use after an appropriate time interval. In the United States, cigarette lighters started appearing as standard equipment in automobiles in 1925‚Äì1926. In 1928, the Connecticut Automotive Specialty Company (Casco) in Bridgeport patented its version of an automotive cigarette lighter, which used a cord and reel. In the reel-type lighters, the igniter unit was connected with a source of current by a cable which was wound on a spring drum so that the igniter unit and cable could be withdrawn from the socket and be used for lighting a cigar or cigarette. As the removable plug was returned to the socket, the wires were reeled back into it. The circuit was closed either by pressing a button or removing the igniter from its socket. The modern \\"automatic\\" removable automotive V-Coil lighter was developed by Casco in 1956, for which it received , issued in 1960.  Use as a lighter  Car cigarette lighter, with brass-colored heating element visible at front The lighter is a metal or plastic cylinder containing a thin flat coil of nichrome metal strip, through which high current (‚âà10 amperes) passes when the device is activated, usually by pushing it into the socket as though it were a push-button. When pushed in, the lighter is held against the force of a spring by a clip attached to a bi- metallic strip. The heating element glows orange hot in seconds, causing the bi-metallic strip to bend and release the mechanism, and the handle pops out, eliminating the need for the user to time the heating operation. If the lighter is then promptly removed from its socket, it can light a cigarette, cigar, or tinder. A common feature of Italian cars in the 1960s to the 1970s such as Alfa Romeos and Ferraris is the Brico Pram cigarette lighter, which differs from conventional designs in that the lighter does not pop out for removal to light a cigarette, even though it visually resembles the conventional design, instead the centre of the lighter features a tapered opening for the user to insert a cigarette until it touches the heating element, the rim of the handle is then pressed down to activate the lighter, the heating element then lights the cigarette and disengages the circuit with an audible ping once the desired temperature is reached as per a conventional lighter. The advantage of such a design is in safety as the red-hot heating element cannot be accidentally dropped onto an occupant's lap, but it takes away the ability for the lighter to be removed for the receptacle to be used as a power outlet, it also does not allow cigars to be lit as the opening is not large enough.  Use as an electrical outlet  fuse A power strip designed for use with auxiliary power outlets In newer cars, the socket is equipped with a plastic cover without the lighter heating element. However, the socket has been repurposed and continues to be used to power consumer electronics in vehicles. Often, a vehicle may come with several outlets for convenience, some in the rear passenger area of the vehicle or even the cargo area, for powering portable devices. These outlets usually have a plastic cap tethered to them, and are usually labeled as being only for DC power, because they are not intended to withstand the heat produced by an electrical cigarette lighter. The use of cigarette lighter receptacles to supply 12 volt DC power is an example of backward compatibility to a de facto standard. As a power connector, the lighter receptacle is larger, harder to use and less reliable than other DC connectors. Cigarette lighter receptacles are in widespread use in many highway vehicles and some boats. Portable cigarette lighter receptacles attached to cables and alligator clips for connection directly to car batteries are available for temporary use. In newer vehicles, one or more USB connectors may also be provided. Standardized 12 volt DC automobile plugs are defined in the United States by UL Standard 2089 regarding vehicle battery adapters. This standard covers plugs and cord sets that insert into cigarette lighter receptacles. In Europe, 12 volt plugs and sockets are not specially regulated, and do not require approvals for the CE mark. The male plug is sometimes used to feed power into a vehicle to recharge its battery, because it usually has no regulatory circuitry between the outlet and the car battery. For instance, portable solar battery maintainers generally connect to a vehicle's battery in this manner. Trickle chargers also sometimes connect in this way, eliminating the need to leave a vehicle's hood open, as well as eliminating the possibility of reversed polarity. Most cars nowadays are designed with a battery-negative earthing system and therefore have +12v positive power distribution. In such case the centre pin of a plug/socket will be +12V DC and the outer casing 0V. While polarity is not an issue for a cigarette lighter, it is prudent to verify correct matching of polarities when connecting other kinds of accessory. In some models, the cigarette lighter outlet is not powered when the ignition key is removed and charging is not possible. = Technical details = The sockets and mating plugs are defined in the ANSI/SAE J563 specification. For the 12 volt systems, the center contact is the positive terminal and the shell is the negative terminal. Most automobiles connect the negative terminal to the frame of the vehicle (negative ground). 12 volt auto connectors are made to comply with a standard by Underwriters Laboratories for safety. UL2089 was developed to cover the requirements for portable adapters rated 24 V DC or less that are intended to be supplied from the battery powered electrical system of a vehicle. Products covered by the standard include cord assemblies of a plug that mates with the standard cigarette receptacle found in automobiles. ;6-volt cigarette lighter receptacle and plug * Receptacle inside diameter: (median ) * Plug body diameter: (median ) ; 12-volt cigarette lighter receptacle and plug, size A * Receptacle inside diameter: (median ) * Plug body diameter: (median ) * Most often used in American automobiles ; 12-volt cigarette lighter receptacle and plug, size B * Receptacle inside diameter: (median ) * Plug body diameter: (median ) * Most often used in European automobiles, and sometimes as a second socket in American automobiles expressly for DC power connections. Plugs often include a pilot light LED indicator to indicate that electrical power is connected. Optionally, the plug may be equipped with an internal fuse for electrical safety, usually rated at 10 amps or less. In some designs, the tip of the plug may be unscrewed to reveal a cylindrical glass fuse; other variants may use a blade-type fuse inserted into the side or back of the plug. = Design considerations = Since the cigarette lighter socket was originally designed only to heat a cigarette lighter, repurposing these sockets as generic power connectors can lead to many problems. In addition to the issues with partially-compatible physical dimensions, the plugs can vibrate out of the socket under normal driving conditions, owing to poor retention. Also, there have been reports of melted plug tips due to poor contact and heat generation from ohmic resistance. Non-vehicular use in stationary settings may avoid vibration problems when used as an alternative to 120 volt AC outlets, but low-quality connectors may still develop high resistance or intermittent contact. As a DC power connector, it has the disadvantages of bulkiness, relatively low current rating, and poor contact reliability. However, due to its large diameter, the connector and appliances can have a robust design against damage such as bending. Additionally, the connector is reversible. A second problem is that nominally \\"twelve-volt\\" power in cars fluctuates widely. The outlet is connected directly to the electrical system of the car. The actual voltage, matching the car battery's voltage, will be approximately 12.5 volts when dormant (less in cold conditions), approximately 14.5 volts when the engine and the alternator/generator are operating (more when cold), and may briefly drop as low as 5‚Äì6 volts during engine start due to the high temporary battery current usage. When used, DC to DC converters will usually compensate for small fluctuations, but reliable power may not be available without an independent battery-powered uninterruptible power supply. However, almost all car accessories are able to adapt to these variations of voltage, and keep working without issues. Rarely, more extreme cases of voltage fluctuation can occur when the car battery is disconnected while the engine is running, or when the car receives a jump start. When the battery is disconnected while the engine is running, its voltage smoothing effect (similar to capacitors) is unavailable and a load dump transient can produce very high voltages as the built in voltage regulator has been controlling the alternator field current to charge the vehicle battery and although it will attempt to reduce the field current to keep the output voltage constant, the field winding is highly inductive and setting the current to its new value takes several hundred milliseconds, during which the alternator output voltage will exceed its intended value. The load dump transient may also ruin the diodes in the alternator by exceeding their breakdown voltage. A car receiving a jump start from a truck may be subject to a 24 V electrical system used in some vehicles. Also, a \\"double battery jump-start\\" is performed by some tow truck drivers in cold climates.

Early life  The year of Lillie's birth remains uncertain but it is believed that she was born in the year 1867 or 1868 in Carnew, in the rural county of Wicklow. She came from a Protestant family. Her father was John Reynolds, a farm labourer, and her mother's name was Margaret. Lillie was the fourth child in the family and she had an older sister named Maggie who was born in 1861, and identical twin brothers, Johnny and George who were born in 1863. Education and career Lillie Reynolds was a member of the Girls Friendly Society in the Church of Ireland. This society, organised by the church itself, was set up to help girls particularly from rural Ireland to find some sort of employment. This organisation found Lilly work as a domestic servant with William and Anne Wilson in Dublin. Mr Wilson was a stockbroker and notary public. He and his family lived at 35 Merrion Square East, Dublin. During the time that Lillie worked for this family, she rose from her position as a maid to that of a governess to the couple's younger children. It was around this time that Lille met and became romantically involved with James Connolly who at that time was in the British Army stationed in Ireland.  Family life  James resigned from the army and with Lillie moved to Scotland around 1890. They were married in St John the Baptist Church, Perth on 30 April 1890. In the spring of 1890 they moved to Edinburgh and lived at 22 West Port in the Grassmarket area. James scraped a living as a labourer and then as a manure carter with Edinburgh Corporation. They had seven children (six daughters and one son), but only six of them reached adulthood. The couple's eldest daughter Mona was born 11 April 1891, their second daughter Nora was born 14 November 1892, their third daughter Aideen was born 3 March 1895, their fourth daughter Mollie was born in November 1896, their fifth daughter Moria Elizabeth was born 1 January 1899. and their sixth daughter Fiona was born 22 August 1907. The couple's only son Roderick James, known as Roddy, was born 11 February 1901. Mona died 4 August 1904 after an accident where her apron caught fire when she was baby-sitting one of her sisters. Lillie and James never recovered from this tragedy. Connolly returned to Dublin in May 1896 as paid organiser of the Dublin Socialist Society. He founded the Irish Socialist Republican Party in May 1896, and in 1898 The Workers' Republic newspaper, the first Irish Socialist paper, from their house at number 54 Pimlico, where Lillie and James Connolly and their three daughters shared the house with six other families, a total of 30 people. In 1903, James thought that he and his family would be better off living in America due to the little progress the Irish Socialist Party was making. Also after the tragedy that happened to their first born child, Lillie again trusted her husband and thought it would be a great way to start life again. The Connolly family emigrated to the United States in 1904, passing through Ellis Island like many other Irish Immigrants. There is record of the family living in the Bronx, New York in the 1910 United States Federal Census. Lillie and her husband James lived on East 155th street with their 6 surviving children. In 1910, the Connolly family moved back to Ireland when James was offered a job as organiser in James Larkin's Irish Transport and General Workers' Union. For a period, James lived at Constance Markievicz's home in Dublin while Lillie lived in Belfast with their children. James would travel up the north every weekend. As reported in the Census of Ireland in 1911 they were living in 70 Lotts Road, South (Pembroke West, Dublin) with their 6 children. James became more active in revolutionary politics and played a central role in the 1916 Easter Rising. Following the surrender of the rebels, James was sentenced to death and executed on May 12 1916. Three months later Lillie received ¬£50 from the Irish Volunteer Dependents Fund. Lillie made the most out of this in order to get her children to live a normal life.  Later life  After James' execution Lillie kept out of the limelight and spent her time occupied with family and domestic affairs. Their daughter Nora became interested in politics as an adult and she and her husband Seamus worked with the Labour Party. Their son Roddy also become interested in politics while their other siblings remained outside politics. Towards the end of 1937, she attended a children's dancing festival which was her last public event. On December 23, the Irish Press reported that she had fallen ill and doctors were attending her at her home in Rathmines. She died four weeks later on 22 January 1938 at the age of seventy-one. She had a state funeral in Dublin on 29 January 1938. The Irish Times reporting on her funeral wrote: \\"Throughout her life the late Mrs Connolly appeared but rarely in public. She was of the most retiring and modest disposition, home-loving and devoted to the welfare of her family\\". Lillie Connolly was born a Protestant but after James's execution she became a Catholic on 15 August 1916. James had been a Roman Catholic and before his death he had asked Lillie to become a Catholic.

Both these are in contrast to troglobites, which strictly live in underground habitats. Examples of trogloxene/subtroglophile species are bats, rats, raccoons and some opiliones (this last group also has fully troglobitic species). Several extinct trogloxenes are known like cave bears, cave lions, cave leopards, and cave hyenas. Indications trusted by geologists and archaeologists combine to show that these animals lived there in the latter part, at least, of the third interglacial epoch, and on through the fourth and last glacial advance, when, although central Europe was free from an ice cap, an almost Arctic climate prevailed, with much rain. This is what is known as the Upper Paleolithic when humanity in Europe was represented by the Neanderthals. During the Upper Paleolithic, many carnivores gradually adapted by increased fur and resorting far more than previously to the shelter of caves. The cave bear (Ursus spelaeus) was the most habitual in its use of caves, and occupied caves before humans began to do so.

Directed by Frank Capra, it starred Claudette Colbert (in her film debut) and Ben Lyon. It is now considered to be a lost film.SilentEra entry Plot A baby boy is found abandoned in a Hell's Kitchen tenement and subsequently is raised by three men: a German delicatessen owner (Sterling), a Jewish tailor (Sidney), and an Irish street cleaner (Cameron). They adopt the boy and raise him as their own. The timeline jumps 20 years into their future. The now-grown Mike (Lyon) resists going to college because he does not wish to be a financial burden to his adoptive fathers, however a pretty Italian girl, Mary (Colbert) working at the delicatessen convinces him to go. Mike enrolls at Yale and gains a reputation as a sports hero. He disavows his three fathers, which leads to the Irishman giving him a thrashing in front of the boy's best friends. He begins to associate with gamblers and ends up owing them money. To settle his debts, they demand he purposely lose the school's big rowing match with Harvard. His three fathers and the girl come to support him during the race, and he defies the gamblers and wins the race. His three fathers then come forward to confront and deal with the gamblers. Cast *Ben Lyon as Mike *Claudette Colbert as Mary *George Sidney as Abraham Katz *Ford Sterling as Herman Schultz *Hugh Cameron as Patrick O'Malley *Richard \\"Skeets\\" Gallagher as Coxey Pendleton *Rudolph Cameron as Henry Sharp *Mabel Swor as Evelyn Joyce Background For the Love of Mike is based on the story Hell's Kitchen by John Moroso. Frank Capra himself referred to the film as his first flop. Having recently ended his association as writer for actor Harry Langdon, this became Capra's first opportunity to direct a New York based production. Producer Robert Kane had contracts to provide First National Pictures with 10 films, and had planned each to be financed with profits from the preceding. For the Love of Mike was the tenth in this package, funding was limited, and agent Leland Hayward convinced Capra into deferring his salary until the end of production. Capra was never paid for his participation. The film was considered a commercial failure despite a strong cast and decent production values. Preservation status The film is marked as being the screen debut of Claudette Colbert and her only silent film appearance. After the film received poor reviews and failed financially, Colbert vowed, \\"I shall never make another film\\". However, two years later, she signed with Paramount Pictures. Reception Critic Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times wrote that the film \\"makes no pretensions of being anything but a movie. It seemed to satisfy the audience at the Hippodrome yesterday afternoon, for there was laughter and, at the end, applause\\", and concluded \\"Claudette Colbert, who was seen in Kenyon Nicholson's play \\"The Barker,\\" lends her charm to this obstreperous piece of work. She seems quite at home before the camera\\".

The Sentinel Rock Waterfalls is 200 metres (656 feet) and offers a cliff face that is used for rock climbing. The water from Soochipara Falls later joins Chulika River or popularly known as Chaliyar River after Velarimala Hills near Cherambadi (Tamil Nadu) in Kerala. Once people reach the parking area, they have to pass through a security check at the entrance where they make sure you don't carry any plastic. It takes 10-15 minutes walk to the waterfalls and water flow is less during summer, which makes it easy to reach the rocks where water falls.

Description The body is symmetrical, with a branchial crown made up of two lobes, one holding a stalked operculum. The operculum is winged with spines. The operculum seals the tube when the animal retreats into its tube. The tentacles of the branchial crown are used as gills and as a way of capturing food. Galeolaria build and live within white to grey calcareous tubes, up to 3 cm in length. These tubes may be found singly or in complex interwoven colonies, forming a distinctive zone at the mid tidal regions. They may be so thick and dense that they form a microhabitat for many other creatures. When expose to air at low tide, these animals retreat within their tubes. Habitat A distinctive zone-forming species with its upper limit at the lowest neap water high-water mark. Isolated tubes may be found at any level, even above the highest tide, only being wetted by spray.

Stravaganza on the Fox Kids programming block. It aired from November 20, 1993 to July 28, 1997. The series was originally intended as a spin off from Eek! The Cat. The segment was supposed to air at the start of Eek's second season in September 1993, but due to production delays, it began in November. Like Eek!, the segment was also a co- production of Nelvana and Fox Kids in association with Savage Studios Ltd. Dee Snider, from the band Twisted Sister composed the show's theme song. Plot The series chronicled the misadventures of a trio of dinosaur mercenaries released from incarceration (for being falsely accused of helping an enemy Thuggosaur in a time of war) and charged with the task of eliminating two primitive human beings after scientists realize that if humanity is allowed to multiply it will mean the end of dinosaur supremacy. However, despite their superior size and firepower and the obliviousness of their targets, the mercenaries always fail to kill the humans with comic results. Their usual preferred method of attacking the humans was throwing bombs full of bees, which upon impact would usually then go after the dinosaurs; forcing them to run to water to get away from the bees. Although the mercenaries failed to eliminate the humans, they had better luck in defending Jurassic City from enemies, and had been successful in dangerous missions such as rescuing the kidnapped daughter of the president, which might explain why the team was allowed to continue working and not returned to prison. Characters=Doc Tari= Doc Tari (human codename Doc), is the leader of the team. He is a Parasaurolophus only with a hole in the center of his crest that contains many gadgets. Some examples include a buzz-saw and a grappling hook. He is the team's most focused member, but is every bit as unfocused as Kutter and Squatt when not chasing the humans or performing missions. Doc, both in voice and mannerisms is a parody of various Arnold Schwarzenegger film characters such as John Matrix from Commando, Dutch from Predator, and with a bit of the Terminator. His catch phrase is \\"We move!\\", voiced by Savage Steve Holland, the co-creator. =Day Z. Kutter= Day Z. Kutter (human codename Kutter) is the second-in-command of the team. He is a Styracosaurus, although he was mis- addressed as a Triceratops. As his name suggests, he is good with knives, being the master of the knife fight, and wears a skull T-shirt. Kutter is smarter than Squatt, but dumber than Doc. On multiple occasions, he is shown to be fooling around with Squatt, requiring Doc's quick wit and strength to help them focus. He is voiced by Bill Kopp, also the co-creator. =Bo Diddley Squatt= Bo Diddley Squatt (human code-name Squatt) is the third member of the team and their top sniper. He is an Allosaurus. He is the clich√© \\"dim- witted clumsy screw-up\\". His voice and mannerisms appear to be similar to Private Hudson, Bill Paxton's character from the film Aliens. Squatt is often used as the volunteer to assess dangerous situations. His catchphrase is \\"Blast 'em all and let the archeologists sort 'em out!\\" and \\"Something tells me that's a bad thing,\\" (to which Kutter would respond, \\"Yes Squatt, that would fit nicely in the bad things category!!!\\"). He is voiced by Jason Priestley and later by Corey Feldman in the fifth season of Eek! Stravaganza. =General Galapagos= General Galapagos General Galapagos is the boss of the Thunderlizards. He is a green bad-tempered Tyrannosaurus. He wears a Blue General military uniform with a gold starred blue cap. He oversees the missions of the Terrible Thunderlizards to hunt down the humans. They never have any luck at accomplishing their mission, which often angers him. He was the one who foresaw that, given the trio's overall performance, their race is doomed. He also has a wife and son. He is voiced by Kurtwood Smith. =Dr. Steggy= A Stegosaurus scientist who works for the Jurassic City Military. He is voiced by Charlie Adler. =Mr. T-Rex= Mr. T-Rex is Galapagos's best soldier. He is a Tyrannosaurus who is based on (and voiced by) Mr. T. T-Rex is clearly a parody of Mr. T's characters Clubber Lang from Rocky III & B. A. Baracus from The A-Team, even saying \\"I pity the fool\\" and calling the Thunderlizards \\"fools\\" or \\"suckas.\\" His anger frequently gets him into trouble resulting in the Thunderlizards having to save him. His two recruits are Nate the Dragon, a Velociraptor that uses a Bo staff and is clearly based on Bruce Lee, and El Gordo, a Spanish-like, unusually small Ceratosaurus with the ability to use camouflage by putting any type of plant on him. =Bill & Scooter= Bill and Scooter are the two humans - Homo sapiens, called \\"mankinds\\" - the Thunderlizards have to eliminate so they will never evolve into the humans of today. Bill is tall and thin with red hair and a beard while Scooter is short, fat and bald with a yellow beard. Both Bill and Scooter wear animal skins (blue for Bill and red for Scooter) somewhat like the ones worn by male characters in The Flintstones, but only covering their right shoulders, and walk in animal skin shoes. While both are aware that the Thunderlizards are trying to kill them, they have no idea why or the anti- human prejudice from Dinosaur City. In a few episodes the pair are friends with some dinosaurs, whom they helped save from danger. Bill (voiced by Charles Adler) is Scooter's ill-tempered partner in the invention game. He gets to test drive the newest devices often with ill, chaotic and disastrous consequences. When he is intact from a failed experiment, Bill must watch out for a dangerous species of jungle slug who regularly tries to eat him. When the jungle slug once almost succeeded at eating him, Bill shouted for help, but Scooter brushed it off as Bill putting on a good comedy act (until he found out off-screen that he really was in danger and did save him). Throughout the series, he is known for his catch phrase \\"When does the hurting stop?\\". Bill is continually depressed, sometimes almost to the point of psychosis. He appears to have a deep-seated hatred for Scooter, having even tried to kill Scooter with a rock while muttering his catch phrase. Scooter (voiced by Curtis Armstrong) is a jolly, overly enthusiastic caveman and is blissfully unaware of Bill's attitude toward him. He is also rarely shown to panic over anything unless the Thunder Lizards are involved. He loves to invent such things as a square wheel, baseball (actually \\"beesball,\\" because they use a beehive as the ball), a washing machine that uses fire, and the pogo stick. Predictably, his inventions often have disastrous consequences for which Bill is the victim. Although Scooter's inventions would fail, sometimes, his inventions would save him and Bill from being hurt by the Thunderlizards, such as when he invented Groucho glasses and a smart bomb failed to detonate on account of the joke glasses disguising their faces. Another episode had a UFO land and an advanced race called the \\"Goalings\\" introduce themselves to Scooter and Bill. When they left their three-holed sphere (which contained the key to world peace and harmony) with the humans, Scooter used it for a game to knock over pins and called it \\"Goaling\\" in honor of the aliens. Bill actually commented Scooter finally invented something that is beneficial. While Bill is the main target of choice for the jungle slug, Scooter has been his target at least once in Bill's stead. Babs Babs is the first female human and introduced later in the series. Bill and Scooter were the only known humans and were both male. The dinosaur scientists, however, later took recovered genetic material from Bill and Scooter, spliced it together, then doubled the X-chromosome to create a female. The Thunderlizards' goal was to use Babs to seduce the two men and bring them back to the dinosaurs and their doom, but she simply abandoned her original mission and lives in the jungle. Unlike the comparable Smurfette, Babs is arrogant and manipulative and was repulsed by Scooter. She preferred the company of Bill, and like Scooter thought up inventions that actually would be useful, but was making Bill do all the manual labor and stating she intended to create \\"womankind\\". Bill eventually gets so angered at all the work Babs was making him do that he was relieved to return to Scooter, who despite everything did not act arrogant to Bill and did all his own work on his inventions. Babs would make future appearances when she had other ideas as how to use Bill and Scooter. =The Thuggosaurs= The Thuggosaurs are a race of undead Grim Reaper-like dinosaurs that live in the X-Zone on the outskirts of Jurassic City (a frequent target of the Thuggosaurs) and are recurring antagonists in the program. The Thuggosaurs are a parody of the hooded, mutant survivors living in the Forbidden Zone from the movies \\"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\\" and prequel \\"Battle for the Planet of the Apes\\" and their targeting of Ape City. Thuggo (voiced by Brad Garrett) is the diabolical leader of a group of black-hooded skeleton-like Thuggosaurs. He is a Megalosaurus. His vanity insists he always look good, so Thuggo often spends more time trying to improve his appearance than accomplishing his evil plans - plans that would mean the end of the Living Dinosaurs once carried out. The Thuggosaurs sometimes had some conspiracies that appeared effective against the dinosaurs, such as kidnapping the president's daughter (voiced by Elizabeth Daily). Thuggo then makes a threatening phone call to the president with his demands, only to foolishly realize he dialed the wrong number. Thuggo also likes watching drama TV shows. Biff is Thuggo's wimpy, flower-loving, second-in-command. He is really too dainty to be part of a villainous organization like The Thuggosaurs. The notable appearances that differentiate the army from Biff and Thuggo are that Biff has a long snout with bucky teeth and wears a pair of goggles, while Thuggo has an alternate skull-shape with sharp teeth-like bones and a rounder face. All other Thuggosaurs resemble both of the villains. =Cast= *Savage Steve Holland .... Doc (36 Episodes) & Additional Voices *Bill Kopp ....

Because the Merchant Marine was not considered a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces, the Purple Heart was not available to Merchant Mariners; as such, the Mariner's Medal was established by an Act of Congress on 10 May 1943 to solve this dilemma. Awarded only to members of the United States Merchant Marine, the Mariner's Medal recognizes seamen who were killed or wounded as a direct result of conflict against an opposing armed force; in specific, it was awarded to any seaman who while serving in a ship during a war period is wounded, suffers physical injury, or suffers through dangerous exposure as a result of an act of enemy of the United States. In the event any such seaman dies from the wounds or injuries before the award can be made to him, the medal may be presented to the person named in the War Risk Policy as his beneficiary. 6,635 Mariner's Medals were awarded for service in the Second World War; all further awards of the Mariner's Medal were suspended on 30 June 1956 and has not been awarded in subsequent U.S. theaters of conflict. Although the Merchant Marine Mariner's Medal is considered a federal service decoration, it may be worn on the uniforms of active duty service members.  Design  Designed by Paul Manship, subsequent awards of the medal are represented by 5/16th inch gold stars affixed to both the suspension ribbon and the ribbon bar. The cases supplied with the medal were also used for the Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal and the Merchant Marine Meritorious Service Medal. On original Second World War issues of the Mariner's Medal, a small triangle separates \\"United\\" and \\"States\\"; re-issues have a small dot.

The name supersedes Agaricus rodmani. It is also commonly known as torq, the banded agaric, spring agaric, or pavement mushroom, as it has been recorded pushing up paving slabs. Taxonomy The specific epithet bitorquis is Latin \\"having two collars\\", and refers to the two rings resulting from detachment of the annulus from both the top and bottom of the stipe. Description The cap is dry, smooth, and white (but staining yellowish in age), and measures 4 to 15 cm in diameter, convex to flat; often with dirt on the cap. The gills are free, very narrow, close, light pink color when young, becoming dark reddish-brown as the spores mature. The spore print is chocolate brown. The stipe is 3 ‚Äì 11 cm long, 2 ‚Äì 4 cm thick, cylindrical to clavate (club-shaped), equal to enlarged at the base, stout, white, smooth, with a membranous veil and thick white mycelial sheathing near the base. The flesh is solid and firm, with a mild odor. It is often confused with Agaricus bernardii; however, that mushroom has a salty odor. =Microscopic details= Agaricus bitorquis mushroom emerging through asphalt concrete in summer. Basidiospores are elliptical in shape, smooth, and with dimensions of 5‚Äì7 x 4‚Äì5.5 ¬µm. Basidia are 20‚Äì25 x 6.5‚Äì8.5 ¬µm, usually four-spored, but often with two-spored basidia present. Cystidia are present and numerous. Distribution and habitat Agaricus bitorquis may be found growing solitary or in small groups in gardens (noted as growing in a gregarious manner), and at roadsides, usually on the pavement, often where salt is applied to combat ice in winter. Pushing through asphalt and slabs, it is subterranean, and often matures underground. It is occasional throughout North America, Europe, and Australia. Edibility Agaricus bitorquis is a choice edible species, with a typical 'mushroomy' taste. Specimens collected in the wild may be gritty due to its often subterranean habitat. As with all specimens picked from the wild, care should be taken to consider the suitability of the collection site, as this species can bioaccumulate toxic heavy metals, especially lead, from polluted areas.Cocchia, L., Vescovia, L., Petrinid, L.E, Petrini, O. (2006). Heavy metals in edible mushrooms in Italy. Food Chem. 98(2):277-84.

It was situated off Creekmoor Lane, to the north of Poole, between Broadstone and Fleetsbridge, Dorset, and was operated by a group of local enthusiasts from October 1968, to April 1973. Origins With the closure and demolition of the Upton (formerly Lytchett Brick Co. Ltd) Brickworks to make way for a residential development their narrow gauge network, which had been in use since 1901, was scrapped allowing rails and sleepers, two 4-wheel drive locomotives (one workable), 8 vee skips, 12 tall brick carrying trollies/wagons and accessories to be acquired for the Creekmoor project, with other railway equipment from the brickworks being purchased by the Launceston Steam Railway. In late October 1968 construction commenced with the line running for just over half a mile from land adjacent to the former Creekmoor Halt Station across smallholdings held by Trevor Waterman - the project's initiator - and his brother. They planned to utilise the railway to carry feed for their pigs. The construction of the railway was a makeshift affair with sheds being constructed from scrap material and rolling stock adapted from available stock. A flat bogie rail carrier, a bogie coach to carry 12 passengers, and a tool van were all built using the chassis and framework. This was flame cut from the brick carrying trollies, cutting down the pillars. Typically, a chassis had to be cut in half, a section of angle iron then welded on each end resulting in two bogies, each needing two axle boxes / wheels. During 1970 ten shillings were offered, and accepted by the British Rail Property division, for the Creekmoor Light Railway to remove all the redundant signal lattice posts, arms, signs and dummy signals from the line approaching Broadstone. Locomotives The 0-6-0WT steam locomotive (works number 9239 of 1939), Fojo, built by Orenstein & Koppel was purchased with proceeds from the sale of scrap metal from the signaling acquisition. It was moved to Hertfordshire and subsequently sold to Welsh Highland Railway, Beddgelert in 1978. The diesel locos bought from Upton Brickworks were - *No.1.

It then went to the Abbey Light Railway, Leeds, it was totally rebuilt in a different guise in 1999 and continues working to this day. Operation The line was operated for five years, usually late afternoon until after dusk. Fridays, Saturdays and access often extended on Sundays with occasional visits from members of the local Railway Club. Turning the coach into the engine shed road was a curiosity. The main track ran down over a ditch to a short stub of only eight feet, the passenger coach being fourteen, firstly had its bogie run onto the stub, Right hand point crossed over, coach pushed over, the new set route, which, with the coach length swinging in an arc, would position it on the turntable. Then 2nd bogie over the point, reset, and pushed up on the outer line alongside the locos in the shed. Decline and closure In 1973 a new housing estate was planned covering the whole of the smallholdings area which forced the railway to move down to Crockway Farm, Maiden Newton, Dorset. A three-road shed with a pit was built, locomotives put inside and wagons pushed a few hundred yards over temporary welded track to a couple of sidings. But with the distance down to Crockway, , interest in restarting slowly waned. By 1978 all stock and signs were sold off in auctions arranged with the Narrow Gauge Railway Society. Some of the enthusiasts who had worked on the project went on to work for Network Rail, while others became the nucleus of the newly formed Swanage Railway Society.

They occur in tropical and subtropical South America and southern Central America (Panama and Costa Rica). Most are restricted to humid forest and adjacent habitats, but one species, the blaze-winged parakeet, prefers deciduous or gallery woodland, and another, the Pfrimer's parakeet, is restricted to dry regions. Some species are highly endangered. Depending on the species, the total length range from . All have long, pointed tails, a mainly green plumage, and a relatively narrow, dark greyish to white eye-ring. Many have scaly or barred chest-patterns and a whitish, pale grey, buff or reddish ear-patch. They typically move around in small, noisy flocks, flying swiftly at or below canopy level. Once settled in a tree they tend to be silent (especially if aware of danger) and difficult to spot. They nest in a tree-crevice. Some species are popular in aviculture, where they are commonly referred to conures instead of parakeets. The taxonomy of some groups, in particular the Pyrrhura picta and the P. leucotis complexes, has changed significantly in recent years. In late 2008 it was proposed that the members of the P. picta complex from north-eastern Peru (the so-called \\"group 6\\" in Joseph, 2002) should be considered a new species, the Amazon red-fronted parakeet, P. parvifrons.

The council was established by a decree of the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, on September 1, 2000.  History  The current State Council is the third in the history of Russia. It is the successor of the State Council of the USSR, which was the successor of the State Council (Russian Empire). The President signed the decree forming the State Council on the basis of articles 80 and 85 of the Constitution and the newly passed Federal Law ‚ÄúOn the Procedure for Forming the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation.‚Äù The President formed the State Council in order to harness the potential of regional leaders. In doing so, he took into account the requests and proposals of the Federation Council, the upper house of the Russian parliament members and State Duma deputies. In its capacity as an advisory body, the State Council aids the President in discharging his duties to ensure the concerted functioning and interaction of various governmental bodies. The Chairman of the State Council is the President of Russia. Upon his order, the acting Secretary of the State Council is currently one of the aides to the President, Alexander S. Abramov. The Presidential Domestic Affairs Directorate is responsible for the administrative support of the State Council. The Council is made up of the leaders (governors and presidents) of Russia‚Äôs Federal Subjects. Other persons may be appointed to the Council at the President‚Äôs discretion. On September 2, 2000, Putin established the Presidium of the State Council, whose task is to prepare for State Council sessions. The Presidium comprises the leaders of seven constituent territories representing each of the seven federal districts. Members of the Presidium rotate every six months, as envisaged by the regulations of the State Council and the Presidential Decree on the Council‚Äôs Presidium. The State Council considers issues of particular importance to the state, such as the development of governmental institutions, economic and social reforms and other objects affecting the public as a whole. The sessions are the principal medium for the work of the State Council and are held four times a year without a rigid timetable. Each session focuses on a single issue. On the eve of a session of the State Council, the Presidium meets to discuss the following day‚Äôs issue. It has also become accepted practice to discuss some issues at joint sessions of the State Council‚Äôs Presidium and the Security Council, sometimes with the participation of other presidential advisory bodies.

The painting shows a servant maid commenting to her mistress on a letter the woman holds. The painting is in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. Description The tied- up curtain in the foreground creates the impression that the viewer is looking at an intensely private, personal scene. There is also an element of trompe l'oeil as Dutch paintings were often hung with little curtains to conserve them, and the device of painted curtains is seen in other Dutch works of the period. The diagonals on the chequered floor create the impression of depth and three-dimensionality. The fact that it is a love letter that the woman has received is made clear by the fact that she is carryinga cittern, a form of lute used in the period as a symbol of love - often carnal love; luit was also a slang term for vagina. This idea is further reinforced by the slippers at the very bottom of the picture. The removed slipper was another symbol of sex. The floor brush would appear to represent domesticity, and its placement at the side of the painting may suggest that domestic concerns have been forgotten or pushed aside. The colors blue and gold are important in the composition of the painting. In the household that The Love Letter takes place in, gilded ornamentation indicates substantial wealth. The gold is located on the woman's dress, the top of the fireplace, and many of the objects, which complements the blue on the floor, the maid's dress, the picture frames, etc. Classical influence is also apparent in the ionic columns of the fireplace. The two paintings on the wall are also significant. The lower painting is of a stormy sea, a metaphor for tempestuous love. Above it is a landscape painting of a traveler on a sandy road. This may refer to the absence of the man who is writing to the lady.Patrick de Rynck, How to Read a Painting: Lessons from the Old Masters (Abrams: New York, 2004) Provenance In the second half of the 17th century, the painting probably found its place in the collection of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth's monarch John III Sobieski. The 1696 inventory of the Wilan√≥w Palace in Warsaw lists among Dutch paintings \\"a painting of a lady, playing a lute in a golden robe, while a girl gives her a letter in the black frames (obraz damy, grajƒÖcej na lutni w z≈Çotej szacie, a dziewczyna list jey oddaje w ramach czarnych)\\". Theft On September 23, 1971, the painting was stolen from its display at The Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels, where it was on loan from the Rijksmuseum. The thief, 21-year-old Mario Pierre Roymans, had locked himself in an electrical closet until the museum was closed. He then took the painting off the wall and tried to escape out of a window. However, when the frame failed to fit through the window, he cut the canvas from its frame with a potato peeler and hid the painting in his back pocket. Roymans first concealed the painting in his room at his place of work, The Soetewey (or Soete-Wey) Hotel. Later he buried it in a forest, but when it started to rain, he recovered it and hid it in his room inside his pillowcase. Roymans is thought to have been motivated by news of the bloodshed, rape, and murder of the 1971 Bangladesh genocide. On October 3, 1971, using the name \\"Tijl van Limburg\\" (a character similar to Robin Hood), Roymans contacted the Brussels newspaper Le Soir and asked for a reporter to meet him in a forest with a camera. He drove the reporter, blindfolded, to a church and unveiled the painting from a white cloth cover. After letting the reporter take photos of the canvas in the car's headlights, he drove him back. He told the reporter that he actually loved art, but also loved humanity. After the encounter, the pictures were published, alongside Roymans' conditions: 200 million Belgian francs to be given to famine-stricken Bengali refugees in East Pakistan. Roymans additionally requested the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and the Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels organize campaigns in their respective countries to raise money to combat world famine. Roymans set the deadline for these demands to be due Wednesday, October 6. The police took the photographs as evidence and asked an art expert to validate that they were of the actual painting. It was confirmed they were, but immediately after the confirmation, the director of the Rijksmuseum, Arthur van Schendel, said that the photos were not sufficient proof of authenticity. In the following days Roymans continued to make contact with the media; when he was finally apprehended by police, on the day of his deadline, trying to call a news station. The painting was returned to the Rijksmuseum on October 8 but wasn't announced to the public until October 11. It was in very poor condition after being cut crudely out of its stretcher bars and frame. The restoration took almost a year. Roymans was given a court fine and sentenced to two years in prison, but only served six months.

River courses and lake areas vary annually. River courses are not drawn completely outside park boundaries Kaziranga National Park is an Indian national park and an UNESCO World Heritage Site situated in the Golaghat and Nagaon district of Assam, India. It is a tourist destination and conservation area particularly notable as a refuge for the endangered Indian one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), hosting the largest population of wild Indian one-horned Rhinoceros in the world. The park contains significant stock of three other large herbivores -- the Asian Elephant, the Asiatic Water Buffalo and the eastern subspecies of the Swamp Deer. Kaziranga also has the highest density of tiger in the world and is declared a Tiger Reserve in 2006. Kaziranga is recognized as an Important Bird Area by Birdlife International for conservation of avifaunal species. Tourist activities The means of travel inside the park is on the back of trained elephants with mahout guides, or in Jeep or 4WD vehicles. Most rides are booked in advance and depart from the Park Administrative Centre in Kohora. The Park has three tourist routes under the jurisdiction of three Ranges ‚Äî Kohora, Bagori and Agaratoli. These roads are open to light vehicles from November to mid May. The park remains closed from mid-April to mid- October due to monsoon. Visitors willing to view wild life by motorcars are guided through these roads by the staff of this department. The visitors are allowed to take in their own vehicles, however no visitor is allowed to enter the park without an accompanying representative of the forest department. Observation towers are situated at Sohola, Mihimukh, Kathpara, Foliamari and Harmoti for spotting wildlife. Wildlife watching, including birding is the main activity inside the park. Viewing the scenic landscape of the park with different vegetation types interspersed with numerous beels and the snow- covered mountains of Himalayas at a distance constitute other attractions. Hiking in the park is not allowed taking into consideration the large number of potentially dangerous wild animals. An interpretation centre is being set up at the Bagori range of Kaziranga, to help the visitors know everything about the park. Lodging The park has a wide range of accommodation including rest houses, dormitory and lodges maintained by the Department of Environment and Forests, Government of Assam and the India Tourism Development Corporation. At present there are four Government tourist lodges of different categories at Kohora and three tourist lodges inside the park. Numerous private hotels are also available outside the borders of the park.

Assam State Transport Corporation and private buses stop here on their way to and from Guwahati, Tezpur and Upper Assam. Taxi Services also available from Guwahati to Kaziranga National Park and other places in Assam. The park is a 4-hour drive from Guwahati () on the NH-37 and 1.5 hrs from Nagaon (). Both these cities are well connected to the park by buses and taxies. Furkating ( away) is the nearest railway station, other important stations are Nagaon, Jorhat and Guwahati (GHY) stations. The nearest airports are Jorhat Airport ( away), Tezpur Airport at Salonibari (approx away) and Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport, Guwahati (approx. away). The nearest town from the park is Bokakhat ( away) and the nearest cities are Nagaon, Tezpur and Guwahati. Employment Tourism benefits the people living in the fringe of the park and helps in empowering the local people. About 35 hotels or lodges of various kinds located just outside the park, out of these, four are run by the government. A total of 299 local people are actively employed in these hotels. But, a very few hotels/lodges are owned by the local people. However, some families are offering home stay facilities just outside the park, so that the tourist may get a taste of the local life. People from the adjoining areas own 70 vehicles, which are allowed to be taken into the park, and most of them act as the driver cum guide. On the highway 37, which cuts across the park, 12 local community members own and run public phone booths. There are also 26 shops selling souvenirs etc. that are owned and/or managed by local community members. Many local women also regularly perform traditional dances at some of the larger hotels. Many sell locally handmade woven cloth to the tourist, which act as a money churner. There is tremendous scope for the sale of handicrafts in and around the park. Existing Self Help Groups (SHG) could very well provide a platform for such mechanisms. The Ministry of Tourism, Government of India along with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) are jointly supporting rural tourism in village of Durgapur, which falls in the periphery of the Kohora range of Kaziranga along with other initiatives at 31 sites across India. Local people do get some amount of employment from the park in the form of labour and allied activities. Labour requirements for the park include, labour for anti poaching activities and construction of bridges, culverts, etc. Approximately 100 to 200 people are hired per range for removal of Mimosa, a weed which is harmful for the herbivores. The park authorities have also hired 15 local people as security guard to protect the tourist jeeps inside the park. The park has developed a very good network of intelligence throughout the villages surrounding the park. There are key informants in every village, which reports about the movement of poachers and are monetarily compensated for information they provide to the park authorities.

The alignment of SD 19A was originally a portion of SD 19\\\\. Around 1950, the routing was changed so that SD 19 followed SD 46 for a stretch, bypassing Centerville to the south. At that time, the original route was given the SD 19A designation.

On merchant vessels, seafarers of various ranks and sometimes members of maritime trade unions are required by the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) to carry Merchant Mariner's Documents. King George V bestowed the title of the \\"Merchant Navy\\" on the British merchant shipping fleets following their service in the First World War; since then a number of other nations have also adopted use of that title or the similar \\"Merchant Marine\\". The following is a partial list of the merchant navies or merchant marines of various countries. In many countries the fleet's proper name is simply the capitalized version of the common noun (\\"Merchant Navy\\"). Merchant navies by country=British Merchant Navy= A recent example of British Merchant Navy officers, graduating at their 'passing out' ceremony from Warsash Maritime Academy in Southampton, with former First Sea Lord Alan West, Baron West of Spithead, in 2011. The British Merchant Navy comprises the British merchant ships that transport cargo and people during times of peace and war. For much of its history, the merchant navy was the largest merchant fleet in the world, but with the decline of the British Empire in the mid-20th century it slipped down the rankings. In 1939, the merchant navy was the largest in the world with 33% of total tonnage. By 2012, the merchant navy‚Äîstill remaining one of the largest in the world‚Äîheld only 3% of total tonnage. As of the year ending 2012, British Merchant Marine interests consists of 1,504 ships of or over. This includes ships either UK directly owned, parent owned or managed by a British company. This amounts to: or alternatively . This is according to the annual maritime shipping statistics provided by the British government and the Department for Transport. British shipping is represented nationally and globally by the UK Chamber of Shipping. =Canadian Merchant Navy= Canada, like several other Commonwealth nations, created its own merchant navy in a large-scale effort in World War II. Established in 1939, the Canadian Merchant Navy played a major role in the Battle of the Atlantic bolstering the Allies' merchant fleet due to high losses in the British Merchant Navy. Eventually thousands of Canadians served in the merchant navy aboard hundreds of Canadian merchant ships, notably the \\"Park Ship\\", the Canadian equivalent of the American \\"Liberty Ship\\". A school at St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia, trained Canadian merchant mariners. \\"Manning pools\\", merchant navy barracks, were built in Canadian ports. = Czechoslovakia & Czech Republic Greek Merchant Navy= Greece controls 23.2% of the world's total merchant fleet, making it the largest in the world. The Greek maritime fleet is today engaged in commerce and transportation of goods and services universally. It consists of the merchant vessels owned by Greek civilians, flying either the Greek flag or a flag of convenience. Greece is a maritime nation by tradition, as shipping is arguably the oldest form of occupation of the Greeks and a key element of Greek economic activity since ancient times. In 2015, the Greek Merchant Navy controlled the world's largest merchant fleet in terms of tonnage with a total DWT of 334,649,089 tons and a fleet of 5,226 Greek owned vessels, according to Lloyd's List. Greece is also ranked highly regarding all types of ships, including first for tankers and bulk carriers. =Indian Merchant Navy= The birth of the modern Indian Merchant Navy occurred before independence from the United Kingdom, when in 1919 SS Loyalty sailed from India to Britain. Today, India ranks 15th in the world in terms of total DWT. India currently supplies around 12.8% of officers and around 14.5% of ratings to the world seafaring community. This is one of the highest of any country. =New Zealand Merchant Navy= A portrait of a New Zealand Merchant Navy captain of a Fairmile 'submarine chaser', as he holds it up and looks through a small coloured screen. This disc allows him to look into the sky to search for dive bombers without damaging his eyes. In December 1939, 3,000 seafarers were employed and 186 merchant vessels were on the New Zealand Registry (many larger New Zealand vessels were however registered in London for insurance purposes). Some foreign vessels were impressed, including the four-masted barque, Pamir. New Zealand, like several other Commonwealth nations, created a merchant navy. However, the \\"wartime Merchant Navy was neither a military force nor a single coherent body\\", instead it was \\"a diverse collection of private companies and ships\\". Although some ships were involved in the Atlantic and North Pacific trade, mostly this involved domestic and South Pacific cargos. New Zealand- owned ships were involved in trade with the United Kingdom (84% of all New Zealand exports in 1939) and the majority of New Zealand seamen had served with the British Merchant Navy. Over the course of the war, 64 ships were sunk by enemy action on the New Zealand‚ÄìUK route,Neil Atkinson, Ed, 'Hell or High Water, New Zealand Merchant Seafarers Remember the War' Harper Collins, Auckland, 2009 and 140 merchant seafarers lost their lives (a similar number were also taken prisoner). =Pakistani Merchant Navy= The Pakistan Merchant Navy was formed in 1947. The Ministry of Port and Shipping, Mercantile Marine Department and Shipping Office established by the Government of Pakistan were authorized to flag the ships and also ensured that the vessels were sea worthy. All of the private shipping companies merged and formed the National Shipping Corporation (NSC) and the Pakistan Shipping Corporation (PSC) and as a result they had a common flag. Among these companies were the Muhammadi Steamship Company Limited and the East & West Steamship Company. In the Indo- Pak war of 1971 Pakistan suffered a great loss of its merchant vessels at the hands of Indians. On 1 January 1974, President of Pakistan Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto nationalized the National Shipping Corporation and Pakistan Shipping Corporation, and formed the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC) with the intent of reestablishing the Pakistan Merchant Navy. Later, the company was incorporated under the provisions of the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation Ordinance of 1979 and the Companies Ordinance of 1984. Today, the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation is the national flag carrier. The corporation's head office is located in Karachi. A regional office based in Lahore caters for upcountry shipping requirements. The corporation also has an extensive overseas network of agents looking after its worldwide shipping business. The Pakistan National Shipping Corporation also has several subsidiary companies. =Polish Merchant Navy= The Polish Merchant Navy (, PMH) was created in the interwar period when the Second Polish Republic regained independence. During World War II, many ships of the Polish Navy joined the Allied merchant navy and its convoys as part of the Polish contribution to World War II. After the war, the Polish Merchant Navy was controlled by the People's Republic of Poland and, after 1989, by modern Poland. , the PMH controlled 57 ships (of 1,000 GT or over) totaling / including 50 bulk carriers, two general cargo ships, two chemical tankers, one roll-on/roll-off ship and two short-sea passenger ships. =Swiss Merchant Marine= Switzerland, despite being a landlocked country, has a civilian high seas fleet of merchant vessels, whose home port is Basel, on the Rhine. The first ships were purchased and operated by the government in order to ensure the supply of critical resources during World War II. After the war, a privately owned merchant fleet emerged, spurred in part by government subsidies that paid for the fleet's operation up until 1953. As of 2006, 26 ships (mostly container carriers) totalling 479,624 tons, operated by five shipping companies, flew the Swiss flag. =U.S. Merchant Marine= Seal of the US Merchant Marine The United States Merchant Marine is made up of the nation's civilian-owner merchant ships and government owned ships military sealift command, NOAH, Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Homeland Security, and the men and women who crew them. The merchant marine transports cargo and passengers during peacetime. In time of war, the merchant marineMost English-speaking countries call their fleet the \\"merchant navy\\". Terms similar to merchant marine are used in, for example, the French Marine Marchande and the Spanish Marina Mercante. is an auxiliary to the navy and can be called upon to deliver troops and supplies for the military. The people of the merchant marine are called \\"merchant mariners\\", and are civilians except in times of war, when, in accordance with the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, they are considered military personnel. As of 2009, the U.S. merchant fleet numbered 422 shipsShips of tons or over. Fleet statistics from the 2009 CIA World Factbook and approximately 69,000 people. Not included in these numbers are the over 700 ships which are owned by American interests but are registered, or flagged, in other countries.

River Oaks Imaging & Diagnostic Group, 542 F. Supp. 2d 653 (S.D.

Background Izza Lopez was a transgender woman from Texas. Born Raul Lopez Jr., she had lived as a woman for many years. In September 2005, Lopez applied for a job as a scheduler at River Oaks Imaging & Diagnostic Group, using the name \\"Izza Lopez\\" on her r√©sum√© and job application. Following an interview Lopez was offered the position, subject to passing a drug screening and a background check. Lopez filled out the necessary paperwork for the checks using the name \\"Izza (Raul) Lopez\\". After Lopez had given notice at her current place of employment River Oaks rescinded the job offer. The reason give was her \\"misrepresentation\\" of herself as a woman. Lopez filed a discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which issued a \\"Notice of Right to Sue\\". Lopez filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Lambda Legal, an LGBT- interest public interest group, filed a discrimination lawsuit on Lopez's behalf. Lambda Legal's transgender law specialist Cole Thaler was lead attorney. Ken Upton, Lambda's senior staff attorney, assisted him. Outcome On April 3, 2008, District Judge Nancy F. Atlas ruled that \\"Lopez has stated a legally viable claim of discrimination as a male who failed to conform with traditional male stereotypes\\". Atlas dismissed River Oaks' motion for summary judgment and partially dismissed Lopez's motion for summary judgment, allowing the suit to proceed.

Patterson, 390 U.S. 102 (1968), is a United States Supreme Court decision which clarified the meaning and application of Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In a unanimous decision, the Court reversed the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and held that an automobile owner's interest in a suit against his insurer did not make him an \\"indispensable party\\" to that suit under Rule 19. The Court also made clear that Supreme Court precedent predating the enactment of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure did not create any substantive right in non-parties to be joined in case, as the Court of Appeals had apparently thought. Facts of the Case The case involved a somewhat complex set of facts arising from an automobile accident. Donald Cionci was driving a vehicle when he collided with a truck driven by Thomas Smith (Edward Dutcher, the automobile's owner, was not present when the accident occurred). John Harris and John Lynch were passengers in the automobile at the time of the crash. As a result of the collision, Cionci and Smith were killed, as was John Lynch. Harris, however, survived. Provident Tradesmens Bank, the administrator of Lynch's estate, sued the estate of Cionci (the car's driver) in federal district court pursuant to diversity jurisdiction. Cionci's estate, in turn, notified Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company, Dutcher's insurance company, alleging that Lumbermen's had a duty to defend pursuant to Dutcher's insurance policy. However, Lumbermens declined to defend Cionci's estate in the suit by Provident, asserting that Cionci had not had permission to drive Dutcher's vehicle and hence was not covered by the policy. The suit by Provident against the estate of Cionci was subsequently settled for $50,000 but Cionci, being penniless, could not pay. Apparently eyeing Lumbermen's deep pockets and armed with a liquidated $50,000 claim from its suit against Cionci's estate, Provident brought suit in federal district court seeking a declaration that Cionci had permission from Dutcher to use the automobile. The only named defendants in the declaratory action were Lumbermens and the estate of Cionci. David Dutcher, the owner of the vehicle and the beneficiary of the Lumbermens insurance policy, was not named as a defendant. The district court concluded that as a matter of applicable Pennsylvania law, the driver of an automobile is presumed to have the permission of the owner. Although the defendants sought to introduce testimony by Dutcher (the car's owner) concerning the restrictions he had imposed on Cionci's use of the automobile, the court held that under Pennsylvania's \\"Dead Man Rule\\" Dutcher was incompetent to testify, because his interests were adverse to that of Lynch's estate. Since there was no other evidence controverting the presumption of permission by Dutcher, the district court directed a verdict in favor of the Provident Tradesmens Bank. Lumbermens appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that because Dutcher was an indispensable party and was not joined in the initial action, the suit must be dismissed. It held (1) that a person's whose rights may be affected by a judgment has a \\"substantive\\" right to be joined in the action, (2) that a trial court may not proceed in that person's absence, and (3) that since Dutcher could not be joined without destroying the court's diversity jurisdiction, the suit had to be dismissed. The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari to address the scope of the newly amended Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Supreme Court Decision After reciting the full text of Rule 19, the Court assumed that Dutcher fell within the description in section (a) of persons who should be \\"joined if feasible.\\" However, because Dutcher was from the same state as the plaintiffs in the case (Pennsylvania), he could not be joined without depriving the federal courts of jurisdiction over the case. The Court then turned to the section (b) of Rule 19, which governs situations where joinder of the absent person is not feasible. The Rule articulates four factors to be considered by a court in deciding whether \\"in equity or good conscience the action should proceed among the parties before it, or should be dismissed.\\" The four factors were 1) the plaintiff's interest in an adequate forum, 2) the defendant's interest in avoiding relitigation of the issues before the court and in avoiding inconsistent and unfair relief, 3) the absent party's interests at stake, and 4) the interests of the court and the general public in complete, consistent, efficient settlement of controversies. The court noted that these factors should have been analyzed by the federal district courts before a judgment was issued. As a result of the fact that a judgment had already been entered, the court then analyzed the factors from the standpoint of an appellate review of the relief granted by the trial court. The court concluded that 1) the plaintiff's interest in preserving a fully litigated judgment was controlling unless countered by greater opposing considerations, 2) the defendants' interests in joining Dutcher were foreclosed by their failure to move for such a joinder before judgment was entered, 3) the absent party's interests were not foreclosed by his failure to be joined and the judgment entered by the trial court therefore does not bind him and causes his rights no harm as a result, and 4) the efficiency of the judiciary may have been benefitted from an attempt to find a more suitable forum for the controversy before judgment was entered but, after judgment was entered, efficiency would best be served upon appellate review by preserving the trial court's judgment. For the foregoing reasons, the Supreme Court determined that the case should not be dismissed because Dutcher's absence during trial would not violate any of his substantive rights. As a result of the four factor analysis, the Court ruled that Dutcher was a necessary party but not an indispensable party. The difference between the two is that a suit may proceed without the former but cannot proceed without the latter. The Supreme Court also noted that the district court had misinterpreted Shields v. Barrow to incorrectly assume that a case must be dismissed wherever the interests of an absent party were affected. The Supreme Court explained that where an absent party's interests were affected in a suit, the four factors enumerated above had to be analyzed to determine whether the suit should proceed without the party or be dismissed.

It features interviews with a range of cast and crew from the film. It is narrated by Roy Scheider and dedicated to Peter Benchley. The documentary was produced by Jaws fans over a seven-year period, building on Laurent Bouzereau's 1995 documentary, The Making of Jaws, that has been included on some laserdisc and DVD releases. Throughout other documentaries over the years, such as Bouzereau's and the BBC's 1997 documentary In the Teeth of Jaws, actor Richard Dreyfuss has recounted tales about the troubled production of Jaws and the quote ‚ÄúThe shark is NOT working‚Äù which Dreyfuss would hear constantly from members of the crew. Eventually, upon successful attempts to fix the malfunctioning sea monster, Dreyfuss would regularly hear the quote ‚ÄúThe shark is working.\\" Universal Studios announced that The Shark Is Still Working documentary would be included as a special feature on the Blu-ray edition of Jaws. Some of the interviews were filmed in 4:3 Academy ratio, typical of TV documentaries of the time. As the production went on, 16:9 became the TV shape standard and so the documentary crops the top and bottom of the image to reshape it to 16:9. There is no anamorphic enhancement of the documentary on the Jaws Blu-Ray. Crew The Shark Is Still Working was created by producers James Gelet, Jake Gove, Erik Hollander, and James-Michael Roddy, Co-Producer and Composer Michael McCormack, and Associate Producer Roy Scheider. Participants The documentary features rare footage and exclusive interviews with most of the cast and crew of Jaws, as well as celebrities whose careers have been influenced by the film. It was written by James Gelet, directed by Erik Hollander and narrated by Academy Award nominee Roy Scheider, who played Chief Brody. Among the more notable of those interviewed are Steven Spielberg, Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, John Williams, Peter Benchley (in what would be his final on-camera interview), Carl Gottlieb, Joe Alves, Richard Zanuck, David Brown, Susan Backlinie, Jeffrey Kramer, Ron & Valerie Taylor, Dick Warlock, Kevin Smith, Robert Rodriguez, Bryan Singer, Greg Nicotero, Tom Savini, Eli Roth, M.

From Mobridge to the Walworth‚ÄìPotter county line, this highway is part of the Lewis and Clark Trail. From about Timber Lake to just west of Mobridge, this highway is part of the Native American Scenic Byway. From the Montana state line to Camp Crook, the highway is a dirt road. SD 20 is composed of two disconnected segments. The longer western segment extends from Montana to Watertown. The much-shorter eastern segment extends from west of South Shore to Minnesota. However, the South Dakota Department of Transportation indicates that SD 20 follows US 212, US 81, and Interstate 29 (I-29) between the two segments. SD 20 originally extended from SD 45 west of Cresbard to Watertown. It was extended west to U.S. Route 83, southwest of Lowry. Later, it was extended to its current eastern terminus.

History SD 20 was established between 1929 and 1932. At this time, it extended from SD 45 west of Cresbard to Watertown. In the mid-1940s, it was extended westward to US 83 at the Walworth‚ÄìPotter county line. By 1953, a short stub was established between Akaska and US 83\\\\. Also, north of Watertown, a stub was added between US 81's former path (current western terminus of the eastern segment) and what was US 77 (now SD 15). In 1954, the highway was extended further to the east, from US 77 and the Minnesota state line, as it currently does. In the late 1960s, the stub between Akaska and US 83 was redesignated as SD 20 Spur. At this time, the SD 20 mainline was extended to its current western terminus, absorbing what had been SD 8 and later SD 18\\\\. Major intersectionsRelated routes=Highway 20A= Highway 20A (SD 20A) was an alternate route of SD 20\\\\. It was established around 1970. It originally traveled on the current path of SD 20 east of SD 15 through the Revillo area. A few years later, it was shifted to travel between US 77/SD 20, north-northeast of La Bolt, to the Minnesota state line, northeast of Albee. This highway was decommissioned at the end of the decade and was redesignated as SD 158\\\\. =Highway 20 Spur= Highway 20 Spur (SD 20 Spur) was a spur route of SD 20 that traveled from Akaska east to the SD 20 mainline. When this roadway was originally established in the early 1950s, it was part of the path of SD 20\\\\. It was redesignated as SD 20 Spur between 1965 and 1970, when SD 20 was shifted to its current path on U.S. Route 83 (US 83) in the area. The spur was further redesignated as SD 144 in 1976.

He was one of the first Soviet experts in skyscraper construction, notable for his collaboration with Arkady Mordvinov on Hotel Ukraina (Moscow). Oltarzhevsky, one of the few architects hit by the Great Purge in 1938, survived it and returned to active practice in 1940s. Biography Vyacheslav Oltarzhevsky was born in a family of a government official in Moscow. He studied architecture at Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture (1901‚Äì1908) and in Vienna under Otto Wagner (1905). He assisted older architects Ivan Rerberg, Illarion Ivanov-Shitz and Marian Peretyatkovich, and completed his first independent commission in 1909. His most visible building before World War I was the Northern Insurance in Kitai- gorod (shared with Rerberg and Peretyatkovich). In 1924-1934, Oltarzhevsky lived in United States with an official mission to study and evaluate modern construction technology, becoming the leading Soviet expert in highrise steel frame construction. Northern Insurance Society (1909-1911, Moscow). Architects: Marian Peretyatkovich, architects Ivan Rerberg, Vyacheslav Oltarzhevsky In 1935, Oltarzhevsky was appointed to be the chief architect of All-Russia Exhibition Centre; in April, 1936 his master plan was officially approved. By 1938, Oltarzhevsky completed most of this plan, notably the Mechanisatsia stepped tower, a predecessor of late stalinist architecture towers. The fall of Commissar for Agriculture, Mikhail Chernov, arrested in 1938 for Bukharin conspiracy, caused a domino effect in the Commissariat for Agriculture which supervised the Exhibition. Oltarzhevsky was arrested, too, but spared from death penalty and served his term in Vorkuta, as a town architect, until 1943. Meanwhile, his work at the Exhibition was branded alien art; some of his buildings were torn down and rebuilt from scratch. After World War II, Oltarzhevsky was assigned to the Moscow Skyscraper Project. His own plans were discarded, because all jobs were awarded in advance to most influential Soviet architects. Oltarzhevsky joined Arkady Mordvinov on his Hotel Ukraina skyscraper in Dorogomilovo District; both architects were awarded Stalin Prize in 1948 for conceptual drafts, before actual construction began. Before Ukraina was completed, Oltarzhevsky compiled his \\"Skyscraper Construction in Moscow (\\"–°—Ç—Ä–æ–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ –≤—ã—Å–æ—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö –∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–π –≤ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–µ\\", 1953), which remains a principal information source on late stalinist high-rise project.

However, The Sentinels comic series ended prematurely after four of five planned parts had been published. A purported follow up series by Antarctic Press, Robotech: Sentinels Rubicon, bore no resemblance to any previous (or subsequent) Robotech material, and was itself cancelled after only two issues. In 2005, the Waltrips picked up from where they left off with Robotech: Prelude to the Shadow Chronicles, a 5-part comic book miniseries which bridged their work on The Sentinels with the new animated film Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles. The Waltrips also inked Sokora Refugees for Tokyopop. Jason alone drew some stories for Djustine, Calavera and other adult comics created and written by Italian author Enrico Teodorani, published in Italy and the United States. The two have also had a lengthy career in webcomics. Jason has drawn Fans since 1999, and John drew the complete Rip and Teri. Jason replaced Gisele Lagace as the artist for the webcomic Penny and Aggie in 2008 and remained through the run of its spinoff, QUILTBAG. The two have reteamed to take over the art on the ongoing feature, Guilded Age, from 2010 to the present.

ID also provides consultancy and turn-key project commissioning for UAV systems. Background Integrated Dynamics supplies UAV platforms, flight control systems, C4I systems, data-links, payloads, ground support equipment and other accessories such as auxiliary power units, starters, battery management systems and launch/recovery systems. The company develop UAV models for both civilian and military uses on a 90,000 m¬≤ site, claiming to be \\"one of the largest UAV-dedicated R&D; and manufacturing enterprises.\\" ID has exported products to the US, Australia, Spain, South Korea and Libya. =Systems development= Integrated Dynamics claims that the bulk of its avionics and mission systems, including data and communications links, have been developed in-house. However, for smaller UAVs, ID is working with Colorado-based UAV Flight Systems to meet autopilot requirements. According to ID officials, development work in the tactical segment potentially allows the company to supply sub-systems and components, such as airframes, to other UAV manufacturers and users. This potential market is being pursued alongside full systems development. Civilian products * Border Eagle A low altitude, short range surveillance UAV intended for monitoring national borders, introduced in 2003.http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Unmanned-Aerial- Vehicles-and-Targets/Integrated-Dynamics-Border-Eagle-Pakistan.html Border Eagle Mk II is the latest updated version. Military products * Desert Hawk The Desert Hawk project was started in late 2003 to fulfil a requirement of the Pakistan Army, with the first prototype flying in late 2004. Designed to be capable of unpowered and powered flight using either an internal combustion engine or electric motor, the Desert Hawk looks much like the L-3 Communications-BAI Aerosystems Javelin UAV. Endurance of the Desert Hawk is approximately 2 hours. The standard system comprises a portable ground station and two UAVs. The line-of-sight data-link communication system is designed to get around terrain-masking problems by using one UAV as a communications relay station while the other UAV performs the mission. This capability was demonstrated in 2005 during the flight trials programme. Latest version is the Desert Hawk Mk II. * Firefly Integrated Dynamics began development of the Firefly mini-rocket UAV in late 2004 in response to the Pakistan Army operational requirements for a high speed, short range observation system that could be used in the high-altitude environments of northern Pakistan. A basic system costs around $3,000 and comprises four rockets, launcher, carry case, data-link and a PDA-based ground control station. The Firefly is powered by a commercially available miniature solid fuel rocket motor that gives a flight time of approximately 8 seconds. The UAV can cover 800-1,000 m (2,600‚Äì3,300 ft) before disintegrating on impact with the ground. The airframe is constructed from PVC plastic with glass-fibre fins for stabilisation. The payload is a fixed focal-length disposable CCD video camera and a 1.5 GHz L-band data-link. The UAV is launched by a hand-held \\"gun\\". Flight testing for the system began in mid-2005 and Firefly sub-systems were being used to support the development of a hand-launched micro-UAV. The new micro-UAV, based on a 200 mm (8 in) flying wing constructed from vacuum-moulded plastic, was due to start flight-testing in 2006. The micro-UAV is estimated to have a range of 1 km and endurance of approximately 30 minutes.FlightGlobal.com ‚Äì Asian UAV industry: Grand Plans (Firefly mini-rocket UAV) * Nishan A high speed aerial target/decoy drone. Latest version is the Nishan Mk II. * Tornado A small high speed decoy UAV system powered by a mini-turbojet.

Exports In late 2006 it was confirmed by ID that a number of Border Eagle Mk II UAVs had been supplied to Libya during the previous 2 years, although the deal may have been limited to airframes only rather than complete systems. According to a statement by the ID Chief Executive, Raja Sabri Khan, the Border Eagle Mk II is one of ID's most popular airframes and approximately 15‚Äì20 airframes have been exported to five countries, total value being $300,000.http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2006/12/12/211045/libya- acquires-pakistani-integrated-dynamics-border-eagle-uavs-over-two-year.html See also * Unmanned Aerial Vehicle * Miniature UAVs ;Related lists * List of unmanned aerial vehicles ReferencesExternal links * Integrated Dynamics official website * ;News articles * Dawn newspaper article ‚Äì Drones Made in Pakistan * FlightGlobal.com ‚Äì Asian UAV industry: Grand Plans (Firefly mini-rocket UAV) * The Daily (a Pakistani newspaper) ‚Äì Pakistan's private sector emerges with indigenous UAV technology ;Other articles * Pakistan's growing defence industry Category:Defence companies of Pakistan Category:Military research installations of Pakistan Category:Companies established in 1997 Category:Companies based in Karachi Category:Unmanned aerial vehicle manufacturers of Pakistan ","title":"Integrated Dynamics"},{"id":"10408870","text":"TJ Morris Ltd comprises several businesses, including Home Bargains, property ownership, and Far Eastern ventures.

He made his living conducting illegal sales of property he did not own, often New York's public landmarks, to unwary immigrants. The Brooklyn Bridge was the subject of several of his transactions, predicated on the notion of the buyer controlling access to the bridge. Police removed several of his victims from the bridge as they tried to erect toll booths. Sent to prison for life Early life Parker was born in New York City to Irish parents. He had four brothers and three sisters, and was a high school graduate.George C. Parker; Inmate; Sing Sing State Prison; Ossining, Westchester, New York; 1930 United States Federal Census Criminal career Parker used various names as a con man, including James J. O'Brien, Warden Kennedy, Mr. Roberts and Mr. Taylor. In addition to his Brooklyn Bridge scam, other public landmarks he incorporated into his scams included the original Madison Square Garden, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Grant's Tomb and the Statue of Liberty.Brian Lane, Crime & Detection, DK Eyewitness (NY, DK Publ'g, 2005) page 19. Parker had multiple methods for making his sales. When he sold Grant's Tomb, he would often pose as the general's grandson, and he set up a fake office to handle his real estate swindles. He produced convincing forged documents as evidence to suggest that he was the legal owner of whatever property he was selling. He also sold several successful shows and plays, of which he had no legal ownership. Parker was convicted of fraud three times. After one arrest, around 1908, he escaped the courthouse by calmly walking out after donning a sheriff's hat and coat that had been set down by a sheriff who had walked in from the cold outdoors. After his third conviction on December 17, 1928, he was sentenced to a mandatory life term at Sing Sing Prison by Judge Alonzo G. McLaughlin in the Kings County Court. He spent the last eight years of his life incarcerated there and was popular among guards and fellow inmates who enjoyed hearing of his exploits. Parker is remembered as one of the most successful con men in the history of the United States, as well as one of history's most talented hoaxers. His exploits have passed into popular culture, giving rise to phrases such as \\"and if you believe that, I have a bridge to sell you\\", to insinuate that someone is gullible.

It was also variously known as Polk's Corps, Hardee's Corps, and Cheatham's Corps. Background The units comprising the First Corps were drawn from the organization of Department No. 2 (or the Western Department) of the Confederate States, which held responsibility for defending the area between the Tennessee River and the Mississippi River.

Morrone () is a Scottish hill immediately southwest of the village of Braemar in Aberdeenshire.  Geography and topography  The hill reaches a height of 859 metres (2818 feet) and qualifies as a Corbett and a Marilyn, although with a topographic prominence of 155 metres,wikipedia - List of Marilyns in Southern Highlands. Gives prominence as 155 metres. it only just meets the prominence criterion for these categories. Morrone very much belongs to the village of Braemar from which it is usually climbed, and with a starting elevation of 330 metres, it is an easy ascent and a unique one, being the only significant mountain climb in Scotland to start from the centre of a village.\\"Climbing the Corbetts\\" Pages 150 (No mountain walk starts from a town). Morrone is used for the Braemar Gathering hill race every September, and is a popular venue for paragliding and hang-gliding. The hill is occasionally referred to as Morven and it is given both names on Ordnance Survey maps, although Hamish Brown says I‚Äôve never heard it called Morven.\\"Climbing the Corbetts\\" Pages 150 (Never heard it called Morven). In point of fact, the pronunciation of Morrone does not correspond closely with the pronunciation of M√≥r Shr√≤n, and the derivation of Morrone is a complex question. Watson and Allan come down on the side of M√≥r Bheinn.\\"The Place Names of Upper Deeside\\" Page 118 Morrone is not to be confused with Morven, the highest point in Caithness, or with the local Morven, a mere to the northeast. Morrone has a prominent profile, dominating the village of Braemar, and lives up to its name, which translates as Big Hill or Big Nose, but the hill is otherwise undistinguished, having few topographical highlights. It has a long south ridge, continuing from its summit over undulating ground to link with the Munro of An Socach nine kilometres to the south. Its eastern flanks are drained by the Coldrach Burn and the Allt Coire na Sgreuchaig, both flowing into the Clunie Water to join the River Dee just north of Braemar. The northern and western slopes are drained by a series of streams running directly into the Dee as it passes to the north of the hill. Morrone has three named but unexceptional corries on its slopes, the Coire Allt a' Chlair to the west of the summit, the Coire nam Muc to the north and the Coire na Sgreuchaig on the north eastern slopes.  Morrone Birkwood  The hill's lower northern slopes are the site of the Morrone Birkwood Special Area of Conservation, managed by Scottish Natural Heritage. Floristically unaltered since the end of the last ice age, it is the sole surviving example in Britain of a sub-alpine birch-juniper wood on basic soils.\\"The Past and Present Vegetation of the Morrone Birkwoods National Nature Reserve\\" (‚ÄúThe wood is the sole surviving example in Britain of a sub- alpine birch-juniper wood on basic soils‚Äú). It is also the most extensive and diverse example of a transition between woodland and juniper scrub in the UK. Some of the stands of juniper are the largest and most diverse in Scotland, and it has an extensive range of rare flora such as twinflower, interrupted club moss and globeflower. There are tufa-forming springs on the site, and it is the habitat of the endangered Geyer‚Äôs whorl snail. In the past the wood has been subject to high levels of grazing by deer, but since its declaration as a conservation area, the wood has been fenced to exclude deer and some natural regeneration has taken place.Joint Nature Conservation Committee. Gives rest of info on Morrone Birkwood.  Ascents and view  A Panoramic View From The Summit of Morrone. Morrone is usually climbed from the village of Braemar.\\"The Corbetts and Other Scottish Hills\\" Page 93 (Gives routes of ascent and descent). From the centre of the village, Chapel Brae is followed to the car park by the duck pond. From here a track goes south through the woods to reach a viewpoint with a plaque identifying the surrounding mountains. The main track swings right to the Birkwood, but the route is to the left for a hundred metres, and then takes a footpath on the right up the open hillside. It is then a two kilometre climb south west to the summit. Nearing the summit, one has a bird's-eye view of Braemar. The top of the hill is adorned with a radio mast and buildings dating from 1969, part of a University of Aberdeen research station. Braemar mountain rescue team also has a radio relay station on the summit.\\"Climbing the Corbetts\\" Pages 150 (Gives info on summit buildings and masts). At the highest point there is a trig point and a large cairn. The view is extensive, with an all-round mountain panorama from the Cairngorms to Lochnagar and the Glenshee Ski Centre. The descent from the mountain can be varied by following the vehicle track serving the summit structures, which runs south and then east to end on the old military road in Glen Clunie, from where it is a short walk back to Braemar.

The film generally traces the history of jazz music from the popularization of Ragtime in the early years of the 20th century to the acceptance of swing as an art form in the late 1930s using music composed by Berlin. The story spans more than two decades from the 1911 release of its name-sake song to some point in time after the 1933 release of \\"Heat Wave\\", presumably 1938. It stars Tyrone Power, Alice Faye, Don Ameche, Ethel Merman, Jack Haley and Jean Hersholt. Several actual events in the history of jazz are fictionalized and adapted to the story including the tour of Europe by Original Dixieland Jass Band, the global spread of jazz by U.S. soldiers during World War I, and the 1938 Carnegie Hall performance by The Benny Goodman Orchestra. The story was written by Berlin himself, with Kathryn Scola, Richard Sherman (1905‚Äì1962) and Lamar Trotti. However, in 1944, a federal judge ruled that most of the story by Berlin and collaborating writers had been plagiarized from a 1937 manuscript by author Marie Dieckhaus. Alexander's Ragtime Band was 20th Century Fox's most financially successful film of the 1930s and was nominated for six Academy Awards, winning the award for Best Music, Scoring.

Previously released songs were re- arranged and used in conjunction with new songs written by Berlin for the film. Reception From left to right: Jack Haley, Alice Faye, Don Ameche, Tyrone Power. The film had its New York premiere at the Roxy Theatre on August 5, 1938, with Cuban bandleader Desi Arnaz heading the stage show. Contemporary reviews from critics were positive. Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times wrote, \\"With those twenty-six Berlin tunes at its disposal and with such assured song-pluggers as Alice Faye and Ethel Merman to put them over, the picture simply runs roughshod over minor critical objection and demands recognition as the best musical show of the year.\\" Variety wrote, \\"Superlative in conception, execution and showmanship, it provides a rare theatrical and emotional experience.\\" Film Daily declared it \\"solid entertainment that should play to big returns.\\" Harrison's Reports called it \\"Excellent entertainment, capably directed and acted.\\" Russell Maloney of The New Yorker called the music \\"reason enough to see the film,\\" though he criticized the \\"small, persistent, mosquitolike irritation of the plot\\" and instances of anachronistic dialogue. Plagiarism lawsuit In 1937, composer Irving Berlin had been approached by 20th Century Fox to write a story treatment for an upcoming film entitled \\"Alexander's Ragtime Band.\\" Berlin agreed to write a story outline for the film which would feature many of Berlin's signature tunes. Released on August 5, 1938, Alexander's Ragtime Band was a smash hit with audiences and grossed in excess of five million dollars. However, soon after, a plagiarism lawsuit was filed by author Marie Cooper Dieckhaus against Berlin and 20th Century Fox. In 1944, a federal judge ruled in Dieckhaus' favor that Berlin and collaborating writers had plagiarized a 1937 manuscript by Dieckhaus and used many of its elements. In 1937, Dieckhaus had submitted her manuscript to various Hollywood studio heads, literary agents, and other individuals for their perusal. Despite rejecting her work, much of her manuscript's plot was nonetheless appropriated for the film's screenplay. In 1946, the ruling was reversed on appeal.

It starts at the Cooum Creek, south of Fort St George, leading in a south-westerly direction towards St. Thomas Mount, and ends at the Kathipara Junction in Guindy. Beyond the Kathipara Junction, a branch road arises traversing westwards to Poonamallee to form the Mount-Poonamallee Road while the main branch continuing southwards to Chennai Airport, Tambaram and beyond to form Grand Southern Trunk Road (GST Road or NH45). Anna Salai, which is more than 400 years old, is acknowledged as the most important road in Chennai city. The head offices of many commercial enterprises and public buildings are located along Anna Salai. It is the second longest road in Chennai, after Poonamallee High Road. There were several flyover projects under proposal along the stretch, many of which have been shelved owing to the construction of the Chennai Metro Rail project, which runs along the median of the road. Anna Salai Head Post office, one of the most important post offices in the city, is located on this road. It was established in 1854 as Mount Road SO as a non-gazetted delivery office. With the growth of commerce and urbanization, this SO was upgraded to gazetted in the year 1955. Nomenclature of this Head Post office was changed from Mount Road Head Post office to Anna Road Head Post office on 15 September 1974. History Mount Road in 1900 Anna Salai is more than 400 years old, and has its origins in a cart track which was used by the European employees of the British East India Company to travel from the factory at Fort St George to the holy town of St Thomas Mount where the apostle St Thomas was crucified. The road, in its present form, took shape during the time of Charles Macartney who served as Governor of Madras. With the construction of Marmalong Bridge in 1724, the road started gaining prominence. In the following years, the road became part of the city's central business district which originally covered only George Town. Today, most of Chennai's business and corporate offices are located on Anna Salai. In the 1700s, the road was lined with garden houses and large colonial mansions with balconies and verandas set amidst lush gardens. By the 1800s, Mount Road has become the traders' area of the city of Madras while First Line Beach in Georgetown remained the seat of processing, shipping and manufacturing businesses. However, the business activities of Mount Road was responsible for the city's economic growth. Several giant firms had beginnings on Mount Road, from the Amalgamations group to the TVS group. The road's proximity to the Government House, the home of the Governor, and the palaces of the Nawabs of Arcot resulted in several firms selling cars and other luxury goods setting up shops on the road. Simpson & Co, which moved to its current location opposite Government Estate after 1875, began building carriages and coaches and then cars. In the early 1900s, the road became the entertainment hub for the British. In 1903, the first steam-driven car was taken for its debut drive on Mount Road. To overcome the Great Depression of the 1930s, Simpon's introduced the hire purchase system for cars and trucks. In the 1930s, the TVS group, which was a travel operator in mofussil areas, was established in Madras by acquiring the Madras Auto Service property. In the 1940s, Anantharamakrishnan helped with the formation of Amalgamations & Co. The city's first skyscraper, the LIC Building, was built in 1959. Several major firms were then established, namely, Spencers & Co, Victoria Family Hotel (the present location of the Indian Overseas Bank Headquarters) and Higginbothams. The Stretch Thomas Munro in The Island, Chennai Anna Salai starts from the Parktown area of Chennai city where Chennai Central railway terminus is situated. It, then, traverses the Island with its statue of Sir Thomas Munro to the other side of the Coovum before entering the neighbourhoods of Thousand Lights and Teynampet areas. From Teynampet, it continues straight southwards to Nandanam and Saidapet before traversing the Maraimalai Adigal Bridge across the Adyar River to Little Mount and finally, Guindy. Anna Salai is maintained by the Tamil Nadu Highways Department. The road extends for a total of 11 kilometres and traverses the heart of the city. By the 2010s, the stretch between Parry's Corner and Nandanam was used by over 16,000 vehicles during rush hour. Anna Salai is used by over 0.183 million vehicles every day. The Metropolitan Transport Corporation in Anna Salai carries about 14,000 passengers per hour per direction. Safety level Anna Salai remains the road in the city experiencing second most number of accidents annually, next only to Jawaharlal Nehru Road (100 ft Inner Ring Road), with one person being injured every 1.13 days. Together, these roads account for almost 14 per cent of the 5,101 accidents that occurred in Chennai in 2010.

It first aired on 26 October 1975 on ITV. Background Such a Lovely Man was recorded in the studio on 17 and 18 April 1975. John Hawkesworth and Alfred Shaughnessy wished an episode to revolve around Hannah Gordon's character Virginia, and Rosemary Anne Sisson wrote Such A Lovely Man. The character of Sir Guy Paynter was inspired by Sir Philip Sassoon, who was the Conservative Member of Parliament for Hythe from 1912 until his death in 1939, and cousin of Siegfried Sassoon.

He thinks that Sir Guy Paynter, a wealthy and influential industrialist who is also a bachelor, would be able to use his influence to help Richard obtain the post. Virginia agrees, and invites Sir Guy to lunch. However, the lunch ends abruptly when Sir Guy makes a comment regarding death by firing squad for cowardice, not knowing that Virginia's son Michael was court-martialed for such an offense, but reprimanded, sent back into action, and killed. A few days later, Sir Guy sends flowers to Virginia to apologise, and he then takes her to a luncheon. As a thank you, he gives her a signed first edition of Browning's poems. Virginia then agrees to attend a weekend at Shelburne while Richard is in Paris. Richard tells James that he does not mind Virginia spending time with Sir Guy, but warns him that he is not the \\"marrying kind\\". On the Sunday night, all the other guests leave, leaving Sir Guy and Virginia alone. Virginia then drops hints about the Foreign Office post. Shortly after, the gossip columns of the newspapers are filled with rumours about the pair. Richard then asks Virginia not to see so much of him, and Virginia then turns down Sir Guy's invitation to holiday with him. He then comes round and asks for the Browning book back, saying he lent it to her. Moments later, Richard arrives and says he has been offered the post of Under- Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs by Stanley Baldwin. Baldwin had received a note from Sir Guy recommending someone else, saying Richard was too old, and this made Baldwin decide on Richard as he does not like people being in Sir Guy's pocket. Meanwhile, Ruby answers a newspaper advert for pen pals, and she chooses to write to a Herbert Turner, a 35-year-old post office clerk who lives with his parents in Balham. They soon go to the cinema, and Hudson and Mrs Bridges invite him round for Sunday tea. A few weeks after first meeting, Turner asks Ruby to marry him, but she turns him down, partly because he does not look enough like Rudolph Valentino.

Before accepting his role as a columnist, the native of New York City and Brooklyn College graduate was a theater and television critic, and also served as a copy editor and features writer. Bykofsky is a member of the Society of Professional Journalists, the National Society of Newspaper Columnists and Philadelphia's Pen & Pencil Club. In 1991, Bykofsky created what would become his signature event, the Candidates Comedy Night during which candidates for political office would get onstage and try to win laughs. Those entertaining included candidates for mayor, U.S. Congress, U.S. Senate, judicial offices and governor among others. During the 25 years it existed, the event raised $500,000 for the Variety Club, the children's charity. \\"Another 9/11\\" comment In August 2007, Bykofsky wrote a controversial article that in which he declared that \\"one month from The Anniversary, I'm thinking another 9/11 would help America\\" in order to \\"quell the chattering of chipmunks and to restore America's righteous rage and singular purpose to prevail.\\" Reactions to this article were largely negative. Several commentators were offended that Bykofsky would suggest that more innocent Americans should die for the sake of national unity. However, Fox News host John Gibson agreed with Bykofsky and said, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs going to take a lot of dead people to wake America up.‚Äù  Other work  Since 2011, he wrote columns to get an incarcerated murderer the sentence he had agreed to in a plea bargain but was denied. He also advocated for Philadelphia school children who excel in school to get VIP tickets to mayor's boxes. Bykofsky also wrote an expose of the city animal shelter that led to City Council hearings, removal of the management team and complete reform. Keith Olbermann hoax In November 2010, Bykofsky attempted to contact Keith Olbermann for comment by emailing keith@keitholbermann.com. The responses, which came from someone at The Daily Caller, not from Olbermann, were attributed to Olbermann when published on the website Phawker.com; subsequently a retraction was printed.

North Hatley, a resort town on Lake Massawippi, owes most of its grand houses and particular architecture to the first summer people ‚Äì aristocrats, captains of industry and large landowners, mostly Americans from the South. For some time after the American Civil War (1861-1865) many wealthy southerners renounced New England (Yankeeland) as a summer retreat and continued further North into Canada, some by private railway car. Legend has it that many drew their blinds in passing through New England. These new arrivals brought their lifestyles with them ‚Äì butlers and servants, horses and carriages, and the gentlemanly sports of golf, sailing and tennis. Around 1895 they started to build on the west side of the lake. Their summer homes were large, many with over 15 rooms. Some continue in the hands of the same American families, who continue to summer here, others have been converted to inns or bed and breakfasts. That, in fact, is what happened to the grandest of all summer homes, called The Birches. Built in 1900 by Henry Atkinson, from Atlanta, with a broad porch and white pillars (copied from George Washington's home at Mount Vernon, Virginia), it was later renamed Hovey Manor and is today the town's most luxurious inn. As a private estate, the grand house had its own stables and coach house, servants' quarters and even a private nine-hole golf course which is rumoured to have been designed by Bobby Jones Sr., a friend of the Atkinsons. Many of these spaces, including the old ice house and servants' quarters have since been converted into guest rooms. Manoir Hovey draws thousands of vacationers each year. The mansion is surrounded by of woods and English gardens. Its of lake front include two sandy beaches equipped with canoes, kayaks and paddle boards.

Alice Chestre made major donations to the church. The north-east tower was added in 1716 by William Paul, and completed by George Townesend. The lantern was rebuilt by Luke Henwood in 1807, and the chancel rebuilt in the mid-19th century. The Kalendars, a brotherhood of clergy and laity attached to All Saints, built a library over the north aisle of the church in the fifteenth century; by a deed of 1464 they gave free access to all who wished to study. This was the first 'public' library in the kingdom. In 1466 fire destroyed many of the manuscript books. The church is surrounded on three sides by pedestrian passageways and built into surrounding buildings. Over the south nave is a priests' room and over the north a Georgian coffee room. The most notable monument marks the grave of Edward Colston, the slave trader and philanthropist. It was designed by James Gibbs and carved by John Michael Rysbrack.

Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2010-2011 school year is 2.9 percent, but it can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines.

A single example, A-1, was constructed at the Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant in Jaslovsk√© Bohunice, Czechoslovakia. The power plant suffered a series of accidents, the worst being an accident on February 22, 1977 rated INES-4. Since 1979 the plant has been undergoing decommissioning. History The decision to build a nuclear power plant in Czechoslovakia was made in 1956. Construction of A-1 in Jaslovsk√© Bohunice (western Slovakia) started in 1958 and took an unexpected 16 years. A-1 was commissioned on October 24, 1972. The KS 150 reactor was built entirely in Czechoslovakia, designed together with USSR, built by ≈†koda Works. One advantage of the design was its ability to use unenriched uranium mined in Czechoslovakia, similar to a CANDU reactor. Because of its experimental design the power plant suffered from accidents resulting in over 30 unplanned shutdowns. On January 5, 1976 two workers were killed due to a leak of carbon dioxide, which was used as a coolant. A 'technical' (mechanical?) failure occurred during refuelling and a fresh fuel assembly was shot off the reactor into the reactor's hall. The most serious accident from 1977 (see below) was rated INES-4. The damage could have been repaired with a large investment but on May 17, 1979 the government, dissatisfied with high costs, low performance and accidents, decided to decommission the plant. Plans to build the second reactor block A-2 were canceled. The accidents were kept secret, although wild stories circulated among the public. A1 Nuclear Power Plant was in operation for 19,261 hours altogether, it generated 1,464 GWh and supplied 916 GWh to the network. Maximum output achieved was 127 MW. Decommissioning, decontamination and dismantling of the plant still continues and is expected to be completed in 2033. Technical details KS 150 is a heavy water moderated, gas cooled reactor (HWGCR) able to refuel during operation. Seventy metal uranium wires, each clad in a compound of magnesium and beryllium, are bundled together to form a fuel rod. The reactor's pressure vessel is of 15 cm carbon steel in a cylindrical shape with diameter 5.1 m and height 20 m. Within the pressure vessel (in the active zone) is a cylindrical vessel of aluminium- magnesium- silicon alloy for the heavy water moderator. Fuel channels are vertical, each containing a single fuel rod cooled with circulating carbon dioxide. The core is in a pressurized vessel to allow refuelling during operation. The heavy water moderator is cooled in a separate circuit. Carbon Dioxide gas used as a primary coolant is streamed around the fuel rods. After being heated by the rods it is piped to six steam generators. The resulting steam powers three turbogenerators. * Fuel: unenriched metal uranium, 23.1 tonnes in the reactor. * Core: diameter 3.56 m, height 4 m. * Coolant gas on exit from reactor: pressure 5.4 MPa (~54 atm), temperature 426¬∞C. * Conversion efficiency: 18.5%. * Moderating heavy water: temperature 65¬∞C (Max/exit 90¬∞C) * Capacity: 143 MWe. 1977 accident On February 22, 1977, during a fuel change, a combination of human mistakes and design problems caused the worst nuclear accident in Czechoslovak history. Some fuel rods were being replaced while the reactor was active in a standard procedure. In this instance however humidity absorbers covering the rods were not removed, causing local overheating of the fuel (since transmission of heat to the coolant gas was reduced). The active zone was damaged, heavy water came into contact with the coolant and both primary and secondary circuits were contaminated. The accident was rated as level 4 on International Nuclear Event Scale (in comparison, the Three Mile Island accident was rated level 5). 25% of the fuel elements in a heavy water moderated carbon dioxide cooled 100 MW(e) power reactor were damaged due to operator error. The operators failed to remove silica gel pellets that has fallen into a new fuel element from a damaged pack (there was no procedure available to check the interior of fuel element, therefore only pellets from the top were removed). The silica gel packs were used to keep the unused fuel dry during storage and transport. The silica gel pellets blocked the flow of the coolant resulting in overheating of the fuel and the pressure channel holding it. As a result of overheating the heavy water leaked into the part of the reactor (the gas circuit) where the fuel elements are accommodated, the fuel cladding was subject to corrosion and a considerable amount of radioactivity leaked into the primary cooling circuit (CO2 gas). Through leaks in the steam boilers (similar basic design to a MAGNOX or AGR plant) some parts of the secondary circuit became contaminated.Page 300, Radioactivity, Ionizing Radiation and Nuclear Energy, Ji≈ï√≠ H√°la and James D.

On the left and right of the image can be seen the surrounding shops on Broad Street. The image shows 4 children and a cat in a street scene. Christ Church was built between 1786 and 1791. The tower appears to have been designed by Thomas Paty who was architect to the vestry, and the body of the church by his son William, and built by Thomas Paty and Sons, replacing a medieval one. The entrance and refurbished interior are by Henry Williams in 1883. The building was restored by Priest-in-charge Rev. G. S. Zimmern in 1973. On the tower quarter-boy figures strike the quarter hours on the Automaton clock. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building. Clock on the tower St Ewen's Church St Ewen's church was on the north west corner of the medieval cross- roads, opposite Christ Church on Broad Street. A charter of Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury, confirming a vicar called Turstin at the church and threatening that anyone who interfered with the post would be ‚Äúfirmly bound up in the chains of anathema‚Äù, is known as the Charter of Theobald or the Curse of St Ewen. It dates to about 1141 and is the oldest document held by Bristol Archives. The church was founded in the early 1100s but the parish was joined with that of Christ Church in 1790. The church was demolished in 1820 to make space for the enlargement of the old Council House, now Bristol Register Office. Building The current Baroque style building, of Bath stone, was designed by William Paty and built between 1786 and 1791. A Victorian restoration was carried out in 1883 by Henry Williams. Worship Worship at Christ Church follows the 1662 Book of Common Prayer and the parish supports the work of the Prayer Book Society in promoting the use of traditional liturgy throughout the Church of England. Scripture readings are taken from the Authorised Version of the Bible. The Parochial Church Council has passed Resolutions A, B and C and does not accept the ministry of women priests.Parish website See also * Churches in Bristol * Dorothy Hazard, wife of a Puritan preacher named Matthew Hazard * Grade II* listed buildings in Bristol References External links  * Christ Church on ChurchCrawler * St Ewen's Church on ChurchCrawler Category:Churches completed in 1791 Category:Anglican congregations established in the 18th century Christ Church with St Ewen Christ Church with St Ewen Category:Georgian architecture in Bristol Category:Grade II* listed churches in Bristol Category:18th-century Church of England church buildings ","title":"Christ Church with St Ewen, Bristol"},{"id":"10409250","text":"A * A.

Located in Cumberland, Ohio, the Wilds is home to rare and endangered species from the globe living in natural, open-range habitats. The property encompasses of reclaimed coal mine land and includes of pastures and a Carnivore Conservation Center. The Wilds is designated an Audubon Important Bird Area so the property includes a birding station with covered lookout as well as a butterfly habitat with hiking trails, more than of mountain bike and hiking trails and approximately 150 lakes. The Wilds is the largest wildlife conservation center in North America and is open between the months of May and October. The Park was made on reclaimed land dug by the dragline Big Muskie. History The open air safari vehicle used to transport visitors through the facility. Location Map In 1984, the Wilds was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit under the name The International Center for the Preservation of Wild Animals, Inc. (ICPWA), formalizing a public- private partnership involving the Ohio Departments of Natural Resources and Development, the Ohio Zoos and the private sector that formed in the late-1970s. That same year, the Wilds was gifted its current from the Central Ohio Coal Company. With a location secured, the Wilds began hiring employees, planning development, and organizing fundraising support. In 1989, the Johnson Visitor Center was completed, built with the environment in mind using a state-of-the-art geothermal heating and cooling system. In 1990, the first animal management facilities and fencing of the initial open range began. These projects allowed for the Wilds to receive its first animals, Przewalski‚Äôs horses in 1992. The Wilds officially opened to the public for tours in 1994. For the next few years, it continued to add animals, improve and expand conservation efforts, and increase public awareness. In 2001, the Wilds began its partnership with the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. This culminated in the completion of the first Strategic Vision Plan in 2005, designed to guide the success and future development of the Wilds for the future. Today, the Wilds continues working on its mission to advance conservation through science, education and personal experience. Strategic plan In 2005, the Wilds initiated its long-term strategic plan, which is broken into \\"strategic centers\\" to facilitate progress in each field. These \\"centers\\" are based on the Wilds' core values, which include a commitment and respect for nature, social and scientific relevance, and innovative, entrepreneurial and creative approaches to the problem at hand. The strategic centers are focused on animal management, science and research, conservation education & professional training, land stewardship and habitat management, personal experience, institutional partnerships, and resource development & sustainability. Conservation The Wilds is involved in many different conservation methods in an attempt to help reduce the decline of wildlife habitats. These methods range from professional training to animal husbandry to conservation medicine. In order to help the development of conservation medicine, The Wilds has started three projects they hope will be models for the conservation medicine initiative as a whole. These include assessing water quality and its effects on marine life, comparing animal health parameters in multiple habitats, and evaluating fresh water mussels for diseases, parasites and toxins. Each of these projects is designed to assess the condition of various wildlife and their habitats, and to develop methods to reduce or reverse the destruction of each ecosystem.

Born in Kilkenny, Larkin first played competitive hurling during his schooling at Kilkenny City Vocational School. He arrive don the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team. He made his senior debut during the 1962‚Äì63 league. Larkin went on to enjoy a lengthy career with the team, winning five All-Ireland medals, nine Leinster medals and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on three occasions. As a member of the Leinster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Larkin won five Railway Cup medals. At club level he is a two- time All-Ireland medallist with James Stephens. In addition to this he also won two Leinster medals and a grand total of seven championship medals as a dual player. His father, Paddy, and his son, Philly, also enjoyed multiple All-Ireland successes with Kilkenny. Throughout his career Larkin made 35 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling prior to the start of the 1980 championship. In retirement from playing Larkin became involved in team management and coaching. As well as a brief spell as manager of the Kilkenny senior team, he also served as an inter-county and club selector. During his playing days, Larkin won four All-Star awards, while he was also chosen on a special supreme All-Star team. Larkin was named at right corner-back on the Kilkenny Hurling Team of the Century, while he was also chosen as one of the 125 greatest hurlers of all-time in a 2009 poll. Playing career=Club= Larkin first tasted club success as a Gaelic footballer with Clann na Gael in 1962. Having lost the original fixture a replay was ordered following a Clann na Gael objection. A 2‚Äì7 to 2‚Äì3 defeat of St. Senan's gave Larkin a junior championship medal. After making the step up to the senior ranks in 1963, Clann na Gael continued their winning ways. A 1‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì2 defeat of Lamogue gave Larkin a first senior football championship medal. In 1964 Clann na Gael and Lamogue faced each other in the championship decider once again. In a much closer affair both sides finished level. Clann na Gael went on to win the replay by 3‚Äì3 to 0‚Äì4, giving Larkin a second championship medal. In 1969 Larkin was in the last line of defence as James Stephens qualified for the senior hurling championship decider for the first time in over thirty years. Fenians provided the opposition, however, the game was delayed until 19 April 1970. Three goals and two points in a devastating opening five minutes paved the way for a comfortable 5‚Äì2 to 1‚Äì4 half-time lead. James Stephens completed their rout of the Fenians in the second half and recorded an 8‚Äì5 to 2‚Äì7 victory. It was Larkin's first championship medal. Defeat at the hands of the Fenians followed for Larkin's side in 1970 and 1973, however, James Stephens made another breakthrough in 1975. A 1‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì5 defeat of first-time finalists Galmoy gave Larkin a second championship medal. James Stephens subsequently qualified for the provincial decider, with Offaly champions St. Rynagh's providing the opposition. James Stephens took the lead from the third minute, with Liam \\"Chunky\\" O'Brien being scorer-in-chief. A 1‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì4 victory gave Larkin his first Leinster medal. Two-time champions and hot favourites Blackrock provided the opposition in the subsequent All- Ireland decider. \\"The Rockies\\" got off to the better start, with two goals by √âamonn O'Donoghue and Pat Moylan giving them a 2‚Äì1 lead at the quarter mark. James Stephens trailed at the interval but were transformed in the second half. A 2‚Äì10 to 2‚Äì4 victory gave Larkin his first All-Ireland medal. Larkin collected a third championship medal in 1976 as Rower-Inistioge were accounted for by 2‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì13. It was a successful year for the James Stephens senior football team also. A 1‚Äì9 to 0‚Äì6 defeat of Railyard gave Larkin a third football championship medal. After a period of decline, James Stephens bounced back in 1981. A double scores 2‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì8 defeat of Fenians gave Larkin a fourth championship medal. He later collected a second Leinster medal as championship debutantes Faythe Harriers were narrowly defeated by 0‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì9. First time finalists Mount Sion of Waterford provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland decider. A hat-trick of goals by John McCormack, together with a ten-point haul from Billy Walton, saw James Stephens fight back from seven points down to record a 3‚Äì13 to 3‚Äì8 victory. It was a second All-Ireland medal for Larkin. =Inter-county=Minor Larkin was seventeen years-old when he was called up to the Kilkenny minor team in 1959. He won a Leinster medal that year following a 7‚Äì9 to 3‚Äì4 trouncing of Wexford. He later lined out in the All-Ireland final, with near rivals Tipperary providing the opposition once again. A narrow 2‚Äì8 to 2‚Äì7 defeat denied Larkin, who had to retire early due to injury, an All-Ireland medal. Early successes Three years later in 1962 Larkin made his senior competitive debut in a National Hurling League game against Tipperary. He was later included on Kilkenny's championship panel and won his first Leinster medal following a 2‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì9 defeat of Dublin. This victory allowed Kilkenny to advance directly into an All-Ireland showdown with Waterford on 1 September 1963. \\"The Cats\\" entered the game as underdogs, however, ace marksman Eddie Keher proved to be the difference with a magnificent display in which he scored fourteen points. Despite a hat-trick of goals from Waterford's S√©amus Power, Kilkenny secured a 4‚Äì17 to 6‚Äì8 victory. It was Larkin's first All- Ireland medal. Larkin added a second Leinster medal to his collection in 1964 as Dublin were defeated on a 4‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì8 score line. The All-Ireland final on 6 September 1964 saw Kilkenny enter the game as firm favourites against fierce rivals Tipperary. John McKenna scored Tipp's first goal after ten minutes as the Munster champions took a 1‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì6 interval lead. The second half saw Tipperary score goals for fun, with Donie Nealon getting a hat-trick and Se√°n McLoughlin another. Kilkenny were humiliated at the full-time whistle as Tipperary triumphed by 5‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì8. After surrendering their provincial crown in 1965, Kilkenny bounced back the following year, however, Larkin was dropped from the team. Return to the team During Larkin's absence from the team Kilkenny won two more All-Ireland titles, however, he returned to the starting fifteen in 1971 as \\"the Cats\\" began their complete dominance of the provincial championship. A 6‚Äì16 to 3‚Äì16 defeat of Wexford gave Larkin his third Leinster medal. On 5 September 1971 Kilkenny faced Tipperary in the All- Ireland final, the first to be broadcast in colour by Telef√≠s √âireann and the only eighty-minute meeting between the two sides. Kilkenny's ever-dependable goalkeeper, Ollie Walsh, had a nightmare of a game in which he conceded five goals, one of which passed through his legs, while that year's Hurler of the Year and Larkin's direct opponent, \\"Babs\\" Keating, played out the closing stages of the game in his bare feet. Eddie Keher set a new record by scoring 2‚Äì11, however, it wasn't enough as Tipperary emerged the victors on a score line of 5‚Äì17 to 5‚Äì14. In 1972 Larkin won a fourth Leinster medal following a thrilling draw and replay victory over Wexford. Cork provided the opposition in the All-Ireland final on 3 September 1972, a game which is often considered to be one of the classic games of the modern era. Halfway through the second- half Cork were on form and stretched their lead to eight points. \\"The Rebels\\" failed to score again as Kilkenny went on to claim a remarkable 3‚Äì24 to 5‚Äì11 victory. Larkin added a fifth Leinster medal to his collection in 1973 following a 4‚Äì22 to 3‚Äì15 defeat of Wexford. On 2 September 1973 Kilkenny faced Limerick in the All-Ireland decider. The game hung in the balance for the first-half, however, eight minutes after the restart Mossie Dowling got a vital goal for Limerick. Shortly after this Richie Bennis spearheaded a rampant Limerick attack which resulted in a 1‚Äì21 to 1‚Äì14 victory for Limerick. In spite if this defeat Larkin finished off the year by winning his first All- Star. Wexford were, once again, narrowly defeated by Kilkenny in the 1974 provincial decider. The remarkable 6‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì24 victory gave Larkin a sixth Leinster medal. In a repeat of the previous year Limerick provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final on 1 September 1974. The Munster champions stormed to a five-point lead in the first eleven minutes, however, a converted penalty by Eddie Keher, supplemented by two further goals gave Kilkenny a 3‚Äì19 to 1‚Äì13 victory and gave Larkin a third All-Ireland medal. He later won a second All-Star award. Kilkenny made it five successive provincial titles in-a-row in 1975. The 2‚Äì20 to 2‚Äì14 defeat of Wexford gave Larkin his seventh Leinster medal. On 7 September 1975, Larkin lined out in another All-Ireland final, with surprise semi-final winners Galway providing the opposition. Playing with the wind in the first half, Galway found themselves ahead by 0‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì3 at the interval. Eddie Keher's huge tally of 2‚Äì7 kept Galway at bay giving Kilkenny a 2‚Äì22 to 2‚Äì10 victory. He later added a fifth successive All-Star award to his collection. Twilight In 1976 Larkin was appointed captain of the team as Kilkenny looked a sure bet to capture a third successive All-Ireland crown. The season began well with Larkin winning a National League medal following a 6‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì14 trouncing of Clare in a replay. Kilkenny's championship ambitions unravelled in spectacular fashion in the subsequent provincial campaign, when a 2‚Äì20 to 1‚Äì6 trouncing by Wexford dumped Larkin's team out of the championship. In spite of this Larkin was later presented with a third All-Star. Larkin was now very much in the twilight of his career as Kilkenny's fortunes took an upward turn in 1978. A 2‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì16 defeat of three-in-a-row hopefuls Wexford gave Larkin an eighth Leinster medal. On 3 September 1978 Kilkenny faced reigning champions Cork in the All-Ireland decider. Cork secured a first three-in-a-row of All-Ireland titles for the first time in over twenty years, as a Jimmy Barry-Murphy goal helped the team to a 1‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì8 victory. Larkin later collected a fourth All- Star award. In 1979 Larkin won his ninth Leinster medal as Kilkenny defeated Wexford by 2‚Äì21 to 2‚Äì17. \\"The Cats\\" later faced surprise finalists Galway in the All-Ireland decider on 2 September 1979. In one of the worst All-Ireland finals of the decade, Tipperary-born Galway goalkeeper S√©amus Shinnors had an absolute nightmare of a game. A 70-yards free by Liam \\"Chunky\\" O'Brien after just four minutes dipped, hit off Shinnors and ended up in the Galway net. Galway fought back and went two points up twelve minutes into the second half, however, they failed to score for the rest of the game. Four minutes before the end of the game another long-range free for Kilkenny ended up in the net behind Shinnors. It was a score which summed up the day for Galway as Kilkenny went on to win by 2‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì8. Larkin, the oldest man on the field of play, collected his fifth and final All-Ireland medal. Larkin remained on the Kilkenny panel early in 1980, but retired from inter-county duty before the start of the championship. =Inter-provincial= Larkin also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial series of games, and enjoyed much success during a lengthy career. He was at right corner-back in 1972 as Leinster defeated Munster by 3‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì10 to take the Railway Cup. Leinster dominated the championship during this era and, after missing the 1973 campaign, Larkin was back on the team in 1974. A 2‚Äì15 to 1‚Äì13 defeat of Munster gave him a second Railway Cup medal. Munster fell by 2‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì11 in 1975, with Larkin collecting a third Railway Cup medal. Six-in-a-row proved beyond Leinster, however, the team bounced back in 1977. A 2‚Äì17 to 1‚Äì13 defeat of archrivals Munster gave Larkin a fourth Railway Cup medal. In 1979 Larkin, by now a veteran, was appointed captain of the team. A 1‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì9 defeat of Connacht gave him a fifth and final winner' medal, while he also had the honour of lifting the Railway Cup. Recognition In 1973 Larkin was recognised as one of the best corner-backs of his era. The citation on his first All-Star that year read: \\"For his dependability in defence, which combines with his natural hurling skill to establish him as one of the great corner backs of today.\\" Eddie Keher, a contemporary of Larkin's, said of him: \\"Inch for inch and pound for pound, he was the best corner back I have ever seen or encountered.\\". In 2000 Larkin received the ultimate honour when he was chosen at right corner- back on the Kilkenny Hurling Team of the Century. Personal life Larkin was born in \\"the village\\" area of Kilkenny. His father, Paddy Larkin, was a member of the defence forces and was a four-time All-Ireland medallist with Kilkenny between 1932 and 1939. Larkin's uncle, Mick, won an All-Ireland medal as a non-playing substitute during the same era. From an early age Larkin was known as \\"Fan\\", a nickname which was adopted to avoid confusion with his cousin who was also called Philip Larkin.

It is a contour collector road that is parallel to a buried creek to the north called Castle Frank Brook. Vaughan Road begins on Bathurst Street south of St. Clair Avenue West, then it becomes a north-south street, hence its address numbering system, then it becomes a northwest-southeast street. Finally, Vaughan Road ends in a dead- end near the intersection of Eglinton Avenue and Dufferin Street. Vaughan Road Academy is named after this road. History Vaughan Road is indirectly named after Benjamin Vaughan Vaughan Road was built as early as 1850. Before then, it was a trail used by the First Nations. Its original alignment began at Yonge Street, followed Davenport Road to Bathurst Street, then along the current alignment of Vaughan Road into Dufferin Street; in fact, there is still a curve in Dufferin Street at the intersection with Eglinton Avenue, where Vaughan Road connected. By the 1960s, Vaughan Road was closed before it could connect with Eglinton; an Esso gas station and parkette later occupied the former right of way and intersection, but demolished in the mid-2010s to accommodate Fairbank station of Line 5 Eglinton, scheduled to open in 2021. Vaughan Road was then extended north along what is now Dufferin Street into Vaughan Township, which later became the City of Vaughan. Therefore, Vaughan Road is named after the township, which itself is named after Benjamin Vaughan, a British commissioner who signed a peace treaty with the United States in 1783. This road was popular with street racers in the 1950s due to its many curves from being parallel to a creek. Since 2000, Vaughan Road had undergone the early stages of gentrification, especially at the corner of Oakwood and Vaughan, as well as the former City of Toronto stretch of Vaughan Road. Public transit The road passes through the communities of Humewood‚ÄìCedarvale and Oakwood‚ÄìVaughan. The Toronto Transit Commission bus route 90 Vaughan serves these communities. The terminus of the 90A branch is the Jesmond loop, which uses the streets Jesmond-Oakwood-Vaughan, thus named for one of the streets. The terminus of the main branch is the Eglinton loop, which is active during rush hour only. Both branches of the route feed into St. Clair West station. There is also a stop at Vaughan Road on the 512 St. Clair streetcar route. The Old City of Toronto segment of the road features an active southbound streetcar track; this formed part of the loop used by Bathurst streetcars to return south, until the route was truncated to Bathurst Station. The track still serves an important role, being the only route by which St. Clair streetcars can leave St. Clair Avenue to connect to the rest of the system for storage and maintenance; although unmarked on transit maps, passengers are generally permitted on streetcars headed south along Bathurst Street via this connector.

Wrexham owes a large amount of its original industrial heritage to Bersham, but despite this the village still retains a rural feeling.  Historical significance  The village holds special importance for economic historians, for not only did it house the workshops of the skilled Davies brothers, it was one of the cradles of the Industrial Revolution. This is the place where British iron making began in 1670, where smelting iron ore with coke began in 1721, and where John Wilkinson, the 'Iron Mad' pioneer of the Industrial Revolution, set up shop in 1761. For many years the area was one of the most important iron manufacturing centres in the world. The Bersham Ironworks Museum tells the story of the man who bored cannon for the American War of Independence and cylinders for James Watt's revolutionary steam engine that changed the face of the world. Bersham Colliery, the last working coal mine in the former Denbighshire Coalfield, was not actually in the village of Bersham but situated nearby in the village of Rhostyllen, it closed in 1986. The collapse of a shaft from the colliery in the 1970s seriously affected the structural security of the nearby Erddig House allowing compensation of ¬£120,000 to be claimed by the National Trust against the National Coal Board.  Plas Power Woods  Plas Power Woods comprise 33.7ha of woodland running along the River Clywedog between Coedpoeth and Bersham, and stretches to the Nant Mill Wood situated upstream to the east on the Clywedog Trail. The vast majority of the woodland is ancient woodland although some parts were replanted with conifers and, locally, with beech and/or sycamore as late as the 1960s. The Woodland Trust is gradually restoring the native broadleaf woodland character of the plantation areas. Several features of historical importance are present; a section of Offa's Dyke runs across the Clywedog Valley through Plas Power Woods. Several Listed structures are also present including Plas Power Park wall, an ornate cast iron Victorian era bridge and railings and the Western Weir, Nant Bridge, Bersham Lodge and Caeau Wier.  Bersham Church and the FitzHugh family  Bersham Church Bersham Church St Mary's in Plas Power is a 19th-century parish church in the heart of the village. The church was founded and built by Thomas Lloyd FitzHugh in 1875. His wife Emily Mary from Charlecote in Warwickshire took a great interest in the building and is the reason why the architect and organ builder were both from that county. It was originally built without a bell tower; however, one was added some years later. When Captain Godfrey FitzHugh was killed on active service in Palestine in 1917 his widow Ethel had the bells installed in his memory. They consist of a carillon of eight bells operated by hand and are still in use today.

The painting gained its current name in the early 19th century, when an Amsterdam art collector identified the subject as that of a Jewish father bestowing a necklace upon his daughter on her wedding day. This interpretation is no longer accepted, and the identity of the couple is uncertain. The ambiguity is heightened by the lack of anecdotal context, leaving only the central universal theme, that of a couple joined in love.Bull, Duncan, et al., Rembrandt-Caravaggio, p.131. Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, 2006. Speculative suggestions as to the couple's identity have ranged from Rembrandt's son Titus and his bride, or Amsterdam poet Miguel de Barrios and his wife. Also considered are several couples from the Old Testament, including Abraham and Sarah, Boaz and Ruth, or Isaac and Rebekah, which is supported by a drawing by the artist several years prior.Bull, p. 131. While technical evidence suggests that Rembrandt initially envisioned a larger and more elaborate composition, the placement of his signature at lower left indicates that its current dimensions are not significantly different from those at the time of its completion.Bull, p. 132.

In his Major League career, he played for the New York Yankees and St. Louis Browns. Because of his speed on the basepaths, he was known as \\"Catonsville Flash\\" or just \\"Flash\\" by his fans. In 1914, he led the American League with 74 stolen bases, and was only caught stealing 17 times that year, an 81 percent success rate. Maisel was born in Catonsville, Maryland. In 1910, he was signed by Jack Dunn of the Baltimore Orioles, and started with an Orioles farm team (probably the Elgin Kittens) in Elgin, Illinois. (The Orioles were a minor league team during the period of 1903 through 1953.) After his major league career, he rejoined the Baltimore Orioles as team captain in 1919, and led the team to seven straight International League pennants. In 1929, after the death of Jack Dunn, Fritz became the manager of the Orioles and managed them from the 1929 through 1932 seasons. He was inducted into the International League Hall of Fame in 1959. Maisel was not regarded by some as a very successful manager for the Orioles of the International League, despite his winning record. He did not have much talent on the team and became a laughing stock of the Baltimore press. He was blamed for all the misfortunes of the team. Maisel was Chief of the Baltimore County Fire Department from 1938 to 1951. At the time of his death, he was a scout for the Baltimore Orioles (the Orioles have been a Major League Baseball team since 1954). He was a lifelong resident of Catonsville.

The southern terminus of the route was at an intersection with U.S. Route 20A (US 20A) in the hamlet of Wales Center within the town of Wales. Its northern terminus was at a junction with US 20 in the town of Alden. NY 358 mostly followed Two Rod Road; however, it was also routed on parts of Liberia and Four Rod roads. NY 358 initially extended only from NY 354 to US 20 when it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It was extended southward to Wales Center by 1935 over what had been originally part of NY 354\\\\. The NY 358 designation was removed in April 1982 and replaced with four different routes, including New York State Route 954G, an unsigned reference route. Route description NY 358 began at US 20A (Big Tree Road) in Wales Center, a hamlet in the northern part of the town of Wales. The route headed north on Four Rod Road, briefly paralleling Buffalo Creek before turning north to exit the valley surrounding the creek. Upon emerging from the valley and entering the town of Marilla, NY 358 turned west onto Liberia Road and followed it to the creekside community of Porterville. In Porterville, the route met Two Rod Road. It turned north, following Two Rod Road out of Porterville. North of Porterville, NY 358 intersected Jamison Road (County Route 574 or CR 574), once designated as NY 422. The route continued on through rural portions of Marilla to the hamlet of the same name, where it served as the primary north‚Äìsouth street in the community. Just north of Marilla, NY 358 intersected NY 354 (Clinton Street). The route continued onward into the town of Alden, where the amount of development along the highway began to increase. It crossed over Cayuga Creek, then ended shortly afterward at an intersection with US 20 (Broadway). History In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route 19, an unsigned legislative route extending from Buffalo to Batavia via Marilla and Wales Center. Route 19 entered Marilla on what is now Clinton Street and followed Two Rod, Liberia, and Four Rod Roads south to Wales Center, where it turned east onto Big Tree Road (now US 20A). The portion of legislative Route 19 northwest of Wales Center was not assigned a posted route designation until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it became part of NY 354\\\\. Also assigned at this time was NY 358, which was initially a short north‚Äìsouth connector between NY 354 in Marilla and NY 35 (now US 20) in Alden. NY 354 was rerouted to continue east on Clinton Street to NY 239 while NY 358 was extended southward to Wales Center over the former alignment of NY 354. NY 358 reference marker that remains on Two Rod Road in Alden Two sections of NY 358 were transferred from the state of New York to Erie County in the 1980s as part of two separate highway maintenance swaps between the two levels of government. On April 1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of the Liberia Road and Four Rod Road portions of NY 358 was transferred to the county as part of a larger swap. One of the highways transferred from Erie County to the state as part of the exchange was the portion of Two Rod Road south of Liberia Road. Under the terms of another swap, the segment of NY 358 north of NY 354 would be transferred to the county upon the completion of the Southern Expressway between Springville and Buffalo. The last section of the freeway, from Hamburg to Springville, was completed in the early 1980s. Even though all three roads were now county-maintained, NY 358 continued to extend north on Two Rod Road to US 20 and south on Liberia and Four Rod Roads to Wales Center. NY 358 continued to exist until April 1982, when the designation was split into four other routes. The state-maintained portion of NY 358 on Two Rod Road became part of NY 954G, an unsigned reference route that continued south on the segment of Two Road Road transferred to the state in 1980 to meet US 20A west of Wales Center. Meanwhile, the county-maintained portions of the route on Two Rod, Liberia and Four Rod Roads retained their concurrent county route designations, namely CR 547, CR 402, and CR 356, respectively.

Dillinger's six years in the major leagues showcased his batting ability (he led the American League in hits in 1948 with 207 and batted over .300 four times) and his speed (he was the Junior Circuit's stolen base champion for three consecutive years, through , with 82 total thefts), but poor defense and a perceived lackadaisical attitude resulted in a premature end to his big-league tenure. He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Early life Born in Glendale, California, and nicknamed \\"Duke\\", Dillinger attended the University of Idaho in Moscow and played football for the Vandals, but broke his collarbone as a freshman in 1936 and was injured again as a sophomore; he left the school in the spring of 1938. He was signed by the Browns as an amateur free agent in 1939. He hit over .300 in three of his four minor-league seasons before his playing career was interrupted by World War II service in the United States Army Air Forces from 1943 through 1945.Baseball in Wartime Baseball career In 1946, the first postwar season, Dillinger made the Browns' MLB roster as the backup to veteran third baseman Mark Christman, starting 50 games at the hot corner and batting .307. Just prior to the 1947 campaign, the Browns made room for Dillinger by selling Christman's contract to the Washington Senators. In his first season as a regular, Dillinger led his team in hits (168) and his league in stolen bases (34). Then, in 1948, he batted .321, his AL-best 207 hits including 34 doubles and ten triples, along with 28 stolen bases, repeating as the American League's base-stealing king. Then, the following year, Dillinger batted a career-best .324, stole 20 more bags (again the league's best), and was selected to the 1949 All-Star team. In the midsummer classic, played at Ebbets Field on July 12, Dillinger entered the contest in the sixth inning as a pinch runner for George Kell. He displayed his speed by scoring from first base on a double by Joe DiMaggio to help the AL increase its lead to 8‚Äì5. Staying in the game at third base, he came to bat in the seventh inning and singled off Howie Pollet, driving in Dom DiMaggio, and then scored a run himself when he again tallied from first base on a double, this time hit by Dale Mitchell.Retrosheet box score: 1949 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. The American League went on to win, 11‚Äì7, with Dillinger scoring two runs and collecting a key run batted in. That off-season, however, Dillinger was traded away from the Browns, as he and Paul Lehner were swapped to the Philadelphia Athletics for four players and $100,000. The Athletics had finished eight games over .500 in 1949, the team's third straight winning season. Philadelphia had briefly contended for the American League pennant in 1948. The season would mark Connie Mack's 50th year as the team's manager, and the Athletics acquired top-calibre talent like Dillinger to try to put Mack over the top.Spink, J.G. Taylor; Rickart, Paul A.; Lanigan, Ernest J.; Kachline, Clifford: \\"Review of 1950 Season,\\" Baseball Guide & Record Book 1951. The Sporting News, pp. 95-96 But 1950 was a disaster for the Athletics. Instead of contending for first place, they fell into the league's cellar, and were only 29‚Äì57 on July 20, 1950. That day, despite his .309 batting average in 84 games, they got waivers on Dillinger and sold his contract to the National League's last-place team, the Pittsburgh Pirates. Dillinger batted .288 in 58 games for the Bucs, to finish the campaign at .301. He split 1951 between Pittsburgh and the Chicago White Sox, and matched that .301 average in 101 games played. It was his last year in the majors. He played his last four professional seasons (1952-55) in the Pacific Coast League, where he moved to the outfield and led the league in hitting with a .366 mark in 1953. As an excellent contact hitter, his career MLB batting average was .306. He amassed 888 hits, with 123 doubles, 47 triples and ten home runs in 3,201 plate appearances. He stole 106 bases, and was caught stealing 50 times.Baseball Reference In the field, he experienced problems throwing the ball to first base, and was criticized regularly for lack of effort in fielding ground balls‚Äîa charge that Dillinger strongly contested.Corbett, Warren, Bob Dillinger.

Service history During World War II, LST-511 was assigned to the European Theater and participated in the invasion of Normandy in June, 1944. Designated as a hospital ship for the invasion with two doctors and a contingent of corpsmen, she completed 50 round trips from English ports to the Normandy beaches. LST-511 was also one of the eight LSTs participating in \\"Exercise Tiger\\", a practice for D-Day on 28 April, during which German E-boats attacked, hitting three of the eight LSTs. Two sank immediately and the third was towed to port by its own LCVPs. Upon her return to the United States, she was decommissioned on 19 December 1945 and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 8 January 1946. On 17 February 1948 the ship was sold to the Anglo-Canadian Pulp & Paper Mills of Quebec, Canada for operation and renamed Robert McMichael. She was then subsequently purchased by Agence Maritime and the renamed the Fort Gaspe. In service into the 1970s, her final fate is unknown. LST-511 received one battle star for World War II service.

The Ashcroft Manor is located on the Trans-Canada Hwy #1, at the junction for southern cutoff from the highway to the town of Ashcroft below on the Thompson River. In the heyday of the Cornwall brothers, Ashcroft Manor was one of the centres of British-style country life in the British Columbia Interior, and was famous for its fox-hunting parties and line of hounds, as well as race horses, and drew the early province's high society to these and other entertainments. Overlooking Ashcroft Manor to the north is the Cache Creek Waste Disposal Facility near the town of the same name.

The UFTR is a light water and graphite moderated, graphite reflected, light water cooled reactor designed and used primarily for training and nuclear research related activities. The UFTR is licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and is the only research reactor in Florida. The UFTR resumed operations in April, 2015 after a multi-year facility refurbishment to upgrade the physical infrastructure, including new low enrichment uranium (LEU) fuel, replacement of the HVAC systems, upgraded security systems, and various instrumentation and control (I&C;) system upgrades. The reactor's power level is regulated by cadmium blades that act as mechanical shim (analogous to control rods in a pressurized water reactor). Nominal maximum thermal flux density for the UFTR is 1.8E12 neutrons/cm2¬∑s. The UFTR is integral to the Nuclear Engineering Program (NEP) at the University of Florida and it offers the ability for students to learn the fundamentals of nuclear operation, neutron detection, and reactor physics. The UFTR also offers unique training opportunities for students enrolled at other educational institutions as well as future reactor operators or technical experts at commercial nuclear plants since it enables the ability to perform and analyze reactor manipulations not often performed at commercial facilities.

The chain is about 40 km (25 mi) long, and the identified volcanic features include 48 cinder cones, eight lava domes, and 15 maars and explosion craters. Its highest point is the lava dome of Puy de D√¥me, located near the middle of the chain, which is high. The name of the range comes from a French term, puy, that refers to a volcanic mountain with a rounded profile. A date of 4040 BCE is usually given for the last eruption of a Cha√Æne des Puys volcano. The location became a World Heritage site in 2018.  Formation  The chain began to form approximately 95,000 years ago, and the volcanic activity that formed the range stopped about 10,000 years ago. The majority of the cones were formed by Strombolian eruptions, and these cones usually have well-defined summit craters. Some have nested craters, and others show broken rims where lava poured through. In contrast, Puy de D√¥me was created by a Pel√©an eruption; this type of eruption is characterized by long dormant periods periodically interrupted by sudden, extremely violent eruptions.  Research  The chain was the subject of the pioneering research of English geologist George Julius Poulett Scrope, starting in the 1820s. In 1827 he published his Memoir on the Geology of Central France, including the Volcanic formations of Auvergne, the Velay and the Vivarais, which was later re-published in a revised and somewhat more popular form in The Geology and extinct Volcanos of Central France in 1858. These books were the first widely published descriptions of the Cha√Æne des Puys, and the analysis therein laid the foundation for many of the basic principles of volcanology.

He was raised in Paradise Prairie, twenty miles outside of Spokane, Washington. He stole thirteen cars when he was thirteen. In 1968 Smith was one of thirteen middies ousted by the Naval Academy for smoking pot.Barnes, Bart. \\"13 Middies Ousted In Marijuana Case,\\" The Washington Post (Feb. 21, 1968). He haggled a deal with the government upon discharge; they agreed to pay for his education. He went on to receive a bachelor's degree in English and philosophy with a 3.8 GPA from Loyola College in Maryland.Cullinan, Helen. \\"Angry Young Artist Has Mellowed With Age,\\" The Plain Dealer (Sept. 30, 1993). Smith married into an East Coast blue-blood family in 1969. In 1970, he was arrested for armed robbery. Smith lived in Baltimore and other cities before coming to Cleveland in 1977 in pursuit of another man's wife. She then divorced her husband and decided to marry someone other than Smith.Putre, Laura. \\"Blurb,\\" The Scene (Apr. 26, 1996). Art Smith's art assemblages started when one day, instead of painting a key on a canvas, he picked it up and pasted it onto the canvas.Heaton, Michael. \\"Nothing can save your life like a really good art attack,\\" The Plain Dealer (Apr. 18, 2003). Smith's art uses iconic baubles with the effect of cheapening and attacking cultural themes. The work has been characterized as \\"difficult and uncompromising,\\"Sparks, Amy Bracken. \\"A Place to Call Home,\\" Cleveland Edition (Sept. 8, 1988). and \\"repellent and grotesque,\\" with roots from the dadaist collages of Schwitters and Rauschenberg. Materials used include rusted wire, shattered glass, obscene imagery, dead mice, the artificial leg of a dead drug dealer and sometimes other people's art. His work is washed in blue \\"corrosion,\\" a mix of matte medium, copper powder, and salt.Green, Frank. \\"Alchemy In Reverse,\\" The Cleveland Free Times (Apr. 20, 1994). Another reviewer says Smith's use of oxidized copper makes his works appear to be fetched from the bottom of the sea. Smith uses cultural themes as found objects. \\"I deal in symbolic juxtapositions of the odd and unwanted,\\" Smith says. \\"My materials consist of cultural castoffs, sociological implications and the refuse known as suburban thought. My goals are simple; erase your labels; learn to look about ... Learn to see dead frog and rust and thus re- see yourself.\\" He says, \\"My art is a collaboration with the pieces.\\" After the death of his brother Cat (Vincent Smith), Smith started exhibiting his brother's remains at his shows, leaving some of the ashes behind after each exhibit. Notoriety Smith first gained notoriety with a piece ‚Äî American Ego ‚Äî in the People's Art Show at CSU. His piece was a four-by-three grid of Polaroid snapshots, nude photos of himself in compromising positions with the American flag.Neff, James. \\"Must Be Profound,\\" The Plain Dealer (Dec. 3, 1984) This piece won the \\"most outrageous\\" award at the show. Next, three pieces of his art were censored from a show at Tri-C West. Smith agreed to the removal as long as a \\"censored\\" notice was put on the wall in place of the missing art. The opening night poetry reading was reassigned to a remote conference room. During the reading Smith discovered that Tri-C neglected to post the notes. He wrote \\"CENSORED\\" on the wall with a ball point pen. Poet Daniel Thompson decided to read in the original gallery, and mouthed the words to his poem silently as a Tri-C co-director sanded the words off the wall.Cullinan, Helen. \\"Censorship Charges Mar Tri-C West Show\\" Cleveland Plain Dealer (May 1, 1986). Work Smith worked longest as a computer programmer, which helped support ArtCrimes and his art. He frequently contracted with BP. Previous occupations include sailor, milk man, life insurance salesman, avant garde theater manager, newspaper film and music critic, woman's shoe salesmen, prison cook, carnival laborer, and church janitor. He's also worked at Bethlehem Steel. Smith's \\"resume\\" was published in an article from 2000: *1950s ** farm boy ** cow milker ** chicken/rabbit/hog waste remover ** hod carrier * 1960s ** paper boy ** car thief ** electronics technician ** poet ** USNA midshipman ** artist ** husband * 1970s ** chemist ** prison cook ** bankrupt ** avant-garde theatre manager ** newspaper film/music critic ** women's shoe salesman ** adulterer ** divorced Cleveland Warehouse District Smith and his friend and frequent collaborator S. Judson Wilcox were two early \\"urban pioneers\\": artists who settled the Warehouse District in Cleveland in 1981.Morton, Elizabeth. \\"Art Behind Bars,\\" Dialogue Magazine (July 1987). Artists, musicians and renegades moved there to revel in Cleveland's industrial beauty. The warehouse district was a haven. Smith and Wilcox had an \\"Art Behind Bars\\" installation in the district with mannequins, Mickey Mouse, and neon tube calliope. Smith's brother \\"Cat\\" moved into the warehouse with him. Cat Smith's collages were dead ringers for Schwitters'. Smith and Cat's spot in the warehouse became a gathering spot for other artists in the building, and scene, including S. Judson Wilcox, Melissa Jay Craig (AKA \\"Field Marshal May Midwest\\"), Jeff Chiplis, Laszlo Gyorki, Ken Nevadomi, Randy Rigutto, Jay Clements, and Beth Wolfe. Guests were offered keepsakes of miniature toy soldiers, babies in plastic bubbles, or poetry.Sparks, Amy Bracken. \\"Howling at the Edge of a Renaissance: SPACES and Alternative Art in Cleveland, 1978-1998,\\" Performance Art Festival catalogue (Sept. 1998). SPACES Gallery was located on the first floor, making the warehouse the de facto epicenter of creative activity. Cat was a troubled man who eventually committed suicide. After he died, Smith heard a beeping in his studio. He couldn't figure out where the beeping came from, and thought it was the soul of his dead brother. He then found a worn-out smoke detector at the bottom of a huge pile in his studio. In another installation with Wilcox, Smith used a bag of his dead brother's ashes. He claimed to have a pact with Cat. The first to die would be included in an exhibition of the other's work.Cullinan, Helen. \\"Ashes to Ashes, Poet to Artist,\\" The Cleveland Plain Dealer (July 1988). In one of the exhibitions at SPACES gallery, Smith put Cat's ashes on a pedestal. The bag was punctured by a friend and ashes spilled onto the pedestal and the floor. ArtCrimes Before making visual art, Smith crafted unique journals into which he'd juxtapose images and poetry and journal entries.Sparks, Amy Bracken. \\"Surreal Thing: Eccentric Artist and Collector Steve Smith Bares All,\\" Free Times (Mar. 15-21, 2000). Smith wrote clever, punning poetry and read it all over town. (His poetry is described as \\"a stream-of-consciousness assault on reason and order\\" and \\"a cross between Dada and Jack Kerouac.\\") Smith used his art and poetry to make political statements, and he also participated in a couple legendary \\"regional art terrorist\\" raids in the Flats. Starting in 1986, Smith published the Cleveland cult underground publication ArtCrimes, a zine full of images and poems which also shared his disrespect for authority. ArtCrimes took on the spirit of Smith's journals, like a sketchbook that's been passed around to dozens of different artists.Tranberg, Dan. \\"Art Matters: Underground publication carries on as a quiet force,\\" The Plain Dealer (August 2, 2002).Bly, Lyz. \\"Capturing the Smiths: Mother Dwarf's collages evoke an often painful family history,\\" Cleveland Free Times (May 11, 2005). The zine was influenced by the beats,Utter, Douglas Max. \\"Criminals At Large: Steven B. Smith's Farewell ArtCrimes Is His Best Ever,\\" Cleveland Free Times (August 9, 2006). and was consistent with the style of publications from the days of Kerouac, Corso, and Ginsberg. Contributors included everyone from Bukowski and Micheline to people's pets. Ohio poets and artists included the likes of Daniel Thompson, Maj Ragain, Amy Bracken Sparks, Ben Gulyas, Chris Franke, Harvey Pekar, Gary Dumm, Masumi Hayashi and Ken Nevadomi.Budimir, Milenko. \\"Crimes-free Cleveland: The city‚Äôs agent of chaos takes on a new mission,\\" Northern Ohio Live (June 2006). One reviewer postulated that ArtCrimes was the most significant publication of the Cleveland underground art scene in recent history. Tremont The affordability of Cleveland neighborhoods periodically caused mass migrations of artists. In the 1980s, Smith was one of the urban pioneers to move into the Warehouse District. In '85, he was one of many artists who moved from the warehouses to Tremont, in the typical pattern where artists move into undesirable but inexpensive neighborhoods, fixing up old buildings in which to live and work. Shortly after Smith's move to Tremont, Cat committed suicide. Pappy Smith died shortly after, and Mother Dwarf (Florence E. Smith) left Las Vegas to come to live with Smith.Sparks, Amy Bracken. \\"A Most Common Name, A Most Unusual Family,\\" The Cleveland Free Times (Aug. 11, 1993). Mother Dwarf began her art career producing collages for ArtCrimes. Smith and his mother's life together became a mother-son artistic collaboration. Smith nearly died in 1991 from alcohol, and has been sober since then. One notable drunken episode was after an art auction. He'd bid loudly on every piece offered. He took a walk home with Mother Dwarf. He passed a fence of barking dogs, and started to howl \\"in communion.\\" He leaned up over the dogs and they bit his scalp. The next day, Smith asked Mother Dwarf why he was covered in blood. \\"You mean...\\" she said, \\"You don't remember the dogs?\\" Recent In an interview in 2000, Smith claimed his voice was raspy \\"because I don't talk to anyone anymore.\\" He'd become a recluse whose doormat said \\"Go Away.\\" He said, \\"I had to learn silence. People only remember the old days when I shocked people with what I said or made or did. But there's a lot of beauty in the things I've done.\\" In 2005 Smith's life hit a series of highs and lows. His mother died, he fell in love, he retired, and then discovered he had throat cancer. He published the final issue of ArtCrimes in 2006.Tranberg, Dan. \\"Art Matters With Dan Tranberg: Emigrating artist Steven Smith holds 'liquidation sale' exhibit,\\" The Plain Dealer (May 5, 2006). Smith is a documentarian. His journals are not the only documentation of his life. He continues with his 2500-page website agentofchaos.com. Smith married poet Lady K in 2006. They began their relationship shortly after the death of Mother Dwarf in 2005. In 2006 Smith and his wife sold their home, gave away all of their possessions, and moved to Europe. His most recent book, Where Never Was Already Is (published in 2018), includes several decades of his poetry as well as many black and white examples of his collage art.

It has been designated as a grade II* listed building. History Until the early 19th century Kingswood had no church of its own, and was served by the ancient parish of Bitton four miles away. A church was considered an urgent requirement by Anglicans, as the area was a hot-bed of Nonconformity with the Wesleyan, Whitfield Tabernacle and Moravian churches already in operation. The church was built within sight of all three and was given a tower so that it became more prominent than its neighbours. It was one of the first churches built from funds voted by Parliament to mark Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, and hence known as a \\"Waterloo Church\\". The foundation stone was laid by the Bishop of Gloucester on 9 June 1819, but there followed a dispute over the title of the site which meant that building did not begin in earnest until 1820. The completed church was consecrated on 11 September 1821. The architect was James Foster. The church was damaged by fire in 1852 and the panelled ceiling in the nave was never replaced. The present chancel was added 1897-1900. It contains a Sweetland Organ built in 1903. There are two bells in the tower however these are no longer ringable. The churchyard contains war graves of eight service personnel of World War I and seven of World War II. CWGC Cemetery Report. Breakdown obtained from casualty record.

The Song of Deborah speaks of officers (mechokekim) coming from Machir to join the battle against Sisera. Analysis The passage appears to reflect an early time in the history of Israel, before Israel was organized as a nation, when it was instead a group of loosely associated tribes. In the later standardized lists of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, Machir does not appear, but rather the Tribe of Manasseh appears in its place. Machir \\"may have been an independent clan that was eventually absorbed within Manasseh.\\" Other hypotheses include the idea that Manasseh was originally a clan within Machir which became more prominent than the rest of the tribe, or that Manasseh may have been another group who displaced the Machirites. According to traditions in the Pentateuch, which view the tribes as descending from the sons of Jacob, Machir was the son of Manasseh, but was legally adopted by Jacob. This places the origins of the \\"Machirite group\\" in Egypt. After the time in Egypt, the Bible records that Moses gave the region of Gilead to Machir as part of the eastern half of the inheritance of Manasseh ().

Early life Claire was born on October 5, 1935 in Jamestown, Ohio. His father owned and operated a drugstore. Claire has one brother and a sister. In 1950, Marston and Mary Francis Claire moved their family to Torrance, CA, a suburb of Los Angeles. Fred graduated from Torrance High School, then obtained his bachelor's degree in journalism from San Jose State University. He holds an Associate of Arts degree from Mt. San Antonio College and has been honored by the college as an outstanding alumnus. He also attended El Camino College, located in Torrance. While at El Camino, he had a paper published in Baseball Magazine called \\"Make Way for the Coast League\\" which discussed baseball on the west coast and turning the Pacific Coast League into a Major League. Throughout the late 1950s and 1960s, Claire worked as a sports editor/sports writer for the Whittier Daily News, the Pomona Progress-Bulletin, and the Long Beach Independent Press-Telegram. He married and had three children, Jen, Jeff, and Kim. Dodgers Public Relations executive In the spring of 1969, Fred was assigned to cover the Dodgers during spring training in Vero Beach, FL for the Press-Telegram. During the season, one of the assistants in the public relations department for the Dodgers was fired. Claire expressed his interest in the position to Dodger executives and was hired in July 1969. He worked in that same position until 1975 when his boss, Dodgers vice president of public relations, Red Patterson, left to work for the California Angels. Claire moved into Patterson's position. During his time as VP of Public Relations, he was instrumental in creating the branding that came to be known as \\"Dodger blue\\" and the subsequent \\"Think Blue\\" campaign and also the hiring of announcer Ross Porter. Porter would remain a Dodger announcer from 1977 until 2004. Dodgers General Manager On April 6, 1987, Dodgers General Manager Al Campanis accepted the offer to appear on the Nightline television show to talk about his thoughts on the 40th anniversary of Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier. Campanis did not alert anyone in the Dodgers organization that he would be on the show. When Campanis was asked why he felt there were not African American baseball managers, he stated, \\"I truly believe they may not have some of the necessities to be, let's say, a field manager, or perhaps, a general manager. Why are black people not good swimmers? Because they don't have buoyancy.\\" These comments stunned the baseball world. Campanis, who did not have a reputation as a racist and was one of the few Dodger players to welcome Robinson during his debut, was forced to resign his post with the Dodgers with Claire assuming player personnel responsibilities. Dodgers president Peter O'Malley moved Claire into the general manager position. After a dismal 1987 season, Claire rebuilt the team into an instant playoff contender. During the offseason before the 1988 season, Claire acquired veteran outfielders Kirk Gibson and Mike Davis, veteran shortstop Alfredo Griffin, and pitchers Jay Howell and Jesse Orosco. The Dodgers would go on to win the 1988 World Series against the heavily favored Oakland Athletics in just five games. His later moves were not as successful. On November 8, 1990 the Dodgers gave free agent outfielder Darryl Strawberry a five-year contract worth $20 million. At the time it looked like a good deal. Strawberry hit 37 home runs with a .277 batting average in 1989 for the New York Mets. However, Strawberry's time with the Dodgers was characterized by chronic back problems, drug abuse and overall underachievement. Strawberry was given his outright release on May 26, 1994 after he failed to show up to a game. The following year, on November 27, 1991, Claire traded pitchers Tim Belcher and John Wetteland to the Cincinnati Reds for outfielder Eric Davis and pitcher Kip Gross. It was supposed to set up a reunion of childhood friends Strawberry and Davis. However, Davis was also plagued by injuries throughout his less than 2-year stint with the Dodgers. He was traded to the Detroit Tigers in August 1993. Wetteland, was traded from the Reds to the Montreal Expos less than a month after he had joined the Reds. Wetteland went on to become one of the most dominating relief pitchers in the MLB throughout the rest of the 1990s. The transaction even Claire would later regret occurred in 1994. In need of a second baseman after a contract dispute with Jody Reed, Claire sent the talented Pedro Mart√≠nez to Montreal for Delino DeShields. Martinez became one of the best pitchers in the MLB for the next decade and a half. Martinez was selected to 8 All Star teams and won the Cy Young Award in 1997, 1999 and 2000 and, eventually, was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Deshields spent three years as the Dodgers starting second baseman in which he was more known for his various injuries and numerous complaints that the Dodgers did not have enough black players on the team. FOX takeover/Claire's removal Claire continued as the Dodger general manager through the 1997 season. When Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, owner of the Fox network and 20th Century Fox purchased the team in 1998, officials stated that Claire and Field Manager Bill Russell would remain in their positions. On May 15, 1998, new Dodger officials made a blockbuster trade without the involvement or knowledge of General Manager Claire, a move that was unheard of in baseball at the time. The trade was one of the biggest in Dodger history. The Dodgers traded Mike Piazza and Todd Zeile to the Florida Marlins for Gary Sheffield, Charles Johnson, Jim Eisenreich and Bobby Bonilla. Claire was furious that the new FOX officials would make such a deal as Piazza had been with the organization for over a decade and Zeile had signed for less than market value to be closer to his home in suburban Santa Clarita, CA. Claire, who had full control of player transactions before FOX took over, pulled no punches when he was asked his feeling on the trade. On June 21, 1998 Claire and Russell were both relieved of their duties in what was deemed by those in baseball as the \\"Sunday Night Massacre.\\" Russell was replaced by Glenn Hoffman, Claire by Tom Lasorda.

Nohara family=Shin-chan Nohara= ; (ÈáéÂéüÊñ∞‰πãÂä©) :Age: 5 (First appearance) - 6 (Currently ) : :He is the main character, son of Hiroshi and Misae. His nickname is \\"Shinchan\\" Nohara and he is Himawari's brother, a kindergarten-aged boy whose antics are the basis for the series. He is often involved in a running gag of pulling down his pants to reveal his buttocks and dance in the process with an accompanying original song (known as \\"Ass dance\\" in the Funimation English dub). His affectionate name by relatives is Shin-chan. He is five years old and loves chocolate biscuits of the brand \\"Chocobi\\" and a TV superhero named \\"Action Mask\\", but he absolutely hates green peppers (acute lachanophobia). He always take care of his sister, Himawari. He inherited more genes from his mother than his father. He is lethargic, loves to eat and sleep, imagining things, cannot resist good things, opinionated and brazen which is just like his mother while the only thing same with his father is likes to watch and flirt pretty young ladies. He is a very good singer and pretty good baseball and football player. He learned photography from his aunt Musae. Sometimes he changes the actual words, making it very funny. For example, promise becomes promotion etc. He often exhibits deep affection for his friend Kazama. Some of his strange activities include dressing up (often as an animal). He also causes trouble for others and then criticizes their efforts in covering for him. In general, he is outspoken and very curious. He has little to no shame. In several occasions, both in manga and anime, he is either seen doing drag or wearing animal costumes. There have been several instances in which his antics actually solved the problems of those around him. He also displays a surprising amount of talent at singing songs and changing their wordings. On rare occasions, he displays bouts of selfless kindness. For example, in one anime episode he saved a frog from a truck on a rainy day, becoming wet and dirty in the process and risking Misae's ire since it was his last set of clean clothes. In another episode, he gives Masao the change he has even though he knows that his mother will scold him later. However, these are often immediately followed by antics that negate the goodwill others feel. A running gag in the series involves Shin-chan being late for the bus to his school, usually due to taking a long time in the bathroom, leading Misae to begrudgingly having to take him to school on her bike. Although he always tease his mother, he is very close to his mother. There are also times when Shin-chan displays a level of maturity beyond his usual self in his concern for others, and in a few rare instances he shows that deep down he really does care for his family, although he usually behaves badly with them. He is also the leader of the Kasukabe Defence Force. :He is known as Shin-chan Nohara in the Vitello, Phuuz and Funimation dubs, and the jokes he makes in the Funimation dub are more adult. =Misae Nohara= :Shin- chan's mother from Kyushu. She is 29 and a typical housewife of post-war Japan: She cleans, launders, cooks, sews, mothers Shin-chan and his sister, and lazes. She is a tough and strong woman. While at heart a caring and nurturing individual, her positive aspects are often offset by her many shortcomings. A paragon of hypocrisy, after handing out irrevocable edicts to her husband and children, she will not hesitate to immediately break them once they are out of sight. Her famous and symbolic moves includes \\"drilling\\" others' head with her fists (known as \\"guri-guri\\") and a series of punches on the head, creating comically large lumps (the punches are mainly thrown by Misae, but other characters have been known to use it as well, such as Hiroshi and even Nene. Her son often makes fun of her habitual constipation, as well as her fluctuating weight and small breasts. :While she spends as little as possible on the less-essential needs of her husband and son, she loves to splurge on Himawari and herself, though she is noted to have instances of great generosity. She always changes her hairstyles as seen it is sometimes curly and sometimes long and shattered hair. Most of her luxury purchases, however, often end up broken, misused or otherwise ruined by her children, sometimes even before she had a chance to try them. She is the source of boundless diet and savings plans, all of which fail within the first week or even first day. She is prone to immediately partake in bargain sales when she sees them, thinking she is saving the family money. She then buys extreme quantities, regardless of the practicality, which defeats the purpose. Additionally she secretly hoards money for her own personal use. She is also known to be a terrible driver. Misae also constantly checks Shin-chan's and Hiroshi's behavior around young women and punishes them accordingly (and always seems to be in the right place at the right time when it comes to the latter). She was born in Aso, Kumamoto. :She is known as Mitsy Nohara in the Vitello and Phuuz dubs. :She is known as Mitzi Nohara in the Funimation dub. A recurring joke in the dub revolves around her stashing away money into her \\"boob job jar\\" to save up for breast implants. :She is known as Mitshi Nohara in the Indian dub. =Hiroshi Nohara= :Shin-chan's father from Akita in Northern Japan, and is the sole source of income. Also known as Harry, he is a loving father to his two children, and ultimately a devoted husband. While he is the family bread-winner, he hands the reins of finance over to his wife, who maintains a totalitarian level of control on family spending. At age 35, he is a stereotypical Japanese salaryman, working eight-hour days, enduring overstuffed trains, enjoying the occasional nightlife, and giving every bit of his take home pay to his wife every month. While his relationship with his family is positive on the whole, there is an abundance of recurring conflict. He and his wife bicker on many different things, from how little he gets for spending money every month, to whose turn it is to give the baby a bath. Misae is also notorious for inflicting violence on Hiroshi whenever she gets very angry (usually when his gaze wanders to younger women). He often dreams about being a playboy while he sleeps as an escape, though this is usually interrupted by some external stimulation. He enjoys a playful relationship with his children; but sometimes they're the source of his problems. He loves a cold beer after work and shares Shin-chan's appreciation of TV shows with young women in skimpy clothing, often becoming too excited about it for Misae's liking. He will not hesitate to save his allowance for things he wants, but can be seen spending much of it on things for family. A running joke is made of the pungent odor of his feethttp://www.tv- asahi.co.jp/buyers/contents/programguide/0001/data/7.pdf#toolbar=0&navpanes;=0 and his socks are often used as weapons by other members of the family. He was born in Omagari, Akita (a village in Daisen, Akita) and graduated from Waseda University. :He is known as Harry Nohara in the Vitello and Phuuz dubs. :He is known as Hiro Nohara in the Funimation dub. =Himawari Nohara= :Shin-chan's sister and the youngest child of the Nohara family, born in 1996. A precocious and vibrant infant. While technically newborn, her character has matured and grow n more intelligent during her stay in the series. She possesses a palpable lust for shiny objects (jewels and precious metals) and brand-name goods, being able to discern a real jewel from a simple piece of imitation (and throwing away the latter). She emulates her mother in her utterly stubborn pursuit of handsome young men who catch her eye, not unlike her brother, who soon discovered that a way to pacify her was to put on a cutout mask of a known handsome actor. In her family, she is an icon of adoration and annoyance, causing trouble she cannot be blamed for given her infantile innocence. She can be extremely fast crawling, tiring out even Shin-chan, and often uses Shiro as a toy. Her name, which is Japanese for \\"sunflower\\", was chosen by the show's viewership and not the creator. It is also hinted that she might marry Kazama. After becoming big her friends are Nike Sakurada (Nene's sister), Nizu Suzuki (Bo's sister) and some more children. :She is known as Daisy Nohara in the Vitello and Phuuz dubs. :She is known as Hima Nohara in the Funimation dub. =Shiro Nohara = : : is a white, fluffy pup Shin-chan found in a cardboard box early in the series. While a beloved member of the family, he is the subject of neglect thanks to his owner's forgetfulness and short attention-span. He is a very intelligent dog, often presenting logic and intellect that surpasses his human owners. As his meals from the Noharas are at best inconsistent, he has developed a talent for foraging, though other times he has to eat Misae's failed culinary experiments. An oddly human-like dog, he is very responsible and painstakingly careful. He takes care of his owners diligently, though often they do not realize his help or understand what he is trying to show them. His doghouse also often ends up becoming a place for Shin-chan to hide himself or something he doesn't want his family to find. He often plays protector to Himawari, more often than not sacrificing his well being in the process. :He is known as Lucky in the Vitello and Phuuz dubs. :He is known as Whitey in the Funimation dub, and he has an added British voice over. It is mentioned that he had a brother named \\"Blackey\\" that was also owned by Shin's family who was hit by a car. :He is known as Whitey in the LUK Internacional dub. Misae's family ; : :Misae's 63-year-old father and Shin-chan and Himawari's maternal grandfather. As a retired teacher, he has much higher standards of public decorum than Hiroshi's father Ginnosuke. This results in him constantly arguing with Ginnosuke. Although he is stubborn (a trait that passed to his daughters and grandson.) and conservative, he is actually a caring person. He likes his grandson. He is occasionally childish and argues with his wife about very minor things, often resulting in him and Ginnosuke going to the Noharas. :He is known as Waldo in the Vitello and Phuuz dubs. :He is known as Yoshi Koyama in the Funimation dub. :He is known as Yoshio Koyama in the Indian Dub. ; : :Misae's 58-year-old mother and Shin-chan and Himawari's maternal grandmother. Her appearances in Shin-chan episodes are usually with her husband. Like her husband, she looks down on the way Hiroshi's father behaves, but she gets along well with Ginnosuke's wife Tsuru. She always fights over little things with her husband Yoshiji. :In the Funimation dub, she is referenced as repeatedly having threatened to kill herself in the past, frequently stating \\"this makes me think twice about suicide\\" as a reaction to various things. ; : :Misae's 35-year-old older sister as well as Shin-Chan and Himawari's older aunt . She is a spinster who works at the same middle school her father used to work as a Japanese literature teacher. Her appearances on the show are rare. She usually appears as an elegant and well spoken kimono wearing lady, yet as a sharp contrast to her elegant image, she unexpectedly shares some of the same mischievous antics as Shin-chan and Ginnosuke (such as putting on a werewolf‚Äôs mask upon entering Nohara‚Äôs house as a prank or singing song making fun of Misae‚Äôs body with Shin-chan), though it is possible that Misae learned some of her moves from her. :She is known as Minnie in the Vitello and Phuuz dubs. ; : :Misae's 26-year-old younger sister and Shin-chan and Himawari's aunt. She is also a spinster and is very lazy and likes to eat snacks and sleep all the time. She dreams of becoming a photographer and her wish fulfills. She often makes a mess in the room she lives in. Compared to her sisters, she is more childlike hence she connects well with local kids. :Shinchan call her as \\"Masi\\"(maternal aunt) in Indian dub and She is known as \\"Bitzi Koyama\\" in the Funimation dub, and is stated to be a \\"Brown-brown\\" addict. Hiroshi's family ; : :Hiroshi's 65-year-old father, Shin-chan and Himawari's paternal grandfather. Like his son and his grandson, Shin-chan, he enjoys looking at and flirting with pretty young women. He also likes to do weird things with his grandson and taught him many of his habits. He is affectionately called Gin-chan. When he visits the Noharas, he always stays for much longer than Misae would like, leading to friction between the two. He greets the family in various strange (and often embarrassing) ways whenever they visit Akita, such as dressing as various movie characters. Another running gag in the series is that he suddenly appears in Kasukabe out of nowhere. :In the Funimation dub, he is affectionately called \\"Gin\\" and \\"roamed\\" the countryside on a motorcycle when he was younger. :He is known as Gary in the Vitello and Phuuz dubs. ; : :Hiroshi's 62-year-old mother, Shin- chan and Himawari's paternal grandmother. Although she seems to be more mature than her husband, she acts more strangely in front of Shin-chan and Himawari. One of her most shameless act is the ‚Äúsaggy hag‚Äôs belly dance‚Äù which Shin-chan once asked if ‚Äúthey can be tied into a knot?‚Äù ; :Hiroshi's 40-year-old brother, Shin-chan and Himawari's uncle, he never appeared in the anime. He works as a farmer, he's not very smart and rarely expresses any emotions. In the manga he‚Äôs known to be extremely stingy. Futaba Kindergarten In the Japanese anime, the school is called . In the Funimation dub, it is renamed to Super Happy Fun Time American School. Funimation head writer Jared Hedges states that the Americanization of the school was done to use the characters as an outlet for American humor and references while keeping the show location in Japan. =Sunflower  ; :An \\"organization\\" that Shin-chan and his friends created as a group in the episode 143 \\"Kasukabe Defence Force\\". The purpose of this group was to promote peace in Kasukabe, but they hardly do anything meaningful during their operations, ironically causing many troubles when they do \\"defend\\". Their secret base is located at teacher Yoshinaga's room and the buildings stairs. Even though they usually fight about who is going to be leader, eventually Shin-chan is the leader as he mostly stands in the middle and shout their slogan while the others follow when doing something important. :It is known as the Kazhukids in the Vitello and Phuuz dubs, as Kasukabe is called Kazhu in these dubs. :It is known as Kasukabe Defence Group in the Indian dub. =Kazama Toru= :T≈çru Kazama is Shin-chan's immaculately groomed and perfectly mannered friend, who usually loses his mind when Shin- chan tease him and other things. He also bickers and fight with words with Shin Chan sometimes. Despite that, they are actually closer than any of the other friends they have. A strong evidence is that when Kazama was extremely frustrated and lonely in several episodes, Shin-chan was the only one who stayed with him. Even though Kazama always denied when Shin Chan says that he is his most best friend, his best friend is Shin Chan too. Of all Shin-chan's friends, he's the only one referred to by his family name (Kazama-kun). Only his mother uses his given name (T≈çru-chan). He participates in extracurricular activities like English Conversation and seems knowledgeable in any subject (even if he is not), which makes him look snobbish. He plays association football and baseball very well. He likes female animation and comic book characters, though he tries to hide that fact from his friends. He also has a strong attachment to his mother that hints at him having an Oedipus Complex. A recurring theme in the show is that he tries to hang out with upper class girls his age to be a part of the \\"elite\\", but runs across Shin-chan being weird which ultimately causes the girl to lose interest in hanging out with him. He sometimes like a girl from tuition classes. It is hinted that Kazama might marry Himawari in the future. :He is known as Cosmo in the Vitello and Phuuz dubs. :He is known as Georgie Herbert Walker Prescott III in the Funimation dub and is changed into an ultra-conservative Republican American. In the third season, it is stated that his family lost most of their money due to the economic recession, though he attempts to hide this from his peers. ; \\" Nene Chan\\" : :Age: 5 (First appearance), 6 (Current) :Nene Sakurada (Nene- chan) is Shin-chan's female classmate and the only one female best friend. She has a crush on Shin-chan. Her nickname is Nene-chan. She loves to play 'real omamagoto', or 'real house', in which divorces and arguments are very common and she typically forces/blackmails the boys to play with her. This is always a nuisance to Shin-chan, Bo-chan, and Kazama-kun and a nightmare to Masao as he often needs to be Nene's husband (unsuccessful salaryman) in the plot. She occasionally sees her mother go crazy or do something out of character and shrieks something literally translated to be \\"You're not my usual mom!\\". Nene styles herself as a sweet girl, but in fact she has inherited her mother's temper and is quite bossy. She is a tough and strong girl. Like her mother, she hits a stuffed bunny to relieve her anger. Alternatively, Nene uses Masao as the lightning rod for her anger and frustration when her bunny is not available. She considers Ai her rival. They always seen fighting for Shin-chan for example who is going to play with him or who is going to sleep beside him. She is the only female member of Kasukabe Defence Force. She has a sister named Nike Sakurada (Niku-chan). She has many pet cats whom she loves a lot. :She is known as Nini in the Vitello and Phuuz dubs. :She is known as Penny is the Funimation dub, and is referred to as being from a poor family with an abusive father, which is frequently used as black comedy. :In the LUK Internacional dub she has a British accent. ; : :Age: 5 (First appearance), 6 (Current) :Masao Sato is the smallest member of Kasukabe Defence Force. He is known to be a scaredy cat and a cry baby. He is also a \\"clean freak\\" bordering on Obsessive Compulsive. Shin-chan and Nene sometimes bully him but not in a bad way. For example, when Masao show his friends he had kept a four leaf clover which proves to had bring him luck, Shin-chan and Nene steal the leaf from him and fight for it until the leaf tear apart which make Masao cry. His nickname is \\"Onigiri\\" due to his shaven head's resemblance to a rice ball, and there are several moments where Shin-chan accidentally mistook Masao's head for a rice ball and even tried to eat it. Shin-chan and Nene often call him 'onigiri'. His friends use it as a term of endearment, while the people that bully him use it as a put-down. His hobby is to write comics. Masao is in love with Ai and jealous at Shin-chan because Ai loves Shin-chan but they are still best friends. His father owns a supermarket from which all his friends buy material. :He is known as Max in the Vitello and Phuuz dubs. :He is known as Maso Sato in the Funimation dub. The Funimation website says that Maso is like \\"Linus without his blanket.\\"\\"Official Shin-chan website.\\" Funimation. Retrieved on September 30, 2009. The dub features a running joke implying that Maso is gay, due to his timid and occasionally effeminate nature. ; \\" Bo - Chan\\" : :Age: 5 (First appearance), 6 (Current) :Another of Shin-chan's friends Bo - Chan, he seems slow and expressionless, but is actually quite smart and has an interest in artistic, adult-oriented things. He loves to collect various kinds of stone and investigating urban legends and various mysterious objects such as UFOs. He often surprises his friends with his insight, though he speaks quite slowly. He has a sister named Nisu-chan. He always has a trail of mucus running down his nose and can perform various tricks with it. :He is known as Boo in the Funimation dub, and he says he never wipes it away because he thinks that his snot is the source of his \\"power\\". He is portrayed as a stupid kid who often says nonsensical things like a sufferer from Tourette syndrome.

She is always seen riding in a black limousine and with a bodyguard. She is very manipulative and purposely bends people to her will just because she can. For example, she made many boys at Futaba Kindergarten fall in love with her. However, when she tried to do the same to Shin-chan, she failed. Because of that, she fell in love with Shin-chan and being the manipulator she is, uses his weaknesses (Action Mask, Chocobi, etc.) to get him to notice her. Masao likes her very much, but Ai almost never pays attention to him. When she does pay attention to him, she makes him act as her pet.

However, they are still beaten most of the time in competition with the Sunflower Class because of Shin Chan and friends. ; : :Yasuo is always wearing a leopard shirt and playing with his soccer ball, thus got his last name \\"Cheetah\\" but Shinnosuke kept referring to him wrongly by random words that sound partially similar much to his dismay and thus a running gag . He has a fierce dislike of Shinnosuke and Kazama and usually gets into shouting matches with the latter. He also loves to bully Masao. Even though he is confident in his athletic ability and acts as the Rose Class' leader, he almost always loses to the Sunflower Class because of Shin Chan and his friends. He has formed a clique with classmates Hitoshi and Terunobu. ; : :This child is a kindergarten bully and always likes to bully Masao with Terunobu. :In the Funimation dub, he is unnamed, and is portrayed as a second-grader instead of a kindergartener. ; : :This child is a kindergarten bully and always likes to bully Masao with Hitoshi.

Likes to live stylishly in public but she actually struggles to save her money for luxuries and lives in a very cheap, dusty apartment. She dislikes her given name as she always says to Yoshinaga and others, \\"Don't call me Ume!\\". This is due to one of the meanings of \\"Ume\\", which can mean \\"3rd class\\" or \\"low class\\". Although she said before she is \\"tired of Futaba Kindergarten (especially Shin-chan and friends)\\" and plans to move out to a better school, she never seriously intends to do it.

Often, when news comes of Ume going on a date or participating in a matchmaking ceremony, Matsu and her other sister, Take, would interfere to win that man's affections, leading to the three sisters fighting over him and eventually ends up with the man she is interested in escaping from the sisters.

In these sources, for example the Song of Deborah, the Gilead group is treated with equal status to the other Israelite tribes, while certain other tribes, including the Tribe of Manasseh, are absent. An eponymous Gilead is mentioned in the biblical genealogies as a descendant of Manasseh,Numbers 26:29 presumably implying that the Gilead group was part of Manasseh, and since Gilead is also the name of a specific part of the land east of the Jordan River, the Gilead tribal group presumably refers to the half tribe of Manasseh which resided on this side of the Jordan. The identity as part of a single tribe named Manasseh, doesn't appear to have been fully accurate in practice, since there was very little geographic connection between the two half tribes, only just touching at a corner of each, and according to the Book of Chronicles each half tribe historically had always had separate tribal rulers.1 Chronicles 27:20-21 How much of the half tribe the Gilead group constituted is unclear, since a tribal group named Machir is given equal status to Gilead in the early biblical passages, as a separate group rather than as a group containing the Gilead group within it, and an eponymous Machir, also descended from Manasseh, is mentioned as having conquered and also settled on the eastern side of the Jordan. The biblical genealogy of Manasseh, which textual scholars regard as dating from centuries after the passages mentioning Gilead and Machir as tribal groups,Peake's commentary on the Bible identify Machir as the immediate father of Gilead, raising the question of how this could be consistent with the earlier passages treating the Machir group as distinct from the Gilead group.

It stands facing Jackson Square, adjacent to the St. Louis Cathedral. Built in 1791 as a matching structure for the Cabildo, which flanks the cathedral on the other side, it is one of the nation's best examples of formal colonial Spanish architecture (with many neo-Renaissance elements). It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970, and is now a property of the Louisiana State Museum. Description  The Presbyt√®re is located on the northeast side of Jackson Square, between the cathedral and St. Ann Street. It is a two-story brick building, originally built with a flat roof that had a balustrade topped by urns. Its ground floor has a nine-bay open arcade of elliptical arches, with pilastered corners. The upper level also has arched openings, all articulated by pilasters, with multipane windows. The center three bays on both levels have engaged columns on either side, and are topped as a group by a gabled pediment. A dormered mansard roof was added in 1847, which is topped by a louvered cupola. History The Presbyt√®re was designed in 1791 by the French-born Gilberto Guillemard to match the Cabildo, or Town Hall, on the other side of St. Louis Cathedral. By 1798, only the first floor had been completed, and its second floor was not completed until 1813. Originally called the ' (‚ÄòEcclesiastical House‚Äô), its name derives from the fact that it was built on the former site of the residence of the Capuchin monks and presbytery (rectory, ' in French). While intended to house clergy, it was never used as a religious residence.New Orleans Times-Picayune, Jun 24, 2005 The building initially was used for commercial purposes until 1834, when it was used by the Louisiana Supreme Court. In 1853, cathedral officials sold the Presbyt√®re to the city, and in 1908 the city sold it to the state. In 1911 it became part of the Louisiana State Museum. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970. and View of Jackson Square. The Cathedral is the central building, with the Cabildo to the left and the Presbytere to the right.

Its authorship is debated because the earliest surviving copy is written in the hand of Chimalpahin (1579‚Äì1660), while the manuscript itself states that the author is Fernando Alvarado Tezoz√≥moc (before 1542 ‚Äì 1610).Schroeder, S. (2011). The Truth about the Cr√≥nica Mexicayotl. Colonial Latin American Review, 20(2), 233‚Äì247. A description of the manuscript is included in the census of central Mexican prose writings in the Handbook of Middle American Indians.Gibson, Charles. \\"Prose sources in the Native Historical Tradition\\", article 27B. \\"A Census of Middle American Prose Manuscripts in the Native Historical Tradition\\". Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources Part 4; Handbook of Middle American Indians. University of Texas Press 1975, pp. 326‚Äì427. The oldest extant version of the manuscript, written by Chimalpahin, is designated MS374 and was held at the University of Cambridge until 2013. In 2014, it was repatriated by the Mexican National Institute for Archeology and History, and is now on display at the Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City. In the 18th century, a copy of the manuscript was made by Lorenzo Boturini who published it in Tome 4 of his 1746 \\"Cat√°logo del museo hist√≥rico indiano\\". In the late 19th century, Boturini's manuscript was copied by father Jos√© Pichardo and Antonion Le√≥n y Gama, whose manuscript is designated (MS 311); this tertiary copy is now held at the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France in Paris. Peperstraete, Sylvie, and Gabriel Kenrick Kruell. \\"Determining the Authorship of the Cr√≥nica Mexicayotl: Two Hypotheses.\\" The Americas 71, no. 2 (2014): 315-338. In 1949, working from photocopies of the tertiary manuscript MS311, Adrian Le√≥n translated the Cr√≥nica Mexicayotl into Spanish and the National Autonomous University of Mexico published it with the Nahuatl and Spanish text. This version has since been published in several editions, but being based on the tertiary version it contains errors and omissions. In 1997, American ethnohistorians Susan Schroeder and Arthur J. O. Anderson translated the earliest manuscript, MS374, into English and published it as part of their book Codex Chimalpahin. A Spanish translation by Rafael Tena was published in 2013, and a German translation of the same by Berthold Riese was published in 2004. Authorship The problem of the authorship of the Cr√≥nica Mexicayotl arose in early studies of the document, since the introduction explicitly names Tezoz√≥moc as the author, although the document itself is written in Chimalpahin's hand and with additions in which Chimalpahin mentions himself by name. Alexis Aubin considered that Chimalpahin simply copied and annotated the text from an original manuscript by Tezoz√≥moc. Paul Kirchoff argued that there is a stylistic break between the first part of the Cr√≥nica and the second, and argued that the first part was written by Tezoz√≥moc and the second by Chimalpahin. In contrast, Susan Schroeder has argued that the Cr√≥nica Mexicayotl was Chimalpahin's original work and that only the introduction was by Tezoz√≥moc ‚Äì and that it was in fact not an introduction to the Cr√≥nica, but an appendix to the work Historia o Cr√≥nica Mexicana which precedes the Cr√≥nica in the volume of the MS374. Schroeder has been contradicted by Peperstraete and Kruell, who argue that Tezoz√≥moc's authorship of the main part of the Cr√≥nica Mexicayotl is established by the introduction (which they argue can only properly be considered an introduction and not an appendix to another work), and by the fact that most of the chronicle is about Tezoz√≥moc's family using sources that would only have been available to him. They also add that Tezoz√≥moc's Spanish-language Cr√≥nica Mexicana is essentially a translation of the Cr√≥nica Mexicayotl ‚Äì making it all the more likely that both works are of his authorship. They consider that in writing the Cr√≥nica Mexicayotl, Tezoz√≥moc may have also worked from the so-called Cr√≥nica X, a purported lost document of Mexican history which was also used by other authors for their works. As for Chimalpahin's role, they argue that Chimalpahin not only copied the manuscript but also added and intercalated some parts into Tezoz√≥moc's text. Peperstraete and Kruell argue that Tezoz√≥moc's original version of the Cr√≥nica Mexicayotl would have been elaborated before 1581, because they believe that fray Diego Dur√°n consulted this manuscript in preparing his own History of the Indies of New Spain.

Automotive engines During the 1920s there was rapid development in the design of diesel engines. In 1929 a Gardner \\"4L2\\" marine engine was fitted into a Lancia bus. This conversion was successful and prompted Gardner to introduce the \\"LW\\" series of diesel engines, designed especially for road vehicles but later modified and supplied as a marine engines with factory-fitted bilge pumps. The LW engine was a modular design, with separate cast iron cylinder blocks and cylinder heads comprising either 2 or 3 cylinders. A 5-cylinder engine would thus use a \\"2\\" and a \\"3\\", whereas a 6-cylinder engine could have either 3 \\"2\\"s or 2 \\"3\\"s. Boat engines had a cast iron crankcase, whereas (in the interest of lightness) road vehicles would have an aluminium alloy crankcase. Any boat engine with an alloy crankcase would be a marinised road engine. During the 1930s a number of LW-series engines (usually 4LWs, but occasionally 6LWs) were installed in large luxury cars including Lagondas, Bentleys and Rolls-Royces. The Gardner engine's reliability and economy (tests showed that even a two-ton Bentley could achieve 30 miles per gallon of fuel while having a top speed of 80 mph), coupled to its remarkable refinement and smooth running abilities, made it the only suitable compression-ignition engine at the time During World War II (1939‚Äì1945) Gardner's war work consisted mainly of building diesel engines of their own design. Their 4LK bus engines were also used as the main powerplant in the Royal Navy's X class and XE class midget submarines.http://www.gardnerengineforum.co.uk/Web%20PDF%20Versions/Newsletter%2011.pdf Post-war diesels A Sectioned 6LW of 1961 at the Anson Engine Museum from a Bristol Commercial Vehicles bus. After the war the 'LW' diesel engine continued to be built in large numbers for lorries and buses and was later supplemented by the more modern 'LX'. In the mid-sixties, the LW range was upgraded to develop 20 bhp per cylinder, and known as LW20. The 6LX was upgraded in 1967 from 150 bhp @1700rpm to 180 bhp @1850rpm. An 8-cylinder version was developed which developed 240 bhp @ 1850rpm, and was said to be the smoothest running automotive diesel ever built. The larger '6L3' and '8L3' engines were used in railway locomotives, such as British Rail Class 01 and 04 and also in vessels of up to 120 feet such as MV Havengore, and maxi yachts Condor and Condor of Bermuda. Takeover and decline In June 1976 Rolls- Royce acquired a 17% shareholding.Gardner vs Rolls in takeover move Commercial Motor 25 June 1975 page 3Rolls-Royce buys stake in Gardner Truck & Bus Transportation August 1976 page 37 In December 1977 the business was purchased by Hawker Siddeley.Hawker looks set to get Gardner Commercial Motor 22 July 1977 page 4Hawker upstages Rolls-Royce Motors The Times 23 December 1977 In the summer of 1986, after months of denials, Perkins Engines purchased Gardner to complement their line of lighter diesel engines. Production was then shut down until October, as Gardner's truck engine market share had slumped precariously. Gardner's market for buses and coaches was doing better. L. Gardner and Sons ceased production of new engines in the early 1990s. The introduction of emissions regulations for road-going Gardner diesels would have required the development of significantly modified or totally new engine designs, and in the marine market there was a shift away from big, low-speed, high-torque engines such as Gardners towards adapted high-speed automotive turbodiesels. =Restorers and parts suppliers= Two spin-off firms from the original company are still in existence: Gardner Marine Diesels overhauls, re- manufactures and installs a wide range of marine-spec Gardners and both they and Walsh Engineering supply genuine Gardner engine parts for all types of Gardner engines worldwide.

As with most mathematical paradoxes, they generally reveal surprising and counter-intuitive mathematical results, rather than actual logical contradictions within modern axiomatic set theory.  Basics = Cardinal numbers = Set theory as conceived by Georg Cantor assumes the existence of infinite sets. As this assumption cannot be proved from first principles it has been introduced into axiomatic set theory by the axiom of infinity, which asserts the existence of the set N of natural numbers. Every infinite set which can be enumerated by natural numbers is the same size (cardinality) as N, and is said to be countable. Examples of countably infinite sets are the natural numbers, the even numbers, the prime numbers, and also all the rational numbers, i.e., the fractions. These sets have in common the cardinal number N = \\\\aleph_0 (aleph-nought), a number greater than every natural number. Cardinal numbers can be defined as follows. Define two sets to have the same size by: there exists a bijection between the two sets (a one-to-one correspondence between the elements). Then a cardinal number is, by definition, a class consisting of all sets of the same size. To have the same size is an equivalence relation, and the cardinal numbers are the equivalence classes. = Ordinal numbers = Besides the cardinality, which describes the size of a set, ordered sets also form a subject of set theory. The axiom of choice guarantees that every set can be well-ordered, which means that a total order can be imposed on its elements such that every nonempty subset has a first element with respect to that order. The order of a well-ordered set is described by an ordinal number. For instance, 3 is the ordinal number of the set {0, 1, 2} with the usual order 0 < 1 < 2; and œâ is the ordinal number of the set of all natural numbers ordered the usual way. Neglecting the order, we are left with the cardinal number N = œâ = \\\\aleph_0. Ordinal numbers can be defined with the same method used for cardinal numbers. Define two well-ordered sets to have the same order type by: there exists a bijection between the two sets respecting the order: smaller elements are mapped to smaller elements. Then an ordinal number is, by definition, a class consisting of all well-ordered sets of the same order type. To have the same order type is an equivalence relation on the class of well-ordered sets, and the ordinal numbers are the equivalence classes. Two sets of the same order type have the same cardinality. The converse is not true in general for infinite sets: it is possible to impose different well-orderings on the set of natural numbers that give rise to different ordinal numbers. There is a natural ordering on the ordinals, which is itself a well-ordering. Given any ordinal Œ±, one can consider the set of all ordinals less than Œ±. This set turns out to have ordinal number Œ±. This observation is used for a different way of introducing the ordinals, in which an ordinal is equated with the set of all smaller ordinals. This form of ordinal number is thus a canonical representative of the earlier form of equivalence class. = Power sets = By forming all subsets of a set S (all possible choices of its elements), we obtain the power set P(S). Georg Cantor proved that the power set is always larger than the set, i.e., P(S) > S. A special case of Cantor's theorem proves that the set of all real numbers R cannot be enumerated by natural numbers. R is uncountable: R > N.  Paradoxes of the infinite set  Instead of relying on ambiguous descriptions such as \\"that which cannot be enlarged\\" or \\"increasing without bound\\", set theory provides definitions for the term infinite set to give an unambiguous meaning to phrases such as \\"the set of all natural numbers is infinite\\". Just as for finite sets, the theory makes further definitions which allow us to consistently compare two infinite sets as regards whether one set is \\"larger than\\", \\"smaller than\\", or \\"the same size as\\" the other. But not every intuition regarding the size of finite sets applies to the size of infinite sets, leading to various apparently paradoxical results regarding enumeration, size, measure and order. = Paradoxes of enumeration = Before set theory was introduced, the notion of the size of a set had been problematic. It had been discussed by Galileo Galilei and Bernard Bolzano, among others. Are there as many natural numbers as squares of natural numbers when measured by the method of enumeration? * The answer is yes, because for every natural number n there is a square number n2, and likewise the other way around. * The answer is no, because the squares are a proper subset of the naturals: every square is a natural number but there are natural numbers, like 2, which are not squares of natural numbers. By defining the notion of the size of a set in terms of its cardinality, the issue can be settled. Since there is a bijection between the two sets involved, this follows in fact directly from the definition of the cardinality of a set. See Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel for more on paradoxes of enumeration. = Je le vois, mais je ne crois pas = \\"I see it but I don't believe,\\" Cantor wrote to Richard Dedekind after proving that the set of points of a square has the same cardinality as that of the points on just an edge of the square: the cardinality of the continuum. This demonstrates that the \\"size\\" of sets as defined by cardinality alone is not the only useful way of comparing sets. Measure theory provides a more nuanced theory of size that conforms to our intuition that length and area are incompatible measures of size. The evidence strongly suggests that Cantor was quite confident in the result itself and that his comment to Dedekind refers instead to his then-still-lingering concerns about the validity of his proof of it.F. Q. Gouv√™a, \\"Was Cantor Surprised?\\", American Mathematical Monthly, 118, March 2011, 198‚Äì209. Nevertheless, Cantor's remark would also serve nicely to express the surprise that so many mathematicians after him have experienced on first encountering a result that is so counter-intuitive. = Paradoxes of well-ordering = In 1904 Ernst Zermelo proved by means of the axiom of choice (which was introduced for this reason) that every set can be well-ordered. In 1963 Paul J. Cohen showed that in Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice it is not possible to prove the existence of a well-ordering of the real numbers. However, the ability to well order any set allows certain constructions to be performed that have been called paradoxical. One example is the Banach‚ÄìTarski paradox, a theorem widely considered to be nonintuitive. It states that it is possible to decompose a ball of a fixed radius into a finite number of pieces and then move and reassemble those pieces by ordinary translations and rotations (with no scaling) to obtain two copies from the one original copy. The construction of these pieces requires the axiom of choice; the pieces are not simple regions of the ball, but complicated subsets.  Paradoxes of the Supertask  In set theory, an infinite set is not considered to be created by some mathematical process such as \\"adding one element\\" that is then carried out \\"an infinite number of times\\". Instead, a particular infinite set (such as the set of all natural numbers) is said to already exist, \\"by fiat\\", as an assumption or an axiom. Given this infinite set, other infinite sets are then proven to exist as well, as a logical consequence. But it is still a natural philosophical question to contemplate some physical action that actually completes after an infinite number of discrete steps; and the interpretation of this question using set theory gives rise to the paradoxes of the supertask. = The diary of Tristram Shandy = Tristram Shandy, the hero of a novel by Laurence Sterne, writes his autobiography so conscientiously that it takes him one year to lay down the events of one day. If he is mortal he can never terminate; but if he lived forever then no part of his diary would remain unwritten, for to each day of his life a year devoted to that day's description would correspond. = The Ross-Littlewood paradox = An increased version of this type of paradox shifts the infinitely remote finish to a finite time. Fill a huge reservoir with balls enumerated by numbers 1 to 10 and take off ball number 1. Then add the balls enumerated by numbers 11 to 20 and take off number 2. Continue to add balls enumerated by numbers 10n - 9 to 10n and to remove ball number n for all natural numbers n = 3, 4, 5, .... Let the first transaction last half an hour, let the second transaction last quarter an hour, and so on, so that all transactions are finished after one hour. Obviously the set of balls in the reservoir increases without bound. Nevertheless, after one hour the reservoir is empty because for every ball the time of removal is known. The paradox is further increased by the significance of the removal sequence. If the balls are not removed in the sequence 1, 2, 3, ... but in the sequence 1, 11, 21, ... after one hour infinitely many balls populate the reservoir, although the same amount of material as before has been moved.  Paradoxes of proof and definability  For all its usefulness in resolving questions regarding infinite sets, naive set theory has some fatal flaws. In particular, it is prey to logical paradoxes such as those exposed by Russell's paradox. The discovery of these paradoxes revealed that not all sets which can be described in the language of naive set theory can actually be said to exist without creating a contradiction. The 20th century saw a resolution to these paradoxes in the development of the various axiomatizations of set theories such as ZFC and NBG in common use today. However, the gap between the very formalized and symbolic language of these theories and our typical informal use of mathematical language results in various paradoxical situations, as well as the philosophical question of exactly what it is that such formal systems actually propose to be talking about. = Early paradoxes: the set of all sets = In 1897 the Italian mathematician Cesare Burali-Forti discovered that there is no set containing all ordinal numbers. As every ordinal number is defined by a set of smaller ordinal numbers, the well-ordered set Œ© of all ordinal numbers (if it exists) fits the definition and is itself an ordinal. On the other hand, no ordinal number can contain itself, so Œ© cannot be an ordinal. Therefore, the set of all ordinal numbers cannot exist. By the end of the 19th century Cantor was aware of the non-existence of the set of all cardinal numbers and the set of all ordinal numbers. In letters to David Hilbert and Richard Dedekind he wrote about inconsistent sets, the elements of which cannot be thought of as being all together, and he used this result to prove that every consistent set has a cardinal number. After all this, the version of the \\"set of all sets\\" paradox conceived by Bertrand Russell in 1903 led to a serious crisis in set theory. Russell recognized that the statement x = x is true for every set, and thus the set of all sets is defined by {x  x = x}. In 1906 he constructed several paradox sets, the most famous of which is the set of all sets which do not contain themselves. Russell himself explained this abstract idea by means of some very concrete pictures. One example, known as the Barber paradox, states: The male barber who shaves all and only men who don't shave themselves has to shave himself only if he does not shave himself. There are close similarities between Russell's paradox in set theory and the Grelling‚ÄìNelson paradox, which demonstrates a paradox in natural language. = Paradoxes by change of language = K√∂nig's paradox  In 1905, the Hungarian mathematician Julius K√∂nig published a paradox based on the fact that there are only countably many finite definitions. If we imagine the real numbers as a well- ordered set, those real numbers which can be finitely defined form a subset. Hence in this well-order there should be a first real number that is not finitely definable. This is paradoxical, because this real number has just been finitely defined by the last sentence. This leads to a contradiction in naive set theory. This paradox is avoided in axiomatic set theory. Although it is possible to represent a proposition about a set as a set, by a system of codes known as G√∂del numbers, there is no formula \\\\phi(a,x) in the language of set theory which holds exactly when a is a code for a finite description of a set and this description is a true description of the set x. This result is known as Tarski's indefinability theorem; it applies to a wide class of formal systems including all commonly studied axiomatizations of set theory.  Richard's paradox  In the same year the French mathematician Jules Richard used a variant of Cantor's diagonal method to obtain another contradiction in naive set theory. Consider the set A of all finite agglomerations of words. The set E of all finite definitions of real numbers is a subset of A. As A is countable, so is E. Let p be the nth decimal of the nth real number defined by the set E; we form a number N having zero for the integral part and p + 1 for the nth decimal if p is not equal either to 8 or 9, and unity if p is equal to 8 or 9. This number N is not defined by the set E because it differs from any finitely defined real number, namely from the nth number by the nth digit. But N has been defined by a finite number of words in this paragraph. It should therefore be in the set E. That is a contradiction. As with K√∂nig's paradox, this paradox cannot be formalized in axiomatic set theory because it requires the ability to tell whether a description applies to a particular set (or, equivalently, to tell whether a formula is actually the definition of a single set). = Paradox of L√∂wenheim and Skolem = Based upon work of the German mathematician Leopold L√∂wenheim (1915) the Norwegian logician Thoralf Skolem showed in 1922 that every consistent theory of first-order predicate calculus, such as set theory, has an at most countable model. However, Cantor's theorem proves that there are uncountable sets. The root of this seeming paradox is that the countability or noncountability of a set is not always absolute, but can depend on the model in which the cardinality is measured. It is possible for a set to be uncountable in one model of set theory but countable in a larger model (because the bijections that establish countability are in the larger model but not the smaller one).

The series stars Chip Gaines and Joanna Gaines, a married couple who own a home renovation and redecoration business in Waco, Texas. The show's pilot aired in May 2013, with the first full season beginning in April 2014, season two began in January 2015, season three began in December 2015, and season four began in November 2016. The fifth and final season premiered on November 21, 2017. Fixer Upper became popular soon after its debut, and the series is largely credited with the rise in popularity of \\"Farmhouse-chic\\" interior design in the late 2010s. In 2018, Zillow reported that homes with architectural features mentioned on the show, such as wainscoting, shiplap, clawfoot bathtubs, and barn doors, sold at an average of 30 percent above expected value. In addition, the show has generated an increase in tourism and economic development in Waco, Texas, where the show was filmed. Premise Fixer Upper is produced by High Noon Entertainment producers Scott Feeley and Jim Berger, producers of the cooking show Cake Boss. Prior to Fixer Upper, the Gaineses worked with clients on buying and remodeling homes. In total, the couple worked on over 100 homes. On the show, they start by showing a couple three potential homes for purchase in central Texas, each of which requires a varying amount of repair or renovation. Once the couple chooses their home, Joanna designs it and Chip is the lead contractor. The buyers typically have an overall budget of under $200,000 with at least $30,000 in renovations.  Episodes  Spin-off  In March 2017, it was announced that Chip and Joanna Gaines would be getting a Fixer Upper spin-off series entitled Fixer Upper: Behind the Design. The half-hour show showcases how Joanna comes up with the designs seen on Fixer Upper. The show premiered on April 10, 2018. Other business As of November 1, 2017, Joanna teamed with Target Corporation to offer her Hearth & Hand with Magnolia collection. The collection, available in stores and online, features 300 pieces including bedding and lifestyle products. In February 2019, she created an exclusive collection for Anthropologie of \\"globally inspired\\" rugs and pillows. On April 10, 2019, the Gaineses announced the launch of a \\"new media company.\\" They will serve as chief creative officers and current HGTV president Allison Page will serve as president of the new joint venture, which will reportedly include a TV network and a streaming app. In November 2019, the Gaineses opened a coffee shop, Magnolia Press, in Waco, Texas. The store was in addition to two others they already had, Magnolia Table and Silos Baking Co. On April 26, 2020, at 5pm EST, the soft launch of the cable network Magnolia Network kicked off with a four-hour presentation on the DIY Network: Magnolia Presents: A Look Back & A Look Ahead. DIY Network's rebranding as the Magnolia Network was originally going to be completed on October 4, 2020, but the date was pushed back due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. On August 4, 2020, it was announced that the network would launch in 2021, with Fixer Upper premiering at the launch of the network. Legacy Fixer Upper is largely credited with the rise in popularity of \\"Farmhouse-chic\\" interior design in the late 2010s. In 2018, Zillow reported that homes with architectural features mentioned on the show, such as wainscoting, shiplap, clawfoot bathtubs, and barn doors, sold at an average of 30 percent above expected value. In addition, the show has generated an increase in tourism and economic development in Waco, Texas, where the show was filmed. Thanks to the show's popularity, the homes featured on the show have become desirable to either purchase or rent. At least six of the homes are available to rent through Airbnb or VRBO. Owners are renting them for anywhere from $250 to $350 a night. Selling the homes renovated by the Gaineses has also become a way for show participants to make a profit. The Bicycle House featured in Season 1, Episode 12 went up for sale in 2016 for $350,000 after being purchased for less than $50,000. It was also available for rent on VRBO for $250 a night. The Barndominium featured in Season 3, Episode 6 went up for sale in April 2017 for $1.2 million.  Legal issues  On April 27, 2017, Chip Gaines was named in a fraud lawsuit filed by former business partners. The former partners alleged that the Gaineses persuaded them to sell their interest in Magnolia Realty to him for $2,500 each without disclosing plans that had been in the works to develop the Fixer Upper reality television show. His attorney, Jordan Mayfield, told KWTX-TV, the CBS television station in Waco, Texas, \\"We are confident that these claims will be found to be meritless, and it is disappointing to see people try to take advantage of the hard work and success of Chip and Joanna Gaines.\\"Carroll, John. ‚ÄúFixer Upper‚Äù star Chip Gaines named in million dollar lawsuit, KWTX-TV, April 27, 2017. In another matter, in June 2017, it was announced that they \\"settled with the United States Environmental Protection Agency over allegations that they violated rules for the safe handling of lead paint during home renovations.\\" They paid $40,000 in fines and will comply with such regulations going forward, and \\"remain committed to raising awareness in our community and our industry.\\"  References  External links  *Fixer Upper on HGTV * Category:2010s American reality television series Category:2013 American television series debuts Category:2018 American television series endings Category:HGTV original programming Category:Television shows set in Waco, Texas Category:Home renovation television series Category:American television series revived after cancellation ","title":"Fixer Upper (TV series)"},{"id":"10410109","text":"Acacia sassa is a legume that grows in the forests of Senegal.Convention on Biological Diversity It was first described by Carl Ludwig von Willdenow.

It is used in many areas for various purposes. The tree varies from 3 to 25 m in height, with a trunk diameter of 0.6 to 1.8 m.World Agroforestry Centre It is not listed as being a threatened species. Uses Vachellia sieberiana is valued largely as a source of forage, medicine and wood. The inner bark is a source of fibre purposes such as stringing beads). The gum is edible) and both livestock and game animals browse the tree and feed on the dropped pods, spreading viable seeds in their dung. The flowers of the tree make good forage for bees and bee hives are put directly in the trees to exploit the resource. The leaves of the tree commonly release toxic chemical compounds when the tree has been heavily browsed, some of the compounds may release hydrogen cyanide when ingested, which may be lethal to cattle. The fallen pods and foliage can provide lifesaving forage during dry times of the year. The gum of the tree is used as food, as an adhesive, and as an ingredient in making ink. =Traditional medicinal uses= In Africa, the bark or root is used to treat urinary tract inflammation. The bark has astringent properties and it is used to treat colds, cough, and childhood fever. According to the World AgroForestry Centre, > \\"A decoction of the root is taken as remedy for stomach-ache. The bark, > leaves and gums are used to treat tapeworm, bilharzia, haemorrhage, > orchitis, colds, diarrhoea, gonorrhoea, kidney problems, syphilis, > ophthalmia, rheumatism and disorders of the circulatory system. It is also > used as an astringent. The pods serve as an emollient, and the roots for > stomach-ache, acne, tapeworms, urethral problems, oedema and dropsy.\\" =Nitrogen fixation= Vachellia sieberiana is a legume and like many legumes it hosts Rhizobium bacteria in its roots. The bacteria fix nitrogen gas from the air and, without requiring nitrogen fertilizer or soil nitrates, they convert it into nitrogen compounds necessary for plant nutrition. Ultimately, surrounding plants also benefit from the increase in available nitrogen, which means that plants such as Vachellia species are of particular ecological importance. =Tannin= Tannin is found in the bark and seed pods. =Wood= The wood is fairly hard and it is used for furniture, handles for implements and tools for grinding grain manually. The wood of V. sieberiana has a density of about 655 kg/m¬≥. Ecology and conservation This tree is widespread in its natural habitat and is not threatened. It is browsed upon by livestock and game such as elephant and giraffe.

He competed in Canadian and international wrestling promotions including the eastern Canadian Grand Prix Wrestling, the Calgary-based Stampede Wrestling, New Japan Pro Wrestling in Japan and World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico. Professional wrestling career Born in Bayam√≥n, Puerto Rico, Ayala was a fan of professional wrestling and admired Huracan Castillo. During the early-1970s, he traveled to the United States several months after his mother had left to live with her daughter and her grandchildren in Boston, Massachusetts. While living in Boston, Cruz met former National Wrestling Alliance wrestler Angelo Savoldi working out at a local gym. After undergoing training with Savoldi, he was able to compete for the then World Wide Wrestling Federation for a brief time.

In these methods the material itself is used as a form of strain gauge. The various methods are derived from powder diffraction but look for the small shifts in the diffraction spectrum that indicate a change a lattice parameter instead of trying to derive unknown structural information. By comparing the lattice parameter to a known reference value it is possible to determine the. If sufficient measurements are made in different directions it is possible to derive the strain tensor. If the elastic properties of the material are known, one can then compute the stress tensor. Principles At its most basic level strain scanning uses shifts in Bragg diffraction peaks to determine the strain. Strain is defined as the change in length (shift in lattice parameter, d) divided by the original length (unstrained lattice parameter, d0). In diffraction based strain scanning this becomes the change in peak position divided by the original position. The precise equation is presented in terms of diffraction angle, energy, or - for relatively slow moving neutrons - time of flight: :\\\\epsilon = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta d}{d_0} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta \\\\theta}{\\\\theta_0} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta E}{E_0} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta t}{t_0} \\\\, Methods The details of the technique are heavily influenced by the type of radiation used since lab X-rays, synchrotron X-rays and neutrons have very different properties.

Branson predicted the company would sell 24,000 cars in the first year, with an ¬£300m turnover. By October 2000, the company had sold over 2,000 cars, generating ¬£30 million. In July 2001, the company started a subsidiary, Virgin Bikes. By 2003, the company only managed to sell 12,000 cars in total. On 23 May 2003, Branson opened Virgin Cars' first showroom in Salford, Greater Manchester. It was located at the end of the M602 motorway, near the A6/A57. On 22 December 2005, the company stopped all operations and trading. The building which it occupied, was stripped of all branding.

Background and recording The band recorded Boxer with producer Peter Katis, with vocalist Matt Berninger stating, \\"We recorded a lot of it at home. Probably half and half of home recording and recording with Peter in the studio. We always kind of work that way, going in and out of studios and then back home. We have little home set-ups.

Regarding his recording contributions, Berninger noted, \\"Bryce has played a lot with [Sufjan‚Äôs] touring band, so Bryce knows him really well. And [Sufjan] lives in the same neighborhood that Bryce and Aaron live in. They just called him and he came over for a day. It was a one-day collaboration. Him, Bryce and Aaron hang out a lot and make little songs together, so it was really a kind of casual type of collaboration.\\" Writing and composition The track \\"Slow Show\\" contains lyrics from the band's song \\"29 Years,\\" which previously appeared on their self-titled debut album.

North Franklin, at , is the highest point in El Paso, and the 27th-highest mountain in the state of Texas.Texas Highest Named Summits Surrounded by a state park and with a maintained trail leading to its summit, the mountain is a popular hiking destination. North Franklin is located entirely within the city of El Paso, approximately east of the Texas‚ÄìNew Mexico border and north of the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border. The mountain is the highest of the Franklins, clipping nearby Anthony's Nose by just over and neighboring South Franklin by nearly . North Franklin rises above both its western base in the Mesilla Valley and its eastern base in the Hueco Bolson. In spite of its name, North Franklin is actually in the central Franklins, being the northernmost of the range's two key peaks (South Franklin, of course, is the other). To the south of these, the South Franklins include the peaks Mount Franklin and Ranger Peak (all of the television broadcast towers for El Paso are in the Southern Franklins). Like most of the Franklins, North Franklin Mountain is visible from many miles away. When observed from the east or west, North Franklin is shaped like a scalene triangle, with its long side facing its dome-shaped sister peak South Franklin Mountain. This quality makes it a valuable navigation point when traversing the desert areas around El Paso.  Geology  The Franklin Mountains are tilted-block fault mountains composed of sedimentary rocks, some of which date back to Precambrian times and are among the oldest in Texas. The mountains are the southernmost extent of the Laramide orogeny, which occurred 60-70 million years ago. The Precambrian rocks atop North Franklin Mountain represent \\"the highest geological structure in the state of Texas.\\" North Franklin gets its reddish color from the unusually high levels of oxidized iron in the volcanic rocks coating its summit and higher slopes.  History  Residence Section and Mt. Franklin, El Paso, Texas, c. 1912 For centuries, Native Americans and other travellers have used the vegetation and wildlife in the Franklins when crossing the Paso del Norte‚Äîthe gap between the Franklin Mountains and the Juarez Mountains that is now the site of Ciudad Ju√°rez and El Paso. Pictographs and mortar pits attest to a human presence in the mountains dating back more than 12,000 years.Franklin Mountains State Park. Texas Parks and Wildlife Division Website. Retrieved: 1 April 2007. The Franklin Mountains are probably named after Benjamin Franklin Coons, who in 1849 purchased a ranch in what is now the El Paso area. Initially known as Coons Ranch, by 1851 the settlement had apparently taken Coons' middle name and was called \\"Franklin\\".W.H. Timmons, El Paso: A Borderlands History (El Paso: Texas Western Press/UTEP, 1990), 111. Despite the town being officially named El Paso in 1852, the locals continued to call it Franklin throughout the 1850s.W.H. Timmons, El Paso: A Borderlands History (El Paso: Texas Western Press/UTEP, 1990), 112. The El Paso Tin Mining and Smelting Company operated a tin mine on the northeast slope of North Franklin from 1909‚Äì1915. While the mine had the distinction of being the only tin mine ever located in the U.S., the venture was an economic failure. Today, a trail leading to the ruins of the mine forks off the North Franklin Peak Trail, just east of Mundy's Gap.Robert Miles, \\"Franklin Mountains.\\" The Handbook of Texas Online. Retrieved: 1 April 2007.  Access  Looking north from the summit of North Franklin Mountain; Anthony's Nose is below, and the Organ Mountains are in distance The trailhead is in the Tom Mays Unit (not the park headquarters in McKelligon Canyon) of the Franklin Mountains State Park near the summit of Texas State Highway Loop 375. The Mundy's Gap Trail rises out of the Tom Mays section and winds to Mundy's Gap, on the north slope of North Franklin Mountain. From Mundy's Gap, the North Franklin Peak Trail follows the mountain's eastern slope for approximately three miles to the summit. Various spur trails branch off the main trail along the way. The summit of North Franklin has been flattened out, with an area equal to the size of a small parking lot. The only man-made structure at the summit is a ham radio repeater and ELT receiver maintained by the West Texas Repeater Association. On a typical day, the Organ Mountains of New Mexico can be seen along the horizon to the north. To the east, the Guadalupe Mountains rise some in the distance. Most of the Mesilla Valley is visible to the west, including parts of El Paso and Ciudad Ju√°rez, and most of the town of Anthony. South Franklin Mountain and the Juarez Mountains are to the south. Anthony's Nose, the second highest peak, can be accessed from Tom Mays park by an unofficial trail originating from the C5 campsite (parking is at the same place as for the Aztec Cave trail). From the C5 campsite, the trail gradually winds uphill to the left, then goes directly up to the ridgeline across a narrow rocky pass. The trail then follows the ridgeline northward about 2 miles directly to Anthony's Nose. Although no technical gear is needed, there are a couple of difficult climbing areas along the way and the entire round trip takes about 10 hours. Once again, it is not an official trail, so it is not as well-maintained as other trails in the park.

He was assistant conductor and chorus master for a production of Mr Pepys at the Everyman Theatre, Hampstead, and for other theatrical shows. Adrian Boult invited him to assist with an opera season in Bristol which Austin assumed the lead when Boult was obliged to go to Egypt, and was then asked to be conductor of the small professional Glen Pavilion orchestra in the city with whom he made his first broadcast on the BBC. In 1929, he became Conductor for three years with the Carl Rosa Opera Company touring throughout Great Britain, and then worked briefly with the short-lived Metropolitan Opera Company in 1933.

In 1935 he married the 'cellist Leily Howell whom he had met when she played a concerto with the Bournemouth orchestra. During his years on the south coast Austin was expected to conduct three concerts per week in the winter and more in summer; requiring him to greatly expand his repertoire. For the annual festival Austin continued the tradition of Godfrey in inviting eminent musicians to take part, these included Thomas Beecham, Henry Wood, Hamilton Harty and Igor Stravinsky. He resigned from the Municipal Orchestra when Bournemouth Corporation cut the complement to only 24 players.

History  The Canadian laker James Carruthers on Lake Huron in 1913. An informal merchant navy appeared in 1914 at the start of World War I and was renamed Canadian Government Merchant Marine in 1918, but slowly disappeared by 1930. Within hours of Canada's declaration of war on 10 September 1939, the Canadian government passed laws to create the Canadian Merchant Navy setting out rules and controls to provide a workforce for wartime shipping. The World War II Merchant Navy greatly expanded the similar World War I effort. The Canadian Merchant Navy played a major role in the Battle of the Atlantic bolstering the Allies' merchant fleet due to high losses in the British Merchant Navy. Eventually thousands of Canadians served aboard hundreds of Canadian Merchant Navy ships, notably the \\"Park ships\\", the Canadian equivalent of the American \\"Liberty ships\\". Rear Admiral Leonard W. Murray reported, > The Battle of the Atlantic was not won by any Navy or any Air Force, it was > won by the courage, fortitude and determination of the British and Allied > Merchant Navy.Notes prepared by Admiral Murray for CBC interview in 1967, > Library and Archives of Canada, Admiral Murray papers, Collection MG30 E207 A school was established at St. Margaret's Bay, Nova Scotia to train sailors for the Canadian Merchant Navy, who became known as \\"Merchant Mariners.\\" Manning pools, or barracks, were built in major Canadian ports to house Merchant Mariners. The Merchant Navy was considered a fourth branch of the Canadian military alongside the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and the Royal Canadian Air Force, and suffered the highest casualty rate of the four. After the war, Canadian Merchant Navy veterans were denied veterans benefits and official recognition for decades. This was not corrected until the 1990s and many individual cases remain unresolved. An important gesture in 2003 was the designation by the Canadian Parliament of the Merchant Navy Remembrance Day on 3 September as a day to recognize the contributions and sacrifice of Canadian Merchant Mariners. The Merchant Navy slowly disappeared until by 1950 no Merchant Navy ships were left. Crew Merchant Navy ships were armed during World War II. There were merchant seamen gunners. Also many British and Canadian merchantmen carried volunteer naval gunners called defensively equipped merchant ship or DEMS gunners. Merchant seamen crewed the merchant ships of the British Merchant Navy which kept the United Kingdom supplied with raw materials, arms, ammunition, fuel, food and all of the necessities of a nation at war throughout World War II. Seamen were aged from fourteen through to their late seventies.Commonwealth War Graves Commission records Memorials Andr√© Gauthier in Spencer Smith Park Plaque in Halifax, Nova Scotia commemorating the contribution of the merchant marine during the World Wars Engraving of SS Point Pleasant Park, Canadian Merchant Navy Monument, Sackville Landing, Halifax, Nova Scotia * \\"Royal Canadian Naval Association Naval Memorial (1995)\\" by Andr√© Gauthier was erected on the shore of Lake Ontario in Spencer Smith Park in Burlington, Ontario.

During two world wars the main duty of the Royal Canadian Navy was to escort convoys in the Atlantic and guard merchant vessels against the threat of attack by German submarines. In the Second World War, it also escorted ships in the Mediterranean and to Russia and supported the Allied landings in Sicilian, Italian and Normandy campaigns as well as in the Pacific.

It saw service for three centuries including the First and Second World Wars. The regiment survived the immediate post-war reduction in forces, and went on to distinguish itself in the battles of the Korean War, but was recommended for amalgamation in the 1957 Defence White Paper prepared by Duncan Sandys. The regiment was amalgamated with the 4th Queen's Own Hussars, to form the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars in 1958. History= Formation and War of Spanish Succession= The regiment was first raised by Henry Conyngham as Henry Conyngham's Regiment of Dragoons in Derry in 1693, and ranked as the 8th Dragoons. They soldiered at home as part of the Irish Establishment A Military Dictionary, William Duane. 1810 p 140 but were deployed to Spain in 1704 to take part in the War of the Spanish Succession. The regiment took part in a skirmish near Tanarite at which Henry Conyngham was killed: Robert Killigrew took over but was also killed at the Battle of Almansa in April 1707. Under their new colonel, John Pepper, the 8th Dragoons routed a Spanish cavalry regiment at the Battle of Almenar in July 1710, and, according to tradition, took possession of the enemy regiment's crossbelts. This earned the regiment the nickname \\"Crossbelt Dragoons\\", borne for many years. The regiment was captured in its entirety at the Battle of Brihuega in December 1710. =Disbandment and reformation (1713‚Äì1796)= The regiment returned home and was disbanded in 1714. It was re-raised again in 1715 and deployed to Scotland as part of the response to the Jacobite rising of 1715 and again for the Jacobite rising of 1745. The regiment then moved back to Ireland, where, in 1751, they were formally titled as the 8th Regiment of Dragoons and numbered for the first time as the 8th Dragoons. In 1775 they received their first title, \\"The 8th King's Royal Irish Light Dragoons\\". The regiment was renamed in 1777 for King George III as the 8th (The King's Royal Irish) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons. The regiment was deployed to the Low Countries in 1794 for service in the Flanders Campaign and took part in a skirmish at Bousbecque where they captured the French guns. After being directed by King George III to wear buff accoutrements as an honour, the regiment returned to England in November 1795. =South Africa, India and peace (1796‚Äì1854)= The regiment deployed to South Africa to control the Boers in 1796, then transferred to North Africa and went on to India in 1802 to put down the activities of Daulat Scindia and Yashwantrao Holkar. It fought at the Battle of Laswari in November 1803; Scindia was defeated and Holkar submitted after 3,000 of his men died at Farakhabad in 1805; a peace treaty was signed in January 1806. The regiment then stormed two fortresses belonging to the rebellious Pindaris in September 1812. In 1814, the regiment then took on the Gurkhas, who were seeking to extend the boundaries of Nepal; Colonel Rollo Gillespie was killed in an action at Kalunga: his horse, Black Bob, became a regimental mascot. In 1818, the colonel of the regiment, Sir Banastre Tarleton, received orders that the regiment was to convert to a hussar regiment, retitled the 8th (The King's Royal Irish) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons (Hussars) The regiment returned to England in 1819. The regiment escorted Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on their first visit to Dublin in 1849. =Crimean War= 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars (1850) Robert Richard Scanlan During the Crimean War, the regiment formed part of the Light Brigade. The regiment set sail from Plymouth in early March 1854. Five ships were needed to transport them to the Black Sea. The Echunga, Mary Anne and the Shooting Star left first, followed by the Medora and the Wilson Kennedy on 1 May. The next battle was near the River Alma in September 1854 and the 8th Hussars were awarded the battle honour for a convincing defeat of the enemy. On 28 September, following a report that Russian troops were out in front of Balaklava town, the troop of the 8th, which made up Lord Raglan's escort under Captain Chetwode, was thrown out in skirmishing order. The Horse Artillery then came up and opened fire, causing the Russians to abandon all their wagons and flee from the scene. Some 70 wagons and carts were captured, some only containing small arms ammunition, which was destroyed. The rest of the wagons contained black bread. The troops were allowed to pillage the wagons that did not contain anything of value to the Commissariat. As a result, within a few minutes, the ground was strewn with various pieces of clothing ‚Äì Hussar uniforms, fur cloaks, and wigs. The carriages were said to belong to the suite of Prince Menshikov. After this engagement until 25 October, the regiment furnished patrols and outpost duties, being billeted close to vineyards and barns containing water, corn, hay and fuel. The charge of the Light Brigade, October 1854; The 8th Hussars were in the third line of cavalry (on the right of the picture) In October, Balaklava and the Charge of the Light Brigade took place. It was started when 25,000 Russians tried to capture Balaklava, the British Army's only port, defended by the 93rd Highlanders, some Turks, and the Cavalry Division. Lieutenant Colonel Sherwell led the King's Royal Irish Hussars, forbidding two soldiers to carry their swords in the charge because they had \\"Disgraced the regiment by smoking in the presence of the enemy\\". The charge through the crossfire into the mouths of the Russian guns is vividly described by Lieutenant the Hon S Calthorpe, an 8th Hussar ADC. > The pace of our Cavalry increased every moment, until they went thundering > along the valley, making the ground tremble beneath them. On they went > headlong to death, disregarding aught but the object of their attack. At > length they arrived at the guns, their numbers sadly thinned, but the few > that remained made fearful havoc amongst the enemy's artillery. The Charge of the Light Brigade by Richard Caton Woodville As part of the second wave of the brigade's attack, the 8th were in line with the 4th Light Dragoons and, advancing in support at a steady pace, came under fire. Wounded men and horses from the leading squadrons kept dashing out, making the lines unsteady. With the pace increasing, the 4th were not checked by their officers and the lines separated. In spite of the fall of men and horses, the regiment passed the remains of the battery in the valley. The 8th pushed through the line of Russian gunners to the remnants of the first line in retreat, unaware that a Russian brigade of light cavalry was at hand. A regiment of Russian lancers was advancing from behind, as the 8th Hussars went through the infantry crossfire and lost half their men. The remnants of the brigade formed up, totalling about 70 men. They decided to attack the Russian lancers, eventually overthrowing them. The ground was now opened up for the brigade to retire, the 8th now pursued their course to their original position, followed by all the other horsemen of the other regiments and, as their horses became blown or wounded, they tailed. The Russians were now recovering in confidence and they pursued the dismounted men. The officers of the 8th called off the men, freeing up the ground for artillery fire, which gave many the chance to escape. Overall, two officers and 19 other ranks were killed and two officers and 18 other ranks were wounded. One officer and seven other ranks were taken prisoner-of-war. The Battle of Inkerman was won by the infantry in November as the harsh winter of 1854‚Äì55 set in, killing 9,000 men. However, the loss of these men did not stop the 8th Hussars from overcoming the Russians at Kertch. In September 1855, Sevastopol fell after nearly a year, and a peace treaty was signed in March 1856. Of the 293 other ranks who had set out for the Crimea with the regiment, two were promoted to officer rank, 42 were invalided, 68 died of wounds or disease, 26 were killed in action or died immediately afterward. One private deserted to the Russians and 154 returned with the regiment to England, including 65 who had been to the Danube. Of the 230 troop horses that had set out for the Crimea with the regiment, only 30 were brought home, including 13 that had been to the Danube. =Indian Rebellion of 1857= Lakshmibai, Rani of Jhansi who was killed by a soldier of the 8th Hussars The 8th spent a year in England but were called to India to help suppress the Indian rebellion of 1857 and were ready for war in February 1858. The most celebrated action of the war came three months later at Gwalior when a squadron of the 8th, under Captain Heneage fought a large Indian force under Rani Lakshmibai trying to leave the area. The 8th Hussars charged into the enemy, killing swathes of Indian soldiers, taking two guns and continuing the charge right through the Phul Bagh encampment. Rani Lakshmibai, the Queen of Jhansi state, dressed as a cavalry leader, was badly wounded. She did not want the British to capture her body, so she told a hermit to burn her body. General Sir Hugh Rose awarded the squadron four Victoria Crosses under Clause 13 of the Victoria Cross warrant.Original Warrant, Clause 13: \\"Thirteenthly. It is ordained that in the event of a gallant and daring act having been performed by a squadron, ship's company, or detached body of seamen and marines not under 50 in number, or by a brigade, regiment, troop or company in which the admiral, general, or other officer commanding such forces may deem that all are equally brave and distinguished, and that no special selection can be made by them, then is such case the admiral, general, or other officer commanding, may direct that for any such body of seamen or marines, or for every troop or company of soldiers, one officer shall be selected by the officers engaged for the Decoration, and in like manner one petty officer or non-commissioned officer shall be selected by the petty officers and non- commissioned officers engaged, and two seamen or private soldiers or marines shall be selected by the seamen, or private soldiers, or marines engaged, respectively for the Decoration, and the names of those selected shall be transmitted by the senior officers in command of the Naval force, brigade, regiment, troop, or company, to the admiral or general officer commanding, who shall in due manner confer the Decoration as if the acts were done under his own eye.\\" From This meant that one officer, one NCO, and two for the Corporals and troopers, all to be elected by their comrades. Captain C W Heneage, Sergeant J Ward, Farrier G Hollis and Private J Pearson were chosen to be recipients. The citation was published in the London Gazette of 28 January 1859, and read: The remaining year of the Mutiny consisted of the pursuit of the rebel forces. On 5 September 1858, a squadron of \\"D\\" Troop, 8th Hussars, caught the mutineers at Beejapore, inflicting heavy losses. Of the 850 enemy troops, no less than 450 bodies were counted dead on the field. On 8 September 1858, at Beejapore, when both the officers attached to the troop were disabled, Troop Sergeant-Major James Champion, although severely wounded himself at the start of the action, continued to do his duty and wounded several of the enemy. For this action, he too was awarded the Victoria Cross. From then on, until 21 May 1859, when the Headquarters Troop reached Nusserabad, all troops had been in search of the rebels. In its time in India, the 8th had gone through two hot-weather campaigns, H.Q. Troop had shifted camp 300 times and marched over 3000 miles with some of the other Troops marching close to 4000 miles. Reaching Meerut in February 1861, there was an epidemic of cholera in which the regiment lost two officers and thirty-one men. The title of the regiment was simplified in 1861 to the 8th (The King's Royal Irish) Hussars. In 1994, a man watching racehorses being trained on the Curragh in County Kildare, Ireland, glimpsed a small piece of metal being thrown up with mud by a horse galloping by; this turned out to be a Victoria Cross (minus its bar). It was presumed to have been one of the four awarded to the 8th Hussars, as they were based at the Curragh between 1869 and 1875 and until 1881 soldiers were required to wear all their medals while on duty. At the time, it was thought likely to have belonged to either George Hollis or John Pearson as the other two medals were accounted for; Pearson's collection of medals, including his VC, were subsequently sold at auction in 2004.Niall Fallon, 'A rare medal is unearthed on Curragh' in The Irish Times, 21 May 1994, p.22 =Peace and Second Boer War (1863‚Äì1914)= General De Salis, a veteran of the Crimean campaign and sometime Colonel of the Regiment. 8th Hussars Boer War memorial in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin The regiment returned to India in 1879 and then moved on to Afghanistan to bolster Lord Roberts' army, which was engaged in the Second Anglo-Afghan War; the regiment returned home in 1889. In October 1899, war broke out between the United Kingdom and the Boer republics in South Africa. The regiment sailed to South Africa on the SS Norseman in February 1900, arriving in Cape Town early the next month. Along with the 7th Dragoon Guards and the 14th Hussars they formed the 4th Cavalry Brigade under Brigadier General Dickson. On 1 May 1900, the Boers made a stand in a strong position at Houtnek, where the forces of Ian Hamilton faced stiff competition. In a telegram of 2 May Lord Roberts said: \\"Hamilton speaks in high terms of the services of the 8th Hussars under Colonel Clowes and a made-up regiment of Lancers, which came into Broadwood's brigade and assisted in making the Boers evacuate their position\\". The 8th then marched from Machadodorp to Heidelberg with the 14th Hussars and M Battery, under the command of Colonel Mahon. On 13 October, Mahon \\"became heavily engaged near Geluk with a body of 1100 men with four guns.\\" Mahon succeeded in holding his position until the French came to his assistance when the Boers were driven back in a south-easterly direction, having sustained some losses. The 8th lost 2 officers, Lieutenants P A T Jones and F H Wylam and 7 men, with 2 officers and 8 men wounded. Eight officers and 8 non- commissioned officers were mentioned in Lord Roberts' final despatches of 2 April and 4 September 1901. In the first three months of 1901, the 8th was in the column of Colonel Charles Edmond Knox, at one point sweeping to the Swazi border. During the later phases of the war, the Eastern Transvaal to the borders of Zululand were the principal scenes of the regiment's operations. One officer and 1 non-commissioned officer were mentioned by Lord Kitchener during the war, and in the final despatch, the names of 4 officers, 2 non- commissioned officers, and 1 private were added. Colonel Le Gallais of the 8th Hussars had done splendid service as a leader of Mounted Infantry, and he fell on 6 November 1900 after he had inflicted a defeat on De Wet at Bothaville. Colonel Mahon, also an old 8th Hussar, was celebrated for his conduct of the Mafeking Relief column. After returning to England, the 8th had over six years without hostilities before returning to India in August 1914 arriving at Ambala as part of the 3rd (Ambala) Cavalry Brigade. They remained in India for three months until they were recalled due to the outbreak of the First World War. They arrived in Marseilles on 10 November 1914 where they joined the 1st Indian Cavalry Division. =First World War= Trench warfare meant that the cavalry were held in reserve, waiting for \\"the gap\\" The 8th Hussars entered the trenches on the Western Front for the first time on 9 December 1914, not having arrived in time to take any part in the Retreat from Mons. The first action that the 8th encountered was in December 1914 at the Battle of Givenchy. The majority of their time was spent sending large parties forward to dig trenches and this continued for the whole of the war. In May 1915, they took part in the Second battle of Ypres where the Germans first used chlorine gas. In September 1915 the 8th Hussars transferred to the 2nd Indian Cavalry Division. Maxim machine guns captured at Villiers Faucon The majority of the casualties occurred from the unsanitary conditions of the trenches, the cavalry being held almost exclusively in reserve, waiting for \\"the gap\\" constantly warned off, but never used. In July 1916, the King's Royal Irish Hussars fought at Bazentin, then Flers-Courcelette the following month, both battles being in the Somme area. They returned to the Somme area in March 1917 to clear the small pockets of machine guns left by the retreating Germans. They took part in what would be the Regiment's last mounted charge at Villers- Faucon when B and D Squadrons, supported by a howitzer battery and two armoured cars, attacked a heavily defended German position. B Squadron charged, then attacked on foot (the armoured cars were quickly put out of action) and drew the enemy's fire. D Squadron charged and captured the village with few casualties. The Squadron Commander, Major Van der Byl, was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for the action. Two Maxim machine guns were captured in this action and have been used as guardroom adornments by the 8th Hussars and successor regiments since 1918. During the German spring offensive of 1918, \\"C\\" Squadron under Captain Adlercron, defended the village of Hervilly until being forced to retreat, only to recapture it later that day at the loss of 66 casualties. Regimental Memorial on display at Athlone Barracks, Sennelager In March 1918, they were transferred to the 9th Cavalry Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division. On 11 March, they came on the British War Establishment i.e. D squadron was absorbed into the others. The Germans began to collapse soon after the allies began their final offensive in August, the 8th fighting at St Quentin, Beaurevoir and Cambrai and the Pursuit to Mons. On 11 November 1918, whilst camped at Maffles, the regiment heard that the Armistice had been signed. The 8th Hussars had 105 soldiers killed and countless wounded throughout the four years of the war. The regiment commissioned a memorial to the fallen, which has been on display, where possible, since its unveiling and has been updated with the names of those who fell in the Second World War and the Korean War and is now on display with the successor regiment, the Queen's Royal Hussars. =Inter-war= The 8th Hussars returned to England in 1919, and embarked almost immediately for India where they spent less than a year. They were soon ordered to Mesopotamia in order to deal with various native insurrections at Medali, which they put down, moving from there to Egypt. The regiment retitled as the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars in 1921. In 1923, the Regiment moved back to York and completed a three-year tour as part of the occupation forces in Germany from 1926‚Äì1929. They then returned to Aldershot, and received their first motorised transport for the machine-gun squadron. In 1934, the 8th moved to Abassia in Egypt. Their particular brand of soldiering was at an end after 242 years; the King's Royal Irish Hussars had their horses replaced with 15 Cwt Ford V8 pick-up trucks mounted with Vickers Berthier machine guns. The last mounted parade was held at Coombe Hill in the desert near Cairo on 11 November 1935 where the three sabre squadrons and the mounted band \\"trotted past, wheeled and galloped\\" for the GOC, Army of the Nile. In 1936, the regiment helped quell civil unrest in Palestine and then returned to Egypt as part of the Matruh Mobile Force. =Second World War=The Desert War Stuart tanks of the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars in North Africa, August 1941. In 1938, the regiment was transferred to the Light Cavalry Brigade of the Mobile Division, (The Matruh Mobile Force) which later became the 7th Armoured Division, nicknamed The Desert Rats. Light tanks were issued in January 1939 as the regiment transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps. These were cast-offs from the 7th Hussars and the band was converted to an Anti-Tank Troop in 15 Cwt trucks (Portees). Transfer from Cavalry of the Line to the Royal Armoured Corps came in May 1939 as the regiment prepared for war after the Italian invasion of Albania. For the first time, black berets were worn as working dress instead of the traditional cavalry \\"side-hat\\". In August 1939, the regiment was sent into the desert to prepare positions at the Mersa Matruh Line. As part of the preparations, petrol dumps were created by burying supplies in the sand with a piece of wood indicating the burial site and marking the position on maps. The regiment was part of the offensive against the Italian Army in North Africa in June 1940, nine months after the outbreak of the Second World War. Sidi Omar was captured immediately and Fort Capuzzo three days later, followed by Fort Maddalena. On 22 October, supporting the 2nd Battalion, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders an attack was made against Maktila. Other actions took place as part of the campaign against Italian forces including the battle at Sidi Barrani where 14,000 prisoners were captured and the action at Bardia. On 5 January 1941, the regiment captured and occupied El Adem airfield and by 8 January 1942 were part of the forces surrounding Tobruk. In February 1941, they were involved in the decisive Battle of Beda Fomm, which led to the capture of most of the Italian forces in North Africa at the time. In March 1941, the 8th Hussars saw brief service in Greece before returning to North Africa as part of the 1st Armoured Division. The regiment then returned to refit at Mena, Cairo in time for St Patrick's Day. Grant tank. In July 1941, the 8th Hussars, in Stuart tanks, were part of the 4th Armoured Brigade for Operation Crusader. During the three-day Battle of Sidi Rezegh Airfield, the regiment had formed a box leaguer for the night-time lull in fighting with the rest of the brigade on 22 November (as neither side had night vision aids, battle normally ceased at dusk). The leaguer was discovered by the 15th Panzer Division during the night and in the ensuing engagement left the Irish Hussars with just four Stuart tanks fit for battle; 35 having been captured or destroyed. The regiment was issued 32 new Stuarts at Cairo and, under the command of Major Sandbach the regiment returned to the battle. On 1 December, to assist ANZAC forces, the regiment charged \\"cavalry style\\" again at Sidi Rezegh and although the action was successful, Major Sandbach was killed. Command then fell to Major Phillips. After a re-fit and influx of recruits at Beni Yusef, the 8th Hussars were temporarily converted to armoured cars but before seeing action in them were issued with new tanks. A & B Squadrons with the Grant and C Squadron in Stuarts, all under the command of Lt Col Gerald \\"Smash\\" Kilkelly.Unit histories‚ÄîLt Col Gerald \\"Smash\\" Kilkelly Once again part of the 4th Armoured Brigade with which it served during the Gazala battles of May and June 1942, suffering heavy losses at the Battle of Knightsbridge in which Major Hackett was severely burnt and Colonel Kilkelly captured, and also battles at Bardia and Bir Hacheim. The 8th fought hard as a composite unit with the 4th City of London Yeomanry (casualties having reduced the size of both regiments) before having to withdraw with the rest of the British Eighth Army to El Alamein. In June, the remnants of the regiment under command of Lieutenant Colonel \\"Cuthie\\" Goulbourn detached one squadron to their future partners, the 4th Queen's Own Hussars, to form a temporary regiment called the 4th/8th Hussars. The brigade, including the 8th and the 4th/8th faced the massive enemy onslaught at Alam Halfa, defeating the enemy. They helped breach the minefields at the Second Battle of El Alamein and then joined the pursuit for three weeks. The regiment then enjoyed a short tour in Cyprus before returning to England. Normandy and beyond Cromwell tank Chaffee tank Sherman Firefly ‚Äì Hamburg 1945 Officers of the 8th Hussars wearing the distinctive Tent Hat unique to the regiment(1944) On its return from North Africa, the regiment was re-equipped with Cromwell tanks and retrained at West Tofts Camp near Thetford in Norfolk. In November 1943, the regiment became the Armoured Reconnaissance regiment of the 7th Armoured Division. On 9 June 1944, they were aboard a convoy leaving Bumper Quay in Gosport at 11am, bound for the Normandy beaches. Having been delayed several days by bad weather, they landed at Le Hamel on Gold Beach and leaguered up at Sommervieu near Bayeux. Going into action almost immediately they began taking casualties at Granville Crossroads, Livry in the fighting around Villers-Bocage. From 11‚Äì30 June, the 8th were involved in the advance through the Bocage with the 22nd Armoured Brigade. They were involved in action against the 2nd Panzer Division, with the 8th leading their division out of the bridgehead. On 30 June, they handed over their positions to tanks from the US 2nd Armored Division and withdrew for a rest and a refit of the tanks. They also fought heavily around Briquessard and took a full part in Operation Goodwood and a number of other smaller engagements. The 8th pushed German forces further and further back, taking part in the actions to close the Falaise pocket suffering more casualties of men and tanks. Reinforced by a squadron from the Northamptonshire Yeomanry, they pushed back through France, the break-out into the low countries, crossing the border into Belgium on 11 September 1944 and into the Netherlands on 23 September, taking up positions at Sint Oedenrode and finally to the Rhine, fighting hard on the way at St Pol, the Nederrijn and the Maas. After wintering in the Maas and spending some time employed as infantry in support of the Rifle Brigade during the latter half of 1944, the regiment painted its vehicles white (including the recently acquired Sherman Firefly versions with their effective 17 pdr guns and the Chaffee recce tanks) and prepared to support the counterattack against the German offensive in the Ardennes. In the event, this did not occur and the Irish Hussars continued their advance across the Netherlands dealing with resistance when they came across it. Colonel Gouldburn moved on at this juncture and was replaced by Lt Col Desmond Fitzpatrick of the Royal Dragoons with Major Wingate Charlton DSC (formerly with \\"Glubb\\" Pasha in the Arab Legion)as second in command. In April 1945, the 8th crossed Weser River liberating the POW camp at FallingbostelFallingbostel Military Museum before ending the war close to Hamburg. The regiment then went to Berlin on 7 July 1945 to take part in the Victory celebrations ‚Äì the 2nd senior British Army regiment on parade. The regiment stayed in Itzehoe, Germany, for a year, before moving to the Dutch border to help with internal security and occupation duties. =Korean War= Centurion Tank Centurion tank of the 8th Hussars at Battle of Imjin. In 1948, the 8th returned to Leicestershire, transferring to Tidworth Camp as part of the Strategic Reserve in 1950 but when the Korean War broke out they were sent out as part of the 29th Independent Brigade under the command of Lt Col William Lowther OBE (Bart). Having trained flat-out to become familiar with Centurion MkIII tanks they sailed from Southampton to Korea on the HMT Empire Fowey on 11 October 1950, docking in Pusan on 14 November. Having reached the front, north of Pyongyang, all squadrons found themselves in full retreat, regrouping on the Han River. Early in 1951, Recce Troop saw action on the Han River in an area known as \\"Compo Valley\\" and had twenty three soldiers killed or missing. During this action, a Cromwell tank was captured by the Chinese and had to be knocked out several days later by fire from the Hussars own Centurions. Captain Donald Lewis Astley-Cooper, who was in command of Recce Troop, then put together a scratch force known as \\"Cooper Force\\" of Cromwell tanks borrowed from 7 RTR, which assisted the hard-pressed Royal Ulster Rifles, who had been under attack by superior forces since 2 January.Captain Donald Lewis Astley-Cooper: Mosley, Charles, editor. Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes. Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003. Astley-Cooper was last seen dismounting his brewed up Cromwell and running away with his loader. His subsequent fate is unknown. In February, the United Nations Forces took the offensive, helping the Glosters capture Hill 327. By April 1951, patrols were probing north of the Imjin River seemingly uncontested until a massive enemy assault started the Battle of the Imjin River on 22 April 1951. During the lull, it had been decided to rotate the 8th back to the United Kingdom. A & B Squadrons along with RHQ had already reached Kure in Japan when the Chinese Spring Offensive had broken out and were immediately ordered back to Korea. C Squadron, commanded initially by the one-eyed veteran Captain Peter Ormrod and then by Major Henry Huth (flown in from Japan) was left to undertake the taskings given to the Hussars alone. The troops of tanks commanded by Capt Ormrod, Capt Murray, Lt Boyall, Lt John Hurst and Lt Radford engaged the attacking Chinese over several days to try to prevent the loss of the important high features defended by the Glosters, the Northumberland Fusiliers and the Royal Ulster Rifles. The 8th were forced to make several sorties into overrun positions to rescue infantrymen cut off by the advancing Chinese infantry. The fighting was fierce: Richard Napier, (a tank commander in the battle) in his book From Horses to Chieftains recalls: \\"After about three hours of continuous firing, my machine gun barrels needed changing; my recoil system was so hot that it wouldn't run back and my loader/operator Ken Hall, had fainted with the continual hard work and fumes.\\" Napier relates how, unable to use his weapons, he withdrew, allowing infantrymen to hitch a ride on his tank. The Chinese had infiltrated behind them and were swarming around them, shooting at the infantrymen on the tank. The crew resorted to lobbing grenades out of the hatches at the mass of Chinese infantry. On one occasion, the Centurion tanks of the 8th were swamped by Chinese soldiers who were attempting to prise open the hatches to throw grenades inside. The response of the Irish Hussars was to turn the turrets of their tanks towards each other, and \\"hose\\" the enemy off with their Besa machine guns. On their return to the British Lines, it was said that these tanks \\"ran red with the blood of dead Chinese.\\" Human detritus was also caught up in the tracks as the tanks had run over a number of Chinese and (unfortunately) some British dead. With the final withdrawal of C Squadron, the battle was over, the last shots being fired by Major Huth. C Squadron them split into two components, one under Major Huth supporting the Northumberland Fusiliers with one troop detached to the Glosters, the other under Capt Strachan in support of the Royal Ulster Rifles. They held their positions for two days in anticipation of further Chinese attacks, which did not come, before withdrawing to Seoul. Major Henry Huth received the DSO for his part in the Imjin battles and Captain Peter Ormrod won the Military Cross. \\"It was at the Battle of the Imjin River in April 1951 that the Centurions of the 8th Hussars won lasting fame when their tanks covered the withdrawal of the 29th Brigade in heroic fashion in the face of the overwhelming Chinese Spring Offensive\\". =Amalgamation= Prince Philip takes the salute on Amalgamation Day Between 1952 and 1958 the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars soldiered in L√ºneburg enjoying an extended period of peace. In the 1957 Defence White Paper, the 8th Hussars were slated for reduction. In 1958, the Regiment was amalgamated with the 4th Queen's Own Hussars to form the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars. Regimental museum The regimental collection is moving to a new facility in Warwick known as \\"Trinity Mews\\": it is due to open in 2018. Battle honours The 8th Hussars received a number of battle honours throughout its existence. As per tradition only 40 of these honours were emblazoned on the Regimental Guidon. The battle honour of Hindoostan was awarded in 1825 for services throughout the period of 1802‚Äì1822 including the Second Maratha War and Third Maratha War. *Early wars: Leswaree, Hindoostan, Alma, Balaklava, Inkerman, Sevastopol, Afghanistan 1879‚Äì80, South Africa 1900‚Äì02 *First World War: Givenchy 1914, Somme 1916; 1918, Cambrai 1917; 1918, Bapaume 1918, Rosieres 1918, Amiens 1918, Albert 1918, Beaurevoir, Pursuit to Mons, France and Flanders 1914‚Äì1918 *Second World War: Villers Bocage, Mont Pincon, Dives Crossing, Nederrijn, Best, Lower Maas, Roer, Rhine, North-West Europe 1944‚Äì45, Egyptian Frontier 1940, Sidi Barrani, Buq Buq, Sidi Rezegh 1941, Relief of Tobruk 1941, Gazala, Bir el Igela, Mersa Matruh, Alam el Halfa, El Alamein, North Africa 1940‚Äì42, *Korean War: Seoul, Hill 327, Imjin, Kowang-San, Korea 1950‚Äì51 Notable personalities * Field Marshal Sir John French, 1st Earl of Ypres * General Sir Robert \\"Rollo\\" Gillespie 1766‚Äì1814 * General Sir John Hackett (British Army officer) * Lieutenant General James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan * Lieutenant the Hon.

The goblet in the centre is 11 inches (28 cm) high. Bristol blue glass has been made in Bristol, England, since the 18th century, with a break between the 1920s and 1980s.  History  During the late 18th century Richard Champion, a Bristol merchant and potter, making Bristol porcelain, was working with a chemist, William Cookworthy. Cookworthy began a search for good quality cobalt oxide to give the blue glaze decoration on the white porcelain and obtained exclusive import rights to all the cobalt oxide from the Royal Saxon Cobalt Works in Saxony. It is uncertain when Bristol blue glass was first made but the quality and beauty of the glass swiftly gained popularity, with seventeen glass houses being set up in the city. Lazarus and Isaac Jacobs were the most famous makers of Bristol blue glass in the 1780s. Lazarus Jacobs was a Jewish immigrant to Bristol from Frankfurt am Main, Germany. In 1774, at the age of seventeen, Isaac joined his father's glass cutting firm at 108 Temple Street, Bristol, and launched Bristol Blue glass as a national brand, using the cobalt oxide Cookworthy imported. Isaac was responsible for the great growth of the company, and the expansion of its goods.

Bristol‚Äôs glass makers were invited to demonstrate their skills at the Great Exhibition of 1851, opened by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. At this period cranberry glass was made for the first time by adding 24 carat gold to lead crystal, giving the glass its ruby red tones. Production ceased in about 1923.The History of Bristol Blue Glass . Accessed 23 May 2011 Revival Bristol-based glass makers James Adlington and Peter Sinclair held their Hot Glass exhibition in 1988 at Hand Made Glass, Bristol. This exhibition led to a revival of Bristol's hand blown glass industry and the creation of a Company that has spawned the careers of many other studio Glassmakers in the South west. Today, Bristol Blue Glass is produced by The Original Bristol Blue Glass Ltd in Brislington, established in 1988. In the 1990s, John Harvey & Sons of Bristol began to sell Bristol Cream sherry in bottles made from Bristol blue.

Career She was born in Hungary to professional musician parents who toured worldwide. Educated in Switzerland, she studied piano before joining her parents on tour as the juggling act, Three Hugos. When the Second World War was declared, the family left Britain with the Boswell Circus. She married, and as Eve Boswell became a popular singing star in South Africa. In 1949, she was heard by bandleader Geraldo (Gerald Bright), who persuaded her to return to Britain as a singer in his band, which was widely heard on BBC Radio. Boswell parted with Geraldo in 1951, and launched a solo career. Her first hit record came the following year with \\"Sugar Bush\\", partly sung in Afrikaans. She appeared in the 1953 Royal Variety Performance and toured widely with comedian Derek Roy, before getting her own radio show in 1954. Her major chart hit came with \\"Pickin' a Chicken\\", a South African tune with new words, which rose to No. 9 on the UK Singles Chart at the start of 1956. Her first LP, Sugar and Spice, on which she sang 10 songs in nine different languages, followed later in the year. A continuous programme of radio work and tours followed, leading to more than one mental breakdown. She faded from public view as public tastes for pop music changed through the late 1950s and 1960s, eventually returning to live in Durban, South Africa, where she died.

He made a total of 241 Football League appearances for Everton, Crystal Palace, Orient and Bournemouth, scoring 46 goals. He also spent a season with Iranian side Persepolis where he made 34 appearances and scored 16 goals. Club career Whittle was a product of the Everton youth academy and debuted for the first-team in 1967 at the age of 17. In five years at Everton Whittle made 74 appearances scoring 21 goals, but found it difficult to establish himself in the first-team. Whittle's nickname was The Hustler at Everton, though he campaigned in The Toffees football in the community scheme. The highlight of his time at Everton was being part of the side that won the First Division in the 1969‚Äì70 season; making 15 appearances and scoring 11 goals in the process. In December 1972, Whittle was sold to Crystal Palace for a then large fee of ¬£100,000. Whittle spent four years of his career at Palace; however, his stay was dogged by injury and bad form, leading him to fall out of favour with then coach Malcolm Allison, Whittle did make a century of appearances for Palace and was a fan favourite. Palace fans would chant \\"We want Whittle\\" and \\"The Roker roar is no more, Whittle showed them how to score\\". Whittle spent two one-season spells at Orient scoring six goals in 50 appearances for the club and coming second in the Anglo-Scottish Cup. Whittle surprised many by spending one season at Iranian club Persepolis F.C. in the 1977‚Äì78 season where he competed in the Takht Jamshid Cup, however because of the Iranian Revolution and collapse of the national league Whittle had no choice but to leave Iran. Whittle was the first English footballer ever to play in the Iranian football league system. Ultimately, Whittle ended his career at A.F.C. Bournemouth at the age of 30 making just nine appearances for the club. Towards the end of Whittle's career he made a move to Australia, where he played for a year before going to non- league side Gravesend & Northfleet in 1982 ending a career for Whittle who as a youngster had much promise but injury and poor form were to block the extent of his success. International career In 1972, at the age of 22, he was called up by Sir Alf Ramsey, manager of the English national football team; however, he did not feature for the side.All Players. englandstats.com Honours *English championship: 1 **1969‚Äì70, Everton *Charity Shield: 1 **1970, Everton *Anglo-Scottish Cup, Runners-Up **1976‚Äì77, Leyton Orient *Takht Jamshid Cup, Runners-Up **1977‚Äì78, Persepolis Personal life Whittle is the uncle of current Everton player Tom Davies.

It is native to south eastern Australia and lives for 15 years on average. They are tolerant of drought and frost. It is a species of wattle, and is also known as wreath wattle or round-leaf wattle. Description The shrub can have a bushy or straggly habit and typically grows to a height of around . It has glabrous or hairy branchlets that are angled at extremities. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The glabrous or hairy, evergreen phyllodes often have an asymmetric oblong-elliptic, broadly obovate or circular shape and have a length of and a width of with an obscure or absent midrib obscure or absent. It blooms, usually prolifically, between July and November producing spherical flower-heads with a diameter of containg 8 to 20 golden coloured flowers. After flowering glaborous, crustaceous seed pods form that are circinnate to spirally coiled or irregularly twisted. The pods have a width of with longitudinally arranged seeds inside. The shiny dark brown seeds have an oblong shape and a length of with a clavate aril that can be half as long as the seed. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist John Lindley in 1838 as part of Thomas Mitchell's work Three Expeditions into the interior of Eastern Australia. It has many synonyms including Acacia acinacea var. acinacea and Racosperma acinaceum. The specific epithet, acinacea, derives from the Latin for a short Persian sword (acinaces) and references the shape of the phyllodes. Distribution It is endemic and common throughout most of Victoria, south eastern South Australia, south eastern New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. It is often found in hilly country and grows well in sand, sandy loam and gravelly soils as a part of Eucalyptus woodlands, woodland heath and open mallee scrubland communities. They are a hardy, free-flowering species with very specific soil requirements. The requirements are that the soil is well-drained and non-saline, although it can tolerate many different types.
