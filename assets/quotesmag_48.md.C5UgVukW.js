Some time later, Stanton Delaplane along with owner Jack Koeppler of the Buena Vista Caf√© in San Francisco, California, tried to recreate this drink. Delaplane and Koeppler worked for hours mixing and sampling different versions of the drink until they achieved the results that they were looking for and almost passed out in the process. The two men solicited the advice of the mayor of San Francisco at that time since he was also a prominent dairy owner. The method for floating the cream on top of the coffee was suggested to them by Mayor, George Christopher, who told them that the cream should be aged at least 48 hours in order that it would be more apt to float atop the coffee.

Early life and family Rudra was a second generation Bengali Christian from a large land holding family of Bansberia in the Hooghly District of Bengal. His father Pyari Mohun Rudra converted to Christianity in 1860 under the influence of the Scottish missionary Alexander Duff and his mother followed suit the following year. His father subsequently became a missionary working with the Church Mission Society in Calcutta and in rural Bengal. Rudra graduated from the University of Calcutta and left for Punjab where he became a member of staff of St Stephen's College in 1886. Rudra married Priyobala Singh in 1889 who died of typhoid in 1897. The couple had three sons, the youngest of whom, Ajit Anil Rudra, was one of the first Indians to receive the King's Commission in the Punjab Regiment, going on to become a Major General in the Indian Army.  At St Stephen's College  Rudra worked at St Stephen's College from 1886 until his retirement in 1923 where he variously taught English, economics and logic. In 1906, he became its fourth, and first Indian, principal and served in that post until his retirement in 1923. It is thought that Rudra might have been the first Indian to hold that post in any missionary institution in India. Under Rudra, the college grew both in size and reputation and became a largely residential college. Along with C F Andrews, Rudra drew up a constitution for the college that helped Indianise it, gradually moving administrative control away from its founders, the Cambridge Brotherhood. It was also under him that a policy of equal pay for staff irrespective of race was adopted at the college.  Gandhi's associate Rudra was a close friend and associate of Gandhi and of C F Andrews. On Gandhi's maiden visit to Delhi after his return from South Africa, he stayed with Principal Rudra at his official residence on the College premises in Kashmere Gate. Later, the draught for the Non- Cooperation Movement and an open letter to the Viceroy outlining the Khilafat demand were also prepared at this house. While Gandhi revered him as a 'silent servant', he was reluctant to stay with him after the declaration of the anti- Rowlatt Satyagraha fearing it would compromise Rudra and expose the college to unnecessary risk. Gandhi's demurrals were however rejected by Rudra who saw this hospitality as only 'a little service to his country'. Rudra held a close friendship with Andrews who joined St Stephen's College in 1904. Andrews turned down the job of Principal in 1906 to enable Rudra to become the college's first Indian principal. In 1911, Rudra helped Lala Hardayal, a Stephanian who headed the Ghadar Movement leave the country. Inspired by Rudra, Andrews and Rev William Pearson left for South Africa in 1914 to persuade Gandhi to return to India and lead the country's freedom struggle. Andrews was also responsible for bringing together Rudra, Rabindranath Tagore, Gandhi and Sarojini Naidu in memorable friendships. It is believed that Tagore finalised the English draft of the Gitanjali while staying at Rudra's residence when he visited St Stephen's College in October 1916.  Death and commemoration Rudra retired to Solan in Himachal Pradesh on his superannuation from St Stephen's College in 1923. He died there, aged 64, on 29 June 1925 and is buried at the English Chapel in Solan. In an obituary Gandhi wrote in Young India, he called Rudra and Andrews his revisionists and described Rudra as a silent but deeply interested spectator in the happenings of the national struggle. Rudra left a sum of 1,000 to St Stephen's College whose interest would serve to host an annual dinner for the College's servants. The event, called the Rudra Dinner, held on 12 February every year commemorates the death anniversary of Mrs Priyobala Rudra and the birth anniversary of C F Andrews both of which happen to fall on the same day. Rudra was also one of the founding members of the Modern School in Delhi where since 1928, the Rudra Prize has been instituted in his honour. Andrews' works North India (1908) and Sadhu Sundar Singh (1934) are dedicated to Rudra.

He was also a primary advocate of Collectivist Anarchism. Josep Llunas i Pujals c.1900  Organizations  He was a typesetter by profession, but he also studied music and singing and was a theatrical director. Of special significance in this regard was his role as secretary of the Catalan Athenaeum of the Working Classes, a proletarian cultural center which promoted a type of scientific anarchism. Llunas believed that the growth of science would promote social equality. Historia de la Cultura Catalana. Edicions 62, Barcelona. In 1870, he was a supporter of the First International and in 1872 became a member of the Local Federation of Workers' Societies of Barcelona. At the same time, he was involved with the secret committees of the Regional Spanish Federation of the International Workers' Association (IWA) and organized the Typesetters Society of Barcelona in 1879. Two years later, together with Rafael Farga i Pellicer, Anselmo Lorenzo and other prominent anarchists, he helped found the Workers Federation of the Spanish Region (FTRE) and remained on the national committee until 1883. Publications He founded and managed the satirical journal La Tramuntana (West by Northwest), also known as \\"El peri√≤dic vermell\\" (The red paper). It was published from 1881 to 1896 and was the first weekly anarchist publication in Catal√°n. It took an aggressively anti-clerical and pro-working class approach and its contributors included many well-known leftist writers of the time, such as Eudald Canivell, Cels Gomis, Anselmo Lorenzo, Emili Guanyavents and Antoni Pellicer. Llunas also managed La Asociaci√≥n, a cooperativist magazine. He was jailed in 1893 during a general arrest and detention of anarchists, prompted by a bomb blast in the Liceu Theater that killed 20 people. After he was freed, he largely abandoned active participation in the workers' movement. Instead, he dedicated himself to the management of several weeklies and newspapers. These included El Productor (where he continued his collaborations with major anarchists such as Joan Montseny, Fernando Tarrida del M√°rmol and Teresa Ma√±√©) and Los Deportes (Sports).

Service history After being laid down in 1898, Koningen Regentes was built at the Rijkswerf in Amsterdam and launched on 24 April 1900. The ship was christened there by the Dutch Queen Mother, Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont and was then commissioned into the Royal Netherlands Navy on 3 January 1902. On 11 March that year she departed from the port of Vlissingen bound for the Dutch West Indies in response to rising political tension between the Netherlands and Venezuela to evacuate the Jews of Coro to Cura√ßao.

After this, the ship continued her journey in concert with and on 2 April 1902 they arrived in the Venezuelan port of La Guaira. Prior to their arrival, the Venezuelan Navy had repeatedly checked Dutch and Antillean merchant ships and the presence of the Dutch warships acted as a deterrent against further actions. In 1906 Koningin Regentes, along with her sister ship and the protected cruiser , assisted in an expedition to the island of Bali in the Dutch East Indies as part of Dutch attempts to integrate the southern kingdoms of Tabanan, Badung and Klungkung into the Dutch East Indies. On 16 and 17 September, the ships bombarded the city of Denpasar and afterwards ground forces broke what resistance remained. 10 August 1909 the ship, together with and De Ruyter, departed from Batavia to China, Hong Kong, Japan and the Philippines to show the flag.

Casualties and causes  left Nine coke workers were shot and killed during a strike for higher wages and an eight-hour work day. The United Mine Workers union, formed only the previous year, organized the strike against the local coke works owned by industrialist Henry Clay Frick. After a work stoppage beginning on February 10, weeks of increasing unrest, and evictions of mining families from company-controlled property, a crowd of about a thousand strikers accompanied by a brass band marched on the company store. Deputized members of the 10th regiment of the National Guard under the command of Captain Loar fired several volleys into the crowd, killing six strikers outright and fatally wounding three more. Thousands attended their funeral. A Pennsylvania state historical marker describing the Morewood event was erected in 2000 on Route 981 (Morewood Road) near the Route 119 overpass.http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-2CB  Gallery  See also * Homestead strike of 1892 * Johnstown Flood of 1889 * Mammoth Mine disaster ‚Äì January 27, 1891 gas explosion at Frick's coal mine in Mount Pleasant * Murder of workers in labor disputes in the United States  References   External links  * Simonich, Milan. 118 killed in 1891 Frick massacre and mine explosion to get markers.

The film revolves around the life of Tarak, a foley artist of Bengali film. Tarak's job is to create ambient sounds for films, but, he gradually gets trapped in his own world, a world full of sound (i.e. Shabdo). It won the 60th National Film Awards for Best Feature Film in Bengali and the Best Audiography.  Plot  The protagonist of the film is Tarak Dutta (Ritwik Chakraborty), a foley artist. He is so obsessed with his work that he loses his grip on words and his mind starts registering only foley sounds. The film starts showing Tarak's distraught wife who has taken him to a psychiatrist for treatment because she feels that he lives in a world of his own. The psychiatrist (Churni Ganguly) discovers that actually there is nothing wrong with Tarak's hearing ability. He just concentrates so much on background sounds that he does not pay attention to vocal sounds. While the doctor is speaking to him, Tarak is busy listening to the sounds of traffic in the streets or the sound of the Rubik's cube that she is holding in her hands. The doctor tries to convince Tarak that he has a serious problem and he needs treatment. But Tarak is not ready to believe that he has any problem. On the doctor's advice Tarak's wife take him to Siliguri for a short holiday. Even there Tarak keeps listening to all the natural sounds like the twittering of birds or the gush of water in a mountain spring. On the trip, Tarak tries to convince his wife that there is nothing wrong with him. He just keeps thinking about sounds because that's his job. Tarak starts rebelling against the doctor and refuse to take treatment. Things come to a head, when the doctor tries to talk to him through headphones at this recording studio and Tarak breaks the mike in anger. With all her efforts gone to waste the doctor refers him to her professor (Victor Banerjee). Tarak loses his job and becomes quite depressed. He is always haunted by sounds and without his job he starts feeling dis- oriented. One day he tries to commit suicide. Finally, the doctors send Tarak to a rehabilitation center where he is made to listen to recorded human voices daily to get back to normal.  Cast  * Ritwik Chakraborty as Tarak Dutta * Raima Sen as Tarak's wife * Churni Ganguly as Psychiatrist. * Victor Banerjee as the psychiatrist's professor * Srijit Mukherji as sound engineer, Tarak's boss  Making  The shooting of the film started in October 2011. Firstly Rudranil Ghosh was thought of playing the lead character Tarak. But, later Ritwik Chakraborty was cast for this character. Shirsha Ray and Mainak Bhaumik are roped as the cinematographer and editor respectively, for the film.  Release and reception  The film premiered on 10 December 2012 in Dubai Film Festival. The film had its theatrical release on April 12, 2013. The film was widely appreciated by reviewers. Leading Bengali newspaper Anandabazar Patrika called the film a \\"silent revolution\\" and gave it 9.5 out of 10 stars which was Anandabazar's all time highest. The Times of India in their review commented that the film was very much different from other contemporary Indian and Bengali films and they also offered a \\"bow\\" to director Kaushik Ganguly for making such a film on a crucial subject of cinema.

Painted by Alexander Nasmyth in 1788. Mary Primrose is second from the right. Lady Mary Shepherd, n√©e Primrose (31 December 1777 ‚Äì 7 January 1847) was a Scottish philosopher who published two philosophical books, one in 1824 and one in 1827. According to Robert Blakey, in her entry in his History of the Philosophy of the Mind, she exercised considerable influence over the Edinburgh philosophy of her day. Life Lady Mary Primrose was the second daughter of Neil Primrose, 3rd Earl of Rosebery. She was born at Barnbougle Castle on the family estate near Dalmeny, Midlothian. Privately educated, she married an English barrister, Henry John Shepherd, in 1808. Although Shepherd's philosophical books only appeared in the 1820s, a memoir by her daughter indicates that their composition in fact predated her marriage. In the first, an essay on the relation between cause and effect, she criticised the views of David Hume, Thomas Brown and the physiologist William Lawrence. In her second book of essays, on the perception of an external universe, she argued against both the idealism of George Berkeley and Thomas Reid's epistemological reliance on natural instinct. Shepherd's correspondence shows a continuing interest in philosophical questions. A private philosophical controversy with the amateur philosopher John Fearn over the relation between perception and physical extension was published in Parriana (1828). After learning of its publication, Shepherd wrote in defence of her position in Fraser's.

The mineral texture of alligator gar scales consists of bundles of cross-plied hydroxyapatite minerals oriented towards the scale's surface. Ganoine or ganoin is a glassy, often multi-layered mineralized tissue that covers the scales, cranial bones and fin rays in some non-teleost ray-finned fishes, such as gars, bichirs, and coelacanths. It is composed of rod-like, pseudoprismatic apatite crystallites, with less than 5% of organic matter. Existing fish groups featuring ganoin are bichirs and gars, but ganoin is also characteristic of several extinct taxa. It is a characteristic component of ganoid scales. Ganoine is an ancient feature of ray-finned fishes, being found for example on the scales of stem group actinopteryigian Cheirolepis. While often considered a synapomorphic character of ray-finned fishes, ganoine or ganoine-like tissues are also found on the extinct acanthodii. It has been suggested that ganoine is homologous to tooth enamel in vertebrates or even considered a type of enamel. Ganoine indeed contains amelogenin-like proteins and has a mineral content similar to that of tetrapod tooth enamel.

Spengler, who was believed to have deliberately set the fire. Two of the firefighters were killed. Shooting According to police, Spengler set his house on 191 Lake Road and the family car on fire in the early morning hours of Christmas Eve, and then armed himself with three guns: a Smith & Wesson .38-caliber revolver, a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun, and a .223-caliber Bushmaster AR-15 style rifle. When firefighters arrived shortly after 5:30 a.m., Spengler ambushed them from an earthen berm across the street from his house. Two firefighters were killed, and two others were injured. Spengler exchanged shots with police, who arrived with an armored truck to remove the firefighters and 33 nearby civilians. Spengler ran after getting shot at and died when he shot himself in the head. His body was discovered nearly six hours later. Due to the shooting, fire crews were unable to resume fighting the blaze until 11:30 a.m. By then, six other houses had burned to the ground, and two others had been rendered uninhabitable. A severely burned body found inside Spengler's house is believed to be Spengler's 67-year-old sister Cheryl, with whom he was living. The shooting was suspected to have followed an argument between Spengler and Cheryl. A two-to-three-page typewritten letter written by Spengler was found at the scene. It reflected Spengler's intent to ambush first responders, but offered no motive for the shooting. In it, he wrote, \\"I still have to get ready to see how much of the neighborhood I can burn down, and do what I like doing best, killing people.\\"New York Times coverage of William Spengler Victims The two firefighters killed in the shooting were 43-year-old Michael Chiapperini, Past Chief of the West Webster Fire District and Lieutenant and public information officer for the Webster Police Department, and 19-year-old Tomasz Kaczowka, who also worked as a 911 dispatcher. The two wounded firefighters were Joseph Hofstetter, who was shot in the pelvis (with the bullet then lodged in his spine), and Theodore Scardino, who was shot in the chest and knee. Both were hospitalized at Strong Memorial Hospital for serious injuries, and were declared to be in stable condition. In addition to the two wounded firefighters, police officer Jon Ritter was slightly injured when a bullet hit the windshield of his car. Perpetrator Police identified the gunman as 62-year-old local resident William H. Spengler, Jr. Spengler previously spent 17 years in prison for murdering his 92-year-old grandmother with a hammer in 1980. He had not attracted the attention of police since then. William Spengler \\"could not stand\\" his sister Cheryl, according to a friend, Roger Vercruysse. Spengler's mother Arline, to whom he was said to have been close, died two months earlier. Investigators immediately began focusing on how Spengler obtained the gun. New York, like nearly all other states, bars convicted felons from buying, owning or possessing a firearm. Before the day was out, agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms discovered that the Bushmaster rifle and the shotgun had been purchased in June 2010 at Gander Mountain in Henrietta, another Rochester suburb. The owner of record was Dawn Nguyen, a neighbor of Spengler, who had recently moved to the suburb of Greece. In an interview with agents that night, Nguyen admitted to buying the guns, but claimed they had then been stolen. However, according to investigators, Nguyen texted a Monroe County sheriff's deputy the next day and admitted buying the guns for Spengler in an illegal straw purchase. On December 28, William Hochul, the United States Attorney for the Western District of New York, announced that Nguyen had been arrested and charged with knowingly making a false statement in connection with the purchase of a firearm from a Federal Firearms Licensee. She also faces state charges of filing a false business record‚Äîthe form she filled out stating that she was the owner of the guns.Police: Greece woman bought guns used in Webster firefighter ambush . WHAM-TV, 2012-12-28. In 2014, Nguyen was sentenced to eight years in prison for her involvement.

The selective vulnerability of certain neurons can then lead to the expression of pathology. Pathoclisis has been postulated to mediate the sensory effects of a near-death experience. Research C√©cile Vogt-Mugnier and her husband Oskar Vogt came up with the idea of pathoclisis through their research on insects and the human cerebral cortex. They defined it as the \\"genomically-determined excessive variability, reaching in intensity the degree of pathological change\\". Mechanism More so than any other organ, the brain is remarkably heterogeneous in its cellular composition. The wide variety of cell types might thus be the basis for selective vulnerability. Role in neurodegenerative diseases Subcortical structures, such as basal ganglia and the brain stem, are particularly vulnerable to ATP depletion, explaining why parkinsonism and depressive symptoms are among the earliest symptoms of vascular dementia, hypoxia, carbon monoxide poisoning, chronic intoxication by mitochondrial complex I inhibitors (such as rotenone and annonaceous acetogenins) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

Accessed 2012-12-24. Gary Iwamoto described him in 2005 as \\"perhaps the most prominent local [Seattle] businessman of the early 20th Century\\" and \\"certainly the top businessman among Japanese on the Pacific Coast\\" during that period. Furuya was born in 1862 in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, the son of Heibei and T. Ariidzumi Furuya. His mother died when he was still a child. At 13 he apprenticed at a confectionery, but eventually entered a private school. He received a teacher's credential at 21 and entered the Imperial Japanese Army at 22. He served three years at the Azabu First Infantry Regiment in Tokyo. By the time he left the military he had formed an ambition to emigrate to the North America. To avoid ending up a laborer in America, he apprenticed again, this time as a tailor. Three years later, at the age of 28, he landed in Vancouver, British Columbia, soon heading south into the United States. over the next year or two, he worked in Seattle, Chicago, St. Louis, variously tailoring and working in grocery stores, before returning to Seattle in December 1892, where he opened a grocery store and tailor shop at 303 Yesler Way.Bagley gives this history slightly differently, not mentioning any North American travels besides Seattle, and suggesting, without stating, a transition from opening a tailor shop in Seattle in 1890 to being in general merchandise two years later. He proved an able merchant, and his Furuya Company made profits in trade related to the Sino-Japanese War and Klondike Gold Rush, and gained many customers in Seattle's growing Japanese community: this was the period in which the N.Y.K. line (now Nippon Yusen) began direct steamship service between Seattle and Yokohama. Seattle's Japanese population grew from 125 in 1890 to 2,884 in 1900.Quintard Taylor, \\"Blacks and Asians in a White City: Japanese Americans and African Americans in Seattle, 1890-1940\\" p. 187-216 in Racial Encounters in the Multi-Cultured West: The American West (2001), Garland Publishing (Taylor & Francis), Gordon Morris Bakken, Brenda Gail Farrington eds. . p. 194. His blue-suited \\"Furuya men\\" traveled the west, taking orders for goods from Japanese laborers throughout the region. His business came to involve wholesale, retail, and import-export. Besides being a major supplier of Japanese foodstuffs in the region, he opened an Oriental fine arts store in 1895, which eventually came to be located at 1304 Second Avenue (today, part of the site of Benaroya Hall, Seattle's symphony hall), and started the Furuya Construction Company, mainly a labor contractor, which helped build the Great Northern Railway, the Milwaukee Road and the Oregon Short Line. The rear of the Furuya Building at 216 South Second Avenue features prominently in this 1936 photo of flooded streets in Seattle's Pioneer Square--Skid Road neighborhood. In 1900, a headquarters was built to his specifications at 216 South Second Avenue, mainly for his grocery and Japanese art products business, and became a focal point of Seattle's then- thriving Nihonmachi or Japantown. Furuya reinforced his role as a leader of the Japanese community by purchasing the Nippon Kan (Japanese Hall) and as a key supporter of Japanese-American efforts at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition.\\"Rival businessmen unite to build the Streets of Tokio\\", in AYPE Japan, cinarc.org (Chinese in Northwest America Research Committee), 2009-07-06. Accessed 2012-12-24. The company also engaged in real estate, postal service, banking, and printing, and sold rice to the Imperial Japanese Navy. At its height the Furuya Company had North American branch offices in Portland, Oregon (established 1895), Tacoma, Washington (established 1900), and Vancouver, B.C. (established 1904), as well as Japanese branch offices in Yokohama (established 1898), Kobe (established 1903), Yokosuka, and a sub- branch in Tokyo. It was the most important career opportunity for skilled and educated Japanese and Japanese Americans in Seattle, because white-owned companies would generally not hire them except as laborers. Still, Furuya worked his employees hardRonald Takaki, Strangers from a Different Shore: A History of Asian Americans, p. 363 et. seq. Online on Google Books.

There were no vacations except a once-a- year company outing to the gardens of Furuya's summer house, the Furuya Resort House at Crystal Springs on Bainbridge Island, overlooking Port Orchard Bay on Puget Sound.\\"The Furuya House: the best-preserved early Asian-American residence in the Pacific Northwest\\" and \\"Furuya's trees: the oldest living Asian-American plants in the Pacific Northwest\\", in AYPE Japan, cinarc.org (Chinese in Northwest America Research Committee), 2009-07-06. Accessed 2012-12-24. The Furuya Resort House was built on a property that included of the Bainbridge Island shore. The grounds had two stone lanterns, a pond and bridge, a large greenhouse and eight hothouses, with 5,000 pots of lilies, cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, geraniums, and chrysanthemums. He experimented with bamboos and was probably the first to import udo (Aralia cordata) and certain types of soybeans used in making soy sauce. He had paulownias, maples, wisteria, Japanese cypress, and cryptomeria shipped from Japan. Besides the annual visit by his employees, it was open on Sundays for picnics by University of Washington students and local prefectural associations (associations of people tracing their ancestry to a particular Japanese prefecture). The house survives, as do many of the plants, although the paulownias are gone. The Whitman family, owners of the house since the late 1970s, continue to host an annual Japanese Community Picnic.Michele Whitman, \\"Masajiro Furuya: Aggressive Businessman, Gentle Gardener, and Bainbridge Islander\\", in Summaries of Symposium Presentations, cinarc.org (Chinese in Northwest America Research Committee), 2009.

Most of the year he and his family lived on the upper floor of the company boarding house and he ate a simple, largely traditional Japanese diet. Even the summer house with its commanding view, surrounded on three sides by a verandah, was quite modest on the inside. The interior of the second floor was never finished or used. Despite his austere lifestyle and strong Christian beliefs, Ronald Takaki writes that Furuya's fortune may have had significant roots in the underground economy of Seattle's Skid Road. Takaki describes it as \\"the accepted opinion among the Seattle community\\" that beginning in his days as a tailor Furuya functioned as a trusted banker for Seattle prostitutes. \\"[S]ome of them may have died or moved away‚Ä¶ without requesting the money back. As a result, Furuya, they say, made big money out of it.\\" Furuya traveled to Japan in 1903 to get married. He and his wife Hatsu Shibata returned to Seattle. They had two daughters, both of whom attended Seattle public schools. Building on his success as a merchant, Furuya became a banker. He founded the Japanese Commercial Bank in 1907; it became the cornerstone of a banking empire that eventually consolidated the Oriental American Bank, and the Seattle Specie Bank in 1928 under his Pacific Commercial Bank and Pacific Holding Company. His role as a merchant and banker allowed him entree into circles not usually open to Japanese Americans. He was a member of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, an honorary member of the United States Chamber of Commerce, was praised in Clarence Bagley's History of Seattle (1916) as \\"a man of unusual business ability and keen insight,\\" and was listed in Who‚Äôs Who in Washington State in 1927. However, the Great Depression and mismanagement of the Seattle Specie Bank turned him from a millionaire to bankrupt. Like many Japanese American (and other American) bankers of the time, he had overextended, invested in stocks that plummeted, and made unsecured loans. He sought but failed to obtain a rescue from the Sumitomo Bank and the Yokohama Specie Bank. This was before the time of deposit insurance in the United States, and Furuya's failure was an economic disaster for Seattle's Japanese community, leading to the failure of many businesses along Seattle's Main Street. Furuya moved to Southern California and tried unsuccessfully to reestablish himself, finally returning, ill, to Japan, where he died in Yokohama on February 15, 1938. The First National Bank (later Seafirst Bank, eventually absorbed by Bank of America) saw opportunity in the financial void left by Furuya's collapse, and started its \\"International Branch\\" on Jackson Street April 10, 1934. The Bank of America Branch at Sixth and Jackson in what is today known as Chinatown-International District is a direct descendant of that branch.

He received a BFA from Texas Tech University in 1987, and an MFA from Penn State University in 1991. Gipson served as a volunteer firefighter and worked as a design director for MTV Networks and a designer for Rockwell Architecture, before opening his own business. In 2006, Gipson opened Gipson Design Group, located in Rhinebeck, New York, where he was twice elected a trustee to the Rhinebeck Village Board before winning election to the Senate. He closed his business in January 2013, in order to work full-time as a senator. Political career 2012 New York State Senate election Gipson is a Democrat who was elected to the New York Senate in 2012 by edging longtime Republican Senator Stephen Saland by 2,100 votes following Saland's controversial 2011 vote in favor of same-sex marriage. Gipson was not Saland's only opponent; Saland also faced a challenge from Neil Di Carlo, who received 17,000 votes on the Conservative line. Gipson is the first and only Democrat since Franklin Delano Roosevelt to have held this seat.Franklin D. Roosevelt State Senate tenure As a Senator, Gipson successfully advocated for the inclusion of Dutchess and Putnam counties in the 0% manufacturing tax plan passed in the 2014‚Äì2015 state budget. His Senate office helped secure millions of dollars in grants for new job-creating enterprises throughout the Hudson Valley, and secured construction grants for The Center for the Prevention of Child Abuse in Poughkeepsie and The Imagination Station in Kent. Gipson sponsored legislation that became law and designated Wappinger Creek as an inland waterway. This act provided the opportunity for the 13 surrounding municipalities to apply for state and federal funding for waterfront revitalization, storm water treatment, and wastewater management, among other projects. Gipson‚Äôs office organized a strategic campaign to help the State Senate understand the urgency of helping victims with Lyme disease. During his term, the state began the process of providing funding for research and passing laws to help the victims of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. Gipson supported a $9 million increase to the Environmental Protection Fund and a $90 million investment in New York State Parks funding in the 2014-15 state budget. He supported a ban on hydrofracking and on the use of fracking chemicals as road de-icer in New York.

He previously played for the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL). He is the older brother to Markus, who plays in Sweden with Leksands IF. Playing career Lauridsen hails from Gentofte, Denmark, where he started playing ice hockey in the youth ranks of IC Gentofte. He moved to Sweden in 2005 to join R√∂gle BK before heading to Link√∂ping HC one year later. He played for both clubs at the youth level. In 2008, Lauridsen enrolled at St. Cloud State University. He was drafted by the Philadelphia Flyers 196th overall in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft and signed a two-year entry-level contract with the Flyers on 15 March 2011 after his third season of college hockey at St. Cloud State. On 29 March 2013, after spending one season with the Adirondack Phantoms he was called up to replace the injured Braydon Coburn. He debuted the next day in a game against the Boston Bruins. A month later, Lauridsen scored his first NHL goal after Boston defenseman Zdeno Ch√°ra's attempt to clear the puck deep in his own zone managed to slip past Boston goaltender Anton Khudobin and into the net. Lauridsen was credited with the goal since he was the last Flyers player to have touched the puck and it proved to be the game-winning goal. Two days later he scored the game-winner again, this time via a slapshot that eluded New York Islanders goaltender Kevin Poulin. During his time in North America, he played a total of 16 NHL contests for the Flyers and 264 games in the American Hockey League for the Adirondack Phantoms and Lehigh Valley Phantoms. On 13 July 2015, Lauridsen signed with Fr√∂lunda HC of the Swedish Hockey League and helped the team win the Swedish national championship and the Champions Hockey League in the 2015‚Äì16 season. In April 2016, he penned a deal with Helsinki based KHL team Jokerit. After four seasons in the KHL with Jokerit, Lauridsen opted to return to the SHL, agreeing to a three-year contract with the Malm√∂ Redhawks on 29 April 2020.

The DVD version was released on January 6, 2014. Reception The film received negative ratings, but critics have noted that the film is entertaining despite its lack of quality. The New York Times stated that \\"the movie gets an F in most of the traditional critical categories. Dialogue? F. Coherence? F. But in terms of serving as a counterweight to the syrupy fare that clogs almost every other network at this time of year, this ridiculous mess earns an A+.\\" The New York Daily News gave the film one star out of five, opining that \\"some bad movies just bore you, while others create a perverse fascination, an aura that keeps you watching in the hope they will never get better. The Twelve Disasters of Christmas does not. It stays true to the path on which it embarked, seemingly never troubled for a second by concern for trivial matters like, oh, dialogue or plot.\\" The A.V.

Polynesian arrowroot or pia (Tacca leontopetaloides), and Japanese arrowroot (Pueraria lobata), also called kudzu, are used in similar ways.  History  Archaeological studies in the Americas show evidence of arrowroot cultivation as early as 7,000 years ago. The name may come from aru-aru (meal of meals) in the language of the Caribbean Arawak people, for whom the plant was a staple. It has also been suggested that the name comes from arrowroot's use in treating poison-arrow wounds, as it draws out the poison when applied to the site of the injury. In the early days of carbonless copy paper, arrowroot, because of its fine grain- size, was a widely used ingredient. After an economical way of centrifugally separating wheat flour was devised, arrowroot lost its role in papermaking.The Story of Paper-Making Cultivation in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Saint Vincent has a long history of arrowroot production. The industry started as the food and medicine of the Carib and Garifuna peoples, and developed to the status of a major export of St. Vincent during the period 1900 to 1965. It became an important commodity in colonial trade in the 1930s. As the sugar industry declined in the nineteenth century, cultivation of arrowroot was developed to fill the void. Since then, the area cultivated has declined steadily as other crops, particularly bananas, have gained wider acceptance by farmers. Evidence of its former importance is indicated by the ruins of the various magnificent 19th-century factories located in valleys on the St. Vincent mainland.The arrowroot industry in St. Vincent: A case study of a unique root crop industry. C. I. Martin. First Triennial Symposium of Tropical root and tuber crops. University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad. 1967. Editors: Egvert A. Tai, W. B. Charles, P. H. Haynes, E. F. Iton, K. A. Leslie. Vol 2 Section V Arrowroot cultivation is now concentrated on farms located north of the Rabacca River, particularly in the Owia area. This is also the area where the population of Carib descent is concentrated. In 1998/99, the industry produced of starch, about 3% of the peak level in the 1960s. In the past, the St. Vincent arrowroot industry played an important role in the economy of the island, contributing close to 50% of the country's foreign export earnings, and was the principal source of employment and income of the rural people from the 1930s to the 1960s. The plant is propagated from rhizomes and cultivation takes place at elevations up to 300 metres on the eastern and windward facing side of the highlands of St. Vincent. Cultivation covers an area of about 3,700 ha and some 80% of the crop is grown by small farmers. The arrowroot plant is very hardy and not very demanding in its requirements. St. Vincent, particularly the north-east coast, provides the ideal growing conditions for optimal yields; deep, well drained, slightly acidic soils and a hot, humid climate. Some farmers produce the crop by shifting cultivation on the cleared forested slopes. The harvesting season extends from October to May. On the larger estates, the harvesting of the rhizome usually proceeds from the base of a hill towards the top. Harvesting involves breaking off the rhizome from the shoot. Planting and harvesting are inter-related in that when the rhizomes are harvested the shoot is replanted at the same time. In St. Vincent, much use is made of rural unemployment and many women workers are involved in the various phases of operation. Mechanical harvesters have recently been introduced, allowing faster arrowroot harvesting. Six factories process the island's arrowroot and large processing plants are located at Belle Vue and at Owia. Starch extraction process Arrowroot tubers contain about 23% starch. They are first washed, and then cleaned of the paper-like scale. The scales must be carefully removed before extracting the starch because they impart a disagreeable flavour. After removing the scale, the roots are washed again, drained and finally reduced to a pulp by beating them in mortars or subjecting them to the action of a wheel rasp. The milky liquid thus obtained is passed through a coarse cloth or hair sieve and the pure starch, which is insoluble, is allowed to settle at the bottom. The wet starch is dried in the sun or in a drying house. The result is a powder, the \\"arrowroot\\" of commerce, that is quickly packed for market in air-tight cans, packages or cases. Arrowroot starch has in the past been quite extensively adulterated with potato starch and other similar substances. Pure arrowroot, like other pure starches, is a light, white powder (the mass feeling firm to the finger and crackling like newly fallen snow when rubbed or pressed), odourless when dry, but emitting a faint, peculiar odour when mixed with boiling water, and swelling on cooking into a perfect jelly, which can be used to make a food that is very smooth in consistency‚Äîunlike adulterated articles, mixed with potato flour and other starches of lower value, which contain larger particles. Microscopically the arrow root starch is oval in shape and with hilum at the proximal end. Cooking Custard with an arrowroot biscuit on top Arrowroot was very popular in the Victorian era, and Napoleon supposedly said the reason for the British love of arrowroot was to support the commerce of their colonies. It can be consumed in the form of biscuits, puddings, jellies, cakes, hot sauces, and also with beef tea, milk or veal broth. Kudzu arrowroot (Pueraria lobata) is used in noodles in Korean and Vietnamese cuisine. In the Victorian era it was used, boiled with a little flavouring added, as an easily digestible food for children and people with dietary restrictions. In Burma, arrowroot tubers, which are called artarlut, are boiled or steamed and eaten with salt and oil. Arrowroot makes clear, shimmering fruit gels and prevents ice crystals from forming in homemade ice cream. It can also be used as a thickener for acidic foods, such as East Asian sweet and sour sauce. It is used in cooking to produce a clear, thickened sauce, such as a fruit sauce. It will not make the sauce go cloudy, like cornstarch, flour, or other starchy thickening agents would. The lack of gluten in arrowroot flour makes it useful as a replacement for wheat flour for those with a gluten intolerance. It is, however, relatively high in carbohydrates and low in protein (approximately 7.7%) and does not provide a complete substitute for wheat flour in bread-making. Arrowroot thickens at a lower temperature than flour or cornstarch, is not weakened by acidic ingredients, has a more neutral taste, and is not affected by freezing. It does not mix well with dairy, forming a slimy mixture.Starch Thickeners at The Cook's Thesaurus It is recommended that arrowroot be mixed with a cool liquid before adding to a hot fluid. The mixture should be heated only until the mixture thickens and removed immediately to prevent the mixture from thinning. Overheating tends to break down arrowroot's thickening property. Two teaspoons of arrowroot can be substituted for one tablespoon of cornstarch, or one teaspoon of arrowroot for one tablespoon of wheat flour.Arrowroot Powder Is A Thickening Agent See also *Polynesian arrowroot  References  * External links * arrowroot paper Category:Crops originating from the Americas Category:Economy of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Category:Edible thickening agents Category:Root vegetables Category:Starch ","title":"Arrowroot"},{"id":"38019019","text":"Fort Peabody was a military post in southwestern Colorado, situated at 13,365 feet elevation on the county line between Ouray and San Miguel Counties, making it the highest historical post of its kind in the United States. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 30, 2005 as significant to the state and nation's labor history.  Overview  The sentry post was built in 1904 during the height of statewide labor disturbances, when the Western Federation of Miners was managing legal strikes in the San Juan district, Cripple Creek district, Colorado City, and other areas of the West. The Fort Peabody site encompasses the ridge above and southeast of the Imogene Pass road summit, spanning approximately 413 feet northwest to southeast on the lower ridge of Telluride Peak. It was a Colorado National Guard sentry post that included a small guardhouse, a flag mount and what some characterized as a sniper's nest. Until 2010, the site consisted of the remains of a 6' x 8' wood frame building enclosed in stone walls, a large stone mound, a 5' x 6' depression, and a small pile of rocks all on the ridge top, along with a stone enclosure down the ridge to the northwest, identified as the \\"sniper nest\\" or \\"machine gun nest.\\" In 2010 Fort Peabody was stabilized and restored under the direction of the San Miguel County Open Space and Recreation office and the USDA Forest Service as directed by the National Historic Preservation Act.  History  Fort Peabody c. 1910, with two unidentified women on the flag mount and the redoubt in backgroundThe New England Exploration Company of Boston took control of the Smuggler-Union Mining Company in Telluride, Colorado in late 1899, at which time a new manager, Arthur L. Collins, was appointed and new management policies were implemented. Collins required mine employees to board at the mine, to buy their mining supplies from the company, and to work under a by-the-fathom contract system, which precipitated the strike of 1901, led by Western Federation of Miners (WFM) Local No. 63 under the direction of its president, Vincent St. John. Despite a brief riot in the morning of 3 July 1901, the strike was successfully concluded on 6 July, with the Miners' Union and Arthur Collins signing an agreement that ended the contract system, giving employees a full day's wage for a full day's work. Since the agreement of 1901 was only between the miners and the company, the mill workers demanded similar compensation in 1903, along with an eight-hour day. The new manager of the Smuggler-Union Mining Company, Bulkeley Wells, refused to negotiate, precipitating the strike of 1903-04. Simultaneously mine and mill workers across Colorado made demands for an eight-hour day, fair wages, and the right to work without discrimination. These miners and mill men were members of the WFM, at that time the largest labor union in the Western states, with a membership over 48,000. Refusing the union's demands, mine owners and managers organized as the Mine Operators Association (MOA) in order to combat what the MOA saw as a growing threat to their political power. In response, WFM locals in various affected regions throughout the state went on strike. In Telluride, Bulkeley Wells and 23 businessmen requested Governor James H. Peabody to send Colorado National Guard troops to San Miguel County in order to break the strike. The Colorado National Guard (CNG) arrived November 24, 1903. Union men were rounded up and forcibly removed from the county. Under Major Zeph Hill martial law was declared January 3, 1904, despite completely peaceful conditions. Hill's daily reports consistently noted that no disturbances occurred. Hill groomed Bulkeley Wells to take his place. Wells created CNG Troop A, First Squadron Cavalry, as a local San Miguel County unit, which Governor Peabody approved in January 1904, making Wells captain. The members were mustered in on January 11. Membership consisted of Wells' Smuggler Mine employees and friends, and cowboys from the west end of the county. These men offered to serve without pay and would furnish their own horses and weapons. Wells paid for their ammunition and rations, housing them in his company's buildings, thereby making it evident that CNG soldiers were in his personal employ. Wells ordered these Troop A soldiers to construct the sentry post above Imogene Pass for the sole purpose of keeping illegally deported union men and their supporters from re-entering San Miguel County. The stone redoubt was called \\"Fort Peabody\\" after the Governor. The National Register of Historic Places nomination document for the site states, \\"No documentation has been located that indicates this was an official name bestowed by the guard or by Wells, or if the miners dubbed it such in a tongue-in-cheek manner. The redoubt had telephone service to town, giving Wells advanced notice if anyone eluded the sentries and headed toward town. The first sentries at this post were armed with rifles and bayonets and their own sidearms. Two or three men on duty at the post slept in the small guardhouse. A flagpole was mounted on the highpoint above the pass at 13,365 feet and the US Flag was said to be visible from the valley west of Telluride. A small stone shelter was built a few dozen yards below the flagpole mount.\\" According to one historical eye- witness, this smaller stone shelter was the 'sniper nest' where a sentry perched with his Krag-Jorgensen rifle trained on the Imogene Pass road. Troop A sentries occupied Fort Peabody after Wells took sole command of the district on February 21, 1904. The post was occupied from that time until martial law was revoked in the district on June 15, 1904. Troop A was mustered out in April 1905 at Wells' request, since he was unable to induce the \\"cow punchers,\\" who made up much of its membership, to attend drills. After this, Wells' mining company employees occupied the post as sentries to thwart union men from using the pass, until about 1908.  Description of the historical site  After abandonment in 1908, Fort Peabody gradually deteriorated due to extreme weather conditions at 13,000 feet. In 2004 it was described in official National Register of Historic Places documents as: ::The remains of the guardhouse are slightly down the eastern slope of the ridge. This is a 6' x 8' wood frame construction surrounded on the north, south, west and part of the east sides by stone walls. The surrounding stone wall is of dry laid, stacked, tabular native stone (loose flat rocks from the ridge). The north and south walls are 5' thick; the north stands 2-1/2' to 4' high; the south stands 1-1/2' to 3'high and is falling to grade at the southeast corner. The west wall is 3-1/2' thick and 2' to 2-1/2' high and is collapsing at the southwest corner. The partial east wall is 2' thick and about 3' high. :: ::The wood frame structure within these stone walls was constructed of a 2\\" x 4\\" frame with board and batten walls consisting of 1\\" x 12\\" boards and 4\\" battens. All fasteners are wire nails. Although the roof is no longer present, its shape is evident by the standing walls. It had a west-sloping shed roof that was about 7-1/2' high on the east and 6' high on the west. Some of the roof planks were still attached in 1999, but are no longer present. The entrance is on the south end of the east elevation and was 2-1/2'wide previously. :: ::There are window openings on the east ends of the north and south walls. Another smaller window opening is adjacent to the entry on the east wall. These openings do not contain any framing or glazing, although bits of window glass have been found on the ground below. Inside, a 1' x 1-1/2' metal box projects 6\\" through the north frame wall beneath the window and into the stone wall. It was once used as a small stove. Among the numerous names inscribed on the wooden walls are two dating from 1904: J. C. Reschke and J. E. Verna, members of Troop A under mine manager Captain Bulkeley Wells. Both names are inscribed on the rear inside roof beam. :: ::Originally constructed with the stone walls built up to the windows, this structure was used specifically as a guardhouse or sentry post that was manned by two to three soldiers. At the time of its use, the guardhouse had a telephone line to it.  Access  Panorama of Fort Peabody and Imogene PassLocated above the Imogene Pass summit (13,114 feet) on the Ouray/San Miguel County line, in the Uncompahgre National Forest, Fort Peabody can be accessed from Telluride, Colorado, via the Tomboy Road, a distance of 6.9 miles. The road requires high clearance and four-wheel-drive in the summer. The road is closed in the winter months, because of heavy snow. The historical site can also be approached from the Ouray side, via the Camp Bird Mine road, also a four-wheel-drive road. The USDA Forest Service forbids motorized vehicle access on the foot trail to the sentry post, in order to protect historical materials and the integrity of the site. The climb to the top of the ridge is 250 feet to the breathtaking altitude of 13,365 feet, where the historical Fort Peabody is situated.  Nomination to the National Register of Historic Places  The roofless shell of the CNG redoubt in 1998The USDA Forest Service acquired the Fort Peabody site from the Idarado Mining Company in 2002. Leigh Ann Hunt, archeologist for the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forests and the Forest Heritage Program Manager in 2004 said, \\"It is a miracle this [sentry post] survived to the present day.\\" Hunt said it was essential \\"to have its historical importance documented in the form of a National Register nomination\\" which would assist the USDA Forest Service in managing and protecting the site.\\" The site was surveyed and mapped by Jonathon C. Horn, Principal Investigator at Alpine Archaeological Consultants, Inc. of Montrose, Colorado in 2002. He identified cartridges from the site as consistent with those used by National Guard troops in 1904. Several different calibers were in use, and the .30-40 Krag cartridge with the \\"W.R.A. Co. 30 U.S.G\\" headstamp found at the site, indicated \\"that National Guard troops were using cast off U.S. military rifles,\\" according to Horn. In 2004 author and historian, MaryJoy Martin, researched, wrote, and presented the Fort Peabody nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Park Service approved her nomination, adding the site to the National Register on 30 March 2005. \\"Fort Peabody is probably the only remaining structure exclusively representative of Colorado's labor troubles in 1903-4,\\" Martin states. With the addition of Fort Peabody on the National Register, the Colorado Historical Society notes that \\"The site illustrates how quickly and often illegally mine owner management gained control of local government and the Colorado National Guard to run roughshod over the legal, political, and economic rights of union members.\\"  Stabilization and restoration  Initial stabilization of the Fort Peabody sentry post was completed in August 2004 under the direction of the USDA Forest Service, the crew consisting of historian MaryJoy Martin and three members of the Ouray County Historical Society, Don Paulson, George Moore, and Walt Rule. In June 2009 the Telluride Open Space and Recreation Program and San Miguel County Commissioner Art Goodtimes discussed signage and stabilization for the site, but difficult logistics threatened the project, since the site was above 13,000 feet in elevation. In 2010, a historic preservation project conducted by San Miguel County with authorization from and direction by the Grand Mesa, Uncompaghre, and Gunnison National Forest (GMUG) personnel was undertaken. During excavation of the site, the work crew found numerous ammunition shells, a silver hair pin, an old piece of newspaper, coal, leather pieces, glass fragments, and a fire poker. All artifacts were turned over to the USDA Forest Service. Stabilization and restoration of the historic Fort Peabody guardhouse was financed through San Miguel County's Open Space and Recreation Fund. \\"The Forest Service helped ensure that the steps outlined in the National Historic Preservation Act were followed, and that standards established by the Secretary of the Interior for stabilization work were adhered to throughout this complex project,\\" Leigh Anne Hunt of the USDA Forest Service states.

The plot loosely follows the origins and breakthrough success of the Original Dixieland Jass Band in New Orleans. It was well-received by critics on its release.Davis p.63-64 It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score. However, many of the songs, such as St. Louis Blues by W. C. Handy, were not new.Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub. Hal Leonard Corporation page 104 Plot Although he is only twelve, Jeff Lambert is a very talented clarinetist, and although the boy's father has spent a small fortune to have Jeff taught the fundamentals of classical clarinet, the lad prefers to spend his time in New Orleans with a group of black jazz men who perform in a dive on Bourbon Street. As the boy grows into manhood, his love for jazz intensifies, and he forms his own group, much to the chagrin of his aging father. Moving ahead, we find Jeff (Crosby) in his late twenties, and he and his boys have been unable to secure a job at any of the classier New Orleans cabarets and have been forced to limit their playing to street corners and to one-night stands in some of the dingier nightclubs. When his lead trombone player asks Jeff why the band can't seem to get anywhere, Jeff replies that he thinks the main problem is that the group lacks a hot trumpet player. He begins to search throughout New Orleans in the hope of finding a trumpet man who can fill the bill. He finds one in a local jail and promises to bail the fellow out as soon as he can raise the money. This he does, and the trumpet player, named Memphis (Brian Donlevy), agrees to become a member of Jeff's band. At the same time, Jeff notices a young lady called Betty Lou (Mary Martin) being overcharged by a horse-cab driver. He takes pity on her and her Aunt Phoebe (Carolyn Lee) and he invites them to stay with him. Memphis is attracted to Betty Lou and he gets her a job at a club owned by Blackie (J. Carrol Naish) and she agrees to the job if Blackie will take on Jeff's band and he reluctantly agrees to do so. With a great trumpet player, Jeff's band becomes the most popular jazz band on Bourbon Street. All goes well until they find out that the owner of the club, Blackie is a racketeer who uses his night spot only as a convenient front for his criminal interests. Jeff and the boys decide to leave Blackie's club and go on to other things, but when they tell Blackie of their plans, the gangster threatens to kill them one by one. Jeff takes a swing at Blackie, which causes a violent saloon brawl between Blackie and his gang and Jeff and his boys. During the fight, Jeff's good friend Louey (Eddie \\"Rochester\\" Anderson) is injured when he is cracked over the head with a bottle. When the riot is over, Jeff and the boys take the unconscious Louey home to his wife, Ruby (Ruby Elzy). As she tearfully bemoans her husband's injury, Jeff and the band play a moving musical tribute to their fallen comrade. Slowly Louey regains consciousness. A few weeks later, Jeff and his band have still another unpleasant run-in with Blackie. This time, the gangster is accidentally killed by one of his own henchmen, leaving Jeff, Betty Lou, and the band to move on to better things.

The reviews were positive with Bosley Crowther of the New York Times commenting: \\"The Paramount has got a nice picture to greet the holidays... On the basis of story alone, ‚ÄúBirth of the Blues‚Äù rates a less-than-passing grade. But as a series of illustrated jam sessions and nifty presentations of songs and jokes it is as pleasant an hour-and-a-half killer as the musically inclined could wish. Not only does feckless Bing Crosby play the clarinetist in his best unpremeditated vein, but he also has Mary Martin, Brian Donlevy, Eddie (Rochester) Anderson and Jack Teagarden with his orchestra to abet him. And although they give the impression of improvising, more or less, as they go, Director Victor Schertzinger has given to their sauntering a very smooth, easy-going pace. . . For sweet and fancy singing that makes your muscles twitch, there is Mr. Crosby and Miss Martin doing truly delightful things with ‚ÄúWait Till the Sun Shines, Nellie‚Äù and a new number, ‚ÄúThe Waiter, the Porter and the Upstairs Maid.‚Äù And for dipping deep on the low chords, you can‚Äôt ask for anything more than Mr. Crosby‚Äôs ‚ÄòMelancholy Baby‚Äô and those mournful ‚ÄòSt .Louis Blues,‚Äô sung by one Ruby Elzy, with the Teagarden band moaning behind. Obviously, this little picture is not the ultimate saga of early jazz. But it begins to perceive the possibilities. As the ‚Äúcats‚Äù say, it takes more than it leaves.\\" Variety summed it up saying: \\"‚ÄòBirth of the Blues‚Äô is Bing Crosby‚Äôs best filmusical to date.

Among its details are decorations over the entryway and its stone lintels. The first residents of 209 Second were the family of John B. Allen, a state representative. A three-story brick building constructed around 1881, it features an elaborate bracketed front porch, three corbelled chimneys, and a two-story side porch. Abraham Hivling erected 235 Second around 1840. Three stories tall, it features a large front and side porch with an entablature and pillars. Visitors enter through a grand door with sidelights and transom. The interior is divided into forty-two rooms: ten in the basement and thirty-two in the rest of the house. Known as \\"Eden Hall\\", this house was later purchased by John Allen and his wife and given to their daughter and son-in-law, Mary and Coates Kinney. A later owner, Evelyn Cozatt, used the property to house a huge antique collection. In the 2000s, it was opened as a bed and breakfast. As of May 2017, it has reverted to a private home.

His house is a weatherboarded 2¬Ω-story structure in the Queen Anne style; it features an asymmetrical floor plan and multiple large gables. Sidelights and a transom surround the recessed main entrance, and a screened porch is accessible from the second floor. Preservation In March 1973, the houses at 209 and 235 Second were designated the East Second Street District and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and six years later the district was expanded to include part of the 100 block and most of the 200 block. The neighborhood was judged important because of its ability to depict wealthy Gilded Age society and because of the high degree of preservation that the houses had experienced. Its integrity has diminished since 1979; although it was previously a good example of period architecture, the district has seen unsympathetic changes to and insufficient maintenance of some of its houses.

It begins at about above sea level near Mink Lake in the Three Sisters Wilderness of the Cascade Range. Flowing northwest within Lane County, it meets the McKenzie River about from the larger river's confluence with the Willamette River. Map quadrangles show river mileage for the entire length of the McKenzie River. About from the South Fork mouth, Cougar Dam impounds water from the river to create Cougar Reservoir. It is a multipurpose United States Army Corps of Engineers project built in 1963 to generate hydroelectricity and limit flooding. The watershed offers many opportunities for recreation, including fishing, swimming, hiking, and camping. Motorized boating is allowed on Cougar Reservoir, which is used for waterskiing. A popular hot springs is along a tributary near the reservoir. Whitewater enthusiasts sometimes run a difficult stretch of the upper river. Course The South Fork McKenzie River begins in the Mink Lake Basin of the Cascade Range at an elevation of about above sea level. Lakes near the river's headwaters include Mink, Porky, Mud, Plumb, Goose, and Corner, as well as many smaller water bodies. Flowing west through the Three Sisters Wilderness of the Willamette National Forest, the river receives Elk Creek from the left at river mile (RM) 25 or river kilometer (RK) 40\\\\. About further downstream, the river leaves the wilderness. The river passes Frissel Crossing Campground, which is on the left, about from the mouth. Slightly downstream of the campground, the South Fork passes under Forest Road 19 (Aufderheide Drive), which then runs parallel to the river along its right bank, and Roaring River enters from the left. Over the next stretch, Fir and Cascade creeks enter from the right. The Homestead Campground is on the right at about RM 18 (RK 29), and here the river turns northwest and then north. Augusta Creek enters from the left about later at Dutch Oven Campground. Over the next stretch, Starr and Blue creeks enter from the left and Trail and Rebel creeks from the right. Hardy and Balm creeks enter from the left about from the mouth. Below this, the river reaches French Pete Campground, which is on the right, and receives Horn and Penny creeks from the left before arriving at a United States Geological Survey stream gauge near the mouth of Tipsoo Creek, at about RM 10 (RK 16). Just beyond the gauge, the river enters Cougar Reservoir, receiving Ridge Creek from the left and passing Cougar Crossing Campground, which is on the right. Here the river passes under Forest Road 19, which continues to parallel the South Fork but along its left bank. Shortly thereafter, Smith Creek enters from the right near Sunnyside Campground, and then Slide Creek enters from the right near Slide Creek Campground and its boat ramp. Rider Creek enters from the left at RM 8 (RK 13), and Boone Creek enters from the left a fraction of a mile later. In the next stretch of the reservoir, Annie and Basalt creeks enter from the left and Walker Creek from the right before the river receives the East Fork South Fork McKenzie River from the right about from the South Fork mouth. A fraction of a mile below this, Rush Creek enters from the left, and the river reaches Cougar Dam and power plant. Another stream gauge is beyond the dam, at about RM 4 (RK 6). Along this stretch, a county road linking the dam to Oregon Route 126 is on the river's right bank, while Forest Road 19 is on the left. In its last stretch, the river passes again under Forest Road 19, which merges with the dam road. The South Fork turns west and meanders another mile or so, passing the Delta Campground, which is on its right, and entering the McKenzie River main stem about from its confluence with the Willamette River. Recreation Cougar Dam on the South Fork Fishing, camping, hiking, swimming, and boating are among the forms of recreation pursued in the South Fork McKenzie River watershed. Cougar Reservoir is used for motorized boating, fishing, swimming, and waterskiing. The United States Forest Service maintains three campgrounds --Cougar Crossing, Slide Creek, and Sunnyside--near the reservoir, with opportunities for hiking and picnicking as well as camping. Other campgrounds in the general vicinity of the reservoir include French Pete and Delta. Cougar Reservoir supports populations of stocked rainbow trout and stocked landlocked Chinook salmon as well as naturally reproducing cutthroat trout. The lake also supports bull trout, but it is not legal to catch and keep them. Catch-and- release fishing for cutthroat and bull trout is popular on the upper river and its tributaries.Sheehan, p. 153 Fish on the upper river are numerous but relatively small, averaging . Terwilliger Hot Springs, near the confluence of Rider Creek and the South Fork, offers six clothing-optional soaking pools in sight of a waterfall and \\"a spectacular rock formation\\". The popular hot springs, with a parking lot off Forest Road 19, requires a day-use pass that can be paid for on-site. Whitewater enthusiasts sometimes run all or part of an stretch of the river from above French Pete Campground to Cougar Reservoir.

She had been renamed Ro-102 by the time she was launched on 17 April 1942. She was completed and commissioned on 17 November 1942. Service history Upon commissioning, Ro-102 was attached to the Yokosuka Naval District and was assigned to the Kure Submarine Squadron for workups. On 16 January 1943, she was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 7 in the 8th Fleet. She departed Yokosuka, Japan, on 25 January 1943, called at Truk from 8 to 11 February 1943, and arrived at Rabaul on New Britain on 15 February 1943. First war patrol Ro-102 got underway from Rabaul on 22 February 1943 for her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area south of New Guinea. The patrol was uneventful, and she returned to Rabaul on 15 March 1943.

Third war patrol On 29 April 1943, Ro-102 departed Rabaul to begin her third war patrol, bound for a patrol area southeast of Rabi, New Guinea, which she reached on 2 May 1943. She transmitted a message on 9 May 1943 from a position south of New Guinea reporting a lack of enemy activity in the area. The Japanese never heard from her again. On 15 May 1943, Ro-102 was ordered to return to Rabaul, but she did not acknowledge receipt of the order. Loss The circumstances of Ro-102‚Ä≤s loss remain a mystery. Some historians claim that the United States Navy destroyer sank her off San Cristobal in the southeastern Solomon Islands on 11 February 1943, but Ro-102 was active after that date, and the submarine Fletcher sank was . Other historians credit the U.S. Navy PT boats PT-150 and PT-152 with sinking Ro-102 off Lae, New Guinea, on the night of 13‚Äì14 May 1943, but the PT boats actually attacked the submarine that night, and I-6 survived. On 2 June 1943, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared Ro-102 to be presumed lost south of Rabi with all 42 men on board. The Japanese struck her from the Navy list on 15 July 1943.

History In 1996, six boats on moorings near the Barrachois Harbour Fishermen's wharf, about 200 yards west of where the marina is now located, formed Barrachois Harbour Yacht Club. BHYC's home, Sunrise Shore Marina (formerly Barrachois Marina), was opened 6 July 1997 by Dana and Mary Hunter of nearby Lower Waugh's River. The original capacity of the marina was 64 slips with all floating docks and finger piers, as well being the only source of dockside gasoline on the north shore of Nova Scotia between the New Brunswick border and Pictou. The Marina has since proven itself over the years to be an excellent \\"hurricane hole\\", in particular during Hurricane Gustav (2002) and Hurricane Juan (2003). No damage to the marina or berthed BHYC vessels was inflicted by either storm, despite an approximately 8' storm surge from Gustav and winds over 80 knots (148km/h) from Juan.

It lies at a distance of 50 million light-years (15.5 mega parsecs) from the Milky Way and is a member of the Virgo Cluster.  Physical characteristics  While NGC 4550 is not one of the brightest galaxies of the Virgo Cluster, it is notable as it is one of the few galaxies where a large amount of its stars rotate around the galaxy's center in opposite direction to the others* About her research article on this galaxy, Vera Rubin wrote: \\"I discovered from observations of NGC 4550 that in the single disk of this galaxy, half the stars orbit clockwise, and half the stars orbit counterclockwise, both systems intermingled. This observation required that many astronomers modify the manner in which they measured velocities, for computer programs were not then equipped to handle such complexity.\\" She mentions and takes pleasure in the fact that the discovery was made at age 63. Another, brighter, example is the spiral galaxy NGC 7217. The stars of this galaxy are concentrated in two disks of similar size and surface brightness, one nested within the other and it has been suggested it's the product of the merger between two previous disk galaxies, each one counter-rotating with respect to the other. NGC 4550's center also shows a small amount of molecular hydrogen and interstellar dust, the latter concentrated in a disk surrounding its core where star formation is taking place albeit at a very modest level.

The park is a walk-in facility, open for hunting and trout fishing, managed by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. History The park's name may derive from a once-present beaver pond. It was one of multiple public recreation areas acquired in the 1950s using funds bequeathed for that purpose by George Dudley Seymour. When the gift was announced in 1955, it was reported that trout pools had already been developed north of Bibbins Pond. The annually produced State Register and Manual noted the park's acreage at 165 acres in 1955, at 391 acres in 1957, and at 401 acres in 1960. The state record for brook trout was claimed for Bibbins Pond from 1994 to 1998. Activities and amenities Bibbins Pond, known as Beaver Brook Pond, is the park's central feature, while Beaver Brook runs both north and south of the pond and continues beyond the park limits. Bibbins Pond's offer a seasonal boat launch for non-motorized watercraft and trout fishing. The park also includes a geocache which can be accessed via three different routes.

In 1843 he received from the Towanda Bank a trust of landed interests in the then small town of Chicago, and in two years he not only fulfilled this mission successfully, but realized handsome profits in Chicago real estate for himself. In 1863 he engaged actively in developing the petroleum interests of Pennsylvania. In 1870, as director and afterward as president, he undertook the work of pushing the Northern Pacific Railroad to completion. After the road had been built to the Missouri River, and eastward from the Pacific Ocean about 100 miles, Jay Cooke and Co., the fiscal agents, failed during the Panic of 1873, and the completed parts were not paying expenses. Wright afterward assisted in the reorganization by which the road was completed to Puget Sound. Wright served as president of the Northern Pacific from 1875 until 1879, and was instrumental in deciding on Tacoma as its western terminus. In 1873 he took an active part in founding the city of Tacoma, Washington. There he endowed the Annie Wright Seminary for girls (named for his daughter),DEATH OF FORMER TACOMA RESIDENT, in the Tacoma Times; published May 17, 1904 (via Chronicling America) and Washington College for boys, and was noted for his generosity to young men.

Two common varieties of fragmentation are market fragmentation and version fragmentation. Fragmentation is the opposite of, and is solved by standardization. Market fragmentation Market fragmentation happens when multiple competing firms offer highly-incompatible technologies or technology stacks, likely leading to vendor lock-in. Version fragmentation Version fragmentation happens when a firm offers multiple incompatible versions or variations of a single product, either in tandem or over time as a result of accumulated changes to product specification. Android and iOS operating systems A term being used in the Android development community is Android fragmentation.What is Android fragmentation Fragmentation within Android is when a variety of versions of the Android platform, combined with a mixture of hardware result in the inability for some devices to properly run certain applications. Despite Google upgrading its Android operating system to version 4.4, also known as KitKat, users continued to use the earlier versions of the operating system, primarily Gingerbread (that's down to 0.3% share). The cause is primarily because hardware manufacturers of the devices are not able to upgrade to the later operating system for a number of reasons. As a result, applications written for one version will not operate consistently on the other, and vice versa.Google targets Android fragmentation with updated terms for SDK In August 2010, developers of the OpenSignal wireless crowd-sourcing app detected 3,997 distinct values for \\"android.build.MODEL\\" among users of their app. This variable represents the device model, though it may be altered by adding a custom ROM. OpenSignal acknowledged that while this made it problematic to develop apps, the wide variety of models allows Android to enter more markets. Developers have placed the blame on Google and the hardware manufacturers, while Google has blamed software developers for not staying within the guidelines of its terms and conditions. The issue with fragmentation has forced Google to add a prohibition to its terms and conditions for its software development kit, which developers must accept before developing for the Android operating system. For example, OpenSignal and Testdroid studies have found out that OEMs fragment Android ecosystem significantly more than Google.

It served the neighbourhoods of Padi, Villivakkam, Korattur and Anna Nagar. The station is located at the junction of 100-feet Inner Ring Road‚ÄîMTH Road, known as the Padi Junction. The station is being maintained by the Integral Coach Factory (ICF), the premier production unit of the Indian railways. History In 2003, a 3.09 km-long railway line, initially used by the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) at Perambur for moving newly built coaches from shell to furnishing division of the factory, was strengthened at a cost of 72.9 million for operating passenger services. Two new stations, namely, Padi and Anna Nagar, were built and 13 existing bridges were renovated and the work was completed in five months. The railway station and the EMU services were inaugurated by the then Union Minister of State for Railways, A. K. Moorthy. Between 2003 and 2007, five suburban trains were being run from Anna Nagar to Chennai Beach via Villivakkam. In 2007, the service was discontinued due to construction of a rotary at the Padi junction replacing the level-crossing. Though the rotary was completed in 2009, services were not restored. However, in 2011, the railways planned to resume services in this section as a feeder service with six-car EMUs. The tracks and land on which the station is built were originally owned by the ICF. When the Southern Railway intended to operate trains to Padi and Anna Nagar stations, the ICF handed over the land to the Southern Railway. When the train services were withdrawn in 2007, the ICF reclaimed the land from the zonal railway. The tracks and the stations are now used by the ICF for moving spare parts to the manufacturing unit and back. Patronage The service during its operational years, however, had a low patronage. However, unlike the rest of the Chennai Suburban Railway network, there is only one line in this section. In addition, the traffic congestion resulting due to closure of a gate near the Padi railway station limited the operation to five pairs of EMU services between Chennai Beach and Anna Nagar. Upgradations Additional lines Three separate tracks, each 500 meters long and accommodating 20 coaches, are being built on the northern side of the station. These lines will be used to park new coaches built by the ICF until they are transported to their destinations. A 2-km long high-speed rail line between the station and the ICF will also be laid at the station for conducting trials. The lines will be used to test semi-high speed coaches running up to 160 km per hour. Conversion to social hub In 2018, the ICF began to convert the defunct station into a social meeting point by building a 500-meter walkers‚Äô path at a cost of 1.5 million and providing seating arrangements, lightings, security and other amenities. It also planted about 300 saplings at the station. The meeting hub will cater to people from nearby residential areas such as Villivakkam, Padi, Korattur and Anna Nagar. The residents are allowed in the station premises both in the morning and in the evening. The overall cost of the project was 29 million, funded by the general funds of the ICF.

The book was first published in 1913 by David Nutt in London, with a dedication to Frost's wife, Elinor. Its first American edition would come two years later, in 1915, through Henry Holt and Company. Like much of Frost's work, the poems in A Boy's Will thematically associate with rural life, nature, philosophy, and individuality, while also alluding to earlier poets including Emily Dickinson, Thomas Hardy, William Shakespeare, and William Wordsworth.Fagan, Deirdre. 2007. Critical Companion to Robert Frost: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work. New York: Facts on File . Despite the first section of poems having a theme of retreating from society, then, Frost does not retreat from his literary precursors and, instead, tries to find his place among them.Richardson, Mark. The Ordeal of Robert Frost: The Poet and His Poetics. University of Illinois Press, 1997: 105‚Äì106. Background Frost admitted that much of the book is autobiographical. As the proof sheets were printed in January 1913, he wrote that the poems were \\"pretty near being the story of five years\\" of his life. Specifically, Frost noted that the first poem of the book, \\"Into My Own\\", expresses how he turned away from people, and \\"Tuft of Flowers\\" shows how he \\"came back to them.\\" In fact, some of the poems were written as early as two decades earlier.Kendall, Tim. 2012. The Art of Robert Frost. Yale University Press.. . Frost was apparently pleased with the book and wrote to a friend shortly after its publication, \\"I expect to do something to the present state of literature in America.\\"Kilcup, Karen L. 1998. Robert Frost and Feminine Literary Tradition. University of Michigan Press. p. 89. The title of the book comes from the repeated lines in the poem \\"My Lost Youth\\" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow:Parini, Jay. 1999. Robert Frost: A Life. New York: Henry Holt and Company, LLC. . The line is, in turn, a quote from Olaus Sirma in Lapponia (1675).Hatfield, James Taft. \\"Longfellow's Lappland Song\\" in PMLA. Vol. 45, No. 4 (December 1930): 1188‚Äì1192 Frost likely chose the title as a reflection of his own wayward early life. Publication history and response Robert Frost in 1913 Most of the poems in A Boy's Will had never been published previously. While in England, Frost determined to have them collected, and his manuscript was accepted by the first publisher he approached. The book was published by David Nutt of London in 1913, with a dedication to Frost's wife Elinor, who had assisted in choosing the poems and arranging the order for publication. As it was being published, Frost met with fellow writer Ezra Pound, who insisted they immediately go to Nutt to see a copy of the book in print. Pound offered to write a review that day and soon introduced Frost to poet William Butler Yeats. Yeats said he considered A Boy's Will \\"the best poetry written in America in a long time.\\"Shuman, R. Baird Great American Writers: Twentieth Century. Marshall Cavendish, In his September 1913 review in the New Freeman, Pound noted: \\"The man has the good sense to speak naturally and to paint the thing, the thing as he sees it. And to do this is a very different matter from gunning about for the circumplectious polysyllable.\\"Hoffman, Tyler. 2001. Robert Frost and the Politics of Poetry. Hanover, NH: Middlebury College Press. . F. S. Flint was particularly pleased with the individual poems using one specific theme each, allowing \\"direct observation of the object and immediate correlation with the emotion‚Äîspontaneity, subtlety in the evocation of moods, humor\\" and praised Frost's \\"ear for silences.\\" Poet Richard Aldington would similarly praise Frost's \\"directness of treatment\\" and \\"simplicity of speech\\" in North of Boston. Lascelles Abercrombie, however, warned that the simplicity of Frost's language did not imply simplicity in his poetry and in A Boy's Will, he believed \\"the selection and arrangement of the substance do practically everything.\\" William Morton Payne also noted there was further complexity within the seeming simplicity of the book, writing for The Dial in 1913, \\"A dream world of elusive shapes and tremulous imaginings is half revealed to our vision by the subdued lyrics which Mr. Robert Frost entitles 'A Boy's Will'.\\"Diepeveen, Leonard. 2003. The Difficulties of Modernism. New York: Routledge. p. 186. The youth of the author, however, was apparent to at least one anonymous critic who wrote in a September 20, 1913, review, \\"We do not need to be told that the poet is a young man: the dew and the ecstasy ‚Äî the audacity, too ‚Äî of pristine vision are here.\\" Overall, the book (or collection as some may call it) was widely well-received and positively reviewed. Following the success of North of Boston in 1914, Henry Holt and Company republished A Boy's Will in 1915, becoming the first edition of the book published in the United States.

He was the younger brother of Tsugunobu, and their father was the ≈åsh≈´ Fujiwara retainer Sat≈ç Motoharu. Tsugunobu and his brother Tadanobu \\"were 'given' to Yoshitsune by Fujiwara no Hidehira when Yoshitsune left Oshu to join Yoritomo.\\" Yoshitsune's retreat Sat≈ç is most well known for saving his master Yoshitsune's life at Yoshino, a story recorded in the Gikeiki. The story has become somewhat legendary over the years. Whilst travelling to Kyushu to escape from the troops of his brother Yoritomo, Yoshitsune and his forces were beset by the monks of Zo-o-no, and were facing defeat. Sat≈ç volunteered to fight a rearguard action to allow Yoshitsune time to reach safety, and asked for the loan of his master's armour in order to convince the pursuing troops that Yoshitsune was still within their grasp. (This was not an entirely selfless act, since Yoshitsune's armour would have been of better quality than Sat≈ç's, and would have afforded better protection.) Disguised as Yoshitsune, Sat≈ç challenged and fought the group's pursuers, killing or wounding around twenty men. His companions were killed, but Sat≈ç evaded capture and proceeded to Kyoto. In Kyoto he stayed at the house of a woman acquaintance, but was discovered and attacked. Under threat of capture, he committed seppuku. His widow, Kaede, along with her sister-in-law Wakazakura, attempted to comfort his grieving mother by presenting herself wearing her late husband's armour. \\"Goban\\" Tadanobu A popular story regarding Sat≈ç Tadanobu's death involves him being attacked whilst playing a game of go.

This episode has been a popular theme in ukiyo prints, and has also inspired kabuki plays such as Yoshino Shizuka Goban Tadanobu and Yoshitsune Senbon Zakura, and the ko-jururi play Goban Tadanobu. In many of these plays, the Tadanobu character is implied to be a fox spirit (\\"Genkur≈ç\\"), due to his impersonation of Yoshitsune (in Japan, foxes were believed to be shape-shifters).

This synagogue is one of the only 2 synagogues that remain active to this day in Bulgaria (with the Sofia Synagogue). History According to the archaeological research a Synagogue had been constructed in ancient Philippopolis dating back to the reign of Emperor Alexander Severus in the first half of 3rd century AD. It is followed by several renovations, the last one ‚Äì from the beginning of 5th century (M. Martinova). In 1360, when the city was conquered by the Turks certain Jews who emigrated from Aragon in 1492 settled in Philippopolis and built a synagogue called \\"K. K. Aragon,\\" which was standing in 1540, but is no longer in existence. In 1892 following Bulgaria liberation from Ottoman domination in 1878 one of the first synagogues to be erected was the (Zion) Synagogue in Plovdiv. It was built in the remnants of a small courtyard in what was once a large Jewish quarter called Orta Mezar during the Turkish rule. The location of the Sephardic synagogue is now called Tsar Kaloyan Street 13. Before the Second World War, the Jewish quarter had a population of 7000. The Synagogue is one of the best- preserved examples of the so-called \\"Ottoman-style\\" synagogues in the Balkans. According to author Ruth E. Gruber, the interior is a \\"hidden treasure‚Ä¶a glorious, if run-down, burst of color.\\" An exquisite Venetian glass chandelier hangs from the center of the ceiling, which has a richly painted dome. All surfaces are covered in elaborate, Moorish-style, geometric designs in once- bright greens and blues. Torah scrolls are kept in the gilded Aron-ha-Kodesh. In 1904 the Jewish community possessed three other synagogues: Jeshurun, built in 1710 according to the inscription on a marble slab in the synagogue; Ahabat-Shalom, built in 1880; Shebe·π≠ A·∏•im or Maf·π≠irim, founded in 1882 by emigrants from Karlovo, whence the Jews fled during the Turko-Russian war (1877-1878). Rabbis Since the end of the eighteenth century the following have been chief rabbis of the city: * Abraham Sidi (according to Zedner, l.c. p. 397, \\"Sa'id\\"; 1790-1810); * Judah Sidi (1810‚Äì12), brother of the preceding, and author of Ot Emet, on the laws relating to reading the Torah, Salonica, 1799; and of Ner Mi·∫ìwah, on Maimonides' Yad and his Sefer ha- Mi·∫ìwot, with indexes to the hermeneutic works of Solomon and Israel Jacob Algazi, ib. 1810-11; * Abraham ibn Aroglio (1812‚Äì19); * Abraham Ventura (1823‚Äì29); * Moses ha-Levi (1830‚Äì32); * Jacob Finzi (1832‚Äì33); * ·∏§ayyim ibn Aroglio (1833‚Äì57), with Abraham ibn Aroglio joint author of Mayim ha-·∏§ayyim, responsa, Salonica, 1846; * Moses Behmoiras (1857‚Äì76); ·∏§ayyim Meborah (1876-92); * Ezra Benaroyo who has held office since 1892. * Shmuel Behar Legacy Nowadays, the Jewish community in Bulgaria is very small (863 in 1994) because of the Holocaust, secularity of the local Jewish population due to many years of communism and subsequent Aliya (Jewish immigration to Israel). In 1994 the synagogue was mostly inactive. but the community is undergoing a revival In 2003 the synagogue was restored. The city's mayor, the U.S. and Israeli ambassadors to Bulgaria, were present at its inauguration. The funding for the restoration of the 19th-century Zion Synagogue. was raised by the U.S. Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad (US$26,000) and the London-based Hanadiv Charitable Foundation. The Plovdiv synagogue is open on Friday night services and on High Holidays. Zion synagogue is also available for guests during the day only after a prescheduled visit made from the temple's website. The synagogue hosts various events connected with the cultural and educational program of the city. A permanent exhibition about the Jewish life in the city and the region will soon be created and it will present different objects and stories from the community in Plovdiv and Bulgaria.

Early career and background The son of an Anglican priest, Fleming graduated with a B.A. from the University of Adelaide, a Licentiate in Theology from the Australian College of Theology and a Ph.D. in philosophy and bioethics from Griffith University. His Ph.D. thesis was titled \\"Human rights and natural law : an analysis of the consensus gentium and its implications for bioethics\\". Career Fleming was a high-profile Anglo- Catholic priest in the Anglican Church of Australia's Adelaide diocese. He was ordained in 1970. He became a Roman Catholic in 1987. Although married with three children, he was given a papal dispensation permitting his ordination in the Catholic Church in 1995. As an Anglican priest in the early 1970s he served as university chaplain and priest in charge of St Paul's Church in Adelaide and dean and vice-master of St Mark's College at the University of Adelaide. Between 1977 and 1978 he was assistant curate at St. Nicholas Church, Chiswick, in West London; and between 1978 and 1987 was the rector of the Church of the Good Shepherd, Plympton. As a Roman Catholic lay person, between 1987 and 1995, he was the founding director of Southern Cross Bioethics Institute. As a Roman Catholic priest, Fleming was director of the Southern Cross Bioethics Institute between 1995 and 2004; and from 2001, a faculty member of the John Paul II Institute for Marriage and Family. He served as the founding president of Campion College between 2004 and 2009. He was an Adjunct Professor of Bioethics at the Southern Cross Bioethics Institute, until its closure in 2012. He has served on a number of bioethics boards including as a foundation member of UNESCO's International Bioethics Committee (1992-1996); and between 13 July 1996 and 13 July 2016, a corresponding member of the Pontifical Academy for Life.

Fleming was a weekly columnist of The Advertiser in Adelaide and presented radio programs for a number of years. In 2005, while the president of Campion College in Sydney, Fleming hosted a short-lived talkback radio program on 2UE. Community Fleming was an elected delegate to the 1998 Australian Constitutional Convention associated with Australians for Constitutional Monarchy. In 2003, he was appointed by the Howard Government to the council of the National Museum of Australia with his term ending in 2009. Personal Fleming is married to Alison and they have three children. Allegations of abuse Subsequent to his appointment to Campion College, media reports were published alleging sexual impropriety by Fleming with a number of people when he was an Anglican priest. It was stated that the allegations were known to the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Adelaide, the Most Reverend Leonard Faulkner, at the time of his Roman Catholic ordination in 1995 and thus also at the time of his appointment to Campion College in 2004. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Adelaide reinstated Fleming as a priest in 2011 and he initiated a defamation case against the Sunday Mail in regard to a number of stories published on the complaints and investigations. In December 2012 the investigations into these allegations had not been finalised. The case commenced 7 October 2014.Courts Administration Authority of South Australia, Civil Lists Between 2014 and 2016, he pursued a high profile, but unsuccessful, defamation action against The Advertiser and Sunday Mail in the Supreme Court of South Australia regarding reports of alleged sexual misconduct as an Anglican priest. On 24 February 2016, Fleming lost his defamation case against The Advertiser and Sunday Mail regarding articles alleging sexual misconduct.The case was heard under the civil law jurisdiction under the South Australian Defamation Act of 2005. The Supreme Court of South Australia ruled 'the articles truthfully conveyed imputations that Fr Fleming was engaged in \\"sexual misconduct, predatory sexual behaviour, morally reprehensible and deceitful conduct, an immoral, adulterous, homosexual affair, hypocrisy, abuse of trust, moral cowardice and false denial of sexual involvement.\\"' with costs awarded against him. Fleming appealed against the dismissal of the claim for damages for defamation to the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia. On 29 September 2016 this appeal was unanimously dismissed when the Full Court found no errors of law were made in the earlier judgement. Costs were awarded against him. Fleming lodged an application for special leave to appeal with the High Court of Australia, the application was refused as it did 'not raise a question of general importance. None of the applicant's proposed appeal grounds enjoys sufficient prospects of success to warrant a grant of special leave. Special leave should be refused with costs.' It was decreed under canon law on 9 February 2017 by Philip Marshall, Vicar General of the Catholic Archdiocese of Adelaide, that Fleming was to immediately cease all forms of ministry.

The earthworks are located on opposite sides of the creek: the Pollock Works on the southern side, and the Williamson Mound approximately 100 rods (1650 feet, or 500 meters) away on the northern side.Squier, Ephraim G., and Edwin H. Davis. Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, 1848. Williamson Mound Williamson Mound from the south The Williamson Mound is a large mound in a field near Massies Creek. In 1881, it was described as being \\"about forty feet high and one hundred and fifty [twelve and forty-two meters] in circumference. It is perfectly oval in form, and has on its surface trees of a century's growth, denoting that the mound is very old. From its summit can be seen a distance of several miles in every direction.\\" Its construction was attributed to the mysterious Mound Builders of old, who surely constructed it as a watchtower from which to observe enemies from afar. Local residents are believed to have dug around the mound around the turn of the twentieth century, but little damage appears to have been done. In the early 1970s, its dimensions were reported as being in diameter by in height; its decrease in height may have been the result of differing measurements, as in 1848, the Greene County surveyor had reported its measurements as . More recent archaeological studies of the site have concluded that it was constructed as a burial mound by people of the Adena culture in the final centuries before Christ. While the mound has never been scientifically excavated, its great size suggests that its construction took place over an extended period of time, leading archaeologists to conclude that it may contain evidence of multiple stages of Adena society as well as in the mortuary traditions practiced on those buried in the mound. Pollock Works One of the gateways to the Pollock Works The Pollock Works occupy a high promontory above the southern side of Massies Creek: both the northern and southern sides are the steep limestone walls, here averaging in height, from which the name of \\"Cliffs\\" was derived. Although occasional fissures pierce the cliff, permitting access through the old creek channel on the promontory's southern side, only via an isthmus on the western side is the promontory easily accessible, due to its gentle slope. The area of the promontory is approximately . Across the isthmus are the remnants of small crescent-shaped earthworks and an artificial wall, which in the 1840s measured thick at the base and high; it is pierced by three small gateways, at each of which was originally located a stone mound. Due to its comparatively inaccessible location, Squier and Davis proposed in their Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley that the site was a fortification at which a simple palisade could render the promontory impregnable. The works were discovered soon after Greene County was settled in the early nineteenth century and first made known to outsiders by Squier and Davis. In the 1910s, they were believed to have been the work of the Fort Ancient people, who were \\"totally different from the higher culture [Hopewell] of the Scioto valley\\", and who would in times of danger retreat to the isolated Fort Ancient site. It was one of eighty-four archaeological sites observed in 1914 by William C. Mills' countywide archaeological survey, which deemed the Pollock Works the county's premier site.Mills, William C. Archeological Atlas of Ohio. Columbus: Ohio State Archeological and Historical Society, 1914, 29. Scientific excavations under a Wright State University archaeologist have demonstrated that the Pollock Works were built by the Hopewell in a five-stage process that started in the first century after Christ. It appears that Squier and Davis correctly ascertained the defensive capabilities of the site; at some point in its history, a palisade stretched across the isthmus, although it was destroyed by fire and later buried by a fresh layer of earth. Although the site was seemingly employed as a hill fort for part of its history,Pollock Works, Ohio Historical Society, 2006-12-04. Accessed 2012-12-24. it appears to have been a religious location and one of numerous Hopewell hilltop ceremonial sites. Preservation Indian Mound Reserve is actively managed by the Greene County Parks, which promotes the beauty of the creek canyon and the history of the earthworks. The archaeological importance of the reserve forms the basis for programs educating elementary-school children about archaeology. Williamson Mound was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in December 1971 ‚Äî becoming Greene County's first site on the Register aside from Huffman Prairie, where the Wright brothers learned to fly ‚Äî and the Pollock Works followed two months later.

His countrymen know Rushaka as the \\"Tanzanian Dolphin,\\" for his legendary abilities in the water. \\"The remarkable story of how he learnt to swim and rose to fame is legendary. His father, Yahya Rushaka, was one of the sole survivors of the Mv Bukoba ferry disaster on Lake Victoria in 1996 that claimed a thousand lives. It was his father who encouraged Khalid to learn to swim from the stories he used to tell of the brave men who saved many lives because they could swim. His father inspired him to pursue a career in swimming. Rushaka coached himself with the help of youtube videos. He progressed quickly through the ranks and the Tanzianian Olympic Committee chose him to represent the nation. He specialized in sprint freestyle events. Rushaka represented Tanzania at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where he competed for the men's 50 m freestyle. He finished third in the third heat by forty-five hundredths of a second (0.45) ahead of 13-year- old Seychellois swimmer Dwayne Didon, with a time of 28.50 seconds. Rushaka, however, failed to advance into the semi-finals by 6.37 seconds, as he placed eighty-fourth out of ninety-seven swimmers in the overall rankings. In 2016, ISR (International Sports Relations) Academy awarded Rushaka with a scholarship to study sports management in Busan, South Korea. The ISR Academy was the brainchild of the Olympic champion and IOC member Mood Dae Sung. He created the Organization to offer \\"free academic training to retiring or recently retired Olympians who are interested in furthering their careers in the field of international sports business and administration.\\" Rushaka entered the second class of ISR under the directorship of Adam Pengilly, ex- Olympian and a member of the IOC. Rushaka was classmates with Ukrainian middle-distance star Olha Zavhorodnya, Estonian archer Siret Luik, South African wrestler Mpho \\"Queen of the Ring\\" Madi, and Brazilian bobsledder Fabiana Dos Santos. Since returning to Tanzania, Rushaka has committed himself to building Tanzania's Olympic swimming program. He coaches promising Tanzanians at International School of Moshi Arusha Campus. He also started Arusha Swim Club with the aim of accommodating more upcoming Tanzanians who didn't have the opportunity to study in International Schools where swimming is taken as part of the school curriculum. He is also the Founder and CEO of Sports Network Tanzania.

Background  Following the invasion of Kamerun after the outbreak of war between Germany and the Allies, the main military objective of France and Britain was to seize control of the colony's coast to ensure that additional men and supplies could not reach the German forces there. By mid-September 1914, British and French naval vessels had effectively blockaded the Wouri estuary and the main port of Douala. On 21 September, the French gunboat, Surprise which had escorted French soldiers from Libreville, appeared before the village of Ukoko in southern Neukamerun. This town had a small German garrison and French forces wished to occupy it. The French vessel shelled the town and destroyed much of it.\\"Verteidigung Ukokos\\".  Landings and battle  Following the shelling, four boats carrying French soldiers and machine guns were launched from the Surprise in an attempt to take Ukoko. The small force, under the command of Colonel Miquelard, landed on the beach but encountered fire from German units who had entrenched themselves on higher ground. Later in the afternoon, nine more boatloads of French soldiers arrived on the beach and advanced up it. The Germans now came under heavy fire from the machine guns brought from the Surprise. Many of the new German recruits fled. At three o'clock in the afternoon, the French launched a major assault on the German positions. The resistance of German forces deteriorated and they eventually retreated. During the battle, the Germans made attempts to attack the French gunboat, Surprise which was situated in Corisco Bay. The steamer Itolo and armed launch Khios were both sunk in attacks against the French ship.Reynolds, Churchill, Miller 1916.  Aftermath  Memorial in Cocobeach commemorating the battle Following the battle, the column under the command of Miquelard would push eastward along the southern border of Spanish Guinea. The German force that had once occupied Ukoko retreated to Mbini in the neutral Spanish colony of R√≠o Muni to the north. This practice would be followed throughout the rest of the campaign where German units would escape to the Spanish colony and surrender there. The action at Ukoko, along with the landings that took place at Duala secured the coast of Kamerun for the Allies and greatly restricted the movements of German forces.

Chime Rinpoche was born in 1941 in Kham, Tibet. In 1959, due to the occupation of Tibet, he was forced to flee to India via Bhutan into exile. Gaining British citizenship in 1965. He taught extensively throughout Europe and established Marpa House, the first Tibetan Buddhist Centre in England. His students include American author and Buddhist nun Pema Ch√∂dr√∂n and musicians Mary Hopkin, David Bowie and Tony Visconti. Early life in Tibet Chime Rinpoche was born in Jyekundo, Kham, East Tibet, Tibet, into a family that were direct descendants of the chieftain Rardha Pontsong, who was inspired to give his land to the 4th Sangye Nyenpa so that Benchen Monastery could be built (in the 14th Century). He was not the only Tulku in his family, as both Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche and the 9th Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche were his maternal uncles. He was educated at Benchen Monastery, where he gained the Khenpo (Master of Studies) degree, Kyorpon (Shrine Ritual Master) degree and Dorje Lobpon (Vajra Master) degree. Chime Rinpoche studied and combined the practices of Mahamudra and Dzogchen (Atiyoga) through receiving instructions in Mahamudra from Kabje Sangye Nyenpa and Dzogchen from Dilgo Khentse Rinpoche. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Chime Rinpoche's uncle Escape from Tibet Due to the invasion of Tibet and subsequent occupation by the Chinese army, the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa indicated that Chime Rinpoche should flee Tibet. In 1959, Chime Rinpoche reached India via Bhutan alongside his Root Gurus and maternal uncles, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche and 9th Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche. Life in Britain In 1965, Lama Chime was invited to live in the UK. He shared a small apartment with Ch√∂gyam Trungpa Rinpoche and Akong Rinpoche in Oxford. He later gained British citizenship and has lived in Britain ever since. As Akong Rinpoche was the first one to find paid employment, becoming a hospital orderly, Akong supported both Chime Rinpoche and Trungpa Rinpoche. Marpa House In 1973, Chime Rinpoche founded Kham House in Ashdon, Essex, UK the first Tibetan Buddhist Centre in England. The building was purchased with the help of sponsors. Previously an orphanage for homeless children called All Saints' Home, it was built by the rector of Ashdon Henry Barclay Swete. In 1975, just two years after Kham House was established, the 16th Karmapa visited this centre after visiting the Kagyu Samy√© Ling Monastery and Tibetan Centre earlier in the year. Kham House was later renamed Marpa House and is run by the charity The Dharma Trust. Although presently in poor health, Chime Rinpoche still teaches at Marpa House on occasion. Status as a Tulku During his 1975 visit, the 16th Karmapa identified Chime Rinpoche as Radha Tulku, the incarnation of Radha Phuntsok, one of the four Tulkus (incarnate Lamas) of Benchen Monastery. The Four Benchen Tulkus are: *Chime Tulku (born 1991, not to be confused with the subject of this article) *Radha Tulku (Chime Rinpoche, the subject of this article) *Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche *Tenga Rinpoche In 2011, Chime Rinpoche travelled from London for a surprise reunion with two of the other Benchen Tulkus, Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche and Tenga Rinpoche, to the 2011 Summer Camp at Benchen Phuntsok Ling, Benchen's European headquarters.http://www.freezepage.com/1349892006ARSCOWUNGP?url=http://www.benchen.org/en/benchen- phuntsok-ling.html Personal life In England, Chime Rinpoche chose to stop being a monk and married. He and his English wife had three daughters, all of whom are now adults. In Britain, Chime Rinpoche is the President of the Tibetan Terrier Association, a club that is dedicated to preserve and promote the Tibetan Terrier breed of dog. The club was established in 1967. Rinpoche still teaches occasionally at Marpa House when his health permits and annually leads a ten-day Summer School retreat in Baerenthal in northeastern France. In a video message to his students on the passing of Tenga Rinpoche, Chime Rinpoche stated that he is preparing for his own visit to the 'Pure Lands' by praying and meditating more but assures his students that it is 'a very nice place, very nice'. Work at the British Library Rinpoche was employed by the British Library as Curator for Ancient Tibetan Manuscripts for 16 years. Notable students Pema Ch√∂dr√∂n * Pema Ch√∂dr√∂n - Before becoming a novice nun, Pema Ch√∂dr√∂n studied Dharma in London with Chime Rinpoche for several years. After taking her novice vows in 1974, Chime Rinpoche advised Ch√∂dr√∂n to seek training with Ch√∂gyam Trungpa Rinpoche, who later became Ch√∂dr√∂n's root guru. David Bowie * David Bowie - Chime Rinpoche also tutored David Bowie for a number of months at Tibet House in London. During an interview in 2001, Bowie relates the time of his first meeting with Chime Rinpoche, > \\"One day, I walked into the office and it was empty,\\" Bowie said, calling > from his New York office. \\"I went down the stairs and saw a man in saffron > robes. He said, in very broken English, 'You are looking for me.' I realized > years later that it was a question, but as a 16-year-old, I took it as a > statement: 'You are looking for me.'\\" The man in the saffron robes, Chime > Yong Dong Rinpoche, became Jones' guru for several months. \\"After a few > months of study, he told me, 'You don't want to be Buddhist [...] You should > follow music.\\" :Later, on his first album David Bowie, Bowie wrote and recorded the song \\"Silly Boy Blue\\" about a young Tibetan Monk who broke the rules as a tribute to his teacher. * Tony Visconti - Bowie later recorded the track live at the BBC with Tony Visconti, another student of Chime Rinpoche. Later, whilst recording Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps), Visconti invited Chime Rinpoche to speak with Bowie about his idea to stage a rock concert at the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet; however, nothing materialised.Strange Fascination: David Bowie: The Definitive Story, 2005, p.47 (Virgin) * Mary Hopkin - In 2010, the singer Mary Hopkin, with her son Morgan Visconti, dedicated the song \\"Chime\\" on their 2010 album, You Look Familiar, to Chime Rinpoche.

Glucarpidase is an enzyme that inactivates methotrexate rapidly after injection. Because this agent reduces systemic levels of methotrexate and could therefore interfere with efficacy, it is not recommended for use in patients with normal or only slightly impaired kidney function or in whom serum levels are normal. The main antidote for methotrexate overdoses prior to the approval of this drug were high doses of folinic acid. However, this agent was not always sufficient at preventing kidney failure due to methotrexate. Glucarpidase also degrades folinic acid so the two should not be used together (within two hours of one another). Glucarpidase, a recombinant form of the bacterial enzyme carboxypeptidase G2 converts methotrexate into glutamate and 2,4-diamino-N(10)-methylpteroic acid. These are generally much less toxic and are excreted largely by the liver. One case series in children has found that high-dose methotrexate therapy can be resumed after an instance of methotrexate-induced acute kidney injury successfully treated with glucarpidase.

He primarily creates abstract stone and metal sculptures. His work has been exhibited in museums and galleries throughout the US, as well as Europe and Asia. Personal life and education John Van Alstine was born in 1952 in Gloversville, New York and raised in the Adirondack region of the state. He attended St. Lawrence University in 1970‚Äì1971. In 1973, he received a scholarship to attend the Blossom Festival School in Cleveland/Kent, Ohio, where he studied sculpture with Richard Stankiewicz and Richard Hunt. In 1974, he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Kent State University. In 1976, he earned a Master of Fine Arts from Cornell University.  Professional background   Academia  In 1976, Van Alstine was hired as an assistant professor at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, where he taught drawing and sculpture through 1980. He moved to Washington, D.C. and joined the faculty of the University of Maryland in College Park in 1980, where he taught in the art department through 1986. In 1986 he left teaching and moved to the New York City area to pursue studio work full-time. The following year he purchased a 19th-century industrial complex on the banks of the Sacandaga River and in 1991 returned to the Adirondacks, where he works in the restored historic structure. He continues to give lectures on his work at colleges and universities, throughout the US and abroad. , Van Alstine lives in Wells, New York, alongside the Sacandaga River.  Awards  Van Alstine has been awarded fellowships, grants and citations from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation, Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation, National Endowment for the Arts, the Yaddo Fellowship, The Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation, New Jersey Council of the Arts, and the Merit Award in Beijing for his construction of a large-scale public sculpture in the Olympic Park Garden. Sisyphean Circle III, 2005  Artistic works  ;Sculpture Van Alstine works primarily with granite and steel mediums in a large scale format. He is known for stone and metal abstract sculptures exhibiting exceptional balance and poise. The works are often multilevel with references to the figure, classical, nautical, celestial and western mythological themes. Stone is used in an assemblage method, the way a welder uses steel, rather than in the traditional manner of subtraction. His work has touched on themes of Greek mythology, specifically the myth of Sisyphus. In 2008, Van Alstine was one of 50 artists to have his work chosen to be display at the 2008 Summer Olympics. The piece displayed, Rings of Unity ‚Äì Circles of Inclusion, was based on the Sisyphus myth, consisting of a large piece of stone suspended in the middle of a 16-foot ring made of bronze. The piece took two weeks to create in a foundry. As of 2008, Van Alstine was represented by David Floria Gallery in Aspen, Colorado. Prominent solo gallery exhibitions have included Gerald Peters in Santa Fe, New Mexico; Nohra Haime in New York City; and C. Grimaldis Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland. ;Public Works Towards the Heavens ‚Äì Large Scale and Broad Reaching Solstice Calendar, 1986 Beginning in 1986 while continuing to work on human scale work in his studio, Van Alstine embarked on the first in a series of \\"Celestial\\" works where he combined the character of large-scale contemporary sculpture with the tradition and function of humankind's oldest scientific instrument ‚Äì the calendar. Inspired by his travels to England, Mexico and the American west, he created works that together with their impressive scale, placement and design, simultaneously combine aspects of astronomy, physical science and contemporary art. \\"In our contemporary society we often lose sight of the natural occurrences that once impacted our ancestors and played an important role in shaping our collective conscious. The cyclical nature of the days, and seasons with their patterns light/darkness, plant/harvest, birth/ death have historically given meaning, structure and richness to our lives. This project offers the viewer an opportunity to regain awareness of these fundamental rhythms that continue to subconsciously shape our lives,\\" Van Alstine wrote in 1986.Van Alstine, John, \\"Austin College Campus Sculpture Proposal,\\" 1986 Responding to a specific site in Texas, Van Alstine created his first \\"celestial\\" sculpture using the calendar to connect art and science on the Austin College campus near Dallas. Using primitive stone forms suggesting ritual and observance, \\"Solstice Calendar\\" (1986) produces shadows of varying lengths based on the time of year marking the rhythms of season through solstice, equinox, solstice. Similar large scale works were created for SCR Super Computer Research Center in Washington in 1991, \\"Artery Sunwork\\" (1993) in Washington, DC and \\"Via Solaris\\" (2005‚Äì06) in Terre Haute, Indiana at Indiana State University. Van Alstine's most recent public projects include \\"Passage\\" 2011 commissioned by Tsinghua University in Beijing, China and installed on campus as part of the University's Centennial Sculpture Exhibition. On September 11, 2012 \\"Tempered by Memory\\" a 35-foot memorial sculpture fabricated with steel beams from the fallen New York World Trade Center was dedicated in High Rock Park, Saratoga Springs, NY. It was a collaborative effort with sculptor Noah Savett. In 2010 \\"Funambulist\\" a 30-foot high painted steel sculpture was permanently installed on the Michigan State University campus in Lansing, Michigan. Van Alstine received a merit award in 2008 for his commissioned work \\"Rings of Unity-Circles of Inclusion\\" created in conjunction with the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and installed permanently in the Olympic Garden. \\"Cardinalis\\" a 40-foot high piece made partially from a titanium wing of F-14 fighter was commissioned and installed at the Indianapolis International Airport, Indianapolis, Indiana. Sphere with Spikes, 1990 ;Drawings Van Alstine's drawings have been an informal, spontaneous form of expression. In contrast to the typically long and drawn out creation of one sculpture, he is attracted to drawing precisely because it is immediate and tactile and allows an important opportunity to experiment with color. He equates drawing with the process of clay modeling ‚Äì adding material by building up layers of pastel or charcoal, removing or excavating through the layers by vigorous erasures. Like a clay sculpture, his drawings are \\"shaped\\" rather than \\"drawn\\" in the traditional sense. John Dorsey, staff art critic for the Baltimore Sun wrote, \\"Van Alstine's jaunty drawings recall his sculptures; they also exhibit a line reminiscent of Claes Oldenburg's, combined with sensitive use of color.\\" Van Alstine's early drawings were tight and functional, often used as \\"blueprints\\" for his system-based, arrested energy sculpture of the late 70s and early 80s. Like the sculpture that followed, the drawings soon became more loose and lyrical. By 1983, black and white charcoal drawings like Totem with Spike (1982) and Arch with Spikes (1983) were in keeping with the aggressively expressive three-dimensional works of that time; 4th Beast of Daniel (1983), and the unpainted version of Drastic Measures (1984). The drawings have continued to evolve, sometime foreshadowing changes in his sculpture such as in drawings like Sphere with Spikes (1990). At other times, the drawings parallel and act as two- dimensional interpretations of the 3D work, as in Implement XIII (1993). In his collaborative 2011 Tempered by Memory 35-foot high memorial sculpture built for the City of Saratoga Springs, New York Citying salvaged steel from the fallen World Trade Center in New York City, Van Alstine executed a number of drawings based on the 3D models he built for the project. ;Photography Amish Easel Landscape 1979 Van Alstine's photographs ask knowing questions about sentiment, perception, and the history of art. Created in the late 1970s early 1980s when Van Alstine was in the western U.S., the Easel Landscape Series was a site-specific installation project designed to question and examine the accepted convention of frame as \\"signal\\" or \\"sanctioning\\" device for art. The series takes clues from many sources, including the \\"on site\\" plein air paintings of Claude Monet, such as the Haystack or Cathedral series, and surrealist Ren√© Magritte in paintings like The Promenades of Euclid, where Magritte presents the viewer with the image of a painted canvas on an easel simultaneously in front of a window while acting as a window. The photographs, shot in the field with a medium format film camera, were created before the days of Photoshop and easy digital photo manipulation. The series was exhibited in 1981 at New York's Marlborough Gallery exhibition Color Photography: Five New Views. Artforum Magazine wrote, \\"Color photography's relationship to the other arts is investigated in John Van Alstine's landscapes. His scenes of majestic mountains and rolling plains are of the sort made famous not only by the 'nature is beautiful' school of black and white photography but also by the plein air school of landscape painting. In Amish Easel Landscape, (1979) and Easel Landscape after Monet, (1980), the landscape contains a steel easel which frames a detail from the same scene. The juxtaposition of 'the photograph within the photograph' and 'the photograph' gives the image a biting conceptual edge that draws attention to the distinctive ways of seeing that photography and painting each offer'.\\"  Gallery  File:\\"Splay\\" 2012.jpgSplay 2012, granite and pigmented steel File:Kettering Arch I, 2002.jpgKettering Arch I, 2002, limestone and steel, 19\\"h x33'w x8\\"d File:Sisyphean Holiday (Portals-Passages) 2009, John Van Alstine-sculptor.jpgSisyphean Holiday (Portals-Passages) 2009 File:Funambulist, 2010, steel, 30'h x40'w x15'd, Michigan State University, Lansing, MI.jpgFunambulist 2010, steel, 30'h x40'w x15'd, Michigan State University, Lansing, MI File:Doryphorus.jpgDoryphorus, 2000, granite and bronze, 112\\"h x40\\"w x28\\"d File:Pique a Terre VI.jpgJohn Van Alstine sculptor, Pique a Terre VI, 1997, gray granite and steel, 50\\"h x108\\"l x50\\"d File:John Van Alstine solo exhibit Diane Brown Gallery 1984.jpgJohn Van Alstine solo exhibit Diane Brown Gallery, NYC 1984 File:John Van Alstine - during fabrication of Fleche III in 2008.jpgphoto - John Van Alstine studio, Wells, New York 2008, slate/pigmented steel, 66\\"h x62\\"w x22\\"d (w/o pedestal) Selected Large Scale Public Works Trough 1982, Billings,MT * 1982: Trough, Billings, Montana * 1986: Solitace Calendar, Austin College, Sherman, Texas * 1993: Artery Sunwork, Bethesda, Maryland * 2004: 2nd Street Sunwork, Hoboken, New Jersey * 2006: Via Solaris, Indiana State University Terre Haute, Indiana * 2006‚Äì8: Cardinalis, Indianapolis International Airport, Indianapolis, Indiana * 2008: Sacandaga Totem, Alexandria, Virginia * 2008: Rings of Unity ‚Äì Circles of Inclusion, 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing, China * 2008‚Äì10: Funambulist, Michigan State University, Lansing, Michigan * 2010‚Äì11: Tempered by Memory, Saratoga Springs, New York * 2011: Passage, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China  Public collections  * Albany Institute of History and Art, Albany, New York * Baltimore Museum of Art, Baltimore, Maryland * Bioethics Institute, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland * Blanton Museum of Art, University of Texas at Austin * City of Beijing, China, 2008 Olympic Park Exhibition Collection * Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania * Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. * Dayton Art Institute, Dayton, Ohio * Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas, Texas * Delaware Art Museum, Wilmington, Delaware * Denver Art Museum, Gift of List Foundation, New York City * Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. * Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas * Herbert F.

It offers training programs, workshops, and activities in a number of scientific fields. Mission The organization's mission is to create a suitable atmosphere for the practices of scientific hobbies; encourage scientific activities among the younger population, and increase their interest in the sciences. Background The club was established in 1987 under a decree which was issued by the vice chairman of Qatar Youth Welfare higher council as a response to a request which was submitted by twenty-five members. Initially, the club only had two sections which were Electronics and Electricity, however, the number of sections increased as the club members number was growing. Departments and sections The club consists of a number of departments including astronomy, aviation, engineering and others. There is a dedicated Young Scientists department where children can join and participate in different scientific experiments and activities. Due to cultural reasons, female members have a separate department which is called \\"Scientific Girl Club\\" and it runs its activities separately from the other main departments; however there is collaboration between these departments. Community initiatives In 2008, the club launched the \\"Green Computer\\" project in association with Microsoft. The project sought to recycle outdated and discarded computers from companies and homes so that they can be re-used by peoples of lower income. In 2012, the project received funding by the Commercial Bank of Qatar in the form of a QR200,000 grant, in addition to receiving funding from Microsoft. The project also began extending its operations to other countries the same year. The QSC conducted a joint-venture with Qatar Science & Technology Park when it co-hosted the \\"Future Scientist Summer Camp 2010\\". The main aim of the camp was to explain scientific and technological themes to a predicted 1,000 children between the ages of 6 to 16. It featured interactive exhibits and workshops.

It represented labourers and semi-skilled workers employed in the steel industry and ironworking, and later also the chemical industry.  History  Formation The Federated Ironworkers' Assistants' Association of Australia was formed on 25 September 1908 at a meeting held at the Sydney Trades Hall, attended by delegates from several small state-based unions from New South Wales and Victoria, including the Amalgamated Ironworkers' Assistants' Union and the Amalgamated Society of Ironworkers' Assistants of Victoria. The newly formed FIA expanded its representation to Queensland and South Australia in the following year at its first full conference held in Melbourne in April 1909. The union received federal registration in 1911, despite objections raised by several tradesmen's craft unions, including the Federated Society of Boilermakers and the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. These unions were concerned with preserving the distinction between their skilled members and the unskilled assistant ironworkers. The FIA resisted limiting their membership to assistant ironworkers following its recent amalgamation in January 1911 with the Eskbank Ironworkers' Association of Mill and Forge Workers, which represented workers at the G. & C. Hoskins steel mill at Lithgow. Growth Starting from a membership of approximately 5000 the union grew rapidly during World War I and also amalgamated with several smaller unions to reach a membership of close to 10,000 by the early 1920s, approximately 10 percent of total union membership in the Australian metal industry. Half the union's membership was from New South Wales, which was divided up into several branches, including Sydney, Lithgow, Newcastle and Granville. A new branch was formed in 1917 to represent ironworkers in the shipbuilding industry in Balmain. The FIA became increasingly militant during the first two decades of its existence, influenced by the debate over conscription in World War I, to which it was opposed, and the Australian General Strike of 1917, which involved 3000 New South Wales ironworkers. During this period the FIA became influenced by the radical left-wing political ideas of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), and in 1919 held a referendum over whether to affiliate to the proposed general union, the One Big Union (OBU). The proposal received 60 percent support from the membership, particularly in Sydney, but was not adopted by the 1920 Federal Council of the union. During the 1930s the Communist Party of Australia (CPA) became heavily influential within the union. In 1936 Ernie Thornton, a member of the CPA's central committee, was elected part-time general secretary. Following the recovery of the economy in the late 1930s the position was made full-time and Thornton moved to Sydney, where he strengthened communist influence within the FIA. Thornton's leadership of the FIA was threatened in the 1949 union elections when the Balmain branch, backed by the Labor Industrial Groups, ran a rival ticket headed by Laurie Short. Thornton won but Short took the case to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, which found that \\"persons unknown\\" had rigged the ballot, leaving Short as National Secretary. Thornton resigned in 1950 to become Australasia's representative at the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) liaison bureau in Peking, but he was left without a job when the Australian Council of Trade Unions withdrew recognition of the WFTU. The FIA refused to accept him back and Thornton was employed full-time by the Communist Party. Laurie Short, a staunch anti-communist, was national secretary of the union from 1951 to 1982. In 1983, FIA unsuccessfully sought re-affiliation with the Labor Party, which it had severed during the Australian Labor Party split of 1955. The union ultimately rejoined the Labor Party through its merger with the ALP-affiliated Australian Workers Union (AWU) in 1993. Amalgamation The union underwent several amalgamations, absorbing the Arms, Explosives and Munitions Workers' Federation in 1943, and later the Federated Artificial Fertiliser and Chemical Workers' Union of Australia in 1975, extending the union's coverage to the chemical industry. The FIA merged with the Australasian Society of Engineers in 1991 to form the Federation of Industrial Manufacturing and Engineering Employees. This new union absorbed several small manufacturing unions before itself merging into the Australian Workers Union in 1993. The AWU continues to represent workers covered by the FIA.

She is a University Distinguished Professor at Colorado State University in Fort Collins and works with the University of Colorado School of Medicine's Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics. 3D nucleosome structure, histone proteins in center, DNA around outside  Life  Luger was born the youngest child after several brothers. Though not interested in mathematics, electronics, or physics, as her brothers were, she became fascinated with biology. She has stated that she chose a career in science during middle school, when she realized that \\"not everything was 'known' yet\\". As a young woman in Austria, Luger attended a gymnasium where she specialized in foreign languages. Luger is married and has one daughter.  Education  Luger earned a Bachelor of Science in microbiology and a Master of Science in biochemistry from the University of Innsbruck. She completed her Ph.D in biochemistry and biophysics at the University of Basel.  Career  In 1997, as a postdoc with Timothy Richmond, Luger was first author on the paper that described the first structure determined for the nucleosome. The structure was discovered by X-ray crystallography. She also proposed that histone-DNA bonds are weaker at points where less of the histone contacts the DNA, which was confirmed by Michelle Wang in a 2009 paper. After several years at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Luger was hired by Colorado State University in 1999. Her work there includes extensive further research on the nucleosome's three-dimensional structure. The nucleosome, a building block of the chromatin genetic material that makes up chromosomes, consists of DNA wrapped around a disk of proteins. In 2005, Luger and Kenneth Kaye used X-ray crystallography to determine the mechanism that the virus causing Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer that affects subdermal connective tissue, uses to spread. The virus attaches to chromatin and inserts its genetic material, which is then copied along with the cell's DNA. Luger and Kaye thus showed that a virus can attach to chromatin as a \\"docking platform\\". Since 2010, Luger has done significant studies of histones, researching the connection between their chaperone proteins and acetylation, as well as variant structures. Histones are important in the process of gene expression, and their positioning as determined by chaperone proteins is essential to that role. The chaperones also can change the conformation of the nucleosome as a whole. Modifications to histones, including acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation, are important because of their role in activating and deactivating genes. In 2008, Luger published a study that showed that physical changes to the nucleosome do not occur when DNA is methylated. Luger's research as of 2012 also comprises several other areas of study with chromatin, including the processes of DNA replication, transcription, recombination, and repair in chromatin. She and her research group have also developed various assays for examining chromatin structure, to augment traditional X-ray crystallography. Another related research interest for Luger's research group is the genetic cause of Rett syndrome, the gene MECP2. The gene codes for a protein that binds to methyl groups on chromatin, altering its conformation.  Honors  Luger has received many honors throughout her career. While in Austria, she received the State of Vorarlberg's State Science Prize. She was the recipient of the Searle Scholar Award in 1999, her first year as a professor at Colorado State University. In 2003, she was named a Monfort Professor and awarded $75,000 a year for two years in research funds by the university. Two years later, Luger was appointed as an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. From 2008 to 2012, Luger sat on the National Institute of General Medical Sciences' advisory board. She has also received several prestigious grants throughout her career, including a 5-year award from the National Institute of Health and a $1.2 million grant from the W. M. Keck Foundation. In 2012, Luger was chosen to be the National Lecturer for the Biophysical Society's 2013 meeting. In 2017, Luger has been selected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2018, Luger was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.

Regular season The 1946-47 season would be the last year that Doug Mills would be the head coach of the Fighting Illini, however; he would remain as the University of Illinois athletic director until 1966. During his tenure at the helm, Mills' coached 217 games over 11 seasons. Overall his teams won 151 games and lost only 66, the 151 wins remains 4th all-time in Illini history. During the Big Ten Conference season, Mills' teams won 88 games while losing only 47. Included in the 88 wins would be back-to- back conference titles in 1942 and 1943 where his teams would go 35-6 overall and 25-2 in the conference. Amazingly, Mills' three championships ('37, '42, '43) in just 11 years, place him just one behind Harry Combes, his replacement as head coach, for the most conference championships. An attempt to regroup 'The Whiz Kids' occurred during the 1946-47 season when Ken Menke, Gene Vance, and Andy Phillip returned from their service in World War II. January also saw the return of All-American guard Walt Kirk from his time in military service. Additionally, Dike Eddleman was not available to play until January based on the football team playing in the Rose Bowl. Unfortunately, the chemistry was not the same and the team finished in a tie for second in the conference with a record of 8 wins, 4 losses. Overall, the team finished with a 14-6 record. The starting lineup at the beginning of the season included 4 of the 5 Whiz Kids, guards Smiley and Vance, forwards Phillip and Ken Menke and Fred Green at center. However, as January unfolded, Mills would insert Kirk and freshman Bill Erickson into the starting lineup as well.A Century of Orange and Blue: Celebrating 100 Years of Fighting Illini Basketball By Loren Tate, Jared Gelfond pgs.36-38 Roster SourceMen's Basketball Roster Schedule - !colspan=12 style=\\"background:#DF4E38; color:white;\\" Non-Conference regular season - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" - !colspan=9 style=\\"background:#DF4E38; color:#FFFFFF;\\"Big Ten regular season Bold Italic connotes conference game SourceUniversity of Illinois Fighting Illini Statistics Summary for 1943‚Äì44 pg.81, FightingIllini.com Player stats { \\"wikitable sortable\\" - !style=\\"\\" Player !style=\\"\\" Games Played !style=\\"\\" Field Goals !style=\\"\\" Free Throws !style=\\"\\" Points - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Andy Phillip 208130192 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Ken Menke207236180 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Fred Green207225169 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Jack Smiley205638150 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Gene Vance204937135 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Walt Kirk19312284 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Bill Erickson 2027761 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Jack Burmaster 1515434 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Bob Doster 1212731 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Dick Foley 1611426 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Bob Lavoy1171125 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Dwight Eddleman 105212 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Benton Odum 24311 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Dwight Humphrey11408 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Wally Osterkorn 8146 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Ron Bontemps 4022 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Burdette Thurlby 4011 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Robert Rowe 5000 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Roy Gatewood2000 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" } Awards and honors * Dwight Eddleman **Fighting Illini All-Century team (2005) *Andy Phillip **True Magazine 1st team All-American (1947) **National Association of Basketball Coaches 1st team All-American (1947) **Consensus 2nd team All-American (1947) **Converse Honorable Mention All-American (1947) **Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame (1961) *Jack Smiley **Helms 3rd Team All-American (1947) **Converse Honorable Mention All-American (1947) **Team Most Valuable Player List of MVPs *Gene Vance **Converse Honorable Mention All-American (1947) References Illinois Fighting Illini Category:Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball seasons Category:1946 in sports in Illinois Category:1947 in sports in Illinois ","title":"1946‚Äì47 Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team"},{"id":"38021348","title":"R.

Since 2001, Indergaard holds a dual citizenship with South Africa and Great Britain in order to compete internationally for diving. She is a three-time British diving champion and a bronze medalist for the synchronised springboard at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia. Diving career Indergaard, a native of Johannesburg, South Africa, started her sporting career as a gymnast at the very young age until she took up diving in 1992. She achieved her early success by winning the gold medal for diving as a demonstration sport at the 1995 All-Africa Games in Harare, Zimbabwe, and represented South Africa at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where she met British-born Adrian Hinchliffe, who later served as her personal coach. In 2000, Indergaard graduated from the University of the Witwatersrand, with a degree in physical education. She was also selected for South Africa to compete at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, but the South African Olympic Committee had decided not to send her. In April 2001, Indergaard moved from her native South Africa to England in order to pursue her further career in diving. She later became a member of the British national diving team (Team GB), and joined the City of Leeds Diving Club, under her personal and head coach Hinchliffe. Indergaard represented her current nation Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, where she and partner Jane Smith finished outside the medals in fourth place for the synchronised springboard, with a score of 302.25. After Smith's retirement in 2005, she teamed up with partner Hayley Sage, and together captured the bronze medal at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia. In the same year, she eventually married her close friend and Norwegian-born physiotherapist Ove Indergaard in Leeds. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Indergaard and her partner Sage, however, displayed a disastrous performance in the women's 3 m synchronised springboard event, finishing only in eighth place, with a final score of 278.25. Shortly after the Olympics, Indergaard immediately retired from her sporting career, and currently works as a physical education teacher for teenagers at the John Charles Centre for Sport in Leeds.

It belongs to the Vicariate of Sts. Peter and Paul under the Ecclesiastical Province of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lingayen-Dagupan. The 57, 840 Catholics is under the pastoral care of Rev. Fidelis B. Layog, assisted by Rev. Isidro Palinar, Jr. and andRev. Raymund Manaois. The Spanish-colonial-era Church was declared a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines and the National Commission for Culture and the Arts. Church history Built in several stages from the 17th to 19th centuries by the Dominicans, the best- preserved Pangasinan church bell tower and some parts have been reconstructed because of earthquakes. The 17th Century Calasiao Dominican Provincial chapter church under St. Paul's patronage became Sts. Peter and Paul Parish under Fr. Juan Maldonado de San Pedro Martin as parish priest after 1621. In 1763, Filipino rebel Palaris (Binalatongan or San Carlos) burned the church. In 1804. Bishop Miguel Garcia de Nueva Segovia presided over the 1773 Synod of Calasiao at the sprawling Convento (per Manila Provincial Council Acts of 1771 to implement Decrees). Archbishop Basilio Sancho de Santa Justa y Rufina convened the Council from May to November, 1771. Calasiao had a new church of 3 naves (89 varas or yards long, 22 wide and 18 high with 2 rows of windows) with a bell tower. But in 1841 to 1842, this church was destroyed and rebuilt by Father Dalman in 1852 and then burned and restored from 1853 to 1858 by Father Ramos Suarez. The March 16, 1892 earthquake damaged the church. Dominican Vicar Fr. Bonifacio Probanza left Calasiao in 1898. The 1936 Christ the King saw a new church. In 1945, the Lingayen cathedral and the archbishop's palace was temporarily transferred to Calasiao amid the miraculous 3 Liberation bombs thrown into the church and convent but failed to explode, The earthquake July 16, 1990 destroyed its belfry. Msgr. Luis B. Ungson reconstructed the church's and restored the bricked front wall, antique statues and the ceiling's original floral motif. Parish priests included, Fr. Juan Bello, Fathers Benigno Serafica, Jos√© Ferrer and Msgr. Oscar Aquino under Bishop Jesus Cabrera. The present Parish Priest is Fidelis B. Layog. Msgr. Luis Ungson is assisted by Fr. Ronwell Fabregas and by Fr. Jose R. Carino and Allen O. Romero. At present, the church owns fully automatic bells or chimes which could be heard within 7- or 8-kilometer radius. Description Calasiao's prioririty status is due to its geographic representation of various regions across the nation, being one of the largest churches in Pangasinan. The imposing Latin American-style facade of bricks and cement of Calasiao Church, today, is 88.3 meter long, 25 meters wide and 27.3 meters high. The sprawling convent is 75 meters long, 25 meters wide and has 2 yards. Its 5-storey octagonal brick bell tower (replica of the earthquake destroyed original on July 16, 1990) with architectural designs that slightly resemble those of the Southeast Asian Hindu-Buddhist Pagodas is 30 meters high. The prized original retablos (and a classic altar) is ornately decorated with statues of saints. The Baroque-style carved, the painted ceilings and the magnificent overall exterior are preserved for centuries. The intricate sculpture has tone of the Renaissance age's undying European Art as demonstrated by the majesty of its ceiling or dome, walls and the altar from the aisle near the main door. The magnificent structure's main door, the entrance to the church features some heavy details: \\"Iglesia Parroquial San Pedro Y San Pablo Calasiao, Pangasinan\\". The church's large wooden floors on the second floor was setting of Mga Kuwento ni Lola Basyang and the Sleeping beauty Episode. Outside, sculptures, could be found including the cave of the Nativity and the Sunico heritage bell on display and the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Museo Calasiao, a mini museum stands on the right side of the church inside the sprawling convent which shows some vintage photos and history of the church. Its dome-kitchen structure separately engineered from the church and the convent is one of its odd and distinct features. Some parts of the church are currently being renovated as there are plans to promote it as a tourist attraction. Father Layog adds there are plans to put up a gallery so that visitors can appreciate the church‚Äôs historical value. In front of the church and Convento are spacious parking areas for vehicles tightly guarded by a solid iron entrance gate. Some meters therefrom is the famous \\"Senor Divino Tesoro Shrine\\" with the miraculous statue of a crucified Jesus Christ (believed to grow in size). 1588 Parish Church of Saints Peter and Paul (prized original retablos and classic altar ornately decorated with statues of saints). Baroque church As one of the Baroque Churches of the Philippines, the Parish Church of Saints Peter and Paul has been at the forefront of Philippine history-Spanish colonial rule. Its unique architectural design reflects the Spanish and Latin American architecture integration of indigenous Philippines works of art with Chinese style fusion. Its massive bricks or ladrillo had been designed to withstand revolts and rebellions, due to its fortresses facade. Its massive retablo mayor is massive and complex woodwork is seen at the back. Within the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippine Church of Calasiao, known as Earthquake Baroque, has powerful and most imposing buttresses and foundations but failed upon earthquakes' annihilations.

Retrieved 2017-05-06 History It was originally the Samaritan Hospital which was founded by Russell Conwell on January 18, 1892 through the purchase of a three-story house at the intersection of Broad and Ontario St. The original hospital had twenty beds and only two full-time staff members. The hospital expanded with the addition of the Greathart Hospital as a maternity hospital and further facilities in the next decade after its founding. Samaritan Hospital was renamed to Temple University Hospital in 1929. William Parkinson, who was appointed as the director of the hospital and Dean of School of Medicine in February 1929, oversaw its renovation and expansion to a 500-bed capacity by 1940. Development progressed in 1950s with the leadership of William Parkinson as three new buildings were added to accommodate the increasing number of individuals served by the hospital. A new ancillary and outpatient building were added along with Parkinson Pavilion, which added 600 inpatient beds. Further development came in December 1982 when a replacement hospital was approved on Broad and Ontario to replace the main hospital building with a 504-bed facility. The new nine- story hospital opened in 1986 with an expanded emergency department, while the Parkinson Pavilion was renovated to an outpatient facility. Temple University Health System Until 1994, Temple University and Temple University Hospital were one entity. Peter J.

In 2007 he co-founded Wonga, an internet payday loan company that gained notoriety for charging extremely high interest on short-term loans. After Damelin stepped down as CEO of the company in 2013, the company went into administration on 30 August 2018.  Biography  Errol Damelin was born in South Africa on 23 August 1969. Damelin grew up in a Jewish family in Klerksdorp, South Africa, with his father being an anaesthesiologist. Upon graduating from high school Damelin attended the University of Cape Town, where he studied Business Science and Law. He was politically active at the university, winning an election to the UCT Students Representative Council and participating in anti-aparteid rallies. During this time he was detained for protesting against the apartheid government policy of detention without trial. He graduated from the University of Cape Town in 1992, finishing his studies at Boston University in Boston, United States with a Masters of Science in Management. Damelin subsequently emigrated to Israel, where he began working as a corporate finance banker at an Israeli investment bank.Wonga chief speaks to the JC In 1997 he left his job to help found Barzelan, a producer of speciality steel wire based in Beit Shemesh, Israel. In 2000 Damelin founded Supply Chain Connect, a cloud based supply chain software company. Based in London, United Kingdom, the company developed software for the supply chains of companies, including Dow Chemicals, DuPont, Phelps Dodge, General Cable, Mondi Packaging, and Corning. In 2005 Damelin sold the business to ChemConnect for an undisclosed amount. In 2007 Damelin and Jonty Hurwitz launched Wonga.com, a payday loan website that provided short term loans to borrowers in the United Kingdom and abroad. Despite initial skepticism from banks, Wonga processed one hundred thousand loans within two years and lowered its initial 50% default rate significantly. By 2013 the company had grown to over five hundred employees, with revenues of ¬£300 million. That year it also acquired the Germany-based BillPay and launched Everline, a provider of loans for small and medium-sized businesses. In November 2013 Damelin stepped down as CEO of the company due to its declining profits and allegations that it was exploiting the most vulnerable in society. Several weeks later, Wonga was required by the Financial Conduct Authority to offer about ¬£2.6 million in compensation to customers for poor historic debt collection practices, which had included the sending of fake solicitor letters to its customers. Several months prior, Damelin had called for better regulation of the consumer lending sector and more transparency in the wider financial services industry of the United Kingdom. When asked about Wonga's controversial lending practices after his resignation, Damelin said that he had no moral issues with them, claiming that that credit could be an important force for good when given transparently and fairly and that Wonga's customers were overwhelmingly happy with and supportive of the company. After an increase in customer compensation claims, Wonga went into administration on 30 August 2018.  Personal life  Damelin lives in London and has three children.  Awards  Damelin has received several entrepreneurial awards: * 2008 ‚Äì Credit Suisse Entrepreneur of the year at the National Business Awards, South East * 2009 ‚Äì Ruban d‚ÄôHonneur in the RSM International Entrepreneur of the Year category of the European Business Awards * 2010 ‚Äì Digital Entrepreneur of the Year (Digital Entrepreneur Awards) * 2010 ‚Äì Entrepreneur of the Year (Growing Business Awards) * 2010 ‚Äì Founder of the Year (Tech Crunch ‚Äì The Europa's) * 2011 ‚Äì Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year * 2011 ‚Äì The Guardian's Digital Entrepreneur of the Year * 2012 ‚Äì Founder of the Year (Founders Forum)  Philanthropy  Damelin has donated to Jewish charities and has appeared on panels and discussions for World Jewish Relief and Jewish Care. Damelin has also been an ambassador for Charity: Water and ran the Antarctic Ice marathon, where he raised substantial funds for the charity. In 2015 Damelin became a founding member of Founders Pledge, a group of technology entrepreneurs who pledged 2% of the equity in their companies to philanthropic causes.

He wrote his own text, beginning \\"Have you heard the sound of the angel voices\\", three stanzas with the refrain \\"Gloria in excelsis Deo\\". It has been part of recordings of collections of Christmas music, including one conducted by the composer.  History  Rutter first composed Angels‚Äô Carol in the 1980s to be performed by the winners of a competition choirboy and choirgirl in London, now defunct. He later arranged it for mixed-voice choir (SATB), with harp or piano or orchestra. The work was published by Oxford University Press.  Text and music  Rutter, who composed many works to celebrate Christmas, wrote his own text for Angels' Carol, beginning \\"Have you heard the sound of the angel voices\\". The text alludes to several aspects of the Christmas story, with the Latin refrain \\"Gloria in excelsis Deo\\" from the angels' song mentioned in the Gospel of Luke narration of the annunciation to the shepherds. The music is in F major, alla breve-time, and marked \\"Brightly\\". It begins with two measures of arpeggios by harp or piano, reminiscent of Bach's Prelude in C major from The Well-Tempered Clavier. The harp, the first instrument the composer had in mind, was also played by King David, and plays a major role in Britten's A Ceremony of Carols. The sopranos, optionally with the altos, sing the first phrase, marked \\"eagerly\\". Their motif, an upward triad of two identical quavers and two crotchets beginning after the beat and arriving at a long note. The rhythmic pattern is repeated in all voices throughout the verses. The reply in a different key is given by the tenors alone, then the first lenor is repeated by sopranos and tenors in unison, leading to the first refrain \\"Gloria\\", which is marked \\"joyfully\\". The quotation from the angels' song after annunciation to the shepherds according to the Gospel of Luke is sung by the choir, now in harmony with third parallels. In the refrain, two quavers begin on the beat. In the second verse, the tenors have the first line, \\"He is come in peace\\", with the upper voices humming. The third verse, \\"He will bring new light\\", is transposed by a shift in harmony, and is intensified by imitation, and by more entries with new thoughts about Earth and Heavens rejoicing. The final refrain also appears is in a denser texture with divided sopranos, before the piece ends softly, marked \\"Tranquil\\", with the high voices sing \\"Christ is born\\" over the humming men's voices. Recordings  Angels' Carol was recorded in 2001 as part of The John Rutter Christmas Album, sung by The Cambridge Singers with the City of London Sinfonia, conducted by the composer. Stephen Layton led a recording with his Polyphony chamber choir and the City of London Sinfonia, released in 2001. It was recorded as part of A Christmas Celebration in 2014 by the Hall√© Choir, youth choir, children‚Äôs choir and orchesta, conducted by Stephen Bell.

The group rapidly expanded in size and prominence in 2012, before suffering internal splits and battlefield reversals in 2013 that greatly reduced its influence. By 2014, the group was largely defunct, with member factions joining other rebel groups. The brigades were named Farouq after Omar bin al-Khattab, a Sahaba (companion) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the second Caliph.  History  The Farouq Brigades emerged from the central city of Homs just months into the Syrian Civil War. Its beginnings are as a subunit of the Khalid ibn al-Walid Brigade, a group of defectors from the Syrian Army that announced its formation in June 2011 and engaged in clashes with members of the Syrian security forces in Homs and Al- Rastan. The group started out with 3,000+ fighters. During the second half of 2011, Farouq was active in Homs, particularly the Baba Amr neighborhood. It was led by a defector, Lieutenant Abdul Razaq Tlass, who was a nephew of the former Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass. The apparent success of Farouq in holding territory in Baba Amr led to the Syrian government escalating their use of force in an offensive in early 2012, causing heavy casualties amongst the rebels and forcing their retreat into the Homs countryside and the towns of Al-Qusayr and Al-Rastan. In the following months, Farouq absorbed preexisting rebel units and formed new ones across Syria, from Daraa in the south near the Jordanian border to the Farouq al-Shemal (Northern Farouq) which controlled some of the border posts in the north with Turkey. In September 2012, a large number of Islamist rebel brigades, including the Farouq Brigades and the Suquor al-Sham formed the Syrian Islamic Liberation Front, under the leadership of Suquor al-Sham commander Ahmed Abu Issa. Abu Issa claimed the new Front had more than 40,000 fighters, and aimed to establish a state with an Islamic reference. In May 2013, the BBC gave estimate of 20,000 fighters. In November 2013, the SILF was superseded by a new rebel coalition called the Islamic Front; however, Farouq was not a member of this grouping.  Ideology and funding  Jeffrey White, a former U.S. defense intelligence officer with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and Joseph Holliday, a research analyst with the Institute for the Study of War consider the Farouq Brigade to be ‚Äúmoderately Islamist‚Äù ‚Äì that is, neither secular nor Salafis. While many of their fighters wear Jihadist- style black headbands and beards, it is unclear how much of this is genuine belief and how much is to secure additional funding from Islamist donors. Farouq has their own public relations wing which film their battlefield operations and upload them to YouTube and Facebook with their groups logo. These clips are used for fundraising from Syrians, donors in Gulf states, western sources and Islamist groups.  Controversies  In April 2012, the Farouq Brigades was accused of collecting jizyah, or taxes imposed on non- Muslims living under Muslim rule, in Christian areas of Homs province. However, the group denied this and the Institute for the Study of War said that \\"the accusation is likely from the Assad regime\\". There were also reports that the group had expelled 90% of the Christian population of Homs City. However, Jesuits in Homs disputed the cause of the exodus, and said that Christians were not targeted specifically, but fled the city on their own initiative because of the ongoing conflict. According to interviews made by McClatchy Newspapers of refugees in Lebanon, there was no targeting of Christians because of their religion. Rather, a number of government- affiliated Christians were seized by the Farouq Brigades, which led to some Christians fleeing the area. In August 2012, Lieutenant Abdul Razzaq Tlass, one of the Farouq Brigades top leaders, was implicated in a sex scandal when video was posted to YouTube appearing to show him having cybersex with a woman through Skype. Tlass and others claimed the video was a fabrication by the Syrian Government. Nevertheless, by October 2012, Tlass was replaced as commander by Abu Sayeh Juneidi. In September 2012, the northern branch of the Farouq Brigades was accused of kidnapping and killing Abu Mohamad al-Absi, a Syrian Jihadist who led a group of foreign fighters. The local Farouq Brigades leader said the foreign fighters had ignored their demands to leave the Bab al-Hawa border post. He said that al-Absi had \\"raised the al-Qaeda flag, and al-Qaeda is not welcomed by us\\". In May 2013, a video was posted on the internet showing rebel commander Abu Sakkar cutting organs from the dead body of a Syrian soldier and putting one of them in his mouth, \\"as if he is taking a bite out of it\\". He called rebels to follow his example and terrorize the Alawite sect, which mostly backs Assad. Human Rights Watch confirmed the authenticity of the footage, and stated that \\"The mutilation of the bodies of enemies is a war crime. But the even more serious issue is the very rapid descent into sectarian rhetoric and violence\\". It said that Abu Sakkar appears to be a commander of the \\"Independent Omar al-Farouq Brigade\\". The BBC called it an offshoot or sub-unit of the Farouq Brigades, saying that \\"the Farouq Brigade appears to be actually a complex of sub-units with a tangled pedigree\\". Human Rights Watch said \\"It is not known whether the Independent Omar al-Farouq Brigade operates within the command structure of the Free Syrian Army\\". The incident was condemned by the FSA's Chief of Staff and the Syrian National Coalition said that the commander would be put on trial. The rebel Supreme Military Council called for Abu Sakkar's arrest, saying it wants him \\"dead or alive\\". Abu Sakkar said that the mutilation was revenge. He claimed he found a video on the soldier's cellphone in which the soldier sexually abuses a woman and her two daughters, along with other videos showing Assad loyalists raping, torturing, dismembering and killing people, including children. He further stated that if the war was to continue, \\"all Syrian people\\" would be like him. He was killed in northwest Latakia province on 6 April 2016 by the Syrian Army, while being affiliated to the al-Qaeda linked Al-Nusra Front. In November 2016 in Tyrol, Austria, a former fighter of the Farouq Brigades was prosecuted for the summary execution of 20 wounded Syrian Army soldiers while in Homs between 2013 and 2014. In May 2017, he was found guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment in Austria.  Decline  By November 2013, the Farouq Brigades was reported as having suffered a serious decline in strength and area of influence, with it having splintered into numerous smaller factions, such as the Independent Omar al-Farouq Brigade and the Islamic al-Farouq Brigades. The group's presence outside Homs was said to have declined after losing feuds with more hardline Islamist rebel groups, like Ahrar ash-Sham and Jabhat al-Nusra, resulting in Farouq being expelled from the Raqqa Governorate and losing control of the strategic border crossing at Tal Abyad. By 2014, the rebel Hazzm Movement contained several groups that were formerly part of the Farouq Brigades. After 2015, the remnants of the Farouq Brigades only officially operated around the town of Binnish, in the Idlib District of the Idlib Governorate. On 1 February 2017, they joined Ahrar al-Sham. In northern Hama, other remnants under the banner of the Farouq Brigade joined Tahrir al-Sham on 20 March 2017.

It did not go into production. Design and development The Albatross was the first Japanese motorized glider, unusual in being powered by a ducted fan. Design work started in late 1973 and the first flight of the NP-100 prototype was made on 25 December 1975. After a period of testing in 1976 led to several modifications and a change of name to NP-100A. There was another period of testing in the second quarter of 1978 to finalize the configuration and power plant of production aircraft. Despite this, the Albatross was not put into production. Apart from its power unit, the Albatross was a fairly conventional high-wing monoplane glider. Its wing was an all-metal, single-spar structure and of unswept, straight-tapered plan. There were plain ailerons and two-part flaps; the inboard and outboard sections of the flaps were linked, but the inboard part had greater deflections and could be used as an air brake. The tail surfaces were also all-metal and straight-tapered; the horizontal surfaces were mounted on top of the fuselage. The fuselage was a standard all- metal semi-monocoque, with the side-by-side seats under a long, low rearward- sliding two-piece canopy, with its rear at the wing leading edge. The Albatross's undercarriage had two main wheels side by side, attached to the fuselage and retracting forward into it. Its tail wheel was steerable via the rudder bar. A modified motorcycle engine, located in the centre of the fuselage, drove a four-blade wooded ducted fan. This drew in air through intakes in the fuselage sides with slatted doors, closed when the engine was off, and exhausted ventrally just behind the trailing edge under the slender rear fuselage.

Objects can enter the esophagus through the mouth, or enter the trachea through the mouth or nose.  Signs and symptoms  Signs and symptoms of foreign body aspiration vary based on the site of obstruction, the size of the foreign body, and the severity of obstruction. 20% of foreign bodies become lodged in the upper airway, while 80% become lodged in the mainstem or lobar bronchus. Signs of foreign body aspiration are usually abrupt in onset with coughing, choking, and/or wheezing; however, symptoms can be slower in onset if the foreign body does not cause a large degree of obstruction of the airway. Classically, patients present with acute onset of choking. In these cases, the obstruction is classified as a partial or complete obstruction. Signs of partial obstruction include choking with drooling, stridor, and the patient maintains the ability to speak. Signs of complete obstruction include choking with inability to speak or cough, and signs of respiratory distress such as cyanosis. Foreign bodies above the larynx often present with stridor, while objects below the larynx present with wheezing. Foreign bodies above the vocal cords often present with difficulty and pain with swallowing and excessive drooling. Foreign bodies below the vocal cords often present with pain and difficulty with speaking and breathing. Increased respiratory rate may be the only sign of foreign body aspiration in a child who cannot verbalize or report if they have swallowed a foreign body. If the foreign body does not cause a large degree of obstruction, patients may present with chronic cough, asymmetrical breath sounds on exam, or recurrent pneumonia of a specific lung lobe. The right lower lobe of the lung is the most common site of recurrent pneumonia in foreign body aspiration. This is due to the fact that the anatomy of the right main bronchus is wider and steeper than that of the left main bronchus, allowing objects to enter more easily than the left side. Signs and symptoms of foreign body aspiration in adults can sometimes mimic other lung disorders such as asthma, COPD, and lung cancer.  Complications  Many complications can develop after a foreign body is removed, or if a foreign body remains in the airway. Patients may develop inflammation of the airway walls or lung abscess from a foreign body remaining in the airway. Hyperinflation of the airway distal to the obstruction can also occur if the foreign body is not removed. Patients can also develop pneumonia from retained foreign bodies. Episodes of recurrent pneumonia in the same lung field should prompt evaluation for a possible foreign body in the airway. Even if the foreign body is removed, complications such as chemical bronchitis, mucosal reactions, and the development of granulation tissue are possible. Complications can also arise from interventions used to remove a foreign body from the airway. Rigid bronchoscopy is the gold standard for removal of a foreign body, however this intervention does have potential risks. The most common complication from rigid bronchoscopy is damage to the patient's teeth. Other less common complications include cuts to the mouth or esophagus, and damage to the vocal cords. Causes Section of larynx showing aspirated fragment of meat Most cases of foreign body aspiration are in children ages 6 months to 3 years due to the tendency for children to place small objects in the mouth and nose. Children of this age usually lack molars and cannot grind up food into small pieces for proper swallowing. Small, round objects including nuts, hard candy, popcorn kernels, beans, and berries are common causes of foreign body aspiration. Latex balloons are also a serious choking hazard in children that can result in death. A latex balloon will conform to the shape of the trachea, blocking the airway and making it difficult to expel with the Heimlich maneuver. In adults, foreign body aspiration is most prevalent in populations with impaired swallowing mechanisms such as the following: neurological disorders, alcohol use, sedative use, advanced age (most common in the 6th decade of life), and loss of consciousness.  Diagnosis  Foreign body aspiration of a coin If foreign body aspiration is suspected, finger sweeping in the mouth is not recommended due to the increased risk of displacing the foreign object further into the airway. Most patients receive a chest x-ray to determine the location of the foreign body. However, a negative chest x-ray cannot rule out foreign body aspiration. Lateral neck, chest, and bilateral decubitus end-expiratory chest x-rays should be obtained in patients suspected of having aspirated a foreign body. Signs on x-ray that can be indicative of foreign body aspiration include visualization of the foreign body or hyperinflation of the affected lung. Other x-ray findings that can be seen with foreign body aspiration include obstructive emphysema, atelectasis, and consolidation. While, x-ray can be used to visualize the location and identity of a foreign body, rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia is the gold-standard for diagnosis since the foreign body can be visualized and removed with this intervention. Rigid bronchoscopy is indicated when two of the three following criteria are met: report of foreign body aspiration by the patient or a witness, abnormal lung exam findings, or abnormal chest x-ray findings.  Treatment  Treatment of foreign body aspiration is determined by the severity of obstruction of the airway involved. In partial obstruction, the patient can usually clear the foreign body with coughing. In complete obstruction, acute intervention is required to remove the foreign body. For choking children less than 1 year of age, the child should be placed face down over the rescuer's arm. Back blows should be delivered with the heel of the hand, then the patient should be turned face-up and chest thrusts should be administered. The rescuer should alternate five back blows followed by five chest thrusts until the object is cleared. The Heimlich maneuver should be used in choking patients older than 1 year of age to dislodge a foreign body. If the patient becomes unresponsive during physical intervention, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be started. In the event that the above measures do not remove the foreign body, and adequate ventilation cannot be restored, need for treatment by trained personnel becomes necessary. Laryngoscopy should be performed in unresponsive patients if non-invasive airway clearance techniques are unsuccessful. Laryngoscopy involves placing a device in the mouth to visualize the back of the airway. If the foreign body can be seen, it can be removed with forceps. An endotracheal tube should then be placed in order to prevent airway compromise from resulting inflammation after the procedure. If the foreign body cannot be visualized, intubation, tracheotomy, or needle cricothyrotomy can be done to restore an airway for patients who have become unresponsive due to airway compromise. If non-invasive measures do not dislodge the foreign body, and the patient can maintain adequate ventilation, rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia should be performed. Supplemental oxygen, cardiac monitoring, and a pulse oximeter should be applied to the patient. Efforts should be made to keep the patient calm and avoid agitating the patient to prevent further airway compromise. After the foreign body is removed, patients should receive nebulized beta-adrenergic medication and chest physiotherapy to further protect the airway.

Only one was constructed; much modified during the 1980s, it was still flying in 1990. Design and development Hans U. Farner was an innovative Swiss aircraft designer whose footlaunched canard ultralight sailplane had briefly reached production in 1966. In November 1974 he filed a patent for a novel control system, particularly suitable for canards. This suggested mounting the canard on a slender tube which slid snugly within a second long forward tube that, together with a pod containing an engine, pilot and bearing mainplanes, formed the fuselage. Extension of the canard-carrying tube by means of fore and aft control column movement increased the canard's moment arm and increased pitch. The angle of attack of the canard was automatically altered as this happened. Rotating the tube about its long axis by rudder pedal movement turned the canard away from the horizontal and caused yaw, removing the need for a vertical rudder. Wing mounted ailerons controlled roll in the usual way. The Farner HF Colibri 1 SL motor glider, designed, built and test flown by Hans Farner in the late 1970s embodied these ideas. It had a very high aspect ratio (31.7) wing with a constant chord centre section carrying dihedral. Outer panels, with anhedral, combined with the inner section to form a cantilever gull wing. These outer panels had straight taper on the leading edges only, and rotated as all-moving ailerons or \\"tiperons\\" for roll control. The wing was mounted on top of a narrow fuselage pod, with the pilot under a rear hinged canopy well forward of its leading edge. The Colibri was a twin engined motor glider, with two single cylinder two stroke McCulloch MC-101A, each of driving a two blade pusher configuration propeller via reduction gear and a high positioned shaft, just below and a little way behind the trailing edge. Under the drive shaft the fuselage remained deep but tapered rearwards into two door like aerofoils with straight, vertical trailing edges that could be opened symmetrically outwards as an airbrake. Positioned well behind the centre of gravity, they closed together as the only fin. Forward of the cockpit the fuselage curved gently upwards into a tubular, straight, tapering, rising boom. The parallel chord, unswept, high aspect ratio canard, carried on its constant diameter tube in the manner described in the patent, providing lift and both yaw and pitch control. The first flight date is uncertain but the Colibri was complete by late 1979. The written record post-1980 is sparse but photographs show it was still flying in 1990, when it appeared at a display in Belgium. It had visited the UK in 1989, coming to the PFA meeting at Cranfield. During the 1980s it had undergone considerable modification to the novel control system, with high aspect ratio, swept fins on the wings first at the outer end of the centre section, just before the start of the rotating tiperons, and then at the wing tips. These images suggest that conventional flight control surfaces were added to both fore and aft wings as well as to the fins. The extensible fuselage also seems to have been abandoned by 1989.

Biography Andr√© Liohn lived in Botucatu, Brazil during his childhood. In his early 20s, he moved to Trondheim, Norway where he lived for 15 years. He started photographing at the age of 30. In his first years in photography, he met the Czech photographer Anton√≠n Kratochv√≠l who became his personal friend and mentor, influencing his work and his views about photography. In 2011 he became the first Latin American photojournalist to receive the prestigious Robert Capa Gold Medal by the Overseas Press Club for his work on the Libyan Civil War and nominated by the Prix Bayeux-Calvados des Correspondants de Guerre. His work documenting the challenges faced by health care personal working in conflict areas has been used by the ICRC's Health Care in Danger project, denouncing cases violence against health care personal around the world Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting In April 2010, Liohn made public the case where the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting grantee and World Press Photo winner, Marco Vernaschi, requested a Ugandan mother to exhume her recently deceased child, offering payment after the fact. Liohn learned about the case after visiting Uganda to report on cases of human sacrifices and after observing vague photo captions written by Vernaschi, that he was not present at the time of burial and had, in essence, staged a photo and offered payment in return. After notifying the Pulitzer Center and the photojournalist Anne Holmes, who subsequently removed an interview with Vernaschi that had previously been on her blog, Liohn went public on the journalist's forum Lightstalkers. The story drew more attention when Roy Greenslade wrote it up in The Guardian. As of October 2011, the Pulitzer Center remains firmly behind Vernaschi's work, although it has withdrawn several images from this and another story (where questions were raised about the ethics of showing the face and genitalia of a child who had suffered genital mutilation) and hosted a debate and discussion about the photographer's working methods, journalistic integrity, and professional ethics. ADIL - Almost Dawn in Libya In 2012, with fellow photographers Christopher Morris, Jehad Nga, Bryan Denton, Lynsey Addario, Eric Bouvet and Finbarr O'Reilly, he created the project Almost Dawn in Libya, four photo exhibits in the main Libyan cities of Tripoli, Benghazi, Misurata and Zintan. The project gained great media coverage and was funded partly by a crowdfunding campaign hosted by the website Emphas.is and partly by the international NGO International Medical Corps. The project's idea was to use photojournalism as a possible bridge for reconciliation in Libya after its civil war. The exhibits were curated by Italian curator Annalisa D'Angelo and photographer Paolo Pellegrin. Political Views Andr√© Liohn follows the Mutualism (economic theory) political and economic theory originated from the writings of philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon.

He has been involved with several human rights organisations and projects, and is working as a research assistant with the Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies in Abuja. Early life and education Effoduh was born in Lagos on 12 December 1987. In 1992, his family moved to Abuja where he attended primary school. For secondary school, he attended Federal Government College in Minna, Niger. At University of Abuja, he studied civil law and was involved as a president of several student organisations including the student magazine, human rights club, Red Cross Society, and International Humanitarian Law Advocates. He got his Diploma of Law in 2006. He received his LL.B in public and international law in 2010, and became a founding partner of the school's \\"pro bono\\" office, which participated in several national and international law competitions, including one from Network of University Legal Aid Institution (NULAI). He went on to attend Nigerian Law School and was admitted to the Nigerian Bar Association in February 2012. Radio Effoduh was a fan of BBC Media Action (BBC World Service Trust); when he heard that they were auditioning for a male presenter for a new show called Flava, he tried out and was eventually selected from 62 candidates. He originally freelanced as a radio presenter for the programme to help finance his university education, but it had also increased his desires to help the community. From 2006 to 2013, he anchored Flava, a youth lifestyle and sexual reproductive health magazine programme where he addressed issues on HIV/AIDS among others. Effoduh has noted that Flava grew to broadcast on 103 radio stations in Nigeria, and is one of the most popular radio programmes in the West Africa region. It also gave him an opportunity to travel to all 36 states of Nigeria, as well as 214 local government areas. In November 2012, Effoduh was recognised as the Best Community Show Presenter at the 2012 Nigeria Radio Awards. In January 2013, Effoduh began hosting a new programme, Talk Your Own: Make Naija Better (Talk Your Own Make Nigeria Better) a 30-minute show covering governance issues in Nigeria. It has aired on over a hundred stations, with the aim of a more inclusive and wider listener base. He also noted that BBC Media Action wanted to train radio presenters to produce and host more localised shows. Legal work For his National Youth Service Corps primary assignmentEffoduh's assignment for the National Youth Service Corps took place from November 2011 to November 2012. In 2013, he became a research assistant with the Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies. Activism In August 2011, Effoduh spent three weeks in the quarters of the sex worker community in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) of Nigeria, where he researched the human rights abuses faced by that population. He presented \\"Legal Protection of Sex Workers: a need to achieving effective HIV/AIDS intervention in the sex worker population of Nigeria\\" as a poster exhibition at the XIX International AIDS Conference held in Washington, DC in July 2012. He also presented his information at the TEDxAbuja conference in October. In June 2012, he was invited by the United States Department of State to be the Nigerian representative and one of 20 journalists from 20 countries for a global reporting tour. The objective was to give journalists firsthand experience on key LGBT and other human rights issues in America, and it included a tour of the offices of the US Foreign Press Center.> He has published a series of articles of his experience there.Articles by Effoduh during visit to US:  * Effoduh has been involved with the Sickle Cell Aid Foundation (SCAF), established in 2010 as a non-governmental organisation (NGO) for the aid and support of indigent persons diagnosed with sickle cell anaemia in Nigeria. SCAF has set up sickle cell clubs in many secondary schools; in 2011 they donated drugs to local hospitals in the FCT and campaigned for better educating the public on sickle cell anaemia. In 2012, he introduced the Know Your Genotype campaign, which provides free genotype testing for one million Nigerians. He serves as the organisation's vice-president. He was nominated for The Future Awards Africa for his advocacy work in 2013. In 2017, Effoduh moderated a panel at Oxford University's OAC Breaking the Frame[works] conference at the Blavatnik School of Government, discussing the changing state of the African continent, on the topics of media transformation and technology. He was part of the initialing of monumental heirloom the Philosopher's Legacy. Personal life Effoduh's family is Catholic, but he has mentioned that his childhood friends were Muslims from the north, so he enjoyed the food and culture there. Effoduh currently lives in Abuja, Nigeria. In a September 2012 interview where he is asked his relationship status, he replied, \\"I am in a relationship and I don't think it is distracting. It actually lowers my gaze and keeps me responsible.\\" In a January 2014 interview, he mentioned he was single and does not have a ring on his finger.

In this procedure, an intensifying dynamic excitation is used as the loading function. Endurance time method is a time- history based dynamic analysis procedure. An estimate of the structural response at different equivalent seismic intensity levels is obtained in a single response history analysis. This method has applications in seismic assessment of various structural types and in different areas of earthquake engineering.  The concept of endurance time method  Endurance time (ET) method is a dynamic structural analysis procedure in which intensifying dynamic excitation is used as the loading function. An estimate of structural response and/or performance at the entire seismic intensity range of interest is obtained in each response history analysis. The concept of endurance time analysis is similar to the exercise test applied in medicine. Similar concept has also been extended to applications in the analysis of offshore platforms under water waves.  Development history  The basic concepts of the endurance time method were published in 2004. Application in linear seismic analysis appeared in 2007. ET was subsequently extended to nonlinear analysis of single degree of freedom (SDOF) and multi degree of freedom systems. Procedures for multi-component seismic analysis were subsequently developed.  ET excitation functions  ET excitation functions are generated by using numerical optimization methods. ET excitation functions are publicly available through internet websites. ET excitation functions are categorized into four generations as follows: # First generation of ET excitation functions (ETEFs) are essentially a filtered and profiled white noise. These were used for demonstrating the concept of ET and have limited practical significance. # Second-generation ETEFs incorporate response spectrum matching. These ETEFs produce numerically significant analysis results. # Third-generation ETEFs are optimized in nonlinear range. These ETEFs deliver improved analysis performance. # Fourth-generation ETEFs are optimized to include duration consistency. Fig. 1. A typical endurance time excitation function (ETA20f03 record)  Application areas in earthquake engineering  Endurance time method has been applied in the following areas of earthquake engineering: * Nonlinear dynamic analysis of structures * Seismic evaluation of jacket-type offshore platforms * Optimal damper placement in framed buildings * Seismic assessment of structures * Performance-based design * Structural optimization * Multi-component seismic analysis * Soil‚Äìstructure interaction * soil-pile- superstructure interaction * Liquid‚Äìstructure interaction * Dam engineering * Bridge engineering * Seismic rehabilitation * Collapse analysis  Structural type applications  ET method has been applied in seismic assessment of the following structural types: * Single degree of freedom systems * Moment and braced steel frames * Concrete frames * Bridges * Gravity dams * Arch dams * Shell structures * Steel tanks * Offshore structures  Advantages of ET method  Major advantages of the endurance time method are as follows: * ET significantly reduces the computational demand required for performing a standard response history analysis of structures for seismic assessment, especially when response at multiple levels of intensity is to be considered. * ET is applicable in a wide range of seismic assessment problems and provides a generic approach for the seismic analysis of a wide range of structural types. * ET method is reasonably simple and sensible when a realistic dynamic analysis of a complex structure is required  Limitations of ET method  Major limitations of the endurance time method are as follows: * ET is an approximate method for predicting the structural response. * The production of usable ETEFs that are applicable in a particular situation can be complicated. * The procedure is still under development and sufficient background information may not be available for specific applications.

In his open letter, he highlighted the ugly impact their actions would have on Nigeria's effort to curb HIV/AIDS. The widely read letter was published on different media platforms with excerpts from the letter appearing in an article in the renowned UK magazine The Economist. In 2013, Stephen became the youngest at the time to be awarded a scholarship to do a fellowship at the Faculty of Law University of York in England. During his time in England, he was invited to a breakfast with the Mayor of York to discuss his work and general human rights issues in Nigeria and the African region. Stephen is also regarded as a refreshing public speaker and has spoken to young girls at the Mount school in York United Kingdom. He was one of the speakers at the Langwith College International Action Week and gave a very well received public talk on sexual rights to professors and students of the faculty of law University of York England. Stephen speaks at international conferences, workshops, trainings and has spoken at the highly acclaimed University of Maryland, USA. He facilitates sessions and workshops at international and local trainings including a session at the 2012 International AIDS conference youth pre-conference. Stephen travels the world working on human rights and sexual health issues and he writes on topics that he is passionate about. He writes about social issues in Nigeria through articles on Jungle Justice, Gender Equality. and an Open Letter to Governor Abiola Ajimobi of Oyo state in south-westerm Nigeria. In November 2016, Stephen Chukwumah was selected as DyNAMC Magazine's Leader for a Changing World and was featured on the front page of their November issue. Acting and dancing Stephen started acting as a hobby at a young age at home and in church and would then proceed to becoming very popular in secondary school for participating in drama presentations. As a teenager, he started dancing professionally with a dance group in Lagos and they performed at different events and cities in Nigeria. Stephen through his work with Youth Abalaze in Nigeria was featured in a campus soap-opera \\"Evanessence\\" but has since been unreleased. Human rights activism Stephen Chukwumah is an internationally recognised human rights activist. His involvement with human rights work started in school with advocating for the rights of students which led him into hiding in a remote village in Edo state Nigeria for two weeks after participating in a student protest and challenging the state government on television for increasing school fees. In 2007 he started a youth organisation that provides sexual health and human rights information and services to young sexual minorities. Stephen through his organisation Improved Youth Health Initiative, continues to provide human rights and HIV/AIDS information and services to young minorities with funding and technical support from MTV Staying Alive Foundation and Advocates for Youth.

The recruit training battalion is responsible ensuring that each company is following the procedures set forth by the Recruit Training Regiment. Each company is responsible to follow the standards established by the Commandant of the Marine Corps to train, teach, mentor, and above all lead recruits through a demanding standard-based training system. 51% of all male Marines attend recruit training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego, California. Mission Provide reception, processing, and recruit training for male enlisted personnel following initial entry into the Marine Corps. History In 1921, the MCRDSD was formally commissioned and in 1923, it became the primary recruiting center for the west coast. During World War II, the flow of recruits into the base surged, with 18,000 recruits arriving in one month.[1] In 1948, the base was formally named Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego and was home to the Recruit Training Regiment. The 3d Battalion‚Äôs main mission is to train new United States Marine Corps recruits, specifically males recruited from west of the Mississippi River, but also from some areas east of the river, such as Wisconsin, Michigan, the Chicago metropolitan area and New Orleans. Recruit training includes a thirteen-week process during which the recruit becomes cut off from the civilian world and must adapt to a Marine Corps lifestyle. During training, drill instructors train recruits in a wide variety of subjects including weapons training, Marine Corps Martial Arts Program, personal hygiene and cleanliness, close order drill, and Marine Corps history. The training emphasizes physical fitness, and recruits must attain a minimum standard of fitness to graduate by passing a Physical Fitness Test. Recruits must also meet minimum combat- oriented swimming qualifications, qualify in rifle marksmanship with the M16A4 service rifle, and pass a 54-hour simulated combat exercise known as \\"The Crucible\\". Unlike training at Parris Island, recruits must leave the depot to conduct field training. Three weeks of the recruit‚Äôs training is spent at Edson Range aboard Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, where recruits fire on the rifle range, conduct field training, and undergo the Crucible. At the conclusion, recruits return to MCRD San Diego for graduation.

It's a multilateration method in which the User Equipment (UE) measures the time difference between some specific signals from several eNodeBs and reports these time differences to a specific device in the network (the ESMLC). The ESMLC based on these time differences and knowledge of the enodeBs locations calculates the UEs' position.  Background  In December 2008, due to regulatory requirements like the E911, which require that it should be possible to locate UEs with a certain accuracy, a work item was proposed in the 3GPP TSG-RAN42 meeting.Positioning Support for LTE This proposed between others the study of the feasibility of OTDOA. OTDOA was meant to work in a similar way as the 3G IPL feature. During the summer of 2009 the necessary changes to the RAN1 36.211,3GPP TS 36.211 E-UTRA Physical channels and modulation 36.212,3GPP TS 36.212 E-UTRA Multiplexing and channel coding 36.2133GPP TS 36.213 E-UTRA Physical layer procedures and 36.2143GPP TS 36.214 E-UTRA Physical layer; Measurements specifications were accepted. And a bit later the RAN4E-UTRA Requirements for support of radio resource management requirements and RAN2E-UTRA LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP) protocol related matters settled.  Technology  A OTDOA procedure works as follows: The ESMLC requests through the LPP layer an OTDOA measurement: a set of RSTD (Reference Signal Time Difference) measurements from the UE. Together with this request the UE receives assistance data. This assistance data, provides a list of cells (enodeBs), with their PRS (Positioning Reference Signal) parameters, including BW, periodicity etc. The UE then proceeds to perform these measurements during a given period of time (typically up to 8 or 16 periods of the PRS signals). These measurements consist on estimating the exact time offsets between the PRS from different cells. Then it reports to the ESMLC these estimated time differences together with an estimate of the measurement quality. The ESMLC then, using these time difference estimates, and the knowledge of the cells positions and transmit time offsets estimates the position of the UE. The description of the LPP (LTE positioning protocol) can be found in the 36.355 specification. The exact details of the PRS signals can be found in section 6.10.4 of the 36.211 specification. And a simple OTDOA procedure can be found in the RAN5 OTDOA testcases' descriptions in section 9 of the 37.571-1 specification3GPP TS 37.571-1 E-UTRA UE conformance specification; for UE positioning; Part 1: Conformance test specification From a UE architecture perspective the LPP layer resides outside of the EUTRAN protocol stack, over NAS, but typically implemented in the cellular modem firmware. The UE RSTD measurements themselves would be performed by the L1 layer.  Adoption  OTDOA is an optional feature in the 3GPP LTE standard. This means that is optional for networks and UEs to support it while still being deemed LTE compatible. Like with other similar optional features, interest by particular carriers depends on regulatory requirements, and for UE vendors in carrier's requirements, as major carriers run their own certification tests on UEs which aim at operating in their network.ATT certification  References   External links  * Ericsson-Positioning with LTE * NSN Performance of 3GPP Rel-9 LTE positioning methods Category:3GPP standards ","title":"OTDOA"},{"id":"38022583","text":"Lady Urmia () is an Iranian documentary film by Mohammad Ehsani.

It operated from 1966 until Namibian independence in 1990 from different hosting stations in Sub-Saharan Africa. Background and establishment After World War I the League of Nations gave South West Africa, formerly a German colony, to the United Kingdom as a mandate under the title of South Africa. When the National Party won the 1948 election in South Africa and subsequently introduced apartheid legislation, these laws also extended into South West Africa which was the de facto fifth province of South Africa. On 19 April 1960 SWAPO was founded as the successor of the Ovamboland People's Organization that was established in 1959. During 1962 SWAPO had emerged as the dominant nationalist organisation for the Namibian people, co-opting other groups such as the South West Africa National Union (SWANU), and in 1976 the Namibia African People's Democratic Organisation.Peter H. Katjavivi A History of Resistance in Namibia, Page 99, SWAPO used guerrilla tactics to fight the South African military. On 26 August 1966 the first major clash of the conflict took place, when a unit of the South African Police, supported by South African Air Force, exchanged fire with SWAPO forces at Omugulugwombashe. This date is generally regarded as the start of what became known in South Africa as the Border War. Voice of Namibia was part of the propaganda wing of SWAPO. It started with a one-hour program called Namibian Hour that was broadcast from Tanzania in 1966. Radio Zambia began relaying the Namibian Hour as from 1973, and the following year the program was renamed Voice of Namibia. Luanda joined the hosting stations in 1976. Further stations hosting Voice of Namibia were Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, the Voice of Revolutionary Ethiopia, and Voice of the Revolution from Congo-Brazzaville. Operation and reception VoN was the counter- propaganda station to the South West African Broadcasting Corporation (SWABC), the South African Broadcasting Corporation outpost in South West Africa. Throughout the 1980s VoN established a network of freelance journalists within South West Africa. Unlike other pirate stations that promoted independence in Sub-Saharan Africa it was thus able to keep contact with the local population, a property that positively influenced its reception in the target territory. Further sources of information for the Voice of Namibia were faxes and telephone calls to its London office, and clandestine courier services to Angola via Ovamboland. When the Namibia Press Agency (NAMPA) was established in 1987 as a press agency of SWAPO, news updates were telexed to all VoN dependencies after being cleared by SWAPO. Voice of Namibia had a large local audience among the black population, particularly due to technical reasons: Weak local radio offerings before the 1970s had caused the spread of short wave radio sets which were better suited to receive international channels than the FM sets predominant in South Africa. When Radio Owambo, an FM channel destined for the indigenous Ovambo people, was started in 1969, it could not change the already existing regular practice of assessing radio offerings on the short wave band. Namibian independence Upon Namibian independence in March 1990, the South West African Broadcasting Corporation (SWABC) was renamed as the Namibia Broadcasting Corporation (NBC), and VoN was merged into it. The NBC was officially disassociated from SWAPO and declared an independent state broadcaster. However, staff from SWABC stayed on and former SWABC personnel had to be reconciled with returning VoN partisan journalists, which created considerable tensions. Notable staff A number of journalists and administrators at VoN became high-ranking politicians after Namibian independence, among them: * Eddie Amkongo, former ambassador to Ethiopia, as well as the Democratic Republic of the CongoGraham Hopwood: Who's Who: Amkongo, Eddie Shimwethelini - Civil servant at Namibia Institute for Democracy, 2007 * Moses «ÅGaro√´b (1942‚Äì1997), Minister of Labour and Human Resources * Joseph Obgeb Jimmy (1951‚Äì2004), Namibia's first High Commissioner to Zambia * Kazenambo Kazenambo, former Namibian Minister of Youth, National Service, Sport and CultureGraham Hopwood: Who's Who: Kazenambo Kazenambo - Swapo at Namibia Institute for Democracy, 2007 * Doreen Sioka, Minister of Labour and Social Welfare * Ponhele ya France, former president of the National Union of Namibian Workers (NUNW) and former Member of Parliament See also * Voice of Zimbabwe * Voice of the Revolution (Zimbabwe) * Radio Freedom (South Africa) References Category:Community radio stations in Namibia Category:Defunct radio stations Category:Anti-Apartheid organisations Category:Pirate radio stations Category:SWAPO Category:South African Border War Category:Radio stations established in 1966 ","title":"Voice of Namibia"},{"id":"38022590","text":"Angustalius philippiellus is a moth of the Crambinae family described by Pierre Viette in 1970.

Spiegel was the youngest billionaire in the world in 2015. Early life and education Spiegel was born in Los Angeles, California, to lawyers John W. Spiegel and Melissa Ann Thomas. He grew up in Pacific Palisades, California, where he was raised Episcopalian. He was educated at the Crossroads School for Arts and Sciences in Santa Monica, and attended Stanford University. Spiegel took design classes at the Otis College of Art and Design while still in high school and at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena the summer before entering Stanford. He also had an unpaid internship in sales at Red Bull. While a student, he worked as a paid intern for a biomedical company, as a careers instructor in Cape Town, South Africa, and at Intuit on the TxtWeb project. Spiegel is a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. Career 238x238px In April 2011, while studying product design at Stanford, Spiegel proposed an app with ephemeral messaging as a product design class project, an idea which his classmates ridiculed. Later that year, Spiegel worked with fellow Stanford classmates Bobby Murphy and Reggie Brown to launch a prototype of this concept called \\"Picaboo\\", which they later renamed as Snapchat. The app's popularity grew significantly and in 2012, Evan left Stanford to focus on Snapchat shortly before completing his degree. By the end of 2012, Spiegel's Snapchat app had reached 1 million daily active users. In February 2017, Spiegel and Murphy pledged to donate upwards of 13,000,000 shares of Class A common stock over the next 15‚Äì20 years to an arts, education and youth non-profit. They have created the Snap Foundation which is a non-profit organization targeted to help in these areas. Their mission is to \\"develop pathways to the creative economy for underrepresented youths in Los Angeles.\\" Recently they have donated $3 million to people affected by COVID-19. In January 2017 The Wall Street Journal reported that after the predicted March 2017 IPO for Snap Inc., Murphy and Evan Spiegel would hold over \\"70% of the voting power\\" in the company, and own around 45% of the total stock.

The San Rafael Fire Department serves an estimated population of 59,000 people with approximately 70 firefighting and emergency medical field personnel. The ISO Class 1 department responds to, on average, approximately 8,800 emergency calls annually, with about 70% being emergency medical calls. EMS patients are transported to the hospital of their choice, unless the call is urgent. The department staffs six stations with 23 personnel daily. Strategically located throughout the city are five frontline engines, an aerial ladder truck, two frontline ambulances, and a battalion chief each shift. An additional engine is cross-staffed by the crew of the frontline truck, and two additional ambulances and are cross- staffed by the crews of an Engine 55 and Engine 56. County wide mutual aid provides relief and additional support during large scale incidents and during high call volume. Because the majority (70%) of calls are EMS related, a paramedic is onboard all engines. Also, one additional ambulance is stored at Station 55 (Medic 55) and another at Station 56 (Medic 56). While these units are not staffed full-time, they are cross-staffed by the crew of the engine companies and can respond if Medic 52 and Medic 57 are committed to other calls. In 2017, the department responded to 8,841 total calls, up from 7,041 in 2012. History The San Rafael Fire Department was first organized on December 5, 1874 when William Miller and J.B. Rice posted a notice in the Marin County Journal, calling for volunteer firemen. The organization was first named the \\"San Rafael Hose Company Number One\\" but was then renamed the \\"San Rafael Hose, Hook and Ladder Company\\" to show the range of their equipment. There were 45 volunteers from a variety of trades including a justice of the peace and a school superintendent and were led by sheriff James Tunstede. Their first major appliance was a hose cart which was pulled by hand to a hydrant. The water supply of San Rafael used gravity to provide pressure and so a pump was not required. By the 1890s, the Company had 90 volunteer members, two hand pulled hose carts, two hose carriages and one hook and ladder wagon that was pulled by a rented team of horses when needed. In 1945, the first full-time Fire Chief, Fred Schueuer was hired. In the mid-1980s, the first fire station had to be remodeled and upgraded. In that era, there was one station in San Rafael with 250 hydrants and 15 paid firefighters as well as a host of volunteers. In 2008, led by firefighter Dave Holland, the San Rafael Fire Department upgraded its fire engines with the installation of solar panels on the vehicles. The electricity generated would be used to power computers, flashlights, and other equipment on the fire engine, so as to avoid depleting the vehicle's batteries or wasting fuel to recharge the batteries. Fire Station 51 in June 2014.thumbThe San Rafael Fire Department has a signed agreement with the fire department of the community of Marinwood to pool together their equipment and facilitate the exchange of employees to make up for any labor shortages at any of the fire departments. Larkspur and San Rafael announced that they intended to merge the administrative structures of both fire departments, though legally, the employees would still be considered employees of the fire department that hired them. The Department is updating or reconstructing many of its stations. In 2016, plans were released for a brand new fire station 51 and 52. Stations 54, 55 and 57 would be dramatically remodeled. While this is happening, many new apparatus have been acquired, moving from a yellow color scheme to a more classic, red. The department took delivery of a 105' Pierce arial ladder truck in late 2015, and two Pierce engines in 2017. These apparatus are red, consistent with two 2013 KME engines, and three 2018 Ford Horton ambulances. In 2020, the department took delivery of an additional red, 2019 Pierce engine. With this delivery, each station's frontline apparatus is now red. In October 2017, the 100 year old station 51 was torn down in the process of the new public safety building, set to open in late 2019. In April of 2019, new Fire Station 52 was opened, housing Engine 52 and Medic 52 (renamed from Medic 51). In November of 2019, new Fire Station 57 opened, housing Engine 57, Medic 57 (renamed from Medic 53), Engine 652, Utility 57 and an ATV to use in near by China Camp State park. Notable Incidents and Awards  In 2013, the department was praised for rescuing a horse which had fallen into a well. Water was pumped into the well to float the animal to the surface where a crane was then used to lift it out. The department was granted an ISO Class 1 rating, the highest level available, in 2016.  Station & Apparatus locations  The SRFD has 6 stations spread across the city. Station 55 and Station 56 are cross-staffed with the 3rd/4th out ambulances. Additional reserve apparatus, including a truck and multiple medic units, are kept at the city maintenance yard. { wikitable style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! Station ! Address !

The enodeB may report extra information to the ESMLC like the angle of arrival. The ESMLC estimates the UE position based on this information and its knowledge of the cells positions. Cell ID based methods were already possible before rel9. Enhanced cell ID aggregates together some already available measurements, some of them with increased accuracy requirements to improve the positioning accuracy capabilities.  Technology  Similarly to an OTDOA procedure, a E-CID procedure is initiated through the LPPE-UTRA LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP) protocol by the ESMLC, with a ECID- RequestLocationInformation request message. The UE performs and collects the necessary measurements, and reports them back using the ECID- ProvideLocationInformation. This message contains a list with the following details, depending on the UE capability, for each cell it detected: * The Cell ID of the cell. * RSRP (reference signals received power) measurement: A measurement of the received power level. * RSRQ (reference signals received quality) measurement: A measurement of the received quality (SNR). * Rx-Tx time difference (only for the serving cell): An estimation of the time difference between its reception and transmission time at the UE antenna, that is the time difference between the start of a DL subframe and the transmission of the corresponding UL subframe.

Established in 1972, it is the first of ten villages developed in The Woodlands. Its namesake is the Grogan-Cochran Lumber Company, the last sawmill to operate in the area. It consists of approximately 5,100 homes and 13,000 residents in 22 neighborhoods and over 50 businesses. Its most notable amenity is The Woodlands Resort & Conference Center and most notable resident was George P. Mitchell.  History  Before Spanish Texas, Mexican Texas, and the Republic of Texas, the Grogan's Mill territory was likely inhabited by the Bidai. From the 1850s to 1950s, the territory was closely linked to the history of the timber industry in Montgomery County, which had more sawmills than any other county in East Texas. From 1918 to 1964, the Grogan Cochran Lumber Company operated the final mill in the area before selling 2,800 acres to George Mitchell. Mitchell acquired an additional 14,655 acres over the ensuing years for the development of a planned community called The Woodlands. Development of Grogan's Mill, the first of ten villages, began in the fall of 1972. The Information Center was finished in 1973 and the Wharf and Conference Center (today as The Woodlands Resort) was finished in late 1974. Growth stalled until 1976 due to the 1970s energy crisis. Development of The Woodlands first estate neighborhoods began in 1980. Initially envisioned as an equestrian community, Grogan's Point became the model for estate neighborhoods later villages would follow.  Governance  Grogan's Mill Village is administered by the Grogan's Mill Village Association (GMVA), which falls under the governance of The Woodlands Township, a special-purpose district created by the 73rd Texas Legislature in 1993. The Woodlands is not a city nor a traditional township government, however it still provides limited municipal government services such as trash pickup, parks and recreation, covenant enforcement, fire and rescue services, streetscaping, economic development, and enhanced law enforcement and security patrols. The Grogan's Mill Village Association provides a forum for village- centric civic and social issues and opportunities. All residents over the age of 18 are members of the association who are able to elect its 15 governing officers, whom are governed by the association bylaws.  Committees  GMVA maintains committees, which are support by a chairman and at least one member, and report to the GMVA board.

One of the 71 passengers and a motorcyclist on the ground were killed; ten more people were seriously injured.  History of the flight  The Fokker 100 had departed Yangon International Airport in the morning of 25 December on its first leg to Mandalay International Airport. The aircraft was refuelled at Mandalay, and at 08:26 local time departed towards Heho Airport. The first officer was designated as the Pilot Flying for the leg.  Accident  On approaching Heho, the air traffic control passed to the crew the local weather conditions as wind calm, visibility 3000 m and \\"distinct fog.\\" At about 08:47 local time, the crew initiated a non-precision NDB approach procedure to Heho's runway 36. During the final inbound track, the aircraft descended prematurely, and at about from the runway threshold it struck power lines and trees, before colliding with terrain across a road. In the collision, both wings separated and a fire quickly broke out. An emergency evacuation was carried out. One aircraft occupant and a passing motorcyclist were fatally injured.  Investigation  The aircraft's flight recorders were sent to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau for analysis. Initial statements by the authorities suggested that the pilots mistook a road for the airport's runway in low visibility. However, the final report concluded that the primary cause of the accident was the crew's decision to descend below the approach procedure's minimum descent altitude of 530 ft without having the runway in sight. At that point, the airline's standard operating procedure would have called for an aborted landing to be immediately initiated. The report cited as contributory factors the captain's inadequate risk assessment in designating the first officer as pilot flying for the approach in the given weather conditions, and an increased pressure on the flight crew to complete the landing due to the presence of other aircraft on approach to Heho at the time. Three safety recommendations were made.

Written by Joany Kane, the film is about an aspiring interior designer who has a chance encounter with a handsome stranger, with whom she shares an impulsive romantic kiss in an elevator. Later she discovers that he is the wealthy socialite boyfriend of her callous and dominating employer. While decorating and preparing his home for an upcoming holiday charity fundraiser, they get to know each other, and soon he must decide which woman holds the key to his future happiness. Filmed on location in Richmond, Virginia, A Christmas Kiss first aired on December 11, 2011 on the Ion Television network. Plot Wendy Walton (Laura Breckenridge) is an aspiring interior designer working as an assistant to Priscilla Hall (Elisabeth R√∂hm), a prestigious but callous Boston designer. Wendy works around the clock, catering to Priscilla's every demand. Wendy's roommates are concerned that she needs to focus on her own life. One night she encounters a handsome stranger (Brendan Fehr) in an elevator and the two share an impulsive romantic kiss. After the elevator is repaired, Wendy runs off to tell her roommates about her magical encounter whose name she never learned. The next day, Wendy is summoned to Priscilla's apartment to take care of more menial tasks. There, to her shock and surprise, she meets the handsome stranger, Adam Hughes, who turns out to be Priscilla's wealthy socialite boyfriend ‚Äî and future husband if Priscilla has her way. To Wendy's disappointment, Adam does not recognize her without her glitter makeup. Adam requests that his home be decorated for an upcoming Christmas fundraiser. Later at his home, Adam shares memories of his grandmother who gave him a rare copy of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, and who left him with a love for tradition. Inspired by Adam's memories, Wendy prepares a design concept around traditional Christmas themes, including three live Christmas trees representing Christmas past, present, and future. When she shares her design sketches with Priscilla, she is ridiculed. When Adam arrives and is unimpressed with Priscilla's own plans, the scheming Priscilla shows him Wendy's sketches, claiming she prepared them herself as an alternate design. Adam loves the traditional designs and gives the go ahead. Wendy is stunned that Priscilla would take the credit, but is unable to tell Adam for fear of losing her job. In the coming days, Wendy and Adam work closely together decorating his home. Wendy realizes that she is in love with him. Despite the encouragement of her roommates, Wendy is unable to reveal the truth about the designs or her feelings to Adam. Meanwhile, Adam is having second thoughts about his marriage plans with Priscilla. Knowing they do not share the same values, he plans to return the engagement ring he bought for her. His memory of the romantic kiss in the elevator serves as a reminder of how he should feel about a woman he plans to marry. One night after completing the decorations, Wendy and Adam watch her favourite Christmas movies together and fall asleep on the couch. The next morning, Priscilla discovers them together, and later fires Wendy. Just prior to the fundraiser, Priscilla discovers the engagement ring and plants an engagement announcement in the newspaper, undermining Adam's attempt to break up the relationship. At the fundraiser party, an aloof Adam asks Priscilla about the inspiration for the design and she makes a mistake revealing to him that the designs were actually Wendy's. Meanwhile, Wendy returns to the local theatre where she once worked to help her roommates. In the audience that night, Adam and Priscilla are sitting together when Adam is beckoned backstage where he encounters Wendy. Priscilla arrives and Wendy finally confronts them both, telling them that they deserve each other because Adam did not recognize Wendy's love for him. As Priscilla prepares to rush off with Adam, Wendy's roommate arranges for a prop to bring Priscilla to a crashing halt and just in time for Adam to break off the engagement. He catches up with Wendy in an elevator, apologizes for his blindness, and admits his love for her. The two embrace and kiss, and soon after, their engagement is announced in the newspaper.

He was raised in Manglerud, Oslo and began his career as a professional musician at sixteen. He first became famous in 1981 with the song \\"Den du veit\\" and released a total of six solo albums and five albums within the band Funhouse where he was the front man. M√ºller died 14 March 1999 in a car accident in Groruddalen, Oslo. He was considered one of the foremost guitarists in Norway.  Career  M√ºller decided early on that he would play the guitar and become a guitarist. From the time he was six he heard loads of records with The Beatles together with his big brother. At nine, while vacationing at Sjusj√∏en with his family, he heard the tune \\"The Wind Cries Mary\\" by Jimi Hendrix play on the hotel jukebox. This was a crossroads for him, \\"a sensory experience that made me decide to do something with my life\\", he said later in an interview with Aftenposten. Twelve years old, he started his first band with buddies from the block in Manglerud where he grew up. Sixteen years old and straight from high school, he became a professional guitarist (later also songwriter) when he joined the French band Jackson Quintet on their world tour as they visited Northern Norway. In the next 24 years he worked tirelessly with his guitar as real companion, both as a musician, composer, record producer and radio and television host. After the tour, with the French band, he worked among others with musicians like Jahn Teigen, Alex and Olav Stedje. He also was part of the band Lava, before he suddenly became a pop star when he went solo and released his debut album Den du veit (1981). The title melody was a major plague, and was compared with the ballad Carmen (1983) for always hanging on him. Marius M√ºller was \\"Den du veit\\" (the one you know). Ten years later when interviewed by Verdens Gang, he said that not for anything in the world he would like to experience success of that kind as \\"popbamse\\" again. Then he had established himself as a guitarist of far more weight. In the late 1980s he formed Funhouse and this was his band until it split up in 1997. In Funhouse M√ºller got showcased his eminent qualities as a guitarist, and the band lived on its reputation as a potent live band on concert stages all across Norway. Parallel to Funhouse M√ºller had a solo career and gave inter alia instrumental album Seks (1995). He also worked as a studio musician, producer and composer team including film music for films Veiviseren and on the Prima Vera film Soga om Olav den Hellige. He was awarded Gammleng-prisen as a studio musician in 1985. In the spring of 1996 he was one of the hosts of the radio show Herreavdelingen on NRK P3.

In 1964, Vaughn moved his practice to the larger, adjoining town of Leakesville, where he formed a partnership for the practice of law with Thomas S. Harrington. The firm enjoyed a substantial general practice which covered several Piedmont counties in the state. Vaughn served as City Attorney for Draper from 1955 until 1967, when the towns of Draper, Leaksville, and Spray merged to form the new town of Eden, a merging Vaughn was involved in bringing about. He served as Eden town attorney until 1969, and served as prosecuting attorney for the Leaksville Recorders Court from 1959 to 1960. North Carolina House of Representatives In 1960, Vaughn was elected to represent Rockingham County in the State House of Representatives. Vaughn was involved in a number of notable projects while serving in the North Carolina House. During his first term, the 1961-63 session, Vaughn immediately had to cast hard votes to raise revenue to pay for much needed improvements to the North Carolina education system.Judge David M. Britt, Address at Presentation of Vaughn Portrait, 81 N.C. App. 704 (1987). Vaughn was also very active in getting legislation passed to extend the community college and technical institute programs in our state. He was one of the primary movers in starting Rockingham Community College, for which he served as a trustee from 1963 until 1970. In the 1965 session, Vaughn chaired the House Committee on Public Utilities, at a time during which there was a three-way fight between the private-investor companies, the Rural Electric Membership Corporation, and the cities and towns retailing electricity. He also served as the Vice Chair of the Committee on Corporations during which time the legislature was considering whether or not North Carolina should adopt the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). During the same session, he also served on the committee that took primary charge of creating legislation to establish the North Carolina District Court system, a uniform system of courts below the Superior Court level. During a special session of the General Assembly, called by Governor Dan K. Moore in the Fall of 1965, despite pressure from supporters to oppose any amendments, Vaughn voted for and supported changes to the controversial Speaker Ban law. In 1966, Vaughn was appointed to the North Carolina Courts Commission. The Commission had been created by the 1963 General Assembly to make recommendations to improve the North Carolina court system. In the Fall of 1965 a constitutional amendment had been approved authorizing the Legislature to create an intermediate Court of Appeals. As a member of the Commission, Vaughn was deeply involved in creating the report and final recommendations on creating the Court of Appeals for the General Assembly. In 1967, at the age of 39, he was designated to serve as Speaker pro tem for the 1967 session and he was unanimously selected by his Democratic colleagues to be majority leader during the 1967 session. Vaughn also accepted the chairmanship of the House committee on courts, which oversaw legislation to create the Court of Appeals. Successfully enacted, the law provided that the court would originally have six members, to be appointed by the Governor in 1967. It also provided that as of 1 July 1969 the membership of the Court would be increased to nine and authorized the Governor serving at that time to appoint the additional three members. When then- Speaker David M. Britt resigned the day before the end of the legislative session to accept an appointment to the newly created Court of Appeals, Vaughn was chosen to complete Britt‚Äôs term as Speaker. During 1967-69, Vaughn was also instrumental in laying the groundwork for the North Carolina Zoo, which was later developed in Asheboro, NC. In 1968 the voters of Rockingham County overwhelmingly elected Earl W. Vaughn to the state House of Representatives for a fifth term. This led the way for Vaughn‚Äôs unanimous selection by the membership to be elected Speaker of the NC House of Representatives for the 1969 ‚Äì 1970 session. Former Pfeiffer and UNC Law School classmate, and current state representative Samuel H. Johnson gave the nominating speech. While serving as Speaker, Vaughn oversaw negotiations and legislation concerning revenue and provision of state-provided services. As a state representative, some of Vaughn's service outside the Legislature included: :* Chairman, Council of State Governments :* Member, Committee for the Economic Development of the South :* Director, Regional Educational Laboratory of the South :* Member, North Carolina Courts Commission :* Member, North Carolina Commission on Federal and Interstate Cooperation :* Co-Chairman, Legislative Research Commission :* Director, Zoological Foundation, Inc. :* Trustee, Rockingham County Community College :* Trustee, Draper Methodist Church :* President, Rockingham County Bar Association North Carolina Court of Appeals As the 1969 session drew to a close, Vaughn resigned as Speaker to accept appointment by Governor Robert W. Scott to the North Carolina Court of Appeals. He was sworn in on July 23, 1969. Vaughn served on the Court of Appeals for fifteen and a half years. Joining the Court just two years after its creation, he played a vital part in getting the Court firmly established and accepted as an important part of the state‚Äôs judicial system. About the time he came on the Court, it began considering cases involving substantial changes in many areas of the law made by the General Assembly while Vaughn served in that body. These areas included public utilities, the Uniform Commercial Code, Rules of Civil Procedure and jurisdiction of the courts. On January 3, 1983, Vaughn was sworn in as Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, having been appointed to that position by Chief Justice Joseph Branch of the North Carolina Supreme Court. He served as chief judge for two years. During that time he devoted his best efforts to devising means of improving operating procedures of the Court. North Carolina Supreme Court Following the retirement of Justice J. William Copeland from the state Supreme Court in December 1984, Governor Jim Hunt appointed Vaughn to fill the vacancy on the Court. He was administered the oath as Associate Justice on January 2, 1985. Some three months later, Vaughn was advised that he was terminally ill with lung and brain cancer and on July 31, 1985 retired from the court. Death Although he waged a valiant fight in his battle against cancer, Vaughn died in Rex Hospital in Raleigh, North Carolina on April 1, 1986. His funeral was held in Edenton Street United Methodist Church, of which he was a member. He was buried in the Orange United Methodist Church Cemetery in Chapel Hill. Personal life On December 20, 1952, Vaughn married Eloise Freeland Maddry, a fellow student at UNC-CH whom he met in Wilson Library on campus where Eloise worked part-time as a librarian. They had four children. John Maddry Vaughn of Washington, NC, Stuart Earl Vaughn of Wilmington, NC, Rose Vaughn Williams of Raleigh, NC, and Mark Foster Vaughn. Son Mark died of AIDS in 1990 at the age of 34. Eloise has been a crusader for AIDS victims, organizing a committee known as Mothers Against Jesse in Congress (MAJIC), an initiative to defeat U.S. Senator Jesse Helms in Congress because of the stance he took in opposing those afflicted with AIDS. She later co-authored a book Keep Singing, still available in both electronic and print editions. Vaughn was active in the Methodist Church. He served as president of the Draper Rotary Club, as a member of the Tri-City Rescue Squad, as president of the Rockingham County Bar Association, and as secretary-treasurer of the county Democratic Executive Committee. During the summer of 1974 Vaughn hiked a portion of the Appalachian Trail with two of his sons, taking special measures to stop in populated areas to catch up on the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon. For about 25 years Vaughn also enjoyed deer hunting each Thanksgiving with friends at the camp of Monroe Redden Jr. in Mills River, NC near Hendersonville.

The gunmen are believed to be linked to the Islamic insurgency in the North Caucasus. He was the seventh journalist killed in the North Caucasus in ten years in connection to his work. Personal Gekkiyev was 28 years old at the time of his murder. He was born in Russia and lived in the village of Zhankhoteko in Kabardino- Balkaria, in Russia. He studied at a school. Career Gekkiyev was a popular journalist and television presenter at VGTRK in the city of Nalchik, Russia. As a journalist he reported about social issues that didn't attract much attention publicly. He took over the position of the anchor after a video was released in February from local militants alluding to the Islamic insurgency, threatening the previous two news anchors causing them to get pulled off air for safety precautions. Colleagues did not know of any motives for killing Gekkiyev in view of the fact that his reports were never connected to crime or the insurgency in the North Caucasus. Death Kazbek Gekkiyev died from three gun shot wounds to the head shot by two men with an automatic weapon late Wednesday night on 5 December 2012 around 9:00 p.m. night local time (17:00 GMT). The scene took place in a parking lot outside of his workplace as he was talking with a fellow female co-worker. Two gunmen approached the two asking Gekkiyev to confirm his identity as the television news anchor, and when he answered yes, they shot the journalist dead on the spot and fled the scene leaving his co-worker unharmed. Investigators believe Gekkiyev's death to be a threat to other journalists and their bosses not to cover news about insurgents in the region. Gekkiyev is the seventh journalist in last decade and first journalist in 2012 to be murdered in Russia in correspondence to his work. Police established the identities of Gekkiyev's attackers, one of which being Zeitun Boziev and the other unnamed, who was killed by police on 22 January. The Investigatory Committee of the Russian Federation (ICRF) established the suspect in the murder of Kazbek Gekkiev as 30-year-old Zeitun Boziev, who is also lived in Nalchick. Law enforcement started searching for Boziev in 2011 but he went to the forest after he was ordered not to leave. He then joined a group of local armed underground and eventually became the primary candidate as the replacement KBR gunman following the death of the group's leaders. Currently, Russia has a moratorium on the death penalty but soon after Gakkiyev's death and many other reporters, MP's, located in the Southern Russia, reestablished it for those guilty of killing journalists. Context Kazbek Gekkiyev was the seventh journalist killed in the North Caucus Region of Russia in ten years in connection to his work. The attack took place in the North Caucus region, a place known for terrorist attacks and threats organized by the Islamic insurgents against government functionaries, law enforcement, and moderate Muslims. The attacks conducted by the Islamic insurgents are interpreted as a message to journalists and reporters, that if you talk about the Islamic militants, you will be punished. The year 1999 was the worst for journalists with the number of journalists killed reaching 12. In 2009 Natalya Estemirova, journalist and human rights activist, was abducted in Chechnya and her body was later located with gunshot wounds. There were three known beatings and two murders in Dagestan in 2008, and with 3 journalists killed, one including Gadzhimurat Kamalov, worker of the newspaper in Chernovik who was shot and killed, Russia was ranked 6th most dangerous nation out of 40 in 2011. In 2012, Gekkiyev was the only journalist killed in 2012 taking Russia off the list of most dangerous countries for journalists. The attack specifically took place Kabardino-Balkaria, in the North Caucasus Region, which is normally viewed as a quiet republic compared to other parts of the region but has recently seen a sharp increase in militant violence due to police battling the Islamic militants. In 2005, violence in the region reached its highest point when dozens were killed at different government sites throughout Nalchik, after many simultaneous attacks planned by hundreds of militants were performed. Over 50 people have been placed before a judge, in a trial that has been in process sense 2007. One of Gekkiyevs attackers was identified as Zeitun Boziev, an Islamic militant who was killed by police in January 2013, the other remains unnamed. Boziev had a hand in the murdering of a traffic policeman on 1 June 2012, and a worker at Cherek ROVD on 29 July 2012. Islamic insurgents say their goal is to bring an Islamic state into existence in the region between the Black sea and Caspian sea. The insurgents complain of unfair treatment from authorities, police efforts to stop the violence, and tension between different ethnic groups between Balkars and Kabardians in Kabardino-Balkaria and others. Impact VGTRK, the station where Gekkiyev worked, canceled all of its entertainment and news programs following his death. Public security of Kabardino-Balkaria was raised for journalists so that they could continue their work. Political parties in the South Russian Region of Kabardino-Balkaria moved to reintroduce the death penalty for those guilty of killing reporters to replace a punishment of 12 to 20 years in prison or life in prison. At the present time, the death penalty is prohibited in Russia, which was introduced in 1996, to act in accordance with the Council of Europes regulations. Reactions Irina Bokova, director- general of UNESCO, publicly condemned the murder of Russian journalist Kazbek Gakkiyev and encouraged authorities to do their most to bring justice to his killers. She said, \\"The murder of Kazbek Gekkiyev must not go unpunished. I am encouraged by the rapid reaction of the Russian authorities, who pledged immediately that the crime would be investigated. Bringing the perpetrators to justice will send a clear sign to those who commit such acts that attempting to silence the media is not an option. The rights to freedom of expression, and the right of journalists to carry out their professional duties without fearing their lives, are fundamental conditions for everyone to live in informed and peaceful societies.\\" Dunja Mijatovic, OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media urged the authorities to put an end to the impunity by investigating of all killings of journalists. Mijatovic said, \\"Journalists in Russia are far too often subject to acts of intimidation, threats, and attacks. Sadly, some of these brave members of the media have paid the ultimate price for their fearless work.\\" President and spokesperson for Russia's Federal Investigation Committee, Vladimir Markin condemned the shooting by comment in Moscow on Thursday 6 December 2012, by saying that the killers violated the victim's \\"right to live and also the right to disseminate information. At this moment, we can say that the most probable motive was Gekkiyev's professional activity. We can view this impudent crime as a threat to other journalists speaking about the results of the struggle against the bandits underground\\". \\"Before killing Gekkiyev, the suspects made sure he was indeed a journalist, the host of a news program, which confirms the main suspected motive.\\" In an interview about Gekkiyev's murder, Alexander Cherkasov, a board member of the Memorial human rights group, said that this may indicate that these underground groups are prepared to become even more violent. \\"The new resistance leaders who are younger and have far fewer qualms as who to attack and kill for the sake of their cause must have decided to abide by fewer limits of violence as well, including violence that can now be aimed at journalists too.\\" A popular television presenter and member of the presidential Public Chamber does not agree with Cherkasov and does not believe that Gekkiyev's death was politically motivated.

The drama is set in the Louisiana bayou region. Produced by American National Films, it was also shot in Barataria Bay, Louisiana, and most of the characters are Cajun residents of a rural fishing village. Bayou features one of the few lead roles by noted character actor Timothy Carey. Plot Martin Davis, an insecure young architect, comes to New Orleans from the North to compete against a local man for the job of designing a new civic auditorium. On a visit to a carnival in the Cajun country of southern Louisiana, Martin meets Marie, a sensual Cajun girl of seventeen who works as a crabber in the bayou in order to support herself and her partly senile, alcoholic father Herbert. Marie has aroused the lustful instincts of the local storekeeper, Ulysses, a sadistic, illiterate bully who has attempted to rape her. After helping Marie to recover money stolen from her, Martin asks her to be his guide for the carnival activities. In order to impress the local building commissioner, Martin's contractor friend, Jim Tallant, enters him in a race using pirogues, primitive canoes hollowed out of tree trunks. Martin and Ulysses compete against each other and Ulysses, who greatly resents Martin's interest in Marie, wins when he deliberately cuts in front of Martin's canoe. Martin and Marie find themselves falling in love, and Martin arranges to stay longer in the area in order to court her. Ulysses then threatens to harm Marie unless Herbert gets rid of Martin. Later, at a shivaree celebrating the marriage of an old man and a young girl, Marie performs a local folk dance. Ulysses then performs a strange, gyrating dance at the conclusion of which he challenges Martin to fight for Marie, but Martin walks away. Suddenly, the wind rises and a hurricane sweeps through the area, causing much devastation. While Martin and Marie seek shelter in an unoccupied house, Martin asks Marie to marry him and she accepts. Agitated by the hurricane, Herbert goes berserk and is killed by a falling tree. At Herbert's funeral, Ulysses makes a final effort to win Marie and taunts Martin into a brutal fight. However, Martin is victorious, and he and Marie leave the bayou to begin a new life together in the North. Release and legacy The film, distributed by United Artists, did poorly upon initial release. In 1960, it was acquired by Cinema Distributors of America, who edited the film, added a few scenes, and changed the title to Poor White Trash\\"The Brooklyn Cajun: Timothy Carey in Poor White Trash,\\" by Jim Knipfel, at The Chiseler (not to be confused with a 2000 Michael Addis- directed film of the same title). The change of title was intended to make the movie seem more lurid and sleazy. The film was re-released in 1961 and met with greater commercial success, playing drive-ins for years in double features with exploitation films such as I Hate Your Guts! and Shanty Tramp.

Part of one of the major trunk lines in the country, it passes through a forested plateau region interspersed with fertile valleys. History The first train in India travelled from Mumbai to Thane on 16 April 1853. By May, 1854, Great Indian Peninsula Railway's Bombay-Thane line was extended to Kalyan. Bhusawal station was set up in 1860 and in 1867 the GIPR branch line was extended to Nagpur. The Nagpur Chhattisgarh Railway started construction of the metre gauge (soon converted to broad gauge) Nagpur-Rajnandgaon section in 1878, after surveys were started in 1871. The Nagpur-Tumsar Road section was opened in April 1880 and the Tumsar Road- Rajnandgaon section in December 1880. The Howrah‚ÄìAllahabad‚ÄìMumbai line, a joint effort of Great Indian Peninsula Railway and East Indian Railway Company came up in 1870. The Bengal Nagpur Railway was formed in 1887 for the purpose of upgrading the Nagpur Chhattisgarh Railway and then extending it via Bilaspur to Asansol, in order to develop a shorter Howrah-Mumbai route than the one via Allahabad. The Bengal Nagpur Railway main line from Nagpur to Asansol, on the Howrah-Delhi main line, was opened for goods traffic on 1 February 1891. A narrow gauge branch line was constructed from Raipur to Dhamtari, and from Abhanpur another branch line goes to Rajim. It was opened in 1900. The Gondia-Nagbhir-Nagpur line was opened for traffic in 1908. The Nagbhir-Rajoli line was opened in 1913 and extended up to Chanda. The Bhilai- Dalli Rajhara line mainly for iron ore transportation was opened in 1958. Bhilai Steel Plant was opened in 1959. The Bengal Nagpur Railway was nationalized in 1944.Eastern Railway was formed on 14 April 1952 with the portion of East Indian Railway Company east of Mughalsarai and the Bengal Nagpur Railway. In 1955, South Eastern Railway was carved out of Eastern Railway. It comprised lines mostly operated by BNR earlier. Amongst the new zones started in April 2003 were East Coast Railway and South East Central Railway. Both these railways were carved out of South Eastern Railway. Gauge conversion Work for conversion to broad gauge of the narrow gauge Gondia- Chanda Fort line started in December 1992, Gondia-Wadsa section was inaugurated on 25 September 1994. Wadsa-Nagbhir section was opened on 20 February 1997, Nagbhir-Chanda Fort section was opened on 13 January 1999 and the Chanda Fort-Ballarshah section was operated from 2 July 1999. The Gondia- Balaghat broad gauge section was opened for traffic on 6 September 2005. The Balaghat-Katangi section was converted to broad gauge in 2010. The gauge conversions are under process for long Nagpur-Chhindwara section, the long Jabalpur-Nainpur section, the long Chhindwara-Nainpur-Mandla section, the Nainpur-Balaghat section and long Nagpur-Nagbhir section. Electrification The entire main line is electrified. The Bilaspur-Bhilai and Bhilai-Durg sections were electrified in 1970-71, Durg-Paniajob section in 1989-90. The Paniajob-Gondia and Gondia-Bhandara Road sections in 1990-91, Bhandara Road- Tharsa and Tharsa-Nagpur sections in 1991-92. The Amla-Chhindwara section was electrified in 2017https://twitter.com/central_railway/status/937269672046575616?lang=en and Balharshah-Chanda Fort-Gondia section was electrified in 2018. Other lines will be electrified once converted to broad gauge. Speed limits The entire Howrah-Nagpur-Mumbai line is classified as a \\"Group A\\" line which can take speeds up to 160 km/hr. Passenger movement Bilaspur, Raipur, Durg and Nagpur on this line are amongst the top hundred booking stations of Indian Railway. About 1 to 1.2 million passengers travel from here.

He went missing from the northern Indian tourist attraction of Rishikesh, sparking an international campaign to locate him, which included his local TD, Eoghan Murphy, raising the issue in the Irish Parliament. It is believed by several analysts that he may have joined a cloistered and extreme Hindu religious cult. Others speculate that Spollen died in 2012, either as a result of drowning in the River Ganges , or after having been attacked by a wild animal. Biography Spollen has worked on stories including the Iranian nuclear programme, the Hijab controversy in Ireland and the 2009 Iranian Elections. He read Philosophy and Politics at University College Dublin, before commencing postgraduate studies in 2004 focusing on the Near and Middle East at London's School of Oriental and African Studies. Disappearance and aftermath Some commentators have speculated that Spollen may have fallen prey to a supposed condition increasingly described as the India syndrome, which shares similarities with the alleged form of spiritual hysteria known as the Jerusalem syndrome. Carney, for example, states that Spollen: \\"fits the profile of the fervent young enthusiast of yoga, meditation, and Eastern thought who becomes lost‚Äîor worse‚Äîon a journey of spiritual self-discovery.\\" However, this claim has yet to be substantiated. One post-colonial writer has expressed scepticism about the existence of a so-called India Syndrome, arguing that it is based on Orientalist notions which present an essentialised image of a spiritual India that is neither coherent nor empirically verifiable. The author, David Hammerbeck, further questions whether Spollen - if indeed having joined a reclusive religious movement - should be seen as a 'victim' of a 'crime' carried out by India, suggesting that Carney's understanding participates in Orientalism: \\"Though citing relatively few examples, the author‚Äôs message is simple and clear: India forms not just a political and cultural entity, but also a spiritual and psychological state of being that is inherently dangerous to Westerners.\\" Placing this within the history of negative perceptions of non-Western cultures said to be characteristic of much Western analysis as contended by Edward Said, Hammmerbeck further states: \\"This point of view parallels Said and other critics‚Äô rather orthodox Orientalism, a clear thesis/antithesis between home and foreign cultures with no possible synthesis. The foreign other, in this case the guru as embodiment of Hindu mysticism, functions as a negative of Western values, consistent with the approach that Said and others propose as being the historical epistemology of Orientalism.\\" On the fifth anniversary of his disappearance, the BBC News website published a major feature on Spollen, written by his former colleague and now BBC journalist Roland Hughes. Spollen is still considered a missing person. Indian police and Irish authorities are calling for any information as to his whereabouts, with the former also reportedly investigating Spollen for breaching Indian visa regulations , in the event that he has remained in the country. Overstaying a visa carries a maximum penalty under The Foreigners Act, 1946 of five years imprisonment with a fine and subsequent deportation from India.

The single coincided with the UK release of the album that year (Yes You Can had been released in Europe in 1992). It was the second single to be released from the album, following \\"Irresistible\\" as a European single in 1992. \\"Star for a Week (Dino)\\" was written by Harley, and produced by Harley and Matt Butler. Background \\"Star for a Week\\" was first performed live at Harley's sold out Hammersmith Odeon concert in October 1979. For many years after, the song was regularly performed live, which established the song as a fan favourite. After signing to RAK Records in 1984, a studio recording of the song was to be included on Harley's 1986 solo album El Gran Senor, however the album was shelved after the label went bankrupt in 1986. A few years later, the song was re-recorded for the Yes You Can album. Like much of the album, it was recorded and remixed at the White House Studios in Bures, Suffolk. After Yes You Can was released in Europe in 1992, Harley struck a deal with Food for Thought Records, who gave the album a UK release in 1993. \\"Star for a Week (Dino)\\" was issued as a promotional single in attempt to gain radio-play and promote the album. Inspiration The song's lyrics are based on the true story of Orestes Babouris, a 17-year-old of Brandon, Suffolk, who was also known as Dino. In the period of a week, Babouris carried out a number of armed robberies and stole several cars. Initially he and another 17-year-old, Andrew Ross, stole ¬£700 from a man using imitations guns. They booked themselves into the Golden Galleon Motel at Oulton Broad to lie low, and fired at two policemen when they arrived to question the youths on 16 August. Dino's mother, Mrs. Pearl Babouris, pleaded to her son on television and radio to hand himself in, and the \\"most wanted teenager in Britain\\" continued to evade capture until 23 August when he was stopped at a roadblock at Thrapston and taken to Huntingdon Police Station. Babouris was given a six-year sentence, whereas Ross, who was captured at an earlier date, was given a four-year sentence. Intrigued by the story, Harley wrote \\"Star for a Week\\" using many lines that he heard through TV news coverage of the two outlaws, and quotes from Dino's mother in particular. The line featuring \\"the man with no name\\" referenced the Clint Eastwood character of the same name, which a victimised postmistress had used to describe Dino. Harley felt the story had a little bit of \\"Billy the Kid\\" about it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XVzpfMckEM In a live performance of the song at Brighton in 1989, Harley revealed: Speaking of the song's story at a 2011 concert in Athens, Greece, Harley commented further: Release \\"Star for a Week (Dino)\\" was released by Food for Thought Records on CD in the UK only. The B-Side, \\"The Lighthouse\\", was written by Harley and was taken from Yes You Can. The single had no artwork and was issued in a clear plastic sleeve. Following its original release, the song has appeared on three compilations; 1998's More Than Somewhat ‚Äì The Very Best of Steve Harley, 2000's Best of the 70's and 2006's The Cockney Rebel ‚Äì A Steve Harley Anthology. Live versions of the song have also been recorded and released. The song was performed at Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel's 1984 concert at the Camden Palace, London, which was filmed for TV and released on the VHS Live from London in 1985.. In 1989, the band's Brighton concert included the song and was released on the VHS The Come Back, All is Forgiven Tour: Live. Another version appears on the 1995 album Live at the BBC, which Harley recorded during a session for Nicky Campbell in 1992, and another was included on the 1999 album Stripped to the Bare Bones. Track listing ;CD Single #\\"Star for a Week (Dino)\\" - 4:33 #\\"The Lighthouse\\" - 5:58 Critical reception Anthony Seymour of The Journal wrote: \\"Harley's new single, \\"Star for a Week\\", sounds promising. Let's hope it gets some air time.\\" In a review of Yes You Can, Dave Thompson of AllMusic said of the song and its B-Side: \\"It's a sad state of affairs, but the best of Yes You Can, Steve Harley's first new album in a decade, was never going to make it onto a studio recording. Rather, it resides in the live environment where the songs almost unanimously came to life, a fact which Harley himself seemed to acknowledge with the release, just six months later, of Live in the UK. There, both \\"Star for a Week (Dino)\\" and \\"The Lighthouse\\" emerge with vibrant electricity, as emotionally charged as any old favorites, as deliciously delivered as they deserved. In the studio, however, though the quality remains, the emotion pales, and Harley's energies - hitherto rejuvenated after so long in abeyance - flag accordingly.\\" Thompson also spoke of the song in a review of the Make Me Smile - Live on Tour album from 1996: \\"The highlights, then, are the same as last time - two cuts from Harley's Yes You Can album, \\"The Lighthouse\\" and \\"Star for a Week,\\" work far more effectively live than they did in the studio.\\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/make-me-smile-mw0000587337 In a review of Harley's 1998 concert at Sheffield, Peter Kane of Q stated: \\"To make sure this particular evening goes with a swing, it certainly helps that the audience could have handpicked that very afternoon from the streets of Sheffield.

Elsa Nyholm was born at a farm a in Nordan√• in rural Scania, southernmost Sweden. Despite a strong interest in natural history, she was not allowed to attend grammar school. Instead, she went to handicraft and household schools and developed her interest in nature on the side. In 1932, she got a job as museum assistant at the Lund University botanical museum. There, she specialized in bryology and conceived the idea of a grand moss flora of Northern Europe. Although lacking a formal academic degree, she found support at the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm and received research council grants from 1954 to 1964 to undertake the work. From 1964 to her retirement, she was the head curator of the moss herbarium at the Swedish Museum of Natural History. Elsa Nyholm's name is particularly associated with her two grand moss floras, the Illustrated Moss Flora of Fennoscandia and Illustrated Flora of Nordic Mosses.

Replacing b with -b^{-1} gives another equivalent form of the identity: :(a+ab^{-1}a)^{-1} + (a+b)^{-1} =a^{-1}. An important application of the identity is a proof of Hua's theorem. The theorem says that if \\\\sigma: K \\\\to L is a function between division rings and if \\\\sigma satisfies: :\\\\sigma(a + b) = \\\\sigma(a) + \\\\sigma(b), \\\\quad \\\\sigma(1) = 1, \\\\quad \\\\sigma(a^{-1}) = \\\\sigma(a)^{-1}, then \\\\sigma is either a homomorphism or an antihomomorphism.

F.L.S. (1815‚Äì1904) was an English surgeon and member of the Linnean Society of London who was an early specialist on breast disease, including breast cancer, and an early advocate of histology. He published a book on breast disease in the mid-nineteenth century. Birkett was born near London in 1815. He was an apprentice to Bransby Cooper, a nephew of Astley Cooper, and like him a surgeon at Guy's Hospital. He became assistant surgeon in 1849 and took Bransby Cooper's position after the latter retired, in 1853. An early advocate of histology, he introduced the teaching thereof in 1845, and subsequently promoted the use of histopathology in cancer diagnosis.  Eponyms  Medical instruments and disorders that are named after Birkett are the Birkett forceps, the Birkett haemostatic forceps, and Birkett hernia. The Birkett hernia is also known as an ascending hernia or intermusculuar hernia, and is the type of inguinal hernia where the sac extends into the anterior or inferior wall.  The Diseases of the Breast and Their Treatment  Birkett's most memorable contribution to his field was his treatise on diseases on the mammary gland, the very first comprehensive treatment of the subject, for which he was awarded the Jacksonian Prize by The Royal College of Surgeons of England in 1848. The dissertation was published as a book entitled The Diseases of the Breast and Their Treatment in 1850. It was 258 pages long, with 12 plates. Birkett's work fell into obscurity for 150 years, and both it and he himself (in the context of breast disease at least) were largely forgotten by medical historians. He receives no mention, for example, in the Biographical History of Guy's Hospital . His book was overshadowed by a book published by Alfred Velpeau some four years later, and even contemporary reviewers were initially unsure that Birkett's work provided much beyond that of Astley Cooper. One reviewer, writing in the Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal in 1850, said that \\"[t]he diseases of the breast have been so fully described by Sir Astley Cooper, that we took up Mr. Birkett's essay without much hope of further information, but on perusal we found much additional matter\\". Velpeau was aware of Birkett's book, a fact apparent from his quoting it several times in his own, and it is likely that it was Birkett's publication that spurred Velpeau finally to publication after 30 years. Described by the PMSJ reviewer as \\"the most complete monograph in the English language\\" on the subject, the book contained drawings, some coloured, in stone and zinc, observations by other doctors on carcinomae, Birkett's own observations, and a table of causes of death by mammarian cancer of 37 patients in Guy's Hospital. It was the first treatment of the subject to focus primarily on benign conditions rather than on cancerous ones, devoting 215 pages to the former and only 42 to the latter. This can be contrasted with the 88 preceding publications that Birkett quoted, almost all of which were primarily devoted to cancer. Birkett's approach to the subject compares favourably with the approaches both of Velpeau and of other contemporary works. Birkett divided up the subject simply and logically, into: # Diseases before puberty # Diseases during the establishment of puberty # Diseases after the establishment of puberty ## During pregnancy, puerperium and lactation ## At any period or age after puberty He gave a clinical description of each condition, and related it to both anatomy and physiology. His descriptions of management of the various conditions are outmoded in the 21st century. But his descriptions and illustrations of the conditions are still useful today. In plates vii and viii, for examples, one can find seven well-executed microscopic illustrations of two cases of lobular carcinomae. The book also contains descriptions of a typical mammary fistula; treatment of the same by seton stitch; breast cysts; and mastalgia and galactorrhea. Mansel, Sweetland, and Hughes describe the macroscopic and microscopic illustrations of duct ectasia and fibroadenoma in the plates as \\"ahead of their time\\", also observing that the descriptions of duct ectasia pre-date the work of Joseph Colt Bloodgood by half a century.  Life and career   Hospital and teaching career  Birkett was tutored on a wide range of subjects in several British public schools, it being recorded that one of his schoolmasters was a Frenchman, one a Greek scholar, and one a mathematician and astronomer. In September 1831, at age 16, he was made the apprentice of Bransby Blake Cooper, who was a surgeon at Guy's Hospital at the time. He was one of the last people, possibly indeed the last person, to pay the ¬£500 fee for such apprenticeship, which was the customary fee for ensuring that the apprentice received higher priority consideration by the master when a vacancy for a surgeon at the hospital opened up. He began his medical studies in October of the following year. Birkett was admitted a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons on 1837-10-06, and appointed a Demonstrator of Anatomy at the same time, a post that he held until 1847. In 1844 he was elected Fellow of the R.C.S. without examination, and by 1845/1846 he was giving demonstrations in microscopic anatomy on weekday evenings, the first instruction in histology given at the medical school. In 1847 he was appointed to the position of making the hospital's post-mortem examinations. In May 1849 he was elected assistant surgeon. after the promotion of Edward Cock and the death of John Morgan. In 1851 he gave joint lectures with John Hilton on anatomy. And in 1853 he succeeded Cooper as a surgeon upon Cooper's retirement. He remained surgeon, lecturing on surgery with John Poland, until he himself retired in 1875, at the age of 60.  Royal College of Surgeons and other professional societies  Birkett was a member of the Council of the R.C.S. from 1867 to 1883, and Hunterian Professor of Surgery and Pathology from 1869 to 1871. He moved up through the R.C.S. ranks. He was Examiner in Anatomy and Physiology from 1875 to 1877, member of the Court of Examiners from 1872 to 1882, member of the Examining Board for Dental Surgery from 1875 to 1882, Vice-President (1875‚Äì1876), and finally President in 1877. Elsewhere, Birkett was also one of the founders of the Pathological Society of London, where he was Vice- President from 1860 to 1862. In 1871 and 1892 he was Master of the Worshipful Company of Ironmongers, and he was also Inspector for the Home Office of the Anatomical schools of Anatomy in the Provinces.  Family and personal life  The only child of John and Mary Birkett, Birkett was born on 1815-04-15 at 10, The Terrace, Upper Clapton, Middlesex, England. From 1840 to 1848, he lived at 2 Broad Street Buildings. Making a bid for a practice he then moved to Wellington Street, Southwark. In 1856, he moved again to Green Street, Grosvenor Square. Upon retirement from active life, he finally moved to Sussex Gardens, where he died on 1904-07-06, after a stroke, aged 90. He married Lucy Matilda, daughter of Halsey Jansen, in 1842, and out of a family of seven sons and three daughters, he was survived by four sons and one daughter. Two of those sons were to become distinguished rugby football players, Reg and Louis.

They settled the Ebro valley, specifically in the area along the Pyrenees. Its capital was Iaca (now Jaca). According to Strabo, their land stretched from the Pyrenees to Lleida and Huesca. It is believed that they could be related to the Aquitanes. They were known to stamp coins. They also appear in the texts of Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy. Their affiliation with the Vascones is disputable, as they inhabited an area in the high Aragon river valley (today's northwestern corner of Aragon). Strabo mentions Iacetani in his Sertorius chronicles as people independent from the Vascones, although another Greek historian, Ptolemy identified them with the Vascones. According to some theories, they may have originated from the Aquitanians who crossed the Pyrenees and settled in the southern slopes of the mountains along with the Vascones (they could be related peoples or tribes with a common origin but not the same people). These mountain people were bordered to the south by the Suessetani of the plains, who were often looted by the inhabitants of Iaca. Iacetani were defeated by the Romans in 195 BC when Cato the Elder took their capital with the support of Suessetani, which distracted the Iacetanian army. Starting from this event in the early 2nd century BC, the Iacetani no longer appear in classical sources, although they continue minting coins with the inscription \\"IACA\\", which is coincident with their being mentioned by Strabo, dating between the 1st century BC and early in the 1st century AD. There accounts, however, that Julius Caesar interacted with the tribe and this was documented in his writings, citing the Iacetani as one of the tribes that changed allegiances to him alongside the Ausetani and Illurgavoness during his campaign extending the Roman frontier. This event happened shortly after Decimus Brutus defeated Domitius' fleet in the war against the Veneti and increased Caesar's reputation among the natives prompting the Iacetani to begin sending envoys and even agreed to supply him with corn. In the year 19 their territory was incorporated into the Roman Empire, after the Cantabrian Wars, as vassals of Rome. This meant that they did not enjoy the citizenship status, and their situation was precarious compared to other peoples of the region, such as the Sedetani.  References  * VV.

The band consists of Munz (Vocals), Varun Raj (Guitar), Nezer Ahemed (Bass Guitar, Backing Vocals), Sushin Shyam (Keyboards, Backing Vocals), Ganesh Radhakrishnan (Drums), and Advaith Mohan (Guitar). The band released its debut album titled How Are You? We Are Fine, Thank You on 1 January 2014 to rave reviews. It was produced by Keshav Dhar (Skyharbor) at Illusion Audio, New Delhi.  History  Band formation The band started off as a two-man studio project by Varun and Munz in 2008, called Ultimatyum. After roping in Sushin (who had collaborated with Varun on a previous project called 25 Aug), Prayag (drums), Rinoy Balan (guitars), and Shaib (bass), The Down Troddence as a full-fledged band became a reality. Due to the departure of Shaib due to personal reasons, Nezer came in to take over bass duties. Following the release of their first single \\"Death Vanity\\", Prayag was replaced by Ganesh (previously with Progressive Metal band Purple Blood) on drums. The band got its first big boost with the release of the music video for their single \\"Shiva\\". The video received the Best Music Video award at the IndieGo South Asian Music Awards. Following a series of victories at college fests in and around South India, the band went on a short hiatus during which time the various band members shifted base to other cities. Munz, Nezer and Ganesh shifted to Bangalore, while Sushin moved to Chennai to work as the studio programmer for famed South Indian music director Deepak Dev. At this juncture, Rinoy also departed the band and was replaced by Advaith Mohan (of Chennai-based band Iterate), who is also based in Bangalore. Debut album The band had already released three singles independently before 2012, and wanted to work on a full-fledged debut album. By mid October 2012, pre-production work on nine tracks had been completed, and Keshav Dhar of Skyharbor fame, agreed to produce the album. Tracking was done in Bangalore during November. After a long wait of almost a year, the debut album titled How Are You? We Are Fine, Thank You. was released at Counterculture, Bangalore on New Year's Eve, 2014. The digital version of the album has gone on to become the top-seller on Oklisten.com in the span of 5 days.

The band also incorporates a lot of traditional folk sounds and instruments in the form of ambient layers in their music. Rhythm structures used in their songs too are primarily inspired by folk music. Lyrically the band has a strong philosophy of talking about inequalities and injustices which are ever present in India's social and political systems. A common theme in their music is the effort to project the voice of the under-privileged and down-trodden people. Another big influence on the band has been the Malayalam Folk Rock band Avial, who also speak about similar themes in their music.

Historically the grape was believed to be responsible for the Ancient Roman wine Caecubum that was praised by writers such as Pliny the Elder and Horace but historians and wine experts such as Jancis Robinson and Julia Harding note that connection is likely erroneous.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 3, 196 and 940, Allen Lane 2012 The grape is primarily used as a blending variety where it often contributes body, phenolics and high alcohol levels. As of 2000, there were 717 hectares (1,772 acres) of the grape planted in Italy. Some ampelographers suspect that the Lazio grape variety San Giuseppe nero may be related to (or possibly a clone) of Abbuoto but so far DNA analysis has not yet confirmed such suspicions. Origins Piedirosso, one of the grapes believed to be a parent of Abbuoto. DNA profiling has not definitively revealed Abbuoto's origin though the grape is almost definitely indigenous to central Italy. A 2010 study from an Italian research team suggested that Abbuoto is a crossing of the Campanian red grape varieties Piedirosso and Casavecchia, however addition results from the same 2010 research also posited that the relationship between Abbuoto and Casavecchia may actually be reversed with Casavecchia being a cross of Abbuto and Malvasia Bianca di Candia. Caecuban wine (Latin: Caecubum, Greek: Kaikoubos, Italian: C√®cubo) was produced on a small vineyard in the low lying marshy region, south of Terracina (today's southern Lazio and northern Campania). The synonym C√®cubo derived from the belief that Abbuoto was the variety used to provide the famous Caecuban wine mentioned in the odes of Horace and Pliny the Elder. However Caecuban was a white wine, which following a standard Roman practice was aged for a number of years, during which it changed gaining a color of the \\"flames\\". The vintage was destroyed in the middle of the 1st century and Caecuban never recovered, however the name became a generic term for wine with the characteristic color of the true wine. Small quantities of undistinguished red wine called C√®cubo are produced in the district today. An Italian wine expert and connoisseur Mimmo Albano tells a story that in some of the marshy areas around Lake Fondi about 50 miles south of Rome, there were some old, neglected vines of a type that was thought to be the ancient Abbuoto. Cuttings were taken from these vines and nursed back to health. The healthy vines were definitely different from any other variety currently known, and the claim that they are the same as the ancient Abbuoto has remained unchallenged. Viticulture The Abbuoto vine tends to produces large dark colored berries with thick skins. The grape tends to ripens in the middle of the harvest season (early to mid October depending on the vintage year) but can be prone to producing irregular and inconsistent yields. Wine regions Abbuoto is planted throughout the Lazio region, including around the commune of Fondi (pictured). Abbuoto is found primarily in the Lazio region of central Italy where it associated with the villages of Fiuggi, Fondi, Formia, Monte San Biagio and Terracina. There is also some plantings in Campania around Sessa Aurunca where the grape is often blended with Piedirosso and Primitivo. As of 2000, there were 717 ha (1,772 acres) of the variety planted throughout Italy. DOC wines Abbuoto is a permitted grape variety in several Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) regions including the Aprilia DOC where the grape can be produced as a varietal wine provided that the wine is composed of at least 95% of the grape. In the Atina DOC, up to 15% Abbuoto with other local red grape varieties can be blended in the DOC red wine along with Cabernet Sauvignon (50-70% of the blend), Syrah (10-30%), Merlot (10-30%) and Cabernet franc (10-30%). Abbuoto grapes destined for DOC wine producing in Atina must harvested to a yield no greater than 12 tonnes/ha with the finished wine attaining a minimum alcohol level of at least 12%. A separate Riserva bottling can also be produced provided the wine attains a minimum alcohol level of at least 12.5% and is aged at least two years prior to release.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pp. 121-205 Firefly Books 2004 In the Castelli Romani DOC, up to 15% Abbuoto with other local red grape varieties can be blended in the DOC red wine along with Cesanese Comune, Sangiovese, Montepulciano, Nero Buono and Merlot. For the DOC red wines, the grapes must be harvested toa maximum yield no greater than 12 tonnes/ha with the finished wine needing to attain a minimum alcohol levels of at least 11%. In the Genazzano DOC, up to 20% Abbuoto with other local red grape varieties can be blended in the DOC red wine along with Sangiovese (70-90% of the blend) and Cesanese (10-30%). Here on the southern slopes of Monti Prenestini south of Rome, the grapes are harvested up to a maximum yield of 14 tonnes/ha with the finished wine attaining a minimum alcohol level of at least 11%. In the large Tarquinia DOC that expands across the Viterbo and Rome province, up to 30% Abbuoto with other local red grape varieties can be blended in the DOC red wine along with Sangiovese and/or Montepulciano which either separate or together must account for at least 60% of the blend and Cesanese which makes up to 25% of the blend. Grapes are limited to a maximum yield of 12 tonnes/ha with the finished wine needing to attain a minimum alcohol level of 10.5%. A novello wine can also be produced with the same blending requirements and a minimum alcohol level of at least 11%.

Most mines are simply closed once they are no longer productive. For safety they are usually partially destroyed (filled in). However, many mines are at least partially accessible today to visitors. In such cases they may be referred to as show mines or visitor mines if the focus is mainly on visiting the former mine, or mining museums if the mine only forms part of a museum. Most show mines have been set up in abandoned mines. In recent decades, however, they are often established immediately after mining ceases, creating some jobs funded at least partially by cultural tourism. Overview Fireman practising the rescue of an injured group of visitors in the Fell Visitor Mine A show mine is often just a small part of a much larger mining facility that is developed, secured and provided with educational exhibits and installations. Such mines are usually equipped with fixed electrical lighting, which rarely existed in earlier mining operations. A few mines offer more authentic guided tours, by not using electric lights and equipping visitors instead with miners' lamps. In Germany and Austria, the respective mining offices are entrusted with the supervision of the show mines within their areas of responsibility. This specifically includes the observance of safety. For example, show mines must have a second exit and the fire service responsible must agree to practise the rescue of accident victims from the mine at regular intervals. Preserved pit railways, needed to reach mining works deep within a mountain, are especially popular. A few visitor mines still have working winders that transport visitors down into the mine. They are also an important element of the mining industry, without which a portrayal of the technology would be incomplete. In addition, the ride for young and old is an experience that often represents an additional highlight of their visit. There are show mines in many nations around the world, but they are of course particularly common in industrialized nations. The longer a country's mining history, the more interesting are its abandoned mines. In Germany there are more than 100 such show mines, but many may only be visited on Sundays or by appointment. In Austria there are just over 30 visitor mines. Some of these mines have been closed in recent years, because they no longer meet significantly higher safety standards introduced after the Lassing mining disaster. Examples include the Arthur Gallery (Arthurstollen) and the shale oil mine in Pertisau. Many show mines have only been established for the purpose of demonstration, without ever having served for extraction of mineral resources. These include the Mining Museum in Bochum, the Barbara Gallery at the University of Cologne and the so-called German Slate Mine in Mayen.

Signs and symptoms The clinical findings in this disease can be divided into acute and end-stage manifestations: In the acute phase, patients often present with decreased visual acuity, vitritis, papillitis, and crops of gray-white or yellow-white outer retinal lesions. The clustering of the retinal lesions is important because this often helps to localize the causative nematode. If left untreated, patients ultimately develop late sequel, which may include optic atrophy, retinal arterial narrowing, diffuse retinal pigment epithelial changes, and an abnormal electroretinogram. The late findings of this condition are often misinterpreted as unilateral retinitis pigmentosa. Cause DUSN may be caused by a helminthic infection with Toxocara canis, Baylisascaris procyonis, or Ancylostoma caninum. The characteristic lesions are believed to result from a single nematode migrating within the subretinal space. Although previously thought to be endemic in some areas, that belief was likely due to under awareness. DUSN has been diagnosed in patients in many countries and climates including America, Brazil, China and India. Diagnosis Treatment If the nematode can be seen by an ophthalmologist, which occurs in less than half of cases, it should be treated with photocoagulation for extramacular location and surgical removal in case the larva is lying in the macula. After the worm is killed, visual acuity loss usually does not progress. Alternatively, Antihelminthic treatment such as high dose oral Albendazole and prednisolone may be used. Laser photocoagulation is the treatment of choice in cases of DUSN where the worm is seen clinically or to the outer retinal crops as the worm might be in the vicinity of these lesions.[1] The worm is identifiable in only 30% of the cases. This case may be an early stage of the disease since no optic atrophy or vascular attenuation was present. We used a PSLP for the treatment of the worm instead of a conventional laser as multiple spots of laser in a grid pattern can be administered within a faster time frame. The speed of performing the laser is important as to avoid the migration of the worm to the fovea. In case of a large worm, the first step could be targeting the ends of the worm since laser to the head end would immobilize the worm and prevent its migration.[2] References [1] Relhan N, Pathengay A, Raval V, Nayak S, Choudhury H, Flynn HW Jr. Clinical experience in treatment of diffuse unilateral subretinal neuroretinitis.

Unlike the nadaswaram, the ottu has no fingerholes, being intended to produce one constant note while playing. It is provided with several small tuning holes which can be stopped with wax to modify its note. In some cases, a shruti box may be used in place of the ottu due to its steadier sound.

Davis did not seek a ninth term in the state House in the primary election held on March 4, 2014. Background Davis received two degrees, a Bachelor of Science from the University of Houston and in 1987 a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Houston‚ÄìClear Lake. He also holds a third degree, a Bachelor of Business Administration, which he obtained in 1982 from the Southern Baptist-affiliated Baylor University in Waco. Davis is affiliated with Rotary International and the Salvation Army in Pasadena, Texas, and the Chamber of Commerce in the Clear Lake Area. He is a member of the University Baptist Church in Houston. In 1984, Davis, a fifth generation Texan, married the former Jayne Anne Reed. He has three sons, Reagan, Samuel, and Gaston Davis. Political life After five terms in the District 129 House seat, Republican Mike Jackson, a native of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, who was elected in 1998 to the Texas Senate, District 11 seat in the Texas State Senate to succeed Jerry E. Patterson. Davis ran in the Republican primary for the position and with 39.6 percent of the vote was placed into a runoff election, which he won with 62 percent of the ballots cast. Davis then won the general election with 70.6 percent of the vote. Since 1998, he has had easy reelection contests, with his closest races having come in 2006 and 2008, when he still exceeded 57 percent of the ballots cast in both contests. Davis in his last regular session chaired the House Economic and Small Business Development Committee and sat as well on the Public Education Committee. Davis was the vice chairman of the former Texas House Select Committee on Hurricane Ike Devastation. He also once served on the Medicaid Reform Legislative Oversight Committee. He is a past recipient of the \\"Legislative Excellence Award\\" from the Brain Injury Association of Texas and the Award for Public Service by the Texas Osteopathic Medical Association. Briscoe Cain, Sheryl Berg, Mary Huls, Jeff Larson, Chuck Maricle, Dennis Paul, and Brent Perry competed for the Republican nomination to succeed Davis. Sheryl Berg led the field on March 4, 2014 with 2,806 votes (25.6 percent), 50 votes more than her runner-up, Dennis Paul, who polled 2,756 votes (25.1 percent). The two will meet in a runoff election on May 27. Brent Perry finished third with 1,869 votes (17 percent). Paul defeated Berg for the Republican House nomination and then won the seat in the general election. Legislative voting records Representative Davis in 2013 supported the ban on abortion after twenty weeks of gestation; the measure passed the House, 96-49. He voted for companion legislation to increase medical and licensing requirements of abortion providers, a move which opponents said could lead to the closure of many abortion clinics in the state. These issues brought forth an unsuccessful filibuster in the state Senate by Wendy R. Davis of Fort Worth, who in 2014 is the Democratic nominee for governor against the Republican Greg Abbott. In 2011, Representative Davis supported two other anti-abortion measures. One forbids state funding of agencies which perform abortions. The other requires that a woman undergo a sonogram before procuring an abortion. This legislation is based on the view that a woman could change her mind about an abortion once she witnesses the development of the unborn child through the latest technology. Despite his votes on those four issues, the Texas Right to Life Committee, according to Project Vote Smart, rated Davis 30 percent favorable in 2013 and 56 percent in 2011 but 102 percent in 2003. The National Abortion Rights Action League rated him 20 percent in 2005. Davis sponsored the establishment of the taxpayer- funded school breakfast program. He co-sponsored legislation to provide marshals for school security as a separate law-enforcement entity. He also co- sponsored the successful bill to extend the franchise tax exemption to certain businesses. Davis voted for the adoption of the biennial state budgets in both 2013 and 2011 budget. He voted to require testing for narcotics of those individuals receiving unemployment compensation. Davis supported the bill to prohibit the state government from engaging in the enforcement of federal regulations of firearms. He co-sponsored the bill to allow college and university officials to carry concealed weapons in buildings and vehicles in the name of campus security. He supported the bill to reduce the time required to obtain a concealed-carry permit. He backed the redistricting bills for the state House and Senate and the United States House of Representatives. He voted against term limits for certain state officials. In 2011, Davis voted to permit texting while driving, but he reversed course in 2013 and voted to prohibit the practice. Davis voted in 2013 against an \\"equal pay for women\\" bill, which passed the Legislature but was vetoedoed by Governor Rick Perry. In 2011, Davis supported a resolution to reduce funding for state agencies. He voted to expand the sales tax to Internet transactions to match existing laws for brick and mortar stores; the measure passed the House 125-20. Davis voted against a bill to prohibit smoking in public places. He voted to establish eligibility for indigent health care. He voted for corporal punishment in public schools; the bill nevertheless passed the House, 80-64. Davis voted to require colleges and universities to make student centers compatible with traditional family values. To guarantee the integrity of the election process, Davis supported picture identification of voters. The law finally took effect in October 2013 and was used widely without incident in the primaries on March 4, 2014. In 2013, Davis supported related legislation to forbid a voter from turning in multiple ballots. Interest group ratings Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum, managed in Texas by Cathie Adams, a former state chairman of the Texas Republican Party, rated Davis 58 percent favorable in 2013, 32 percent in 2011, 64 percent in 2009, and 84 percent in 2007. The Young Conservatives of Texas gave him a cumulative score of 75 percent but only 40 percent in 2013. The interest group Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, founded by Michael Quinn Sullivan, rated Davis 30 percent favorable in 2013 and 0 percent in 2011, low rankings for a Republican lawmaker. The Texas Association of Business, however, awarded him a cumulative career score of 87 percent. The Texas League of Conservation Voters rated him 86 percent in 2013; the Sierra Club, 60 percent in 2011.

Virtually all that is known of its existence comes from a single letter published in the Sacramento Union of March 28, 1864. The letter promotes mining activity in the area and states that the town was laid out by Lieutenant W.A. Oliver and surveyed by L.F. Cooper. Several buildings had been erected and others were under construction when the letter was written.  History  The history of WMC provides a good example of how even primary historical sources can be misleading. The author of the Sacramento Union letter (‚ÄúD.Q.C.‚Äù) asserted that that he visited WMC due to a desire to visit the famous ‚ÄúDeep Spring precinct where the heavy vote was recorded for Judge Quint two years and a half ago which gave rise to the famous contested election case‚Ä¶‚Äù The first modern historian to write about the contested election, W.A. Chalfant, took D.Q.C‚Äôs letter at face value and concluded that WMC was: 1) the site of the voter fraud which led to the contested election; and 2) must have existed as early as 1861, when the fraud occurred. However, a close reading of the testimony given to the legislature in the contested election makes it clear that neither conclusion is correct. The fraudulent ballots were those of the ‚ÄúBig Springs precinct,‚Äù not ‚ÄúDeep Spring precinct‚Äù and the ‚ÄúBig Springs precinct,‚Äù had it existed, was at a mining camp at the headwaters of Cottonwood Creek, not White Mountain City. Over 36 people -- largely prospectors and outfitters -- gave evidence to the investigating elections committees of the legislature and not a single one mentioned White Mountain City.

His bride was Julia Davis, daughter of portrait photographer Hyman Davis, and later to become well known in her own right as author Frank Danby. They lived first at 103 Gloucester Terrace (London W), where their eldest son Gilbert Frankau was born in 1884,Gilbert Frankau, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography before moving to 32a Weymouth Street in the later 1880s. There, their two younger sons, Paul (known as Jack) and Ronald Frankau, were born in 1890 and 1894 respectively, as was their daughter Aline (1896‚Äì1986), known as Joan. American costume designer Aline Bernstein recalled staying at Arthur and Julia Frankau's house when her father, the New York actor Joseph Frankau (who was Frankau's first cousin) was performing in London: \\"It was a perfect Georgian house, everything in it had beauty and order; the design of the furniture, the chintz, the arrangement of flowers, the way food was passed at table, and the tea service. It was brilliantly clean, the silver and old woods looked as though they not only had just been polished, but had been polished for hundreds of years.\\"Aline Bernstein, An Actor's Daughter, A. A. Knopf 1941, Ch. 7 She also remembered that Arthur and Julia's children \\"all lived upstairs like a separate little family, almost like a lot of little lepers, it seemed to me.\\" In 1903, the death of Edwin Frankau and the success of Frank Danby's latest novel, Pigs in Clover, provided Arthur and Julia Frankau with the means to move house once more, to 11 Clarges Street (Mayfair), and to acquire a holiday home on the Sussex coast named Clover Cottage (now No. 13 South Cliff, Eastbourne). \\"But my father had no zest for the Mayfair game,\\" recalled his son Gilbert. Arthur Frankau \\"was very much the model of the self-denying, hard-working, family-oriented, successful Jewish businessman of popular legend.\\" \\"I naturally came to know Arthur Frankau well,\\" recalled his wife's friend and fellow-writer Marie Belloc Lowndes. \\"He had the cultivated, reserved manner which in those days was common in a type of German with whom I had come in contact, oddly enough, in Paris.\\"Mrs Belloc Lowndes, The Merry Wives of Westminster, Macmillan 1946 p. 60 By long-established verbal understanding, J. Frankau & Co. were the sole U.K. importers of Upmann cigars, which had been to the advantage of both parties. But this unwritten agreement was broken by the Upmanns in 1901: \\"If ever one man‚Äôs lies shortened another man‚Äôs life, they were Heinrich Upmann‚Äôs lies to my father,\\" wrote Gilbert Frankau.Gilbert Frankau, Self-Portrait, Hutchinson 1940, Ch. 11 \\"The shock of learning that his trusted associates had no conception of business honour turned his iron-grey hair nearly white.

History The Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff was originally directly responsible to the First Sea Lord for non-operational divisions of the Admiralty Naval Staff, and held a position on the Board of Admiralty. The position was created in 1917 as one of two deputies with Board Status to whom the First Sea Lord delegated responsibility for the running of the Naval Staff. The position still exists today on the Admiralty Board which directs the Royal Navy. Rear-Admiral Alexander L. Duff was appointed the first Assistant Chief of Naval Staff on 31 May 1917. The duties of the Assistant Chief of Naval Staff, shared with the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff and the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff. The Assistant Chief of Naval Staff Continued in this capacity until 1941 when the office of the Vice Chief of Naval Staff was created they then supported that flag officer until 1985 when that post was abolished. During World war Two the combined responsibilities of the Assistant Chief Naval Staff were divided up with the creation of new Assistant Chiefs of the Naval Staff responsible for specific areas such as Home (Waters) and Foreign Commands, Trade, Operations and Air. However the ACNS remained responsible for Policy. Additional Assistant Chiefs of Naval Staff New Additional Assistant Chiefs of Naval Staff were created for Warfare from 1953 to 1968 that was changed to Assistant Chief Naval Staff ‚Äî Operational Requirements until 1985.

The chapters in an edited volume are original works (not republished works). Alternative terms for edited volume are contributed volume, edited collection and multiauthor volume. All these terms emphasize that the book is a collection of chapters contributed by different authors and harmonized by an editor. Edited volumes are of interest in academic publishing because they present different viewpoints and experiences on a common theme. An edited volume is unlike an anthology, which is a collection of republished short literary works by different authors. It is also not a collected edition, which brings together already-published works by a single author and is edited by a publisher. It is different from a reader, which contains collected texts for learning purposes. Finally, it is different from proceedings, which contain articles written by different authors who present them at a scientific conference.  Role of the editor The editor (or editors, often there are several) of an edited volume is the key figure in conceiving and producing the book. He or she is responsible for determining the book's purpose, structure and style (as laid out in a book proposal); for signing a book contract with an interested publisher; and for selecting the individual contributors who will write the chapters (and possibly the foreword). Selecting the contributions may involve an open call for papers or may be conducted privately. The editor is also responsible for keeping the writing process on schedule and serves as the liaison between the publisher and the contributors. However, the task of \\"chasing contributions\\" can be substantial. The editor may also be a contributor to the volume, by writing some chapters (often with other authors) and especially by preparing a preface, an introduction or an afterword summarizing the main points. The editor also carries out the linguistic and substantive editing of the chapters before submitting the book manuscript to the publisher, and coordinates authors' review and correction of the proofs (preprints). Contributors' responsibilities Authors of individual chapters (contributors) sign contributor agreements that outline the topic and length of the chapter they are to write, the deadline for delivery, the copyright policy and the compensation (e.g. copies of the printed book). By accepting to contribute to the volume, they agree to prepare their chapters according to the book's style regarding, for example, the use of headings, illustrations, formatting and other text features.

A new building was constructed of native limestone. Up until World War I, classes were taught exclusively in the German language.

First appearing in the show's seventh series, Clara served as a companion of the alien time traveller known as the Doctor in his eleventh (Matt Smith) and twelfth (Peter Capaldi) incarnations. She remains the longest serving companion since the show's revival in 2005. Clara is initially presented to the audience during the seventh series as three distinct, though similarly named, people living in different eras. The first two incarnations, Oswin Oswald and Clara Oswin Oswald, each die during the episode in which they appear. The third incarnation becomes the Doctor's companion, travelling with him for the remainder of the series as he tries to uncover the mystery of her multiple lives. She continues to travel with the Doctor after the mystery is resolved at the end of the series, witnessing him regenerate into his twelfth incarnation in \\"The Time of the Doctor\\" (2013). The pair have various adventures together in the eighth and ninth series until she departs the show in \\"Hell Bent\\" (2015). She reappears briefly in the Christmas special \\"Twice Upon a Time\\" (2017). Coleman's performance as Clara was well received by critics. Appearances Television Oswin Oswald is introduced in the series 7 premiere, \\"Asylum of the Daleks\\" (2012). She is the sole survivor of the starship Alaska, which crashed on the Asylum, a prison planet for insane Daleks. Oswin then learns from the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) that she has been converted from human into a Dalek and has coped by retreating into a fantasy of her own intact survival. She assists the Doctor and his travelling companions, Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill), to escape the planet unharmed, but at the cost of her own life. Later, in the 2012 Christmas special \\"The Snowmen\\", the Doctor meets a woman named Clara Oswin Oswald, whom he initially knows only as Clara. She is a Victorian barmaid and governess whom the Doctor invites to be his newest companion, but who dies from an attack by one of the Great Intelligence's minions. Seeing her full name on her tombstone and finally recognising her voice, the Doctor realises she is the same woman as Oswin from the Dalek Asylum, whom he had never seen in her human form. Intrigued by the mystery of the woman who has lived and died twice in different eras, he begins searching across time for another Clara. Clara's book of 101 Places to See and the leaf, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience. In \\"The Bells of Saint John\\" (2013), Clara receives a phone number to the Doctor's time and space vessel, the TARDIS, from a mysterious woman. The Doctor finds Clara Oswald (this time with no middle name) in contemporary London through her phone call, and takes her on as a companion with a goal to solving the mystery of the \\"impossible girl\\". The Doctor's repeated attempts at investigating Clara's origins over the course of \\"The Rings of Akhaten\\", \\"Hide\\", and \\"Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS\\" consistently turn up compelling evidence that she is just a normal young human woman. In \\"Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS\\", the Doctor confronts Clara in an averted timeline about the two previous versions of her he had met, but she does not know what he is talking about. The mystery surrounding Clara is finally resolved in \\"The Name of the Doctor\\" when she sacrifices her existence by entering the Doctor's timestream to undo the harm caused by the Great Intelligence (Richard E Grant). This results in the creation of numerous incarnations of Clara throughout the Doctor's history who appear to every known face of the Doctor, saving his life in numerous ways. Very few Claras are noticed by the Doctor. One version of Clara successfully persuades the First Doctor (William Hartnell) to pick the \\"right\\" TARDIS on his home planet Gallifrey, prior to the events of the show's first episode. Lost in the Doctor's timestream, she is eventually rescued and brought back into existence by the Eleventh Doctor. In \\"The Day of the Doctor\\", the show's 50th anniversary special, Clara is shown to have become a teacher at Coal Hill School. While on an adventure with the Doctor, she meets the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) and the War Doctor (John Hurt) in person. She manages to convince the War Doctor to change his history (and thereby save Gallifrey and his people, the Time Lords, from destruction in the Time War), by sealing the planet in a \\"parallel pocket universe\\", where it remains. In \\"The Time of the Doctor\\", the Time Lords try to return to the universe through a crack in time, but if they do so, the Time War will begin anew. The Doctor sends Clara home to her family at Christmas twice while the Doctor stays on the planet Trenzalore to try and prevent this war, but she returns in the TARDIS each time, after two centuries-long intervals. With the Doctor facing certain death at the end of his regeneration cycle during this siege, she pleads with the Time Lords through the crack to save the Doctor; they grant him a new regeneration cycle and the crack closes. She then witnesses the Doctor regenerate into the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi). Clara spends some time grappling with losing the Doctor she knew and loved throughout the events of \\"Deep Breath\\" (2014), until a call from the Eleventh Doctor prior to his regeneration convinces her to stay by his side and help him adjust to his new persona. In \\"Into the Dalek\\", Clara and fellow teacher Danny Pink (Samuel Anderson) agree to go for drinks together, and over the course of the episodes \\"Listen\\", \\"Time Heist\\", and \\"The Caretaker\\", the two enter into a romantic relationship. For a while, she keeps secrets between the Doctor and Danny due to their misgivings about each other, and experiences turbulence in her friendship with the Doctor, particularly in \\"Kill the Moon\\", when he abandons her to face a traumatic decision on her own. In \\"Flatline\\", she is forced to take the Doctor's role in averting an alien invasion, and realises she is capable of making the same ruthless and pragmatic decisions he often has to make. In \\"Dark Water\\", Danny dies while crossing the road before Clara can announce her intent to commit to him fully. After attempting to blackmail the Doctor into changing history to avert his death, which is impossible, Clara and the Doctor decide to pursue contacting him from beyond the grave, and end up at a facility where evil Time Lord Missy (Michelle Gomez) has stored the consciousnesses of Earth's dead as part of a plot to convert all of the deceased into an army of Cybermen. In \\"Death in Heaven\\", Missy reveals that she was the aforementioned woman who gave Clara the TARDIS telephone number and had also been secretly keeping the two together after their first meeting as part of her plan. After Danny is brought back as a Cyberman in the episode, he resists his programming in order to destroy Missy's Cyberman army and avert her plans. Two weeks after these events, Clara and the Doctor meet to say goodbye to one another. The Doctor lies to Clara; he pretends he has found Gallifrey and a home to go back to. Clara lies too; she pretends Danny returned from the dead through Missy's device, when in fact he sacrificed his opportunity to save the life of the child he killed in the Afghanistan war. The two later reunite in the 2014 Christmas special \\"Last Christmas\\", when alien creatures induce a dream state in both the Doctor and Clara. Clara confesses that Danny is still dead, and the Doctor admits he did not find Gallifrey. Their shared dream experience on the North Pole ends with them regretting their parting. The Doctor asks Clara to resume travelling with him, and she happily agrees. In series 9, Clara accompanies Missy and the Doctor to Skaro when he is summoned by Davros (Julian Bleach), barely escaping the ordeal with her life. Now an experienced companion, Clara shows greater confidence when dealing with alien races and volatile humans, but the Doctor finds himself concerned by her reckless streak. Clara's recklessness gets the better of her in \\"Face the Raven\\", when she attempts to outsmart the Doctor's adversary Ashildr (Maisie Williams) by taking on a death sentence, but later learns that it cannot be revoked. She cautions the Doctor not to give in to his darker nature in response to her passing, and faces death with bravery. She is seen once more in the following episode \\"Heaven Sent\\", as a grief- stricken Doctor imagines conversations with her to clarify his ideas. In \\"Hell Bent\\", the Doctor uses Time Lord technology on Gallifrey to extract Clara from her last moments of life, and attempts to run away with her and cheat death. He later realises from Ashildr that travelling together will only cause more harm than good, and prepares to wipe Clara's memories of him with a device. Clara tampers with the device so that it wipes the Doctor's memories of her instead. She leaves the Doctor on Earth to start his adventures anew, and begins travelling with Ashildr in a stolen TARDIS with the intention of one day returning to Gallifrey to meet her end, although vowing to \\"take the long way around\\". In \\"Twice Upon a Time\\", the Doctor encounters Testimony, a futuristic organisation who use time travel to copy people's memories at the moment of death and install them in sentient glass avatars. At the end of an adventure, an avatar of Bill Potts restores the Doctor's memories of Clara with a mental image of her telling him not to forget her again. Other media Clara (Sophie Downham) appears in a short prelude to \\"The Bells of Saint John\\" as a child who talks to the Doctor at a playground. The Doctor does not realise her identity, which is revealed to the viewer. Coleman also played Clara in \\"She Said, He Said\\", an online prelude to \\"The Name of the Doctor\\" that breaks the fourth wall. The DVD and Blu-ray releases for Series 7 also include Coleman in a solo performance as Clara in the home media- exclusive short \\"Clara and the TARDIS\\". Clara also features alongside the Eleventh Doctor in the New Series Adventures novel Shroud of Sorrow (2013). From 2014, she has been featured in the Twelfth Doctor novels including: The Blood Cell, Silhouette, The Crawling Terror, and as of 2015, Royal Blood and Deep Time. She appeared in IDW Publishing's comic story Deadwood. Clara appeared briefly in issues 11 and 12 of IDW 50th anniversary Doctor Who mini- series \\"Prisoners of Time\\". Beginning with Issue #462 (August 2013), Clara appears regularly in the Doctor Who Magazine comic strips. In the 2015 Doctor Who Magazine comic storyline Blood and Ice (DWM #485‚Äì488), Clara meets another incarnation of herself she created called \\"Winnie Clarence\\", a university research graduate from the year 2048. Casting and development Jenna Coleman plays Clara. On 21 March 2012, it was announced that Jenna Coleman would replace Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill as the next companion. She auditioned for the role in secrecy, pretending it was for something called Men on Waves, an anagram for \\"Woman Seven\\". Executive producer and lead writer Steven Moffat chose her for the role because she worked the best alongside Smith and could talk faster than he did. Coleman had never seen Doctor Who before her audition, and watched \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" (2010) and \\"completely fell in love with the show\\". However, she only watched the first five episodes of the seventh series ‚Äì the final five featuring Gillan and Darvill ‚Äì because she did not want to learn more about their relationship to the Doctor, as she wanted her acting alongside Smith to be \\"spontaneous\\". Moffat stated that her character is different from previous companions, though he attempted to keep the details of her character a secret until she debuted in the Christmas special. In \\"Asylum of the Daleks\\" (2012), Coleman appears as the character Oswin Oswald, a secret which was kept from the public before transmission. Coleman was originally given the role of a Victorian governess named Jasmine, and then for the second audition she was given both the characters of Oswin and Clara. She originally thought that the producers were looking for the right character, but later realised it was part of Moffat's \\"soft mystery\\" plan. Neil Gaiman (writer of \\"Nightmare in Silver\\", 2013) revealed that the character was originally intended to stay as a Victorian governess. Coleman stated that Moffat came up with the mystery during the audition process. Coleman played each version of the character as individuals with \\"trust that there would be a payoff\\" to her mystery. Moffat told Neil Cross, who wrote \\"Hide\\" (2013), the first episode Coleman filmed as the new companion, that Clara was \\"a normal girl\\". Moffat felt that the introduction of a new companion made \\"the show feel different\\" and brought the story to \\"a new beginning\\" with a different person meeting the Doctor. Executive producer Caroline Skinner remarked that her introduction allowed the series to return to a more \\"classic Doctor Who format\\". Smith said that Clara was different from her predecessor Amy Pond (Gillan), which allowed the audience to see a different side of the Doctor. Moffat said that Coleman brings \\"a speed and wit and an unimpressed quality that makes the Doctor dance a bit harder\\". Coleman stated that her character \\"holds her own\\" and was competitive with the Doctor, providing \\"a nice double act\\". With her place in the series' narrative, Clara was intended to reawaken the Doctor's \\"curiosity in the universe and gives him his mojo back\\". Concerning Clara's relationship to the Doctor, Coleman said, \\"It's been interesting how it's changed Matt's Doctor. There is a natural bounce between them, and a flirtation, and attraction. But, again, they've always got this friction because they're a bit magnetic and drawn to each other, but she can't quite figure him out. He's got loads of secrets and he's always looking at her, trying to figure her out.\\" The dynamic between Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy was an influence on Coleman and Smith. In addition, Coleman revealed that Clara and the TARDIS have a \\"relationship\\", as there is a running joke about the TARDIS (previously established in the series as being sentient) not liking Clara or making fun of her. Many fans and critics noticed similarities between Clara and Billie Piper's Rose Tyler. Clara helps the Doctor recover at a dark point in his life, as Rose does during a much darker time; both companions lose a parent; each has a close relationship with the Doctor, who sees part of their childhood. The Doctor does the same thing to Clara in \\"The Time of the Doctor\\" (2013) as he does to Rose in \\"The Parting of the Ways\\" (2005) by sending her back home to keep her safe. It was widely expected that Coleman would leave the show at the end of 2014. Moffat has confirmed in numerous interviews that he wrote the character out twice ‚Äî once for the end of Series 8 and again for the 2014 Christmas special ‚Äî but ultimately convinced Coleman to stay on for one more series. On 18 September 2015, Coleman officially announced on BBC Radio 1 that she would leave the show at the end of the ninth series. Coleman reprised the role of Clara for a cameo appearance in the 2017 Christmas Special \\"Twice Upon a Time\\". Reception Nick Setchfield of SFX praised the effective surprise debut of Coleman as Oswin in \\"Asylum of the Daleks\\". He wrote, \\"Coleman brings sauce and sparkiness, and while she initially seems a familiar Moffat archetype, all snarky cracks about the Doctor's chin and throwaway lines about sexual experimentation... there's a deeper vulnerability there too, which makes her eventual fate in this episode genuinely heart-skewering.\\" Michael Hogan, writing for The Daily Telegraph, also found her debut promising and described her as \\"enchanting in an elfin way ‚Äì rather like a brunette, curvier, less annoying Fearne Cotton\\". The character's reintroduction as Clara in \\"The Snowmen\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. The Guardian's Dan Martin wrote, \\"The masterstroke behind Jenna-Louise Coleman's surprise introduction is that it made us want to see more of her before Karen Gillan had even gone. The cheeky, self-assured Clara won a place in our hearts from the off.\\" Setchfield called her \\"less of a motormouthed quip-merchant than [Oswin], but Coleman makes her equally winning ‚Äì plucky, smart and riffing on a very promising chemistry with Matt Smith\\". IGN's Matt Risley felt that Clara \\"trumped her already-bombastic debut with a character both fully formed and utterly unpredictable\\". He praised the mystery surrounding her and her independence, commenting that she seemed to be the \\"antithesis\\" of Amy Pond as she was \\"a girl who will wait for no-one\\". Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern admitted that he had \\"found Oswin's perkiness a tad wearing\\", but he was \\"completely won over\\" by Coleman's Clara in \\"The Snowmen\\". Neela Debanth of The Independent felt that Clara's demise in \\"The Snowmen\\" made the episode \\"a bit of a tease\\" and set up the question of what the travelling Clara would be like. Unlike Mulkern, she favoured the Oswin version, describing her as \\"much more fun and flirtatious\\". Following \\"The Bells of Saint John\\", Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery said that the new Clara was \\"more grounded and so far easier for the viewer to latch on to\\" than her two predecessors, both of whom could have been harder to sustain as companions. Mulkern said that he did not bother with the character's mystery and found it pleasing that Coleman played her as \\"a straightforward modern companion with no baggage\\". Setchfield described Clara as \\"equally sparky and winning but altogether younger and possibly just a tad more vulnerable than her previous incarnations\\" with a \\"helplessly watchable chemistry\\" with Smith. Debnath described her as a \\"softer version\\" of Oswin, still hoping that \\"the character will be taken up a notch, challenging the Doctor more and bouncing off him like Oswin did. However, the Daily Mirror's Jon Cooper expressed concern that Clara, despite Coleman's success, was too similar to Amy. Mike Higgins of The Independent felt that Coleman was \\"an improvement\\" upon Gillan, but wrote that \\"the pairing of an intellectually bright but emotionally dim male with a techno-illiterate but wised up female is a tired old trope of much drama and comedy\\". The character's development has also been met with positive reviews. Martin praised how her backstory was fleshed out in \\"The Rings of Akhaten\\", as otherwise the character \\"was danger of becoming simply a story arc in the shape of a girl\\". SFX's Richard Edwards wrote that she had the potential to be \\"a truly great companion\\", and that it was \\"refreshing to see a companion who isn't in total awe of the Doctor... and she's not afraid to take the lead when she needs to\\". Debnath praised her \\"caring nature\\" and \\"lovely maternal side\\", but felt that she could be \\"annoyingly na√Øve\\". Dave Golder of SFX stated that Clara was \\"to an extent, a bit of a cartoon character\\" and that Moffat was better at writing her in \\"The Name of the Doctor\\" than some of the preceding writers. He also commented that she \\"still feels too new a companion (and an underdeveloped one) to really care about her sacrifice\\".

She was elected to the Puerto Rico House of Representatives on the 2012 general election. She also served as Secretary General of the New Progressive Party (PNP). She is known for her controversial views against the LGBT community. She was arrested by the FBI in August 2020, and faces 13 charges of corruption for numerous crimes, which include theft and money laundering, perpetrated specifically through a kickback scheme. Early years and studies Mar√≠a Milagros Charbonier was born on November 24, 1963 in Fajardo, Puerto Rico to Roberto Charbonier and Milagros Laureano. She studied in various schools in the metropolitan area, graduating from high school in 1981 from the Dr. Jos√© M. L√°zaro High School. In 1986, Charbonier received a bachelor's degree in Arts, with a major in Social Science from the University of Puerto Rico in R√≠o Piedras. After that, she completed a Juris doctor from the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico School of Law. Charbonier passed the bar exam, which allows her to practice law in Puerto Rico. Professional career Charbonier has worked as an attorney, specializing in areas like Family, Criminal, Constitutional, and Environmental Law. She has also served as Legal Advisor to various municipalities in the island. As such, she was chosen to represent the Delegation of Lawyers of Carolina. She was then elected as delegate to the Board of Directors of the Puerto Rico Bar Association where she occupied the position of Vice-President. In recent years, Charbonier served as Administrative Judge of the Special Education Program of the Puerto Rico Department of Education. She has also worked for the Puerto Rico Police Department and the Department of Family Affairs of Puerto Rico. Charbonier has been censored by the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico for unethical conduct and faced three other complaints before the Supreme Court. The censorship by the Supreme Court was handed down in 2002 after she issued an affidavit as a notary in which she stated two witnesses who were not present were present. She faced a second complaint in 2006 when two individuals, one of whom was a former police agent, submitted a complaint after Charbonier publicly accused them of selling information to drug dealers; the complaint was dismissed by the Court. In 2015 a third complaint was heard before the Court after allegations she had over billed for legal work performed for the municipality of Canovanas, this complaint was dismissed because a majority of the Justices believed that it was unreasonable to ask Charbonier to explain events that had happened over a decade ago. She now faces a fourth ethical complaint due to a contract written by her as a notary in 1999. Political career Charbonier served as Secretary General of the New Progressive Party (PNP) during Pedro Rossell√≥'s tenure as Governor of Puerto Rico. She appeared in a ballot for the first time in 2008 when she ran for delegate from Puerto Rico to the 2008 Democratic National Convention. She was pledged to then Senator Barack Obama. She subsequently switched to the Republican Party and ran for delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention, pledged to Ben Carson. Charbonier won a spot on the PNP ballot at the primaries earlier in 2012. She arrived in fifth place in the voting. She was elected at the 2012 elections, receiving the second highest number of votes within her party, behind incumbent Speaker Jenniffer Gonz√°lez. After her reelection in 2016, Charbonier was named as the president of the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico Commission of the Judiciary. She is a controversial figure in politics due to her traditional views on LGBT individuals, the legalization of marijuana, among other subjects. As part of her anti-LGBT activism Charbonier has attempted to block same-sex marriage through the Courts by suing the governor arguing that the Supreme Court of the United States' decision in Obergefell v. Hodges did not apply to Puerto Rico because of its status as an unincorporated territory. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico handed down an opinion dismissing the claim and stating that the plaintiffs did not have a remote chance of prevailing. She has also been criticized for attempts at legalizing discrimination against LGBT individuals through religious exemptions and legislation. During public hearings in 2013 on a bill to extend protections against domestic violence to same sex couples, Charbonier compared homosexuality to pedophilia and bestiality, drawing criticism for other legislators and LGBTQ activists. On August 17, 2020 Charbonier was arrested by the FBI for multiple public corruption cases that were under investigation. The charges includes theft, bribery, kickbacks, and money laundering. The federal grand jury 13-count indictment is against Charbonier herself, her husband Orlando Montes-Rivera (Montes), their son Orlando Gabriel Montes-Charbonier, and Charbonier assistant Frances Acevedo- Ceballos (Acevedo). She presented her letter of resignation the next day, which will be effective on September 15, 2020. Personal life As of 2012, Mar√≠a Milagros Charbonier had been married for 28 years with attorney Orlando Montes Rivera. They have two children. On August 17, 2020 the FBI arrested Charbonier along with her husband and son.

It also lobbies on a range of social policy issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage from an evangelical Protestant perspective, and has been particularly influential with Democratic Unionist Party ministers in the Northern Ireland Executive. The Foundation describes its mission as \\"promoting the fundamentals of the historic evangelical Protestant faith\\". Structure, leadership and influence The Foundation was launched at a meeting held in the Park Avenue Hotel, Belfast on 16 October 1998, following an initial meeting in Ballymoney in February 1998 attended by delegates from a number of small evangelical Protestant churches. It is not a membership organisation. The Foundation is led by a \\"Council of Reference\\" including ministers, pastors and other activists from a variety of small Protestant sects. The largest single denomination represented is the Free Presbyterian Church founded by Rev. Ian Paisley, with others including the Congregational Union of Ireland, the Evangelical Presbyterian, Independent Methodist, Baptist, Reformed Presbyterian, Congregational Reformed and Elim Pentecostal churches, the Church of the Nazarene and the Evangelical Protestant Society. Prominent members of the Council (in 2012) include Ron Johnstone, who succeeded Paisley as leader of the Free Presbyterian Church; DUP MLA Mervyn Storey, also a Free Presbyterian; Philip Campbell, Convenor of the Public Morals Committee of the Congregational Union, and Free Presbyterian minister Alan Smylie, who conducted the funeral service for Shankill Butcher Robert Bates.Steve Bruce, Paisley: Religion and Politics in Northern Ireland, Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 221 Its first chairman, until his death in 2007, was George Dawson, an activist in Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and subsequently a DUP MLA. Dawson was Grand Master of the Independent Orange Order and Treasurer of the Evangelical Protestant Society. On his death, Rev. William Park became acting chairman. Its secretary for some time after the launch in 1998, David McConaghie acted until late 2012 as its press spokesman, and held other offices in the Foundation's Council of Reference. Wallace Thompson of the Evangelical Protestant Society, who had been the Foundation's treasurer since 1998, succeeded as chairman of the Foundation in September 2009, Park becoming vice-chairman. Thompson, who was a founding member of the DUP, is also an Orangeman, a former Northern Ireland Office civil servant, and a former ministerial adviser to Nigel Dodds. It was while employed in the last role, in 2008, that Thompson in a radio interview denounced the Pope as the Antichrist. Thompson is a member of the Public Morals Committee of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church. The secretary of the Foundation is Rev. Philip Campbell, Congregational minister in Coleraine. who replaced Rev Robert McEvoy in June 2013. This change formed part of an organisational re-structuring of the Foundation with the establishment of a steering committee which is empowered to make decisions and respond to events. Documenting the influence of the Foundation within Northern Ireland unionist politics, and particularly the DUP, the Belfast Telegraph noted in 2012 that politicians close to it included Northern Ireland health minister Edwin Poots, Minister for Social Development Nelson McCausland, junior minister Jonathan Bell, Diane Dodds MEP, Gregory Campbell MP, David Simpson MP, Paul Givan MLA, Stephen Moutray MLA (and mayor of Craigavon), Jim Allister, leader of Traditional Unionist Voice and TUV press officer and East Antrim parliamentary candidate Sammy Morrison. A leading Belfast Telegraph journalist wrote on another occasion that \\"Caleb plays a role within the DUP analogous to the old Militant tendency within the Labour party.\\" Also in 2012, the Irish Daily Star noted that Caleb \\"claims a support base of 200,000 evangelicals\\" and asked whether it had \\"overtaken the Orange Order as the most influential pressure group within Unionism\\". Activities The Foundation's lobbying to have public bodies give at least equal coverage to creationist beliefs as to scientific evidence of evolution came to attention in 1999, when McConaghie wrote in the Belfast News Letter in response to the BBC television series Walking with Dinosaurs, calling for \\"equal prominence to be given to the Creation creed\\". In 2006 McConaghie met senior officers of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to discuss the Foundation's request that figures for 'gay- on-gay' violence in Northern Ireland be collated and published, and that police figures for 'cohabiting same-sex' domestic violence be made available to the Foundation \\"for analysis\\". In 2008 the Foundation's spokesman called for the banning of the Belfast Gay Pride parade, complaining of the \\"gratuitously offensive and deliberately provocative behaviour emanating from participants\\". Also in 2008, the Foundation's website carried a photograph of a shop window display in Enniskillen and asked: \\"Is one of Northern Ireland's leading clothes chains promoting homosexuality?\\", pointing out \\"a pair of female mannikins [sic.] in the window of their Enniskillen store, holding hands.\\"Archived version of http://www.calebfoundation.org/ The Foundation lobbied the Ulster Museum in 2010 to feature creationist theories in its displays. The Foundation wrote to DUP minister Nelson McCausland and to National Museums Northern Ireland to express their concerns about the Museum's Nature Zone exhibits which described evolution as fact. McCausland subsequently wrote to the Museum trustees calling for alternative views of the origin of the universe to be accommodated in the museum's natural history displays. In 2010 the British Centre for Science Education published an 11,000-word report which accused the Foundation of promoting Christian fascism and Dominionism, aiming to make Northern Ireland a \\"fundamentalist Protestant theocracy\\". In 2011‚Äì12 the Foundation's press officer, David McConaghie, by then a full-time DUP official, lobbied two DUP ministers in the Northern Ireland Executive ‚Äì McCausland and Arlene Foster ‚Äì to have creationist theories included in displays at the new visitor centre at the Giant's Causeway. The lobbying involved other DUP members and evangelical churches. The National Trust included a \\"younger Earth\\" version of the origins of the Giant's Causeway at the visitor centre. In July 2012 McConaghie welcomed this as \\"recognition of the view, held by scientists right across the spectrum, that the scientific evidence points to a much younger age of the universe and to the direct involvement of a Divine Creator.\\" However, following widespread objections to the creationist content, the National Trust removed the display in October 2012. The Foundation has also lobbied for more representation by evangelical churches on BBC Northern Ireland, and in opposition to the relaxation of Sunday trading laws, the extension of gay rights, Sunday sport, a Marie Stopes clinic in Belfast and same-sex marriage. McConaghie met senior personnel from education bodies to lobby for the inclusion of a creationist viewpoint in the Northern Ireland curriculum. Other issues on which the Caleb Foundation has lobbied include the reform of prostitution laws, raising the retail price of alcohol and limiting pub opening hours, opposing the review of the abortion laws to include rape and foetal abnormality, and banning of gay adoption. While it did not specifically lobby for a ban on blood donation by gay men, it \\"approved of the position of the minister\\" Edwin Poots in retaining the ban. In November 2012 the Caleb Foundation announced that McConaghie had \\"voluntarily stepped down\\" from his role as its press officer, after he was arrested and charged with concealing a camera to spy on women in a toilet cubicle for purposes of sexual gratification. In October 2015, McConaghie was convicted of voyeurism for the offence, and subsequently jailed for three months and added to the sex offenders register for seven years.

Initially proposed as Shanghai‚ÄìNantong railway (Abbreviated as Hutong railway), construction works began in March 2014, and was expected to take five and a half years. The railway entered operations on July 1, 2020. The railway is designed to accommodate maximum train speeds of 200 km/h. and has reduced train travel time from Nantong to Shanghai to just over one hour. Routing The railway includes 137 km of new tracks, from Pingdong Station () on the Nanjing‚ÄìQidong railway northwest of downtown Nantong to Huangdu railway station on the Beijing‚ÄìShanghai railway, in the northwestern part of Shanghai City. Anting being within 20 km from Shanghai railway station, the total railway distance from Nantong to Shanghai is under 160 km. The railway crosses the Yangtze River over the new Hutong Yangtze River Bridge between Nantong and Zhangjiagang, a double-deck bridge with a 4-track railway on the lower deck and a 6-lane roadway on the upper deck. The bridge is the world's longest span (1092 metres) cable-stayed road-rail bridge with the highest (325 metres) piers of a cable-stayed road-rail bridge. The bridge is the easternmost railway crossing of the Yangtze. Previously, the only railway crossing in the Yangtze Delta region was a freight-only rail ferry on the Xinyi‚ÄìChangxing railway, between Jingjiang and Jiangyin, some 30 km upstream. The closet railway bridge is the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, over 200 km upstream. The new bridge thus greatly improves the railway connections between the Central Jiangsu (the region north of the Yangtze) and the Jiangnan, in particular Shanghai. On its way between the new bridge and Anting, the railway has brought rail service for the first time to properous communities on the southern bank of the Yangtze such as Zhangjiagang, Changshu, and Taicang which had no railway connection. In late 2019, the large Hutong Yangtze river bridge was completed, and the new line running from Anting west of Shanghai northwards to the river was nearing completion.

Gameplay Barkley 2 is an action role-playing game that Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Nathan Grayson describes will \\"marry the aesthetics and absurd narrative arcs of Japanese role-players with the openness of Western fare like The Elder Scrolls.\\" The game is designed to change the events in the storyline based on when a player completes certain content: in-game characters, places, and quests will vary depending on the player's actions. The combat in the game is inspired by a range of other titles, including Dark Souls and Borderlands. Development Tales of Game's Studios, the developers of Barkely 2, launched a Kickstarter campaign on November 28, 2012, to help crowdfund the costs of producing the game. The initial funding goal for the campaign was set at $35,000. The Kickstarter campaign officially ended with a total of $120,335. The game is a sequel to the studio's 2008 freeware title Barkley, Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden, which itself was created as a fan game sequel to the 1994 basketball game Barkley Shut Up and Jam! and the film Space Jam. The first game included players from the National Basketball Association (NBA), including Charles Barkley and LeBron James, and made many parodic references to popular culture. The game is styled after 16-bit era Japanese titles like the early games in the Final Fantasy series. The original was also turn-based whereas the sequel is an action RPG. Barkley 2 is being developed using Game Maker, the same creation kit that was used to create the first Barkley game. The developers announced on the Kickstarter campaign page that they anticipated a release in late 2013 or early 2014. A Tales of Game's staff member confirmed in an update to the campaign in late 2016 that their Kickstarter funds had been depleted, suggesting the game had fallen into development hell. On June 2, 2019, a Kickstarter update confirmed that the majority of developers have left the project and that development is moving slowly, with only two people left on the project working on it part-time, neither of them members of the original team that made the first game.

During the 1980s, the leading editors were Eugen Barbu and Corneliu Vadim Tudor and the newspaper had very strong pro-Nicolae Ceau»ôescu and National Communist views and it attacked and slandered detractors of Ceau»ôescu, both those living in Romania and those living in the exile. Ideology Following the speeches of the 1971 July Theses, through which Ceau»ôescu imposed a new ideology, Eugen Barbu, a writer seeing a waning influence, took the opportunity to be the greatest supporter of this new ideology of Protochronism.Deletant, p. 186 Antisemitism In a September 5, 1980 article entitled \\"Ideals\\", Corneliu Vadim Tudor presented the first anti-semitic view published in Romania after World War II. The article attacked the Jews, who, in contrast to the loyal Romanians were \\"running away in the face of hardships\\" (referring to Aliyah).Deletant, p. 191 The Jews were seen as \\"visitors\\", \\"avid for enrichment\\", \\"Herod's strangers to the interests of this nation\\" and who lacked the Romanian notion of self-sacrifice. Chief Rabbi of Romania, Moses Rosen protested by writing a letter to the newspaper and on October 24, a retraction was published, arguing that the newspaper did not support such extreme views.Deletant, p. 192 The debate over the issue continued as a brochure began to circulate in Romania, containing the SƒÉptƒÉm√Æna editorial, as well as Rabbi Rosen's protest under the title \\"Chief Rabbi Trafficker Patriot\\". While protests over the issue were voiced from Israel and other external Jewish circles, the official response was that they were printed abroad and shipped by Romanian-Italian businessman Iosif Constantin DrƒÉgan, who was alleged to have some links to SƒÉptƒÉm√Æna. In April 1981, Ceau»ôescu had to condemn anti-semitism in a speech. Nevertheless, it is alleged that the whole antisemitic incident was sparked by Ceau»ôescu's anger over the Jewish lobby which tried to tie the US Most favoured nation clause to the freedom to emigrate to Israel, something which was misunderstood by the sycophants at SƒÉptƒÉm√Æna. Conflict with the Writers' Union On September 18, 1980, the national communist group from SƒÉptƒÉm√Æna addressed Ceau»ôescu demanding the disbanding of the Writers' Union of Romania which they argued that it was \\"sold to the West\\" and \\"reactionary\\" and create a new Communist Writers' Union.Burakovski, p. 261 Ceau»ôescu realized that this was a fringe view among the writers and disagreed with this solution. On October 13, Ceau»ôescu discussed with a group of a hundred writers from the Writers' Union, who demanded that the activity of the SƒÉptƒÉm√Æna newspaper to be reproached and the reduction of the ideological pressures over the writers. While Ceau»ôescu agreed in principle, he was just postponing taking an action, which was taken after the 1981 Conference of the Writers' Union of Romania. Attacks on dissidents SƒÉptƒÉm√Æna had a habit of slandering all Romanian dissidents (both within and outside the country) or even people who they didn't see as patriotic enough. For instance, Eugen Barbu called Paul Goma \\"a nullity\\" on April 8, 1977.Deletant, p. 241 Legacy After 1989, the two former editors of SƒÉptƒÉm√Æna, Eugen Barbu and Corneliu Vadim Tudor became associates in a newspaper called Rom√¢nia Mare, which exposed extreme nationalist views. A party was created to suit their view, Greater Romania Party,Deletant, p. 400 which became the most important nationalist party in post-1989 Romanian history.

Renewed fighting began between S√©l√©ka and militias called anti-balaka. In September 2013, President Djotodia disbanded the S√©l√©ka coalition, which had lost its unity after taking power, and in January 2014, Djotodia resigned. He was replaced by Catherine Samba-Panza, but the conflict continued.

By the end of 2014, the country was de facto partitioned with the anti-Balaka controlling the south and west, from which most Muslims had evacuated, and ex-Seleka groups controlling the north and east. Much of the tension is over religious identity between Muslim S√©l√©ka fighters and Christian anti-balaka. Other contributing factors include ethnic differences among ex-S√©l√©ka factions and historical antagonism between agriculturalists, who largely comprise anti-balaka, and nomadic groups, who constitute most S√©l√©ka fighters. More than 1.1 million people have fled their homes in a country of about 5 million people, the highest ever recorded in the country. Background Rebels in northern Central African Republic in June 2007. The peacekeeping force Multinational Force in the Central African Republic (FOMUC) was formed in October 2002 by the regional economic community, Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC). After Fran√ßois Boziz√© seized power in 2003, the Central African Republic Bush War (2004‚Äì2007) began with the rebellion by the Union of Democratic Forces for Unity (UFDR) in North-Eastern CAR, led by Michel Djotodia. During this conflict, the UFDR rebel forces also fought with several other rebel groups including the Groupe d'action patriotique pour la lib√©ration de Centrafrique (GAPLC), the Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace (CPJP), the People's Army for the Restoration of Democracy (APRD), the Movement of Central African Liberators for Justice (MLCJ), and the Front d√©mocratique Centrafricain (FDC). Tens of thousands of people were displaced by the unrest, which continued until 2007, with rebel forces seizing several cities during the conflict. On 13 April 2007, a peace agreement between the government and the UFDR was signed in Birao. The agreement provided for an amnesty for the UFDR, its recognition as a political party, and the integration of its fighters into the army. Further negotiations resulted in an Libreville Global Peace Accord agreement in 2008 for reconciliation, a unity government, and local elections in 2009 and parliamentary and presidential elections in 2010. The new unity government that resulted was formed in January 2009. On 12 July 2008, with the waning of the Central African Republic Bush War, the larger overlapping regional economic community to CEMAC called the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) replaced FOMUC, whose mandate was largely restricted to security, with the Central African Peacebuilding Mission (MICOPAX), who had a broader peace building mandate. Rebel groups alleged that Boziz√© had not followed the terms of the 2007 agreement and that there continued to be political abuses, especially in the northern part of the country, such as \\"torture and illegal executions\\". Course of the conflict S√©l√©ka advances in C.A.R. (December 2012 ‚Äì March 2013) Toppling Boziz√© (2012‚Äì2013) =Formation of Seleka= In August 2012 a peace agreement was signed between the government and the CPJP. On 20 August 2012, an agreement was signed between a dissident faction of the CPJP, led by Colonel Hassan Al Habib calling itself \\"Fundamental CPJP\\". and the Patriotic Convention for Saving the Country (CPSK). Al Habib announced that, in protest of the peace agreement, the Fundamental CPJP was launching an offensive dubbed \\"Operation Charles Massi\\", in memory of the CPJP founder who was allegedly tortured and murdered by the government and that his group intended to overthrow Boziz√©. In September, fundamental CPJ, using the French name alliance CPSK-CPJP took responsibility for attacks on the towns of Sibut, Damara and Dekoa, killing two members of the army. It claimed that it had killed two additional members of the Central African Armed Forces (FACA) in Damara, capturing military and civilian vehicles, weapons including rockets, and communications equipment, and launched unsuccessful assault on a fourth town, Grimari and promised more operations in future. Mahamath Isseine Abdoulaye, president of the pro- government CPJP faction, countered that the CPJP was committed to the peace agreement and the attacks were the work of Chadian rebels, saying this group of \\"thieves\\" would never be able to march on Bangui. Al Habib was killed by the FACA on 19 September in Daya, a town north of Dekoa. In November 2012, in Obo, FACA soldiers were injured in an attack attributed to Chadian Popular Front for Recovery rebels. On 10 December 2012, the rebels seized the towns of N'D√©l√©, Sam Ouandja and Ouadda, as well as weapons left by fleeing soldiers.\\"A rebel attack on a Central African Republic town left at least four dead and 22 government troops captured by the rebels, sources said Saturday.\\" , Radio Netherlands Worldwide On 15 December, rebel forces took Bamingui, and three days later they advanced to Bria, moving closer to Bangui. The alliance for the first time used the name \\"Seleka\\" (meaning \\"union\\" in the Sango language) with a press release calling itself \\"S√©l√©ka CPSK-CPJP-UFDR\\" thus including the Union of Democratic Forces for Unity (UFDR). The S√©l√©ka claim they are fighting because of a lack of progress after a peace deal ended the Bush War. Following an appeal for help from Central African President Fran√ßois Boziz√©, the President of Chad, Idriss D√©by, pledged to send 2000 troops to help quell the rebellion. The first Chadian troops arrived on 18 December to reinforce the CAR contingent in Kaga Bandoro, in preparation for a counter-attack on N'D√©l√©. S√©l√©ka forces took Kabo on 19 December, a major hub for transport between Chad and CAR, located west and north of the areas previously taken by the rebels. On 18 December 2012, the Chadian group Popular Front for Recovery (FPR) announced their allegiance to the S√©l√©ka coalition. On 20 December 2012, a rebel group based in northern CAR, the Democratic Front of the Central African People (FDPC) joined the Seleka coalition. Four days later the rebel coalition took over Bambari, the country's third largest town, followed by Kaga-Bandoro on 25 December. Rebel forces reached Damara, bypassing the town of Sibut where around 150 Chadian troops are stationed together with CAR troops that withdrew from Kaga-Bandoro. On 26 December, hundreds of protesters surrounded the French embassy accusing the former colonial power of failing to help the army. Josu√© Binoua, the CAR's minister for territorial administration, requested that France intervenes in case the rebels, now only away, manage to reach the capital Bangui. On 27 December, Boziz√© asked the international community for assistance. French President Fran√ßois Hollande rejected the appeal, saying that French troops would only be used to protect French nationals in the CAR, and not to defend Boziz√©'s government. Reports indicated that the U.S. military was preparing plans to evacuate \\"several hundred\\" American citizens, as well as other nationals. General Jean-Felix Akaga, commander of the Economic Community of Central African States' (ECCAS) Multinational Force of Central Africa, said the capital was \\"fully secured\\" by the troops from its MICOPAX peacekeeping mission, adding that reinforcements should arrive soon. However, military sources in Gabon and Cameroon denied the report, claiming no decision had been taken regarding the crisis. Government soldiers launched a counterattack against rebel forces in Bambari on 28 December, leading to heavy clashes, according to a government official. Several witnesses over away said they could hear detonations and heavy weapons fire for a number of hours. Later, both a rebel leader and a military source confirmed the military attack was repelled and the town remained under rebel control.

Meanwhile, the foreign ministers in the ECCAS announced that more troops from the Multinational Force for Central Africa (FOMAC) would be sent to the country to support the 560 members of the MICOPAX mission already present. The announcement was done by Chad's Foreign Minister Moussa Faki after a meeting in the Gabonese capital Libreville. At the same time, ECCAS deputy secretary general Guy-Pierre Garcia confirmed that the rebels and the CAR government had agreed to unconditional talks, with the goal to get to negotiations by 10 January at the latest. In Bangui, the U.S. Air Force evacuated around 40 people from the country, including the American ambassador. The International Committee of the Red Cross also evacuated eight of its foreign workers, though local volunteers and 14 other foreigners remained to help the growing number of displaced people.\\"Fresh fighting in the C. African Republic as crisis grows\\". The Star (Malaysia), 29 December 2012. Rebel forces took over the town of Sibut without firing a shot on 29 December, as at least 60 vehicles with CAR and Chadian troops retreated to Damara, the last city standing between S√©l√©ka and the capital. In Bangui, the government ordered a 7 pm to 5 am curfew and banned the use of motorcycle taxis, fearing they could be used by rebels to infiltrate the city. Residents reported many shop-owners had hired groups of armed men to guard their property in anticipation of possible looting, as thousands were leaving the city in overloaded cars and boats. The French military contingent rose to 400 with the deployment of 150 additional paratroopers sent from Gabon to Bangui M'Poko International Airport.

Djouma Narkoyo confirmed that S√©l√©ka had stopped their advance and will enter peace talks due to start in Libreville on 8 January, on the precondition that government forces stop arresting members of the Gula tribe. The rebel coalition confirmed it would demand the immediate departure of president Bozize, who had pledged to see out his term until its end in 2016. By 1 January reinforcements from FOMAC began to arrive in Damara to support the 400 Chadian troops already stationed there as part of the MICOPAX mission. With rebels closing in on the capital Bangui, a total of 360 soldiers were sent to boost the defenses of Damara ‚Äì Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 120 each from Gabon, Republic of the Congo and Cameroon, with a Gabonese general in command of the force. Jean-F√©lix Akaga, the Gabonese general in charge of the MICOPAX force sent by the ECCAS, declared that Damara represented a \\"red line that the rebels cannot cross\\", and that doing so would be \\"a declaration of war\\" against the 10 members of the regional bloc. France had further boosted its presence in the country to 600 troops. On 6 January, South African President Jacob Zuma announced the deployment of 400 troops to the CAR to assist the forces already present there. On 11 January 2013, a ceasefire agreement was signed in Libreville, Gabon. On 13 January, Boziz√© signed a decree that removed Prime Minister Faustin-Archange Touad√©ra from power, as part of the agreement with the rebel coalition. The rebels dropped their demand for President Fran√ßois Boziz√© to resign, but he had to appoint a new prime minister from the opposition by 18 January 2013. On 17 January, Nicolas Tiangaye was appointed Prime Minister.Patrick Fort, \\"Tiangaye named Central African PM, says 'hard work' begins\\", Agence France-Presse, 17 January 2013. The terms of the agreement also included that National Assembly of the Central African Republic be dissolved within a week with a year-long coalition government formed in its place and a new legislative election be held within 12 months (with the possibility of postponement). In addition the temporary coalition government had to implement judicial reforms, amalgamate the rebel troops with the Boziz√© government's troops to establish a new national military, set up the new legislative elections, as well as introduce other social and economic reforms. Furthermore, Boziz√©'s government was required to free all political prisoners imprisoned during the conflict, and foreign troops must return to their countries of origin. Under the agreement, S√©l√©ka rebels were not required to give up the cities they have taken or were then occupying, allegedly as a way to ensure that the Boziz√© government would not renege on the agreement. Boziz√© would be allowed to remain President until new presidential elections in 2016. On 23 January 2013, the ceasefire was broken, with the government blaming S√©l√©ka and S√©l√©ka blaming the government for allegedly failing to honor the terms of the power-sharing agreement.

On 15 February, France announced that it would send an additional 400 troops to the country. French President Fran√ßois Hollande's office called for \\"increased solidarity\\" with the CAR and for the United Nations Security Council to accelerate the deployment of peacekeeping troops to the CAR. Moon then also called for the rapid deployment of 3,000 additional international peacekeepers. Because of increasing violence, on 10 April 2014, the UN Security Council transferred MISCA to a UN peacekeeping operation called the Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) with 10,000 troops, to be deployed in September that year. MINUSCA drew figurative \\"red lines\\" on the roads to keep the peace among rival militias. France called for a vote at the UNSC in April 2014 and expected a unanimous resolution authorising 10,000 troops and 1,800 police to replace the over 5,000 African Union soldiers on 15 September; the motion was then approved. After an incident where civilians were killed that involved Chadian soldiers, Chad announced the withdrawal of its forces from MISCA in April 2014. As UN Secretary-General Ban-ki Moon warned of a de facto partition of the country into Muslim and Christian areas as a result of the sectarian fighting, He also called the conflict an \\"urgent test\\" for the UN and the region's states. Amnesty International blamed the anti-balaka militia of causing a \\"Muslim exodus of historic proportions.\\" Samba-Panza suggested poverty and a failure of governance was the cause of the conflict. Some Muslims of the country were also weary of the French presence in MISCA, with the French accused of not doing enough to stop attacks by Christian militias. One of the cited reasons for the difficulty in stopping attacks by anti-balaka militias was the mob nature of these attacks. Burundian peacekeepers in Bangui. After three days of talks, a ceasefire was signed on 24 July 2014 in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo. The S√©l√©ka representative was General Mohamed Moussa Dhaffane, and the anti-balaka representative was Patrick Edouard Ngaissona. The talks were mediated by Congolese president Denis Sassou Nguesso. The S√©l√©ka delegation had pushed for a formalization of the partition of the Central African Republic with Muslims in the north and Christians in the south but dropped that demand in talks. Many factions on the ground claimed the talks were not representative and fighting continued with S√©l√©ka's military leader Joseph Zindeko rejected the ceasefire agreement the next day saying it lacked input from his military wing and brought back the demand for partition. Ngaissona told a general assembly of Antibalaka fighters and supporters to lay down their arms and that Antibalaka would be turned into a political party called Central African Party for Unity and Development (PCUD) but he had little control over the loose network of fighters. In May 2015, a national reconciliation conference organized by the transition government of the Central Africa Republic took place. This was called the Bangui National Forum. The forum resulted in the adoption of a Republican Pact for Peace, National Reconciliation and Reconstruction and the signature of a Disarmament, Demobilisation, Rehabilitation and Repatriation (DDRR) agreement among 9 of 10 armed groups.Central African Republic militias agree to disarmament deal Reuters. 10 May 2014.

Retrieved 14 July 2014 Later in 2014, Noureddine Adam led the FPRC and began demanding independence for the predominantly Muslim north, a move rejected by another general, Ali Darassa, who formed another Ex-S√©l√©ka faction called the \\"Union for Peace in the Central African Republic\\" (UPC), which was dominant in and around Bambari, while the FPRC's capital is in Bria. Darassa rebuffed multiple attempts to reunify Seleka and threatened FPRC's hegemony. Noureddine Adam declared the autonomous Republic of Logone or Dar El Kuti on 14 December 2015 and intended Bambari as the capital, with the transitional government denouncing the declaration and MINUSCA stating it will use force against any separatist attempt. Another group is the \\"Central African Patriotic Movement\\" (MPC), founded by Mahamat Al Khatim. Faustin Touad√©ra succeeds interim head Catherine Samba-Panza to become President following the 2016 election. Since 2014, there has been little government control outside of the capital. Armed entrepreneurs have carved out personal fiefdoms in which they set up checkpoints, collect illegal taxes, and take in millions of dollars from the illicit coffee, mineral, and timber trades. At least 14 armed groups vied for territory, notably four factions formed by ex-S√©l√©ka leaders who controlled about 60% of the country's territory. In January 2015, talks in Nairobi between Joachim Kokate representing the Antibalaka and Djotodia and Noureddine Adam of FPRC led to another ceasefire agreement where they called for amnesty for all perpetrators of abuses and the removal of the current transitional authorities. The transitional government and the international community dismissed the deal as it excluded them from the negotiations and termed the parties \\"Nairobists\\". By October 2015, Samba-Panza accused the Nairobists of plotting a coup and dozens of FPRC combatants even walked from the north-east of the country to Sibut, a few miles from the capital, threatening the transitional authorities but were stopped by International forces. With the de facto partition of the country between ex-S√©l√©ka militias in the north and east and Antibalaka militias in the south and west, hostilities between both sides decreased but sporadic fighting continued. In February 2016, after a peaceful election, the former Prime Minister Faustin-Archange Touad√©ra was elected president. In October 2016, France announced that it was ending its peacekeeping mission in the country, Operation Sangaris and largely withdrew its troops, saying that the operation was a success. By March 2014, the UNSC had authorised a probe into possible genocide, which in turn followed International Criminal Court Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda initiating a preliminary investigation into the \\"extreme brutality\\" and whether it falls into the court's remit. The UNSC mandate probe would be led by Cameroonian lawyer Bernard Acho Muna, who was the deputy chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, former Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs Jorge Casta√±eda and Mauritanian lawyer Fatimata M'Baye. The ICC began prosecutions and Alfred Yekatom of the antiBalaka who was involved in the 'Battle of Bangui' and Patrice Edouard Ngaissona of the antiBalaka were arrested in 2018, although no one from the ex-Seleka was arrested. Tensions erupted in competition between Ex-Seleka militias arising over control of a goldmine in November 2016, where MPC and the FPRC coalition which incorporated elements of their former enemy, the Anti-balaka, attacked UPC. The violence is often ethnic in nature with the FPRC associated with the Gula and Runga people and the UPC associated with the Fulani. Most of the fighting was in the centrally located Ouaka prefecture, which has the country's second largest city Bambari, because of its strategic location between the Muslim and Christian regions of the country and its wealth. The fight for Bambari in early 2017 displaced 20,000. MINUSCA made a robust deployment to prevent FPRC taking the city and in February 2017, Joseph Zoundeiko, the chief of staff of FPRC who previously led the military wing of Seleka, was killed by MINUSCA after crossing one of the red lines. At the same time, MINUSCA negotiated the removal of Darassa from the city. This led to UPC to find new territory, spreading the fighting from urban to rural areas previously spared. Additionally, the thinly spread MINUSCA relied on Ugandan as well as American special forces to keep the peace in the southeast as they were part of a campaign to eliminate the Lord's Resistance Army but the mission ended in April 2017. By the latter half of 2017, the fighting largely shifted to the Southeast where the UPC reorganized and were pursued by the FPRC and antibalaka with the level of violence only matched by the early stage of the war. About 15,000 people fled from their homes in an attack in May and six U.N. peacekeepers were killed ‚Äì the deadliest month for the mission yet. In June 2017, another ceasefire was signed in Rome by the government and 14 armed groups including FPRC but the next day fighting between an FPRC faction and antibalaka militias killed more than 100 people. In October 2017, another ceasefire was signed between the UPC, the FPRC, and anti-balaka groups and FPRC announced Ali Darassa as coalition vice-president but fighting continued afterward. By July 2018, FPRC, now headed by Abdoulaye Hiss√®ne and based in the northeastern town of Nd√©l√©, had troops threatening to move onto Bangui. In Western CAR, another rebel group, with no known links to Seleka or Antibalaka, called \\"Return, Reclamation, Rehabilitation\\" (3R) formed in 2015 reportedly by self-proclaimed general Sidiki Abass, claiming to be protecting Muslim Fulani people from an Antibalaka militia led by Abbas Rafal. They are accused of displacing 17,000 people in November 2016 and at least 30,000 people in the Ouham-Pend√© prefecture in December 2016. In Northwestern CAR around Paoua, fighting since December 2017 between Revolution and Justice (RJ) and Movement for the Liberation of the Central African Republic People (MNLC) displaced around 60,000 people. MNLC, founded in October 2017, was led by Ahamat Bahar, a former member and co-founder of FPRC and MRC, and is allegedly backed by Fulani fighters from Chad. The Christian militant group RJ was formed in 2013, mostly by members of the presidential guard of former President Ange Felix Patass√©, and were composed mainly of ethnic Sara-Kaba. While both groups had previously divided the territory in the Northwest, tensions erupted after the killing of RJ leader, Cl√©ment B√©langa, in November 2017. Beginning around 2017, Russia began to increasingly support the government of Touad√©ra, whose personal guard became largely Russian as well. Three Russian journalists were killed in 2018 while investigating Russian mercenary groups in CAR. In August 2018, Russia and Sudan helped broker another tentative agreement among armed groups. After talks in Khartoum, an African Union led initiative led to an accord between the government and 14 rebel groups in February 2019, the eighth such agreement since the war started in 2012. As part of the accord, Ali Darassa of UPC, Mahamat Al Khatim of MPC and Sidiki Abass of 3R were given positions as special military advisers to the prime minister's office overseeing special mixed units made of government and rebel soldiers in regions of the country that they already controlled. This did not stop the violence, with 3R killing more than 50 people in several villages in May 2019, leading to MINUSCA to launch a military operation against them. In August 2019, Sidiki Abbas of 3R and Mahamat Al Khatim of MPC resigned from their government posts. Democratic Front of the Central African People (FDPC) leader Abdoulaye Miskine refused to take his government post and joined a new rebel group formed in June 2019 called Parti du Rassemblement de la Nation Centrafricaine (PRNC) to oppose the peace deal, claiming that the deal is a way of rebel leaders to gain money and posts from the government. In September 2019, fighting between two rebel groups that signed the February 2019 deal, FPRC and the mostly Kara Movement of Central African Liberators for Justice (MLCJ), which was founded by Abakar Sabon and was not part of the Seleka alliance that overthrew Bozize, killed at least 24 people and displaced about 24,000. On 6 February 2019, representatives of the CAR government and fourteen recognized rebel groups signed a new peace treaty, the Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation, in Bangui. ‚Ä¢ \\"Talks leading to the accord took place in Khartoum from Jan. 24 ‚Äì Feb. 5 of this year and were led by the African Union (AU) and the United Nations, with support from ECCAS in the lead-up and follow-up to the process. The U.S., the European Union (EU), and Russia also helped support preparations for the talks. . . During the preparations for the dialogue, Russia, in conjunction with Sudan, attempted to initiate a separate peace process. Ultimately, the two processes were merged to prevent them from undermining one another.\\" The party of former President Francois Bozize announced his return to the country in December 2019. On 17 February 2020, members of the Popular Front for the Rebirth of Central Africa (FPRC) attacked MINUSCA forces in Birao, leading to 12 FPRC forces being killed. Atrocities Religious cleansing It is argued that the focus of the initial disarmament efforts exclusively on the Seleka inadvertently handed the anti-Balaka the upper hand, leading to the forced displacement of Muslim civilians by anti-Balaka in Bangui and western CAR. While comparisons were often posed as the \\"next Rwanda\\", others suggested that the Bosnian Genocide's may be more apt as people were moving into religiously cleansed neighbourhoods. Even while Seleka was closing in on the capital, clashes began in Bangui's PK5 neighborhood, where members of ethnic groups with ties to S√©l√©ka were attacked, such as the Gula. In 2014, Amnesty International reported several massacres committed by the anti-balakas against Muslim civilians, forcing thousands of Muslims to flee the country. Other sources report incidents of Muslims being cannibalized. On 10 April, MISCA troops escorted over 1,000 Muslims fleeing to Chad with a police source saying \\"not a single Muslim remains in Bossangoa.\\" Much of the tension is also over historical antagonism between agriculturalists, who largely comprise Anti- balaka and nomadic groups, who largely comprise Seleka fighters. In 2015, Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said 417 of the country's 436 mosques had been destroyed, and Muslim women were so scared of going out in public they were giving birth in their homes instead of going to the hospital. Eric Danboy Bagale, head of former president Fran√ßois Boziz√©'s guard and head of the mostly Christian anti-Balaka militias, was arrested in Paris on September 19, 2020 for war crimes in relation to revenge killings. Ethnic violence There was ethnic violence during fighting between the Ex-S√©l√©ka militias FPRC and UPC, with the FPRC targeting Fulani people who largely make up the UPC and the UPC targeting the Gula and Runga people, who largely make up FPRC, as being sympathetic to FPRC. In November 2016 fighting in Bria that killed 85 civilians, FPRC was reported targeting Fulani people in house-to-house searches, lootings, abductions and killings. It is also reported that in 2019, violence broke out in the northeastern, where the killing of an ethnic Kara man sparked heavy fighting between the mainly Kara MLCJ and largely Runga FPRC.  Violence against aid workers and crime In 2015, humanitarian aid workers in the CAR were involved in more than 365 security incidents, more than Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia. By 2017, more than two-thirds of all health facilities have been damaged or destroyed. The crimes are often committed by individuals not associated with any armed rebel groups. There have been jail breaks with more than 500 inmates escaping from Nagaragba Central Prison, including fighters of both Christian and Muslim militias. By 2017, only eight of 35 prisons function and few courts operate outside the capital. The international press freedom organization Reporters Without Borders said it was concerned that the rebel attacks were taking their toll on the ability of radio stations to operate in the CAR, with condemnation of the killing of journalist Elisabeth Blanche Olofio, who worked for Radio B√©-Oko which is part of a network of apolitical radio stations known as L'Association des Radios Communautaires de Centrafrique.

Displaced people In May 2014, it was reported that around 600,000 people in CAR were internally displaced with 160,000 of these in the capital Bangui. The Muslim population of Bangui dropped 99% from 138,000 to 900. By May 2014, 100,000 people had fled to neighbouring Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Chad. As of 2017, there are more than 1.1 million displaced people in a country of about 5 million people, the highest ever recorded in the country, with about half a million refugees outside CAR and about 600,000 internally displaced. Cameroon hosted the most refugees, more than 135,000, about 90% of whom are Fulani, even though they constituted 6% of CAR's population.

CSM is a social and political movement which aims, with the help of citizens and social organizations, to build the \\"Human Society\\", the society of every single human‚Äîthe whole human. It aims to build this society in peaceful ways and through the politics of causes rather than those of persons. Definition and Vision CSM helps to build free, democratic and secular citizens through the basic principles of secularism, democracy, participation, sovereignty, justice, development, transparency and Arabianism. The CSM aims for a fair, democratic, and secular country built by free citizens that is open to its surroundings and the world. It is based on the principle that a human being has an absolute value. The Civil Society Movement was founded by Gr√©goire Haddad in 1998. The Basic Principles The Civil Society Movement strives for development and change on all levels through spreading culture and increasing the level of awareness among people. Its purpose is to build a free, democratic, secular citizen, and a humanitarian society, following the listed principles: Sovereignty Lebanon is an independent sovereign country, in which citizens live in complete freedom and enjoy their duties. The CSM also believes that there can be neither sovereignty nor freedom in Lebanon under a sectarian or tribal regime, and while Israel still occupies part of its lands. Secularism The CSM defines secularism as an inclusive view of society, individuals and mind. It stresses the independence of all the civil world's constituents, dimensions, values and attitudes from all religions and philosophical sects. Secularism is of a positive neutrality towards all religions. This includes the independence of religion from sectarianism, and the independence of sects from the governmental system. Secularism seeks to re-establish the citizen's human worth in order to re-establish the humanitarian values which transcend instincts and fanaticism. The result would be reviving noble values such as righteousness, goodness and beauty, the things that pave the way to true citizenship. Democracy The movement believes democracy is at the base of any free social or political system. Democracy introduces autonomy through giving the people the right to elect their representative bodies which are supposed to reign in their name and for their welfare. Suffrage and the right to choose are at the base of democracy, which would not function properly without laws, institutions, a fitting framework, an appropriate atmosphere and actual practice. Partnership The CSM defines partnership as one of the loftiest forms of democracy. Partnership erupts out of democracy to develop it and activate it; in partnership, the citizens can share in applying the policies which the legislative and executive authorities put down. Participation means establishing decentralization, so that the community would be able to supervise, call into account, and share in the general affairs of the country. Supervision would take place through the local boards elected by the neighborhood, village, city, district, and governorate. It means the people are running their own affairs. Partnership also entails creating new economic devices, supporting small and local cooperatives, and organizing services on all levels. Transparency According to the CSM, transparency is one integral element of the democratic process, together with the right to vote and the right of surveillance. Transparency is synonymous with partnership and development as far as it is a means of knowledge and surveillance. It is displemed in the right of the citizen to know and the duty of the authorities to tell the truth and uncover facts. Without transparency there remains none but the freedom to choose between bad and worse. The absence of knowledge means the absence of freedom. Equity The CSM believes equity is the building block of society's existence, and has a great role in organizing the individual's relations in that society. It is based on rightful citizenship which contrasts with all forms of sectarian, doctrinal or zonal segregation. It is also built on the principle of equal opportunities and equality on all levels, starting with the right of the citizen to a clean, healthy environment ending with the right tp a respectable living. What secures equity is the state of law and establishments, which guards the rights of the citizens. Civilization The highest aim of civilization and human advancement is the development of all of man-kind on all levels. Comprehensive development includes in its scope all of the citizens dispersed all over the nation, and it covers all fields whether educational, cultural, social, economic, environmental or political. Thus, development should be complementative, that is by organizing its operations in a balanced, harmonic way, and by pursuing its goals in a cooperative, interactive manner. This way, all levels of development would progress simultaneously all People are rightfully entitled to inclusive, complementary development. Arabianism The movement defines Arabianism as a common civilization, culture and history, and a shared destiny, put together to build a free, democratic, non-sectarian Arabic society. The first step would be establishing an economic complementarity, to reach a socio-cultural intercommunication among the peoples of that society. The principles are used to provoke thought and discussion. an approach which the ‚ÄúMovement‚Äù seeks to spread in order to revive and revitalize the society. The CSM is trying to find new and original intellectual fountains rooted in the heart and experiences of our civil society. Its organizational structure is based on the simplicity of the idea that people need to work and interact within a unified framework, with the aim of bringing about change and humankind's prosperity.

He also earned a reputation for eccentricity, in part for requiring diners to eat their prix fixe meals while bound and blindfolded. According to Liebrandt, it was the pastry chef's idea and only happened on two occasions. Liebrandt quit the restaurant after a few months when it dropped his avant-garde menu in favour of \\"burgers and fries\\", in response to diners' post-9/11 preference for comfort food.

Early life Carleton Byron Swift Jr. was born on 4 July 1919 in Portland, Oregon, and studied engineering at Harvard where he graduated in 1941. He was the son of Carleton Byron Swift and his wife, Lila Leonard. His father was a member of the Swift meat-packing family.

His and Patti's mission was to assist in the repatriation of allied prisoners of war which the U.S. government was concerned the Japanese might hurt following the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and secondly to gather intelligence. During their time in Hanoi the OSS officers and their team met with Ho Chi Minh and although Swift did not speak French as Patti did he also met with Ho Chi Minh on at least one occasion. Swift denied that the U.S. could have been significant in creating the Viet Minh because the OSS had never had more than three 12-14 man commando teams operating in Indochina. Swift and Patti both left Hanoi at the end of September, 1945 after the French alleged that the Americans had been fomenting a revolution there.

The area was originally known as Orphans in honor of Albert Genavie Williamson, a Dodge County entrepreneur, and his five younger orphaned brothers who moved there in 1873-74 from North Carolina. About 1885, A. G. Williamson donated the land and built the Orphans Christian Church. When a neighbor's child, George Paul Alexander Barnes, died in 1887, Williamson donated a burial plot across the road from the church. After the funeral, he had a magnolia tree planted by the child's grave. Other burials followed. The earliest were infants and young children of the Thomas, Weldy, and Lashley families. Other common names in the original acre are Hardy, Manley, Steele, Stuckey, and Williamson. On August 17, 1912, Williamson had a twin mausoleum and columned canopy, built from Georgia marble, erected at the cemetery. Under the canopy above the mausoleum is life-size statuary depicting A. G., his wife, Martha J. Buchan Williamson, and their nephew, Jay Gould Williamson. The statuary was sculpted from Italian marble in Carrara, Italy, based on a family photograph. A. G. and Martha Williamson are buried in the mausoleum and other members of the Williamson family, including three of the orphaned brothers, are buried around it in a lot surrounded by a wrought iron fence that was erected around 1912. The original magnolia tree, designated as Mr. Williamson's Magnolia, still stands in the cemetery near the mausoleum.

Thirteenth Avenue is the commercial center of the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Borough Park, and Dyker Heights. 13th Avenue starts at 36th Street in Kensington. It maintains a relatively straight route through Borough Park and ends at 86th Street in Dyker Heights. The avenue is long. It is part of a one-way pair with Fourteenth Avenue, being one-way southbound to 60th Street (14th Avenue is one-way northbound north of New Utrecht Avenue and 60th Street). While New York neighborhoods have no official boundaries, the two neighborhoods meet approximately in the area of 65th Street.Walsh, Kevin (September 4, 2006) 13TH AVENUE, Brooklyn. Forgotten New York\\". In an approximately section traversing Borough Park, the street contains a huge variety of stores, businesses and food establishments catering to the local and international Haredi Jewish community. Borough Park section The avenue extends roughly in length through Borough Park, and contains a huge variety of stores, businesses and food establishments catering to the local and international Haredi Jewish community. While the sidewalks and streets are heavily congested during the week, all stores and businesses are shuttered on the Jewish Sabbath and Jewish holidays. In December 2012, the stretch of 13th Avenue from 36th to 60th Streets was co-named Raoul Wallenberg Way in honor of the Swedish diplomat who saved 100,000 Hungarian Jews during the Holocaust. Many of these survivors settled in Borough Park after the war and raised their families here. History Jewish immigrants began populating Borough Park at the turn of the 20th century. Through the 1930s, 13th Avenue was lined with pushcart vendors and pickle sellers. In the late 1930s the city opened a public market on 42nd Street to force an end to the pushcart trade. Thirteenth Avenue gentrified into an avenue of specialty shops interspersed with regular merchandise stores, and the avenue itself turned into a place \\"to see and be seen\\". Demographics B16 bus on 13th Avenue at 47th Street in Borough Park In the 1980s the religious Jewish demographic of Borough Park shifted from Modern Orthodox to Hasidic families. In response, new shops and restaurants opened on 13th Avenue to serve the expanding Haredi community. In 1987 two of the most popular stores debuted: Eichler's Judaica bookstore and Kosher Castle Dairy Cafeteria. New stores also opened selling imported goods and computer technology. At the end of the 1990s, businesses began selling electronics and Jewish books, music and videos to overseas customers via the Internet. Growth Observers credit the younger generation of Borough Park, who prefer to do business with other Jews, for fueling 13th Avenue's commercial growth. Most businesses are independently owned. One sign of the strong 13th Avenue economy is the heavy concentration of banks lining the avenue, including two JP Morgan banks standing one block apart, at 48th and 49th streets. In 2009 a ten-block strip of 13th Avenue, from 45th to 55th Streets, had 14 banks, with two more opening by 2010. Flushing Bank and Northfield Bank joined the mix in 2012. The avenue has achieved global recognition, especially among Israeli expatriates and tourists. In 1987, The Park House Hotel opened its doors between 12th and 13th avenues on 48th Street as the first kosher Hotel in Borough Park. In 1999 a 52-room luxury kosher hotel, the Avenue Plaza Hotel, opened on 13th Avenue, becoming the first hotel to appear in the neighborhood in more than a decade. These hotels along with many area merchants specifically accommodate the needs of visiting Hasidic tourists. Description Amnon's Kosher Pizza and Falafel store In Borough Park, 13th Avenue is primarily zoned as either a commercial district, or a residential district with commercial shops on the first floor. A The New York Times reporter compared the stretch of 13th Avenue in Borough Park to the Lower East Side at the beginning of the 20th century, where Orthodox Jews could buy anything they needed. The huge selection on 13th Avenue includes religious items, silver Judaica, Jewish books, electronics, modest clothing for men and women, children's clothes, wig stores, kosher meat markets, kosher bakeries, and kosher candy stores. All kinds of ethnic and modern Jewish dining establishments abound, including restaurants, cafes, delis and pizza stores, all with strict rabbinic supervision. Specialty clothing satisfying the different minhagim (customs) of the various Hasidic sects in the neighborhood is readily available. Thirteenth Avenue is known as the \\"Avenue of Values\\". In the days preceding major Jewish holidays, 13th Avenue is also filled with sidewalk vendors selling holiday needs.(subscription) The sidewalks and street are often congested, and parking is at a premium. Locals and tourists flood the avenue on Sundays and the eves of Jewish holidays. In 1989 the two-way avenue was converted to one-way in an effort to reduce congestion, but the traffic remains heavy.. Children and strollers are seen everywhere, as the Haredi Jewish residents with typically large families shop for their needs. Borough Park is considered a low-crime neighborhood, and parents often leave their babies unattended in strollers outside stores and restaurants. Notwithstanding the weekday hustle and bustle, shops close and cars disappear on the Jewish Sabbath and Jewish holidays. The handful of chain stores, such as Rite Aid, Duane Reade and The Children's Place, also close on the Jewish Sabbath and Jewish holidays. On these days, Hasidim garbed in their holiday finery traverse the avenue to attend morning synagogue services, and couples stroll with their baby carriages in the afternoon. Since 1999, 13th Avenue has been the site for a nightly Simchat Beit HaShoeivah musical performance during the intermediate days of Sukkot, organized by Chabad Rabbi Aaron Ginsburg. Raoul Wallenberg Way On December 9, 2012, the first day of Hanukkah, the stretch of 13th Avenue between 36th and 60th streets was co- named Raoul Wallenberg Way in honor of the Swedish diplomat who saved 100,000 Hungarian Jews during the Holocaust. Legislation for the renaming was submitted by New York City Councilmen David G. Greenfield and Brad Lander in conjunction with the Raoul Wallenberg Centennial Celebration Commission. Hundreds of people attended the naming ceremony. According to speakers at the event, many of the individuals rescued by Wallenberg immigrated to Borough Park to establish their families. The neighborhood is home to the largest concentration of Holocaust survivors in the United States. Dyker Heights section In Dyker Heights, 13th Avenue is zoned mostly for low-density residential townhouses, with shops on the first floors of some buildings. It is a two-way street with one lane in each direction, and ends at Dyker Beach Park and Golf Course at 86th Street. Transportation 55th Street station The B16 route of New York City Bus services the avenue in the southbound direction from 37th Street to 57th Street. (Northbound buses run on 14th Avenue from 56th to 36th Streets.) Also, the B64 bus runs on 13th Avenue in both directions between Bay Ridge Avenue and 86th Street. The New York City Subway's 55th Street station () lies above 13th Avenue. Additionally, the 13th Avenue station of the BMT Culver Line used to be over the avenue at 37th Street until it was demolished in 1975. Private intercity bus lines serving the Hasidic community leave from 49th Street; these include buses to Williamsburg, Monroe, and Monsey.

They have original jurisdiction in civil cases with any amount in controversy; felony criminal cases, domestic relations, family law, and cases involving minors cases (including adoption, dependency, juvenile delinquency, and probate cases). Judicial Personnel and Structure Judicial magistrates primarily serve their home county and have jurisdiction over simple misdemeanors, local infractions, and small claims. They have authority to order warrants, conduct preliminary hearings, and hear other simple issues. Most magistrates are attorneys, though it is not mandated by law. They serve four-year terms and are appointed by county commissions. Associate juvenile judges only have jurisdiction over juvenile court matters. They are able to issue orders, make findings, and official decisions in juvenile cases, juvenile delinquency cases, adoption, and parental rights issues. They serve six-year terms, and are appointed by district judges for the judicial district after being selected by a county commission. Associate probate judges have limited jurisdiction to probate cases. They are able to audit accounts, and perform other duties as ordered by the chief judge over the course of their six-year terms. They are appointed by the district court judge after having been selected by a county commission. District associate judges have the same jurisdiction as judicial magistrates, with additional authority to hear more serious misdemeanors, civil suits up to $10,000, and certain juvenile cases. District associate judges are appointed by the district judge after having been selected by a county commission for a six-year term. District judges have the authority to hear any case within the district. Felony criminal cases, adoptions, state administration issues, and many other matters come before these judges. These judges are appointed by the governor, from a list of nominees from a state nominating commission. The term for a district judge is six years. Each county has a clerk of the district court who manages and maintains all trial records in the county. Court attendants facilitate court proceedings, and aid with clerical work. Court reporters transcribe all official statements in the courtroom, making the court record. Juvenile court officers work with youth who are accused of delinquent acts, to oversee the treatment and restitution of the young person in question.Description of the Iowa Court System Regions of Jurisdiction There are 8 judicial districts, each encompassing five or more of Iowa's 99 counties.

Its extremely original and complex music, surreal and cynical lyrics, has been ahead of most of its Italian contemporaries and its quality was noted abroad, notably by John Peel, who often broadcast them during his shows for BBC. History Splatterpink was formed in 1990 by Diego D'Agata (bass guitar and lead singer), Metello Orsini (guitar) and Alistair Brison (drums). The trio expressed themselves with a raw, aggressive form of music, which characterized their first demo, \\"One\\". However, their lineup would endure many changes before the band achieved its definitive sound. After Brison returned to his native Scotland, the band went through several drummers until Alberto Melega took the job on a temporary basis. Guitarist Alessandro Cavazza (Orange) took Orsini's place for a short while, after which he was succeeded by Federico Bernardi. The introduction of baritone player Alessandro Meroli prompted a more experimental approach, which resulted in drummer Leonardo Saracino taking over for Melega. In 1995, the band recorded their debut album, \\"Industrie Jazzcore\\". Soon after its release, Splatterpink won first prize in a national competition called \\"Omaggio a Demetrio Stratos\\". Two years later, the band (which had been touring for almost three years) went on to record 1997's \\"Nutrimi\\" for Italian label Underground Records. The album received very positive reviews from fans and critics alike. Splatterpink proceeded to play many gigs all over Italy, and became widely recognized as an Italian pioneer of \\"jazzcore\\". During this time, British radio personality John Peel sent the band a very kind and heartfelt letter, which informed them that both of their albums were on the BBC's playlist. Soon after, Splatterpink performed at the Biennale of Young Artists in Turin, and began opening for bigger acts such as Ozric Tentacles, Nomeansno, P.J.Harvey, and Asian Dub Foundation. In 1999, new member Christian Rovatti took over on drums. However, his collaboration with the band was not successful. This compelled the other members to use a drum machine for several important gigs, which included an event in Mostar (Bosnia), where Splatterpink represented Italy's underground music scene. The band released its third album‚Äîentitled \\"#3\\"‚Äîin 2001. However, many fans and critics felt that it didn't compare to previous albums. Additionally, Splatterpink was finding it difficult to see live gigs y 2003 the group is disbanded. In 2012 the four musicians decide to get back together, pushed by a strong fans base reputation and to explore new boundaries with the latest formation which include the great drummer Ivano Zanotti. They released an EP on 2014, April and the new album work \\"Mongoflashmob\\"was released for Locomotiv Records on December 1, 2014.

Commissioned by Dr Samuel Walker, Rector of St Columb, following speculation that the proposed Cornish bishopric would be based at St Columb. It was built in 1851, on the site of a 14th-century moated medieval house. It is an asymmetrical plan rectory in a Gothic revival style. Over the years it has undergone a range of alterations. After undergoing several uses in the past it is currently privately owned and unoccupied. In 2011 it was listed by The Victorian Society as one Britain's most endangered buildings. After years of inaction by Cornwall Council the Victorian Society launched a petition in 2015 to save the building. Photos in 2015 show the shocking state of neglect and water damage to the building.

It is at least 2,900 parsecs away, more than twice the distance of NGC 2301 HD 50064 has variously been assigned spectral types of B6, B9, and B1, and is readily seen to have a bright supergiant luminosity class. It also shows HŒ± emission lines with P Cygni profiles, indicating mass loss through a powerful stellar wind. HD 50064 shows small-amplitude semi- regular pulsations. One strong period of 37 days has been interpreted as a strange mode oscillation and used to calculate the physical structure of the star. A luminosity of approximately 1,260,000 times that of the Sun -placing it among the brightest stars of the Milky Way-, a radius 200 times that of the Sun, and a mass 45 times larguer than the Sun, are derived. The pulsations and its spectrum are similar to those of Luminous blue variables (LBVs). The moderate mass loss suggests that it is an LBV caught pulsating and creating a circumstellar shell.

Originating in the high medieval period (late 11th to early 12th century), the type was frequently used throughout the 13th to 14th centuries. Continued use into the 15th and 16th centuries was mostly limited to high nobility, especially royalty, while lower nobility switched to the use of simple heraldic seals. Early examples (before 1170) Early examples of equestrian seals are known from second half of the 11th century. The oldest example that may be addressed as an \\"equestrian seal\\" is that of William I of England (c. 1067).\\"the very first equestrian seal on record is that of William the Conqueror. The double-sided seal die adopted by the Conqueror after Hastings is a celebrated though not fully understood artefact. [...] The great novelty is the equestrian obverse, which depicts William as duke of Normandy [...]. It shows a man wearing a helmet or crown, mounted on a gallopping horse, and holding a shield and banner with three streamers. This image may seem banal, but it is not, for it was completely new in the 1060s. Indeed, I think William was the inventor of the equestrian princely seal.\\" Jean-Fran√ßois Nieus, \\"Early Aristocratic Seals: An Anglo-Norman Success Story\\" in: Van Houts (ed.), Anglo-Norman Studies XXXVIII: Proceedings of the Battle Conference 2015 (2016), p. 101 Among the oldest extant examples in Germany is the seal of Henry of Laach (c. 1090). The horseman is characterized by the kite shield and a conical helmet, often bearing a banner. This type is continued into the mid-12th century, and late examples of kite shields are found into the 1160s.

Seals of the 1170s to 1190s show shield shapes transitional between the \\"kite\\" and the \\"heater\\" type. Helmet shapes become less conical and more rounded. The horseman is now shown as the prototypical \\"knight\\" with a heraldic shield. From about the 1230s, the horse is increasingly shown as wearing a heraldic caparison, and the rider as wearing a great helm. Around the middle of the 13th century, there was a fashion to also represent ladies and ecclesiastics on horseback on their seal, not wearing armour, but, as in the cases of Joan, Countess of Flanders (c. 1240), Maria of Brabant, Duchess of Bavaria (c. 1250) and Adelaide of Burgundy, Duchess of Brabant (c. 1260) practicing falconry.

Representations in seals of the 14th century show the nobleman with full heraldic achievements, often carrying a heraldic flag, or with a lance in full jousting armour.

Depictions of monarchs in full armour, crested helmets, with lances or heraldic flags etc. fell out of use with the end of the joust in the early 17th century. Frederick the Great of Prussia used a Majest√§tssiegel which depicted him on horseback in 1772 (albeit no longer depicted as a fully armored knight but as a military commander).Geheimes Staatsarchiv Preu√üischer Kulturbesitz (gsta.spk-berlin.de) The reverse of the Great Seal of Charles I of England (1627) shows the monarch in full gallop, wearing a fanciful classicist armour, accompanied by a hunting dog. The British monarchs from 1707 onward continued the convention of depicting the seated and crowned monarch on the obverse, and the monarch on horseback on the reverse. This is the case also for the queen regnants (Great Seal of Queen Anne, Queen Victoria, Elizabeth II), who are depicted in sidesaddle. In 1976, Austria minted a commemorative gold coin (13.5g 90% Au) on the occasion of the millennial anniversary of the Babenberg dynasty (Leopold I, Margrave of Austria), known as the Babenberger-Bundesgoldm√ºnze. The obverse of this coin was designed in the style of a medieval equestrian seal (with the addition of an alpine panorama). Modern heraldic forms In heraldic art, influenced by the equestrian seals, horsemen are a fairly common symbol. Two widely popular forms that the horseman takes is as the Pahonia and Saint George fighting the dragon. While these symbols are used in various coats of arms, they are arguably most famous as the Coat of arms of Lithuania and the Coat of arms of Moscow respectively.

Native Americans held council under it,Reutter, Harold. \\"Monument rededicated 100 years later\\". Grand Island Independent. 2011-07-07. Retrieved 2012-12-28. early pioneers used it as a landmark, and it was the first official name of the county seat of Merrick county. It is marked as a historical location by the Nebraska State Historical Society. History Lone Tree was a solitary cottonwood tree, which stood on the north side of the Platte River about three miles southwest of where Central City is located. The trunk of the tree was about in circumference at the base and was about tall. It was a landmark, it was claimed, which could be seen for across the prairie by early travelers. Native Americans knew the tree and named it (though the name is not known) before the pioneers came. Legend has it that Native American chiefs held council under its shade. It was a landmark for pioneers as early as 1833. In 1858, it was selected by Western Stage Co. as the site for the Lone Tree Station. From 1860 to 1861, the Western Stage Company station was built and operating. The huge cottonwood tree marked its location, which was operated by Mary Hilton from 1860 to 1861. In 1858, the Nebraska Territorial Legislature established Merrick County and designated \\"Elvira\\" as its mythical county seat located under Lone Tree near present day Central City. 1865 storm Lone Tree Landmark: Nebraska State Historical Society, Marker 92 In 1865, a great storm blew the tree over. The tree had died in 1863 and this was thought the consequence of two factors. First, as pioneers passed along the Overland Trail and Mormon Trail, they made carvings in its bark, thereby gradually destroying it. Second, pioneers often built campfires at the base of the tree, which may have further weakened it. Part of its trunk was taken to Lone Tree station (which later became Central City) and placed on the depot platform. Over time, fragments of it were carried away by tourists until it disappeared. Lone Tree (Central City) In 1866, the mythical Merrick county seat of Elvira was given an actual location in a town called \\"Lone Tree,\\" which, in 1875, would be renamed \\"Central City.\\" 1911 monument Although the original Lone Tree had long disappeared, the people of Merrick county had not forgotten its historical significance. In 1911, they erected a granite monument. Thirty years later, another cottonwood tree was planted at the original tree's location next to the granite monument. In 1911, there were also two dedications of the monument, one on August 9, 1911 and a second rededication of it on July 3, 2011.

During the reign of Emperor Wu, the Han forces launched a punitive campaign against Nanyue and conquered it in 111 BC. Background To the regions south of China, Zhao Tuo had established himself as the King of Nanyue.. Zhao was a Qin dynasty military officer from Zhending in northern China.. The Han frontier in the south was not threatened and there was no indication that Zhao Tuo would encroach on Han territory. In 196 BC, Emperor Gaozu sent Lu Jia on a diplomatic mission to Nanyue to officially recognize Zhao Tuo. Nevertheless, relations between Han and Nanyue were sometimes strained. Zhao Tuo resented Empress L√º's ban on exports of metal wares and female livestock to Nanyue. In 183 BC, he proclaimed himself the \\"Martial Emperor of the South\\" (ÂçóÊ≠¶Â∏ù), which implied a perceived status on equal footing with the Han emperor. Two years later, Nanyue attacked the Changsha Kingdom, a constituent kingdom of the Han empire.. In 180 BC, Lu Jia led a diplomatic mission to Nanyue. During negotiations, he succeeded in convincing Zhao Tuo to give up on his title as emperor and pay homage to Han as a nominal vassal.. Jade burial suit of King Zhao Mo In 135 BC, King Zhao Mo of Nanyue appealed to the Han court for help against attacking Minyue forces. The Han court responded swiftly and this led to Zhao Mo's agreement to send his son, Prince Zhao Yingqi, to serve in the palace at Chang'an. Even though Nanyue neglected to pay regular homage to the Han court, the court had its attention focused on other commitments and was not set on forcing the issue. At the Nanyue court in 113 BC, the Queen Dowager of Nanyue suggested incorporating Nanyue as a kingdom under the suzerainty of the Han empire, thus formally integrating the kingdom on the same terms as the other kingdoms of the Han empire. She was Chinese herself and was married to Zhao Yingqi. However, many Nanyue ministers opposed this suggestion.. L√º Jia was the primary Nanyue official to oppose the idea and he led the opposition against the Queen Dowager. In 112 BC, the opposition retaliated violently and executed the Queen Dowager, a provocation that led to the mobilization of a large Han naval force into Nanyue. Course The Han forces comprised six armies, who traveled by sea, directly southward, or from Sichuan along the Xi River.. In 111 BC, General Lu Bode and General Yang Pu advanced towards Panyu (present-day Guangzhou). This resulted in the surrender of Nanyue to the Han empire later that year. Aftermath After the conquest of Nanyue in 111 BC, the Han empire established nine new commanderies to administer the former Nanyue territories.. Han control proceeded to expand further southwestward by military means after the conquest.. Following the conquest, the Han empire gradually extended its overseas trade with the various countries in Southeast Asia and around the Indian Ocean..
