His racing career consisted of a single season, 1826, during which he ran eight times. After finishing unplaced on his racecourse debut, Lap-dog won his next four races including The Derby. He was retired to stud at the end of the year, but had little success as a sire of winners in England and was later exported to the United States. His name appeared in variations including Lapdog, Lap Dog and The Lap Dog. Background Lap-dog was a small bay horse with no white markings, bred by his owner George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont at his stud at Petworth. He was sired by Whalebone out of Egremont's unnamed Canopus mare making him a full brother to the 1831 Derby winner Spaniel. In addition to the two Derby winners, the Canopus mare also produced Fanchon, the dam of the 1000 Guineas winner Cara. Lap-dog's sire, Whalebone won the 1810 Derby and thirteen other races before becoming a successful and important stallion. He was British Champion sire in 1826 and 1827 and through his son Sir Hercules, is the male-line ancestor of most modern Thoroughbreds. Racing career =1826: three-year-old season= Lord Egremont On Wednesday 12 April, Lap- dog made his first appearance by running in a ¬£50 subscription plate for two-, three- and four-year-olds at the Newmarket Craven meeting. He finished unplaced behind the odds-on favourite Muleteer. For this race, Lap-dog was technically a two-year-old as racehorses in England had their official \\"birthdays\\" on 1 May: the modern practice of calculating horses' ages from 1 January was not introduced until 1834, and did not become generally accepted until the late 1850s. On Tuesday 9 May at the Second Spring meeting at Newmarket Lap-dog recorded his first win in a ¬£50 pound race for three-year- olds. He started at odds of 12/1 in a field of eleven runners and won from Lord Exeter's colt Recruit, with the favourite, Lamplighter running unplaced. In both these races his owner is recorded as being \\"Mr. Wyndham\\". At Epsom on 25 May, Lap-dog started at odds of 50/1 for the Derby with John Forth's colt Premier being made the 5/2 favourite. The field of nineteen runners was the largest assembled for the race up to that time. Ridden by George Dockeray, he won from the previously unraced Shakespeare. The runner-up, who made most of the early running appeared to have been given a poor ride by his inexperienced jockey and was considered an unlucky loser. Lap-dog was his owner's fifth Derby winner, establishing a record that was not equalled until Tulyar gave Aga Khan III his fifth winner in 1952. On his first race after his Derby win, Lap-dog appeared in the Scrub Sweepstakes at Brighton on 31 July and won from two opponents to whom he was conceding seven pounds. Two days later he was entered in a Sweepstakes for three-year-olds at Lewes Racecourse. He was allowed to walk over for the prize money, when the other three horses who had been entered for the race were withdrawn by their owners. The day's \\"racing\\" was a poor one: two of the three scheduled races were walkovers and the third was abandoned \\"for want of horses\\". Lap-dog returned to Newmarket in autumn and finished second to Dervise when 8/13 favourite for the Town Plate on 4 October. At the next Newmarket meeting on 16 October he reversed the form to beat Dervise in a subscription race, but both were easily beaten by Lamplighter. The race was described by the Sporting Magazine as \\"bringing together the most prominent characters of their class\\" and as confirming Lamplighter as the best colt in the south of England. Lap-dog's final race was a ¬£50 race for three-year-olds at the Newmarket Houghton meeting on 1 November. He finished third of the ten runners behind Shakespeare and Hobgoblin. The result strengthened the views of those who believed that Lap- dog had been lucky to beat Shakespeare at Epsom. Stud career Lap-dog was retired to stud for the 1827 season and was based at Mr Day's stables at Houghton Down, near Stockbridge, Hampshire. His stud fee for 1828 was ¬£7 for Thoroughbred mares, with five-shillings for the groom. His advertisement in the Racing Calendar described him as \\"decidedly the best horse of his year\\" and a \\"sure foal-getter\\". Despite these qualities, he made no real impact as a stallion. He was sold to the American breeder James Jackson and exported to stand as a stallion in Tennessee in 1835. Lap-dog died in Lincoln County, Tennessee in 1838. Pedigree * Lap-dog was inbred 4x4 to Woodpecker, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree. His dam, the Canopus mare was inbred 3x3x4 to this horse.

It features a boy named Jack Gantos and is based in the author's hometown, Norvelt, Pennsylvania. According to one reviewer, the \\"real hero\\" is \\"his home town and its values\\", a \\"defiantly political\\" message. The American Library Association awarded Gantos and Dead End the 2012 Newbery Medal, honoring the book as the year's \\"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\\". It also won the annual Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction. In Britain, where it was published by the Transworld Publishers imprint Corgi Books, it was one of eight books on the longlist for the annual Guardian Children's Fiction Prize. Newbery medal judges called the book \\"achingly funny\\" and one British reviewer called it \\"rib-splitting\\". Plot Dead End in Norvelt takes place during the summer of 1962, after the American schoolboy Jack Gantos fires his father's war trophy, a Japanese sniper rifle, at a war movie playing at a drive-in movie theater thinking it is unloaded. however, a bullet somehow flies out, causing a nosebleed. As punishment, he must stay in the house except as sent by his mother to help their elderly neighbor Miss Volker whom, upon Jack's arrival, boils her hands in water and bites off the blisters, which results in Jack getting a nosebleed. Miss Volker is the town's medical examiner and a former nurse. Miss Volker also writes obituaries for the town newspaper. She notices that elderly, \\"original Norvelters\\" are dying away mysteriously. Later, a Hells Angel gang member is hit by a cement truck near the Norvelt pants factory after crazily dancing a three-mile stretch from a Mt. Pleasant bar. This ends up causing the rest of the Hells Angel gang to cause mayhem in the town, lighting unoccupied houses on fire and stealing the most expensive casket from Mr. Huffer's funeral parlor for their fallen brother. Later, Jack's dad acquires a Piper J-3 Cub, and assigns Jack to dig an underground bomb shelter as his dad builds a runway for the plane. Around this time, Jack has a red Plymouth Valiant promised to him from Miss Volker as a birthday present after he had been driving it as Miss Volker's chauffeur. As Jack thinks about the strange rate of deaths in original Norvelters, he realizes that thin mint Girl Scout cookies given out to the original Norvelters through the Community Center may have something to do with it because many of those people rely on it, along with his mom's homemade casseroles, for food. Soon, Miss Volker is placed under house arrest when the police find chocolates, gifted to her by her one-way lover Mr. Spizz, poisoned with 1080 (to kill rodents) in her basement and accuse her of feeding them to the old Norvelters. Later, Jack gets a call from Mr. Spizz, who was supervising Miss Volkers house arrest, to come down to her house. When Jack gets there, Miss Volker says that Mr. Spizz had admitted to secretly poisoning the Original Norvelters to try to get her to marry him, and that he had stolen Jack's car to get a six-hour headstart on the county police. The book concludes with Jack being picked up in his dad's J-3 and doing some \\"bombing runs\\" with paint-filled balloons on the Viking drive-in theater, during which he decides it isn't that fun and asks to be let down back on the ball field. Finally, an inset paragraph (styled after the \\"In this day in history\\" section that Miss Volker employed Jack to type along with the obits in the Norvelt news) talks about Jack being ungrounded. Themes In the book Dead End On Norvelt, people use power to control others. The Newbery Medal judges, who are American children's librarians, cited the importance of history and reading. The Guardian Prize judges, who are British children's novelists, cited \\"self- sufficiency, community, and neighbourliness\\". One reviewer of Dead End in Norvelt, children's writer Josh Lacey, called it \\"defiantly political\\"; one of its messages is \\"don't forget the narratives of American life that have been neglected or deliberately buried by the dominant culture.\\" \\"[T]he real hero of the novel isn't Jack himself, but his home town and its values. Norvelt was a New Deal town built by the US government to house poor families and named after Eleanor Roosevelt, described by Miss Volker as 'the greatest American woman who has ever lived'.\\" Level Another Irish reviewer suggested that \\"every Elder will be able to relate to Jack's character\\" and recommended the book for readers age 9 to 13. The Guardian Prize judges recommended it for ages 12 and up.

The type and only described species is N. tuberculatus, which existed in what is now Slovakia during the Miocene epoch, and was described by Charlie J. Underwood and Jan Schlogl in 2011. It was described from 28 fossilized teeth. Taxonomy Nanocetorhinus was described by Underwood and Schlogl in 2011, from 28 partial and complete fossil teeth (holotype: Z 27485) discovered in the Laksarska Nova Ves Formation at Cerov√°-Lieskov√©, Vienna Basin, in Slovakia. It was placed incertae sedis into the chondrichthyan subclass Neoselachii. The authors expressed an uncertainty with regards to the validity of the genus being assigned to this subclass, as the teeth from which it was described bore minimal resemblance to those of previously known neoselachian genera. =Etymology= The generic name combines the Latin term \\"nano\\" (\\"dwarvish\\") with \\"Cetorhinus\\" (the generic name of the basking shark), and references the resemblance the teeth of Nanocetorhinus bear to those of Cetorhinus, but on a smaller scale. The species epithet refers to the tuberculate surface ornament of the teeth. Description Underwood and Schlogl theorized that Nanocetorhinus was a planktivorous shark, similarly to its namesake, although there is no consequential evidence that the two genera are closely related. The teeth were little more than 1 mm long at the largest. The authors described the form of the teeth as \\"simple and rather irregular\\", and mentioned a lack of wear on the cutting edges, indicating that they were not used to grab and puncture meat, but rather played a minimal role in the process of food consumption. They also noted that the irregular form was more consistent with those of planktivorous sharks.

The book tells the story of a dog named Daisy, who has a beloved ball destroyed and then replaced. Raschka won the 2012 Caldecott Medal for his illustrations in the book. The creation of the book took years but was praised for its ability to evoke emotion in the reader.  Background and publication  Author and illustrator Chris Raschka first thought about the idea for A Ball for Daisy 10 years before writing it, after seeing how upset his son got after he lost a ball thanks to a dog. Prior to creating the book he sketched various combinations of balls and dogs. Raschka described the process of creating the book as a difficult one. He had wanted to write a wordless picture book so that \\"a child could read the book without knowing how to read. The challenge lay in conveying the emotions the way he wanted to, but without any words. The book was published May 10, 2011 and was followed by a sequel, Daisy Gets Lost, in 2013.  Plot  A Ball for Daisy is a wordless children's picture book that tells the story of a small white dog named Daisy and her favorite red ball. Daisy is so obsessed with the ball that she takes it everywhere with her, sleeps with it, and overall has to be near it constantly. As her owner takes Daisy out for a walk one day, her ball gets snatched by a brown dog wanting to play. Daisy tries her hardest to get the ball back, but the other dog insists on playing with it and accidentally pops it. Daisy's owner then throws the ball in the trash and takes Daisy home. For a while, Daisy acts distraught over her loss. Later, Daisy's owner takes her for another walk, and on the walk they see the same dog that popped Daisy's ball, but this time that dog has a shiny new blue ball. The other dog gives the blue ball to Daisy, which makes her very happy.  Writing and illustrations  The story centers on an idea and theme that is relatable to for children and could help build emotional resiliency.Marcus, L. S. (2012). Chris Raschka Unleashed. Horn Book Magazine, 88(4), 32‚Äì35. Retrieved from ebscohost. Many reviewers commented on Raschka's strength in depicting emotions so well. He uses colors to help depict the changing moods in the story. Raschka illustrated the book using watercolors. Several reviewers also commented on Raschka's skill with broad brushstrokes. The illustrations give the appearance of having been drawn without revision and combine watercolor and comic book drawing techniques. Its Caldecott win was part of a trend of wordless picture books being honored, which began with David Wiesner's honor book Free Fall and part of Rashka's ability to \\"take risks\\" with each of his books.  Reception and awards  The book was well reviewed, gaining starred reviews from The Horn Book Magazine,HORNING, K. T. (2011). A Ball for Daisy. Horn Book Magazine, 87(5), 77. Retrieved from ebscohost. which praised the book as \\"noteworthy for both its artistry and its child appeal\\"; Kirkus Reviews, which wrote of how \\"rarely, perhaps never, has so steep an emotional arc been drawn with such utter, winning simplicity\\"; and School Library Journal, which noted how it matched the illustrator's other work, \\"Raschka continues to experiment with what is essential to express the daily joys and tribulations of humans and animals.\\" The book was a The New York Times Best Seller and was named by it as one of the best books of 2011. The book was awarded the 2012 Caldecott award. \\"Chris Raschka‚Äôs deceptively simple paintings of watercolor, gouache and ink explore universal themes of love and loss that permit thousands of possible variants\\", said Caldecott Medal Committee Chair Steven L. Herb. The Wall Street Journal agreed with its choice as a Caldecott Medal recipient.

Land Area Chicago Wilderness stretches from southwest Michigan, to northwest Indiana, reaching through northern Illinois, and southern Wisconsin. It is home to a variety of ecosystems sustaining life to thousands of native plants and animal species, including almost 200 listed endangered or threatened species in Illinois. The various ecological communities contain: prairies, woodlands, including savannas, open woodlands, flatwoods and forests, wetlands, which encompass marshes, sedge meadows, bogs, seeps, springs and swamps, rivers and lakes. The Four Main Initiatives Chicago Wilderness has four major initiatives it strives to improve through its presence: Climate Change, Green Infrastructure Vision: Bringing Nature to People, Leave No Child Inside, and Restoring the Health of Local Nature. Included in these core projects, the Chicago Wilderness alliance encompasses a variety of other programs to benefit the members of the community as well as the land they are preserving. =Climate Change= The climate change initiative of Chicago Wilderness focuses primarily on addressing the effects of climate change on the Chicago wilderness region and ways to respond to these changes. Studies have shown the impact of climate change has on the world, but little is known about how it affects specific regions. Recently, both Chicago Wilderness and the Nature Conservancy published reports to address the issues the area faces as the climate changes, both from the perspective of the city and the region's wildlife.April, Kelly. \\"Conservationists around Great Lakes Plan for Climate Change - Chicago Tribune.\\" Featured Articles From The Chicago Tribune. 28 Aug. 2011.

In addition to the reports, the Chicago Wilderness Alliance also developed the Climate Action Plan for Nature, which has established plans for the city of Chicago (Chicago Climate Action Plan), the city of Evanston, and the University of Illinois. The Climate Action Plan has five strategies it is currently working on: Energy efficient buildings, clean and renewable energy sources, improved transportation options, reduce waste and industrial pollution, and finally adaption. Green-covered roofs on some of Chicago's buildings are key features of projects implemented as part of their climate action plan.\\"Cities and Climate Change: Greening the Concrete Jungle  The Economist.\\" The Economist - World News, Politics, Economics, Business & Finance.

Chicago wilderness works to put the green infrastructure vision into action by focusing on four main scales: Regional, Community, Neighborhood and Site. At a regional level, CW members work with regional agencies. By looking at future plans and policies, they can focus on including conservation developmental and preservation principles that promote and sustain community health. In the community, land use ordinances and plans will be reworked to enhance people friendly design, while integrating such principles as sustainability, biodiversity and conservation. GIV works at a neighborhood level to further promotion of conservation, preservation and access to nature in communities. At a more specific level, they work with specific sites to encourage use of rain gardens, rain barrels (also known as rainwater tanks), and natural landscaping in open spaces in the community.\\"Green Infrastructure Vision: Bringing Nature to People.\\" Chicago Wilderness.

According to Popular Mechanics magazine, Bitcasa uses a convergent encryption method whereby a client's data is assigned an anonymous identifier before it is uploaded. If that data already exists on the Bitcasa servers (such as a popular song), it is not uploaded but is instead earmarked as available for download by that client. This protocol is said to reduce upload time. Bitcasa's encryption method reportedly cloaks the data while it is still on the client's computer and then blocks of data are sent by an enterprise-grade AES-256 encryption method to the data cloud for storage.TechCrunch talks to Bitcasa CEO about encryption TechCrunch September 2011 According to ExtremeTech, this service gives users access and ownership rights to their own data. In a review by Gizmodo of Australia, Bitcasa's cloud service was described as a \\"winner\\" that is \\"pricier than its competitors\\" but supported by Mac, PC and Android platforms. =Mobile= Users could access their Infinite Drive through mobile apps for Android, Windows RT, and browsers and support offline viewing of files. The app collects and displays individual media types such as photos, video, music, and documents, independently of the folder hierarchy that they are stored in.

Files of any size can be shared with a web link that can distributed via email, text or IM. After the initial server migration, only apps for Android, iOS and browsers were updated, effectively rendering other devices unusable with the service.

The company instead offered previous clients the same packages that regular users pay at $10/month for 1TB ($99 annually) or $99/month for 10TB ($999 annually). The company gave users 23 days to migrate or download their data, or it would be deleted. This move was criticized by many users as not being physically possible at the download rates provided by Bitcasa. As a result of a system migration, some users had data loss, some of which was not replaceable. Angry customers gave the company bad feedback, and the community forum became less active. The company has offered yearly subscribers the right to cancel and get a prorated refund. However, it disabled the ability to cancel accounts and refused to delete accounts through its support system.

It is mostly in Thailand, although a small section in the northeast is within Sainyabuli and Bokeo Provinces, Laos. In Thailand the range extends mainly across Chiang Rai, Phayao, Lampang, Phrae, Nan, Uttaradit and Sukhothai Provinces, reaching Tak Province at its southwestern end. The population density of the area is relatively low. Only two sizable towns, Phayao and Phrae, are within the area of the mountain system and both have fewer than 20,000 inhabitants each. Larger towns, like Chiang Rai and Uttaradit, are near the limits of the Phi Pan Nam Range, in the north and in the south respectively. Phahonyothin Road, part of the AH2 Highway system, crosses the Phi Pan Nam Range area from north to south, between Tak and Chiang Rai. There are two railway tunnels of the Northern Line across the Phi Pan Nam mountains. Both are on the south side of the range: the 130.2 m Huai Mae Lan Tunnel in Phrae Province and the 362.4 m Khao Phlueng Tunnel in Uttaradit and Phrae Provinces.Khao Phlueng Tunnel In the mountains north of Thoeng, at the northeast end of the range, Hmong people live in small villages such as Ban Saen Than Sai and Ban Phaya Phripak, the latter on top of a mountain pass. Geography The Phi Pan Nam Range is composed of many smaller mountain chains roughly aligned in a north-south direction in its northern part and, further south, in a northeast-southwest direction. These ranges cover an extensive area and are often separated by intermontane basins or lowlands. They end in the west with the Khun Tan Range, in the east with the Luang Prabang Range, and with the Central Plain of Siam in the south. The northern tip is bound by the Mekong River.Heritage Thailand, Geography 4 There are columnar basalt formations in Mon Hin Kong () in an area in the mountains near Na Phun, Wang Chin District, Phrae Province.‡∏°‡πà‡∏≠‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏≤‡∏´‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏û‡∏¥‡∏®‡∏ß‡∏á Wonderful Mountain Of Colunnar In Phae Mueang Phi there are mushroom rocks and other bizarre rock formations caused by erosion.‡πÅ‡∏û‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏ú‡∏µ ‡∏£‡∏π‡∏õ‡πÅ‡∏•‡∏∞‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏°‡∏π‡∏• ‡∏à.‡πÅ‡∏û‡∏£‡πà =Sub- ranges= The Phi Pan Nam range system is often divided in two physiographic longitudinal sections: * Western Phi Pan Nam Range (‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏ú‡∏µ‡∏õ‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏ï‡∏∞‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ï‡∏Å) or Phi Pan Nam Range proper, in the northwest between the Wang and Yom Rivers.Northern Thailand- Geography 3 Some scholarly works designate the Khun Tan Range as the \\"Western Phi Pan Nam Range\\" and this section therefore as the \\"Central Phi Pan Nam Range\\".Sarasawadee Ongsakul, The History of Lan Na * Eastern Phi Pan Nam Range (‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏ú‡∏µ‡∏õ‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏ï‡∏∞‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏≠‡∏≠‡∏Å), also known as \\"Phlueng Range\\" (‡∏ó‡∏¥‡∏ß‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏•‡∏∂‡∏á) in the southeast between the Yom and the Nan Rivers.

It is, however, significant from the hydrographic point of view. These mountains divide the Mekong from the Chao Phraya watershed and important rivers of Thailand have their source in the Phi Pan Nam area. Its name in Thai \\"‡∏ó‡∏¥‡∏ß‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏ú‡∏µ‡∏õ‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥\\" roughly means \\"the mountains of the spirits dividing the waters\\", 'spirits' (‡∏ú‡∏µ phi) here referring to ancient mountain deities of Thai folklore. Among the Thai rivers that originate in the Phi Pan Nam Mountains the main ones are the Wang and Yom River, with their tributaries such as the Ngao, flowing towards the Chao Phraya. The Ing and the Lao, a tributary of the Kok River, flow northwards and are part of the Mekong basin. A great number of smaller rivers have their sources in mountains across the range. The Sirikit Dam is at the southeastern edge of the Phi Pan Nam mountains. History There were formerly large teak forests in some areas of the range. However, at the beginning of the 20th century concessions were given to logging companies and the forest cover dwindled dramatically especially in lowland areas between ranges. Deforestation also has affected areas that were cleared for local agriculture. Often wildfires are deliberately set off by local farmers, as well as by speculators who hire people to set forests on fire in order to claim land title deeds for the areas that have become \\"degraded forest\\". Owing to the relative isolation of the area there was Communist insurgency in the mountainous forests of the Phi Pan Nam Range during the Cold War. A memorial was erected on 1,118 m high Doi Phaya Phipak (‡∏î‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏û‡∏ç‡∏≤‡∏û‡∏¥‡∏†‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏î‡∏¥‡πå) to commemorate the victims of the battles between troops of the Royal Thai Armed Forces and the insurgents of the Communist Party of Thailand between the 1950s and the 1970s.Doi Phaya Phipak There is now a historical site and a forest park at Doi Phaya Phipak, also known as Phaya Phipak. A controversial dam was planned in the central area of the range on the Yom River in Kaeng Suea Ten in 1991 but this project was later abandoned in the face of popular opposition.The Injustice Case of Kaeng Sua Ten Dam ProjectLocal Participation and the Kaeng Sua Ten Dam The debate about the dam, however, resumed in 2011.Bangkok Post - Floodgates reopen in dam debate Two smaller dams on the Yom River may be built instead of the Kaeng Suea Ten mega-dam. Ecology The Phu Chi Fa group Generally the forested areas of the Phi Pan Nam are known for their teak and bamboo forest. The mountain ranges are covered with tropical dry broadleaf forests, including sections of moist evergreen forest, mixed deciduous forest, dry deciduous forest, as well as hill evergreen forest at higher altitudes. There is great biodiversity in these mountains and their few unspoilt valleys, with a wide range of animal and plant species.Mae Yom on Northern Thailand National Parks The whole area of the range is part of the Central Indochina dry forests ecoregion.Central Indochina dry forests There are a number of protected areas in the Phi Pan Nam mountains, mostly encompassing mountainous terrain. These are patchily distributed across the range, and the largest national parks are in its central part, roughly around Phayao town. Protected sectors are typically surrounded by agricultural zones, often near roads and villages and thus with vast surfaces under the influence of the edge effect.Protected Planet - Mae Yom National Park Besides the national parks and wildlife reserves, there are the Huai Tak Teak Biosphere Reserve in Lampang ProvinceUNESCO - MAB Biosphere Reserves Directory - Huai Tak Teak Biosphere Reserve and the Phu Langka Forest Park,Tourism Thailand - Phu Langka Forest Park located in Chiang Kham District and Pong District of Phrae Province. The main attractions of the forest park are Doi Hua Ling, Doi Phu Lang Ka and Doi Phu Nom;Phu Langka Forest Park  Bangkok Post: Travel the latter is a breast- shaped hill rising in an area of grassland.Doi Phu Nom picture =Flora= Formerly there were large extensions of teak (Tectona grandis) forests in the range, including the highly appreciated golden teak variety. These forests are now much reduced. Forest fires are common during the dry season. Some of the other species of trees found in the forests of the mountains are: Afzelia xylocarpa, Ailanthus triphysa, Anisoptera costata, Artocarpus lacucha, Berrya ammonilla, Betula alnoides, Cinnamomum iners, Dalbergia oliveri, Dillenia pentagyna, Dipterocarpus obtusifolius, Dipterocarpus alatus, Dipterocarpus turbinatus, Duabanga grandiflora, Garcinia indica, Hopea odorata, Irvingia malayana, Lagerstroemia loudonii, Lagerstroemia calyculata, Lagerstroemia tomentosa, Lithocarpus densiflorus, Mangifera caloneura, Michelia champaca, Michelia floribunda, Pterocarpus macrocarpus, Schleichera oleosa, Terminalia bellirica, Toona ciliata, Vitex pinnata and Xylia xylocarpa.

There are also Asian elephants in their natural habitat in a few protected areas, such as in the Si Satchanalai National Park. Formerly there were also in the Wiang Ko Sai National Park but there have been no sightings in recent years. The green peafowl, now rare in the wilderness and threatened by habitat destruction throughout Southeast Asia, breeds in the central mountains of the range from January to March. Among the other animals, the Indian muntjac, Burmese hare, Indian hare, Indochinese flying squirrel, black giant squirrel, Java mouse-deer, jungle cat, mainland serow, masked palm civet, Asian palm civet, Malayan civet, bamboo rat and northern treeshrew, as well as the Bengal monitor deserve mention.TourismThailand.org - Doi Phu Nang National Park A variety of birds are found in the range such as the blue-winged siva, white- rumped shama, scaly-breasted munia, black bulbul, blue-throated barbet, pin- striped tit-babbler, blue-bearded bee-eater, crested kingfisher, sooty-headed bulbul, coppersmith barbet, great hornbill, chestnut-headed bee-eater and the red-billed blue magpie.Craig Robson, Birds of Thailand File:Pavo muticus - Hai Hong Karni.jpgThe endangered green peafowl.

Datta is a Wayne State University civil engineering professor and researcher who highly specializes in transportation engineering and safety. After receiving his early schooling, undergraduate degrees, and field experience in Calcutta, India, he moved to the United States to complete his master's and doctoral degrees. While in Detroit, MI, he worked for and later owned Goodell Grivas, Inc., a structural engineering consulting firm, and became a full-time faculty member at Wayne State University in 1973. His most notable contributions include work on the roof of Cobo Hall, in Detroit, MI, and the steel structural work done on Jacobs Field (now Progressive Field) in Cleveland, OH. Dr. Datta has also claimed to be the inventor of the double- drive thru at fast food establishments. Dr. Datta also founded the Transportation Research Group at Wayne State University; this group is composed of undergraduate and graduate students that complete transportation- related research grant projects for the State of Michigan.  Early life and education  Dr. Tapan Datta grew up in India as the youngest child out of four. His father was an electrical and mechanical engineer in India. He earned his diploma from South Calcutta National School in Calcutta, India, in 1955. In 1957, Dr. Datta graduated from Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College, then under the University of Calcutta, with a general two year math and science degree. He cites his reasoning for pursuing civil engineering, and later transportation engineering instead of mechanical or electrical engineering as, ‚Äúa want to do something different, so that my father could not oversee me all the time‚Äù. Dr. Datta also obtained an Urban Planning degree while studying in India, before applying to the Bengal Engineering College, Shibpur now named as IIEST, Shibpur, also in Calcutta, India. In order to gain admittance to the IIEST Shibpur, he had to compete with 40,000 applicants, of whom only 400 were admitted. Dr. Datta was originally disqualified for being, ‚Äútoo lean and thin...and underweight.‚Äù For the next four weeks, he did nothing but eat rice and sleep. Right before his next physical, he drank two gallons of water. He made the weight requirement by one pound, and was then admitted to the college to begin his civil engineering studies. By 1965, Dr. Datta had earned his B.E. in Civil Engineering and a Graduate Diploma in Town & Regional Planning from Bengal Engineering College. He then moved to Detroit to complete his Masters of Science in Civil Engineering from Wayne State University. He earned his Ph.D. in Civil Engineering with a focus in Transportation from Michigan State University in 1973.  Employment  In 1962, after getting his bachelors in math and science from Vivekananda College, Dr. Datta was employed by Kuljin, an American civil engineering company in India. While working for this company, he was faced with a very competitive work environment which fostered in him the feeling that he could do something though his experiences there. Working for Kuljin was also very important in his academic pursuits; in order to be accepted to the prestigious Bengal University's College of Engineering, experience in the field was required among many other rigorous tests. After a few years of working for Kuljin, Dr. Datta applied to Bengal University and was accepted. After acquiring his degree in Civil Engineering at the Bengal Engineering College of the University of Calcutta, he traveled to Detroit, Michigan, in 1967. While studying for his master's degree at Wayne State University, he worked in the Wayne State mailing room to support himself. He was eventually hired as a part-time professor at Wayne State. Dr. Datta was hired as a full-time faculty member in 1973 by Wayne State. While at Wayne State, Dr. Datta has worked on many research projects for MDOT, in addition to being a professor of Transportation Engineering. After his first year of employment, he received a grant to run safety training programs throughout the state. Dr. Datta then created the Transportation Research Group (TRG) at Wayne State and has led numerous grant projects through this group. Some projects the TRG completed in recent years include ‚Äú2005 and 2007 Child Restraint Device Use and Misuse Survey,‚Äù the ‚ÄúSusan Harwood Training Grant ‚Äì OSHA Training Material Development for Highway Construction Work Zones and Traffic Control Hazards,‚Äù and a study on the ‚ÄúIdentification of Targeted Enforcement Locations for the Reduction of Speed-Related Crashes‚Äù. Around the same time he was hired as a full-time faculty member at Wayne State, Dr. Datta also began working for Goodell Grivas Inc., a structural engineering consulting firm in Southfield, Michigan. This company was responsible for engineering the structural steel of Jacobs Field (now Progressive Field) as it was being constructed in Cleveland, OH, as well as the roof on Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan. In 1981, Dr. Datta became the sole owner of Goodell Grivas Inc after one of the existing owners died. Dr. Datta walked away from the company in the early 1990s to fully dedicate his time to research and teaching at Wayne State.  Achievements  In graduate school, Dr. Datta was a member of both Chi Epsilon, the National Civil Engineering Honor Society, and Tau Beta Pi, the National Engineering Honor Society. He earned the 1992 Michigan State Safety Commission Award for long-term contribution in Traffic Engineering and Safety. He received the 2000 ‚ÄúArthur Carr‚Äù Professorship Award from Wayne State University, the Wayne State University Safety Award for Service on the ‚ÄòDrive Safety to Wayne State‚Äô Campaign from WSU's Loss Prevention Committee for 2005, and the Engineering Excellence in Teaching Award for 2006 from The Wayne State University College of Engineering. Dr. Datta has earned numerous professional awards such as the Outstanding Individual Engineering Excellence Award in Engineering Education from the Michigan Society of Professional Engineers in 2007, and the Outstanding Contribution to Traffic Safety Award from the Governor's Traffic Safety Advisory Commission in 2007 for the ‚ÄòDrive Safely to Wayne State‚Äô Campaign. In 2009, at the annual Traffic Management and Work Zone Safety Conference in Orlando, FL, he was awarded the National Work Zone Safety Awareness Award for the FHWA-sponsored project ‚ÄúUtility Work Zone Traffic Control Guideline Development and Training\\". That same year, he also received the 2009 Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award, as well as Membership into the Hall of Fame at Wayne State University, College of Engineering. In March 2009, Governor Granholm and the State of Michigan appointed him to the ‚ÄúConstruction Safety Standards Commission‚Äù. As of 2019, Dr. Datta has retired from his teaching position at Wayne State University as well as his role in leading the Transportation Research Group.

He is remembered not only for ameliorating the working conditions of textile mill-hands in the 19th century but also for his courageous initiatives on caste and communal issues.. Apart from this he was also awarded the title of Rao Bahadur in 1895 for his work during riots between Hindus and Muslims. \\"Justice of peace\\" was awarded with great respect to him by the then British Indian Government. The Government of India issued a postage stamp with his photograph in 2005. Social contribution Narayan Meghaji Lokhande was a prominent colleague of Mahatma Jotirao Phule. He was born in a Mali family from Thane. He had been educated up to high school. He learned of the Satyashodhak movement early enough to become a member in its second year in 1874. Lokhande is acclaimed as the Father of the Trade Union Movement in India. From 1880 onwards he took over the management of Deenbandhu which was published from Mumbai. At this time he also quit his job as head clerk in a cotton mill in Mumbai and founded Millhands' Association, devoting himself fully to social service. Along with Lokhande, Phule also addressed the meetings of the textile workers in Bombay. It is significant that before Phule and his colleagues Krishnarao Bhalekar and Lokhande tried to organise the peasants and the workers, no such attempt was made by any organisation to redress their grievances. Lokhande started the first labour association in India ‚Äî 'Bombay Mill Hands Association'. Some of the rights mill workers got because of N M Lokhande were: * Mill workers should get a weekly holiday on Sunday. * In the afternoon, workers should be entitled to half-hour recess. * The mill should start working from 6:30 in the morning and close by sunset. * The salaries of the workers should be given by the 15th of every month.

The process involves the study of social technologies (practice methods, models, and theories), service technologies (programs, organizations, and systems), and scientific innovations designed to ameliorate problems and enhance the quality of life of individuals, families and communities to improve the delivery of service with better coordination, accessibility and accountability. The mission of human services is to promote a practice that involves simultaneously working at all levels of society (whole-person approach) in the process of promoting the autonomy of individuals or groups, making informal or formal human services systems more efficient and effective, and advocating for positive social change within society. Human services practitioners strive to advance the autonomy of service users through civic engagement, education, health promotion and social change at all levels of society. Practitioners also engage in advocating so human systems remain accessible, integrated, efficient and effective. Human services academic programs can be readily found in colleges and universities, which award degrees at the associate, baccalaureate, and graduate levels. Human services programs exist in countries all around the world. History =United States= Human services has its roots in charitable activities of religious and civic organizations that date back to the Colonial period. However, the academic discipline of human services did not start until the 1960s. At that time, a group of college academics started the new human services movement and began to promote the adoption of a new ideology about human service delivery and professionalism among traditional helping disciplines. The movement's major goal was to make service delivery more efficient, effective, and humane. The other goals dealt with the reeducation of traditional helping professionals (interprofessional education),jose A Hernandez to have a greater appreciation of the individual as a whole person (humanistic psychology) and to be accountable to the communities they serve (postmodernism). Furthermore, professionals would learn to take responsibility at all levels of government, use systems approaches to consider human problems improvements, and be involved in progressive social change. Traditional academic programs such as education, nursing, social work, law and medicine were resistant to the new human services movement's ideology because it appeared to challenge their professional status. Changing the traditional concept of professionalism involved rethinking consumer control and the distribution of power. The new movement also called on human service professionals to work for social change. It was proposed that the reduction of the monopolistic control of professionals could result individual of knowledge and would lead to professionals advocating on behalf of clients and communities against professional establishments. The movement also hoped that human service delivery systems would become integrated, comprehensive, and more accessible, which would make them more humane for service users. Ultimately, the resistance from traditional helping professions served as the impetus for a group of educators in higher education to start the new academic discipline of human services. Some maintain that the human services discipline has a concrete identity as a profession that supplements and complements other traditional professions. Yet other professionals and scholars have not agreed upon an authoritative definition for human services. Academic programs =United States= Development Chenault and Burnford argued that human services programs must educate and train students at the graduate or postgraduate level if human services hoped to be considered a proper professional discipline. A progressive graduate human services program was established by Audrey Cohen (1932‚Äì1996), who was considered an innovative educator for her time. The Audrey Cohen College of Human Services, now called the Metropolitan College of New York, offered one of the first graduate programs in 1974. In the same time period, Springfield College in Massachusetts became a major force in preserving human services as an academic discipline. Currently, Springfield College is one of the oldest and largest human services program in the United States. Manpower studies in the 1960s and 70s had shown that there would be a shortage of helping professionals in an array of service delivery areas.Cohen, 1969.Kadish, 1969. In turn, some educators proposed that the training of nonprofessionals (e.g., mental health technicians) could bridge this looming personnel shortage. One of the earliest educational initiatives to develop undergraduate curricula was undertaken by the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB), which was funded by the National Institute on Health. Professionals of the SREB Undergraduate Social Welfare Manpower Project helped colleges develop new social welfare programs, which later became known as human services. Some believed community college human services programs were the most expedient way to train paraprofessionals for direct service jobs in areas such as mental health. Currently, a large percentage of human services programs are run at the community college level. The development of community college human services programs was supported with government funding that was earmarked for the federal new careers initiatives. In turn, the federally funded New Careers Program was created to produce a nonprofessional career track for economically disadvantaged, underemployed, and unemployed adults as a strategy to eradicate poverty within societyGrosser, Henry, & Kelly, 1969.Haskell, 1969.Pearl & Riessman, 1965.Riessman & Popper, 1968. and to end a critical shortage of health-care personnel. Graduates from these programs successfully acquired employment as paraprofessionals, but there were limitations to their upward mobility within social service agencies because they lacked a graduate or professional degree. Current programs Currently, there are academic programs in human services at the associate, baccalaureate, and graduate levels. There are approximately 600 human services programs throughout the United States. An online directory of human services programs lists many (but not all) of the programs state by state in conjunction with their accreditation status from the Council for Standards in Human Services Education (CSHSE). The CSHSE offers accreditation for human services programs in higher education. The accreditation process is voluntary and labor-intensive; it is designed to assure the quality, consistency, and relevance of human service education through research-based standards and a peer-review process. According to the CSHSE's webpage there are only 43 accredited human services programs in the United States. The Standards for each level of degree accredited by CSHSE can be obtained by clicking on the following links: # National Standards for Associate Degree in Human Services # National Standards for a Baccalaureate Degree in Human Services # National Standards for a Masters Degree in Human Services Human services curricula are based on an interdisciplinary knowledge foundation that allows students to consider practical solutions from multiple disciplinary perspectives. Across the curriculum human services students are often taught to view human problems from a socioecological perspective (developed by Urie Bronfenbrenner) that involves viewing human strengths and problems as interconnected to a family unit, community, and society. This perspective is considered a \\"whole-person perspective\\". Overall, undergraduate programs prepare students to be human services generalists while master's programs prepare students to be human services administrators, and doctoral programs prepare students to be researcher-analysts and college-level educators. Research in this field focuses on an array of topics that deal with direct service issues, case management, organizational change, management of human service organizations, advocacy, community organizing, community development, social welfare policy, service integration, multiculturalism, integration of technology, poverty issues, social justice, development, and social change strategies. Certification and continuing education =United States= The Center for Credentialing & Education (CCE) conceptualized the Human Services-Board Certified Practitioner (HS-BCP) credential with the assistance of the National Organization for Human Services (NOHS) and the Council for Standards in Human Service Education (CSHSE). The credential was created for human services practitioners seeking to advance their careers by acquiring independent verification of their practical knowledge and educational background. Graduates from human services programs can obtain a Human Services Board Certified Practitioner (HS-BCP) credential offered by the Center for Credentialing & Education (CCE). The HS-BCP certification ensures that human services practitioners offer quality services, are competent service providers, are committed to high standards, and adhere to the NOHS Ethical Standards of Human Service Professionals, as well as to help solidify the professional identity of human services practitioners. HS-BCPE Experience Requirements for the certification: HS-BCP applicants must meet post- graduation experience requirements to be eligible to take the examination. However, graduates of a CSHSE accredited degree program may sit for the HS-BCP exam without verifying their human services work experience. Otherwise experience requirements for candidates not from a CSHSE accredited program are as follows: Associate degree with post degree experience requires three years, including a minimum of 4,500 hours; Bachelor's Degree with post degree experience requires two years, including a minimum of 3,000 hours; Master's or Doctorate with post degree experience requires one year, including a minimum of 1,500 hours. The HS-BCP exam is designed to verify a candidate's human services knowledge. The exam was created as a collaborative effort of human services subject-matter experts and normed on a population of professionals in the field. The HS-BCP exam covers the following areas: # Assessment, treatment planning, and outcome evaluation # Theoretical orientation/interventions # Case management, professional practice, and ethics # Administration, program development/evaluation, and supervision Employment outlook =United States= Currently, the three major employment roles played by human services graduates include providing direct service, performing administrative work, and working in the community. According to the Occupational Outlook Handbook, published by the US Department of Labor, the employment of human service assistants is anticipated to grow by 34% through 2016, which is faster than average for all occupations. There will also be excellent job opportunities for individuals with post-secondary degrees. But salaries remain low, which might reflect employers' lack of understanding of the human services profession. Professional organizations =North America= There are several different professional human services organizations for professionals, educators, and students to join across North America. United States The National Organization for Human Services (NOHS) is a professional organization open to educators, professionals, and students interested in current issues in the field of human services. NOHS sponsors an annual conference in different parts of the United States. In addition, there are four independent human services regional organizations: (a) Mid-Atlantic Consortium for Human Services, (b) Midwest Organization for Human Services, (c) New England Organization for Human Service, and the (d) Northwest Human Services Association. All the regional organizations are also open to educators, professionals, students and each regional organization has an annual conference in different locations throughout their region such as universities or institutions. Human services special interest groups also exist within the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) and the American Educational Research Association (AERA). The ASPA subsection is named the Section on Health and Human Services Administration and its purpose is to foster the development of knowledge, understanding and practice in the fields of health and human services administration and to foster professional growth and communication among academics and practitioners in these fields. Fields of health and human services administration share a common and unique focus on improving the quality of life through client-centered policies and service transactions. The AERA special interest group is named the Education, Health and Human Service Linkages. Its purpose is to create a community of researchers and practitioners interested in developing knowledge about comprehensive school health, school linked services, and initiatives that support children and their families. This subgroup also focuses on interpersonal collaboration, integration of services, and interdisciplinary approaches. The group's interests encompass interrelated policy, practice, and research that challenge efforts to create viable linkages among these three distinct areas. The American Public Human Services Association (APHSA) is a nonprofit organization that pursues distinction in health and human services by working with policymakers, supporting state and local agencies, and working with partners to promote innovative, integrative and efficient solutions in health and human services policy and practice. APHSA has individual and student memberships. Canada The Canadian Institute for Human Services is an advocacy, education and action-research organization for the advancement of health equity, progressive education and social innovation. The institute collaborates with researchers, field practitioners, community organizations, socially conscious companies‚Äîalong with various levels of government and educational institutions‚Äîto ensure the Canadian health and human services sector remains accountable to the greater good of Canadian civil society rather than short-term professional, business or economic gains.

Its symptoms are not distinct from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Signs and symptoms Examples of symptoms of childbirth-related post-traumatic stress disorder include intrusive symptoms such as flashbacks and nightmares, as well as symptoms of avoidance (including amnesia for the whole or parts of the event), problems in developing a mother-child attachment, not having sexual intercourse in order to prevent another pregnancy, and avoidance of birth- and pregnancy-related issues. Symptoms of increasing stress can be sweating, trembling, being irritated, and sleep disturbances. Cause Birth can be traumatic in different ways. Medical problems can result in interventions that can be frightening. The near death of a mother or baby, heavy bleeding, and emergency operations are examples of situations that can cause psychological trauma. Premature birth may be traumatic.Goutaudier, N, Lopez, A, S√©journ√©, N et al. (2011). Premature birth: subjective and psychological experiences in the first weeks following childbirth, a mixed-methods study. Journal of Reproductive and Infant Psychology, 29, 364-373. Emotional difficulties in coping with the pain of childbirth can also cause psychological trauma. Lack of support, or insufficient coping strategies to deal with the pain are examples of situations that can cause psychological trauma. However, even normal birth can be traumatic, and thus PTSD is diagnosed based on symptoms of the mother and not whether or not there were complications. Additionally, in the process of birth, medical professionals who are there to aid the birthing mother may need to examine and perform procedures in the genital regions. The following are correlated with PTSD: * Medical complications before, during, or after childbirth: **Pregnancy complications ** Emergency C-section ** Instrumental delivery ** Episiotomy ** Severe pain during birth ** Postpartum complications ** Preterm labour ** History of infertility ** Inadequate care during labour * Social, psychological, and other factors: ** Unwanted pregnancy ** Low socioeconomic status ** Primiparous (first labour) ** Parenting (infant caring) problems ** Social support following childbirth ** Cultural factors ** History of mental health issues ** Other life stressors Diagnosis Childbirth-related PTSD is not a recognized diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Many women presenting with symptoms of PTSD after childbirth are misdiagnosed with postpartum depression or adjustment disorders. These diagnoses can lead to inadequate treatment. Epidemiology Prevalence of PTSD following normal childbirth (excluding stillbirth or major complications) is estimated to be between 2.8% and 5.6% at six weeks postpartum, with rates dropping to 1.5% at six months postpartum. Symptoms of PTSD are common following childbirth, with prevalence of 24‚Äì30.1% at six weeks, dropping to 13.6% at six months.

The episode aired on NBC in the United States on February 16, 2012. \\"Tallahassee\\" was written by co-executive producer Daniel Chun and directed by series cinematographer Matt Sohn. The episode guest stars David Koechner and Wally Amos. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Dwight returns to Tallahassee to meet with the president of Sabre's special projects, Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). Meanwhile, in Scranton, Andy fills in for reception and thoroughly enjoys himself. \\"Tallahassee\\" saw the reappearance of Tate as Nellie Bertram. Tate had previously appeared in the seventh season finale, \\"Search Committee\\". The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics, with many reviewers noting that the \\"special projects\\" storyline helped to give the series a focus. The cold opening, in particular, received significant attention from critics, with many calling it the best of the show's eighth season. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Tallahassee\\" drew 4.38 million viewers and received a 2.3 rating/6% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, marking a 12% drop in ratings from the previous episode, \\"Special Project\\", and becoming the lowest-rated episode of the series to air, beating the previous record holder, \\"Hot Girl.\\" Despite this, it was the highest-rated NBC series of the night. Synopsis Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad), Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) travel to Tallahassee as part of a team picked for Sabre's new project. On the day of orientation, Dwight wakes everyone up at 5 o'clock in various disruptive ways. Jim, used to waking up at four AM to take care of his children, uses the extra time to stage a murder scene in his room, in order to prank Dwight. He scrawls \\"It was Dwight\\" in fake blood on the wall to make it look like Dwight murdered him, and falls out of the closet pretending to be dead. Jim discovers another side of Stanley, who demonstrates uncharacteristic energy and zeal for life. Stanley explains this is because he is on vacation, and offers Jim alcohol at various points during the day. At the orientation meeting, Dwight and Jim find that Todd Packer (David Koechner) is still working at the company after the two of them attempted to get him fired. The president of Sabre's special projects, Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) begins to talk about the project, which encompasses creating a store to rival Apple's chain of stores, and Dwight and Packer start to compete to see who will become her vice president. However, Dwight begins having stomach pains, which Ryan suspects to be appendicitis. Not wanting to be counted out for the vice manager position, Dwight stays at the meeting, but collapses during a presentation. The paramedics confirm appendicitis, and Dwight is rushed into surgery. However, three hours later, after getting his appendix removed, he returns in order to impress his new boss. After nearly butchering a slide-show presentation, he finally impresses Nellie by telling the audience that the only element of marketing that matters is \\"desire.\\" Nellie subsequently invites Packer and Dwight to have breakfast with her the following day, and Dwight is pleased that he established himself as a candidate and that he can give his appendix to his suspected son as a souvenir. Wally Amos is invited to give a speech on proper business building, but everyone is distracted by the cookies he brought, and Nellie cuts off his speech. In Scranton, the office is left without a receptionist. Not wanting to get roped into being receptionist again, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) defies Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) orders to answer the phone. With the rest of the staff similarly declining to answer the phone, Andy is left with no choice but to take on the receptionist's role himself, and performs the job with unexpected gusto. He orders new magazines for the waiting area, cooks mini-pizzas as reception snacks, color-coordinates the desk, and brings in a mail cart to deliver mail. Pam and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) attempt to talk him out of his newfound enjoyment, believing it to be linked to his lingering feelings for Erin, to no success. At the end of the day, a caller mentions that she misses Erin, which Andy agrees with. Production \\"Tallahassee\\" marked the return of Nellie Bertram, played by Catherine Tate \\"Tallahassee\\" was written by co-executive producer Daniel Chun, his sixth writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff in the fifth season. It was directed by series cinematographer Matt Sohn, his fourth directing credit for the series. \\"Tallahassee\\" marked the return appearance of Catherine Tate as a regular character, having previously appeared in the seventh season finale, \\"Search Committee\\" as a candidate to replace Michael as office manager. Tate was initially the top choice to join the cast as the manager, but due to a commitment to the West End production of the Shakespeare play, Much Ado About Nothing she was unable to join the series at the start of the season. Her character, Nellie is re-introduced as the Head of Special Projects for Sabre, and subsequently works in the Scranton office from \\"Get the Girl\\". The episode also marked the return appearance of David Koechner, who portrays Todd Packer in the series. He recently made a deal with NBC to do more episodes for the series and also possibly join the cast of series developer Greg Daniels's next series, Friday Night Dinner, an adaption of the British series of the same name. The episode also marks the ninth appearance of Lindsey Broad, who portrays Cathy, Pam's replacement during her maternity leave. She appeared in a recurring role for the season, after she initially appeared in \\"Pam's Replacement\\". Cultural references Sabre's Pyramid tablet makes a reappearance, after making its debut in the episode \\"The Incentive\\". The device serves as a parody of several tablet computers, specifically the Apple iPad. B. J. Novak described the device as \\"really the worst piece of technology that you've ever seen.\\" \\"Florida Stanley\\" tells Jim to play Kenny Loggins on his iPod in the car, but Jim confuses his request for Loggins and Messina. After Andy buys the office new magazines, Creed is shown zealously reading Dwell. Dwight compares his team to the \\"enemies of Seabiscuit.\\" At the very end of the episode Wally \\"Famous\\" Amos makes an appearance and attempts to talk about success before he is cut off by Nellie, who demands that he serve his famous cookies. The brief exterior shot of the hospital where Dwight had his appendix removed, is the same building that was used in the opening credits of General Hospital, the Los Angeles County - USC Medical Center. Reception =Ratings= \\"Tallahassee\\" originally aired on NBC in the United States on February 16, 2012. The episode was viewed by an estimated 4.38 million viewers and received a 2.3 rating/6% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 2.3% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 6% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a twelve percent drop in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Special Project.\\" In addition, the episode was, at the time, the lowest-rated episode of the series to air, beating the first season finale, \\"Hot Girl\\", which gathered 4.8 million viewers. The episode finished third in its time slot, being beaten by Grey's Anatomy which received a 3.2 rating/8% share and the CBS drama Person of Interest which received a 2.8 rating/7% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The episode beat The CW drama series The Secret Circle. Despite this, \\"Tallahassee\\" was the highest-rated NBC television episode of the night. After DVR usage was taken into account, the episode increased its viewership by 61.1%, being viewed by a total of 7.053 million viewers. =Reviews= \\"Tallahassee\\" received largely positive reviews from critics, with many noting that the Florida story-line gave the series a focus. TV Equals noted that the episode was \\"one of the best episodes of The Office this season and [possibly] one of the better episodes from the last couple of seasons.\\" Brian Marder from Hollywood.com wrote a largely positive review, noting that \\"Overall, tonight represented a significant step back in the right direction ‚Äì and hope that maybe the series still has hope... More promisingly, the humor was top-notch, funnily similar to the effortless comedy of early seasons and refreshingly dissimilar to the forced, uncharacteristic stuff that has pervaded season 8.\\" Bret Davinger from the California Literary Review noted that \\"A couple of weeks ago, I complained about The Office spending too much time away from the office. How was I to know that taking a trip to Tallahassee would produce probably the best episode of the season and maybe one of the best episodes of the past couple of seasons?\\" Davinger went on to note that the change in scenery from the office set to Tallahassee was working for the series. In addition, he noted that episode did not feature any hints of Erin's desire to stay in Florida or Cathy's attempt to seduce Jim, a move he hoped would be permanent. Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 and wrote that \\"between 'Special Project' and 'Tallahassee' it‚Äôs fair to say that The Office is on a nice little run. Everything good and funny about last week's episode spilled over to 'Tallahassee'.\\" TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella awarded the episode four out of five stars. Despite praising the episode for coming \\"together as one of the best Office episodes of the season,\\" he criticized Dwight's main plot, calling it \\"not funny.\\" The Filtered Lens reviewer Matt Dougherty called the episode \\"solid\\" and noted \\"While 'Tallahassee' was not quite as good as last week, it still is a step in the right direction for this struggling show.\\" He ultimately awarded the episode a 7 out of 10. Many reviews praised the episode's cold opening, with many critics calling it one of the funniest openings of the eighth season. What Culture! reviewer Jeffrey Kratzer, despite awarding the episode three out of five stars, wrote, Tallahassee' was so enjoyable (for the most part) that [the] next few episodes look to be the excitement and focused momentum we've been waiting for all season.\\" Conversely, The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt gave the episode a C- rating and criticized the episode's lack of complexity. He wrote that, \\"I would argue, though, that [undeveloped characters are] part of the show‚Äôs problem right now\\" and noted that Tate's performance was expanded \\"little ... beyond her initial appearance last season.\\" In a review for the subsequent episode, \\"After Hours\\", however, McNutt acknowledged that, \\"If I'm being honest with [sic], last week's probably should have been above a 'C-,' but I went with my gut and have to stand by that decision.\\" References External links *\\"Tallahassee\\" at NBC.com * * Category:The Office (American season 8) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes ","title":"Tallahassee (The Office)"},{"id":"34489015","text":"\\"Bowling for Votes\\" is the thirteenth episode of the fourth season of the American comedy television series Parks and Recreation, and the 59th overall episode of the series. It originally aired on NBC in the United States on January 26, 2012. In the episode, Leslie (Amy Poehler) has her campaign host a bowling night just to win the vote of a man who does not like her, while the rest of her staff hits the phones to raise money. Plot Leslie's (Amy Poehler) campaign holds a focus group about her, and one participant named Derek (Kevin Dorff) says he won't vote for Leslie because she doesn't look like someone he could go bowling with. An offended Leslie becomes determined to win Derek's vote by having her campaign hold a bowling night, although Ben (Adam Scott) tries to explain that there will be voters who simply won't like her. Meanwhile, Jerry (Jim O'Heir) organizes an all-night campaign fundraising event at Andy (Chris Pratt) and April's (Aubrey Plaza) house, with two movie tickets going to the person who raises the most money. Chris (Rob Lowe) wants to win so he can take his girlfriend (Jerry's daughter) Millicent (Sarah Wright) out, and April wants to win just to make the optimistic Chris sad. At the bowling night, Tom (Aziz Ansari) embarrasses Ron (Nick Offerman) and Ann (Rashida Jones) with his childlike bowling technique, but it proves very effective and he scores higher than Ron; Tom later injures his finger when getting his ball and it is unclear if Ron let the accident happen out of jealousy. Leslie challenges Derek to a game of bowling and lets him win while giving him free food and beer. He still refuses to vote for Leslie, angering her and challenging him to a rematch that she wins. An angry Derek calls Leslie a \\"bitch\\", resulting in Ben punching him. A smitten Leslie kisses Ben over a bloody Derek, of which a newspaper photographer takes a picture. Chris, who is well in the fundraising lead, announces that he is going to ask Millicent to move in with him, but Jerry privately reveals to everyone else that Millicent is planning to end the relationship; she later shows up and does so, causing Chris to leave. April wins the tickets, but feels guilty that her wish to see Chris sad came true. The next day, she buys a third ticket and offers a depressed Chris to join her and Andy at the movies, giving him a quick hug. Leslie refuses to accept Ben's resignation over the punch and holds a press conference to apologize to Derek, but she tells the reporters that she won't apologize because Derek was a jerk and Ben was right to defend her honor. At a focus group about the press conference, the participants give Leslie very favorable opinions. Ron later returns to the bowling alley in disguise and tries out Tom's technique, bowling a perfect game. Reception Critical reaction towards the episode was mostly positive. Christopher Peck of Blast Magazine called the episode \\"awesome,\\" and drew connections between Leslie's arc in the episode and the show overall. Said Peck, \\"No one can ever accuse the ensemble of 'Parks and Recreation' of being inauthentic.\\" He ultimately gave the episode an A-. Matt Fowler of IGN liked the episode, especially Ben's punch and the group booing Jerry after Millicent broke up with Chris. But, he did note that Leslie's hyper-focus, just like in the episode \\"Citizen Knope\\", can be draining.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on February 2, 2012. In the episode, Leslie (Amy Poehler) is determined to find Ann (Rashida Jones) a date for Valentine's Day, Ben (Adam Scott) struggles with a scavenger hunt, and Chris (Rob Lowe) is depressed about his love life. Plot Leslie (Amy Poehler) hosts her annual \\"Galentine's Day\\" party for her female friends but feels bad that Ann (Rashida Jones) doesn't have anyone with whom to celebrate Valentine's Day. She asks the parks department to set Ann up with someone at a Valentine's Day singles mixer that they are organizing. Chris (Rob Lowe), who is still depressed about being dumped by Millicent, decides to DJ the mixer. Meanwhile, Leslie has given Ben (Adam Scott) a Valentine's Day scavenger hunt filled with intricate riddles hidden all over Pawnee in order to discover where she wants to meet him that night, but she made it exceedingly difficult. Andy (Chris Pratt) and Ron (Nick Offerman) help Ben out, and Ron turns out to be very eager and adept at solving riddles, despite his claims to the contrary. They agree to split up and find the riddles out of order to more quickly find the last one. At the mixer, Chris plays depressing music that puts a sour mood on the event. Ann arrives and Leslie unsuccessfully tries to set her up with numerous men. April (Aubrey Plaza), who dislikes Ann, brings her creepy friend Orin as a \\"date\\", leading Leslie to harshly criticize April for being an ass towards Ann, pointing out to April that Ann would have helped her in spite of how badly April treats her, and that April showed she was just being pathetically selfish. Tom (Aziz Ansari) steps up to help Ann out, making Ann feel better with his humorous efforts. Chris tells Leslie he is sad because he is 44 years old and still single, believing Millicent may have been his soulmate, but Leslie cheers him up with a pep talk, but says he is also at fault for being single since he dumped Ann. Chris later plays upbeat music and everyone has a good time at the mixer. A grateful Ann decides to go home, but Leslie catches her applying make-up in her car. Leslie thinks Ann is going to go out with Chris, leaving her angry because of the turmoil she went through regarding her relationship with Ben, and when April tries to get her to leave them alone Leslie ignores April because she thinks April is just trying to be mean to Ann again. Ben, Ron, and Andy fail to find the last riddle, but Ron correctly guesses the meeting spot will be Li'l Sebastian's memorial site. Leslie tells Ben about Ann and Chris, and the two agree to catch them on a date to expose Chris' hypocrisy about workplace dating. To their shock, they find Ann on a date with Tom. April arrives and to Leslie's surprise explains that she helped set up Ann on a date with Tom, seeing how Tom made her laugh and that \\"this is a loser town full of loser people, and Tom's at least semi-cool.\\" Leslie is touched that April helped Ann out. Leslie and Ben leave Ann and Tom alone on their date, which Ann quickly admits was a mistake after Tom reverts to his usual chauvinistic attitude. The next day, Ron sheepishly asks Leslie to organise a riddle scavenger hunt for his birthday. Reception The episode was viewed by 3.60 million viewers, indicating a 3.15% increase from the previous episode, but still making it the third-lowest viewed episode of the series, after Bowling for Votes (3.49 million) and Road Trip (3.55 million).

When the pilot was originally written it was for Showtime, but Robert Greenblatt left Showtime for NBC and brought the series with him.

It is situated about from the Newport to Cardiff road, near a Roman fort, which gave the name to the estate. The Gaer Hillfort (alternative: the Gollars), a large circular site, is a huge fort situated in a defensive position overlooking the Ebbw River. It contains many enclosures, a large bank and a ditch. In the 17th century, the hillfort was included in the ornamental landscaping plan of nearby Tredegar House. The original Gaer House was built in the reign of Queen Elizabeth by Alexander Seys, Esq., second son of Roger Seys, Esq., of Boverton. Roger Seys was Attorney-general of Wales in the time of Queen Elizabeth. Alexander Seys had several children by his wife Elizabeth: Roger, Alexander, William, Elizabeth, Mary, and Florence. The Gaer House passed to the third son, William. The Gaer remained in the Seys family until the death of William Seys, High Sheriff for the county in 1738. He left four daughters, his coheirs. Florence, his third daughter, married Henry Montonnier Hawkins (d. May 1814), and the house passed to their son, Anthony Montonnier Hawkins in whose lifetime, the Gaer House was entirely renovated, the Elizabethan architecture destroyed, and a modern front substituted without any particular style of architecture. It stands upon a slight topographic prominence, which has views over the Bristol Channel to the coast of Somersetshire. In one area, the grounds extend to Tredegar House Country Park, on the highest portion of which are the remains of the Roman fort or encampment. By the mid 19th century, it was the home of Thomas Powell, a Magistrate and Deputy-Lieutenant of Monmouthshire, whose colliery was named the Gelly Gaer. Charles D. Phillips (1845‚Äì1912) owned the house in the early 20th century. He was apprenticed as a young man to the mechanical engineering profession, and became proprietor of an engineering business. He went on to own the Emlyn Works at Newport, along with works at Gloucester, which and branches in London and Cardiff. He also founded and published Phillips' Monthly Machinery Register, to which he added later an electrical and autocar supplement. He was also a farmer, as well as a manufacturer of and dealer in machinery and engineering plants. Phillips was a member of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and the South Wales Institute of Engineers. He was elected a member of the Iron and Steel Institute in 1890. The building is currently used as a public house and is called The Gaer Inn.

Design and development The MH.260 was designed in partnership with Nord Aviation to carry 23 passengers or of cargo on short fields, as a modern equivalent of the DC-3. The MH.260 was a high-wing, twin-engine turboprop aircraft powered by Turbomeca Bastan engines. The fuselage was of all -aluminum construction with fabric covered control surfaces. The landing gear retracted into fuselage-mounted fairings.Watkins Flying December 1961, pp. 33, 89. The prototype was built at a Nord Aviation facility, so it followed naturally that production aircraft should also be built there. The MH-260 design was taken over by Nord and production was commenced to fill a French government order for ten aircraft under the designation Nord 260.

Amnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience. First arrest At the time of his first arrest, Guo worked as a lecturer at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Shanghai, in the Department of Electronics and Information Science. In 2001, he was arrested by the Chinese government for distributing Falun Gong literature, following the 1999 ban on the religion by the Chinese government. He was imprisoned in a labor camp until 2004. Second arrest On 7 January 2010, Guo was arrested without a warrant at his home in Shanghai by eight plainclothes police officers. According to Guo's wife Xu Wenxin, one officer shoved Guo to the ground, cutting his head. His home was searched, and his cell phone, laptop computer, books, and other items were confiscated by the arresting officers. He was then taken to the Shanghai Baoshan District Detention Center. On 18 January, Guo's interrogation began. He alleges that he was deprived of sleep and food, and that his interrogators threatened to arrest Xu Wenxin, who is also a Falun Gong practitioner, unless Guo signed a confession. Guo signed a statement agreeing that he was guilty of the charge of using a heretical organization to subvert the law. In the course of Guo's legal case, his family hired five successive lawyers, each of which withdrew following alleged government pressure. One lawyer reported that he was told by the Beijing Judicial Bureau that he would be disbarred if he chose to defend Guo. On 7 July 2010, Guo was convicted on the basis of his confession and sentenced to four years' imprisonment; because his current lawyer was not informed by authorities of the date of the hearing, Guo had no legal representation at his trial. Guo stated after the verdict that he wished to retract his confession, reiterating his claim that it was obtained through torture, but the judge prevented him from finishing his statement. In March 2011, Amnesty International reported that Guo was suffering from a \\"serious eye condition\\" for which prison authorities were denying him treatment. International reaction Amnesty International designated Guo Xiaojun a \\"prisoner of conscience\\", \\"imprisoned solely because of his beliefs\\", and launched multiple international letter-writing campaigns on his behalf. The US State Department listed his imprisonment as an \\"abuse of religious freedom\\" in its 2010 International Religious Freedom Report. Charles Tannock of the European Parliament raised his case with the EP Commission for Human Rights, which in turn called on the Chinese government \\"to respect the freedom of religious belief and practice\\". The United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Heiner Bielefeldt, submitted Guo's allegations to the Chinese authorities in his 2011 report, noting the \\"continued violations of freedom of religion or belief suffered by Falun Gong practitioners in China\\". The Chinese government declined to reply.

Early life Alberton before 1875 She was born Sophia Davis in Kaitaia, Northland, New Zealand in 1847. Her parents were the private tutor John Davis, who worked for the Matthews and Puckey missionary families, and Mary Ann Cryer. In 1855 William Gilbert Puckey dismissed her father from his position and the family consequently moved to Auckland. She married Allan Kerr Taylor, a widower with substantial land holdings who was 15 years her senior, on 8 June 1865. They resided at his farmhouse, Alberton, in Mount Albert. They had six daughters and four sons, born between 1866 and 1888. The family was actively engaged in St Luke's Church, following the Anglican faith, whilst Allan Taylor's father and three half brothers were all Presbyterian. Allan Kerr Taylor's three half brothers also lived in Auckland - all near the Tamaki River: Charles John Taylor at Glen Orchard (now St Heliers), William Innes Taylor at Glen Innes, and Richard James Taylor at Glen Dowie. The names of their properties later became the names of the suburbs. It is probably to differentiate themselves from the main part of the family that the Mt Albert Taylors adopted Allan's middle name as part of their surname - becoming the Kerr Taylors or Kerr-Taylors. This may well have simply grown out of the social conventions of the period. The family gave the land for the church in the early 1870s and donated the church bells. St Luke's Church was registered with the New Zealand Historic Places Trust on 7 April 1983 as a Category II heritage building with registration number 681. Alberton was expanded to an 18-room mansion in the 1870s and became known for the garden parties, hunts, and other entertainments held there. Children Allan had two children from his first marriage but both children died in their first year, before his marriage to Sophia. Allan and Sophia's children were: Vincent Frederick (9 July 1866 ‚Äì 25 May 1920). Vincent attended Auckland Grammar School and later married Amy Evelyn Turner. Vincent died suddenly in 1920. They had a son, Colin Vivian Taylor (1906‚Äì1984). Winifred Mabel (13 August 1867 ‚Äì 18 September 1964) was the oldest daughter. She attended Auckland Girls' High School and she never married. Mildred Amy (4 March 1869 ‚Äì 24 December 1957) also attended Auckland Girls', and did not marry. Hector Randall (28 January 1871 ‚Äì 21 May 1914), unmarried. Hector had epilepsy and was tutored privately at Alberton. Adeline Daisy (31 July 1872 ‚Äì 20 February 1874) died in infancy. Adeline Violet (11 March 1874 ‚Äì 1966) also attended Auckland Girls'. She married Alfred Edward Gilmore in 1894, and they had four children. Flora Daisy (21 December 1875 ‚Äì 15 September 1885) died aged nine, of a \\"brain fever\\", which may have been a form of meningitis. Theodore Allan (13 September 1883 ‚Äì 30 April 1960) married Clare Edna Ross with whom he had four children. He later married Mabel Ebenezer Hobden. Muriel Hyacinth (17 January 1887 ‚Äì 1972), considerably younger than her sisters, was not allowed to marry a suitor because her mother did not consider him suitable, and refused to marry anyone else. Lancelot Everard (1 June 1888 ‚Äì 6 August 1955) served with the Auckland Mounted Rifles in the Middle East during World War I. He married Dulcie Monica Short, and they had five children. Later life Alberton in 2012, owned by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust Allan Taylor died in April 1890, leaving Sophia with an estate valued at ¬£20,000 but with a ¬£4,000 mortgage. Sophia had not been involved in her husband's business affairs and was unprepared for the financial burden. She sold investments and land to pay death duties and sustain the household, but the family was unable to fully maintain its comfortable lifestyle. She also sold some of their horses and carriages, and possibly reduced the number of servants, including the coachman. For the next 40 years she managed the estate, earning income from the sale of its farm produce, including vegetables, fruit, and flowers, and overseeing a flock of prize poultry that provided eggs for sale. Taylor supported the women's franchise movement because women had the same obligations as men to obey the law and pay taxes, but she was opposed to women standing for Parliament. She joined the first committee of the Women's Franchise League's Auckland branch in 1892, and also joined the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, although she was not a prohibitionist. In 1893, women gained suffrage in New Zealand. Taylor continued to be politically active on a range of issues, both speaking and writing, as late as the end of World War I. The positions she espoused included opposition to the single-tax movement and opposition to an initiative to hunt opossums for sport. From 1908, she ended her earlier custom of entertaining guests at Alberton and lived quietly there with her three unmarried daughters and her son Hector until his death in 1914. In 1916, of the estate was sold for the Mount Albert Grammar School. After her death on 24 January 1930, her three unmarried daughters, Winifred, Millicent and Muriel, took care of the estate for the rest of their lives. When the last daughter died in 1972, ownership of the estate passed to the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. Alberton is registered as a Category I historic building with registration number 26. Sophia Taylor, her husband and their children are buried at St Luke's graveyard.

It was formed in late 1914/early 1915 as a 2nd Line Territorial Force formation raised as a duplicate of the 46th (North Midland) Division. After training in the United Kingdom and saw service in the Easter Rising in April 1916, the division joined the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front in early 1917. It saw action at Ypres and Cambrai, and was almost destroyed during the German Army's Spring Offensive in March 1918. The reconstituted division took part in the final advances of the war. Origin The formation of Reserve or 2nd Line units of the Territorial Force (TF) was authorised on 31 August 1914, and the units were quickly formed from the flood of volunteers coming forward, trained by those men of the 1st Line TF who had not signed up for overseas service or were medically unfit. At first the men had to live at home, and parade in civilian clothes until the county TF associations were able to issue clothing and equipment. In January 1915, the 2nd North Midland was created as an exact duplicate of the 1st North Midland Division, the units being differentiated by '1/' or '2/' prefix. The 1st North Midland Division was the first complete TF formation to reach the Western Front, where it received the designation 46th (North Midland) Division.

In February the men were issued with .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles with which to train, and it was not until November 1915‚ÄìMarch 1916 that these were replaced with .303 SMLE rifles and Lewis guns. Similarly, the gunners had to train with 'Quaker' guns ‚Äì logs of wood mounted on cart wheels ‚Äì until March 1915 when a few 90 mm French guns arrived for training. Later, some 15-pounder field guns and obsolete 5-inch howitzers were received, without sights. In June 1915, the 2nd Line units began to send drafts of reinforcements to their 1st Line parents serving on the Western Front, while the Home Service men were transferred to provisional battalions. This reduced the strength and delayed the training of the division. In July 1915 it moved to a training area around St Albans. Here in early 1916 the artillery finally received their establishment of horses, 18-pounder field guns and 4.5-inch howitzers. Ireland The 59th was the 'mobile division' in Home Forces, held in readiness to combat a landing along the East Coast; when the Easter Rising broke out in Dublin on 24 April 1916, it was ordered into immediate readiness and despatched to Ireland, the first TF formation to serve there. Here, units of the division ‚Äì many with only a few weeks' training ‚Äì were hastily thrown into combat, some taking heavy casualties; the 2/7th and 2/8th Sherwood Foresters lost over two hundred men killed or wounded at Mount Street on 26 April and at the South Dublin Union on 27 April. After the end of fighting in Dublin, the 59th moved to the Curragh for further training until the end of the year. The division returned to England in January 1917 and began final battle training at Fovant, where there was a large purpose-built camp on the edge of the Salisbury Plain training area, before embarking for France on 17 February. Western Front =Polygon Wood= Bridge House Cemetery, named after a nearby farmhouse, was made by the 59th (North Midland) Division in September 1917. All but five of the 45 burials are of men of the division, and all but one date from the Battle of Polygon Wood.Bridge House Cemetery at CWGC. The 59th Division took part in following the German Retreat to Hindenburg Line in March and April, but it was not until September that it was engaged in its first full-scale action, the phase of the 3rd Ypres Offensive known as the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge. This was a carefully prepared assault with massive artillery preparation, and most of the objectives were taken easily.Wolff, pp. 191‚Äì5. The next phase, the Battle of Polygon Wood (26 September), was equally successful, with 59th Division advancing steadily behind its barrage onto the final objectives.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, pp. 288‚Äì9.Wolff, p. 199. =Bourlon Wood= 59th Division was next moved south to join in the Battle of Cambrai. The division entered the recently captured line between Cantaing and Bourlon Wood on 28 November. Fierce German counter-attacks began on 30 November. Two infantry assaults were made against 176 Bde, but both attacks were easily broken up under British artillery fire. Lance-Corporal John Thomas of the 2/5th North Staffords was awarded the Victoria Cross for his gallantry in reconnoitring these attacks.Miles, pp. 167, 213. That night the rest of 176 Bde in Bourlon Wood were subjected to a violent bombardment of high explosive and gas shells, but the division was not directly attacked the following morning. By 4 December the decision had been made to withdraw from the Bourlon Salient, and 59th Division held covering positions while this was carried out. By 7 December the British were back on the line that they would hold for the coming winter.Miles, pp. 226, 262‚Äì7. As a result of the BEF's manpower crisis at the end of 1917, the establishment of each infantry brigade was reduced from four to three battalions in January 1918. In 59th Division, each brigade saw one battalion disbanded to provide reinforcements, and one other absorbed its 1st Line parent from the 46th Division. =Spring Offensive= When the German Spring Offensive opened on 21 March 1918 (the Battle of St Quentin), 59th Division was holding the line of the Bullecourt Salient, with a thinly held 'Forward Zone', covering Bullecourt itself. This was where the heaviest German attack fell, following a hurricane bombardment and covered by morning mist. The battalions in front were driven from their defences and forced back through the village. Here and in the defences further to the north west a few survivors fought on for some hours. 176th and 178th Brigades were virtually destroyed (only one front-line officer of 176 Brigade made it back), and the reserves moving up were swamped. The division's field guns in the forward zone were captured after firing over open sights at the advancing Germans. The line was held by rear details, including the gunners using rifles and Lewis guns. Only two batteries of 59th Divisional Artillery escaped.Edmonds, 1918, Vol I, pp. 228‚Äì32.Blaxland, p. 48.Middlebrook, pp. 192‚Äì3, 232‚Äì4, 254‚Äì5, 270, Appendix 8.Farndale, p. 265. Over the next few days, 177th Brigade and the remaining divisional artillery remained in action under the command of 40th Division, fighting rearguard actions during the British Army's 'Great Retreat'.Edmonds, 1918, Vol I, pp. 387‚Äì8, 441‚Äì5, 530‚Äì1. 59th Division was sent north to recuperate (without its artillery), but there the survivors were caught up in the second phase of the Spring Offensive at the Battle of Bailleul (14‚Äì15 April) and the Battle of Kemmel Ridge (17‚Äì18 April). About 2,000 men of the division, under Brig-Gen C.H.L. James of 177th Brigade, formed 'James's Force' and fought on for a couple more days under the command of 49th (West Riding) Division, but then the exhausted 59th Division was withdrawn from the front line.

Cope and Major General Cecil Romer. In May 1918 the shattered 59th Division was temporarily disbanded at Saint- Omer and its battalions and trench mortar batteries reduced to training cadres, the surplus men being drafted to other units. However, the Divisional Artillery (CCXCV and CCXCVI Bdes) remained in the Line, serving with various formations as required: 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division (15‚Äì24 April and 17 May‚Äì19 June), 37th Division (24 April‚Äì17 May), XVIII Corps (23 June‚Äì1 July), 5th Division (1‚Äì8 August) and 61st (2nd South Midland) Division (8‚Äì26 August). The 59th Division was reconstructed at Hestrus from Garrison Guard battalions sent from the United Kingdom. Until June, it was employed in digging rear defences, then it underwent training to enable it to hold a sector of the front line. On 25 July the reconstructed division went back into the line. Reconstruction The order of battle of the reconstructed 59th Division (the 'North Midland' designation was no longer relevant) was as follows: =176th Brigade= * 6th/7th Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers (joined as training cadre from divisional pioneers 7‚Äì10 May 1918, left for England 18 June 1918) * 1st Provisional Garrison Guard Battalion (joined from Reserve Army 13 May 1918; became 17th Garrison Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment 25 May 1918, left 18 June 1918) * 2nd Provisional Garrison Guard Battalion (joined from Reserve Army 13 May 1918; transferred to 177th Bde 22 May 1918) * 3rd Provisional Garrison Guard Battalion (joined from Reserve Army 13 May 1918; transferred to 177th Bde 22 May 1918) * 4th Provisional Garrison Guard Battalion (joined from Reserve Army 13 May 1918; became 23rd Garrison Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers 25 May 1918, left 18 June 1918) * 5th Provisional Garrison Guard Battalion (joined from Reserve Army 13 May 1918, became 17th Garrison Guard Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment 25 May, then 17th Battalion 16 July 1918) * 4th Garrison Guard Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers (joined 16 May 1918, became 26th Battalion 16 July 1918) * 25th Garrison Guard Battalion, King's Regiment (Liverpool) (joined 16 June 1918, became 25th Battalion 16 July 1918) * 176th Trench Mortar Battery (reformed 11 July 1918) =177th Brigade= * 2/6th Garrison Guard Battalion, Durham Light Infantry, (joined from England 10 May 1918; became 2/6th Battalion 16 July 1918) * 11th Garrison Guard Battalion, Somerset Light Infantry (joined from England 12 May 1918; became 11th Battalion 16 July 1918) * 15th Garrison Guard Battalion, Essex Regiment (joined from England 12 May 1918; became 15th Battalion 16 July 1918) * 2nd Provisional Garrison Guard Battalion (joined from 176th Bde 22 May 1918; redesignated 25th Garrison Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps 25 May, and became divisional pioneers 16 June 1918) * 3rd Provisional Garrison Guard Battalion (joined from 176th Bde 22 May 1918; redesignated 13th Garrison Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment 25 May; to 178th Bde 16 June 1918) * 177th Trench Mortar Battery (reformed 17 August 1918) =178th Brigade= * 36th Garrison Guard Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (joined from England 12 May 1918, became 36th Battalion 16 July 1918) * 11th Garrison Guard Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers (joined from United Kingdom 12 May 1918, became 11th Battalion 16 July 1918) * 2nd Garrison Guard Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment (joined from Ireland 17 May 1918, became 8th Garrison Battalion 25 May and left 19 June 1918) * 13th Garrison Battalion, Duke of Wellington's Regiment (from 177th Bde 16 June 1918; became 13th Battalion 16 July 1918) * 25th Garrison Guard Battalion, Cheshire Regiment (joined from England 24 May 1918, left 19 June 1918) * 178th Trench Mortar Battery (reformed 24 June 1918) =Support troops= ;Mounted Troops * XI Corps Mounted Troops (attached 17‚Äì21 October and 9 ‚Äì14 November 1918) ** 1st King Edward's Horse ** 11th Cyclist Battalion, ACC ;Artillery * CCXCV Brigade, RFA ** A, B, C and D (H) Batteries * CCXCVI Brigade, RFA ** A, B, C and D (H) Batteries * 59th Divisional Trench Mortar Brigade, RFA ** X.59 and Y.59 Medium Trench Mortar Batteries * 59th Divisional Ammunition Column, RFA ;Engineers * 59th Divisional Engineers ** 467th, 469th and 470th Field Companies, RE ** 59th Signal Company, RE ;Pioneers * 25th Garrison Bn, King's Royal Rifle Corps (from 177th Bde 16 June 1918; dropped 'Garrison' title on 16 July 1918) ;Machine Guns * 25th Battalion, MGC (joined from 25th Division from 23 July to 19 October 1918) ** 7th, 74th, 75th and 195th Companies * 200th Battalion, MGC (joined on 2 October 1918) ** A, B, C and D Companies ;Medical Services * 2/1st, 2/2nd and 2/3rd North Midland Field Ambulances, RAMC * 59th Mobile Veterinary Section, AVC ;Transport * 59th Divisional Train, ASC ** 513th, 514th, 515th and 516th Horse Transport Companies ;Labour * 250th Divisional Employment Company, Labour Corps ;Attached Allied Troops * III Artillery Brigade, Portuguese Expeditionary Corps (CEP) (3 October to 15 November 1918) * 14th Infantry Battalion, CEP (3 October to 2 November 1918) * 15th Infantry Battalion, CEP (3 October to 15 November 1918) Advance to Victory On 21 August the 59th Division once more took part in active operations, at the Battle of Albert. 59th Divisional Artillery rejoined on 27 August. From 2 October until 11 November 1918 the division participated in the final advance in Artois and Flanders. On 2 October, 59th Division ordered two minor operations in which detachments advanced under cover of smoke and a creeping barrage; these determined that the enemy had retired, and so the division advanced against little opposition.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 126-7. On 16 October the division fought its way through the old defences of Lille, and liberated the city against minimal opposition the following day.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 408-13. Opposition stiffened at the River Schelde was approached, but this was crossed in early November. The Armistice on 11 November found the division astride the Schelde north of Tournai.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 419-23, 543‚Äì5. Demobilisation After the Armistice, 59th Division moved first to the area around Lille and then around B√©thune. It was engaged in training and education. On 8‚Äì10 December it sent 178th Brigade, with 2/2 NM Field Ambulance and 516 Co ASC to Dunkirk to operate a dispersal camp for miners who were being demobilised early from the British Expeditionary Force. On 13‚Äì15 January 1919, 177th Brigade moved to Dieppe for demobilisation duties, where it was joined on 25 January by the pioneer battalion to build the demobilisation camp. On 8 March, Divisional HQ moved to Calais, and during the month other units followed. On 21‚Äì23 May, the units of 176th Brigade left for service in Egypt (the Brigade HQ was disbanded in July) and were replaced on 16 June by 19th Brigade transferred from 33rd Division: 19th Brigade * 6th Battalion, Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) * 5th/6th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) * 10th Battalion, Cameronians By now, the division's responsibility was to train drafts for the forces serving in Egypt and the Black Sea. 59th Divisional Artillery was demobilised on 8 August, and on 29 August orders arrived to break up the rest of the division. Divisional HQ closed on 1 September 1919, and during the month the remaining cadres returned to England.

These movements are voluntary intentional movements on one, ipsilateral, side of the body that are mirrored simultaneously by involuntary movements on the contralateral side. The reproduction of involuntary movement usually happens along the head-tail axis, having a left- right symmetry. For example, if someone were to voluntarily make a fist with their left hand, their right hand would do the same. In most cases, the accompanying contralateral involuntary movements are much weaker than the ipsilateral voluntary ones, although the extent and magnitude of the mirrored movement vary across patients. This disorder has not yet been found to be associated with any other neurologic disease or cognitive disability, and currently, no cures nor means to improve signs or symptoms have been found. The congenital mirror movements begin in infancy and persist throughout the patient‚Äôs life, often with very little improvement, or deterioration. Consequently, patients who do suffer from this movement disorder have serious difficulty carrying out tasks that require manual dexterity or precision, such as playing a two handed musical instrument or typing on a keyboard, for their whole lives. Patients also often experience discomfort or pain in the upper limbs due to prolonged use of the same muscles. Therefore, quality of life can be severely hampered. CMM disorder‚Äôs prevalence in the world is thought to be less than 1 in 1 million people. Because of its rarity, researchers suggest that some mildly affected individuals may never be diagnosed. It is important not to confuse congenital mirror movement disorders, a rare genetically based neurologic disease, with acquired mirror movement disorders that present themselves during one‚Äôs lifetime due to other reasons (stroke for example).  Causes  The specific molecular mechanism that underpins this movement disorder is not well known. However, most researchers suggest that it follows an autosomal dominant genetic inheritance pattern in which mutations in certain genes give rise to structural abnormalities in nervous system networks responsible for voluntary skeletal muscle movement, which, in turn, result in the functional movement abnormalities seen in patients. Despite being autosomal dominant, it is important to note that the disease has variable expressivity. That is, patients who have inherited a mutated dominant allele, along with their genetically affected parent, can be symptomatic or asymptomatic for CMM disorder. The genes that currently have evidence to be associated with CMM disorder include DCC (deleted in colorectal carcinoma), DNAL4 (dynein axonemal light chain 4), and RAD51 (recombination protein A). DCC encodes a receptor for NTN1 (netrin-1), a protein thought to be responsible for axon guidance and neuronal cell migration during development. A mutation of this gene (including nonsense, splice site mutation, insertions, frameshift) has been identified as a possible cause for CMM disorder. Experiments in mice also support the claim that CMM disorder is associated with genetic mutations in DCC. Kanga mice, lacking the P3 intracellular domain of the DCC receptor, show a hopping gait, moving their hind legs in a strictly paired fashion, as do kangaroos. DNAL4 encodes a component of dynein motor complex in commissural neurons of the corpus callosum. In contrast to DCC, DNAL4 is thought to have a recessive inheritance pattern for the CMM disorder. In CMM disorder patients, researchers found splice site mutations on DNAL4, which caused skipping of exon 3, and thereby omission of 28 amino acids from DNAL4 protein. This mutant DNAL4 protein, in turn, could lead to faulty cross- hemisphere wiring, resulting in CMM. RAD51 maintains genome integrity by repairing DNA double-strand breaks through homologous recombination. RAD51 heterozygous mutations, specifically premature termination codons, have been found in many CMM disorder patients through genome-wide linkage analysis and exome sequencing. In a mouse model, researchers also found RAD51 products in corticospinal tract axons at the pyramidal decussation. They therefore suggest that RAD51 might be a gene that, when haploinsufficient, causes CMM disorder in humans. Despite identification of three prospective genes, no genotype- phenotype correlations have yet been found. That is, the severity of clinical signs and symptoms does not correlate with the type of genetic variant. Mutations in the above genes account for a total of about 35 percent of cases. Mutations in other genes that have not been identified likely account for the other cases of this disorder.  Pathophysiology  There are three main pathophysiological hypotheses for congenital mirror movement disorder that exist. = Interhemispheric connections = First, some researchers believe that this neurological disorder is due to abnormal communication between cerebral hemispheres. They explain the mechanism of the physiological miscommunication with on development. Amongst many neuronal changes in the brain during normal human brain development, researchers claim that the corpus callosum shows a gradual increase number of myelinated axons. This suggests that up until a certain age, the corpus callosum is heavily unmyelinated. This would explain why children during normal development can be seen with CMM disorder up to the age of 7 years, likely due to lack of corpus callosum development. The normal disappearance of clinically significant mirror movements after this age is associated with anatomical and functional maturation of interhemispheric connections through the corpus callosum between motor cortices. Researchers hypothesize that this axonal density in the corpus callosum is responsible for the interhemispheric communication that is ultimately responsible for the suppression of mirror movements during voluntary movements in healthy adults. Therefore, disruptions in corpus callosum circuits could lead to CMM. = Motor cortex = Another pathophysiological explanation that researchers suggest for CMM disorder is that there is a miscommunication during motor movement execution. This claim is supported by evidence of structural abnormalities in the primary motor cortex (M1) in CMM patients. These structural abnormalities in the motor cortex might explain why the hands, requiring great motor dexterity and therefore have a large cortical representation, are often the target of and suffer from more severe mirror movement in CMM disorder. = Corticospinal tract = A third pathophysiological explanation proposed by researchers has to do with the corticospinal tract (CST). Healthy newborns in fact have ipsilateral CST projections up until the age of around 7. During normal adult development, these axonal projects disappear. This might provide an alternate explanation for the presence of mild mirror movements in normally developing young children that typically disappear before the age of 7. Some researchers propose that DCC mutations cause a reduction in gene expression and less robust midline guidance, which may lead to a partial failure of axonal fiber crossing and encourage development of an abnormal ipsilateral connection. This is confirmed by other researchers who demonstrate that patients with DDC mutants show an increased proportion of ipsilateral axonal projections, and show that even a very small number of aberrant ipsilateral descending axons is sufficient to induce incorrect movement patterns. These findings are corroborated by evidence from mice models, Kanga mice with a deletion of DCC, whose CST has been shown not to be altered, but rather partially rerouted ipsilaterally.  Diagnosis  Currently, clinical diagnosis of CMM disorder has been based on clinical findings or molecular genetic testing. Clinical Findings (Signs and Symptoms): * onset of mirror movements in infancy or early childhood * persistence of mirror movements into and throughout adulthood with the absence of other neurologic disorders * little improvement nor deterioration of mirror movements over the course of one‚Äôs life * intensity of mirrored movements increasing with the complexity of the voluntary movement * involuntary mirror movements that are generally of lesser amplitude compared with voluntary movements * predominant mirror movement in upper limbs, with increasing severity in more distal appendages (fingers) * inability to perform tasks requiring skilled bimanual coordination * occasional pain in the upper limbs during prolonged manual activities * occasional observed subclinical mirroring movement, but detectable with accelerometer gloves Molecular genetic testing: * identification of a heterozygous mutant DCC, DNAL4, or RAD51 gene (single gene test or multi-gene panel)  Treatment and Management  CMM has clear severe impacts on a patient‚Äôs ability to carry out daily manual tasks. It is recommended that children be placed under more forgiving school environments, allowing more time for written evaluations and limiting handwritten assignments, to ease the burden of the movement disability. Furthermore, because of patients‚Äô inability to perform pure unilateral movements and their difficulty with tasks requiring skilled bimanual coordination, young and new members to the workforce are encouraged to consider professions that do not require complex bimanual movements, repetitive or sustained hand movements, or extensive handwriting, to reduce overuse, pain, and discomfort in upper limbs. Because of its pronounced and obviously noticeable signs and symptoms, CMM patients can suffer social stigma; however, physicians need to make it clear to parents, family, and friends that the disorder bears no relation to intellectual abilities. However, the rarity of this neurologic disease, found in one in a million people, makes its societal and cultural significance quite limited.

At the 2011 census, Mowanjum had a population of 295.  History  The Mowanjum Community began as a mission of the Presbyterian Church 1912. It was originally known as the Port George IV mission and a few years later as Kunmunya. The mission was located in the very isolated and rugged North West Kimberley coast of Western Australia. In 1951 this mission was moved south to Wotjulum near Yampi Sound and finally to the outskirts of Derby near the airport in 1956. The name Mowanjum was inscribed in the Derby marsh in 1956 by David Mowaljarlai. It means \\"settled\\" or \\"on firm ground. The 3 men attributed to founding the Mowanjum Community are Albert Barunga, Alan Mungulu and David Mowaljarlai. The community was again shifted in 1975 to its present site 10 km east of Derby following government requirements for additional land for the Derby Airport. Strong links to traditional country have been preserved and the numerous outstations, including Pantijan, Kunmunya, Dodnun and Yallon etc. are directly linked to both European and traditional history. Mowanjum's outstations are under Mowanjum community management. Mowanjum includes people from three main language groups: * Wunambal * Worrora * Ngarinyin Between 300 and 500 people reside at Mowanjum Community depending on seasonal conditions in surrounding language group areas. Mowanjum Community has its own art and cultural organisation MASWAC (Mowanjum Artists Spirit of the Wandjina Aboriginal Corporation). It was founded in 1998 by Mowanjum Community Administrator Maxine Clarke, Mowanjum Kimberley Tafe Arts lecturer Mark Norval and its first chairperson Donny Woolagoodja. In 2002 community administrator John Oster and MASWAC compiled a business plan to build a Gallery-Museum at Mowanjum at a cost of 2.8 million dollars. Mark Norval of Kimberley TAFE, community chairperson Edward Mungulu and Mark Davies community administrator developed further business plans and funding options for the project. During 2004 and 2006 this new Art Centre was constructed by Leamy Constructions of Derby at a final cost of 5 million dollars. The principal funds for the project came from the Australian Federal Government 2.2 million, the Western Australian State Government 2.2 million and Aztec Mining Co of South Perth 0.4 million. The Mowanjum Arts and Cultural Festival is one of Australia's longest running indigenous festivals. It has run annually since 1998 under the guidance of MASWAC and Mowanjum Cultural Projects Officer Peter Croll. The artists from MASWAC have had major exhibitions in Perth 1998, Melbourne 1999, Sydney 1999, Sydney Olympic Games 2000, Slovenia 2000, Broome 2003, Perth 2007.

Magnuson (February 21, 1909 ‚Äì June 24, 1995) was a Canadian trade unionist and Communist leader. Magnuson was born in the Swedish province of V√§rmland and grew up on his parents' farm. He immigrated to Canada in the spring of 1928 at the age of 19 and worked on farms in Saskatchewan before settling in the Lakehead district of northern Ontario in 1933 where he got involved in a bushworkers' strike led by the Lumber Workers Industrial Union of Canada. He was hurt working in the bush and spent several months in hospital convalescing during which time he read the Communist Manifesto and other leftwing literature and decided to join the Communist Party of Canada. Magnuson was elected president of Local 2786 Lumber and Sawmill Workers' Union in 1940 and led the union until 1951 when Communists were purged by the parent union, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, after which Magnuson organized a breakaway union, the Canadian Union of Woodworkers In 1946, he led a strike that is credited with establishing the Lumber and Sawmill Workers Union on a broad basis in northern Ontario winning recognition of the union by lumber companies as the bargaining authority for workers in the pulpwood industry and establishing collective bargaining in the region's timber industry. From August 1940 to August 1942, Magnuson was interned first at Camp Petawawa and later at an internment camp at Hull, Quebec as a subversive under the Defence of Canada Regulations. He and other communists were released after the Soviet Union became an ally as a result of Germany's invasion of the USSR. Magnuson was on the founding executive of the Labor- Progressive Party in Ontario and a frequent candidate. In the 1957 federal election, Magnuson was the Labor-Progressive candidate in Port Arthur against Liberal cabinet minister C.D. Howe but withdrew a few weeks prior to the election in order to support Co-operative Commonwealth Federation candidate Douglas Fisher who went on to defeat Howe by 1,400 votes in an upset victory Magnuson had won 923 in the 1953 federal election in Port Arthur. He became leader of the Labor-Progressive Party in Ontario following its crisis in 1956 when provincial leader Stewart Smith, former MPP J.B. Salsberg and hundreds of other party members left in the aftermath of Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech, the 1956 Hungarian Uprising as well as revelations about the extent of anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union under Stalin. Magnuson led the Labor- Progressive Party in the 1959 Ontario election, and remained leader of the party as it renamed itself the Communist Party of Canada (Ontario) and contested the 1963 and 1967 provincial elections He last ran as a Communist Party candidate in the 1984 federal election in Sudbury winning 75 votes. He remained a member of the Central Executive of the Communist Party of Canada in the mid-1980s. He died in Toronto in 1995.\\"Deaths\\", The Globe and Mail, June 26, 1995, pg.

It is Number 31 in the catalogue of the composer's works. Conception Expo is the penultimate in a series of works dating from the late 1960s which Stockhausen designated as \\"process\\" compositions. These works in effect separate the \\"form\\" from the \\"content\\" by presenting the performers with a series of transformation signs which are to be applied to material that may vary considerably from one performance to the next. In Expo and three companion works (Kurzwellen for six performers, Spiral for a soloist, and Pole for two), this material is to be drawn spontaneously during the performance from short-wave radio broadcasts . The processes, indicated primarily by plus, minus, and equal signs, constitute the composition and, despite the unpredictability of the materials, these processes can be heard from one performance to another as being \\"the same\\" . Each plus, minus, or equal sign indicates that, upon repetition of an event, the performer is to increase, decrease, or maintain the same level in one of four musical dimensions (or \\"parameters\\"): overall duration of the event, number of internal subdivisions, dynamic level, or pitch register/range. It is up to the performer to decide which of these dimensions is to be affected, except that vertically stacked signs must be applied to different parameters . Despite this indeterminacy, a large number of plus signs (for example) will result in successive events becoming longer, more finely subdivided, louder, and either higher or wider in range; a large number of minus signs will produce the reverse effect . To the signs previously used in Prozession, Kurzwellen, and Spiral Stockhausen adds some new ones. History P. E√∂tv√∂s, D. von Biel, G. Rodens, W. Fromme, H. Albrecht; second row, second from left: H.-A. Billig; far right: C. Caskel In 1968 the West German World Fair Committee invited Stockhausen to collaborate on the German Pavilion at the 1970 World Fair in Osaka, Japan. Other collaborators on the project included the pavilion's architect, Fritz Bornemann, Fritz Winckel, director of the Electronic Music Studio at the Technical University of Berlin, and engineer Max Mengeringhausen. The pavilion theme was \\"gardens of music\\", in keeping with which Bornemann intended \\"planting\\" the exhibition halls beneath a broad lawn, with a connected auditorium \\"sprouting\\" above ground. Initially, Bornemann conceived this auditorium in the form of an amphitheatre, with a central orchestra podium and surrounding audience space. In the summer of 1968, Stockhausen met with Bornemann and persuaded him to change this conception to a spherical space with the audience in the center, surrounded by loudspeaker groups in seven rings at different \\"latitudes\\" around the interior walls of the sphere (; ). In addition, Stockhausen would participate by presenting daily five-hour programs of his music . Stockhausen's works were performed for 5¬Ω hours every day over a period of 183 days to a total audience of about a million listeners . Expo was written, as the title indicates, for these performances and was composed in K√ºrten in December 1969 and January 1970, at that time under the working title of Trio . Between 14 March and 14 September 1970, Expo was played and sung many times at the German Pavilion at Expo '70, in daily performances by twenty different musicians including the composer . The English group Intermodulation (Roger Smalley, Tim Souster, Peter Britton, and Robin Thompson) performed it a number of times and made recordings for the radio . Structure and technique Expo is a more relaxed and cheerful piece than its companions, and features an unusual degree of synchronised gestures and canonic imitation . It consists of a sequence of approximately 135 events, grouped into two large sections divided in the score by wavy barlines, each interrupted once by an insert lasting up to 2¬Ω minutes. One of these inserts is slow, the other fast; both are characterised by a synchronised periodic beat. Stockhausen explained that in pieces like this, \\"the first step is always that of imitating something and the next step is that of transforming what you're able to imitate\\" .

It had its World Premiere at the Slamdance Film Festival on January 22, 2012.http://slamdance.festivalgenius.com/2012/films/buffalogirls_toddkellstein_slamdance2012 The film was singled out in several previews of the festival, including those by the Los Angeles Times, the Salt Lake City Weekly and the Park Record.Park Record, January 17, 2012. Scott Iwasaki. ‚ÄúSlamdance Has Created Filmmaking Community.‚Äù Park City, UT. Film critic Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called the film \\"unexpected and fascinating.\\" The film received a favorable review in The Hollywood Reporter, and was reviewed locally by Salt Lake Magazine, and SLUG Magazine. Plot The documentary is an intimate look into the lives of two very young, professional Muay Thai fighters: Stam Sor Con Lek and Pet Chor Chanachai. At only eight years old, the two girls fight throughout rural Thailand to earn money to support their families, as well as trying to secure the 22-kilogram Muay Thai Championship belt of Thailand. The film also addresses the culture of children's fighting through interviews with the children's parents, the referees who officiate the fights, and the professional gamblers who bet on them. The impoverished farming communities of rural Thailand offer few opportunities for economic gain and boxing is one of the few alternatives to the country‚Äôs commercial sex trade as a means of escaping the extreme poverty. Child boxers in Thailand can often earn a family‚Äôs monthly rent from a single bout, sometimes taking home more than what a farmer or factory worker earns in a month. For the film‚Äôs young protagonists, boxing is an opportunity to help their parents supplement the family income and improve their standard of living. Production Filmmaker Todd Kellstein was working on a documentary about Thai prisons when he came across children boxing in a rural province. Kellstein became enamored with what he saw and enlisted the help of producer Lanette Phillips and co-producer Michael J. Pierce to help finance the production of the film. What he thought would be a six-week project required a three-year stay in Thailand, in order to understand the culture, learn Thai, and earn the trust of his young subjects. In researching the film, the filmmaker attended close to 300 fights in different provinces around the country. Prior to Buffalo Girls, Kellstein‚Äôs film background was in directing music videos. It was during his time as a music video director where Kellstein met Phillips and Pierce, as well as Jonathon Ker, the films's other producer. Kellstein had worked with prominent artists such as Bon Jovi, but he went to Thailand looking for something else. He told the Los Angeles Times that, initially, he thought he was witnessing child abuse. During the process of making the film, however, he changed his mind and sought to create a balance in presenting the potentially controversial subject matter. 13 ‚à® MSNBC http://video.msnbc.msn.com/msnbc.com/46893890#46893890  References   External links  * Buffalo Girls website * * Slamdance Film Festival * Filmmaker Portraits from Park City * Film Threat interview *MSNBC News Story ] Category:2012 films Category:2012 documentary films Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:Muay Thai films Category:American Muay Thai films Category:Documentary films about child abuse ","title":"Buffalo Girls (film)"},{"id":"34489889","text":"Parnngurr is a medium-sized Aboriginal community, located 370 km from Newman in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, within the Shire of East Pilbara. Parnngurr was originally known as Cotton Creek, the name of the ephemeral creek that runs beside the community. Local area The community sits within Karlamilyi National Park. The park is the largest in the state, and one of the most rugged and remote in Australia. There are no park facilities outside the Parnngurr and Punmu settlements. The popular Desert Queen Baths lie about a half day's drive away along the Rudall River track; also in the area is Kalkan Kalkan Soak, Hanging Rock, Parnngurr Hill (Mt Cotton) and Parnngurr Rock Hole, as well as numerous bluffs, caves, creeks and bush tracks for the adventurous. Facilities The community shop provides residents and visitors with fuel, food, cold drinks, some camping and vehicle gear, and fresh fruit and vegetables. The community also supplies emergency medical facilities, accommodation, visitors' camping, caravan parking and laundry. Fuel supply is reliable and many visitors to the Canning Stock Route and Karlamilyi National Park stop in Parnngurr to refuel and pick up supplies. Staff and residents are very knowledgeable about the area and are happy to provide advice on road conditions and places to visit.

It is located between The Street and Hibb's Green and is just under a mile off the A134 between Bury St Edmunds and Sudbury.Get-a-map - enter Hanningfields Green in the \\"search for\\" box History Hanningfield Green was a medieval green that takes its name from the Hanningfield family, the manorial lords in the fourteenth century. The green covered an area between the two forked roads to All Saints Church and Hart's Green in the north-west and to Lawshall Green and Shimpling in the south-east. Hanningfield Green and Hibb's Green were known as Halk Street in the 1567 Lawshall Survey, with Shimpling Road being referred to as Maltland Street. Henningfeld Greene is depicted on a map of 1611 and Faden's map of 1783 names it as Hinyfields Green. The green was partly enclosed in the nineteenth century. At Hanningfield Green a length of moat (since infilled) is shown on the west side of Hanningfields Farm on the 1842 tithe map. This is the site of the manor house of \\"Henrfeildes\\" Manor that was recorded on a map of 1611. An Alicia de Hanigfeld is mentioned in 1327. Lawshall Evangelical Free Church Lawshall Evangelical Free Church. Setting of Lawshall Free Church Lawshall Evangelical Free Church is located at Hanningfield Green. The church was born out of the desire of local Evangelical Christians in the village of Lawshall and the surrounding villages to undertake their own form of worship. Evangelistic activities by outside bodies (including The Faith Mission) resulted in some conversions and from about 1968 people met in various houses for worship and bible study. Eventually a legacy from the late Walter G Waspe of Lawshall Hall made financial provision for a new church which was opened for worship on 1 August 1970. The initial accommodation comprised a chapel, vestry, kitchen and toilets. Further additions were made in 1978 with a hall and new toilet facilities. A baptistry was also incorporated in the hall for services entailing baptism by immersion. In July 1976 the church appointed its first Pastor, David Bedford-Groom, who continued to minister and lead the church on a part-time basis for 12 years while continuing his profession as an accountant. In 1989 Michael Holmes, a retired building surveyor, took over as the full-time pastor until his retirement from the ministry in 1998. He was replaced by Pastor Antony Finnie in September 2000. As a Free Church they have no authoritative body beyond the local congregation. The church is not isolationist and since 1996 they have been affiliated to the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches. Services are held each Sunday morning (11.00am) and Sunday evening (6.30pm). The morning service is followed by tea and coffee. Communion is every second and fourth Sunday evening of each month. Other parts of the church diary include a Coffee Morning (on the first Tuesday of most months), the \\"Sparkz\\" kids' club, \\"Little Treasures\\" Parent and Toddler Group and Thursday Prayer Meeting. Designated County Wildlife Site The triangular area of unimproved grassland between Hanningfield Green and Shimpling Road is parish land that has been designated as a County Wildlife Site in recognition of the range of native flora that grows there. At present Hanningfield Green is being managed as a hay meadow in the traditional manner. The essential requirements are a hay cut when the flowers have set seed and the removal of the cut material. A second cut is carried out in September. Whilst the area may not represent the best that Suffolk has to offer, it is part of the history and heritage of Lawshall and one of the richest remaining grasslands in the parish. In addition to the sight of buttercups on the green, there is quite a variety of broad leaved plants. These include blue bugle, pink cuckoo flower, edible common sorrel, cowslip, the strange adder's tongue and the occasional orchid. Inevitably there is a period in July, prior to hay cut, when the green does not look at its best. It is a time of ripening seeds and it is therefore important not to cut down the plants in the name of tidiness at this crucial time. Listed buildings Entrance to Hanningfields Farm.

The community lies between the Shaw and De Grey Rivers. History Indigenous Australians have lived in the area for thousands of years. The first European to arrive in the area was Francis Thomas Gregory, who travelled through as part of his expedition in 1861. Pastoralists soon followed and established both sheep and cattle stations throughout the area displacing the Indigenous inhabitants but employing them as cheap labour leading to the 1946 Pilbara strike. The community was established as an offshoot of the Strelley Station, a pastoral lease that operated as a sheep station and later became a cattle station. An Indigenous group, the Nomads, which remained connected to Don McLeod until his death in 1999, acquired a number of pastoral leases including those at Coongan and Strelley in 1972. The Aboriginal community at Strelley had more than 800 residents until social problems caused by alcohol from the nearby town in Port Hedland led to the group‚Äôs mass exodus from Strelley to other locations including Warralong. The pastoral leases continued to operate despite following Brucellosis outbreak and were never abandoned or relinquished. An alcohol ban was formally imposed on the community in 2013 following a spate of alcohol-induced violent incidents.  Native title  The community is located within the Registered Warrarn 1(WAD82/98) Native Title claim area.  Education  A school was originally established at Strelley in 1976 and later at a Warralong. Children of school age attend the Strelley Community School (Warralong campus and Strelley campus), which specialises in traditional languages and on-country learning. The school at Strelley was badly damaged by Cyclone George in 2007 and reopened in 2009.

Background In October 2011, Jessica Buchanan and Poul Hagen Thisted, who had been working on a demining project with the Danish Refugee Council, were captured by Somali pirates in Galkayo. Attempts by the Council to enlist local Somali elders and traditional leaders to assist in freeing the hostages were unsuccessful, and the pirates refused an offer of US$1.5 million ransom. With Buchanan's health declining, U.S. officials decided to launch a raid against the pirates using several different United States special operations forces, including elements of the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group. Raid Early on January 25, 2012, two dozen Navy SEALs parachuted from a C-130 Hercules 2 miles north of the Somali town of Cadaado, where pirates had held the pair of hostages in hopes of ransoming them. The SEALs then traveled by foot from their drop zone, attacked the compound, and engaged the pirates, killing all nine of them.

Her father died in 1909, the year of her birth. Her mother returned to Australia and Peggy was educated at Rose Bay Convent, Sydney, as well as in France and England. On 5 November 1936 she married, in London, Colin Kelman, an Australian farmer. Colin and Peggy Kelman then returned to Australia continued as graziers both in Moree, NSW and Julia Creek, Queensland; the couple had 5 children. Death Peggy McKillop Kelman died in 1998 in Buderim, Queensland, aged 89. Aviation career Kelman began flying training in 1931 at the Aero Club of NSW and gained her A licence (now called private pilot licence) in 1932, followed by a commercial pilot licence in 1935. Her first and only paid job was flying for Nancy Bird Walton, barnstorming in western NSW in 1935. While barnstorming near Moree, NSW, Kelman met a young grazier with his own aeroplane, his name was Colin Kelman. After their marriage in London, Peggy and her husband bought a used twin-engined light aircraft, a Monospar, and decided to fly home to Australia. That adventure began 19 December 1936.

It was founded in 1961 but disappeared from the Official Airline Guide 15 years later before finally going out of business in 1986.  History  A Sikorsky S-61 of the airline. San Francisco and Oakland Helicopter Airlines was one of the first helicopter airlines to operate without a federal subsidy and it was also the first to operate with only turbine engine helicopters. Since helicopter landing sites were scarce at that time, the port of Oakland's board committee supported the service. Passenger flights started with two leased 10-passenger Sikorsky S-62 turbine helicopters. In late summer of 1961, the SFO Helicopter Airlines system timetable stated that 68 flights a day were operated,http://www.timetableimages.com, Sept. 1, 1961 SFO Helicopter Airlines system timetable with the airline claiming that its helicopters made less noise than neighborhood trucks. In 1962, the U.S. Post Office Department granted San Francisco and Oakland Helicopter Airlines airmail contract number AM-103, allowing it to transport U.S. Mail until 1976. Also in 1962, SFO Helicopter was operating flight seeing aerial tours on weekends and holidays during the summer months from Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco with a fare of $4.50 for adults and $3.50 for children.http://www.timetableimages.com, Aug. 1, 1962 SFO Helicopter Airlines timetable In 1965, the airline tried operating a 15-seat Westland-Bell SK-5 hovercraft between San Francisco International Airport (SFO), Oakland International Airport (OAK), and San Francisco.http://www.airfields- freeman.com/CA/Airfields_CA_SanFran.htm#sanfrandowntown In 1969, it carried 320,000 passengers on more than 100 flights a day. According to the April 27, 1969 SFO Helicopter Airlines timetable, each arriving and departing flight at SFO served not one but two gates: American Airlines gate 45 and TWA gate 53 with staggered arrival and departure times for each flight at each gate being reflected in the timetable.http://www.timetableimages.com, April 27, 1969 SFO Helicopter Airlines timetable, San Francisco Airport schedules In May 1968, after continuous growth, the company's schedule reached 14 weekday departures from the San Francisco Ferry Building,http://www.airfields- freeman.com/CA/Airfields_CA_SanFran.htm#sanfrandowntown 11 from Marin, 13 from Berkeley, three from a parking garage in Oakland (known as AlcoPark), and 9 from Lafayette. For interline passengers connecting at SFO and then heading east beyond Colorado, the ticket to SFO cost $4.75 from Marin or Lafayette and only $4.50 from Berkeley. The San Francisco and Oakland Helicopter Airlines' fleet as of 1965 was made up of one Sikorsky S-62 helicopter and three Sikorsky S-61N helicopters. The airline was declared bankrupt in July 1970 and by the end of the year, destinations had been reduced to Marin, Berkeley, SFO, and OAK. In 1973-1974, Emeryville replaced Berkeley as one of their reduced destinations. According to the October 26, 1975 SFO Helicopter Airlines timetable, 53 flights were being operated on a daily basis with an additional 26 flights being operated every day except on Saturdays with service being flown from San Francisco International Airport, Oakland International Airport, Marin County and Emeryville.http://www.timetableimages.com, Oct. 26, 1975 SFO Helicopter Airlines timetable They disappeared from the Official Airline Guide in 1976 and had gone out of business altogether in 1986.

He was the primary antagonist of the Dutch East India Company in the Second Khoikhoi‚ÄìDutch War. Despite the Company's opposition to war with the Khoikhoi, individual soldiers aroused the ire of the Cochoqua by looting their cattle; by the early 1670s, Gonnema and his tribe were sufficiently incensed to take up arms.Wilmot, Alexander; History of the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope: From its discovery to the year 1819; Longmans, 1869 In 1673 Gonnema murdered a hunting party of eight burghers.Theal, George McCall; History and Ethnography of Africa South of the Zambesi, from the Settlement of the Portuguese at Sofala in September 1505 to the Conquest of the Cape Colony by the British in September 1795, Cambridge University Press, 2 Dec 2010 p484 A commando unit led by Ensign Hieronymous Cruse was sent against him,Moodie, D; The Record: Or, a Series of Official Papers Relative to the Condition and Treatment of the Native Tribes of South Africa Cambridge University Press, 22 Dec 2011 which failed to capture the tribe's kraal.Burman, Jos√©; Who really discovered South Africa?, Struik, 1969, p48 However, they were successful in taking prisoners, who were subsequently executed. Gonnema's men also attacked and plundered the Company's fort at Saldhana Bay. Beyond these attacks, Gonnema waged a primarily defensive strategy for the remainder of the hostilities.Elphick, Richard; The Shaping of South African society, 1652-1840, Maskew Miller Longman, 1989, p14 The following year a combined force of Europeans, burghers and Khoikhoi (the Goringhaiqua and Gorochouqua tribes) was sent against Gonnema, but again failed to capture him. Rather than retaliating immediately, Gonnema responded by preventing the local tribes from trading with the Europeans,Muller, C.F.J. Five hundred years: a history of South Africa, Academica Press, 1986, p56 although in November he raided the Europeans' Khoikhoi allies. He attacked the Goringhaiquas and Gorochouquas again at Tigerberg in early 1675, where fifteen Cochoquas were killed by Dutch East Inda Company reinforcements. Gonnema himself, however, escaped once again. Another commando unit was sent against the Cochoqua in 1676, but again they failed to capture Gonnema, returning instead with a handful of prisoners and several hundred head of cattle. By 1677 Gonnema was willing to sue for peace, an act which was well received by the Dutch. A settlement was reached whereby Gonnema's tribe would pay tribute of 30 head of cattle each year.

It is the last painting he made in Saint-R√©my-de-Provence, France. The painting is part of the large van Gogh collection of the Kr√∂ller- M√ºller Museum, located in the Hoge Veluwe National Park at Otterlo in the Netherlands. Production and influences Road with Cypress and Star was painted in May 1890. In an earlier letter to his brother Theo, van Gogh wrote that cypresses were \\"always occupying [his] thoughts\\" and that he found them \\"beautiful of line\\" and proportioned like an Egyptian obelisk. He had also intended on painting a nighttime view of the trees since his stay in Arles in 1888. Erickson suggests that the painting is influenced by the Christian allegory The Pilgrim's Progress, visible in the prominent road and cypress tree. The painting is one of several in which van Gogh uses cypresses prominently, and ‚Äî as in Road with Cypress and Star ‚Äî many of the paintings depict trees that extend beyond the top of the canvas. After finishing the work, in June 1890 while at Auvers-sur-Oise, van Gogh wrote to his friend and fellow artist Paul Gauguin that the painting's themes are similar to those of Gauguin's work Christ in the Garden of Olives. The orientation of the night sky objects may have been influenced by a conjunction of heavenly bodies on 20 April 1890, when Mercury and Venus were at 3 degrees of separation and together had luminescence comparable to Sirius. Analysis According to Kathleen Powers Erickson, Road with Cypress and Star more strongly reflects van Gogh's belief that he would soon die than the earlier painting The Starry Night. She supports this by comparing the evening star on the left of the painting, which is barely visible, to the emerging crescent moon on the right side; the cypress tree in the middle, which divides these symbols of the old and the new, is described as an \\"obelisk of death\\". She finds the pair of travellers an indication of van Gogh's need for companionship. Naomi Maurer also writes that Road with Cypress and Star reflects the painter's feeling that he would soon die. She views the painting as depicting human life as being \\"in the context of infinity and eternity\\", with the two travellers and their journey dominated by the cypress in the centre. The evening star and crescent moon on either side of the tree she describes as adding \\"cosmic perspective to the earthly scene\\" and suggesting a \\"sentient universe filled with love\\".

It aired on Fox Network in the United States on November 21, 2011. Synopsis A 14-year-old patient is admitted with what appears to just be severe teenage angst, but the team grows concerned over her increasingly worsening symptoms. However, despite Foreman's objections, House is instead obsessed with solving the case of a deceased four-year-old, landing in serious trouble. Meanwhile, Park tries to get Chase to admit the reason behind his recent obsession with grooming. Plot House and most of his team are discussing a case when Foreman comes in with another case. He tells House the patient presented with idiopathic anaphylactic shock and it has stumped three doctors. However, House tells Foreman the case he's working on started with an asymptomatic patient whose kidneys were fried within a year but stumped four doctors, including a department chair from Harvard Medical School. They go back and forth until House says his patient is four and consistently at death's door. Foreman concedes and goes to leave when Adams lets it slip that House's patient has been dead for five years. Foreman gives House the file. After Foreman leaves, Taub notes that if House sticks with the dead boy, not only is the living patient likely to die, but House will be going back to jail and his team will be fired. House hands Taub the file for the live patient and walks off with the file for the dead one. The team starts discussing the case when Chase comes back from the dentist. Park is looking for a new dentist and asks Chase who he saw, but Chase just comes up with a generic last name and Park wonders why he can't remember the name of the dentist he just saw. Chase tries to alibi himself, but Park notices he has a fresh manicure and wonders why he lied about going to the dentist. He says he lied to avoid talking to his colleagues about where he was. Taub and Adams try to do a differential, but Park wants to know why Chase is embarrassed about having had a manicure when he's the type of guy who gets his hair cut frequently and obviously doesn't mind people knowing his grooming habits. Chase cuts Park short by suggesting they do more comprehensive drug tests and getting the patient's mother out of the room before they ask her about drugs again. Adams asks the patient, Iris, but she denies any drug use. Adams starts doing a medical history. However, Taub talks to the patient's mother, who admits because Iris is so moody, she gives her diazepam and tells her it's Vitamin C. Taub realizes diazepam explains all the patient's symptoms. He reassures the mother all they have to do is keep her off the drugs and she will be fine. However, Iris starts vomiting. Taub realizes they're probably wrong about the diazepam. House goes to see Wilson for help with the dead boy's case, but Wilson tells him that if Foreman finds out, he will send House back to jail. Wilson starts to think House wants to go back to jail to get away from his own self- destructive habits, but House dismisses the suggestion. House starts throwing out suggestions, but Wilson deflects by talking about old movies. All of a sudden, House shouts out ‚Äúdamn‚Äù and tells Wilson he's late for his anger management class. House is at group therapy, but he's really there to make a connection with the dead boy's father, who is in the same group. He starts suggesting possible symptoms they missed, but the father denies the boy ever had such symptoms. After the session, House approaches the father to say he needs to have the boy exhumed. The father dismisses the idea because the mother, his ex-wife, would never agree to it. However, House talks to him about how hard it is not to have an answer. The father does tell House where the child was interred. Iris shows some sensitivity in her abdomen and breasts. She admits her periods haven't been regular. Taub suggests a pregnancy test, but the patient says she has never had sex. Adams goes to touch her arm to reassure her they only need a drop of blood to test, but the patient complains she can't feel her arms anymore. House goes to the cemetery and bribes the caretaker. Luckily, the child was interred in a sarcophagus. However, House panics when his cell phone goes off when he's in the crypt. It's Adams telling him Iris is pregnant. As he does a differential with his team, he opens the sarcophagus. He's also realized Chase has recently arrived and has no idea what they're talking about. Park notices Chase has just had his eyebrows waxed and House realizes Chase has also had a Brazilian wax. Chase says he has a new girlfriend. House examines the dead boy and finds no obvious abnormalities. Chase suggests the patient may have a complication of HIV. House orders tests to confirm as well as an MRI to rule out tumors. House returns to the dead boy and examines his fingers. Iris tests negative for HIV, so the team goes to look for a tumor. Adams asks Chase about his waxing and he says there's nothing more profound than him being vain and shallow. The MRI is negative for tumors. When they return to the patient, the numbness in her arms is gone, but they are covered in bruises. House returns to the hospital and his team updates him. House orders Taub and Chase to do an environmental scan and Adams and Park to run tests. Foreman asks House where he's been. House tells him that he should check with the monitoring company. Foreman says he already did, but the signal was interrupted during a test run during the same time House was out of the hospital. House says if he had known, he would have gone hang gliding. Foreman warns him that if he catches him, it won't just be extra clinic duty; he will have his parole revoked. House tells Wilson he thinks the dead boy had heavy metal poisoning. Wilson tells him he's addicted to puzzles. House goes back to the anger management group, which he's moved to a new location, and gets the father to come with him to the ‚Äúwashroom‚Äù. However, the new location is right next to the dead boy's old home. House starts an environmental scan. The environmental scan starts ruling things out and Taub tells Chase he knows he's lying about the Brazilian wax because Taub has had one and it hurts more than ‚Äúa bit‚Äù. Chase admits he wanted to look good because he's appearing on a television segment. Taub wants to know when it's on, but Chase said it aired two hours ago, and he just wanted to distract everyone long enough to keep them from finding out. Chase finally finds a hidden panel in the patient's room with love letters and very hard-core pornography. House and the dead boy's father go into his old house. House starts collecting samples. The dead boy's father starts drinking. The father finds one box containing his son's remaining possessions. House notes they have lead paint. They hear someone coming and leave. Iris starts talking about her boyfriend. She still denies having had sex and says the pornography is the boyfriend's. The mother is angry. Finally, Iris tells them her boyfriend was there last night and told her she should leave, but she didn't want to. The boyfriend hit her, which explained the bruises they found. When the mother goes to call the police, Iris says she will deny everything. All of a sudden, her vision becomes fuzzy. House takes the dead boy's father back to his apartment to run tests for heavy metals. However, they're all negative. The father starts telling House about how his son used to mispronounce words. House asks the father how the mother managed to get through it without getting angry and miserable too. The father says the mother acts like it never happened - she never even cried. Wilson catches up to Foreman and ask why he cares if House works two cases. Foreman tells him it won't stop there. Wilson warns Foreman that House won't drop it, but Foreman says that given the choice of returning to prison, House will eventually back down. Iris's vision improved to normal during her eye exam. The team comes to discuss the case, but Taub and House are watching Chase's television appearance playing a stereotypically Australian doctor. House orders an MRA for TIA and heads down to the clinic even though he doesn't have clinic duty. Drew's mother is down in the clinic, ostensibly for a free flu shot, when House asks why she didn't feel any emotion over her dead son. He starts insulting her over her lack of emotion and she slaps him. House said he deserved the slap, but was hoping she wasn't capable of such an emotional response because it would indicate hereditary hyperthyroidism. The mother realizes House knows the father and says that the father is obsessed with re-living the event. She says that when the boy died, the father was overwhelmed and she vowed that wouldn't happen to her. However, she left him because his eyes reminded her too much of their son. All of a sudden, House asks who used to babysit the boy. She says it was her father, but her father is too emotional about it too and she tells House to leave him alone. However, House has thought about how people can have multiple sides to their personality. He goes to tell Iris that he found her boyfriend and he ran away and was hit by a car. Iris tells him he's lying. House asks how she knows. She starts swearing at House says it's because ‚ÄúI‚Äòm right here‚Äù. House realizes the patient has dissociative identity disorder. They explain the disorder to Iris and her mother. The doctors believe it was triggered by the auto accident she was in when she was two. It appears the bruises were self-inflicted, and she probably just had sex without remembering it. The diazepam the mother gave her masked the illness, but removing it made it more apparent. The mother admits giving her diazepam for what she thought were ‚Äúmoods‚Äù. Chase tells Iris they have to separate her physiological symptoms from her psychological ones, which means getting in touch with all her personalities. She will need hypnosis. Wilson warns House that if he keeps going like this, once he screws up Foreman may get fired, but House will be going back to prison. House agrees to back down. House starts thinking. Finally, he comes up with an idea. He lies to the monitoring company about getting a flat tire on the way to a chiropractor appointment and goes to the grandfather's house. He pretends to be from the coroner's office. House asks questions about what they did together but the grandfather tells him they just spent most of their time watching television. However, at that point, the mother and her new husband come in and the husband punches House. Chase does the hypnosis and finds a little girl personality who can't move her arms and feels pain when she eats strawberries or thinks about the accident she was in when she was two years old. She blamed herself for the accident because she was crying and distracted her father before the crash. Her mother embraces her and they notice the patient is bleeding severely from her groin. They plot the symptoms of each personality on the whiteboard. The bleeding wasn't from a miscarriage and she still tests positive for pregnancy. They start thinking preeclampsia or ectopic pregnancy and realize they have to do an ultrasound. However, when they do the ultrasound, they can't find an embryo. House thinks they screwed up the pregnancy test, but three different team members did three different positive tests. House realizes that the test only measures elevated HCG levels, which usually only occur when there is a pregnancy, but can also be caused by a choriocarcinoma, which explains the obvious physical symptoms. It's probably hidden which is why it didn't appear on ultrasound. House tells them to tell the patient about her cancer. House goes to the lounge and finds Wilson, who realizes how he got the black eye. House says he's ruled out several possibilities, and Wilson warns him that he and Foreman are about to collide and it will be massive. Wilson says he's not listening and House says he's being juvenile. Wilson realizes that he's kept talking even though he should have known House would never listen. However, a statement about ‚Äúdeaf ears‚Äù makes House think of something. House goes to the dead boy's mother's house. She sees him outside with her new son. She goes to confront him and finds her ex-husband is there as well. House tells her that Drew died of Alport syndrome. She says she doesn't care. Her husband comes to confront him too, but House keeps yelling at her that it's genetic. Both she and her father have the gene - he's noticed the father is slightly deaf, a symptom that characterizes the condition. It's likely her son has it too. She accuses him of lying. He points out that both of her sons have trouble hearing high pitched sounds, which is why it seemed that her dead son was having trouble pronouncing words. Her current son has the same problem, but the disease is treatable. The police arrive to take House away. The mother starts crying and tells her ex-husband that she misses their son too. They start Iris on chemotherapy, and she starts to improve. House is waiting in Foreman's outer office. Foreman is in his office with Wilson. Foreman was sure that since Cuddy's threats of extra clinic duty always got House in line that the threat of jail would too. Wilson says that's a perfectly rational belief. Foreman tells Wilson he has to send House back to jail. Wilson reminds him that House saved two lives. Foreman says it's too late to back down from his threat - if he backs down, House will realize he can get away with anything. Wilson tells Foreman his job is to keep the hospital running. Cuddy did that by managing House and tells Foreman that House can be managed, but he can't be controlled. Foreman comes out to see House. He asks what Cuddy would have done. House says she would have assigned ten more clinic hours. Foreman tells House Cuddy isn't there anymore and he can do thirty extra hours. Reception The Onion's AV Club gave this episode a C+ rating.

It aired on Fox on November 28, 2011. A district attorney appears to suffer from a heart attack while cross-examining a witness. The initial diagnosis is hyper-anxiety, but the team finds an arsenal at the patient's home and start to believe that his extreme paranoia is a physical symptom. Wilson becomes convinced that House is lying about not having a gun, which leads to an epic battle of wits between the two men. Park tries to be more social with her workmates, while Taub and Chase wonder why Foreman hasn't had a romantic relationship in a while. Plot In the middle of devastating a witness on cross-examination, a district attorney goes to the judge to ask for a recess because he thinks he is having a heart attack. The judge calls for an ambulance. Foreman tells House about the case; the patient didn't have a heart attack. House thinks it's an anxiety attack, but Foreman has already ruled it out by lying to the patient to get him to relax. House gets interested. House calls his team together to do a differential. After they go through the possibilities, House figures it's a toxin and orders tests and an environmental scan. He also tells them to check out the patient's wife because he thinks she may have done it. When Chase complains he doesn't want to do the work alone, House allows him the choice of Taub or Park. Chase and Adams both call dibs on Taub, but Adams ‚Äúsettles‚Äù for Park. Chase and Taub run into Foreman on the elevator and compliment him for lying to the patient to rule out anxiety. However, they are concerned Foreman is misbehaving and tell him to get a girlfriend. Foreman assures them he's just trying to make sure House does his job. Chase tells him that a girlfriend is a better idea than trying to keep track of House. Taub agrees despite his alimony and child support obligations. Adams and Park are driving to the patient's house. Adams is telling her how wonderful her new car is, but Park thinks she's avoiding talking about why she doesn't want to work with her. Adams assures Park that House's belief that no-one wants to work with her is simply his way of getting under everyone's skin. The wife is talking to Taub and dismissing the possibility that someone would want to poison her husband. Everyone at work likes him, even the criminals he prosecutes. She says he only eats stuff he brings from home. Taub thinks the patient is afraid of something, but when Chase talks to the patient, he tells Chase that his first job was at the health department and he knows how dirty restaurants can be. Chase asks him if he got any strange packages or letters, but the patient denies it and notes his three kids are healthy and it's unlikely they would not have been exposed to something that made him sick. Chase brings up the possibility of his wife deliberately poisoning him, and the patient dismisses it. The wife tells the same thing to Taub. Park and Adams are having no luck, and Park wants to run in case someone called the police - they would give a prosecutor's home higher priority. However, as they go to leave, Park notices that the walls of two adjoining rooms are a lot further apart than they should be. Adams thinks she's kidding about there being a secret room, but Park remembers seeing a magnet of the type used to open child-proof cabinets on their refrigerator and tells Adams to get it. Park sees a spot behind the books, applies the magnet, and swings back the bookcase. They call House and tell him that the patient has an arsenal of weapons. When Park and Adams go to confront the patient about the discovery, he explains that he built it in secret to keep the city from finding out. The wife is surprised to find out, and questions why he felt he needed such an arsenal. Park and Adams go to report to House, who has already figured out what the patient told them - that he was afraid the government was going to collapse. Adams is astounded, but House says that's what everyone with a bunker full of guns is afraid of. Chase thinks it might be a symptom, but Adams and Park get into an argument. House orders tests for everything they've suggested. He returns to clinic duty and picks the most attractive clinic patient to examine. Park asks Taub who's more paranoid; the patient or her. He replies he doesn't think the patient has a mental illness and tells Park not to let House get to her. However, Park says she doesn't think the team respects her and Chase doesn't even try to hide it. Taub says Chase just likes working with him and does respect her. Foreman interrupts them and asks to speak to Taub. Foreman asks Taub to stop telling the nurses he‚Äòs looking for a girlfriend. Taub denies it, but Foreman asks why he keeps getting lunch offers and boxes of cupcakes. However, Taub says he's been too busy to even think about talking to nurses. However, Park realizes he's lying and Taub says it's for Foreman's own good. House tells Wilson the patient is just stupid, but Wilson reminds House he owns a gun. House says that's different - the patient has an arsenal, and House denies owning a gun. Wilson tells him he does and, as a felon, if he's caught with it he could go back to jail. House says he doesn't need a gun, the only thing worth stealing would require a crane to remove it. Wilson is still not convinced. House is very attached to his possessions and likes dangerous things even making fireworks. Wilson pretends to give in, but House realizes he's lying and Wilson admits he is. All of Adams' and Chase's tests are coming out negative. They start talking about the ‚Äúfeud‚Äù and Adams wants to know why Chase didn't pick Park that morning. Chase says Park is weird. Adams counters that Park is a good doctor, but Chase says good doctors can be weird, like House. He admits Adams is weird too, but it's easier to put up with her because she's hot. He backs up and says she's normal and a pleasure to be with. She calls him weird. They start talking about guns. He thinks she likes shooting sport weapons for fun. Chase makes up a story about shooting kangaroos, but Adams realizes he's screwing with her. The wife is staying with her husband, but he wants her to give her mother a break. She's worried that he thinks the world is coming to an end. He assures her that he hopes he never has to use them. However, Park discovers he's bleeding from a sore on his leg. The patient has also developed a fever. They decide to do a biopsy of the sore and start treatment for sclerosis. Park goes to ask House why she's calling her an idiot when it's obvious he doesn't really believe that. She says she doesn't mind him making fun of her, but she doesn't like being manipulated. He assures her he's only making fun of her, but she says she deserves some respect. He assures her that people respect her, they just don't like her. The patient's wife has left the hospital and the patient believes it's because he lied to her. He assures the doctors he's not crazy. Chase reassures him. Foreman and Nurse Regina are arguing about why the paperwork hasn't been entered in the computer when House leaves the clinic early because he got an emergency page. Foreman tells Nurse Regina to find someone who can do the paperwork because he has to leave. House arrives home to find Wilson in a net trap. Wilson sent the emergency page and calls House an ass. House won't let Wilson out of the trap until he admits that House is too clever to let Wilson ever find a gun even if he had one and will always be one step ahead of him. Foreman is at the gym with a punching bag when he gets a page. When he goes to answer it, a beautiful young woman, Anita, introduces herself and asks him how bad his day was to take it out on the punching bag, but Foreman thinks Taub sent her and threatens to treat him like the punching bag. However, Anita says she doesn't know what he's talking about. Foreman is still suspicious, but Anita says she will be in the gym for a while if he changes his mind. Foreman picks up his phone again. Taub is on the other end telling Foreman the patient is wrecking things and tells him he's got to go. The patient is put in restraints. He was hallucinating he was being attacked by bears and Adams says that points to clinical paranoia. Adams and Park argue about whether it's new or old paranoia when Chase interrupts to suggest it may just be a mental illness because all the tests are negative. Park still thinks it's a brain infection, but Adams thinks it's autoimmune. House agrees with both Adams, orders treatment for GAD; steroids and immunoglobulin. Park follows House and tells him that she's not paranoid and it's not that her teammates don't like her, they just don't know her that well. House arrives home again and finds a trip wire that he spots before he actually trips over it. He sees an open closet door. He pulls the wire with his cane. The trap springs harmlessly and Wilson delightedly jumps out of the closet only to have his spirits fall when he sees House standing untrapped. House tosses him and his trap out the door. House returns triumphantly to his apartment, only to lock himself in the bathroom when the doorknob comes off in his hand. He finds the second door locked too. He goes to examine the first door, but the doorknob to that one falls off too. House looks through the hole in his door and sees Wilson on the other side. He concedes defeat. Foreman goes to Anita's house and they start making out. However, they hear a man call her name and she tells Foreman he has to go right away. As he leaves, she tells him it's her husband. The patient's fever climbs. Park calls House, who is still stuck in his bathroom. Park says that it must be an infection, but Adams says they probably just started treatment for GAD too late. House orders more steroids. Park objects because if it's an infection, the steroids will be fatal. House counters that if it's an infection, they're probably already too late but they can still treat GAD or at least slow its progress. However, Park keeps arguing they can treat an infection. House finally gives in, but tells them ordinary antibiotics would be useless - they need to identify the infection. He orders tests. Adams reminds him that he just ordered more steroids, but House tells her he changed his mind and to follow Park's instructions. Wilson finishes searching House's apartment and admits there's no gun, although he found his own sunglasses, tennis racket and money clip. Park and Adams are still arguing about the diagnosis. Chase breaks in to say maybe House was right to let them have a fight to settle things. Foreman interrupts again to speak to Taub. Foreman is trying to blame Taub for almost having him get beat up by Anita's husband by screwing with his head. Taub tells Foreman he needs a life so he won't come back to the hospital at midnight just to yell at him. He asks Taub to stay out of his business. Taub still proclaims his innocence. However, when he leaves, he tells Chase that although he got off to a bad start, he's glad Foreman is trying. Chase calls him an idiot and their pagers go off. They arrive at the patient's room to find him in anaphylactic shock. Chase performs a tracheotomy, but it doesn‚Äòt restore breathing. Taub calls for epinephrine. Nurse Anne tells him they already tried it, but Taub realizes that the blockage must be below the incision and that they have no other option. They manage to get the patient breathing again, but they realize the anaphylaxis and edema rules out both infection and GAD. Allergy also seems to be ruled out because it wouldn't get worse after admission. House turns back to toxins, but there was no-one with the opportunity to poison the patient on all occasions. However, Park suggests squamous-cell carcinoma. Although it wouldn't cause hallucinations, related paraneoplastic syndrome would. House orders a biopsy. House finds Wilson in his office. Wilson confronts him with a gun he found in House's apartment. Wilson was sure House would have moved the gun, so he went back after he searched House's apartment the first time. House denies it's a gun, or that something looking like a bullet is a bullet. He says it's a magic prop. Wilson doesn't believe him, but House gives him the gun to shoot him. Wilson refuses, but House goes to shoot Wilson instead. He then shows Wilson the barrel is plugged by sticking a pencil in the barrel half-way. Wilson is confused, and House asks him to admit he found nothing. Wilson admits House has won. When Wilson turns around, House lets the pencil drop all the way into the barrel, showing us the gun is real. House looks at the ‚Äúgun‚Äù and starts thinking. He goes to see his team and tells Park, and everyone else, they were wrong. It wasn't tracheal edema that blocked his airway, it was a pseudo-membrane growing across the trachea. The patient isn't even paranoid - he was poisoned by a bacterium. House asks for a bronchial scope and warns the patient he won't be able to breathe, but he has to look down his windpipe through the tracheotomy hole. When House tells Park to call the CDC for anti-toxin, she realizes it's diphtheria. They didn't consider it because no one gets it anymore. House realizes the patient hasn't been getting the vaccine for it. Foreman goes to congratulate Taub. He tells Taub he's just been at a meeting about parking. The patient slowly starts to improve. He cheers up when his wife shows up. However, she tells him she's moved the kids out of the house. She says she doesn't like being lied to and she can't live with all the guns. She says that when he gets out, he can move in with them, but they can't return to their old house. He embraces her. Foreman is working hard on his paperwork when Nurse Regina comes in. She invites him to a staff get-together, but he says he has too much work to do. She tells him to drop by if he changes his mind. Park sees Adams and Chase in the elevator while leaving work. She invites Chase for a drink. Chase asks her if Taub put her up to it, but she says she's been thinking about it for a while and decided to ask. Chase says it's a bad idea to socialize with colleagues, but Park knows about Cameron. He finally agrees to go out that evening. Foreman is still working. He grabs his phone and tells someone he's changed his mind. House puts his gun back in its box. He then takes his father's sword out to look at it. Foreman meets Anita at the bar.

In response, Iran summoned the Dutch ambassador in July 2018.Bozorgmehr Sharafedin (July 7, 2018), Iran summons Dutch ambassador, condemns deportation of its diplomats: IRNA Reuters. In January 2019, the government of the Netherlands accused Iran of having arranged the assassinations of two Dutch nationals of Iranian origin: Mohammad Reza Kolahi Samadi in 2015, and Ahmad Molla Nissi in 2017. The incident caused outcry both in the Netherlands and internationally; EU responded with sanctions against Iranian intelligence.. Trade The Netherlands was formerly one of Iran's leading trade partners in Europe. At least 65 Dutch companies have economic ties with the Islamic Republic. In spite of economic sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union, Shell, a UK-registered Anglo-Dutch oil company continues to buy billions in crude oil from Iran each year.  Political-economic conflicts  In 1974, Persian students occupied the Persian Embassy in Wassenaar, out of protest against suppression and executions in Persia. Considering the 100 guilder fine too low a punishment for the students, the Persian government suspended all imports from Netherlands for a while. In 2008 Alaeddin Boroujerdi, head of Iran's Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, warned the Netherlands not to air Geert Wilders' anti-Muslim film Fitna. Iran has criticised the Netherlands for funding Radio Zamaneh. During the 2009 public unrest and demonstrations in Iran, Majid Ghahremani, Iranian ambassador to the Netherlands, accused the Dutch government of interfering in Iran's internal affairs.

It aired on Fox Network in the United States on January 23, 2012. While in the hospital for an Alzheimer's disease drug trial, the patient starts suffering from severe vomiting and increasingly explosive temper. As the case proceeds, it becomes clear to the team that there is more conflict in the patient's marriage than either spouse is willing to let on. Meanwhile, Wilson treats a woman who claims to be in a chaste marriage and House becomes obsessed with proving her lack of interest in sex has an organic cause. House and Foreman literally play mind games over House's case and the subject of House's ankle monitor. Plot Andres Tavares, a patient with Alzheimer's disease, is being tested for signs of dementia when he loses his temper and all of a sudden Andres starts coughing violently, and coughs up blood. Foreman is presenting the case to House's team when House arrives. They start a differential diagnosis and House orders them to discontinue the anti-emetics and do an upper endoscopy. Meanwhile, Wilson is treating Kayla, who reveals during her examination that she and her husband have never had sex because they are asexual. Chase speaks to Foreman, who assures Chase that, although he and House have had issues in the past, his judgment and objectivity won't be affected by that. Foreman also has to decide whether to have House's ankle monitor removed. Chase advises him to stay out of the diagnostic office. Wilson tells House about the asexual patient. Wilson says she's perfectly healthy except for a routine bladder infection. House bets $100 he can find a medical reason she doesn't want to have sex. Wilson doesn't want to let House anywhere near her, and House agrees to diagnose her from her file and any remaining blood and fluid samples that might be left. Wilson agrees. House comes to see Foreman's office with the results of the endoscopy. Foreman reluctantly agrees to drop what he's doing. They figure the tear was the result of the vomiting. Foreman suggests steatohepatitis and House agrees to treat for it. However, House wants to do a biopsy under anesthetic to confirm. Foreman thinks that an ultrasound would be less invasive, but realizes he's trying to overrule House again and says it was just an observation. House mocks him and goes to leave, but Foreman stops him, realizing that House is just trying to break Foreman's confidence in himself and reverses House by ordering the ultrasound. On their way to the patient, Foreman intercepts Chase and Adams, accusing them of using the ultrasound machine they're so obviously taking to the patient to guide the biopsy. He goes to look for a biopsy kit, but just finds a card from House predicting that Foreman will waste his afternoon following his fellows. Chase warns Foreman not to play mind games with House over this. Natalie comes and tells them Andres has started vomiting again. When she offers him a pan to vomit in, he violently attacks her. Foreman rushes in to sedate him. They notice that he has urinated and that it's tinged with blood. The team discusses why Andres attacked his wife. They discuss whether a person in Natalie's position should remain faithful. They run into Foreman, who reminds them that he was right not to take him off the anti-emetics. He blames House for the attack on the wife. House reminds him that taking Andres off the anti-emetics gave them a new symptom. He also reminds Foreman that he wanted to put the patient under anasthetic, which would have prevented the attack. Foreman says he's just rationalizing after the fact. House gets Park to get a card from under another chair, which says the patient was going to punch his wife, plus another saying Foreman would accuse him of faking the first card by making it up after the fact. It's obvious Foreman was right. Adams thinks it's thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. House orders plasmapheresis and asks Foreman if that's okay. Foreman just glares at him. Chase goes to explain the procedure to Natalie and Joseph. He asks about her eye injury from Andres' attack. She asks Joseph to leave and when he does (after kissing her goodbye), she denies having an affair although she admits she has talked to him about it. Chase advises her to go home and get a good night's sleep. House enlists Adams and Park to help him diagnose the asexual woman. However, her hormone levels are normal. Adams wonders what the big deal is, and House tells them it's a primary biological function. Park suggests the woman has a spinal cord injury which blocks the sensation from her genitals. Adams thinks it might be psychological, and when House rejects that because of her close relationship, Adams suggests that she might be lacking a brain chemical that helps women build relationships. Park shoots down this theory because of her own experience - she's had sex with men without wanting to bond with them. Adams suggests she must be lying, but House rejects that - after 10 years she would have left her husband. Natalie comes back refreshed. However, when they go to see Andres, he's not in his room. It soon turns out he's left the hospital. Foreman apologizes, but the nurses were all busy with codes the previous night and weren't there to monitor him. He's called the police and has his security staff searching for him. Chase apologizes for suggesting it was okay for Natalie to leave. She says she has to go look for him, but when she turns to leave, House stops her. He realizes that she finally did have sex with Joseph and she's feeling guilty, not angry. He tells her that she has to sit, focus, and answer their questions. House and Foreman realize that Andres is probably confused and has reverted to old patterns. His reminder board says it's Saturday, so they ask what he usually did on Saturdays before he got sick. She lists a few things and Chase realizes that soccer practice was one of them, and that the patient's room also has soccer memorabilia. The old practice field is nearby. The team goes to the field and wonder where he would have waited for children to arrive. They finds him, cold and unconscious, nearby. They start CPR. They get Andres back to the hospital. He has hypothermia and cardiac arrest. They discuss how best to revive him. Foreman goes with House's riskier suggestion to re-warm him quickly. Natalie wonders how Andres can't be dead given his lack of breathing and heartbeat, but Foreman explains the hypothermia would have preserved his tissues. Adams starts wondering if the patient was trying to run away, but Chase thought she was talking about the patient wanting to commit suicide. They argue about what a person should do if they become a burden to their loved ones. All of a sudden, Andres starts showing activity on the EEG. Chase tells him that when his dad left, he had to split his time between his baby sister and his alcoholic mother. His mother soon died with Chase hating her, and his sister became an alcoholic and hated Chase because he was then too busy to help her. He admits he wishes her mom had killed herself with a gun instead. Andres heart starts beating. They get the defibrillator ready and Chase manages to shock him back into sinus rhythm. Foreman tells Natalie they still have a long way to go. To keep to the terms of the bet, House calls in the asexual husband on the pretext of a free flu shot. Wilson confronts House, but House reminds him that only his patient was off limits. Wilson also reminds him that the bet was about why the woman doesn't want sex, but House's theory is that only the husband is asexual and the wife is lying about it because she loves him and wants to be with him. Wilson reminds House about the medical ethics of testing a patient on a pretext. When House counters that he's doing both of them a favor, Wilson calls him out and says he knows it's all about the bet. He accuses House of trying to destroy the relationship of two happy people. House tells Wilson he's only assumed they're happy and goes back to the husband. Andres regains consciousness and appears out of the woods. However, the patient now only speaks his native Portuguese. He starts to get upset, and his body temperature starts to rise above normal. Foreman tries to start a new differential with fever, but House tells him that the fever could be nothing more than an adverse reaction to nearly freezing to death. Chase supports House - the fever could be from necrosis set off by the freezing. House wants to restart plasmapheresis, but Foreman wants to add other neurological symptoms - loss of language and aggression. However, House puts those down to Alzheimer's. Foreman starts to question the Alzheimer's diagnosis and reminds House that the symptoms only started after he was admitted. Foreman makes a good case for encephalitis and House concedes, ordering interferon. Chase explains the new diagnosis to Natalie, but also admits that they're not sure. She says she can't take care of him anymore. House comes to Wilson in triumph - the asexual husband has high prolactin levels and has partial color blindness. This points to a tumor in the pituitary gland. This would have lowered his libido and caused erectile dysfunction. He only needs dopamine agonists and his sex drive will be restored. Wilson realizes that this will probably change the husband's whole life and accuses House of being unable to leave things alone. House counters by telling Wilson that Wilson must have known that House would not drop the matter once Wilson told him about it. Foreman starts reviewing something else - a petition to remove House's ankle monitor. Foreman goes to sign it and thinks of something. He goes to House and says that the whole fight over the patient wasn't about the patient at all - it was about the ankle monitor. He accuses House of letting him win in order to build up his confidence so he would feel in control of House and wouldn't worry about the monitor any more. House admits it and asks him to take off the monitor anyway. House notes he wins either way - either Foreman would have fallen for it and signed the forms, or would have realized House was playing him, thus proving he had House under enough control to give up on the monitor. Foreman tears up the form. House and Foreman get paged. Andres is having a heart attack. House uses the defibrillator and nearly shocks Foreman in the process. However, Andres is back into sinus rhythm. The heart attack rules out encephalitis, but Foreman still thinks the aggression and language loss are important symptoms. House starts thinking about toxins and orders an environmental scan. However, Foreman overrules him - he thinks it's meningitis and the patient's mental state has hidden the neurological symptoms He orders a test of the cerebro- spinal fluid. Foreman then admits that he couldn't resist overruling one of House's diagnoses, just like House predicted. Forbidden from doing an environmental scan, House starts talking to Natalie about possible toxins. He starts to ask her to ask Joseph to collect samples, but then overhears the patient talking Portuguese and starts a conversation with him. The patient keeps saying ‚Äúblue shack‚Äù and House asks Natalie about it. She says its where they had their first date. The patient keeps talking and, although House says it's not medically relevant, she asks that she tell her anyway. He's talking about their first date and how much he wanted to marry her. However, Andres doesn't recognize her. House asks that she get Joseph to get samples. Wilson is breaking the news to the asexual couple. He tells them as the tumor shrinks, the husband is likely to regain his sex drive. He asks what would happen if he wasn't treated. She says he needs treatment and says they will work through it. She then breaks the news she has had sex before and enjoyed it. Foreman is meeting with some donors when he looks over at some flowers he received a week ago that are still fresh. He excuses himself. He goes to House in triumph - it's Reye's syndrome. House says it's rare in adults and the wife kept all the medicine under lock and key. However, Foreman has realized that Natalie was an ex-florist who most likely used aspirin to extend the life of flowers for the few orders she still worked on. The patient probably had flu, which presented with a sore throat. He saw aspirin and started taking them and, because he forgot he took them, he probably took several. Foreman has already started the patient on steroids. Andres regains consciousness and starts speaking English again. He asks what happened to her eye and kisses her hand. Wilson tells House that he was right about the tumor. He concedes the bet. House tells him to be glad - they saved the husband's life and got the couple back on track to a healthy sex life. Wilson still thinks they were happy the way they were, even though the wife was lying about her lack of sexual desire. House sets the $100 bill on fire to light his cigar. Wilson reminds him that smoking isn't permitted, and House says neither is calling in patients on a pretext. Wilson joins House with a cigar of his own. All of a sudden, a man comes in. House hides his cigar and asks what he wants. He says he has an order to remove his ankle monitor. Chase calls his sister for the first time in several years. House goes to Foreman. Foreman knows why he's there and tells him that things work faster without training wheels. He then throws him out because he has a lot of work to do. House \\"accidentally\\" knocks over his pencil holder as he leaves. Reception The Onion's AV Club gave this episode a B+ rating. 22nd most watched program of the week Members of the asexual community and Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN) founder David Jay chastised the episode for portraying asexuality as \\"problematic and pathological\\" and having or needing a medical solution rather that presenting it as a \\"valid sexual orientation.\\" A resulting petition asked Fox Network to reconsider future portrayals of asexual characters, stating that \\"The episode encourages viewers to meet asexuality with skepticism rather than acceptance, to probe asexual people for causes of our ‚Äòcondition‚Äô rather than to accept us as a part of the natural spectrum of human sexual diversity.\\" References External links * *\\"Better Half\\" at Fox.com *Medical review of \\"Better Half\\" Category:House (season 8) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes ","title":"Better Half (House)"},{"id":"34490523","text":"To√ßi is an Albanian surname that may refer to *Fatmir To√ßi (born 1958), Albanian publisher *Irakli To√ßi (born 1981), Albanian football player *Mateos To√ßi (born 1993), Albanian football player *Terenc To√ßi (1880‚Äì1945), Albanian politician Category:Albanian-language surnames ","title":"To√ßi"},{"id":"34490525","text":"G√∂k√ßesu is a belde (town) in Mengen district of Bolu Province, Turkey.

It was designed and built by Jasmax architects, Aurecon Consulting Engineers and HEB Construction, and cost approximately $6 million, paid for by Auckland Transport and NZTA. The initial bridge works included work in the Manutewhau Walk Reserve on the eastern side of the bridge, including replacing pine trees with native trees. Initially, the main function is to provide a west‚Äìeast connection for the local area, though in the long run, it is intended to link into a future extension of the Northwestern Cycleway up to the bridge.  History  It was initially approved in the mid 2008s, as a response to a 2004 death of an 11-year-old boy hit by a van while he was crossing the motorway, and in response to continued illegal crossing over the motorway of several dozen people daily, trying to avoid long detours in reaching the nearby shopping centre west of the motorway from the suburbs to the east.

The northern part of the settlement is in the civil parish of Bradfield Combust with Stanningfield in St Edmundsbury. Bury Road is located between Hawstead and Lambs Lane / The Glebe and is two miles off the A134 between Bury St Edmunds and Sudbury. Previous names Bury Road was known as Chelisford Street in the 1567 Lawshall Survey. On the west side of Bury Road from the phone box to Rowney Farm there was a track known as Shepherdes Lane, the entrance to which was known as Shepherdes Gate. On the east side of Bury Road from Hill's Farm to The Street there was a track known as The Parson's Way. The above information was obtained from decades of research carried out by Mrs Paula Harber, and no one else! History =Catholic Mission at Coldham Cottage= The Church of Our Lady Immaculate and St Joseph, otherwise known as Coldham Cottage, is located in Bury Road near the entrance to Coldham Hall. From the time of the Reformation the history of the Catholic Mission had been closely linked to the Rookwood family and Coldham Hall. The hall itself is in the neighbouring parish of Stanningfield but the main entrance gatehouse, the avenue and the present church are in Lawshall. The Rookwoods who had been in the area since 1315, built a magnificent house in 1574 and pulled down their former residence. The new house was constructed with its \\"built-in\\" secret attic chapel, its hiding hole and escape down a chimney with an outer wall. Four years after the completion of the hall Queen Elizabeth I paid her visit to Lawshall. Efforts were made by the Rookwoods to persuade her to visit them at the hall but these were rewarded by one of the family being thrown in prison in Bury St Edmunds where he later died. The disturbances between the Roman Catholics and Protestants probably touched the village in many ways. The tale of fines and confiscations can be followed in the Rookwood records. During these difficult times the priests sometimes stayed at Coldham Hall but their names were not recorded for security. Sometimes during the late sixteenth century or early seventeenth century the attic chapel was no longer used for religious purposes. Another place was used for Mass, buried in the woods and surrounded by a moat. This second chapel was at a house named Barfords and the building, with the remains of the chapel still survives. At about this time the Rookwoods were linked with the Gage family at Hengrave Hall when Sir Thomas Gage took over Coldham Hall from his mother who was a Rookwood. His brother Fr. John Gage nearly brought the Coldham mission to an end by arranging for a good many people to travel to his new church in Bury St Edmunds. In an attempt to stop the drop in communicants at the beginning of the nineteenth century a third chapel was built at Coldham Hall. It is still there but no longer used for services. In 1865 when Fr. Patrick Rogers was priest new challenges arose when Coldham Hall was sold because of financial difficulties. Mass was said at Barfords once again until 1870 when the presbytery at Coldham Cottage was adapted and extended to form the present church. At about this time the Catholic school was moved to a site adjacent to the new church. Coldham Cottage itself dates from the late seventeenth/early eighteenth century and has a timber-frame, whitewashed and rendered, with pantile roof and brick central ridge and right end projecting stacks. A separate church was created utilising one unit of the existing house (kitchen and bedroom with removal of floor) and building on an extension. The whole represents an unusual and rare instance of continuing Catholic use from at least the eighteenth century. Following renovation work to the cottage, there is now a resident priest as well as facility to provide holiday accommodation for clergy wanting to take time off from their own parishes. The present church is now the oldest Roman Catholic Mission in Suffolk. =Coldham Cottage Roman Catholic School= Over a period of 127 years children from Roman Catholic families in Lawshall and Stanningfield were able to attend a Roman Catholic School. A school was first established in 1816 on the Coldham Hall estate, as a Catholic girls' boarding school. It moved in 1823 to Barfields, a farm building on the estate which had been adapted for use as a chapel along with a school under the care of Miss Mayston. She lived in the house next to the chapel and had the school in her best room. After the estate was sold in 1867, the school moved a year later to land adjacent to the new church at Bury Road. The land was bought for this purpose at the estate sale. The building included an upper room with a stage for theatricals. An annexe was built in 1870 and a new larger classroom added in 1933. The school remained at Bury Road until it closed in 1950. =Flight Sergeant Johannes Bartholomeus Jat Van Mesdag= A memorial stone is located on Bury Road to Flight Sergeant Johannes Bartholomeus Jat Van Mesdag, aged 21, who lost his life during the night of 6 March 1945 while flying his Mustang MK.III. It was his mother's birthday. The memorial was dedicated by All Saints Church, Lawshall on 8 November 2009 and is located near the spot where the plane came down. Prior to war breaking out Johannes was studying in the United States. During that period he lived in Ardsley, New York. He then joined the Dutch forces in Canada before being sent to the UK, arriving on 17 August 1942 and gaining his wings on the 26 November 1943. He flew with No. 64 Squadron who were based at RAF Bentwaters, Suffolk. Green Light Trust The Foundry - The Green Light Trust's headquarters in Bury Road. The Green Light Trust is an environmental and educational charity whose mission is to bring communities and landscapes to life through 'hands- on' learning and the growing of woodlands. The Trust is based at The Foundry in Bury Road. Forest for Our Children was the Trust's first Community-owned WildSpace project at Crooked Wood and Golden Wood, Lawshall. It has been the inspiration behind their many other WildSpace sites around the UK and their environmental education programmes for schools. The project includes Golden Wood, just off Bury Road, where new planting has taken place between 1994 and 2010. The Foundry is the Green Light Trust's headquarters and training centre which is set in 2.5 acres of meadowland at Bury Road. In 2006, The Foundry was awarded a prestigious RIBA Sustainability Award. Built using \\"deep green\\" construction methods, it is a carbon neutral building that is as autonomous as possible. The Foundry was originally an 1840s threshing barn that was transformed into a traction engine maintenance shed in the 1880s. It later became a forge and foundry between 1920 and 1950. Abandoned for 50 years, Green Light Trust decided to breathe new life into it and to make The Foundry their headquarters as well as a shining example of sustainable building in East Anglia. The project started on the 27 May 2005 and a year later the self- sufficient and carbon-neutral building was completed. The building is available for hire.

This piece takes a humorous look at the courtship of a Pitman and his lass where the discussion forms the proposal of marriage and the couple's plans for a life together. This song was generally considered to be one of the region's finest 'traditional' songs, one of only a handful of Tyneside songs to be appreciated outside the region in its day.

SLF combines evidence-based research with policy advocacy, communication, and on-ground execution of projects in the two areas of crash prevention as well as post-crash response. Over the past few years, SLF has facilitated the enactment of the Good Samaritan Law in India, which insulates lay rescuers of injured victims from ensuing legal and procedural hassles, adopted the Mumbai Pune Expressway- to transform it into a zero-fatality corridor, trained several thousand of Police personnel and citizens in basic life-saving techniques, and built technology platforms to assist road uses and those interested in road safety. SLF is registered as a Public Charitable Trust under the Indian Trust Act, 1886 and Sections 12A & 80G of the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961.  Background  In the past decade, over 1 million people have been killed in road crashes in India. Close to 6 million have been left seriously injured or permanently disabled. Road crashes are the single biggest killer of young people, aged 15‚Äì45 years in India. An alarming number of families have fallen into poverty after losing their primary breadwinners to road crashes. According to the 12th Report of the erstwhile Planning Commission of India, road crashes lead to an annual economic loss equivalent to 3% of India's annual GDP. In August 2013, the Supreme Court of India termed the problem of road crash deaths a \\"National Emergency\\". SLF was established to reduce the burden of death and injury due to road crashes.  History  SLF was founded on 29 February 2008 by Piyush Tewari, following the death of a young cousin in a road crash. In response to the incident, Piyush studied the issue of road safety in India and discovered the enormity of the problem. He then invited his friend and mentor Kishen Mehta to join him in setting up SLF with a mission to save lives on India's roads. SLF started by training police personnel, the first responders in most road crash cases, in basic life-saving skills. SLF then expanded its mandate to focus on a Good Samaritan Law for India, which would enable bystanders to become active rescuers by insulating them from ensuing legal and procedural hassles. On 30 March 2016, the Honorable Supreme Court of India, enacted a binding set of policies to protect Good Samaritans, in response to a public interest petition filed by SLF. More recently, SLF has played a key role in the drafting and introduction of a comprehensive Road Safety bill in the Indian parliament. SLF has further expanded its operations to include implementation of best practices on the ground. Its initiatives to make the Mumbai-Pune Expressway fatality-free by 2020 is in line with its renewed mission.  Intervention Model  To achieve its objectives, SLF operates across the four broad areas of Research, Advocacy, Communication and on-ground implementation of best practices. =Research= SLF regularly conducts primary research driven by surveys and on-ground data collection. The research feeds into SLF's activities in the areas of advocacy, public communication and on-ground implementation of best practices. Some of the research studies that have resulted in significant public interest have been listed below. Impediments to Bystander Care in India In 2013, SLF undertook India's first diagnostic study to trace the real causes which make Indian bystanders reluctant to help the victims in times of emergency. It revealed that three out of four people in India are reluctant to help road crash victims and for a majority, this reluctance stemmed from a fear of being dragged into protracted police investigations and legal hassles. This study affirmed the urgent need for unequivocal laws to support and protect Good Samaritans in India. Distracted Driving in India: A Study on Mobile Phone Usage, Pattern and Behavior SLF and Vodafone India Ltd. partnered to study the issue of distracted driving in India. the initiative aimed to understand how Indians use mobile phones while driving, to educate them about the dangers of the same, and to develop a tool to reduce incidence of distracted driving. Under this initiative, SLF undertook a national survey and published country's first of its kind report titled 'Distracted Driving in India: A Study on Mobile Phone Usage, Pattern and Behavior' which revealed that a high number of people in ten Indian cities admitted to actively using mobile phones while driving despite knowing about its ills. The study not only created conversation around the issue of distracted driving, but also recommended interventions in legislation, enforcement and education to address it. It pointed out how no specific data was being collected by the government to estimate mobile phone usage on roads and finally in 2016, for the first time, the annual publication by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways contained a table on crashes attributed to mobile phone usage in India. Road Safety in India: Public Perception Survey In 2017, SLF undertook a ten-city public perception survey to converge popular opinion on key issues of Road Safety in India, which was published at a time when the Rajya Sabha was set to discuss the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill. Among other crucial findings, the survey revealed that 6 out of 10 in the country admitted to getting license without giving a test and the same was indicated when the Minister of Road Transport and Highways initiated a debate on the same bill in Lok Sabha in April, asking how many MPs had appeared for a driving test and barely a few hands went up. The study also revealed that 8 out of 10 road users in India felt unsafe on the roads. =Advocacy= Good Samaritan Law The Law Commission of India, in its 201st Report, stated that 50% of those who die on Indian roads can be saved if they receive timely medical attention including assistance from bystanders. However, SLF undertook a survey study which found out that most bystanders in India are hesitant to help the injured due to fear of harassment and intimidation at the hands of police and hospitals. Taking cognizance of the same, SLF petitioned the Supreme Court of India to issue directions for the protection of Good Samaritans in road crash cases. On 30 March 2016, in a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court issued guidelines for the protection of Good Samaritans. By invoking Article 141 and 142 of the Constitution, the court gave these guidelines a force of law across India. Ban on trucks carrying protruding rods SLF undertook a detailed analysis of the injuries and deaths caused by trucks carrying protruding rods and found out that such protruding overloads, mainly iron rods, claimed nearly 40,000 lives and injured over 1 lakh people in 99,384 crashes in just two years. The organization then petitioned the Supreme Court to facilitate a ban on protruding rods. The petition demanded that the owner of transport company or persons hiring the vehicle and the driver may be made jointly liable under the civil and criminal law for crashes caused by such protrusions, trucks carrying iron rods and bars of pipes stationed on the road or roadside be barricaded by traffic cones and reflector tripods with visibility of 50 meters and that all states adopt uniform regulations in respect of stationary or stalled vehicles on highways. Responding to the apex court's directions in the PIL proceedings, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways deleted the provision in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 which allowed protrusions up to one meter. In August 2016, the Supreme Court finally ordered strict implementation of the ban on trucks and trailers with iron rods or pipes dangerously protruding out and also called for strict action against those trucks that are illegally parked in the middle of the roads. Stronger Road Safety Law Acknowledging the need for a comprehensive road safety law for India, SLF in March and April 2014, organized high-level consultation meetings with stakeholders from ten states to deliberate the same and develop actionable recommendations to address the identified issues. The primary recommendation from this exercise was that India needs a comprehensive Road Safety law and it was advocated that the existing Motor Vehicles Act 1988 be repealed to pave way for the new law. Subsequently, SLF's advocacy with the Government of India culminated in the Road Transport and Safety Bill, 2014. However, after several states shelved the passage of this bill, it got replaced by the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill which was recommended by SLF, and got unanimously passed by Lok Sabha, the lower house of Indian parliament, in April 2017. The Bill now awaits passage by the upper house of Indian parliament, Rajya Sabha. =Communication= In order to engage the public to improve their behavior on the road and make them aware of their rights and duties, SLF regularly carries out communication and awareness campaigns. Some are listed below. TV Campaign SLF produced a short film to increase awareness about the consequences of distracted driving. This film was a part of SLF's awareness campaign on the dangers of distracted driving and was telecast across the State of Karnataka in 2017. Print Campaign SLF has undertaken print campaigns on awareness regarding the Good Samaritan law. Radio SLF has also undertaken radio campaigns to increase seat-belt usage, and awareness around the Good Samaritan law. =Implementation= Mumbai-Pune Expressway: India's first Zero Fatality Corridor SLF with support from Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. and the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), initiated the 'Zero Fatality Corridor' project to make the expressway fatality-free by 2020. Since August 2016, over a thousand engineering errors on the expressway have been fixed. As a part of this project, the 'Safety Under 80' campaign was also jointly launched by SLF, MSRDC and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. The initiative aimed at creating mass awareness on the dangers of speeding and the consequences of speeding were exhibited through outdoor hoardings and installation of crashes cars on both the corridors of the expressway. Jeevan Rakshak Program Jeevan Rakshak is a training program focused on imparting basic life-saving skills to Police personnel as well as ordinary citizens. The program was developed by SLF in partnership with All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Over 10,000 police personnel and volunteers in over six States and Union Territories have been trained so far. ADAPT: Anticipatory Driving and Accident Prevention Training Program SLF conducts the 'Anticipatory Driving and Accident Prevention Training' program for commercial as well as regular drivers. The program uses blended learning techniques to reinforce key strategies for crash prevention. Since its inception, SLF has trained over 3,000 drivers in ten States and Union Territories across India. Online Victim Support Center Through its website, SLF provides information on safety tips, emergency response, emergency numbers and how to save a person's life under the 'Check, Call and Care' protocol. It also provides a list of organizations and schemes for post-crash care and treatment for victims including both hospital care and rehabilitation. It also developed a calculation tool which aids victims in estimating the compensation quantum and procedure in such cases. This information is available free-of-charge. Vodafone-SaveLIFE 'Road Safe' Mobile Application In 2017, SLF partnered with Vodafone India to tackle the issue of distracted driving. As part of the initiative, a mobile app 'Road Safe' was launched in April, 2017 for both Android and IOS users. The app aims to enable distraction-free driving and includes features focused on driving safely and responding to emergencies. Besides providing information on traffic fines, safety tips, nearest emergency network systems, the app has a feature called the 'Automatic Crash Detector', which employs the phone's accelerometer to detect sudden drop in vehicle speed and provides automatic voice enabled emergency response assistance.  Impact  * SLF has delivered a 30 per cent reduction in road crashes and injuries on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway from 2016 to 2017. Contribution of infrastructural factors road crashes on Mumbai-Pune Expressway brought down to near zero in 2017. * It has secured a nationwide, legally binding policy for protection of Good Samaritans who assist the injured, from ensuing legal and procedural hassles. * It has secured a ban on trucks from carrying protruding rods, expected to save close to 10,000 lives annually. * It has trained over 13,000 police personnel, high risk commercial drivers and citizen volunteers in accident prevention techniques and basic life-saving skills. * It has supported the Government of India in drafting and introducing a comprehensive road safety bill in the Indian parliament.

He was a political radical prominent in the early days of the working-class press in London, and in the debates within the Mechanics Institute movement. Early life He was born about 1787, the son of Rev. Joseph Robertson and Isobel Mathieson of Stewarton, Scotland. Rev. Joseph Robertson was Minister of Leith Wynd Chapel, Edinburgh, Scotland, but banished from Scotland for performing illegal marriages. The Mechanics' Magazine Robertson founded The Mechanics' Magazine in 1823, and edited and largely wrote it until the year of his death. It was a low-priced scientific weekly, and the first publication of its kind. To begin with he was in close alliance with Thomas Hodgskin: they had met in Edinburgh. It took advantage of a stamp tax exemption for technical weeklies not dealing in news. Robertson also devised a way of generating cheap content by an early crowdsourcing technique: letters to the editor were used without payment in continuing threads.Palmer, p. 433. In the Mechanics Magazine Robertson first proposed the London Mechanics' Institution. The idea was shortly taken out of his hands and those of Hodgskin, by a group around George Birkbeck. Robertson became a long term critic of the Institution.Kelly, pp. 77‚Äì90. Robertson's publishers John Knight and Henry Lacey attempted in 1826 to remove him from the editorship of the Magazine on the pretext of his quarrel with Birkbeck over the Institution; but Robertson had recourse to the law and his ownership of the title.Kelly, p. 96 note. In fact Robertson had been fraudulently passing letters of credit, claiming to a partner of \\"Knight, Lacey & Robertson\\", and successfully blackmailed his publishers, whose other publication the Pulpit had an evangelical readership, by threats to their reputation. Knight & Lacey became bankrupt that year, and in a complex series of events the Mechanics Magazine was published dually for a period, two versions of the same title being produced weekly. Lacey left for the USA, and Henry Kelly was brought in by Knight as a new partner. The Bankruptcy Court dealt with the matter by requiring Robertson to work on as editor, but upheld his claim to the title. By 1829, with just one more dual issue, the legal dust had settled.Palmer, p. 433‚Äì4. Railway promotion and journalism The Mechanics' Magazine covered railway inventions increasingly as the 1820s wore on, and by the end of the decade had become a partisan of the railroad lobby who were arguing against the steam carriage, which ran on the road. Drawn into the railway world, Robertson conducted the defence for John Braithwaite and John Ericsson in their patent case, on boilers, brought by Lord Cochrane and Alexander Galloway. Buoyed by the experience, he took up patents as a further profession.Palmer, p. 445. In the 1830s Robertson was a railway company promoter, initially working in 1833‚Äì4 for the London & Greenwich Railway with George Landmann and George Walter. They also employed John Herapath, a contributor to the Mechanics' Magazine, as an engineer. The subscription list was padded, and, Herapath later alleged, Robertson was responsible.Palmer, p. 446. Walter founded the Railway Magazine, having seen the potential in the Mechanics' Magazine and its railway promotion; he brought in John Yonge Akerman as its editor.Palmer, p. 447. From 1834 Robertson was working with Braithwaite promoting the Eastern Counties Railway. He had married Sophia Brooman, related to the Cobbold family of Ipswich, and the Cobbolds came in strongly to bring a railway to their part of East Anglia. Charles Blacker Vignoles as consultant engineer gave the project credibility. Matters went downhill, however, after Robertson wrote an expansive prospectus in 1834. The land deals were slow and at high premiums, with Lord Petre presenting a particular obstacle. Herapath was brought into the company, did not fit in well, and in October 1835 quarrelled spectacularly with Robertson, who exacerbated the position with Lord Petre on what appeared to be a grudge. The required Act of Parliament of 1836 nearly missed its chance.Palmer, p. 448‚Äì9. Herapath then acquired the Railway Magazine from Walter, and attacked Robertson in it; Robertson took legal action against Herapath for libel, via his publisher James Wyld.Palmer, p. 451. The founding of the Railway Times in 1837 by Braithwaite and Robertson, who began as editor, was self-defence. Robertson was undermined as Secretary in 1839, as a group based in Liverpool gained control over the company, defeating his supporters the Cobbolds.www.lner.info, History of the Great Eastern Railway's Constituent Companies. The land deal with Lord Petre hit legal obstacles in 1839, and Robertson resigned from the company on 26 February of that year. He was also caught up in a financial scandal involving his brother Thomas Duncan Robertson.Palmer, p. 453‚Äì4. Robertson ran the Mining, Railway, and Steam Navigation Gazette of the late 1830s, in parallel with his two other publications, as covert moonlighting. His editorship of the Railway Times came to an end in 1844, in a row with the owners over the highly critical anonymous contributor \\"Veritas Vincit\\", whose identity is not known; Peter Lecount or Robertson himself have been suggested as candidates,Palmer, p. 456. but the most likely was the unrelated contributor John Robertson MA. Some of the offending material appeared in the book Railway Locomotive Management, in a Series of Letters (1847) under the same pseudonym. Death Advertisement from 1847 from the Mechanics' Magazine, for Robertson & Co. Robertson was a patent agent in Fleet Street, where his firm carried on until 1892 as Robertson & Brooman. He died at Brompton on 22 September 1852 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. The London Mechanics' Institution Reading about Birkbeck's initial (1821) Mechanics' Institute in the Glasgow Free Press, Robertson early in the life of the Mechanics' Magazine put forward the idea that London should have something similar.Kelly, p. 77. In initial discussions he was conciliatory about differences between Glasgow, where the Institute had the Andersonian University to support it, and London, which would need a free- standing Institute. But on 22 November 1823 he and Hodgskin made a matter of principle of the point that accepting outside subscriptions to support the Institute would diminish the autonomy of the mechanics for which it was intended. Backed by Robert McWilliam, they lost the debate to Birkbeck and others including Francis Place, John Martineau and Richard Taylor. Robertson and Hodgskin conceded defeat by not contesting the vice-president places in the election of 15 December that set up the Institution, though McWilliam took one place.Kelly, p. 89. Robertson's reputation was damaged when subscription money was unaccounted for in November 1824, with the radical James Flather most deeply implicated. At the end of 1824, as the Institution's foundation stone was laid, Hodgskin was distancing himself from Robertson and becoming reconciled to Birkbeck.Kelly, pp. 96‚Äì7. The breach was never healed, with Robertson attacking Birkbeck in print in 1835 as having the main responsibility for the \\"ruined\\" Institution.Kelly, pp. 136‚Äì7. He also took aim at the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, which Birkbeck had scruples about joining.Kelly, p. 163. Patent reform Robertson used the pages of the Mechanics Magazine to campaign for intellectual property law reform. Starting in 1826, he tried to get a meeting on the topic at the London Mechanics' Institution, which flopped. In 1829 a parliamentary committee on patent reform was set up, after Thomas Barrett Lennard had pushed for an enquiry: Robertson lowered expectations in advance, and was partly justified by a lacklustre and scanty representation of manufacturing interests, with John Farey, Jr. providing the bulk of detailed criticism where John Taylor and Marc Brunel showed little knowledge of the system. Lennard's resulting bill ran out of time in the next session of parliament.historyofparliamentonline.org, Barrett Lennard, Thomas (1788‚Äì1856), of Belhus, Aveley, Essex and Hyde Park Terrace, Mdx. One of the grievances taken up, which reflected Robertson's own status as a patent agent in private practice, was that officials within the Patent Office also acted as agents. The Mechanics Magazine favoured prison for them. In fact the profession was close to a closed shop in the 1820s, with the insiders Moses Poole and William Carpmael virtually cornering the business, and Robertson the only newcomer. Another bill by Richard Godson and Benjamin Rotch, of 1833, was disliked by Robertson. He himself gave evidence before the Ewart Committee of 1835 on industrial design, and the House of Commons committee on patent law in 1849. The Trades Newspaper In 1825 John Limbird was interested in founding a Mechanics' Newspaper with Robertson. The project was diverted by the intervention of John Gast's committee, becoming the Trades Newspaper of 1825 to 1827.Topham, p. 83. Robertson was squared by being made editor, a decision unacceptable to Francis Place, who thought Robertson was not to be trusted, and wanted Edward Baines. In radical politics, Robertson and Hodgskin actually differed in their analysis. When Labour Defended, Hodgskin's landmark pamphlet, was reviewed in the Newspaper in 1825, there was a note of dissent from Robertson on fixed capital. This attitude diminished the ground on which Hodgskin was innovative. On the other hand, his ideas were quickly spread through the paper. Place attacked Robertson in consequence, in the Artizan. Works Robertson wrote Lives of Eminent Scotsmen (1821). Lives of the Scottish Poets (1821‚Äì22) has also been attributed to him. As a man of letters, Robertson is known for The Percy Anecdotes, 20 vols. London, 1821‚Äì3 (subsequent editions 1830, 1868, 1869, and various American editions). The volumes, which came out in forty-four monthly parts, were supposedly written by Sholto and Reuben Percy: Reuben was Thomas Byerley, and Sholto was Robertson. The so-called \\"Brothers Percy\\" had met to discuss the work at the Percy coffee-house in Rathbone Place in Fitzrovia, from which the work took its name. Sir Richard Phillips later claimed that the original idea arose from his suggestion, made to John Mayne and Alexander Tilloch, to file the anecdotes which had appeared in The Star newspaper over the years. The Percys compiled a collection of anecdotes, on a similar plan. Their success, which was a publishing phenomenon, was as a collection of \\"gobbets\\" suitable for social small-talk, or what in modern parlance would be a bluffer's guide to appearing well read. Lord Byron called them indispensable.Topham, p. 91. The two collaborators began a series of Percy Histories, or interesting Memorials of the Capitals of Europe, but this got no further than London, 1823, in 3 vols. Robertson also started in 1828, as Sholto Percy, an abridgment of the Waverley Novels. References * *J. E. C. Palmer (edited by H. W.

Its objectives are to represent the 10,000 landowners with traditional land around the Porgera Gold Mine and serve as a pressure group on behalf of the landowners, and to pursue landowner claims in the courts in Port Moresby. The PLOA is funded by royalties from the mine, so that the mine pays for the institution established to oppose it. Porgera Gold Mine was built by Vancouver-based Placer Dome, and began operations in 1990. It is one of the world's top ten gold mines, producing over 16 million ounces up to 2009. The mine, which is operated by Porgera Joint Venture (PJV), has been 95% owned by Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corporation following Barrick's takeover of Placer Dome in 2006.Porgera Gold Mine Funding 2% of the mine's total sales, less selling expenses, are paid out as royalties to the provincial government and various local bodies. The PLOA receives 12% of the mine's royalties. Since 2005 the PLOA has received: * 2004 PGK3.1 million [$1 million] * 2005 PGK2.8 million [$868,000] * 2006 PGK2.2 million [$700,000] * 2007 PGK2.5 million [$875,000] * 2008 PGK3.6 million [$1.4 million] * 2009 PGK3.6 million [$1.7 million] * 2010 PGK4.2 million [$2 million] The 2011 royalty is expected to be greater due to higher gold prices. Leadership The office holders of the PLOA are elected by one representative of each of the 24 sub-clans that own traditional land in and around PJV's mining area. At a special meeting of the PLOA in July 1995, Mark Ekepa was elected as Chairman of the PLOA, and he has been the Chairman ever since. Originally the Chairman was supposed to be subject to an annual election. In January 2001 Ekepa was re-elected Chairman and he changed the constitution so that an election was only required every five years. Advocacy activities The PLOA has been the most vocal critic of PJV's mining activities. Mark Ekepa characterises his role as a David and Goliath struggle with Barrick Gold. Since 2007 he has travelled every year to Barrick's Annual General Meeting in Toronto, Canada, to protest against environmental and human rights abuses by PJV, though he missed the 2011 meeting due to flight delays. Ekepa's main objective is to force the mine to pay for a mass relocation of every member of the community who lives within the immediate area of the mine. In 2008 the PLOA formed the Porgera Alliance, an umbrella body, to seek justice for human rights and environmental abuse, both in Porgera and the country as a whole. In April 2009 Mark Ekepa travelled to Port Moresby with the stated intention of meeting the Prime Minister Michael Somare, in order to withdraw the PLOA's support for the police deployment to Porgera. The police had allegedly burnt down 300 houses belonging to local landowners. On behalf of the landowners, Paulus Dowa Lawyers threatened to sue the National Police Commissioner Gari Baki and the Minister of Internal Security Sambi Rambi for destruction of property. Mark Ekepa met James Cameron, the director of the science fiction film Avatar, in New York City in 2010. Cameron said to Ekepa that the film was premised on ‚Äòthe struggles of people like yours‚Äô. The PLOA, supported by an international non-profit organisation MiningWatch Canada, launched a complaint in March 2011 against Barrick Gold and PJV with the Canadian National Contact Point, the mediator for breaches of OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. The complaint alleges that living conditions amongst the community around the mine are incompatible with OECD guidelines, that PJV's private security staff have abused and killed members of the community, and that public security forces have evicted and destroyed homes. The complaint also raises concerns about the mine's riverine tailings disposal, and the mine's impact on air quality. The Canadian National Contact Point has informally met both sides, and both sides have agreed to enter into mediation. Controversies =Patricide= Mark Ekepa reportedly shot his father in the head at close range in 1996 during a public argument over mine compensation money. The killing meant that Ekepa took his father's place as one of the most important tribal leaders in Porgera, and that he was able to take control of the PLOA. Ekepa was never convicted for killing his father. =Financial transparency= Since becoming Chairman of the PLOA in 1995, Mark Ekepa has become a wealthy individual. He has property, businesses, and has a reputation for buying new cars. While Ekepa has become a voice on the global stage, those in the Porgera community distrust him due to the PLOA's lack of financial transparency. The PLOA continually refuses to publish its accounts, despite considerable efforts by landowners to access this information. Many landowners have complained that the leadership of the PLOA have been embezzling royalty payments that should otherwise benefit ordinary landowners. In 2000 a visiting anthropologist from the University of Chicago recorded that the PLOA had received PGK5.5 million [$2.1 million] in royalties from PJV during the previous six years, and that only PGK300,000 [$114,000] remained in the PLOA bank accounts, whilst there was no record of how the rest of the money had been spent. The head of the Porgera Development Authority had asked PricewaterhouseCoopers to look at the PLOA's books. =Misappropriation charges= In April 2005 Mark Ekepa was arrested by police in Mount Hagen on charges of misappropriation. He was released on bail of PGK5,000 [$1,600]. In March 2005 this issue had come to the attention of Prime Minister Sir Michael Somare, who wrote to Government Secretary Joshua Kalinoe complaining that the mine royalties were being hijacked by third parties and middlemen. =Rivalries= When Mark Ekepa was elected the PLOA Chairman in 1995 he had defeated fellow Porgeran William Gaupe. Twice Mark Ekepa had to defend his leadership of the PLOA in Papua New Guinea's National Court, first in 2000, and again in 2004, when William Gaupe had been elected the new Chairman of the PLOA at a special community meeting. Ekepa overturned Gaupe's election victory in the National Court. William Gaupe was popular in Porgera for having led a gang raid on PJV's drilling contractor in 1987, when he stole a safe containing cash and all the passports of the expatriate workers, and was chased by PJV's helicopter up the mountain. Gaupe gave himself up to the police and served two years in prison. In 2005 Ekepa was criticised by a rival Porgeran leader for never having called for the government to investigate suspected community deaths on the mine site. Jonah Pilah Kipu, the chairman of a Porgera youth association, said that Ekepa had only first spoken out about the issue - some 21 suspected deaths over 15 years - after being arrested by the police on charges of misappropriation. Some Porgerans allege that Ekepa maintains his control of the PLOA by rigging the organisation's elections. =International NGOs= International NGOs, which fund Mark Ekepa's annual trips to North America, have been criticised for legitimising Ekepa by their association with him.

He graduated in 1987 from Concordia University, Montreal. He lived in Canada and France before returning in his country. Srouji developed a technique of burning holes in his paintings after having participated to numerous workshops in America and Europe, including the Triangle Arts Trust. He currently teaches at the Lebanese American University. Life and work Srouji's art deals with his nostalgia for Lebanon, as he emigrated at the beginning of the Lebanese Civil War. At the beginning of the war, Srouji served as Red Cross volunteer in Southern Lebanon, an experience he later compared to horror movies. He ultimately escaped from Sidon by boat to Cyprus before emigrating to Canada. Shortly after the end of the war, Srouji traveled back to Lebanon to try to pick up the pieces. Hanibal Srouji became known for using a blow-torch to create small hales and lines. His paintings remind one of bullet-marked walls of crippled buildings in Beirut and encompass the human emotions in the aftermath of the civil war. Another series has been dominated by vertical lines that represent the bars of a cage, as signs of confinement, but can also be read as bars of a musical composition. Although Srouji is considered as an abstract painter, his recent work, Terre/Mer (\\"land/sea\\"), evoked landscapes.

Taking a job at the gym, she persuaded the gym owner to teach her boxing. Subsequently, she attended a dojo and learned karate and other martial arts. Judy also learnt how to use a knife from a boyfriend connected to the mafia. After trying a number of different knives she settled on a stiletto and became a vigilante. Judy's alter-ego, the Black Stiletto, was active for five years in New York and Los Angeles between 1958-1962 and then mysteriously disappeared. Since that time, the vigilante's image and mystique was exploited by the media in comics, films, and action figures. \\"Who was the Black Stiletto?\\" became a catch-question like \\"Who shot JFK?\\" Release and reception  The Black Stiletto was released in the US on 5 September 2011. As part of the promotional process for the novel, a free downloadable teaser short story, \\"The Black Stiletto's Autograph\\" was made available on the official website. Reviewing The Black Stiletto, academic Dr Wesley Britton noted that \\"verisimilitude is one strength of what could have been just a comic-book romp without pictures\\" and that because of this, the novel was \\"a fast read, you don‚Äôt have to be a feminist to enjoy this fresh approach to super-heroes\\". Britton also commented on Benson's abilities, saying that he \\"is a master of description and pacing, so every page is both believable and tightly sketched. While this novel is self-contained, Benson leaves open a number of questions and threads so that at least one sequel is inevitable.\\" The reviewer for Popcorn Reads considered that \\"The writing ... is so well done that it flows beautifully for the reader\\", going on to say that the finished product is \\"a completely believable suspense novel\\". Overall the reviewer acknowledged that they \\"completely enjoyed every minute of this fast-paced novel ... WooHoo! A new series to look forward to!\\" Library Journal described the book favorably as a \\"mashup of the work of Gloria Steinem, Ian Fleming, and Mario Puzo, all under the editorship of Stan Lee.\\" Booklist gave the novel a starred review, calling it \\"prime escapism.\\" The novel's sequel, The Black Stiletto: Black & White, was published in May 2012. The third book, The Black Stiletto: Stars & Stripes was published April 2013. The final two books in the saga, The Black Stiletto: Secrets & Lies and The Black Stiletto: Endings & Beginnings, were published in January and November 2014, respectively. Benson has also made available a free teaser short story, \\"The Black Stiletto's Autograph\\", and a \\"Black Stiletto Song\\" (by Will Arrington), both of which can be downloaded from the official website.

Biography  B√∂rjesson, painted by Constantin Hansen Italian Woman at the Well (Taormina) Her father, Johan B√∂rjesson, was a pastor and playwright. Her mother was a member of the noble Fock family. In 1849, she became one of the first four women admitted to the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts and, from 1852 to 1853, studied with Constantin Hansen, who had recently spent a decade working in Italy. From 1854 to 1856, she studied with the portrait and history painter, Johan Christoffer Boklund. In 1857, she completed her studies with Benjamin Vautier, an exponent of the D√ºsseldorf School. After spending some time in Paris, she went to Italy in 1865, inspired by her time with Hansen. She returned to D√ºsseldorf, briefly, for some private lessons with Wilhelm Sohn. She settled in Rome, and for a time lived with her friend, the painter Sofie Ribbing. Eventually she decided to stay in Italy, although she continued to send her works to Sweden, and, until 1880, participated in exhibitions at the Royal Academy, of which she became a member in 1872. She also had a showing at the 1873 Vienna World's Fair. Many of her paintings were created en plein aire. In the latter part of her career, she adopted the Divisionist style. She spent long periods in Venice and on Sicily, as well as making short visits to Spain and Morocco. During her last three years, she lived in Liguria. Her works may be seen at the G√∂teborgs konstmuseum and the Nationalmuseum. References  Further reading  * Carin √ñsterberg, et al., Svenska kvinnor: f√∂reg√•ngare, nyskapare.

Chase was elected to two terms as mayor of Haverhill, Massachusetts on the Social Democratic ticket. He is considered the first socialist to elected mayor of an American city.Frederic C. Heath, Social Democracy Red Book. Terre Haute, IN: Debs Publishing Co., 1900; p. 108. He later ran without success as a Socialist candidate for Governor of Massachusetts and New York, and as a Congressional candidate in Ohio and West Virginia. Early life John Calvin Chase was born in Gilmanton, New Hampshire on May 27, 1870 to a working class family. When John was just 1 year old the family moved to the small town of Ossipee, where his father Levi M. Chase met with an accident that caused his death.Frederic C. Heath, Social Democracy Red Book. Terre Haute, IN: Debs Publishing Co., 1900; pg. 108. John and his four siblings were left in the care of his mother Lynthia, who relocated to yet another small New Hampshire town, this time Milton Mills to work in the woolen mills there. John followed his mother into the mills, going to work for the first time at the age of just 9 years old. The family relocated frequently in search of steady work, living also in Sanford, Maine and Barnstead, New Hampshire. At the age of 13 he went to work in a shoe factory for the first time.William D.P. Bliss (ed.), \\"John C. Chase,\\" in The New Encyclopedia of Social Reform, Including All Social-Reform Movements and Activities, and the Economic, Industrial, and Sociological Facts and Statistics of All Countries and All Social Subjects. New Edition. New York: Funk and Wagnalls Co., 1908; pg. 161. He joined the Boot and Shoe Workers' Union in 1888 and was subsequently elected as a delegate to that organization's annual convention. Chase moved to the town of Haverhill, Massachusetts in 1890 to work in a shoe factory there. Chase's trade union activities soon lead to his being made unemployable in the shoe industry, so he instead helped to establish a cooperative grocery store in Haverhill, which provided him a source of work. Political career Chase was a member of the People's Party (the so-called \\"Populists\\") during the first half of the 1890s.Henry F. Bedford, Socialism and the Workers in Massachusetts, 1886-1912. Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press, 1966; pg. 27. In 1894, Haverhill's Populists joined a broad reform coalition with the Socialist Labor Party of America, the Prohibition Party, and other unaffiliated progressives, running a slate of candidates for city office. John Chase was one of the nominees of this coalition for city office. In the aftermath of the 1894 campaign Chase himself joined the Socialist Labor Party, joining a new Haverhill local established by the organization.Bedford, Socialism and the Workers in Massachusetts, 1886-1912, pg. 31. Chase was soon a committed member of that Marxist party, running for Massachusetts Attorney General on the SLP ticket in the election of 1896.Bedford, Socialism and the Workers in Massachusetts, 1886-1912, pg. 58. Local Haverhill SLP had objections to the national organization's policy of dual unionism towards the established unions of the American Federation of Labor. In February 1898 Chase returned Section Haverhill's SLP charter to the national office in New York City, thereby ending its connection with the party.Bedford, Socialism and the Workers in Massachusetts, 1886-1912, pg. 73. The following month Chase was acting as organizer of a new Haverhill local of the Social Democratic Party of America, an organization headed by Victor L. Berger and Eugene V. Debs.Bedford, Socialism and the Workers in Massachusetts, 1886-1912, pp. 76-77. Chase quickly accumulated 60 membership applications for the new organization, thereby transforming the former Section Haverhill SLP into Local Haverhill SDP.Bedford, Socialism and the Workers in Massachusetts, 1886-1912, pg. 77. =Mayor of Haverhill= Following a defeat in the November 1898 campaign for the Massachusetts State Senate, in which he finished second in a field of four candidates,\\"Vote at Haverhill,\\" Social Democratic Herald [Belleville, IL], vol. 1, no. 22 (Dec. 3, 1898), pg. 4. the next month Chase headed the SDP ticket as the party's candidate for mayor of Haverhill, emerging victorious by a plurality of 356 votes.\\"One Victory Followed by Another,\\" Social Democratic Herald, vol. 1, no. 23 (Dec. 10, 1898), pg. 1. Chase thus became the first socialist elected mayor of an American city. Chase was joined in elected office by three newly elected Socialist aldermen as members of the Haverhill Common Council.Patricia Trainor O'Malley, \\"James Francis Carey,\\" in Mark C. Carnes (ed.), American National Biography: Supplement 2. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005; pg. 76. This success was tempered by the fact that the Haverhill Common Council had 21 members at the time, relegating the socialists to a minority position in the civic government.Ira Kipnis, The American Socialist Movement, 1897-1912. New York: Columbia University Press, 1952; pg. 76. Although formerly a shoe factory worker, by the early 1900s Chase was the proprietor of a newsstand in Haverhill. (1901 ad.) The 1898 SDP program for Haverhill called for establishment of the initiative and referendum, municipal ownership of public utilities, public works jobs for unemployed workers, elimination of unguarded railway crossings, and free clothing for poor children so that they would be able to attend school.Bedford, Socialism and the Workers in Massachusetts, 1886-1912, pg. 68. Chase's mayoral victory as the first socialist mayor in America captured the imagination of the left wing press. Julius Wayland, editor of the weekly Appeal to Reason declared that \\"the mere casting of these 2500 votes has done more to direct attention to Socialism than could have been done with any other means.\\"Quoted in Howard H. Quint, The Forging of American Socialism: Origins of the Modern Movement: The Impact of Socialism on American Thought and Action, 1886-1901. Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press, 1953; pp. 324-325. Paul Tyner of the news magazine The Arena offered the hope that Chase's victory would usher in a series of local victories for the socialist movement in the country.Quint, The Forging of American Socialism, pg. 324. Chase was re-elected as mayor of Haverhill in 1899, defeating a so-called \\"fusion\\" candidate jointly nominated by the Democratic and Republican Parties. He was defeated in another bid for reelection in the 1900 election, however. =Socialist Party= In the summer of 1901 the Social Democratic Party merged with another organization of the same name and smaller groups to form the Socialist Party of America (SPA). Chase was elected the first Secretary of Local Haverhill SPA at the time of its formation.\\"A Remarkable Growth,\\" Appeal to Reason [Girard, KS], whole no. 311 (Nov. 16, 1901), pg. 3. Not long after, Chase was named a national organizer and lecturer for this organization, traveling the country and speaking on the new party's behalf. In 1902 and 1903 Chase was named the Socialist Party's candidate for governor of Massachusetts.Lawrence Kestenbaum, \\"Index to Politicians: Chase,\\" The Political Graveyard, www.politicalgraveyard.com/ Chase captured more than 8.4% of the votes cast during the first of these campaigns and almost 6.4% in the second effort.\\"John C. Chase,\\" Our Campaigns, www.ourcampaigns.com/ =Later political activity= Chase was later elected State Secretary of the Socialist Party of New York, the New York state affiliate of the SPA. In 1906 Chase was selected to head the Socialist Party ticket as its candidate for governor of New York. He received 21,751 votes in this effort, nearly 1.5% of the total ballots cast. Chase ran for U.S. Congress three times as a Socialist, running in the 14th District of Ohio in 1920. Death and legacy John C.

Education and Personal Life  Gabbai holds a Bachelor Degree in Economics (magna cum laude) and Law (cum laude), and an MBA in Finance (cum laude) from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. After completing his undergraduate degree he joined the Israel Democracy Institute and served as an assistant on behalf of the Knesset Economics Committee. Gabbai did his internship at the law firm S. Horowitz and with of Justice Dalia Dorner of the Israel Supreme Court. He is married to Einat, a clinical psychologist, and is a father to five. His first wife died when their daughter was three-years-old. They live in Modi'in.  Career  Gabbai's public service career began in 1996, after completing his graduate degree in Business Administration, when he was appointed as the advisor to Justice Minister Tzachi Hanegbi. Gabbai served in that capacity until 1998, when he was appointed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to head the economics division of the Prime Minister's Office. After Netanyahu's loss in the May 1999 elections, Gabbi entered the private market, serving as Vice President of Business Development and International Relations at Bezeq International under CEO Uri Yogev from 1999-2001. In 2002 he returned to public service and was appointed Director of the Government Companies Authority and served there until 2007, under Prime Ministers Ariel Sharon, Ehud Olmert and Benjamin Netanyahu. This period was characterized by vigorous privatization of state companies, including El Al, Bezeq, Israel's Oil Refineries and Zim, selling shares in a total value of 14b NIS in an unprecedented privatization spree. Other changes he instituted included the splitoff of Israel Railways from the Ports and Railways Authority and its transformation into a government company, as well as making the Postal Authority and the Government Department of Public Works an auxiliary unit of government companies. After leaving the Government Companies Authority, Gabbai was appointed director of the Israeli branch of the investment fund Babcock & Brown. The branch had been negotiating to acquire advanced CHIC Company Canadian holdings Franchisee Route 6 throughout the country. The value of Route 6 was estimated at 300-400 million dollars, but at the end of negotiations no business deal was reached. During this time, the global economic crisis broke out and the value of Australian companies had deteriorated as well as the value of its holdings in Israel. In light of the difficult financial situation of the parent company, Gabbai recommended the closure of the Israeli branch, which closed in late 2008. During his role he studied the Israeli branch infrastructure and the tenders participation, Sorek desalination and a solar power plant construction Ashalim. Additionally, he also negotiated the purchase of controlling interest in Gama Management & Clearing, but it was sold to Phoenix Holdings Ltd.  Service in the Israeli Prime Minister‚Äôs Office  Gabbai is very close to Netanyahu in the last 15 years and the relationship between them seems to be founded on mutual appreciation and friendship. Gabbai was appointed Director-General of the Israeli Prime Minister's Office in May 2009 by the Israeli government. As the most senior representative in the office, he ran all the economic, social and internal affairs of the government on behalf of the prime minister, with special involvement in the energy, infrastructure, water, real estate, and finance sectors. As such, Gabbai was Netanyahu's designated representative to make decisions about a number of significant socioeconomic issues. The first was the Bank of Israel Law, where a dispute between the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Israel Governor Prof. Stanley Fischer prevented its submission to the Knesset. Gabbai's formulated intervention was submitted by the government to the Knesset and thus paved the way for approval of law and the extension of Fisher's tenure to a second term. A year and a half later Gabbai was again involved in a confrontation with the director of the Finance Ministry, Ilan Levin, about the lawyers' strike. After forty days, Netanyahu decided to intervene and put Gabbai in charge of ending it. Levin refused the outline presented by Gabbai on behalf of the government, and Supreme Court President Dorit Beinish ordered that the conflict be resolved with arbitration. Gabbai‚Äôs position was eventually accepted by Beinish. Gabbai's decision, backed Netanyahu, has been criticized for damaging wages and economic repercussions. Gabbai was also tasked with leading the project of building a natural gas pipeline to Haifa. Due to the concentration of factories in the Haifa district, it was also important to switch over to natural gas and thereby reduce air pollution, morbidity and mortality in the region. The pipeline, together with infrastructure of the Valley Railroad and Highway 6, were designed to pass through the Druze lands in the Kishon Region. Due to internal office differences and contradictory promises given to landowners on - by the ministers, the gas pipeline had been delayed since 2006. Gabbai was repeatedly appointed by Netanyahu to head teams and committees set up to solve public controversies and find economic solutions. Over the course of his term Gabbai headed dozens of committees dealing with central economic issues such as the reforms in planning and construction, removing obstructions in the Israel Lands Administration, the water crisis, examining the concentration of economic control and the Trajtenberg Committee. Netanyahu took advantage of Gabbai's administrative ability and good nature and let him handle \\"hot potatoes\\" that came his way. even when international stories took place, Gabbai was called by Netanyahu to turn down the fire: Netanyahu put out a statement saying he would set up a committee headed by the director-general of his office, Eyal Gabbai, to investigate the unfolding of events, which led to the announcement during US Vice President Joe Biden‚Äôs trip of plans to build 1,600 housing units in northeastern Jerusalem during the Biden visit, and come up with regulations to prevent a similar occurrence in the future. During his work on Gabbai aroused a public storm when he delivered a public speech saying: \\"'Druze' has become a word that terrifies ministries\\". Gabbai quickly apologized, but the Druze community demanded his suspension. Despite this, Gabbai continued to formulate a land swap. His solution was received enthusiastically by the Prime Minister and the government, but the Druze withdrew from the agreement.  Business Sector  After retiring from the PM's Office, Gabbai was appointed as a Chairman of Continuing Education Fund For Teachers Ltd, which has AUM of ~ 18bNIS. Gabbai was appointed by the District Court as Financial Expert in IDB Holding's debt settlement process. Gabbai acted as a very active Expert. He pushed for public tender over IDB, which up till then, was not a common practice under Israeli Law. At the end of the bidding Eduardo Elsztain Group Won and Gabbai was again appointed by the Court, this time, as Trustee for implementation of the Debt Arrangement and the control transfer to the new owner.

Interactions with ankyrin-G (ankyrin-3) are crucial to the localisation of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) at the axon initial segment and for neurons to initiate action potentials. This conserved 9-amino acid motif ((V/A)P(I/L)AXXE(S/D)D) is required for ankyrin-G binding and functions to localise sodium channels to a variety of 'excitable' membrane domains both inside and outside of the nervous system. This motif has also been identified in the potassium channel 6TM proteins KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 that correspond to the M channels that exert a crucial influence over neuronal excitability. KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels are preferentially localised to the surface of axons both at the axonal initial segment and more distally, and this axonal initial segment targeting of surface KCNQ channels is mediated by these ankyrin-G binding motifs of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3. KCNQ3 is a major determinant of M channel localisation to the AIS, rather than KCNQ2.

The system is based on 6 bike stations, respectively staffed by two employees in two shifts. Ecovolis program has proven successful in significantly increasing bicycle use in Tirana. History Initially the Tirana Community Bicycle Albania project was supported from PASS organization and the US-based Pedal for Progress organization, which donated 450 bicycles. Sixty of these were used road bikes, which were modified and painted by local technicians to serve as public bikes in the Ecovolis scheme. In 2014, Ecovolis participated in European Mobility Week.[European Mobility Week 2014 European Mobility Week Opens: Our Streets, Our Choice\\"]. Low Carbon Sustainable Homeland. System Ecovolis Bicycle sharing scheme. Each Ecovolis station is staffed by two employees in two shifts and contains 30 ‚Äì 60 bicycles. As of 2014, four stations are in operation in Tirana, and about 2000 people have subscribed. \\"Tirana fights to beat its addiction to cars and get its residents cycling\\" The Guardian.In order to use the bicycles it is required to provide a personal identification document (such as passport or ID card) or by subscribing to the Ecovolis membership Card. The bicycle is equipped with a front bicycle basket, a behind carrier, a comfortable saddle and a public fender with the Ecovolis sign. The bicycle stations also provide touristic information to the visitors and a list of the city attractions. Moreover, being a non-profit social enterprise, during particular days the program offers free bicycle service, cycling courses, donations of bicycles and helmets for children in need, bike tours and a bicycle recycle program. Payment The program operates in two ways: through membership subscription or a personal identification document (such as passport or ID card). Individuals registered with the program identify themselves with the Ecovolis membership card at any bicycle station. For visitors, the cost is about $1.00 per day.\\"3 Dangerous Places Worth Visiting\\". Student Travel Planning Guide.

Adrien Manglard studied with Fergioni in Rome. Claude Joseph Vernet, too, was welcomed in his atelier sometime after his arrival in Rome in 1732. Among his other pupils were Andrea Locatelli,Michel, Olivier (2003). \\"Locatelli, Andrea\\". Grove Art Online. and Paolo Anesi. Biography Fergioni was born in Rome on January 2, 1674, although some dated sources mistakenly report is year of birth as 1675. He was baptized on January 9, in the no longer extant church of San Nicola degli Incoronati, formerly located close by the Carceri Nuove, in the Regola rione of Rome. His mother, Margherita Bottoni, was from Montegiorgio, nearby Fermo. His father was a sbirro (17th-century policeman) from Sant'Angelo del Pesco. Fergioni's nickname Sbirretto, which is oftener used to refer to him than his actual surname, derives from his father's profession. While virtually unknown today, Fergioni was appreciated by his contemporaries. In the late 1710s he was included in the Abecedario pittorico by P. A. Orlandi, who recorded information on the painter given to him by Giuseppe Ghezzi. Fergioni wrote a letter in 1719 to thank Orlandi for his inclusion in the Abecedario (the letter is today in the Archiginnasio of Bologna, manuscript B. 153, n. 82). Another biography, richer in details, on Fargioni was completed by Nicola Pio in 1724. Fergioni was born to a family of modest means, but was nonetheless able to devote himself to the study of literature, honing his skills as an orator and a poet up to his twenties. Fergioni began to paint for pleasure, seeking advise on the best painting technique among his contemporaries. He started by copying opera of other famous painters, such as Mattia Preti, Giacinto Brandi and Guercino. After meeting German painter Philipp Peter Roos, he started following his style, and thus became an animal painter. Fergioni later started on a journey to Tuscany, sojourning in Siena, where he got a job, and then in Leghorn. There, he studied under an unknown master, Mons√π Alto, who imparted on him a more realist and naturalist approach, and allowed him to build himself a repertoire of forms. He returned to Rome as marine landscape painter. There he received commissions by the Gabrielli family, as well as by clients from Genoa and Taggia. Probably around 1711, Fergioni painted an Annunziata for the church of San Martino in Faldignano, near Cascia, Umbria. The painting is now lost. View of Messina, Bernardino Fergioni Ghezzi exposed paintings by Fergioni at San Salvatore in Lauro, which he considered quite beautiful, on two occasions, in 1716 and 1717. These were a marine view with many figures, property of the Falconieri family, and a view of the harbor of Messina. More paintings by Fergioni are recorded in notarial documents. These include Due grandi marine bislonghe (Arch. di Stato di Roma, 30 Notai capitolini, Office 25, envelope 559), property of Filippo Antonelli in 1732; Una marina (ibid., Office 14, envelope 430), property of Andrea Marilli in 1760; Due piccoli paesini (Ibid., Not. d. Tribunale d. Auditor Camerae, envelope 4392) property of Giuseppe Sardi in 1771. According to Lanzi, two French painters overshadowed Fergioni's fame in the early 18th century, that is Manglard and Vernet, who arrived in Rome in 1715 and 1734, respectively. According to Lanzi, Vernet wasn't warmly welcomed in Manglard's studio, and so moved on to Fergioni's before going sur les ports de mer ... faire ses √©tudes. However, Vernet probably studied first with Fergioni, to then move to Manglard's. Fergioni experienced a modest financial success and a more consistent social one in his lifetime. His father bequeathed to him his furniture and about thirty paintings, together with the obligation of providing for his family via his up-and-down job as a painter (Fergioni was given the burden of providing for the family through le di lui industrie e con la di lui virt√π e fatiche nella professione di pittore). On the other hand, Fergioni was awarded a Knight Cross by Pope Benedict XIII, which he \\"flaunted continuously.\\" Fergioni married Anna Maria Moscatelli on December 14, 1722. The marriage produced no offspring. Fergioni died in Rome in 1738.

The company ceased production in 1964.Murray (2000), pp. 100 and 103. History V√©tra was founded in 1925 and was based in Paris. After initially experimenting with production of accumulator railcars, the company made its first trolleybus in 1927. The first V√©tra trolleybuses were two vehicles, model MV, supplied to the Aubagne‚ÄìCuges trolleybus system, which was located just east of Marseille and began operation on 22 September 1927.Murray, p. 65. In the decades that followed, V√©tra had a near-monopoly on French trolleybus production. Trolleybus systems operating in France also bought their fleets nearly exclusively from V√©tra. From the 1930s through the 1950s, the \\"overwhelming majority\\"Murray, p. 23. of trolleybuses in use on French systems were built by V√©tra. On a smaller scale, the company also sold trolleybuses to systems located in other countries. The traction motors and other electrical equipment in V√©tra trolleybuses were supplied by Alsthom (now called Alstom) in all or nearly all cases, while many mechanical parts, often including chassis, came from Berliet. The vehicle bodies were fabricated by various different companies, Berliet included. In its 38 years of trolleybus production, the company made no less than 31 different models. Some were only small variations on another model. For example, the VBRh was basically the same as the VBR except was 2.9 m tall instead of 2.7 m, and the h suffix in the model number stood for \\"haute\\" (high).Buisson, Christian (March‚ÄìApril 1988). \\"The Paris Trolleybuses: Part 2\\". Trolleybus Magazine No. 158, pp. 32‚Äì42. National Trolleybus Association (UK). . A 1957 V√©tra VBF-model trolleybus in Grenoble in 1965. This vehicle originally served the Paris trolleybus system. Models produced included both two-axle and three-axle rigid vehicles, with large numbers of each. In its history, V√©tra only built one articulated trolleybus. This was a prototype for Algiers, Algeria. Built in 1950/51, it was designated model VA4.SR and had four axles, three in the front section and one in the trailing section. It was tested on the Paris trolleybus system in January 1951. This prototype was unsuccessful, and it was eventually rebuilt into a three-axle rigid vehicle.Murray, p. 90. V√©tra also made some freight vehicles for a non-passenger trolleytruck line between Villey-Saint- √âtienne and Varang√©ville, France. It also built small electric locomotives for use on mine railways. In 1961 Pegaso, the Spanish truck and bus maker, reached an agreement with Vetra to launch to the Spanish market a Pegaso trolleybus, called model 8010, based on Vetra technology. The operation, however, was a failure, due to the contemporary import to Spain of several tenths of ex- London Transport BUT units; and only one Pegaso 8010, with a Seida body, was ever built. By the early 1960s, several French trolleybus systems had closed, and most of those that remained were destined to close within a few years, so were not purchasing new trolleybuses. Facing a steep decline in orders, V√©tra filed for bankruptcy. Production ended in 1964, with the completion of an order for two VBH85 trolleybuses for Fribourg, Switzerland. Customers V√©tra sold trolleybuses to transit systems in 12 different countries, on three continents, including as far away as Chile. However, the majority were sold to systems in France. The overall total was in excess of 1,750, a quantity that has been matched or exceeded by only very few other trolleybus manufacturers.Murray (2000), various pages. =Europe= The Lyon trolleybus system purchased by far the largest number of V√©tra trolleybuses of any system, a total of 372, comprising seven different models. Other large buyers in France were Marseille (145, of seven different models), Paris (133), St. Etienne (78), and Limoges (43). After the closure of the Paris system, in 1966, its 38 VBF trolleybuses were sold to the Grenoble system, and 40 of its VBRh trolleybuses were sold to Limoges;Priestley, John (January 1979). \\"The French Trolleybus Scene, Part 2\\". Trolleybus Magazine No. 104, pp. 11‚Äì22. 24 of the latter entered service there, and some remained in service until 1989.Trolleybus Magazine No. 168 (Nov.-Dec. 1989), p. 147. National Trolleybus Association (UK). Other European countries where V√©tra found buyers were Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Spain and Switzerland. Most were small orders, but in Spain, 45 V√©tras were purchased by Madrid and a total of 55 by Bilbao, in multiple orders. =Outside Europe= V√©tra also found a good market in North Africa, where it sold to all but one of the eight trolleybus systems in operation, including Algiers, Constantine (3 separate operators) and Oran, in Algeria; Cairo, Egypt; Casablanca, Morocco; and Tunis, Tunisia. The sole exception was the system in T√©touan, Morocco, which bought all of its trolleybuses from Saurer. The trolleybuses sold to some of these systems in the 1930s were designed by V√©tra but built by various other companies. The company sold trolleybuses to a total of only two systems outside Europe and North Africa. Santiago, Chile, purchased 100 in 1952‚Äì53, and Niter√≥i, Brazil, opened its trolleybus system with 45 V√©tras in 1953. The Niteroi vehicles were model VBRh, which was V√©tra's most widely sold model in the post-war era, bought by many cities.Murray, pp. 12, 100 and 103. By contrast, the Santiago vehicles were a unique model, VA2, and were approximately the same size as, and bore a strong resemblance to, trolleybuses that the Santiago system had purchased from the U.S. company Pullman-Standard in 1946‚Äì48 and 1952.The Trolleybuses of Santiago: 1947‚Äì1978 (pictures). Allen Morrison. 2006. Retrieved January 24, 2012. Last active examples A small fleet of short- chassis vehicles in Lyon were the last V√©tra trolleybuses in service anywhere. By 1983, with the retirement of St. Etienne's last V√©tra trolleybuses, Limoges and Lyon were the only systems anywhere that continued to use V√©tras in service. The last active examples in Limoges were ex-Paris VBRh vehicles built in 1949‚Äì54, and these were retired in June 1989. This left the Lyon trolleybus system as the last operator of V√©tra trolleybuses anywhere. Although Lyon once had a large fleet of V√©tra trolleybuses, by late 1981 all that remained were ones from a batch of 22 VBH85 trolleybuses, built jointly by V√©tra and Berliet in 1963, which had a short chassis and were used only on Lyon route 6, which follows narrow streets and has hairpin turns. In 1984/85, Lyon operator TCL chose to refurbish seven of these, rather than buy a new batch of non- standard-length trolleybuses just for one route.Trolleybus Magazine No. 138 (Nov.-Dec. 1984), p. 136. National Trolleybus Association (UK). As a result, these last V√©tra trolleybuses (renumbered 1701‚Äì1707) received an extended life, remaining in service until early 2000.Trolleybus Magazine No. 232 (July- Aug. 2000), pp. 89‚Äì90. Preservation More than 30 V√©tra-built trolleybuses have been preserved, with 33 examples accounted for as of 2000, all but four being in France.Murray (2000), pp. 145‚Äì154 (chapter 6, worldwide list of preserved trolleybuses; mainly pp. 148‚Äì150, France). =By operators= Some are owned by transit agencies that are currently still operate trolleybuses, but the vehicles concerned may or may not be in operating condition. The Limoges trolleybus system has preserved 1944/45 CB60 No. 18, and the Lyon system has preserved 1962 V√©tra-Berliet ELR No. 10 (which is ex-Marseille 331 in 1977). The St. Etienne system has preserved three different examples: 1952 VCR No. 72, 1955 VA3B2 No. 151 (ex-Marseille 155), and 1962 VBBh/ELR No. 126. =At museums= Three restored V√©tra trolleybuses on display at the , in Paris Most of the surviving V√©tra trolleybuses are in the collections of museums or preservation groups. The largest number, by far, is owned by the (AMTUIR), in Paris, which counted 10 V√©tra trolleybuses in its collection as of 2000. The (MPTUR), in La Barque, has three V√©tra trolleybuses. The (ARTM), in Marseille, has two. At least three V√©tra trolleybuses are preserved outside France, including Limoges No. 5 (a 1943 CB60), which is owned by an individual but is kept at The Trolleybus Museum at Sandtoft, in the UK, and operates occasionally at the museum.Bramley, R.N.

A tributary of Sooswa river, which in turn is a tributary of the Ganges, it originates as spring-fed stream in the southern slopes of the Radi Top of Mussoorie ridge of the Himalayan range and runs from Dhanaulti towards Narendranagar. As is common in hilly areas, there are several streams running south from the mountains that merge into one river that emerges from the hills a little after Sahastradhara. Song is one of the largest rivers that drain the Doon Valley traversing , and its tributaries includes, Kali Gad , Bindal River and Rispana River. Sahastradhara It is a popular scenic spot for the nature lovers, based on the banks of a tributary of the Song, the Kali Gad. It was more famous for its healing sulphur springs but is now more of a picnic spot with families crowding the waters in the summer. Hydrology The Kali Gad merges into the main Song river east of the Kalinga Hill. After this confluence, the Song is a broad river valley, larger than its western counterpart - The Assan River . The river now flows through the valley in a south-eastern direction passing through the regions of Harrawala and Doiwala. It is a perennial river, however the water surges during the monsoon as can be seen from the bridge at Doiwala. The river proceeds southward till it merges with the Sooswa river. The Sooswa in turn originates from the southern Shivalik range separating the Doon valley from Saharanpur district and Haridwar district, collecting water from several small streams, including the once perennial Rispana. It flows westwards to Doiwala and can be seen through thick forest from the train running from Haridwar to Dehradun. The river then flows through the forest of Kansrao before its confluence with the Ganges at Raiwala. Irrigation The Song River has a great significance in the field of irrigation of various agricultural areas of Dehradun. A canal was constructed in the 18th century from the River at Kalinga, Maldevta to irrigate the large agricultural area of Raipur.

The Yuwaalayaay language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Shire of Balonne, including the town of Dirranbandi as well as the border town of Goodooga extending to Walgett and the Narran Lakes in New South Wales. =European= Eastern parts of the region around the upper reaches of the Warrego River were explored by Thomas Mitchell in 1845. It wasn't until after William Landsborough explored the area during his 1862 expedition that settlers began to take up pastoral runs. The Burke and Wills Dig Tree at Bullah Bullah Waterhole on Cooper Creek, 2008 In 1860, Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills began an expedition from Melbourne to the Gulf of Carpentaria to explore large areas of inland Australia which remained completely unknown to the European settlers. A pivotal meeting place or dep√¥t camp used by the expedition was located at Bullah Bullah Waterhole on Cooper Creek. After failing to reach the northern coastline due to the mangrove swamps of the Flinders River delta the party of four set off for the return journey short on supplies. Charles Gray died on the way leaving three of the party who eventually managed to return to Cooper Creek on 21 April 1861, only to find the other half of the party had just left for Menindee nine hours earlier. A tree at the camp was used to depict three blazes and mark the location of a food cache. It also became the resting place for Burke who died of malnourishment after they ran low on supplies amid controversial and tragic circumstances. Wills also died from weakness and malnourishment downstream at Breerily Waterhole. John King was the sole survivor of the party that trekked north to the gulf. The expedition's journals and maps inspired pastoralists and opened up of vast tracts of Queensland to pastoral settlement. Western parts of the region receive an average of 150 mm annual rainfall. Further east around St. George, receives an average of 500 mm per year. Limited access to water in the region restricted early pastoralism. After artesian bore water had been discovered and developed the lands were able to support sheep and not just cattle. A Cobb & Co factory and was built at Charleville in 1893. During the 1880s coach services expanded into the region. Cobb & Co was Australia's most famous historical coaching firm and once provided passenger and mail services across the country. They produced an eight-passenger coach that gained repute for its strength, stability and the forgiving suspension. In 1922, QANTAS began its first regular flights from Charleville. Geography Mulga woodland, 2006 The northern extent of the Sturt Stony Desert lies within the region around the location known as Cameron Corner. Part of the Cooper Basin is located in the region. The basin contains the most significant on-shore petroleum and natural gas deposits in Australia. Near Roma at Hospital Hill, Australia's first natural gas strike was made. Oil was found in the region in 1961. The Eromanga Basin, also located in South West Queensland has been explored and developed for petroleum production. Commercial quantities of gas were first discovered in 1976 and oil in 1978. The Tookoonooka crater is a large impact crater located in the region, however it is not visible at the surface. =Settlements= Water bore hole into the Great Artesian Basin at Thargomindah, 2007 Major towns of South West Queensland include Charleville, Roma, Augathella, Windorah, Thargomindah, St George and Cunnamulla. Cunnamulla has the biggest wool-loading station on the Queensland railway network. Australia's largest cotton farm, Cubbie Station near St George, covers 93,000 hectares. Smaller towns in the region include Amby, Injune, Jackson, Mitchell, Muckadilla, Mungallala, Surat, Wallumbilla, Yuleba, Alton, Bollon, Boolba, Dirranbandi, Hebel, Mungindi, Nindigully, Thallon, Coongoola, Eulo, Humeburn, Tuen, Wyandra, Yowah, Bakers Bend, Morven, Nive, Sommariva, Thargomindah, Hungerford, Noccundra, Nockatunga, Norley, Oontoo, Quilpie, Adavale, Cheepie, Eromanga and Toompine. Cooladdi is a ghost town with a population of just six. =Springs= Historical geographical records have suggested changes in the flow of local tertiary sandstone springs have occurred since the 1880s. Blasting was often used to enhance spring flow and consequently causing its destruction as with bores and dams. Only 45% of springs that were historically documented in the south west queensland records, remain. =Rivers= The Warrego River at Cunnamulla, 2010 Waterways coursing through South West Queensland include the Warrego, Maranoa, Merivale, Balonne and its tributary the Bokhara River, Culgoa, Wilson and Cooper Creek. The Balonne is used for an extensive irrigation network. The Bulloo River system is the only closed river system in Australia.Char Speedy, \\"The Bulloo River System: life along the Bullo River 1880-1920s\\", Watson, Ferguson and Co =Protected areas= A number of national parks have been declared in the region, including Alton National Park, Chesterton Range National Park, Culgoa Floodplain National Park, Currawinya National Park, Diamantina National Park, Idalia National Park, Lake Bindegolly National Park, Mariala National Park, Thrushton National Park and Tregole National Park. Bowra Sanctuary is a nature reserve near Cunnamulla which is managed by the Australian Wildlife Conservancy. Transport Stagecoach outside Adavale post office, 1907 Major roads in the region include the Mitchell Highway out of outback New South Wales and the Balonne Highway which travels east from St George to Cunnamulla. The Warrego Highway travels in an east‚Äìwest direction across the north of the region. The northern tip of the Castlereagh Highway passes through the south east of the region, terminating at St George. Also passing through St George is the Carnarvon Highway and the Diamantina Development Road is slowly being upgraded. The regions is serviced by seven airports, including Dirranbandi Airport, Roma Airport, St George Airport, Charleville Airport, Thargomindah Airport, Cunnamulla Airport and Quilpie Airport. The Western railway line reached Charleville in 1888. A branch line to Cunnamulla was opened in 1898. Today, The Westlander passenger train service operates between Brisbane and Charleville. The South Western railway line passes through Thallon in the south east corner of the region. Environment Bioregions in the area include the Mulga Lands. Mulga is a shrub or small tree native to arid outback Australia which has developed extensive adaptations to the dry conditions. There is an isolated population of rufous-crowned emu-wren living in spinifex shrubland which is found in the region. The Dingo Fence runs through the region and is the world's longest fence. The region is covered by red, brown and grey clays. Red sands and earths predominate, which is typical of arid Australia. Opals Polished opal from Yowah Adavale was the location of Australia's first opal discovery. The town of Yowah is built on an opal field which began producing opals in the 1870s. Opals are also found at Koroit opal field, Quilpie, Eulo and in northern New South Wales. The geological formation containing opals in South West Queensland is called the Winton Formation.

Continuing through a survey of previous ecclesiastical opinion that the place is perhaps subterranean, though considered by the theologian and his peers as an exact location unknown, he includes as part of his survey the need as an imperative of a person to contemplate the manner by which they might be redeemed from having to dwell within there at all {paragraph III}.Hypatia Bradlaugh Bonner 1913 - Christian Hell from the 1st to the 20th Century Kessinger Publishing, 2003 - 168 pages Retrieved 2012-01-25 see also: New Europe College - Academia.edu The second part is separated into six paragraphs, three of shorter length. The second part begins with a confirmation of the fate of all those persons at the present time and those in Biblical times who failed to appreciate the punishment awaiting themselves in hell, continuing to find proof in the scriptures for the existence hell available not only to Christian adherents, but also to the rational mind. {paragraphs I, II, III & IV} In paragraph V Hontheim provides reasoning that the punishment of sinners is evident from his own observation of the ways of the world and a rationale for the necessitated existence of hell versus the therefore negated possibility of death being the same as the annihilation of the self.

Part three is the longest part by a little way and begins by examining attitudes to the eternally damned, from sources in history among people and peoples within the Church {paragraph I}, looking into Biblical sources {paragraph II} and refuting other criticisms that hell is anything other than a condemnation to last for eternity. In the third paragraph the author sees the existence of hell as produced by the needs of a moral functioning of all life including that of God, that is of humanities relation to God and that the divine Creator having produced all the heavens and earth should have ordered the world as fitting for the moral person to understand death as necessary and of divine purpose. In the remainder of the part the author counters objection and critique of the doctrine set forth by the Church, and re-iterates the holding a true understanding of an everlasting retribution and hellish Hell-bound fate for sinners, going so far as to cast doubt on the likelihood even of the existence of Purgatorio for the souls. In part four Hontheim includes reference to St Thomas for the first time and examines the conditions of those that would dwell within Hell with respect to whether they possess any capacity for moral choice due to their eternal division from the divine medium that had empowered them while dwelling on earth, of this he concludes no choice is possible other than those delimited to hatred. In part five the Hontheim describes an element of suffering of those souls in Hell and analysis of this and the thoughts of those that dwell within. Parts six, seven and eight continue with the description of the nature of the suffering of the damned concluding with a rebuffal of the suggestion that the souls of Hell would adapt to their existence there-by through tolerance learn the favour of such a place to re-iterate the earlier preference for a suffering that never ceases.

They used a 1950s drum machine named \\"Barbie\\" until their third album when drummer Chris Little joined. Gage, Holt, and Kayon did lead vocals. Gage and Holt were the primary songwriters. As they explained to a writer for Spin, the band was a self- managed collective: Holt and Gage did public relations, Alexander did the finances, Bartell did record distribution and promotion, Kayon took care of graphics, and Frucci drove their truck. Touring Gage said about their first show in 1983 at the Pride Festival in Loring Park, \\"What we were doing was very unusual. The music was unusual. What was frustrating is that you reach a point where you want people to listen to the music and get past the novelty aspect and pay attention, which I think people do relatively quickly\\". The band toured for five years, playing CBGB, Folk City and the Walker Art Center. They played The Bottom Line twice in 1985, once opening for Richard Thompson. At the time, Minneapolis had a healthy indie music scene that included Prince, The Replacements and, booking acts from across the world, the nightclub First Avenue where the band played about 10 times from 1984 through 1986. Recordings and critical reaction Critics loved all three albums, and more universally applauded their first two, both self-produced on their own indie label, Rapunzel. Trouser Press thought their second album, American Dream, showed what they could do as songwriters: topics covered included the Unification Church, the American family, world peace and gay murder. They also thought the singers \\"could blow the Bangles off the map\\". The band then worked with Victor DeLorenzo and Brian Ritchie of Violent Femmes who produced their third album. In an interview with The Michigan Daily, Holt explained the addition of a drummer, \\"the feeling was our music wasn't weird enough to get art grants and yet without a drummer it wasn't accessible enough to a lot of people\\". Holt said of their song \\"Bless Me\\", an \\"irreverent\\" look at religious confession, \\"it's just in fun for us, and that's kind of the way we are ... we like to poke fun at American institutions\\". A review for iTunes said it, \\"mixed folk and choral influences with the kind of lighter new wave sound of Blondie and the B-52's\\" and that: In 2007, Jon Bream, music critic for the Minneapolis Star Tribune, called them the \\"late, almost-great 1980s arty popsters\\". Writing during the same year in his book, Music Legends, Martin Keller calls the band \\"highly influential\\" and says they paved the way for Babes in Toyland and ZuZu's Petals. Billboard said in 1985: John Bush, writing for Allmusic, said their third album, Clay Foot Gods, \\"proved a disappointment, much more commercial than the first two LPs.\\" Spin said in 1987, however, reviewing the same album:  Discography  * T√™tes Noires (Rapunzel) 1983 * American Dream (Rapunzel) 1984 * Clay Foot Gods (Rounder) 1987 * The New American Dream (East Saint Paul Records) 2013 Notes External links * * Category:Musical groups from the Twin Cities Category:All-female bands Category:Musical groups established in 1983 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1987 Category:Punk rock groups from Minnesota Category:Rounder Records artists ","title":"T√™tes Noires"},{"id":"34492113","text":"Laboratory rats are used in some animal models of schizophrenia. Research into the mental disorder of schizophrenia, involves multiple animal models as a tool, including in the preclinical stage of drug development. Several models simulate schizophrenia defects. These fit into four basic categories: pharmacological models, developmental models, lesion models, and genetic models. Historically, pharmacological, or drug-induced models were the most widely used. These involve the manipulation of various neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine, glutamate, serotonin, and GABA. Lesion models, in which an area of an animal's brain is damaged, arose from theories that schizophrenia involves neurodegeneration, and that problems during neurodevelopment cause the disease. Rodent models of schizophrenia mostly display symptoms analogous to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, with some models also having symptoms similar to the negative symptoms. Animals used as models for schizophrenia include rats, mice, and primates. Uses and limitations The modelling of schizophrenia in animals can range from attempts to imitate the full extent of symptoms found in schizophrenia, to more specific modelling which investigate the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs. Each extreme has its limitations, with whole-syndrome modelling often failing due to the complexity and heterogeneous nature of schizophrenia, and antipsychotic-specific modelling being often not useful for discovering drugs with unique mechanisms of action. Developing models based on a particular sign or symptom of schizophrenia has been one approach. This approach has the advantage that the results are more likely to be valid across the species boundary. In order for an animal model to be useful in developing treatments, results from the animal model must translate into results in the patient with schizophrenia, this is called the validity of the model. Criteria for assessing the validity of animal models of schizophrenia include face validity, construct validity, and predictive validity. While no animal model can fully encompass all aspects of schizophrenia, progress has been made in using animals to model schizophrenia and its relationship to other mental disorders, such as addiction. Phenotype The validity of an animal model of schizophrenia can be measured using several behavioural, cellular and anatomical traits (the phenotype of the model). =Behavioural traits= ;Prepulse inhibition :Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is the inhibition of the response to a startling stimulus when the stimulus is preceded by a weaker stimulus. Abnormalities in PPI are seen in patients with schizophrenia. ;Latent inhibition : Anomalies in latent inhibition have been linked with schizophrenia in acute events. in latent inhibition, frequent presentation of a stimulus reduces the rate at which the stimulus produces meaning. ;Paired click gating :In Paired-click gating or P50 gating, a click which quickly follows a previous click produces a reduced response. This gating is reduced in schizophrenia patients relative to normal subjects. ;Social withdrawal :One of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia is social withdrawal, this has been modelled by socially isolating animals. ;Locomotor traits :Some locomotor changes, including stereotypy, are used to test the validity of animal models. Locomotor anomalies are often found in patients with schizophrenia. =Other traits= ;Cortical volume :Reduced volume of the prefrontal cortex is an anatomical trait of schizophrenia patients which is used to test the validity of animal models. ;NMDA receptor gene expression :Variations in the expression of the NR2B and NR1 subunits of the NMDA receptor are used to test developmental animal models. ;Dopamine release :Neuroimaging studies on patients with schizophrenia have found increased dopamine release after treatment with amphetamine relative to normal controls. Pharmacological models =Dopamine= Dopamine pathways and associated brain regions. (VTA is the ventral tegmental area.)In the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia, schizophrenia was hypothesised to be caused by disturbed dopamine neurotransmission. Dopamine is a monoamine neurotransmitter which is involved in other diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. There is evidence for increased activity of the mesolimbic pathway, a dopaminergic pathway, in schizophrenia patients. This comes from the discovery of increased L-DOPA decarboxylase levels in the brains of these patients. L-DOPA decarboxylase is an enzyme which converts L-DOPA to dopamine by removing a carboxyl group. Animal models were first produced for schizophrenia by altering the dopaminergic system using drugs. Persistent treatment of rodents with amphetamine models show symptoms of schizophrenia including hyperactivity, enduring prepulse inhibition abnormalities, and cognitive abnormalities associated with the prefrontal cortex including attention deficits. Neither negative symptoms, such as problems with social interaction, or hippocampus- related deficits are observed in amphetamine rodent models. The antipsychotics clozapine and haloperidol reverse the effects of amphetamine on attention in rats. =Glutamate= Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in vertebrate nervous systems. Evidence for the involvement of glutamate in schizophrenia includes analogous symptoms which are produced by glutamate NMDA receptor antagonists such as phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine. PCP is a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist which produces hallucinations and delusions in normal subjects. In rat models, disturbed cognition, deficits in social interaction, locomotor anomalies, and prepulse inhibition deficits are seen on acute administration of PCP. Evidence that persistent PCP use and abuse in humans results in lasting deficits beyond the period of treatment has led to the suggestion that this regime in rodents may be a more accurate model of schizophrenia than acute administration. A number of protocols for chronic PCP animal models have been developed, with different effects. The effects of some, but not all protocols can be reversed by treatment with antipsychotics. In a primate model, PCP was found to induce cognitive impairments which were reversed with clozapine. =Serotonin= Serotonin is a monoamine neurotransmitter which has been associated with schizophrenia. The psychedelic drug classes indoleamines and phenethylamines can affect serotoninergic 5-HT2A receptors. LSD, an indoleamine, affects startle habituation and prepulse inhibition of startle, which are indicators of human schizophrenia. =GABA= Œ≥-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter. The GABAergic system may be involved in schizophrenia due to its interactions with the dopaminergic system. Picrotoxin, an antagonist for the GABAA receptor, produces prepulse inhibition of startle in rats. Haloperidol, an antipsychotic drug, reduces this effect. Lesions Studies into the neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative aspects of schizophrenia have led to the use of lesion models to investigate these aspects. A lesion is damage to an area of tissue by any cause. The evidence for the neurodegenerative theory is a reduction in the volume of the cerebral cortex and an increase in the volumes of the ventricles (cavities in the brain containing cerebrospinal fluid) associated with schizophrenia. Most neurodegenerative diseases produce increased levels of glial cells such as astrocytes, this is not found in schizophrenia. The evidence in favour of the neurodevelopmental theory includes the connection of some physical abnormalities with schizophrenia. Brain regions used in lesion models of schizophrenia include the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampal formation, and the thalamus. In rat models, lesions of the prefrontal cortex have produced increased and protracted response to stress and a lower prepulse inhibition of startle when treated with apomorphine. =Neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion= Neonatal lesions of the ventral part of the hippocampus in rats (NVHL rats) is a widely studied developmental animal model of schizophrenia. NVHL rats mimic many of the symptoms of schizophrenia in detail. The behavioural deficits caused by NVHL are seen after puberty and include aggression and social interaction abnormalities. The precise effects of the lesion depend on the day on which it is administered. Developmental models There is evidence from epidemiological studies that environmental factors during gestation or around childbirth can increase the probability of someone developing schizophrenia. =Methylazoxymethanol acetate= Molecular model of methylazoxymethanol acetate. Methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) is used during gestation to affect aspects of neural development. MAM selectively targets neuroblasts in the central nervous system. As neuroblasts are cells which become neurons, interfering with them using MAM inhibits the areas of the brain which are developing most quickly. The effects of MAM therefore depend on the stage of development at which it is administered, or the gestational age of the subject. In rat studies, administration of MAM at day 17 of gestation (GD17) results in several cognitive and anatomical changes which are common to schizophrenia patients. The thickness of the hippocampus and the thalamus are reduced, the locomotor effects of amphetamines and the spontaneous firing rate of dopominergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area are increased, and defects in working spatial memory are observed. =Social isolation= Rats have a specific social organization within colonies. In social isolation models, pups which are placed in separate cages after being weaned show behavioural changes as adults and altered neural development. These changes remain after being re-introduced into the colony in adulthood. The behavioural deficits caused include neophobia, a larger response to new stimulus, locomotor hyperactivity, and increased aggression. Social isolation rats' inability to habituate to new environments may be caused by an increased mesolimbic dopaminergic activity. Genetic models Studies involving twins have shown that schizophrenia is a heritable disease. While no one gene is responsible for the disease, a large number of possible genes have been identified. Genetic animal models of schizophrenia often involve knockout mice, genetically modified mice where one or more of these genes is removed or disrupted. =DISC1= Disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) was one of the first genes discovered to be involved in schizophrenia. As of 2011, seven different strains of DISC1 mouse models had been developed. As in schizophrenia patients, DISC1 mice have an increased lateral ventricle size, reduced cortical size, changes to the hippocampus, and changes to prepulse inhibition of startle which are reversed on treatment with haloperidol and clozapine. One DISC1 mouse model is induced by the mutagenic chemical ENU. ENU introduces missense point mutations; screening for mutations in a particular exon of DISC1 can produce mouse models with schizophrenia-like behavioural deficits. =Neuregulin 1 and associated genes= The gene NRG1 codes for neuregulin 1, a growth factor which is crucial to the development of the nervous system, and to neurotransmission and formation of synapses in adults. NRG1 and the gene for the receptor to which neuregulin 1 binds, ERBB4, have been tested as possible animal models of schizophrenia. While mice which have two copies of (are homozygous for) a knocked out version of NRG1 do not survive, viable animal models have been developed using heterozygous or partial knockout. One such mouse model is the heterozygous removal of the EGF- like domain on neuregulin 1, these models are called Nrg1(ŒîEGF)+/‚àí mice. Nrg1(ŒîEGF)+/‚àí mice have been shown to have social interaction problems, reduced prepulse of inhibition and larger spontaneous locomotion. Other neuregulin 1 models include the heterozygous removal of the transmembrane domain (Nrg1(ŒîTM)+/‚àí mice) and the immunoglobulin domain (Nrg1(ŒîIg)+/‚àí mice). Nrg1(ŒîTM)+/‚àí mice display hyperactivity in various conditions, an effect which is reduced by the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. =Dysbindin= Dysbindin is a protein coded for by the gene DTNBP1, which has been linked to schizophrenia. Dysbindin may be involved in the changes to neurotransmission observed in patients with schizophrenia. According to SA Jones et al, DTNBP1 is \\"currently thought to be one of the most promising candidate genes for schizophrenia susceptibility\\". One naturally occurring animal model involving dysbindin, the sdy (sandy) mouse, has a number of anatomical changes compared to normal mice, including changes to the hippocampus. Sdy mice have homozygous mutations to DTNBP1, and lack the ability to produce dysbindin, heterozygous mutants can be produced by crossing sdy mice with a strain of normal mice. =Reelin= alt=Video illustrating the gait abnormalities in reeler mice.Reelin is a protein which is involved in synaptic plasticity and synaptogenesis in the brain. In the frontal cortices, cerebellums, and hippocampi of schizophrenia patients, the amount of the protein and its messenger RNA are reduced. Knockout mice in which the reelin gene is disrupted are called reeler mice. In homozygous reeler mice, extreme changes in gait and other behavioural anomalies are seen (illustrated in video); these changes go beyond those associated with schizophrenia. Heterozygous reeler mice display lower social dominance in some tests, but other social deficits seen in schizophrenia are absent. Reeler mice also have schizophrenia-like anatomical defects in the frontal cortex, but have few cognitive defects which are associated with that area and found in schizophrenia. Tests using the Morris water maze have found that reeler mice do not have the abnormalities in spatial reference memory which are found in patients with schizophrenia. =Other genetic models= ;G72/G30 :The G72/G30 gene complex is a possible risk factor for schizophrenia; male animal mutants have less aggressive behaviours and have olfactory abnormalities. ;PPP3CC :PPP3CC is a gene in which mutations are risk factors for schizophrenia; knockout animal models have social deficits.

She has also worked on a range of factual programming, both as an independent producer, and at the BBC, and was RT√â's first female Director of Television. She later became Director of Digital Television for the BBC, the Corporation's first Channels Executive for BBCi and a deputy Controller of BBC One. Career O'Rahilly was appointed Editor of BBC One's Watchdog and its accompanying programme Weekend Watchdog in November 1997 and held the position until May 1999. She took over at Watchdog as ten of the UK's largest companies established a pressure group to discuss how to deal with complaints about the series. From 1999 to 2000 she was Director of Television Production at RT√â, becoming the first woman to hold that position, but she later moved back to the BBC to take up the role of Creative Director for Digital Channels in the BBC‚Äôs General Factual department. There she was responsible for bringing several series to television, including Rock Shrines and Clive Anderson‚Äôs Conspiracies. In November 2001 she was appointed as the first Channels Executive for BBCi, a job which required her to liaise with the directors of the various BBC channels in order to facilitate links between Television commissioning and the BBC‚Äôs Interactive Television team.

In 2010 she returned to Dublin to address the first \\"Women on Air\\" conference at the city's National Library, offering an insight into the television industry from a female perspective. Criticisms of RT√â Since leaving RT√â, O'Rahilly has several times been critical of it. In May 2011, she launched a scathing attack on RT√â's flagship programme, The Late Late Show amid criticism that standards on the programme had slipped since Ryan Tubridy took over as presenter in 2009. In an online blog, O'Rahilly wrote, \\"If I was back in charge of RT√â, you wouldn‚Äôt see this utter shite on Friday night\\". In January 2015, following Health Minister Leo Varadkar's public coming out on RT√â Radio, O'Rahilly referred to her own, very different, experiences at RT√â, commenting on Twitter: \\"The list of RTE homophobes would give you chills ‚Ä¶ all happy to be such in 2000 not now in 2015.

His best known works are those about \\"Cappy, The Pitman's Dog\\" and \\"The Pitman's Courtship\\".  Early life  William Mitford, was born at Preston (which was a village close to North Shields) on 10 April 1788. His parents died when he was very young, and at the age of 3 or 4 his uncle brought him to Newcastle upon Tyne. He became a shoemaker's apprentice, possibly to the father of Willie Armstrong, and worked in Dean Street. The earliest record of William Mitford appears in the budget chapbook \\"Newcastle Songster\\" series in 1816. Mitford went on to write some of the region's most well-known songs. It is known that Mitford played the part of the bishop in the \\"Coronation\\" by The Cordwainers Company of Newcastle upon Tyne at The Freeman Hospital in Westgate, on the Festival of St. Crispin (the patron saints of cobblers, tanners, and leather workers) on 29 June 1823.  Later life  Shortly after, he left the shoemaking trade and moved on to the licensed trade. He opened a public house, \\"The North Pole\\", on the edge of Castle Leazes, near to the Spital Tongues area of the city, and while there he wrote the song, named after the pub, and called \\"The North Pole\\". He would perform often in his own public house. He moved on from here to the \\"Tailor's Arms\\", which was more central at the head of \\"The Side\\". Mention of his being there was made in 1834 by William Watson. Eventually Mitford retired, and lived in Oyster Shell Lane (close to Bath lane). He died there on 3 March 1851 at the age of 63. He was buried in Westgate Hill General Cemetery, Arthur's Hill, Newcastle upon Tyne.  Works  The main character he seemed to write about was Bob Cranky, a habitual braggart, and written in his 20s. This material includes :- * The Pitman's Courtship ‚Äì generally considered to be one of the region's finest 'traditional' songs. One of only a handful of Tyneside songs to be appreciated outside the region in its day * Cappy (The Pitman's Dog) * XYZ * The North Pole * The New Fish Market ‚Äì A Protest song before protest songs were invented ‚Äì When Richard Grainger the Architect set out his ideas for redevelopment the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne which would involve the demolition and re- building and re-siting of many old buildings including the Old Fish Market. William Mitford put down his concerns in song: ‚ÄúWhere's the wee shop that once held Jack the Barber? Gone to make way for the fish brought to harbour\\"! A note on chapbooks In the early 19th century, as today, there were cheap books and magazines. Many of these ‚Äúchapbooks‚Äù were on poor quality paper to a poor standard and with poor quality print. The works were copied with no thoughts of copyright, and the work required very little proof-reading, and what was done was not required to a high standard. Consequently, the dialect words of songs varied between editions. The books were produced in bulk, at very little cost, and provided a good income for the producers. They reflected popular taste, and were sold, usually for a penny (or less). Newcastle was during this period the second largest producer of chapbooks in the country. One such chapbook was the Newcastle Songster, Which containing in total 11 songs, and was published by J Marshall of the Old Flesh Market, with a cover which read :- The Newcastle Songster, being a choice collection of songs, descriptive of the language and manners of the common people of Newcastle upon Tyne and the neighbourhood. No pompous ftrains, nor labour‚Äôd lines are here, But genuine wit and sportive mirth appear: Northumbria‚Äôs genius in her simple rhymes, Shall live an emblem to succeeding times. Printed by J Marfhall, in the FlefhMarket where may also be had, a large and curious Affortment of Songs, Ballads, Tales, Hiftories, &c.; Another, dating from c 1846 was ‚ÄúSongs of the Tyne\\", a series printed by, John Ross of the Royal Arcade, Newcastle upon Tyne. Number 1 of the series refers to the building of the High Level Bridge, and therefore cannot be before 1846. A number of the songs, including \\"The pitman's courtship\\" date from the early 19th century Recordings A recording of \\"The Pitman's Courtship\\" appeared on the CD Graeme Danby sings stories from the North East. \\"The Pitman's Courtship\\" was included in the CD Come you not from Newcastle? ‚Äì Newcastle songs volume 1 ‚Äì which is one of 20 CDs in the boxed set Northumbria Anthology \\"The new fish market\\" also written by William Mitford ‚Äì from the album Take Yourself a Wife sung by Megson (but not in dialect).

Producing films in the way is what leads to a singular perspective and opinion (in this case white peoples) to dominate mainstream media. Richard Dyer's White: Essays on Race and Culture, he states that ‚Äúresearch repeatedly shows that in western representation white overwhelmingly and disproportionately predominant, have the central and elaborated roles, and above all are placed as the norm, the ordinary, the standard.‚ÄùDyer, Richard. White: Essays on Race and Culture. London and New York: Routledge, 1997. This representation has become a norm in regards to Hollywood film, which in turn has created problematic issues creating narrative ideas of representation of race in ideologies, stereotypes, racism, oppression, representation and ideas of the Other. Dyer also states that ‚Äúrace is not only attributable to people who are not white, nor is the imagery of non-white people the only racial imagery.‚ÄùDyer, Richard. White: Essays on Race and Culture. London and New York: Routledge, 1997. Elements of film such as narrative structure, camera angles and dialogue can portray racism as a core theme, especially within the proclamation of power and authority enlisted by white people. Its place within Hollywood cinema orchestrates its lack of awareness especially when the Hollywood film industry is continuously dominated by figures of immense control that are usually white as suggested above. ‚ÄúNational self-consciousness, generally seen as a precondition for nationhood ‚Äì that is, the shared belief of desperate individuals that they share common origins, status, location, and aspirations ‚Äì became broadly linked to cinematic fictions.‚ÄùShohat, Ella and Robert Stam. Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media London: Routledge, 1994. With full consciousness nonetheless of a lack of representation recognised, it highlights the battle among unsurprising ideals that don‚Äôt equate to any ethnic exactitudes. ‚ÄúThe sensitivity around stereotypes and distortions largely arises then, from the powerlessness of historically marginalised groups to control their own representation.‚ÄùShohat, Ella and Robert Stam. Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media London: Routledge, 1994. The absence of controlling the depiction of cultures, particularly people of colour, therefore, warrants need for more ethnic voices within Hollywood to speak on behalf of their culture. ‚ÄúFurthermore, in that the Hollywood system favours big-budget blockbusters, it is not only classist but also Eurocentric, in effect if not in explicit intention; to be a player in this game one needs to have economic power.‚ÄùShohat, Ella and Robert Stam. Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media London: Routledge, 1994. The perspectives or perhaps lack of throughout Hollywood and black representation links back to dated times of colonialism and post-colonial perspectives within cinema. Europeans created a gathering of colonialism and its culture which imposed an awareness of privilege and ascendency to ‚Äúlesser breeds without the law‚Äù,Shohat, Ella and Robert Stam. Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media London: Routledge, 1994. so much so creating stigmatism of us versus them through European reasoning. Shohat and Stam explore ideas of racism in Unthinking Eurocentrism and state that racism doesn‚Äôt trek effortlessly and indifferent throughout the course of time as history references racism as ‚Äúpositional, relational and means that diverse groups have occupied the functional slot of the oppressed.‚ÄùShohat, Ella and Robert Stam. Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media London: Routledge, 1994. This continues to be the reality in Hollywood as ‚Äúracism is above all a social relation ‚Äì systematized hierarchization implacably pursued‚Ä¶ anchored in material structures and embedded in historical configurations of power.‚ÄùShohat, Ella and Robert Stam. Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media London: Routledge, 1994. Historically, as mentioned by Shohat and Stam, they link the correlation between racism and that it is the consequence of colonialism. However, although it‚Äôs not definitively connected, due to the colonial past it is a durable attribute to racism. Even in today‚Äôs movies the roles for an African-American performer often fall under similar typecast roles, the biggest movie with African-American leads in 2011 was The Help. In the 2012 Academy Awards The Help was nominated for several categories: Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role Octavia Spencer also nominated for the same category was Jessica Chastain, Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role Viola Davis, and Best Motion Picture of the Year. The movie walked away with one win for Best Supporting Actress Octavia Spencer, leaving Viola Davis to lose to Meryl Streep, a 20-time nominee and three-time winner. Octavia Spencer was the only African American to win an award that night. The New York Times wrote: \\"Race in American cinema has rarely been a matter of simple step-by-step progress. It has more often proceeded in fits and starts, with backlashes coming on the heels of breakthroughs, and periods of intense argument followed by uncomfortable silence.\\" Old Hollywood Due to the racial discrimination in the 19th and early 20th centuries, Hollywood tended to avoid using African- American actors/actress. In the 19th century, Blackface became a popular form of entertainment. Blackface let Hollywood use different characters without actually having to employ anyone with a darker skin tone. Actor Al Jolson made blackface popular with characters such as Amos 'n' Andy and Jakie Rabinowitz. In 1930, the craze of blackface died out because of its connotations with bigotry and racism. In 1951 when Amos 'n' Andy was brought to television, Clarence Muse \\"championed the popular comedy. Despite its demeaning caricatures, he argued, the program at least moved African-American performers to center stage.'\\" He then \\"self-published a pamphlet entitled 'The Dilemma of the Negro Actor.' In it, he made the incisive observation that African- American performers were caught in a trap. 'There are two audiences in America to confront,' he wrote, 'the white audience with a definite desire for buffoonery and song, and the Negro audience with a desire to see the real elements of Negro life portrayed.'\\" \\"Despite its demeaning caricatures, he argued, the program at least moved African-American performers to center stage.'\\" The roles given to African American actors followed old stereotypes. There was the Tom who was someone who served white people, the Coon who acted goofy (like a clown or naive), then there was the \\"Tragic Mulatto\\" who was someone who tried to \\"pass for being white\\", the Mammy who was seen as asexual, helped to raise the young, and helped families, and the Buck who was often a male who was hypersexualized and seen as a threat. Shohat, Ella and Robert Stam. Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media, 2nd ed. London and New York: Routledge, 2014. Though the roles were demeaning for the communities with darker skin tones, some actors and actresses were so desperate to represent their communities or to change the ways of Hollywood they knew that any part is a part. Performers such as Sidney Poitier and Hattie McDaniel would do whatever they would have to in order to pave the way for other African-American actors and actresses. New Hollywood African- American actresses and actors are more common on the big screen, but they are still scarce in bigger blockbuster movies, \\"with the stakes high, many studio executives worry that films that focus on African-American themes risk being too narrow in their appeal to justify the investment. Hollywood has nonetheless shown an interest in recent years to bank more heavily on African- American actors and themes.\\" Studio executives explain the lack of presence of the African Americans in supporting or starring roles by stating ‚Äúonly 4 out of 10 movies turn a profit, according to the Association of Motion Picture and Television Producers. But because pictures with nearly all-black casts come along more infrequently, they tend to stand out more when they fail\\". The then and now 2014 Academy Awards were a turning point for African-American films, with the film 12 Years a Slave taking home the Oscar for Best Picture. In 2013, five African-American films were released (12 Years a Slave, Fruitvale Station, Lee Daniels' The Butler, Best Man Holiday and Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom). The release of such films had a broader impact on the film industry with movie attendance by African Americans growing by 13% compared to 2012. Some truly believe that Hollywood has changed with directors such as Spike Lee and Tyler Perry who cast all African-American films, and who have become such household names paving the way further for the rest of the African-American community. Though both directors have significantly different ways of portraying the African American community, the popularity of both directors seems to signify to some that the racial tension in Hollywood has ended. Adding to the movement, Disney introduced the first African-American princess, Tiana, in 2009. People felt that \\"the color barrier is breaking down in Hollywood\\". A majority of people may still see the thin line between Hollywood's \\"new\\" attitude toward race and their \\"old\\" attitude toward race. ‚ÄúThe consolidation of a black presence in the movies and television did not signal the arrival of a postracial Hollywood any more than the election of Barack Obama in 2008 spelled the end of America‚Äôs 400-year-old racial drama.‚Äù Some speculate that the lack of ethnic wins at Hollywood's most prestigious awards is because most of the voters are older white men. It seems as though unless the African American actors and actresses are willing to bend to Hollywood pressures they will not be acknowledged by the Academy. \\"Sidney Poitier originally turned down the role of Porgy in the 1959 film (calling it 'not material complimentary to black people')\\", but eventually succumbed to Hollywood pressure. Years later, Poitier received an honorary 2010 Academy Award for helping to \\"dismantle the color line in film.\\" In 1988 during Eddie Murphy's (who was nominated in 2007) presentation of the Best Picture category, Murphy gave an impromptu speech on how he felt that the Academy Awards were racist, stating only three black people had won the award. There are many speculations on why Eddie Murphy lost the award in 2007 to Alan Arkin, one being that Murphy made the blockbuster bust Norbit. Others speculate that it is due to Murphy's comments from 1988. \\"The troubling thing is that the only two black actors in this year‚Äôs Oscar competition are cast as domestics, and would probably not have found meaty, starring roles in other films had they passed on ‚ÄúThe Help.‚Äù This brings to mind the first black Oscar winner, Hattie McDaniel, who received the award in 1940 for her portrayal of the loyal maid in ‚ÄúGone With the Wind.‚Äù \\"When criticized for often playing a mammy on film, Ms. McDaniel famously said she would rather play a maid in the movies than be one.\\" In a 2016 article titled \\"How racially skewed are the Oscars?\\", The Economist had a look at the issue as of the 21. century and found that as far as actors are concerned, \\"...the number of black actors winning Oscars in this century has been pretty much in line with the size of America's overall black population. But this does not mean Hollywood has no problems of prejudice. As the data show, it clearly does.\\" The article points to low African American membership numbers in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and under-representation at lower levels: \\"the whitewashing occurs not behind the closed doors of the Academy, but in drama schools (shown in the SAG membership) and casting offices\\". The article also highlights on a related problem: that while black actors may have gained more acknowledgment in the Oscars as of the 2000s, other minorities are still under-represented.

Retrieved 2012-01-26.Natalie Kenway, Tax-transparent funds set for 2012 rollout, Investment Week, 10 June 2011. Retrieved 2012-01-26. TTF‚Äôs will then have the option to be based in the UK rather than in competing European domiciles. Both Luxembourg and Ireland have already introduced such structures, formally known as the Fond commun de placement (FCP) and the Common contractual fund (CCF).  History  *In 2010 a lobby formed for a U.K. transparent fund to be developed ahead of the implementation of the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directives (UCITS) IV directive in July 2011. It was felt that a transparent fund would be a beneficial vehicle to complement the existing range of UK funds. Feeder fund investors under a master/feeder structure would benefit from tax treaty agreements, whilst fund managers could access greater economies of scale when all the assets are pooled in a tax efficient manner. *In the UK Government‚Äôs budget of March 2011, an announcement heralded a positive step forward in bringing a TTF to the industry by the summer of 2012. *In May 2011 an indication was given that regulation rather than legislation was required, and it would allow for more time to consult on the issues. *From May ‚Äì December 2011http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/tiin/tiin662.pdf there was an informal consultation process with industry, advisers, HM Treasury, HMRC and Financial Services Authority convening working groups, with experts from a commercial, product, legal and tax perspective. *In December 2011 an initial draft of the Finance Bill 2012 confirmed that regulators will be granted powers to exempt qualifying funds from stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax. Subsequently the Corporation Tax Act 2010 requires amendment to ensure that the new TTF funds are not accountable to pay for corporation tax. Overall this requires an amendment to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to ensure all boundaries are set and any legalities are pre-determined before TTF‚Äôs are launched. *In January 2012 a consultation document was published. The government aims to have the new/amended legislation and the TTF vehicle to come into effect by the summer of 2011.  The Benefits  *If the UK does not offer a tax transparent fund to investors and fund managers it could potentially mean billons of assets going offshore. The Investment Manager Association reviewed how this would affect the UK and included it in their budget representation http://www.investmentuk.org/assets/files/consultations/2011/20110217-bugetreps.pdf to the treasury. Due to Ireland and Luxemburg already being in this space there was a concern the UK would be left behind, especially as a number of other countrieshttp://www.fsc.org.au/downloads/file/SubmissionsFile/2011_0301_FSCsubmissiontoTreasuryreBoTCIVReview.pdf are looking at introducing this type of vehicle. *Research conducted by Northern Trusthttp://www.northerntrust.com/pws/jsp/display2.jsp?TYPE=interior&XML;=pages/nt/0802/pressRelease.xml&prd;=primary/pressrelease/1327058997255_248.xml&nxml;=/content/pages/nt/0409/63913851_3892.xml has illustrated the potential savings obtained by avoiding the drag on WHT, comparing a traditional Collective Investment Vehicle such as an Irish Investment Company with Variable Capital (ICVC) vs a CCF. Investors, who are in a traditional Irish ICVC and invest in the US equity markets that should be exempt from paying tax, suffer a 30% WHT on U.S. dividend income. The following graph illustrates the cumulative difference of a CCF less an ICVC, thus highlighting the positive impact a TTF would bring to the UK verses opaque fund structures. Source: The Northern Trust Company - January 20th 2012 *A UCITS IV Master feeder needs to be tax-transparent. The UK TTF will permit feeder funds in different domiciles to invest in the same master vehicle allowing the feeder fund to maintain the correct WHT position. Therefore funds from across Europe can be moved into a centrally managed pooling model to benefit from a consistent management strategy and operating cost efficiencies whilst still benefitting from tax advantages. *Life companies will be able to mitigate the effects of the Solvency II Directive (capital requirements) by having unit holders rather than policyholders. * Multinational Pension Pooling, governance, oversight, risk control and cost efficiencies - Grouping pension funds and other assets into a cross-border pooling fund allows for significant cost efficiencies in various areas such as investment management, administration, custody, audit and service fees. Tax neutrality is the aim here.

He was the son of Count Reinhard II of Hanau and his wife, Catherine of Nassau-Beilstein.  Reign  In 1434, when his father was still alive, he took over the guardianship of the children of his widowed sister from her first marriage with Count Thomas II of Rieneck, when she remarried with Count William II of Henneberg-Schleusingen. When his father died in 1451, he took up government of the County of Hanau. However, he died only ten months later. During his short reign, nothing remarkable happened.Ernst J. Zimmermann, Hanau Stadt und Land, 3rd ed., Hanau, 1919, reprinted 1978, p. 98  Death  Reinhard III died on 20 April 1452 in Heidelberg. He had travelled to Heidelberg to be treated by a specialist at Heidelberg University. He was buried in the St. Mary's Church in Hanau. For the next 200 years, all but one of the Counts of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg were minors when they inherited the county and died before their 30th birthday, leaving the county to an underage son. The only exception was Reinhard IV. This pattern started with Reinhard III and repeated over nine generations.

Since this image was painted 40 years after Reinhard's death, it is reasonable to assume that it is not very accurate.  Marriage and issue  He married on 11 July 1446 with Countess Palatine Margaret of Mosbach (2 March 1432 - 14 September 1457). They had two children: # Philip I the Younger (1449‚Äì1500); # Margaret (1452 ‚Äì March 14, 1467), betrothed to Philip of Eppstein, died before the marriage.

FDI is divided into four wings, namely, Production, Distribution, International Documentary and Short Film Festival. The Division produces documentaries/news magazines from its headquarters at Mumbai, films on defence and family welfare from New Delhi and featurettes focussing on rural India from the regional centres at Calcutta now (Kolkata) and Bangalore. In 1990, it was started at the annual Mumbai International Film Festival, for documentary, short and animation films at Mumbai. It houses a museum of cinema, the National Museum of Indian Cinema (NMIC), inaugurated on 19 January 2019. History Established in 1948, FDI followed the model of state controlled and monopolized production, distribution and exhibition of documentary films, news reels and propaganda films, soon transforming into the biggest producer documentary and short film production in the country. For decades to come, FDI would produce thousands of documentaries and newsreels that would reach as many as 25 million Indians a week.

It uses 3D models for backgrounds and hand-drawn 2D sprites for characters and enemies. The story is centered on a princess, Toki, and her alter ego, Towa. The theme of \\"time\\" plays an important role, and is also utilized in the game's action-oriented battle system. Plot Gameplay Battle is based on use of different skills, which the player character learns as she progresses through the game. Enemies use skills to fight as well. Throughout the game, the player switches between controlling Toki and her alter ego Towa. The switch happens on each level-up or upon using certain items. Toki and Towa have different skills: Toki is skilled at long-ranged attacks, while Towa is better at close-range fighting. The battles take place in real-time. Development and release In January 2012, the game was announced in Famitsu magazine. At that time, it had been in the planning stage for two years, and was 45 percent complete. Toki to Eien ~Toki Towa~ differs somewhat from many Japanese role-playing game by having a female protagonist, and by only having one playable character instead of a party. Producer Kei Hirono said that \\"We wanted to break the mold and step away from the current trend of male hero... to have a female hero playable character who is strong.\\" As for only having one player character, Kei said that this is both to highlight the uniqueness of the character switching mechanic, as well as to reduce animation work. Another key difference from usual JRPG fare is that Toki to Eien ~Toki Towa~ eschews the epic \\"save the world\\" type storyline for the more personally relatable experience of marriage. Kei himself was getting married at the same time that the game was in development. In May 2012, Imageepoch's CEO, Ryoei Mikage, held a meeting to determine whether Toki to Towa would be released in English. A standard edition and a limited edition were released in Japan on October 11, 2012. The limited edition includes a 48-page artwork booklet, a soundtrack and drama CD, eleven custom PlayStation 3 themes, and a special storage box. Speaking at the 2012 Taiwan Comic convention, Namco Bandai's Kei Hirono confirmed plans to released the game in English. In late December, a trademark application confirmed the English version's title to be Time and Eternity. On February 21, 2013, NIS America revealed that they would release Time and Eternity in North America on July 16 and Europe on June 28 in regular and limited edition. While some English versions of JRPGs alter the content, such as changing character names or plot details, Kei Hirono has said that \\"Aside from the language, it‚Äôs going to be the same as the Japanese version.\\" The English version will also give players the option of either Japanese or English voices. =Soundtrack= The game's theme song, \\"Rewind\\", is performed by Japanese R&B; and J-pop singer May J. The music score is by Yuzo Koshiro and Takeshi Yanagawa. Reception Time and Eternity was met with negative reception by critics and maintains a 42/100 average rating on Metacritic, pooling reviews from 39 separate online sources. Elliot Gay, associate editor of Japanator, gave the game a very negative review, heavily criticizing the characters, animation, plot, and gameplay. IGN gave it a 5.6, praising its unique combat system and character progression, but criticizing its dating simulator elements, technical issues, and repetition. Not all reviews of the game were negative; Famitsu gave the game a 32 out of 40 rating. Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku highly praised it, saying, \\"if you like JRPGs, this one is a must-play\\", though he did note the animation's \\"lack of polish\\".

It was composed of volunteers of Kitchener's Army and served in the Gallipoli and Mesopotamian campaigns. History 38th Brigade was organised as part of 13th (Western) Division, which came into existence as a result of Army Order No 324 of 21 August 1914 authorising the formation of six new volunteer infantry divisions (the 'First Kitchener Army' or 'K1'). The division was organised by Western Command and the brigades began to assemble on Salisbury Plain.

Published by Taylor and Francis. History A mineral train at East Pool Mine The proposal for Camborne and Redruth, put forward by the Urban Electric Supply Company, was for a combined lighting scheme and tramway. The Urban Electric Supply Company was a subsidiary of Edmundson's Electricity Corporation. The construction of the generating station and distribution system cost ¬£38,500 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) and the tramway and vehicles cost ¬£35,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). The tramway was constructed by Dick, Kerr & Co. in around 6 months. Track-laying started on 7 April 1902, and the network was single-tracked with eight passing loops and double tracks at each end. The sharpest curve was 40 ft radius and the steepest section on East Hill was 1:15. It was mostly complete by September 1902. Members of Camborne and Redruth Councils visited on 1 October 1902. The first trial run of the system took place on Wednesday 8 October 1902, with a delegation of local dignitaries invited by the company manager Mr. F.C. Hanning The trial car arrived at the Camborne terminus at 11.30am driven by the manager, accompanied by William Ward, the electrical engineer. The West Briton and Cornwall Advertiser for 9 October 1902 reported that those passengers who caught hold of a certain brass rod, to get on to the car, experienced a mild electric shock, the effect of which caused them to quickly release their hold, and this brought a smile to the face of Engineer Ward. The Board of Trade Inspector passed the tramway for use on 25 October 1902. The formal opening was held on 7 November 1902 when Mrs. Wigham, wife of an Edmundson's Director was the guest of honour. The tramway opened for passenger service on 7 November 1902, and for freight in May 1903. Vehicles were obtained from G.F. Milnes & Co. in 1902 and 1903, and comprised 6 open top double deck cars (48-seaters), 2 single-deck cars (34-seaters) plus 2 freight locomotives. The company livery was dark green and cream. Between 7 November 1902 and 30 September 1903 the passenger service carried one million passengers. The freight locomotives moved 12 ore wagons on the tramway from East Pool mine. Closure Around 1926, the Cornish Motor Transport Company inaugurated a 15-minute bus service between Redruth and Camborne, which reduced the patronage of the passenger tram service. Despite a reduction in fares and an amended service, it was not commercially viable and the service closed to passengers on 29 September 1927. The freight services continued. In August 1934 the freight service of tin ore was replaced by an aerial ropeway.

Design and development The Seahawk features a cable-braced hang glider-style high wing, weight-shift controls, a two-seats-in-tandem, open cockpit, a trimaran hull and a single engine in pusher configuration. The aircraft hull is made from fiberglass, with stainless steel fittings. The wing and its supporting structure are made from bolted-together aluminum tubing, with the single surface wing covered in Dacron sailcloth and supported by a single tube-type kingpost. The Seahawk uses an \\"A\\" frame control bar for weight-shift control. The hull was carefully designed to account for the inherent lack of pitch control that trikes have while on the water. It was designed to reduce porpoising and water spray being thrown into the crew seats and propeller. The hull also provides lift in flight and allows flight at reduced power and fuel consumption. The retractable landing gear is of tricycle configuration and is mechanically retracted by a lever located next to the pilot. The nosewheel retracts in front of the bow of the hull, while the main landing gear retracts beside the tri-hull.

She was best known for her work in advocacy planning, a type of urban planning which seeks social change by including all interests and groups in the planning process. Peattie, who earned her Ph.D. from University of Chicago in 1968, published extensively on slums and squatter settlements. She also engaged in numerous peace actions, and had a long, although minor and nonviolent, arrest record. Biography Born in Chicago, she was brought up partly in Mexico, in Morelos and Yucat√°n, where her parents were conducting fieldwork. Her grandfather, Robert E. Park, was an American urban sociologist who worked with Booker T Washington (with whom he shared a fascination with cities and the theory of cities) at the Tuskegee Institute. Together they searched for \\"The Man Farthest Down\\".\\"The man farthest down: a record of observation and study in Europe\\", Booker T. Washington, Robert Ezra Park, Doubleday & Co., New York, 1912 He later taught at the University of Chicago on the theory of urban ecology. Her father, Robert Redfield, an anthropologist also at the University of Chicago, had an interest in tracing connections ‚Äì between archeology, anthropological linguistics, physical anthropology, cultural anthropology, and ethnology in a synthesis of disciplines and between village cultures in his fieldwork. She began her anthropological life in 1948 with the Fox Project, which began as a summer of fieldwork for six Chicago graduate students, at Meskwaki Settlement in Iowa, and which, with the encouragement of Sol Tax, became a decade-long effort to redefine anthropology not as pure science, but as part of the human and moral landscape, in what he called \\"action anthropology\\", and which was later to reappear in her urban planning work as \\"advocacy planning\\". In 1943 she married Roderick Elia Peattie. She published two children‚Äôs books with him: The Law\\"The Law: What It is and How It Works\\", Peattie, Rod and Lisa, Henry Schuman, New York 1952 and The City,\\"The City\\", Peattie, Rod And Lisa Henry Schuman,, NY: 1952 which began her lifelong study of cities. In 1962 Lisa and Roderick Peattie were hired by the Harvard‚ÄìMIT Joint Center for Urban Studies, under a contract with the Venezuelan government, as project anthropologist and architect respectively, to help plan the city of Guayana, near the junction of the Orinoco and the Caroni rivers in the interior of Venezuela. They were the only members of the team to live on the site; the rest of the design team worked on the project from the capitol, Caracas, 660 km away. She observed directly the effects of the then-new profession of Urban Planning as it was experienced by the planned-upon population; she reported this radicalizing experience in her first popular book: The View from the Barrio. Peattie at her home in Venezuela with her family. Roderick Peattie died in Venezuela, in a car accident in 1963. Lisa Peattie returned to the United States, where she taught urban planning at MIT until her retirement. In 1966 she, with other faculty and students of M.I.T. and Harvard, organized Urban Planning Aid. This organization was to offer assistance to local residents against highway construction, and housing problems. It took an active part in the urban renewal fights and the Freeway and expressway revolts of the 1960s and 1970s. In the course of these anti-development struggles, she began a study and critique of conventional economic theory, which was strongly pro-development. She inspired activists in such widely varied subjects as poverty and conviviality. She also was involved in the Homeless Empowerment Project, and in the creation of \\"Spare Change News\\", a street newspaper whose mission is \\"to present, by our own example, that homeless and economically disadvantaged people, with the proper resources, empowerment, opportunity, and encouragement are capable of creating change for ourselves in society.\\" She also became involved in the fight against nuclear arms.

It is located on the border of the Oak Park and Highland Park neighborhoods. The commercial historic district has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1998. The Highland Park neighborhood also includes the College Corner Commercial Historic Business District. History Des Moines was growing in a northward direction in the late 19th century with the establishment of the city of North Des Moines. with Developers extended that growth in the late 1880s by developing Oak Park and Highland Park across the Des Moines River. They built a bridge at Sixth Avenue, a zoo on the river lowlands and Highland Park College, a non-denominational institution. They also lobbied to have a streetcar built to their development. The river bridge made Sixth Avenue a major farm-to-city road when there were few bridges over the Des Moines River north of the city. The business district itself has the appearance of the downtown of a modest-sized Iowa town. It had banks, fraternal halls, a fire station, post office, local newspapers, department stores, a variety of retail stores as well as other businesses. Most of the business lived a rather short life, but a few lasted for a couple of generations. The first bank in Des Moines outside of downtown was located here. A streetcar line served the district and it was on a major farm-to-city road. The historic district lies along Sixth Avenue, which is the north‚Äìsouth border of the Highland Park and Oak Park neighborhoods. Both neighborhoods are located on a plateau three miles north of downtown Des Moines. It is considered one of the highest spots in the city. ‚ÄúHighland Park‚Äù was chosen for the name of the historic district because it became the more dominant of the two neighborhoods starting in the early 20th century. From its very beginning the business district was organized under the title of Highland Park Business Men's Club. Most of the buildings in the historic district cluster at the intersection with Euclid Avenue. Only six of the properties are not oriented in some way on Sixth Avenue, which is the primary street in the district. All the buildings are brick commercial structures that were built from the early 1890s to just after World War II. The buildings built from the 1920s on were, for the most part, built along Euclid Avenue. Euclid was transformed from a residential street into a state highway at this time. Highland Park is the largest neighborhood-centered commercial district in the Des Moines area. The district remains largely intact with only a few lots that are vacant. Two of the lots were the location of large frame commercial buildings, which had to be replaced. One lot is vacant while the other is occupied by an infill building. Architecture The buildings in the historic district fall into three classifications. The older buildings, which were built between the early 1890s and 1907, are first generation brick buildings in the High Victorian style. They tend toward exaggerated ornamentation on the fa√ßade. The windows are narrower and feature window surrounds, narrow storefronts and either cast iron or stone storefront supports. The last buildings in this group replaced older structures that were destroyed in a fire in 1906. It was the only major fire in the district. Corbelled brickwork replaced the tin work, stone and terra cotta of the older buildings. The second group of buildings was built between 1915 and the mid-1920s. The automobile was growing in importance and these buildings reflect that development. The design flow of the buildings is more horizontal and the window openings are broader and simpler. The decorative elements were constructed with stone or concrete inserts and string courses. The last group was built in the late 1920s to the years right after World War II. The architecture is a continence of the second group and was influenced by the Modern architectural style. Ornamental materials utilized in the construction include glazed tile, Carrara glass, aluminum, and steel. The buildings in this latter group are all one-story, but one.

IEEE Smart Grid encompasses an array of activities, including development of new smart grid-related standards, best practices, publications, and conferences and educational opportunities.  History  IEEE's involvement in the emerging smart grid reaches back to its development of power and energy standards. In 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) was signed into law by President George W. Bush. EISA directed that under the auspices of the US Department of Energy (US DOE), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) be tasked with the development of a framework including protocols and model standards for information management to achieve interoperability of smart grid devices and systems. In Title XIII, Section 1305(a)(2) of EISA, IEEE was named as one of the Standard Setting Organizations (SSOs) whose work would be vital in the development of standards for NIST's Smart Grid Interoperability Framework.Updegrove, Andrew. Standards and the Smart Grid: The U.S. Experience, Standards Today, Vol VIII No 3, April - May, 2009. As part of the first phase of NIST's Smart Grid Interoperability Framework, 16 initial standards were offered for adoption, including three developed by IEEE: C37.118, IEEE 1547, and IEEE 1686-2007. In May 2009, IEEE announced the launch of a new smart grid effort targeted to the power engineering, communications, and information technology disciplines. The first project in this effort, titled \\"The IEEE Standard 2030 Guide for Smart Grid Interoperability of Energy Technology and Information Technology Operation with the Electric Power System (EPS) and End-Use Applications and Loads\\" (IEEE 2030) established a knowledge framework for understanding and defining smart grid interoperability of the electric power system with end use applications, setting the stage for future smart grid-related standards. In January 2010, IEEE launched the first phase of IEEE Smart Grid, a new global initiative designed to bring together the organization's broad array of resources to provide expertise and guidance for those involved in Smart Grid worldwide. Later that year, IEEE published inaugural editions of two new publications, cross-discipline archival journals entitled IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid, and IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy.  Current work  IEEE's approach to the smart grid is to view it as a large \\"System of Systems\\" wherein individual smart grid domains based on the NIST Smart Grid Conceptual Model are expanded into three layers: Power and Energy, Communications, and IT/Computer. IEEE considers the Communications and IT/Computer layers to be enabling infrastructure for the Power and Energy layer. = IEEE Smart Grid Portal = As part of the first phase of IEEE Smart Grid, IEEE unveiled the IEEE Smart Grid Portal in January 2010. As originally designed, the site served as an online clearinghouse providing smart grid-focused news, information, commentary, videos, and event information for a broad audience including business and industry, academic, and government users, as well as consumers. The portal is also home to the initiative's monthly digest, the IEEE Smart Grid Newsletter.Amin, Massoud. Welcome to the IEEE Smart Grid Newsletter, IEEE Smart Grid Newsletter, January 2011. The IEEE Smart Grid Portal was relaunched in September 2011. The redesigned site included improved search capabilities and other new features, such as a broader selection of video interviews and Q&A;'s with industry experts, business leaders, and researchers. It also facilitated greater user access to approved and in- development IEEE smart grid standards and an expanded conference calendar. = Standards = IEEE continues to work closely with NIST on its standards roadmap and conformance testing/certification framework for the smart grid. The organization also collaborates with other global standards bodies to effectively facilitate standards coordination and to ensure the intensifying smart grid movement‚Äôs success. There are more than 100 standards that have been approved or in development relating to the smart grid. Among the broad number of systems and technologies addressed by these standards are broadband over power line, cyber security, distributed energy resources, Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3), and Greenhouse gas emissions credits, among others.

In 1903, Proctor joined George Washington Henderson, president of Straight University, a black college in New Orleans, to found the National Convention of Congregational Workers Among Colored People, and Proctor became its first president. In 1904, Clark University awarded Proctor a Doctor of Divinity degree. After the Atlanta Race Riot in 1906, Proctor and a white attorney worked together to quell remaining tensions and formed the Interracial Committee of Atlanta. In the church, Proctor provided amenities lacking in the black community such as a library, a kindergarten, an employment bureau, a gymnasium, a ladies‚Äô reading parlor, a music room, counseling services, and a model kitchen and sewing room for girls. He also helped open the first housing facility for young employed black women. Proctor was a strong believer in self-improvement. Proctor also founded the Atlanta Colored Music Festival Association, with concerts attended by both races, segregated but under one roof, believing that music could quell racial animosity.\\"Atlanta Colored Music Festival Association\\", New Georgia Encyclopedia This festival continues to the present day as the Atlanta Music Festival.

Often the salute is performed for a crewmember's family. The practice dates back to ancient times. In Italy, massive ships regularly came very close to shorelines or jetties in the Mediterranean, including the island of Procida, off the Amalfi coast, and Sicily. Some U.S.-based cruise lines have been reluctant to answer questions pertaining to what extent salutes are performed today. Passenger ship historian and writer Peter Knego says that salutes are still performed whether approved by cruise companies or not.

Howard's sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It was first published in trade paperback by Tor Books in October 1983, and was reprinted in 1991; a regular paperback edition followed from the same publisher in April 1985, and was reprinted in January 1987, May 1991 and February 2011. The first British edition was published in paperback by Sphere Books in November 1985; a later British edition was published in paperback by Legend Books in April 1997. The novel was later gathered together with Conan the Magnificent and Conan the Destroyer into the hardcover omnibus collection The Conan Chronicles II (Legend, April 1997), and was later gathered together with Conan the Magnificent and Conan the Victorious into the hardcover omnibus collection The Further Chronicles of Conan (Tor Books, October 1999). Plot Conan guides his army of mercenaries into Ianthe, capital of Ophir, where they become entangled in the chaos ensuing from the death of King Valdric. The factions of Antimides, Valentius, and Lady Synelle (Countess of Asmark) all contest for the throne. Synelle is secretly a sorceress and the high priestess of a nearly-forgotten demon god known as Al‚ÄôKiir. Al‚ÄôKiir was imprisoned within the depths of a mountain, called Tor Al‚ÄôKiir, centuries before by a mage named Avanrakash. However, Synelle plans on releasing him by providing Al'Kiir a ‚Äúbride‚Äù through human sacrifice and enlist his power in obtaining the throne. Conan comes into Synelle's attention after he buys an idol of Al‚ÄôKiir, which she believes can be used in reviving her god. She plan on obtaining the idol, sending various agents to steal it and bewitching the Cimmerian into enlisting in her service. This attachment is complicated by Conan's interest in Julia, a young noblewoman reduced to trulldom, and his old rival, a female bandit named Karela the Red Hawk, one of many thieves Synelle has hired to steal the idol. Ultimately, Synelle's true colors are revealed. In the depths of Tor Al‚ÄôKirr, she and her priestess attempt to sacrifice Karela to raise the demon. Conan and his company battle her forces and the Cimmerian wins through‚Äîjust too late. Al‚ÄôKiir is raised, but takes Synelle instead of his intended victim. When the demon turns its attention towards Karela, Conan seizes the Staff of Avanrakash and spears the creature. At its unearthly screams, Synelle's defenders flee. Both Al'kiir and the captive sorceress harden into stone as the mountain begins to rumble. Conan and his men flee, putting as much distance as they can between themselves and the mountain before it erupts in a pillar of flame resembling the staff. In the aftermath, the victorious army of Valentius marches onto Ianthe. The remnants of the Free Company, sidelined, break up, each going their separate way. Conan urges Karela to go to Argos with him, but she refuses, preferring her free life instead being mastered by the Cimmerian. He proceeds south alone. Meanwhile, Synelle is rescued from the destroyed mountain and brought back to life by Thoth-Amon.

Mahmud Ali ‚Äì Google Books the first successful joint army-navy-air force military operation in Bangladesh, earning him the Bangladesh Army's highest operational medal the Jatiyo Nirapatya Padak. While commanding the Chittagong Area, he also served as the ex officio Commandant of the East Bengal Regimental Centre (EBRC) ‚Äì a position nicknamed \\"Papa Tiger\\". In August 1975 Dastgir was promoted to the rank of major general, the highest rank possible in the Bangladesh Army at that time, and continued to command 65 Infantry Brigade (making him Bangladesh Army's first formation commander to hold the rank of General) until November 1975 when he was appointed chief of the border forces as Director General of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR). In November 1975, Dastgir was given the additional responsibility to serve as the first Zonal Martial Law Administrator (ZMLA) (i.e., the de facto military governor) for Dhaka Division, one of the four administrative provinces of the country. In 1977 he founded the Rifles Public School at BDR Headquarters and this is now one of the leading academic institutions in the Bangladesh capital Dhaka. ZMLA Dastgir headed a review of the tea industry and the Dastgir Tea Commission (as his review came to be known) forgave outstanding bank loans taken by Bangladesh tea gardens before independence in 1971 ‚Äì thereby reviving the tea industry in the country. During this time he led the Bangladesh delegation for border talks with India held in Calcutta in 1975 and New Delhi in 1976.MEA  MEA Links : Indian Missions Abroad The border talks had followed Dastgir's successful counter-offensive against Indian incursions in Bangladesh's Mymensingh border with India ‚Äì and this military operation got him his second Jatiyo Nirapatya Padak. Bangladesh Foreign Service (1977‚Äì1991) Despite ample opportunities, Dastgir refused to do politics in uniform and requested to be relieved of his role as ZMLA of Dhaka Division to enable him to focus on his military duties just as the Chief of Army Staff General Ziaur Rahman took over as President of Bangladesh. In December 1977, he was transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a full, permanent Secretary to the Government of Bangladesh. Dastgir was appointed the Ambassador of Bangladesh to Thailand (and later concurrently accredited to the Philippines) in May 1978 and served till June 1982. During this time he also served as his country's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). As the country's Permanent Representative to ESCAP, Dastgir played a key role in the election of Bangladesh Foreign Secretary Shah A M S Kibria as the Executive Secretary of the United Nations commission. It was at a reception at his house in Bangkok, Thailand that he broached the idea of an association of South Asian nations in the ASEAN model to the Bhutanese Foreign Minister, and this started discussions which led to the proclamation of SAARC (the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) by Bangladesh President Ziaur Rahman, after extensive diplomatic groundwork done by Dastgir's brother-in-law then Bangladesh Foreign Secretary Ambassador Humayun Rasheed ChoudhuryHUMAYUN RASHEED CHOUDHURY ‚Äì 41st Session who went on to become the President of the 41st UN General Assembly. General Dastgir's term as Ambassador to Thailand coincided with renowned US Ambassador Morton Abramowitz, and during this time General Dastgir often took advice on foreign service approaches from another soldier turned diplomat, Philippine Foreign Minister Carlos Romulo. From 1982 to 1983 he served as Ambassador of Bangladesh to Pakistan. On 26 March 1983, Ambassador Dastgir gave a televised speech aired on Pakistan Television (PTV), addressing multifarious bilateral issues between Bangladesh and Pakistan. This helped normalise relations with Pakistan and eventually led to the re- admittance of Pakistan in the British Commonwealth at the recommendation of Bangladesh. From 1984 to 1988 the general served as the High Commissioner of Bangladesh to AustraliaThe Sydney Morning Herald ‚Äì Google News Archive Searchhttp://www.slwa.wa.gov.au/pdf/ephemera/pr11148.pdf with concurrent accreditation to New Zealand, Papua New Guineahttp://www.dtic.mil/cgi- bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA341261 and Fiji. In 1984 he attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting in Papua New Guinea, and served as the leader of the Bangladesh delegation to the Tenth Asian and Pacific Labour Ministers Conference held in Melbourne in October 1985. Later that year (1985), he led the Bangladesh delegation to the 44th International Cotton Advisory Committee meeting held in Sydney from 28 October to 1 November. In 1988 he was appointed Ambassador of Bangladesh to Saudi Arabiahttp://www.dtic.mil/cgi- bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc;=GetTRDoc.pdf&AD;=ADA343489 with concurrent accreditation to Jordan, Niger and Yemen. During this time, General Dastgir also served as the Permanent Representative of Bangladesh to the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), and the Saudi Fund for Development. As the country's Permanent Representative to the OIC, Dastgir played a key role in the election of Bangladeshi candidate Ambassador Mohammad Mohsin as the Deputy Secretary General of the organisation.http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA336117 During his tenure to Saudi Arabia, Dastgir was instrumental in the decision of the Government of Bangladesh to send a contingent of troops, consisting of the First East Bengal Regiment (his own battalion) as part of Operation Desert Storm. This was Bangladesh's first participation in an international military coalition, and paved the way for the Bangladesh Armed Forces to take part in future United Nations peacekeeping operations across various world theatres. At this time Dastgir gave an interview to the Voice of America and spoke about regional security, including the steps taken by the Saudi Government to ensure the safety of Bangladesh nationals affected by the first Gulf War.A tribute to General Dastgir ‚Äì Dhaka Courier  HighBeam Research For his distinguished services as the Ambassador of Bangladesh to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Dastgir was decorated in 1991 with the King Abdul Aziz Order Class 1 by (then) King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. In September 1991, Dastgir retired from the Government of Bangladesh after completing a career spanning 41 years. Retirement (1991‚Äì2008) Dastgir remained active in military and diplomatic circles after retirement, and spoke at many public forums. In 1996 he was widely rumoured to be under consideration to take part in the first neutral Caretaker Government which officiated during national elections. Instead, he was nominated by the Jatiyo Party to contest the parliamentary elections from a Dhaka constituency. During this time he was exclusively interviewed by CNN's South Asia Anchor Anita Pratap for a worldwide broadcast in 1996. Despite the election victory of an opponent, Dastgir gained wide popularity in the constituency for his bold yet statesmanlike campaign. He was appointed a Presidium Member of the Jatiyo Party and served as the chief foreign policy advisor to former President H. M. Ershad. In 2002 Dastgir resigned his membership in the Jatiyo Party due to policy differences with the party leadership. In 1997, he was elected chairman of the Retired Armed Forces Officers Welfare Association (RAOWA) ‚Äì Bangladesh's only veteran's association for army, navy and air force officers‚Äîand served a two-year term. Elected to the Bangladesh chapter of the Royal Commonwealth Society in 1998, Dastgir served as its Presidium Member and Vice-President until 2005.The Daily Star Web Edition Vol. 4 Num 339The Daily Star Web Edition Vol. 5 Num 523 He had been handpicked by General M. A. G. Osmani to serve as a member of the Osmany Trust created to look after the estate of the former Commander-in-Chief of the Bangladesh Liberation forces. Dastgir remained an active member of the trust until 2008. His health began to fail abruptly in 2005 after he attended the 100th Reunion of the Command and Staff College in Quetta following a personal invitation by Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf. Personal life In 1965 Dastgir married Kohinoor Rasheed Choudhury, the daughter of industrialist-cum- legislator and Member of British India's Central Legislative Assembly Abdur Rasheed Choudhury and Member of the Pakistan National Assembly Serajunnessa Choudhury of Sylhet, East Pakistan (currently Bangladesh). Mrs. Dastgir is a social worker and recipient of the International Red Cross Gold Medal. Their son Quazi Rumman Dastgir is a U.S. diplomat and their daughter Ayesha Dastgir is an international civil servant. Death and legacy In September 2008, Dastgir fell seriously ill with undiagnosed ailments and had to be hospitalised for about a month. He returned home on 10 October 2008. He died in his sleep at his Dhaka residence on 17 October 2008.Quazi Golam Dastgir After funeral services attended by top defence and civilian officials, he was buried in the national army cemetery in Dhaka (the Cantonment Graveyard). Dastgir was one of the best known Bengali army officers of his time ‚Äì and was apparently considered by the CIA to be the most likely person to lead the Bangladesh Army in case of war. Following his active military service, he had a distinguished career as a diplomat during his four terms as ambassador. Described as an \\"upright officer of the old school\\", he held conservative views with a strong belief in civilian governance which might have been a product of his US training, and these convictions may have been a deterrent to his rise to the pinnacle of political power.

It was founded in 1999 by Late Rev. Fr. Bernard D‚ÄôSouza under the Catholic Board of Education, of the Diocese of Mangalore, a religious and linguistic minority institution. History Fr. Bernard D'Souza initiated the project of providing Catholic students with an education in the CBSE syllabus in order to prepare them for competitive exams and also for children of Mangalorean Catholics abroad who require a CBSE education. He started English medium classes in kindergarten and Standard I in 1999 at the Bejai Church Commercial Complex. In the meantime the southern portion of the church-owned land was leveled. At the extreme end a large building was erected with three stories on the eastern end and with a single story at the western end. The Principal's office, school office, and six kindergarten class rooms were constructed on the ground floor. On the first floor, various other class rooms, a library, a computer room and an auditorium were built. The school received permission to conduct classes up to Standard IV, but only in the Kannada medium. Fr. Bernard D'Souza was later transferred, and in May 2003, Fr. Joseph Peter Tauro was appointed parish priest of Bejai as well as the manager of Lourdes Central School. By then, the school had received permission to conduct classes up to Standard VI, in Kannada medium as per government policy. Thereafter an application was made for educating students in the English medium. Permission was granted by the government education department (No: 134-2003-04) on 28 November 2003 through the efforts of Sr. Benny Pinto. Shortly afterwards, the school received an NOC from the government dated 29 November 2003 to run under the CBSE syllabus. The school then applied for affiliation to the CBSE, New Delhi. The commission began the inspection of the school on 27 October 2004 to ensure conformity with the CBSE requirements. John Sharma of Ghaziabad, Fr. Cyril Sequeira of Meerut, and Vivian Sequeira of Bejai parish assisted the school authorities in the inspection. The Affiliation No. 830120/2005-06, dated 10 January 2005, was issued to the school with a validity of three years. In May 2011, all Lourdes Central candidates taking the class 12 CBSE exams passed. Simultaneously, additional facilities were developed; two floors were constructed above the auditorium. On the second floor laboratories for physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics were built, as well as a computer room. A large library was also constructed. The remaining rooms on the second and third floors were developed as classrooms. On the third floor an A. V. room was made. Adjoining the school, an administrative block was built which housed the Principal's Chamber, a conference room and lobby on the ground floor and the Vice Principals office and staff room the first floor. The administrative block and all other facilities were blessed by Rev. Dr. Aloysius Paul D'Souza, Bishop of Mangalore and inaugurated by Mr. Oscar Fernandes, M.P. on 13 March 2005. The cost of developing these infrastructural facilities amounted to 1.5 crore rupees.

Levinson in 1973 in the aftermath of Yom Kippur War when Levinson was temporarily blind at the time, having been injured during the war. The Hebrew lyrics are by Hamutal Ben Zeev- Efron. The song is a tribute to a fallen Israeli soldier. The lyrics written by Hamutal Ben Zeev-Efron are inspired by the Isaiah (2:4) that says \\"And they shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they teach their children war anymore\\". At a later stage, the English lyrics were added, which are not direct translations, but whole new lyrics. They are written by Lisa- Catherine Cohen for the main text and by Harry Lewis, the latter contributing the bridge. Through Ms. Cohen in California, Hal Leonard/Cherry Lane Music, a large sheet music publishing company, acquired the sheet music rights, helping to distribute the song through its vast network. \\"Lay Down Your Arms\\" has been performed by many children's and adult choirs, and audiences throughout Canada, the United States and Israel. It has been sung by congregations in synagogues and churches, as well as schools, camps and many social occasions. The song has been used in a number of films and features and has been broadcast on radio and television in Canada and the United States, and is a regular feature on Israel television's Yom Hazikaron broadcasts. Composition Doron Levinson was commanding a tank battalion in the Israeli Army (IDF) when one of his men confided in him his belief that this would be his last battle. Doron calmed the nervous soldier down, assuring him they would return from this encounter unscathed. But, Doron was wrong, and his soldier's premonition was accurate. In a fierce tank battle, his gunner was killed and Doron himself was temporarily blinded. During his convalescence at an Israeli hospital, Doron, unable to see, found himself with time on his hands. On one of the hospital pianos, he found his fingers tracing out a melody expressing his anguish over his fallen comrade, and over other close friends he had lost in previous battles. Levinson, a former soldier, graduated with a Ph.D from the University of Toronto becoming an instructor of Hebrew, and Jewish studies at Toronto's Temple Sinai Hebrew School. A multi-talented individual, musician and composer, a storyteller, he was convinced of the critical role music plays in the life of people, particularly children. When he learned about the March of the Living, an international campaign to organize trips for Jewish children from around the world to visit Poland, and the former Nazi concentration camps there, and then to Israel, Doron met with Canadian March of the Living director, Eli Rubenstein. He asked him to consider including, in his March of the Living programming, the song Levinson had written, as a testament to all those dying in wars, and as a plea for peace and end to military conflict. In 1990, Toronto's Habonim Youth Choir, founded by Esther Ghan Firestone and Eli Rubenstein, recorded the song in Hebrew with Firestone conducting the choir. Since many of the students did not understand the lyrics an English adaptation was deemed necessary. Rubenstein approached two songwriters, Lisa-Catherine Cohen and Harry Lewis to write an English adaptation, with Cohen writing the body of the lyrics, and Lewis contributing the bridge. The song was retitled \\"Lay Down Your Arms\\". In 1992, a video of the song was produced. In popular culture *Toronto's Habonim Youth Choir, conducted by Esther Ghan Firestone, the cantor of Toronto's Congregation Habonim, recorded the song in Hebrew. In 1992 a music video was released in addition to lyrics in English with some Hebrew verses. The choir was conducted by Esther Ghan Firestone and directed by Eli Rubenstein. The soloist in the video was 17-year-old Tara Strong (then Charendoff) who sang the part in the early 1990s when she was still attending high school in Toronto. The video was directed by Yehoram Pirotsky *Roots Canada launched a special promotion, producing a \\"Lay Down Your Arms\\" T-shirts and sweatshirts featuring a dove in the design. It also offered a free cassette of the song to each of its customers who purchased one. *In the spring of 1995, several schools and religious institutions around the world commemorated the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Nazi death camps and the end of World War II with a performance of \\"Lay Down Your Arms\\". *In 2000, it was performed by the 60-voice choir of the University of Judaism in Los Angeles at the memorial for the children shot at California's Northridge Community Center.

The arrangement was by Eldad Shrim, who also served as musical producer and conducted the New Haifa Symphony Orchestra for this project. The song and video clip were produced by Doron B. Levinson. *2015 Recording of ‚ÄúLay Down Your Arms‚Äù: To mark the 70th anniversary of the end of WWII in Europe, the March of the Living Children‚Äôs Choir, joined by the Habonim Youth Choir, recorded a new version of ‚ÄúLay Down Your Arms‚Äù. Cantor Aviva Rajsky and guitarist Tom Bellman - from Toronto‚Äôs Congregation Habonim, who both accompanied the 2015 March of the Living - composed a new arrangement for the song. It was first performed on Holocaust Remembrance Day, at the 2015 March of the Living ceremony in Auschwitz-Birkenau. *In Nov. 2015, the more modern version of the song was released along with a music video. The new video and sheet music were sent to schools, with the suggestion they play the video during 2015 Remembrance Day commemorations and learn the song for future memorial events. The new music video included portions of the song performed in 2015 on Holocaust Remembrance Day at Auschwitz-Birkenau, at the Tempel Synagogue in Krakow and in Israel near Latrun, between Yom Hazikaron, which honours Israel‚Äôs war dead, and Yom Ha‚Äôatzmaut, Israel‚Äôs Independence Day.

According to the advocacy group Survival International, reporting local sources, he was one of two leaders who were abducted in August 2010 after they had been peacefully protesting a bauxite mine that Vedanta Resources and the Government of Odisha proposed to create on land upon which the tribe traditionally depended. Some reports at the time suggested he was being held by the police, though the police themselves refuse to confirm this. In August 2010, Lodu Sikaka claimed that he was abducted for a few hours by some unknown people who, he later alleged, were policemen.

There are 3 versions of the game: Spark and Bomber, released on July 1, 2010 in Japan, followed in December 16, 2010 by The Ogre. All three versions of this game were included in an updated re- release compilation titled Inazuma Eleven 1-2-3: Endo Mamoru's Legend for the Nintendo 3DS, released on December 27, 2012 in Japan. They were later released separately in Europe both digitally and physically, as \\"Lightning Bolt\\" (originally \\"Spark\\") and \\"Bomb Blast\\" (originally \\"Bomber\\") in Europe on September 27, 2013. The release of the third version, as \\"Team Ogre Attacks!\\", followed on February 13, 2014. Plot Coach Hibiki gathers Japan's greatest football players from all over Japan (many of these players are featured in the first 2 seasons). The team (below) is mainly made up of players from Raimon/The Ultimate Eleven and Aliea Academy, however there is the inclusion of Sakuma from Teikoku Academy and Hijikata. There are also two newcomers to this game which are Utsunomiya Tormaru and Tobitaka Seiya. The players divide into 2 teams. One led by Endou and the other by Kidou. At the end of the game (In the anime) Endou's team wins by 3-2, including goals from Hiroto, Gouenji, Someoka, Reize and Fubuki. However, many of Kidou's team managed to make the team anyway, including Fudou, Gouenji, Tachimukai and Kidou himself. When the practice match is over Inazuma Japan's new coach is revealed to be Kudou Michiya and his daughter Fuyuka decides to become a manager for Inazuma Japan. Later the draw for the Asia preliminary matches is done, revealing that Japan had drawn against one of the favorites: Australia's team, Big Waves. With 2 days until the game with Australia, coach Kudou refuses to allow the team to practice and they must stay inside all day! However Tsunami manages to escape and perfects a new hissatsu technique \\"The Typhoon\\" which he uses to score past Australia. But the rest of the players had to resort to practicing in their rooms. We discover that this is what coach Kudou had wished for the team to do in order to beat Australia's Box-Lock Defence, this allowed them to beat this by practicing in such a tight confined space such as a room, for them to be able to keep close control of the ball, the player to realize this first is Kidou. This game finished 2-1 to Japan thanks to Gouenji's newly discovered hissatsu technique \\"Bakunetsu Screw\\". Development At Japan Expo 2013, producer Akihiro Hino confirmed that the \\"Spark\\" (renamed \\"Lightning Bolt\\") and \\"Bomber\\" (renamed \\"Bomb Blast\\") versions would be released for Nintendo 3DS in Europe on September 27, 2013. The third version (renamed \\"Team Ogre Attacks!\\") was also announced during the Nintendo Direct on November 13, 2013, and was released on February 13, 2014.

In a career that lasted from April 1822 to May 1823 he ran five times and won four races. In 1822, when three years old, he won all three of his races and became the second of six colts owned by members of the British Royal Family to win The Derby. His subsequent career was restricted by injuries and he was retired after sustaining his only defeat. He had limited success as a sire of winners and was exported to Germany in 1830. Background Moses was bred and owned by the Duke of York, the heir presumptive who raced under the name of his friend \\"Mr. Greville\\". The Duke had previously won the Derby in 1816 with Prince Leopold. Moses was foaled at one of the Duke's studs, either at Hampton Court or Oatlands, and was reportedly one of his favourite horses. Both Moses and Prince Leopold were trained by William Butler. The identity of Moses's father is uncertain. His dam, an unnamed mare by Gohanna, was covered by two stallions, first Whalebone and then Seymour in the spring of 1818. A second covering would usually take place only if the first was thought to have been unsuccessful. The fact that Moses was usually described as being by the former may simply reflect the fact that Whalebone was the much more successful and famous of the two stallions. Whalebone won the 1810 Derby and thirteen other races before becoming a successful and important stallion. He was British Champion sire in 1826 and 1827 and through his son Sir Hercules, is the male- line ancestor of most modern Thoroughbreds. The Gohanna mare went on to produce the filly Rachel, a highly successful racehorse whose wins included the Oatlands Stakes. Racing career =1822: three-year-old season= Moses was unraced as a two-year-old but had acquired enough of a reputation to be regarded as one of the leading contenders for the Derby before the season began. He made his racecourse debut on 23 April 1822 at Newmarket. He was made the 6/4 favourite for a six furlong Sweepstakes and claimed the 200-guinea prize, beating two opponents. Although he won easily, the quality of the beaten horses was questionable. The \\"desperate\\" finish of the 1822 Derby On 23 May at Epsom Moses started 6/1 third favourite in a twelve-runner field for the Derby, with Hampden being made the 3/1 favourite. The early running was made by an outsider named Wanton who led until the turn into the straight but then veered off the course and into the crowd. The closing stages were disputed by Moses, Hamden, Figaro and an unnamed \\"brother to Antonio\\". After a \\"most desperate struggle\\", Moses, ridden by Thomas Goodisson, won by half a neck from Figaro, with Hampden a length away in third. Wearing the colours of the Duke of York in the race, Moses gave the Duke his second victory, and the third for the royal family, at the Derby. The race was described in a contemporary source as \\"the best Derby ever run.\\" Moses reappeared at Ascot on 5 June for the one mile Albany Stakes. Despite carrying a five pounds weight penalty for winning the Derby he started odds on favourite and won \\"very cleverly\\" from Stamford. Following this race, Moses began to have training problems, developing \\"sand-cracks\\" in his hooves which prevented him from running again in 1822. Moses was scheduled to appear in a match race at Newmarket in October against a four-year-old colt called Black-and-all-black (who was black). He failed to appear for the match, allowing the owners of his opponent to claim the stake money. =1823: four-year-old season= Moses maintained his winning run on his four-year-old debut. On 17 April at the Newmarket Craven meeting he defeated five opponents, including the favourite Ajax, to win the Claret Stakes. The race attracted a great deal of interest ‚Äì it \\"filled the Town and the heath\\" ‚Äì and Goodisson was held to have ridden a particularly fine race on the winner. At the next Newmarket meeting Moses' owners claimed 200 guineas in prize money, when Ajax failed to appear for a scheduled match race. Three days later, Moses attempted to concede ten pounds to a colt named Macduff in a match race. The Derby winner's unbeaten record came to an end as Macduff won the 200 guinea match over Newmarket's Ditch Mile course. Moses did not appear to be fully fit for this race, and his training problems from the previous year were continuing to affect his performance. He was retired to stud without running again. Assessment The Sporting Magazine described Moses as a \\"trump\\" and one of the \\"first-rate horses\\" of the time. Stud career In his first season as a stallion, Moses was based at Bushey Park Paddocks, near Hampton Court. His fee for covering a mare was ten guineas, with a half a guinea for the groom. He may have sired one outstanding racehorse in Albert, a colt who was undefeated in a five-race career that included a win over Cadland in the Audley End Stakes at Newmarket in 1830. Albert's paternity however, was doubtful, as his dam was also covered by a stallion named Waterloo in the year of his conception. According to the General Stud Book, Moses was sold to the Duke of Holstein and exported in 1830. He was sold in November 1836 and died shortly after. Pedigree The following pedigree assumes that Moses was sired by Seymour.

The AAGPBL expansion brought two new franchises to the previous six-team format. At this point, the Muskegon Lassies and the Peoria Redwings joined the Fort Wayne Daisies, Grand Rapids Chicks, Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox. The eight teams competed through a 112 game schedule, while the final Shaugnessy playoffs faced season winner Racine against defending champion Rockford in a Best of Seven Series. Other modifications occurred in the league during 1946. The ball was decreased in size from 11¬Ω inches to 11 inches. In addition, the base paths were lengthened to 70 feet and the sidearm pitching was introduced, as the league was moving toward baseball.AAGPBL Rules of Play Several pitching records were set during the season. Racine's Anna Mae Hutchison recorded two marks that would never be broken: most innings pitched in a single game (19 against Peoria) and most games pitched in a single season (51). For their part, Fort Wayne's Dorothy Wiltse set the mark for more strikeouts in a season (294), and Racine's Joanne Winter a record for the most consecutive scoreless innings (63). The untiring Wiltse also pitched and won both games of a doubleheader (August 25).The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Softcover, 295pp. Language: English. Other highlights included Grand Rapids' Connie Wisniewski, who led all pitchers with a 0.96 earned run average. Besides this, Winter and Wisniewski combined for 33 wins a piece, the best ever in league history. In addition, Fort Wayne's Audrey Haine and South Bend's Doris Barr and Betty Luna hurled no-hitters. The only position player to top the .300 mark was Rockford's Dorothy Kamenshek (.316), proving that strong pitching is more important than having hot bats.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2000. Format: Softcover, 294pp. Language: English. The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League For the second consecutive season, one team won both the season title and the championship. Racine defeated South Bend in the first round, three games to one, and beat the defending champion Rockford in the best-of-seven series in six games. Racine was led by Winter, who won four games in the two playoffs, including a 15-inning, 1‚Äì0 victory in the final game of the Shaugnessy series. The Belles also received offensive support from Sophie Kurys, who batted an average of .372 (16-for-43) in 10 playoff games, while setting a postseason record with 16 stolen bases. Kurys also was honored with the AAGPBL Player of the Year Award, after hit a second-best .286 while leading with 201 stolen bases and 117 runs.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book In the first three years after World War II, AAGPBL teams often attracted between two and three thousand fans to a single game.

Games =Notable games= Tiny Tower Tiny Tower is a business simulation video game developed by NimbleBit for iOS and Android devices. In Tiny Tower, the player manages an expanding tower filled with virtual people, who are referred to as \\"Bitizens\\". The tower has multiple types of floors, all of which are randomly generated. The game is customizable, allowing the player to customize their Bitizens, repaint new floors, or even evict Bitizens. The goal of the game is to build the tallest of towers, which will attract Bitizens to move in and work in any floor the player designates. On February 7, 2012, Tiny Tower reached 10 million downloads, so Nimblebit gave all Tiny Tower users 10 free \\"tower bux\\". The game received a positive reception, reaching a score of 82/100 on Metacritic, with no negative reviews. In the App Store, Tiny Tower reached 4.5 / 5 stars, based on more than 155 thousand user reviews. The game has many aspects, such as active and passive playing and pixel art graphics, making the game successful with recognition that includes iPhone Game of the Week, and was elected by Apple as The Game of the Year for iPhone in 2011. Tiny Tower released on June 23, 2011 for iOS devices and on November 16, 2011 for Android devices. Pocket Frogs The aim is to earn money by breeding and selling one's own frogs. It has Game Center support. When the game begins, the player owns two frogs, a Cocos Bruna Anura and a Green Folium Anura, one regular habitat, a nursery habitat, and 1000 coins. In the pond view, players control their frog, eating flies to tame it, which makes it happy, breeding with other frogs players find, and finding presents. Presents include various breeds of frogs, potions (for quick frog growths and races), stamps (for quick delivery of mailbox items) and coins. Besides taming the frog, eating flies increases their happiness and, if they are not yet mature, can lessen the time left to maturation. The goal is to collect all 36,000 frogs available in-game. It was released on September 15, 2010 for iOS devices. The Android version (distributed by Mobage) was removed from the Google Play Store, but was re- released by NimbleBit with the removal of several features. Pocket Planes The player is in charge of an airline company. Similarly, one must purchase or construct airports, planes, and parts. The main gameplay is flying passengers and shipping cargo from one city to another. There are a total of 250 airports in the game, each based on real world locations. There are 60 different planes that carry passengers, cargo, or a combination of both passengers and cargo. The game bears several similarities to Tiny Tower in the use of its pixel world and \\"Bitizens\\". This game was released June 14, 2012 for iOS devices. Later the same year ported to Android by Mobage, who then dropped the app in late 2015. The game is no longer available for Android devices, and Nimblebit has stated there will be no attempts by them to change that. Pocket Trains Pocket Trains is a business simulation video game developed by NimbleBit for iOS and Android. It was developed before Pocket Planes and published on the App Store on 15 September 2013 for iOS. The player is in charge of a train company. Like Pocket Planes, the player must buy train stations and railway tracks. The main part of the game is transporting cargo around a simple map from one city to another. There are 27 trains which you unlock in crates.

Guzm√°n focuses on the similarities between astronomers researching humanity's past, in an astronomical sense, and the struggle of many Chilean women who still search, after decades, for the remains of their relatives executed during the dictatorship. Patricio Guzm√°n narrates the documentary himself and the documentary includes interviews and commentary from those affected and from astronomers and archeologists. As a filmmaker Patricio Guzm√°n's filmography has focused mostly on the political and social issues that have plagued Chile. He explored Chile under Salvador Allende and his government (Salvador Allende, 2004), and Pinochet's dictatorship and his human rights abuses (See Batalla de Chile [The Battle of Chile trilogy, 1975-1979], Le cas Pinochet [The Pinochet Case], 2001) and others. The latter film deals more so with the aftermath of those human rights abuses. Plot Nostalgia for the Light opens with a view of a telescope and images of our moon. The narrator, Patricio Guzm√°n, describes how he came to love astronomy and begins to remember his childhood during which ‚Äúonly the present moment existed.‚Äù Soon, Chile became the center of the world as astronomers and scientists flocked to Chile to observe the universe through the thin and clear skies. We next see Guzm√°n walking in the Atacama Desert, a place with absolutely no moisture, so much so that it resembles the surface of Mars. This desert, and its abundance of history, becomes the focus of the documentary. Because of how dry it is, the desert hosts the untouched remains of fish, mollusks, Indian carvings, and even mummified humans. Astronomer Gaspar Galaz is introduced and comments on how astronomy is a way to look into the past to understand our origins. It is generally a science seeking answers, but, in the process, creates more questions to answer. He comments that science in general, like astronomy and geology, is a look into the past; even sitting there having this interview, he comments, is a conversation in the past because of the millionths of a second light takes to travel and be processed. Lautaro N√∫√±ez relates astronomer's endeavors to his own; archeologists and astronomers have to recreate the past while in the present by using only a few traces. The documentary then shifts into Chile's recent past dealing with Pinochet and his dictatorship. Lu√≠s Henr√≠quez, a survivor from the Chacabuco concentration camp, describes how a group of about 20, led by a Doctor Alvarez (who was knowledgeable in astronomy), was taught theory during the day and learned how to identify constellations at night. They learned how to create a device that let them track the constellations, and while they studied the cosmos they ‚Äúall had a feeling of great freedom,‚Äù as Henr√≠quez describes it. The military, however, quickly banned these lessons because they believed the prisoners could escape using the constellations. Miguel Lawner, similarly, was a prisoner who survived the concentration camp. He is referred to as the ‚Äúarchitect‚Äù in the movie because he was able to memorize and then later recreate the environment the prisoners lived in. Miguel would measure buildings and the grounds with footsteps and would then draw a scaled version of the concentration camps with those measurements. He would rip his drawings up and hide them at night, in case of a raid, and then flush them down the latrines in the morning. The narrator concludes that he and his wife Anita are a metaphor for Chile: Henr√≠quez remembers what happened in the past, while Anita, who has Alzheimer's disease, is forgetting. Valentina Rodr√≠guez talks about how her grandparents were detained and threatened to give up the location of her parents. After threatening to hurt Valentina, her grandparents complied and her parents were taken away. This idea leaves her strong and optimistic. Guzm√°n ends the documentary affirming the value of memory because, as he states, ‚Äúthose who have a memory are able to live in the fragile present moments. Those who have none don't live anywhere.‚Äù Cast * Patricio Guzm√°n ‚Äì Narrator of documentary * Gaspar Galaz ‚Äì Professor of Astronomy at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile ( Universidad Cat√≥lica ).http://www.astro.puc.cl/~ggalaz/ * Lautaro N√∫√±ez ‚Äì Archeologist. * Lu√≠s Henr√≠quez ‚Äì Held in the Chacabuco concentration camp from Nov of 1973 to Oct of 1974.

As a result, scientists and astronomers from around the world travel to the desert and use it as a site to perform their own research. These astronomers are able to look clearly up into the sky and observe the universe that surrounds us to try to understand the origins of the cosmos. Similarly, the lack of humidity not only helps astronomers see the universe, but it helps archaeologists and Chileans access traces and remains of the past. The dry climate helps preserve these traces as if they were left untouched. Some Chileans are interested in these remnants, especially in finding the bodies of their loved ones who disappeared during the reign of Pinochet. Nostalgia for the Light (dir. Patricio Guzm√°n, 2010) focuses on the similarity: astronomers' desire to understand the past and origin of the universe and Chileans' desire to find and know what happened to the ones that they loved. This documentary juggles with remembering of the past and forgetting it. The Pinochet Military dictatorship detained and killed thousands of Chileans and later tried to conceal this act by erasing any evidence of its occurrence. Many Chileans have now, much like the dictatorship did, forgotten or ignored the fact that such acts ever took place. But, even though the dictatorship tried to conceal their acts, people still continue to search for those that went missing. Women search zealously for the remains of those that they love so that they can gain some comfort and peace back in their lives. Patricio Guzm√°n's documentary compares two seemingly different ideas in a way that presents them to be the same endeavor. Guzm√°n stresses the struggle these Chilean women face as they try to find their loved one's bodies, and at the same time he points out how astronomers struggle to understand humanity's origin by looking at the cosmos. Both groups delve into the past in order to create a more solid and concrete understanding of it. The women who search the desert look for the calcium in the form of bones while the astronomers look for calcium as a remnant of stars and the big bang. Slides were shown of asteroids that then transitioned into close-ups of bone fragments. The difference is indistinguishable, and expresses, on a deeper level, that these astronomers and women are on the same journey. In the documentary, searching for origins inform life in the present. The film challenges Chile's national practice to forget what happened and its lack of accountability. A paradox presented by Guzm√°n is that Chile is a place where accessing the past is the easiest, yet the Chilean people are unable to acknowledge or reconcile with their own past. These women who try and understand the past are seen by many as merely a nuisance to society. People relate more with the astronomers than they do with Vicky and Violeta. Some Chileans have decided, instead of acknowledging and understanding their past, to put aside what happened and pretend like it never occurred. In the documentary, Guzm√°n referred to Miguel and his wife Anita as a metaphor for Chile: one tries to remember his past and origins while the other forgets. This idea becomes one of Guzm√°n's main points: they should not be forgetting, but instead remembering to learn more about their own origins. At the end of the film, Guzm√°n states that only those who understand their past are able to live in the present and look into the future. Those who do not are unable to; they do not exist because they have ‚Äúno beginning and no future.‚Äù Reception Nostalgia for the Light opened to wide acclaim from critics. It holds a 100% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, as well as a 91/100 average on Metacritic. Stephen Holden, writer for The New York Times, praised it as a ‚Äútransfixing cinematic essay.‚Äù He comments that the film is a narrative reflective about the importance of time and sends a political message about memory. Guzm√°n is said to express his longing for the Chile he grew up in, when the times were more peaceful. Nonetheless, his ‚Äúbelief in eternal memory is an astounding leap of faith.‚Äù Kenton Smith, from Uptown, reiterates a similar stance. He states that the archeologists and astronomers (archeologists being the historians of what's underneath the earth and astronomers being the archeologist of the cosmos) have the most in common as they both recreate the past. The documentary is praised for its stunning visuals and impressive views of the cosmos but despite the aesthetics, it evokes the idea that we, according to Smith, ‚Äúconcern ourselves with fleeting power and evil deeds, treating both as though they are more than mere smudges on a much larger blueprint.‚Äù Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times comments that the connections between the astronomers, archeologists, the Atacama, and the women who searched for their loved ones is the focus of the film. The relationship they all share, their goals, is all connected to the notion of returning to and remembering Chile's past. Amy Biancolli of the San Francisco Chronicle shares the notion that the documentary has stunning images. But she also recognizes the translucency that defines the present. She comments that there's only a succession of moments that slip into history before we have time to notice them,\\" and then comments on how characters like Miguel and Valentina both share their past through their memories. The documentary was well received by critics in Chile. Ascanio Cavallo, from the El Mercurio, praises the movie for being poetic and provocative. Crist√≥bal Fredes of the La Tercera comments that the film received great reviews from The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times. The parallels in his documentary, Guzm√°n said, were the most important part and the focus of the film. Guzm√°n purposefully made the story he told poetic. Zapatos Chinos claims Guzm√°n to be an important filmmaker in Latin America. His film is stated, again, to be poetic and contains beautiful images that ask to be looked at and interpreted. The film engages us to take a journey that brings us throughout space, not only the cosmos but also the earth beneath our feet.

Described as an \\"allegory about the curative powers of story,\\" the film centers on bibliophile Lessmore and his custodianship of a magical library of flying books. It was created using computer animation, miniatures and traditional hand-drawn techniques. After winning over a dozen film festivals, the film was awarded the Best Animated Short Film at the 84th Academy Awards.Watch \\"The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore\\", The Academy Award-Winning Best Animated Short Film - /FilmWinners of the 84th Academy AwardsOscar.go.com An official iPad app based on the film was also released in the Apple App Store. This however requires updating as it does not work with the current iOS. A book adaptation was released in late 2012. About Morris Lessmore sits on a balcony in the French Quarter of New Orleans writing a memoir. Suddenly a storm strikes, blowing Morris's writing out of his book and blowing him off the balcony. While Morris frantically grabs for his book, the storm blows away the buildings. After the storm, Morris finds the city and its residents devastated. He walks through the streets strewn with book pages and into the countryside. There he sees a woman fly past, magically suspended by flying books which she is holding with ribbons. She sends one of the books down to Morris. The book's pages flip back and forth to animate an illustration of Humpty Dumpty, who urges Morris to follow him. The flying book takes Morris to a library where other flying books live. Morris finds no humans there, but notices several portraits on the wall, one of which is the woman he had seen. In the story the books could talk to Morris. Morris then becomes the proprietor of the library. He takes care of the books, even saving the life of an early French edition of Jules Verne's From the Earth to the Moon after it suffers a catastrophic injury falling from a shelf. He also gives out books to those who visit the library from the city still suffering from the effects of the storm. Eventually Morris begins to rewrite his memoir, sharing passages with the flying books who gather around him on the grassy hill opposite the library. Years later Morris, now an old man, finally completes the book. Satisfied with his life's work, he closes the book and heads for the door. The flying books swirl about him and Morris becomes young again. He then flies away, carried by flying books like the woman earlier. As he departs, his book, which had earlier been an ordinary book, becomes a flying book like the others, and returns to the library. Just then, a young girl arrives. She sits down on the steps of the library and begins to read Morris's book as the flying books gather around. The final scene shows Morris's portrait added to the picture wall in the library. Inspiration Buster Keaton wearing a pork pie hat The book was inspired by William Morris, children's books publisher at HarperCollins and Joyce's mentor. Joyce wrote a story about a man who gives his life to books when he was on an airplane flight to visit Morris. Joyce read the story to Morris, who died a few days after that. Morris Lessmore was visually modeled after the silent film actor Buster Keaton. The film drew particular inspiration from the storm scene in Keaton's 1928 film Steamboat Bill, Jr. and the tornado from The Wizard of Oz (1939). Also an inspiration was the real-life Hurricane Katrina which devastated New Orleans in 2005. Like The Wizard of Oz, the film utilizes the contrast of color and black-and-white as a narrative device. In this case, the black-and-white represents the sadness and despair brought about by the storm. Reception Writer and co-director William Joyce holding the Academy Award won by the film in 2012 The film has received 14 awards, including the Audience Award at the Austin Film Festival, \\"Best Animated Short\\" at the Cinequest Film Festival and the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore Wins Animated Short Film: 2012 Oscars Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal congratulated Shreveport-based animation studio Moonbot Studios for winning an Oscar at the 84th Annual Academy Awards in Hollywood. \\"Louisiana celebrates this Oscar win with the exceptionally talented and creative staff of Moonbot Studios in Shreveport,\\" Jindal said. \\"We're proud that Louisiana residents and a Louisiana-based company created this groundbreaking work that pays homage to a love of books and perseverance through a love of learning.

It is added to a fracking fluid which may vary in composition depending on the type of fracturing used, and can be gel, foam or slickwater‚Äìbased. In addition, there may be unconventional fracking fluids. Fluids make tradeoffs in such material properties as viscosity, where more viscous fluids can carry more concentrated proppant; the energy or pressure demands to maintain a certain flux pump rate (flow velocity) that will conduct the proppant appropriately; pH, various rheological factors, among others. In addition, fluids may be used in low-volume well stimulation of high-permeability sandstone wells (20k to 80k gallons per well) to the high-volume operations such as shale gas and tight gas that use millions of gallons of water per well. Conventional wisdom has often vacillated about the relative superiority of gel, foam and slickwater fluids with respect to each other, which is in turn related to proppant choice. For example, Zuber, Kuskraa and Sawyer (1988) found that gel-based fluids seemed to achieve the best results for coalbed methane operations, but as of 2012, slickwater treatments are more popular. Other than proppant, slickwater fracturing fluids are mostly water, generally 99% or more by volume, but gel-based fluids can see polymers and surfactants comprising as much as 7 vol% , ignoring other additives. Other common additives include hydrochloric acid (low pH can etch certain rocks, dissolving limestone for instance), friction reducers, guar gum, biocides, emulsion breakers, emulsifiers, 2-butoxyethanol, and radioactive tracer isotopes. Proppants have greater permeability than small mesh proppants at low closure stresses, but will mechanically fail (i.e. get crushed) and produce very fine particulates (\\"fines\\") at high closure stresses such that smaller-mesh proppants overtake large-mesh proppants in permeability after a certain threshold stress. Though sand is a common proppant, untreated sand is prone to significant fines generation; fines generation is often measured in wt% of initial feed. A commercial newsletter from Momentive cites untreated sand fines production to be 23.9% compared with 8.2% for lightweight ceramic and 0.5% for their product. One way to maintain an ideal mesh size (i.e. permeability) while having sufficient strength is to choose proppants of sufficient strength; sand might be coated with resin,to form CRCS (Curable Resin Coated Sand) or PRCS (Pre-Cured Resin Coated Sands). In certain situations a different proppant material might be chosen altogether‚Äîpopular alternatives include ceramics and sintered bauxite. Proppant weight and strength Increased strength often comes at a cost of increased density, which in turn demands higher flow rates, viscosities or pressures during fracturing, which translates to increased fracturing costs, both environmentally and economically. Lightweight proppants conversely are designed toals can break the strength-density trend, or even afford greater gas permeability. Proppant geometry is also important; certain shapes or forms amplify stress on proppant particles making them especially vulnerable to crushing (a sharp discontinuity can classically allow infinite stresses in linear elastic materials). Proppant deposition and post-treatment behaviours Proppant mesh size also affects fracture length: proppants can be \\"bridged out\\" if the fracture width decreases to less than twice the size of the diameter of the proppant. As proppants are deposited in a fracture, proppants can resist further fluid flow or the flow of other proppants, inhibiting further growth of the fracture. In addition, closure stresses (once external fluid pressure is released) may cause proppants to reorganise or \\"squeeze out\\" proppants, even if no fines are generated, resulting in smaller effective width of the fracture and decreased permeability. Some companies try to cause weak bonding at rest between proppant particles in order to prevent such reorganisation. The modelling of fluid dynamics and rheology of fracturing fluid and its carried proppants is a subject of active research by the industry. Proppant costs Though good proppant choice positively impacts output rate and overall ultimate recovery of a well, commercial proppants are also constrained by cost. Transport costs from supplier to site form a significant component of the cost of proppants. Other components of fracturing fluids Other than proppant, slickwater fracturing fluids are mostly water, generally 99% or more by volume, but gel-based fluids can see polymers and surfactants comprising as much as 7 vol% , ignoring other additives. Other common additives include hydrochloric acid (low pH can etch certain rocks, dissolving limestone for instance), friction reducers, guar gum, biocides, emulsion breakers, emulsifiers, and 2-Butoxyethanol. Radioactive tracer isotopes are sometimes included in the hydrofracturing fluid to determine the injection profile and location of fractures created by hydraulic fracturing.Reis, John C. (1976).

In the US, except for diesel-based additive fracturing fluids, noted by the American Environmental Protection Agency to have a higher proportion of volatile organic compounds and carcinogenic BTEX, use of fracturing fluids in hydraulic fracturing operations was explicitly excluded from regulation under the American Clean Water Act in 2005, a legislative move that has since attracted controversy for being the product of special interests lobbying.

An anime television series based on the game aired on the TV Tokyo network from May 4, 2011. The series was produced by Level-5 in conjunction with TV Tokyo, Dentsu, and OLM. Plot =GO= Set 10 years after the first anime Inazuma Eleven, a new soccer system is implemented where the results of matches are predetermined even down to the point scoring. A boy called Matsukaze Tenma loves soccer. However, it is being controlled by Fifth Sector and he is highly against it. In the first episode, he wants to join the Raimon soccer club, but upon arrival, a mysterious team crushes the Raimon soccer club, including its second team. All the second team members leaves and Tenma is tested before he joins the team. Now with his new friends, he and Raimon go against the soccer being rigged by Fifth Sector and is determined to defend his soccer honor. =Chrono Stone= After Tenma returns from Okinawa from tutoring the local children about soccer, he returns to Raimon, only to discover that the soccer club has never existed. Alpha, a person who comes from El Dorado, an organization from the future hell-bent on destroying soccer, tries to erase Tenma's soccer memories. With the assistance of Fei Rune and Clark Wonderbot, both came from the future, Tenma and his friends must defeat El Dorado in order to return soccer to the world. =Galaxy= Football Frontier International Vision 2 (FFI V2) is being held, and all the best school soccer teams gathered in hope to gain a place in Shinsei Inazuma Japan, Japan's new national soccer team. But things are getting out of control when instead of skilled players, 8 soccer players who are new to soccer are selected, along with Tenma, Tsurugi and Shind≈ç. The team is deemed to be a failure by both audience and Shind≈ç himself, so what is happening? Will Shinsei Inazuma Japan be able to shine on the world stage, or is it too bad to even win a match? Later, as Shinsei Inazuma Japan advanced through the Asia premilinaries, a terrible truth unfolds‚ÄîFFIV2 is actually the premilinaries of District A of an interplanetary tournament: Grand Celesta Galaxy.

There is a correspondence between incidences of drink and crimes of violence, such as assaults and stabbings. Accordingly, there is a debate about the effect of voluntary intoxication on the mental element of crimes, which is often that the defendant foresaw the consequences, or that they intended them. In dealing with this issue and balancing theoretical problems with public policy issues, the English law has categorised offences into two categories, those of basic intent and those of specific intent. In the latter, the defendant's intoxication will be directly relevant as to whether he or she formed the necessary intent. In the former, the picture is more complicated and unclear, although it is known that intoxication will not provide a defence where recklessness can be shown on the accepted facts. Crimes of specific intent include murder, and those of basic intent most crimes of recklessness, including manslaughter. Basis There is a widely held belief that alcohol consumption fuels violence. The picture may be more complex involving other factors, including the effects of chronic alcohol abuse rather than its immediate effects. Neither voluntary nor involuntary intoxication provide a defence in English law in themselves. No behavior is excusable merely because it was committed whilst intoxicated, and the phrase \\"a drunken intent is still an intent\\" - used in Sheehan -has not been abandoned. Where an individual voluntarily intoxicates himself, it is not a defence for him to then claim he does not intend any actions he commits while intoxicated.Ormerod, p. 276 The Earl of Birkenhead stated in 1920 that until the early 19th century voluntary drunkenness was never a defence, based on the principle that \\"a man who by his own voluntary act debauches and destroys his will power shall be no better situated in regard to criminal acts than a sober man\\". This was considered the authority by Lord Elwyn-Jones in the Majewski case. Instead, intoxication may assist the defence arguing that the defendant lacked the appropriate mens rea (mental element) for the crime. However, it has been recognised at common law that those who would not intend to commit a crime if sober cannot be held to the same level of culpability as those who would. Thus, the approach of the courts is generally to find intoxicated individuals guilty of crimes which require basic intent, rather than the specific intent required for other crimes. Specific and basic intent In Majewski, Lord Elwyn-Jones, giving judgement, indicated that a crime was one of specific intent if the mens rea went further than the actus reus (prohibited acts, as they actually occurred); in other words, that the crime was one of ulterior intent. This makes sense in the case of burglary and of criminal damage with intent to endanger life, where the intent need not be carried out, and which have been judged crimes of specific intent. However, this fails to explain why murder is considered a crime of specific intent, despite the fact that its mental aspect, intent to cause grievous bodily harm or death, is equal or less than the actus reus requirement of causing death. Similarly, causing gross bodily harm with intent (contrary to section 18 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861) has a matching mens rea and yet is also considered a crime of specific intent. Lord Simon's judgement in the same case advanced a different definition: crimes of specific intent required a \\"purposive element\\". The court in Heard considered a specific intent one which fitted either possible definition. However, murder is again an exception: since Woolin, it can be committed not by intent but by virtual certainty and foresight of virtual certainty. Lord Elwyn-Jones also expressed that if a crime could be committed recklessly, it was one of basic intent. This is supported by a number of academics, who do however consider it a matter for the common law to establish by precedent. The distinction between crimes of specific and basic intent is demonstrated by the intoxication case of R v Lipman. Here, a man who had voluntarily taken LSD struck and asphyxiated a woman while hallucinating, believing her to be a snake. The man was found to lack the specific intent required of murder, but satisfied the basic intention of manslaughter, that of recklessness. While it has been argued that there is no consistent principle behind the distinction, there has been some judicial effort to suggest a means of categorisation. =Intoxication and specific intent= Case law has established that murder, wounding or causing grievous bodily harm with intent, theft, robbery, burglary with intent to steal, handling stolen goods, some forms of criminal damage, and any attempt to commit a crime of specific intent are themselves crimes of specific intent. Where the defendant is on trial for a crime of specific intent, his state of intoxication will be relevant to whether he formed the required intent. This may prevent the defendant from having the required mens rea. If the defendant's intoxication is so significant as to prevent any sort of intent, this can lead to acquittal. A reduction in the strength of the formed intent is insufficient. In coming to this conclusion, the court in Sheehan placed a new interpretation on the words of Lord Birkenhead in Beard, taking account of the decision in Woolmington. Lord Birkenhead's words had been that intoxication would be relevant where it prevented the defendant from beingcapable of forming the necessary intent. =Intoxication and basic intent= Manslaughter, rape, sexual assault, maliciously wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm, kidnapping and false imprisonment, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault have all been judged crimes of basic intent. Attempting a crime of basic intent may be a crime of basic intent, but this is unclear. The court in Majewski refers to intoxication as a defence. If this were the case, in crimes of basic intent where it does not provide a defence, the counsel for the defendant could not argue that the defendant did not have the required mens rea because of intoxication. Accordingly, the mens rea become irrelevant and the Crown need not show it, thereby aiding the prosecution considerably. The alternative is that the voluntary intoxication provides a \\"prior fault\\" which substitutes for the mens rea required. This would leave the prosecution the task of showing voluntary intoxication to the satisfaction of the jury and the avoidance of doubt. However, the taking of alcohol or drugs probably bears little similarity to the rest of the crime the defendant stands accused of it. It is removed in both its nature and possibly significantly in time. The alternative would be to require the prosecution to still show the required mens rea. The defendant's intoxication would be disregarded and the defendant's state of mind assessed as it was. It would, however, rapidly become a question of whether the defendant would have foreseen the consequences had he been sober. This would, however, necessarily require finding defendants such as Lipman guilty, even where he was unconscious. Neither possibility has been explored in the common law. Accordingly, it only possible to say that the defence cannot argue that intoxication provides a defence, where recklessness has been shown on the fact, in crimes of basic intent. It is possible that the prosecution would be allowed, in certain circumstances, to dispense with the original mens rea entirely and rely solely on the voluntary intoxication to provide the fault element. Different types of drugs The case law on voluntary intoxication, and the Majewski doctrine, has focussed on intoxication by alcohol. In Lipman this was extended to the illegal drug LSD, well known for its hallucinative effects. In respect of other drugs, courts have restricted the scope of the Majewski formulation: in Bailey, a diabetic's failure to eat as advised after taking a quantity of insulin was not considered voluntary intoxication; in Hardie, a taker of diazepam (Valium) was similarly excluded. They established a further test, in order to exclude these types of defendants from a voluntary intoxication rule with a non-applicable public policy basis. Based on a physiological distinction that did not exist in a medical sense, the court distinguished between alcohol and illegal drugs on one hand, and \\"therapeutic\\" or \\"merely soporific or sedative\\" drugs on the other. Therefore, the question is twofold: to find voluntary intoxication, the defendant must appreciate that taking the drug may lead to \\"aggressive, unpredictable and uncontrollable conduct\\" (Bailey), but only generally speaking - he need not foresee any particular crime occurring.

It was first discovered in 1999 on the East Pacific Rise at depth of , on the surface of the polychaete worm Alvinella pompejana. Nautilia profundicola lives symbiotically on the dorsal hairs of A. pompejana but they may also form biofilms and live independently on the walls of hydrothermal vents. The ability of N. profundicola to survive in an anaerobic environment rich in sulfur, H2 and CO2 of varying temperature makes it a useful organism to study, as these are the conditions that are theorized to have prevailed around the time of the earliest life on earth.  Morphology  Nautilia profundicola is a motile, rod-shaped bacterium, around 0.4 Œºm long and 0.3 Œºm wide. Like most epsilonproteobacteria, it has an unsheathed polar flagellum.  Physiology  Nautilia profundicola lives among the hydrothermal vents and can grow at temperatures of . It uses anaerobic respiration and is a chemolithoautotroph. Nautilia profundicola uses hydrogen or formate as an electron donor and sulfur an electron acceptor to produce hydrogen sulfide. Nautilia profundicola contains the protein reverse gyrase, which has been found amongst thermophilic bacteria, and which helps it survive the large temperature variation associated with its environment. Reverse gyrase is theorized to keep the genome stable and prevent damage by the extreme heat. Along with the ability to fix carbon and sulfur, analysis of the genome of Nautilia profundicola points to a novel pathway of nitrogen fixation.  Taxonomy  Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of Nautilia profundicola allowed it to be placed in the family Nautiliaceae of the order Nautiliales in the class Epsilonproteobacteria. Analysis of this gene demonstrated that this organism shared 97.8 percent of its DNA for this gene with the related bacterium Nautilia lithotrophica. Using DNA‚ÄìDNA hybridization, the total DNA-DNA relatedness of the two organisms was found to be 34.6 percent which, along with differences in phylogeny, allowed Nautilia profundicola to be classified as its own species.  Genomic information  The genome of Nautilia profundicola consists of one circular chromosome of 1.7 million base pairs, which is small compared to other free-living epsilonproteobacteria. There is relatively little evidence of the influence of horizontal gene transfer in the genome of Nautilia profundicola and this lack of external DNA is theorized to be a product of its own defense mechanisms or the lack of free DNA in the surrounding inhospitable environment.  Ecological function  Nautilia profundicola is a member of the Epsilonproteobacteria, which are dominant in the vent ecosystem and are likely to be key players in the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. Nautilia profundicola has been found to have a symbiotic relationship with Alvinella pompejana, in which the worm secretes edible mucus, possibly in exchange for the bacterium's heat-resistant enzymes. This has the potential to explain how Alvinella pompejana can survive with one part of its body in water in the vent and the rest of its body in water outside the vent.

The first episode was broadcast on 10 January 2012. It is broadcast on Tuesday evenings at 9pm and repeated on Wednesdays at 3:30pm. Mark Porter presents the programme. History BBC Radio 4 has broadcast health related programmes since its inception in 1967. Mark Porter joined the BBC in 1992 and has been contributing to Radio 4 since. He also presents Case Notes for the channel. In 2011, the Radio 4 controller, Gwyneth Williams commissioned a new nine part series as part of an overall increase in the BBC's coverage of science. Content The first programme discussed whether it really is better to take tablets for high blood pressure in the morning, as many people do - or whether it may be better to take them in the evening, as a recent Spanish study claimed. The second programme in the series, broadcast on 17 January 2012, asked whether memory really does decline with age. It also asked whether nicotine might actually protect against Alzheimer's disease, but was careful to state that it was NOT saying that smoking had any health benefits, clarifying very strongly how there is a difference between smoking and nicotine. The third programme, broadcast on 24 January 2012, discussed whether cough medicine is suitable for children. The speaker on the programme, Margaret McCarney, gave quite a negative review of cough medicine. The edition broadcast on 31 January referred to atrial fibrilation, and also discussed the drug warfarin. It finished by talking about the health risks of wearing high- heeled shoes. On 6 March, discussion of diabetes mellitus, and whether care for people aged 16‚Äì24 was as good for those of younger age groups, was a key part of the programme. This programme also discussed the use of Twitter in dissemination of medical knowledge, and in this part of the programme, stressed the importance of patient confidentiality. In a late stage of the programme, the skin condition Vitiligo was discussed, and fictions about this skin disorder - such as that the skin disorder vitiligo is contagious - were outlined. The programme broadcast on 13 and 14 March 2012 discussed whether exercise is good or bad for one's joints.

History = Adelphi Theatre = The theatre was opened on 5 May 1911 as the Adelphi Theatre with George Marlow's production of The Bad Girl of the Family. The auditorium was licensed to seat 2,400 patrons and was a pioneer of modern cantilever structural techniques. It was the first theatre to have its tiers and galleries constructed on the cantilever principle superseding iron columns to support the front of each tier. The theatre was closed for renovations by Marlow's partner and entrepreneur Benjamin Fuller in October 1915. The auditorium was redesigned by Henry Eli White to improve sight lines thus reducing capacity to 2100. = Grand Opera House = Ivy Moore in Cinderella at the Grand Opera House, December 1919 (New Tivoli Theatre) In August 1916 the renovated theatre reopened and was renamed by Benjamin Fuller the \\"Grand Opera House\\". From 1929 it became the major outlet in Sydney for variety theatre, featuring vaudeville acts. Christmas pantomimes were popular and featured the in demand double act \\"Stiffy and Mo\\" (Nat Phillips and Roy Rene). = New Tivoli Theatre = In 1932 two vaudeville performers Mike Connors and wife Queenie Paul took over the lease of the theatre with their company, Con Paul Theatres, and renamed it the New Tivoli Theatre. The new name was in recognition of Harry Rickards's Tivoli Theatre at 79-83 Castlereigh Street (formerly the Garrick Theatre, Sydney). This period saw the emergence of well known Australian entertainers including Roy Rene and George Wallace. The theatre became famous for its chorus girls, known as \\"Tivoli tappers. Tivoli Circuit Australasia Pty Ltd emerged as the controlling organisation from late 1935 a period that saw an increase in imported acts. A high point was the visiting Old Vic Company in 1948 when Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh performed there. However restrictions in the war years led to a return of local artists and emerging stars featuring such names as Peggy Mortimer, Dick Bentley and Joy and George Nichols. George and Joy Nichols, Impersonators (Tivoli Theatre shows and artists) The New Tivoli declined after the arrival of television in Australia in 1956, and the last show was staged in 1966 with the revue One Dam' Thing After Another, starring Gwen Plumb. In 1969 the theatre was demolished. Its site is now occupied by Central Square, a tower of offices between Hay Street and Campbell Street.

The Final Rule replaced a variety of local and regional protocol with a unified policy for the first time. It also increased Department of Health and Human Services' control of organ donation. The Final Rule was issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and dictates the process to be taken by organ procurement organizations in conjunction with United Network for Organ Sharing to match donors with potential recipients. The Final Rule dramatically changed the way organ donations were allocated in the United States, moving away from a system that favored geographic areas with large donor banks towards a system that prioritized a patient's need for organ transplant over their proximity to the donor. This move reflects increased ability to successfully preserve and transfer organs for organ transplantation farther than was previously possible. This move was controversial among areas with larger donor banks because there were concerns that the rule would disincentivize organ donation. Donor banks believed donors would be less likely to donate if the organs were being transferred out of state.Grantham D. Transforming transplantation: the effect of the health and human services final rule on the organ allocation system. 35 U.S.F. L. Rev. 2001; 751: 752. Originally proposed in 1998, the Final Rule was not implemented until March 2000. Implementation was delayed in order to collect public input and due to lawsuits including two brought by the State of Wisconsin and State of New Jersey seeking injunctive relief from the ruling. The Final Rule as it stands today allows for local recipients to be considered first but directs organ procurement organizations to offer organs nationally if a local match cannot be made, taking urgency of need into account. The current ruling also gives Department of Health and Human Services veto power over any policies created by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, administered by the United Network for Organ Sharing, increasing the direct role of the federal government in organ donation.National Organ Allocation Policy: The Final Rule: Virtual Mentor: American Medical Association Journal of Ethics: http://virtualmentor.ama- assn.org/2005/09/hlaw1-0509.html References Category:Organ donation Category:2000 in American law Category:Health law in the United States ","title":"The Final Rule"},{"id":"34494357","text":"Rodica CiorƒÉnicƒÉ-Gavrili≈£ƒÉ (born March 25, 1976) is a journalist and editor from Moldova.

Formed in 1998, they are best known for their stand-up acts and TV tarento activities in variety shows. The duo was selected as one of the four finalists among 1,515 professional comedy groups in a televised competition called THE MANZAI 2011, broadcast by Fuji Television on December 17, 2011.  Biography  Ueda and Iwasaki first met while they were students at Kawaguchi Seiryo High School in Saitama prefecture. After graduation, they formed a musical band with two other members. Two years later, following the break-up of the band, Ueda and Iwasaki joined the entertainment company Yoshimoto Kogyo in 1993. In a Yoshimoto event called \\"Risutora event\\" (restructuring event), however, the duo was selected as a group that would let go from Yoshimoto due to incompetent performance, after only two years since they joined. Although the company management told them they could come back after a while, Ueda and Iwasaki lost confidence and motivation and left Yoshimoto, and gave up their careers as comedians. They made a living as truck drivers and gamblers at pachinko slot games. In the meantime, they restarted their activities as a band man. Ueda and Iwasaki played the bass and drums respectively in a band that was initially called \\"Zari Killer\\" and performed punk rocks. Later, the band renamed itself \\"Gum gum 3 channel\\" and performed a pop music inspired by Mr. Children (a Japanese popular pop band). After three years of this stint, they passed a comedian audition held at K Dash Stage, Ueda and Iwasaki came back to the career as a comedian in 1998. However, they had not succeeded in raising their profile in the show biz world for 13 years until they earned the finalist position in the manzai competition mentioned above. Soon after this event, Hi-Hi gained more than 100 offers from a variety of media including +50 offers from TV programs.  Performance  Ueda has made all their manzai dialogues. In manzai, Ueda is characterized as a sloppy, fickle and silly one while Iwasaki as a reasonable one. Their performance usually starts with Ueda's hail \\"Domo-ne! Waratte-ne! Kii-tsukatte-ne! Saikin Doh?\\" (Hi guys! Please laugh! Please be nice to us! How are you guys!?) followed by his totally meaningless line such as \\"Do you twirl pasta lately?\\", \\"Do you zip lately?\\", \\"Do you close curtains lately?\\", etc. Then, usually Iwasaki warns him \\"Too friendly (to the audience)! What are you saying...\\" and moved on to a main dialogue, saying \\"Listen, I am thinking I would like to...(i.e. travel abroad, buy a pet, ride a motorcycle, etc.).\\" Ueda does not respond properly, acts as if dropping things that has just popped up in his mind, and keeps shooting silly comments. In the end, Iwasaki closes their dialogue saying \\"Mo i-ya!\\" (Enough!).

Daizan Roshi is the founder of the Zenways Sangha and resident teacher at Yugagyo Dojo (Zen Yoga Camberwell) in London, United Kingdom.  Biography  Skinner was born in Chatham, UK in 1963 and grew up in Kent. After graduation, he worked as a scientist in the pharmaceuticals industry. He began studying S≈çt≈ç Zen under Rev. Master Daishin Morgan at Throssel Hole Buddhist Abbey in Northumberland in northern England. Given permission to enter full-time monastic training as a postulant in 1989, he was ordained as an unsui or novice monk on 4 April 1991.Journal of Throssel Hole Priory Vol. 18,2, summer 1991 p24 Reflecting on his time at the monastery, Daizan wrote, \\"For fourteen formative years I studied with him [Daishan Morgan], before continuing elsewhere with Rinzai Zen\\". Within Zen monastic society, the hierarchy is all-pervading and rigid. For the first seven years he lived in the zendo, the meditation hall, with three by six feet of space on the meditation platform and two cupboards, one for bedding and one for robes. Daizan R≈çshi reflects: \\"As junior monks, we were almost never alone. Every action 24 hours a day was expected to be obedient to instructions, undertaken mindfully and with consideration for others. The monastery is a pressured environment. The image used to exemplify it was the rock tumbler; the months and years of living cheek by jowl gradually smooth off all the rough corners so that each monk becomes a polished jewel.‚ÄùThe Middle Way Vol 85, No 3 November 2010 p182 He received dharma transmission on 21 December 1995.Journal of Throssel Hole Priory Winter 1995, vol 22, 4, p.39 In 2003, Daizan began training with Rinzai Zen Master Shinzan Miyamae R≈çshi of Gyokuryuji Temple in Gifu, central Japan.http://calligraphyzen.com/ The temple was the former hermitage of the outstanding Rinzai Zen reformer Bankei Y≈çtaku Zenji (1622‚Äì1693). Shinzan R≈çshi, something of a maverick in the modern Zen world, intended the tiny temple to provide a basis of true Zen training outside the Rinzai mainstream which has become increasingly focused on providing high-price funerals. Daizan eventually became fukujushoku, vice-abbott, continued his study of zazen and zen yoga and studied the k≈çan curriculum of the Mino branch of the Inzan lineage of Rinzai Zen, completing it in 2007. On 8 May 2007 Daizan received inka from Shinzan R≈çshi. He returned to the UK to begin teaching Zen. On midsummer morning (21 June) 2007 Daizan R≈çshi began a walk from the south tip of the Isle of Wight to the northern tip of Scotland.Oxfordshire Courier Thursday 5 July 2007 Wearing his monastic robes and kasa (hat) and carrying no money, Daizan R≈çshi walked up the centre of the island of Britain finishing on Cape Wrath at the north of Scotland. The 777-mile walk took 64 days.The Middle Way Vol 84 no 1 May 2009 p19 On 28 May 2011, he was installed as resident teacher at Yugagyo Dojo (Zen Yoga Camberwell) in London. The event was presided over by Shinzan R≈çshi. He has served as a resident teacher at the Buddhist Society in Londonhttp://www.thebuddhistsociety.org/groups/Living%20the%20Dharma.html and is an appointed trainer with the College of Mindful Clinicians. He has been involved in Zen teaching at Oxford University and is particularly involved in the \\"Managing Your Mind\\" programme of postdoctoral study. In March 2015 Daizan R≈çshi, together with co-translator Sumiko Hayashi, published the book \\"In Heaven's River: Poems and Carvings of Mountain-Monk Enku\\", a tribute to the life and art of Enk≈´, the 17th century Japanese itinerant wonder-working mountain monk, sculptor, and poet. In July 2015, he published the book \\"The Zen Character: Life, Art and Teachings of Zen Master Shinzan Miyamae\\" to coincide with Shinzan R≈çshi's 80th birthday and an exhibition of his calligraphy in London.

Chalmers captained the Rhodesian team during its unsuccessful attempt to qualify for the 1970 FIFA World Cup, and was its leading goalscorer. In a profile published in 1980, Chalmers was described by journalist Glen Byrom as a \\"perfect gentleman and sportsman ... Southern Africa's crown prince of soccer\\". Growing up in a sporting family in Bulawayo, Chalmers showed promise in rugby and cricket as well as football. While still an amateur, he played three times for Rhodesia in 1961, in friendly matches against touring English clubs. The following year he moved with his new wife to Durban, South Africa, where he signed for Durban City as a professional. After two years playing on the wing, he became City's centre- forward during the 1964 season and was a great success, scoring 58 goals in all competitions that season and helping his team to win that year's Castle Cup, uniquely scoring a hat-trick in the final. He also performed strongly for a league all-star team in an exhibition game against Real Madrid in September 1964, scoring twice and afterwards receiving praise from visiting defender Jos√© Santamar√≠a, a Uruguay international. In 1966, he was transferred from City to their cross-town rivals, Durban United, for what was then a South African record fee of R20,000. After two successful years with United, he moved again to Maritzburg, where he remained for the rest of his career. In 1969, he was recalled by Rhodesia to captain the national side in its bid to qualify for the World Cup for the first time. As a white man in a mostly black team, he was aided in this task by his fluent proficiency in both Sindebele and Shona. Rhodesia were pitted against a strongly fancied Australian team, but held their opponents to a draw in two successive matches before losing a play-off decider 3‚Äì1. Chalmers retired from playing in 1974, forced out of professional soccer by a knee injury, and became a public relations officer for a Durban hotel chain. Early life and amateur soccer Bulawayo in 1976 Bobby Chalmers was born on 19 February 1941 in Southern Rhodesia's second city of Bulawayo, where he attended Raylton Junior School and Milton High School. He grew up in a sporting family, and was inspired by his eldest brother Des, who represented Rhodesia internationally at both rugby union and boxing. Bobby also showed promise at rugby, playing at full-back for the First XV at Milton, and once appeared as the Rhodesia cricket team's twelfth man in a first-class inter-provincial match. However, he proved a more keen soccer player, and honed his skills as an amateur in the youth teams at Queens Sports Club, usually playing as a winger. In May 1961, Bulawayo was visited by two English soccer clubs, West Ham United and Leicester City, who were each touring South Africa and Rhodesia. Both took on the Rhodesia national team at Queens Sports Club, with West Ham doing so twice; Chalmers appeared in all three unofficial friendly matches. Rhodesia lost to West Ham twice, by scores of 3‚Äì0 and 5‚Äì0, and played against Leicester on 24 May, just 18 days after the tourists had lost that year's FA Cup Final 2‚Äì0 to English League champions Tottenham Hotspur. Leicester beat Rhodesia 4‚Äì3. Professional soccer career =Durban City= In early 1962, Chalmers moved with his new wife Audrey to the South African beach city of Durban, where he gained a trial with Durban City of the all-white National Football League (SANFL), the first professional soccer league in South Africa. He impressed the coaches and signed on as a professional in April 1962. Based at their New Kingsmead ground, Durban City had been formed in May 1959, two months before the SANFL; by 1962, they were one of the country's top teams, having won two of the first three national titles., , A key player for the club during its early days was Les Salton, a South African forward who was the SANFL's top goalscorer in each of its first three seasons, netting 117 goals in all competitions, including eight in one game against Johannesburg City in 1961. Chalmers joined just after Salton's sale to local rivals Durban United. Chalmers initially played as a winger, and scored 20 goals during his first professional season‚Äî15 in the league, and five more in cup competitions‚Äîas his club finished third in the league, one point behind Highlands Park and Southern Suburbs, another club from Johannesburg. In the Castle Cup, Chalmers received his first winner's medal as part of the Durban City team which beat Johannesburg Ramblers 2‚Äì1 in the final at Rand Stadium on 20 October 1962. He started the following season on the wing, but was fielded as a centre forward for the first time in June 1963, when his club took on Kimberley United in a Castle Cup first-round tie. The experiment proved a success, with Chalmers scoring seven in Durban City's 14‚Äì1 victory, latterly described by South African Soccer Weekly as a \\"massacre\\". The following week, when he was retained as the team's front man for the home game against West Rand United, he scored a hat-trick. He scored four more hat- tricks during the 1963 season, and finished the year with 26 league goals and nine more in other competitions. Durban City once more finished third in the table. During early 1964, Chalmers prepared thoroughly for the new season, seeking to broaden his style of play and remove some of the perceived technical weaknesses which observers thought had previously let him down; for example, before this time his heading skill had been seen as sub-par, and his passing skill had been little more than ordinary. When the season started, however, it quickly became evident to reporters that his hard work had paid off. In what is generally considered one of his strongest years as a professional, Chalmers progressed significantly during 1964, showing marked improvement in his heading, passing and shooting in particular. According to Byrom, Chalmers was during this period the best player in South Africa, \\"by far\\". Alf Boyd, Durban City's Scottish manager, made Chalmers the team's permanent centre-forward seven games into the 1964 season. Chalmers appeared in two friendly matches against touring teams during this year. First a combined team representing Natal Province lost 8‚Äì2 to English side Arsenal, then on 8 September 1964 Real Madrid took on a National Football League all- star team, dubbed the \\"Castle Knights\\", in front of 35,000 spectators at Rand Stadium. Byrom says the match was very exciting; \\"a wonderful soccer spectacle\\". At half time the score was 3‚Äì0 to the visitors, but just after the interval Chalmers pulled one back, beating Uruguay international Jos√© Santamar√≠a and another Madrid defender before slamming it into the away net. Santamaria reportedly stood stunned with his hands on his hips, not believing what had happened. Jolted back to attention, the Spanish side rallied and scored twice more before Chalmers scored another \\"brilliant\\" goal to make the score 5‚Äì2. Although he had finished on the losing side, Chalmers had acquitted himself well‚Äîthe match is often cited as one of his best games. He was praised afterwards by Santamaria, who had been impressed by his speed and footballing instinct. Chalmers became one of the league's top forwards, in one match scoring three goals in four minutes against Arcadia Shepherds. In the Castle Cup, his goalscoring exploits consistently helped Durban City to progress. In the quarter-final, he scored what Byrom considers one of the best goals of his career, in a home match against rivals Durban United. United, with Salton leading their front line, scored twice in the first 13 minutes before City closed the gap to 2‚Äì1 a minute before the break. Early in the second half, Chalmers collected the ball near the edge of the penalty area and sprinted with it along the 18-yard line, prevented from moving forward by three pursuant United defenders. Chalmers then stopped abruptly and, as his opponents were caught off balance, fired a low shot past them into the net. City went on to win the match and eventually reach that year's final, against Jewish Guild at Rand Stadium on 10 October 1964. In front of 25,819 fans, the two teams were level at 1‚Äì1 before Chalmers scored a hat-trick during the second half to give his side a 4‚Äì1 victory. It was the Rhodesian's second cup medal, and the only time a hat-trick was scored in a Castle Cup final. Also scoring freely in the league, Chalmers finished the season with 58 goals in all competitions (two short of Salton's South African record, set in 1960), with 39 of them coming in the league's 32 games. Durban City finished as league runners-up, three points behind Highlands Park, and reached the final of the Life Bowl, where they lost 2‚Äì1 to Durban United. The derby match, played at New Kingsmead, attracted 28,881 spectators, over 8,000 more than the previous year's final (in Johannesburg). At the end of the season, Chalmers was named South African Footballer of the Year. In May 1965, soon into the new South African season, the Rhodesian Football Association's application for full membership in global soccer federation FIFA was approved, making it eligible to enter competitive international tournaments such as the World Cup for the first time (starting in 1970, as it was too late to enter qualifying for the 1966 tournament). Chalmers scored 38 goals for Durban City during the 1965 season, including 22 in the league, as the club finished third, 11 points behind first-placed Highlands Park. In the Life Bowl, City reached the final, which was played against Cape Town City at Cape Town's Hartleyvale Stadium. Chalmers scored two of his team's goals as Durban City finished 3‚Äì1 victors to win the cup for the second time. After Chalmers scored six goals for Durban City during the early part of the 1966 season, the club sold him to Durban United for a South African record fee of R20,000. Although this record was later surpassed by transfer fees paid for South African-based players by foreign clubs, it remained the most expensive purchase by a South African club when the SANFL was dissolved in 1977. Chalmers' final goalscoring tally for Durban City in all competitions was a club record 157‚Äî40 more than Salton. =Durban United= Chalmers continued to perform strongly in the colours of Durban United, scoring a further 36 goals (25 in the league) before the year was out, giving him a total of 42 for the 1966 season. United finished the league season in third place, while without Chalmers their rivals City dropped to eighth. In the Life Bowl, United reached the final, where Chalmers scored his team's goal in their 3‚Äì1 defeat to Johannesburg Rangers at Rand Stadium. In 1967, Chalmers scored 24 league goals and 12 in other competitions as United finished fifth in the league, equal on points with Durban City. In one game during this year, against East London City, he scored eight in his team's 13‚Äì0 victory. The next season, Durban United finished as league runners-up, four points behind Highlands Park. Chalmers' contribution to the team this year was vastly reduced by a long-term injury; he appeared only six times for United during 1968, and scored only once. =Maritzburg= Just before the end of the 1968 season, United sold Chalmers to newly promoted Maritzburg, for whom he appeared three times that year without scoring. Maritzburg ended their first year in the top flight in eighth place. During his first full year with the club, 1969, Chalmers scored 12 league goals as Maritzburg finished the season in fifth place. He also played a key role for the club in both cup competitions that year, scoring a combined total of six goals, including the extra-time winner in the Castle Cup final against Cape Town City. In that year's Life Bowl, Maritzburg reached the final, but lost 5‚Äì1 to Highlands Park. At the end of the 1969 season, Chalmers was called up by the Rhodesia national team. Captain of Rhodesia, 1969 =Rhodesia enters the World Cup= Having become full members of FIFA in May 1965, the Rhodesia national team was eligible to enter the World Cup, but its entry into the qualifying rounds of the 1970 edition, the finals of which would take place in Mexico, caused a significant headache to the tournament's organisers. The political situation regarding Rhodesia, whose mostly white government had declared of independence from Britain in 1965, caused most countries not to accept Rhodesian passports, complicating overseas travel. Participation in international competitions became very difficult as many governments used the international sanctions on Rhodesia as grounds to refuse visas to the country's athletes, despite the fact that Rhodesian sports teams were racially integrated, unlike those of South Africa. As the Rhodesian Football Association had been expelled from the Confederation of African Football for political reasons, FIFA announced in December 1968 that Rhodesia would be placed in World Cup qualifying Group 15A, an Asian‚ÄìOceanian section which would see them play against Australia, Japan and South Korea, in an elimination mini-tournament held in the South Korean capital Seoul in October 1969. A month before the tournament was due to start, the South Korean government abruptly refused to grant visas to the Rhodesian players, citing the country's political situation. This prompted a series of tortuous negotiations between the various football associations and FIFA, which was keen to ensure Rhodesia could still play. Under the compromise ultimately agreed upon, the mini-tournament would go ahead without Rhodesia, and the winner from Seoul would then play Rhodesia over two legs in an as yet undecided \\"neutral\\" country. Australia protested that Rhodesia received an unfair advantage in playing fewer matches, but grudgingly went along with this. Australia won the initial qualifying series, while in Group 15B Israel defeated New Zealand over two legs. The winner of the second round matches between Australia and Rhodesia, played in Mozambique, would therefore play Israel for a place in the World Cup finals. =Australia vs Rhodesia= The Rhodesian team, headed by Scottish manager Danny McLennan, was out of practice, having not played since 1967. A four-game friendly series against Malawi was organised for February 1969, with two games each at home and away. Rhodesia drew 2‚Äì2 and won 1‚Äì0 in Malawi on 1 and 2 February respectively, then won 4‚Äì0 and drew 1‚Äì1 at Gwanzura Stadium in Salisbury a week later. Chalmers scored once in the third match. After breaking up for the domestic season soon after, the national side reconvened to begin training for the World Cup qualifying tournament in August 1969, while the South African league season was still going on. The 22-man squad chosen was made up of 13 blacks, seven whites and two coloured (mixed-race) players; according to the Melbourne Age, Rhodesia's key players were Chalmers, Hylton Grainger (another forward, who played for Johannesburg Rangers) and Robin Jordan, who had been the country's first-choice goalkeeper since 1962. The side also included George Shaya, who had just won the inaugural Rhodesian Soccer Star of the Year award for his strong performances up front for Salisbury Dynamos. Because of their professional commitments in South Africa, Chalmers and Grainger remained with their clubs until later. During late 1969, the Rhodesian team played seven practice matches against local clubs and provincial XIs, and finished the series unbeaten. Chalmers and Grainger joined the squad for the last two warm- up games. Because of his proficiency in the Sindebele and Shona languages, as well as his experience in South Africa and unmatched reputation amongst the Rhodesian players, Chalmers was made the team's captain. With each side desperate to progress to the play-off against Israel, the Australian and Rhodesian soccer associations were at loggerheads long before the action began on the field. Chalmers personally became the target of protests from Sydney before the teams even travelled to Mozambique, with Australian officials positing that he should not be eligible for Rhodesia, as he was a permanent expatriate in South Africa. FIFA ruled that as a Rhodesian citizen who had never played for South Africa, there was no reason why Chalmers could not play. Four uninvited Rhodesian soccer officials surreptitiously observed the Australians' first practice session in Mozambique on 18 November. The teams were allowed two training sessions each at the match venue, the newly built 40,000-capacity Est√°dio Salazar, and during their exercises the Rhodesian squad were soon revealed to be well-drilled, with the Sydney Morning Herald reporter commenting on the high standard of their fitness, athleticism and ball skills, as well as the influence of Chalmers, who he wrote was ably fulfilling his duties as captain: \\"Chalmers ... their danger man, was all over the pitch cajoling his team to pull out that little bit extra.\\" Observers still considered Australia to be favourites, but Rhodesia's strong form in training, combined with injury problems amongst the Australians, shortened the odds on a Rhodesian victory. As the first leg of the tie approached, supporters travelled from Rhodesia and South Africa to attend. A special train carried fans from Bulawayo, while three chartered flights came from the capital Salisbury. The first leg of the tie, played in torrential rain before about 6,500 spectators on 23 November 1969, was reportedly an uncultured affair, with the slippery playing conditions affecting both teams' passing and coordinated movement. The Australian team reportedly underperformed significantly, with their forward line struggling to work together against the Rhodesians, who were reported to be technically outclassed, but apparently far more motivated than the Australians, defending doggedly. Exceptional goalkeeping by the Rhodesian goalkeeper Jordan frustrated Australia for much of the game, and earned him glowing praise from reporters representing the Sydney and Melbourne presses. The score remained level until early in the second half, when Chalmers collected a loose ball and shot it past Ron Corry in the Australian goal to make the score 1‚Äì0 to Rhodesia. Tommy McColl scored Australia's only goal soon after, and the match ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw. Angry at their own poor performance, the Australian players declared Rhodesia to be the worst team they had ever played in a World Cup match, and promised the Australian press a 6‚Äì0 victory in the second leg.; ; Four days later, in the second leg, the Rhodesian underdogs once again frustrated Australia, holding them to a 0‚Äì0 draw. A play-off was therefore organised for 29 November; if this tie-breaker still failed to produce a winner, the match would be decided by ballot. The Sydney Morning Herald reporter expected the play-off, attended by less than 3,000, to head the same way as the sides' two previous meetings, but was surprised to see Australia finally find their groove, \\"spraying pin- point passes all over the field, making Rhodesia look flat-footed by comparison\\". The Australians took the lead on 12 minutes through a goal from Willie Rutherford, who also contributed to his team's second ten minutes later: Rutherford crossed the ball into the opposing goal area from a free kick, and Rhodesian defender Phillimon Tigere inadvertently headed past Jordan to score an own goal. Jordan left the game after 37 minutes with a bloody wound to his head‚Äîthe result of a collision with Australia's Ray Baartz‚Äîand was replaced between the posts by Stewart Gilbert. After the score remained 2‚Äì0 at the interval, Rhodesia fought back during the early second half and halved the gap on 49 minutes, when midfielder Nelson Mapara took advantage of a mix-up amongst the Australian defence to set up Chalmers, who scored. Australia regained a two-goal cushion eight minutes later, however, when a hard shot from Johnny Warren, their captain, ricocheted off Rutherford, past the unsighted Gilbert and into the Rhodesian goal. The match ended 3‚Äì1, and Rhodesia were out of the World Cup. Australia coach John Barclay said afterwards that the Rhodesian team had performed well, and given his Australians an unexpectedly difficult time during the qualifying matches; McClennan agreed, and rued the injury in the last game to Jordan, which he said had unsettled his team. Australia lost to Israel 2‚Äì1 on aggregate in the final round. Style of play Chalmers is widely held to be one of the best soccer players ever from Rhodesia or Zimbabwe, as well as one of the finest forwards to have played in South Africa., , With his burly frame, sports historian Peter Raath postulates that Chalmers \\"could quite easily have been a Springbok rugby player\\". Byrom describes him as \\"soccer dynamite\\"; \\"a graceful stylist, with a supple swerve and cannon-ball shot\\". Playing as a forward, Chalmers was a strong all-round player, able to skilfully control the ball with both feet and with his head. While able to supply his team-mates with deft passes, he also boasted an exceptionally powerful shot, which while he was playing for Maritzburg was once put to the test with an electronic timer. Chalmers' shot, taken bare-footed, was timed at , just below the speed registered with boots on by Leeds United and Scotland winger Peter Lorimer in an English \\"hardest shot\\" competition. As the captain of Rhodesia in 1969, Chalmers was greatly assisted in his leadership of the mostly black team by his fluent knowledge of both Sindebele and Shona. In his 1980 profile of Chalmers, Byrom described him as \\"always the perfect gentleman and sportsman\\", and attested that he \\"deserved the accolade as Southern Africa's Crown Prince of Soccer\\".

Life  John Frederick was a son of Duke John II of Saxe-Weimar and his wife Dorothea Maria of Anhalt. His brothers were the Dukes John Ernest I \\"the Younger\\" of Saxe- Weimar, Frederick of Saxe-Weimar, William IV of Saxe-Weimar, Albert IV of Saxe-Eisenach, Ernest I of Saxe-Gotha and Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar. John Frederick enjoyed a comprehensive education from Chamberlain Kaspar von Teutleben and Councillor Friedrich Hortleder. He did not follow his brothers to University. He did, however, accompany his brother Albert IV of Saxe- Eisenach in 1619 on his Grand Tour through France and Switzerland. They were accompanied by Hofmeister Hans Bernd von Botzheim and Councillor Tobias Adami. John Frederick, like his brother Albert, was made a member of the Fruitbearing Society by Prince Louis I of Anhalt-K√∂then, before the start of their Grand Tour. Louis gave John Frederick the nickname (\\"the Inflamed\\") and the motto (\\"spoil and receive\\"). His emblem was \\"stubbles in the field, set on fire, half burned\\". He was member number 18. In 1622, John Frederick and his brother Bernhard fought in the Battle of Wimpfen on the side of Baden. Three years later, his brother John Ernest the Younger promoted him to Colonel. Later that year, a power struggle between the brothers escalated for political reasons. It ended when John Frederick was arrested. He was later released. However, in 1627 he attempted to join the army of Tilly. He was caught, and again imprisoned by his brothers. John Frederick was very interested in Alchemy all his life. On 16 October 1628, while still in prison, he confessed, in writing, to a pact with the devil. The next day, he was found dead in his cell. Speculations ranged from suicide to murder; neither was ever conclusively proven. A witch trial against him was never started.

Atkinson's theorem and Atkinson‚ÄìWilcox theorem are named after him. His Ph.D. advisor at Oxford was Edward Charles Titchmarsh. Early life and education The following synopsis is condensed (with permission) from Mingarelli's tribute to F. V. Atkinson: He attended St. Paul‚Äôs School in West Kensington from 1929-1934 (in the same place that educated the poet John Milton, Samuel Pepys, mathematicians J. E. Littlewood, FRS, and G.N. Watson FRS. The High Master of St. Paul‚Äôs once wrote of Atkinson: \\"Extremely promising: He should make a brilliant mathematician\\"! Atkinson attended The Queen's College, Oxford in 1934 with a scholarship. During his stay at Queen's, he was secretary of the Chinese Student Society, and a member of the Indian Student Society. Auto-didactic when it came to languages, he taught himself and became fluent in Latin, Ancient Greek, Urdu, German, Hungarian, and Russian with some proficiency in Spanish, Italian, and French. His dissertation at Oxford in 1939 established, among other such results, asymptotic formulae for the average value of the square of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line. His final Examining Board at Oxford University consisted of G.H. Hardy, J.E. Littlewood and E.C. Titchmarsh. Career His first academic appointment was at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1939-1940, followed by a commission (1940) in the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park. At this time he met Dusja Haas, later to become his wife. He then took a position as Lecturer in Christ Church, Oxford. From 1948-1955 he was Full Professor in Mathematics (Chair, and Dean of Arts) at University College, Ibadan, in Nigeria. He joined Canberra University College (now part of Australian National University) in 1955 as Head of its Department of Mathematics. He left for the University of Toronto, in Toronto, Canada, in 1960 where he was Professor until his retirement in 1982 and Professor Emeritus until his death in 2002. Honours His honors include: Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (1967), U. K. Science Research Council Visiting Fellow at the University of Dundee and at the University of Sussex (1970), British Council Lecturer to U. K. universities (1973), Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1975), Royal Society of Edinburgh's Makdougall-Brisbane Prize (1974-1976), 29th President of the Canadian Mathematical Society (1989-1991), and winner of an Alexander Von Humboldt Research Award (1992). Bibliography Atkinson was the author of 3 books (one of them posthumous with Angelo B. Mingarelli) and more than 130 papers. He is best remembered for his classic text \\"Discrete and Continuous Boundary Problems\\" (1964), and his seminal contributions to differential equations as outlined in the margin.

RNA interchanges with the BNSF Railway in New Albany, Mississippi. It primarily hauls lumber products and Oil-Dri. History The first rail link between New Albany and Ripley was chartered by Colonel William C. Falkner, great-grandfather of famous author William Faulkner, in 1871 as The Ripley Railroad. By 1874 the line had been expanded north to Middleton and four years later the name changed to Ship Island, Ripley & Kentucky Railroad. In 1889, the railroad was sold to the Gulf & Chicago Railroad in foreclosure. The northern division of the Gulf and Ship Island railroad was also purchased, expanding the line to Pontotoc, Mississippi. In 1903, the Mobile, Jackson & Kansas City Railroad started building north from Beaumont, Mississippi, and joined with the Gulf & Chicago. The two railroads merged in 1909 to form the New Orleans, Mobile & Chicago Railroad. In 1917 this railroad was reorganized into the Gulf, Mobile and Northern Railroad and later the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad (GM&O;) in 1940. During these years the famous GM&O; train The Rebel ran along this route. The connection to the Frisco Railway (modern day BNSF) in New Albany was an important conduit for traffic along this route with almost all northbound freight being diverted to the Frisco in New Albany. In 1972, the GM&O; merged with the Illinois Central Railroad to form Illinois Central Gulf (ICG). Under ICG, the tracks south of Houston were abandoned. In 1985, ICG sold off this route to the Gulf and Mississippi Railroad, the first regional railroad in the United States, who operated it until 1988 when it was sold to Midsouth Rail. In 1994, Kansas City Southern Railway (KCS) purchased Midsouth and assumed control of this line. In 1998, KCS sold the line to North American RailNet, Inc who named it the Mississippi Tennessee Railnet. In 2003, Mississippi Tennessee Railnet was sold to Ironhorse Resources, Inc., who changed the name to Mississippi Tennessee Railroad (MTNR). A significant amount of track was abandoned under MTNR's ownership. In 2004 MTNR filed to abandon of track from a point just south of New Albany down to Houston, citing low traffic volumes and expensive maintenance costs. In 2008, of track from Middleton to Falkner was abandoned. The remaining track south of New Albany was used for car storage until 2010, when it was also abandoned. In October 2011, a spur to an industrial park north of New Albany was removed during the expansion of Mississippi Highway 15. In 2011, MTNR received financial support from the towns of Ripley and New Albany to make improvements to the line and began replacing rail ties. RNA switching lumber in Ripley On November 10, 2011, Alabama and Florida Railway (a subsidiary of Pioneer Railcorp) filed a petition to acquire and operate the MTNR. The name of the railroad was changed to the Ripley and New Albany Railroad. Current operations and abandonments The RNA operates on weekdays. It interchanges with BNSF in downtown New Albany. The 43.2 miles of abandoned right-of-way between New Albany and Houston is now the Tanglefoot Trail, a paved bike trail.  Motive power  Former MTNR Locomotive Roster.

He was a young boy when his birthplace was attacked, and his first book, The Fall of the Aerie, published in English translation in 1935, is often cited by scholars and historians for its eyewitness details.Svajian, Stephen G. A Trip Through Historic Armenia, GreenHill Publishing Ltd., 1977 (Self Defense of Shabin Karahissar [sic] 456-463) He wrote ten books in his lifetime, as well as articles and essays for Armenian newspapers and magazines. Early years Aram Haigaz‚Äôs home town was situated at the foot of a mountain in the northeastern area of present day Turkey. In the summer of 1915 when the military forces of the enemy were near, in what became known as the Shabin- Karahisar uprising, the entire Armenian population of 5,000 set fire to their homes and fields and climbed up the mountain to the remains of an old Roman fort at its peak. They took food and animals with them and fought for almost one month, until forced by famine to surrender. Of the more than 5,000 who climbed to the fort, only a handful survived. Aram Haigaz‚Äôs brothers, his father and other relatives were among those killed. He and his mother were sent on deportation, a forced march leading to the Syrian desert.ARMENIANS ARE SENT TO PERISH IN DESERT; Turks Accused of Plan to Exterminate Whole Population - People of Karahissar Massacred, New York Times, August 18, 1915, page 5 Aram Haigaz survived by converting to Islam, which allowed him to live as a Muslim, with a Turkish master, until he escaped to freedom.Hovannisian, Richard G.

America After escaping to Istanbul in 1919, Aram Haigaz was reunited with an aunt; he spent some time in an orphanage run by American missionaries, and also attended the Getronagan High School, where literature was one of his subjects, taught by famous writer and literary critic Hagop Oshagan. Within two years, in 1921, he sailed for the United States. He worked as an apprentice photo-engraver at The Daily Mirror, a New York City newspaper, and studied English at night, reading extensively the great world and American classics, from Kipling and Balzac to Poe. In 1922 he started writing for Armenian publications and took a pen name because he feared the stigma of rejections. At age 22, Aram Chekenian became Aram Haigaz. His writing When he died at age 85, Aram Haigaz had published ten books that were read by Armenians in many countries. Except for the autobiographical accounts of his early years, much of his output was in the form of humorous short stories and vignettes of contemporary life in the United States.

Martin (born 1969) is an American artist working with paintings on acrylic and canvas mediums. A self-taught artist, he is known for his signature technique of painting in reverse, using acrylic paint on a clear sheet of acrylic. Martin modernizes the 14th century technique of \\"Verre √âglomis√©\\" to layer acrylic paint on the reverse side of his acrylic canvas in creating his original pieces. In 2006 Martin began working on his third medium, Metallic Prints. Martin has created twenty-two Metallic Print series, totaling two hundred and fifty-one photographs. Born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and raised in Orlando, Florida, Martin started his career in the financial retirement industry and quickly realized that his passion was art and creating art. Martin began painting in 1994 in Dallas, Texas where he worked and lived at his studio in Uptown. Over the years, as his career evolved, he has had five different studio/gallery locations in Dallas. Martin then partnered with another gallery owner in Los Angeles in opening The Martin Lozano Gallery. He opened Christopher Martin Gallery in Aspen, Colorado in November 2010. In 2016, Martin opened a third location in Santa Fe, New Mexico on the city's famed Canyon Road. Martin currently has his galleries in Dallas, Santa Fe and Aspen, along with ongoing exhibitions in galleries in Houston and San Francisco.

The class of models is \\"wide enough to include as special cases virtually all the non-diffusion models of applied probability.\\" The process is defined by three quantities: the flow, the jump rate, and the transition measure. The model was first introduced in a paper by Mark H. A. Davis in 1984. Examples Piecewise linear models such as Markov chains, continuous-time Markov chains, the M/G/1 queue, the GI/G/1 queue and the fluid queue can be encapsulated as PDMPs with simple differential equations. Applications PDMPs have been shown useful in ruin theory, queueing theory, for modelling biochemical processes such as subtilin production by the organism B. subtilis and DNA replication in eukaryotes for modelling earthquakes. Moreover, this class of processes has been shown to be appropriate for biophysical neuron models with stochastic ion channels. Properties L√∂pker and Palmowski have shown conditions under which a time reversed PDMP is a PDMP. General conditions are known for PDMPs to be stable.

This incident became the subject of negative media attention and political attacks on Romney in both the 2008 and the 2012 presidential elections. Road trip in 1983 In June 1983, the Romney family left their Belmont, Massachusetts home on their way to Romney's parents' cottage in Beach O'Pines, Ontario for an annual vacation along the shore of Lake Huron. Their dog, Seamus, rode in a carrier on the roof of the family's Chevrolet Caprice station wagon for the 12-hour trip. Romney had built a windshield for the carrier to make the ride more comfortable for the dog. During the trip, Seamus got diarrhea. Romney stopped at a gas station to wash the dog, the carrier and the car. With Seamus back in the carrier, the family continued on their way. Seamus the dog Seamus ( ), an Irish Setter, was an active, outgoing dog, and was the Romney family's first pet dog. It is generally reported that, a few years after his ride to Canada, Seamus was given to Mitt Romney's sister, Jane Romney Robinson of California, who said, \\"He kept ending up at the pound. They were worried about him getting hit crossing the street. We had more space, so he could roam more freely.\\" The dog's date of death is unknown, but Robinson stated that Seamus lived to a \\"ripe old age\\" on her farm in California. Family response When interviewed by Chris Wallace of Fox News, Romney stated that Seamus enjoyed being in the dog carrier, an \\"air-tight kennel\\", and that he was not aware of any violations of Massachusetts law; the state's animal cruelty laws prohibit anyone from carrying an animal \\"in or upon a vehicle, or otherwise, in an unnecessarily cruel or inhuman manner.\\" Ann Romney, Mitt Romney's wife, has stated that the news media exaggerated the severity of the incident, and compared traveling in the roof-top dog carrier to riding a motorcycle or riding in the bed of a pickup truck. During an April 2012 interview with ABC News, Diane Sawyer asked Mitt Romney about the Seamus story and if he would ever do it again. Romney replied, \\"He loves it, it's his favorite.\\", after which Sawyer stated, \\"You said it was the most wounding thing in the campaign so far\\", although it's ambiguous whether Romney agreed with this statement. During the same interview, Ann Romney stated that Seamus got diarrhea from eating turkey off the table before the trip and that the dog loved the crate. Romney stated that he loved his dog.* Other responses In 2007, it was reported that Ingrid Newkirk, president of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), criticized Romney about this incident. Responding to PETA, Romney said, \\"my dog likes fresh air\\". Newkirk has elaborated (speaking for herself rather than for PETA) that the Seamus incident irritates her because \\"there are far more serious issues to talk about\\" regarding mistreatment of animals. During the 2012 U.S. Republican presidential primaries, candidate Newt Gingrich aired an anti-Romney attack ad that featured the story. While appearing on the ABC show This Week, Republican candidate Rick Santorum stated, \\"As far as Seamus the dog ... the issues of character are important in this election. We need to look at all those issues and make a determination as to whether that's the kind of person [Romney] you want to be president of the United States.\\" Santorum's view was at odds with that of Bill Wasik, senior editor of Wired Magazine: \\"Yet looking back on the Seamus Romney story today, what is most striking is its forgettability, how indistinguishable it seems in retrospect from the idiots' parade of meaningless stories that came to define the [2008] campaign.\\" Journalists Mike Allen and Evan Thomas assert that Romney did nothing unusual: \\"Overlooked in the clucking over the incident is the fact that the dog was in a crate, probably little different from the dog kennels used to transport animals in the cold-storage compartments of airplanes. Romney had erected a barrier to shield the family pet from the wind. Romney, the family man heading to the lake, didn't seem heartless at the time. But politics is a heartless business.\\" Journalist Ruth Marcus of The Washington Post defended Mitt Romney's treatment of Seamus, stating, \\"Doesn't the fact that Romney chose to bring the dog on the family vacation, rather than dump him in a kennel back home, suggest that he's a dog lover, not a hater?\\" Neil Swidey, The Boston Globe journalist who wrote the initial article about Romney's 1983 road trip, stated, \\"[Seamus] always struck me as a valuable window into how Romney operates. In everything the guy does, he functions on logic, not emotion.\\" A Public Policy Polling (PPP) survey found that 74% of Democrats, 66% of Independents, and 63% of Republicans consider it inhumane to put a family dog in a kennel on the roof of a car. The poll did not mention the windshield. The poll also found that 35% of voters would be less likely to vote for Romney because of the Seamus incident, whereas 55% of voters said that it would not affect how they vote. As of September 2012, New York Times columnist Gail Collins had mentioned the Romneys' car trip more than 70 times. Responding to Democrats who emphasized the Seamus story, conservative bloggers such as Jim Treacher drew a comparison between the Seamus incident when Romney was a 36-year-old man, and Barack Obama sampling dog meat as a child in Indonesia, where it is a local delicacy, as mentioned in Obama's autobiography. While an Obama spokesman called it an attack on a small child, Obama himself has displayed a sense of humor about it.The White House Correspondents' Dinner saw Obama saying that Sarah Palin's stint guest hosting The Today Show reminded him of an old query: \\"What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? A pit bull is delicious.\\" At the 2012 White House Correspondent's Association dinner, Obama poked fun at Romney releasing an \\"advertisement\\" depicting Romney and Seamus.

The character debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 6 November 1991. Ben Hamilton played a young Damian in flashbacks in 1997. Casting Damian was Doran's first \\"big\\" television role. He told a writer from Inside Soap that he was given no time to prepare and he was attending school one day and the next filming for the show. His teachers attempted to convince him to stay at school instead, but he thought that the role too much of a \\"wonderful opportunity\\" to give up. He was also signed to a \\"long contract\\" with the show. In September 1994, Justine Cullen from Inside Soap announced that Doran had quit the show in order to pursue other projects. Doran told Cullen that \\"I'm to make horror movies\\". In September 1995, Jason Herbison from Inside Soap reported that Doran had reprised his role. He added that upon Damian's return he has \\"thrown off his clean cut image\\" by having his hair in dreadlocks. Character development Damian is the son of Irene Roberts (Jacqui Phillips) and the younger brother of Finlay (Tina Thomsen) and Nathan (David Dixon). In The Official Home and Away Annual John Kercher describes the Roberts children's backstory as their suffering Irene's continuous gambling and their alcoholic father, Murdoch (Tom Richards) walked out and left them \\"to fend for themselves\\". As Irene was \\"rarely around\\", Finlay decided to help bring Damian and Nathan up.Kercher 1993, p.16. Playing a character whose mother suffers from alcoholism was a challenge for Doran. He told Inside Soap's that he had never seen his own mother drunk. So Doran \\"absolutely no idea what it must be like to be in Damian's shoes\\". He did not find it easy imagining how Damian should react to Irene's behavior. In is \\"hard\\" for character and he is in a constant dilemma because \\"at the same time as being treated so badly by his mother, he really loves her\\". He finds himself stuck between \\"loving her and wanting to support her and protecting himself and his own life\\". Doran revealed that he and Phillips had built a good rapport while working on the storyline. He also praised her acting abilities because she would transform into Damian's \\"nightmare of a mother\\" during filming. In the Home and Away ‚Äì Official Collector‚Äôs Edition, Andrea Black detailed Damian's early development. In one of the Roberts siblings first storylines with their alcoholic mother, Irene falls down the stairs and claims that Damian and Finlay pushed her.Black 2009, p.22. Irene later wants Damian to leave with her, but Finlay manages to convince Damian to live his life in Summer Bay.Black 2009, p.27. Finlay's influence on Damian helped the \\"troubled\\" character \\"stay on the right track\\".Black 2009, p.29. In 1992, Richard Norton who plays Simon Fitzgerald was told that his character was being written out of the series. Norton told Josephine Monroe from Inside Soap that producers informed him that they were more interested in \\"pushing\\" Doran and Dieter Brummer (who plays Shane Parrish) to develop their characters instead of Simon. Black stated that Doran and Brummer \\"became teen idol pin-ups as soon as they arrived in Summer Bay\\".Black 2009, p.23. Damian developed a friendship with Shane, which an Inside Soap writer called \\"an unholy alliance\\". Damian went along with Shane's dubious scams and they often had scrapes with the law, but they always stuck up for each other. However, when Kelly Chan (Theresa Wong) enrolled at Summer Bay High both boys fell for her and things turned nasty. Brummer commented \\"There's certainly a lot of tension in the air.\\" Kelly became more interested in Shane, but when she learned that he had lied about his court appearances, she turned to Damian and they went on a date. The magazine writer revealed \\"But things turn sour for the teenagers after Damien lies about what they got up to on their first date! Like most boys, he tries to impress the lads with tales of kissing and midnight fumbles - which of course aren't true.\\" Kelly decided she was better off being single and Shane and Damian fell out with each other. Doran told a writer from Look-in that the longer Damian and Shane are friends then the more likely he is to get into trouble. he explained that this was due to Shane being a \\"crazy kid\\". Doran and Brummer were good friends too. The camera crew labelled them \\"the overtime boys\\" because they would mess up their lines so the crew would earn overtime from retakes. Doran hoped that Damian would become more of a \\"goody goody\\" character in order to have a relationship. He added that \\"Damian needs some romance in his life\\". Storylines Damian is brought to Summer Bay by his alcoholic mother Irene in order to use him to emotionally blackmail his sister Finlay, who ran away and is living with Michael (Dennis Coard) and Pippa Ross (Debra Lawrance), into going home. The plan backfires when Damian tells Finlay he is happy she has escaped Irene, convincing her to stay. A few months later, Damian contacts Finlay and reveals he has run away too. Finlay and her friend Sophie Simpson (Rebekah Elmaloglou) hide him in the bush while Irene searches the town for him but when Pippa learns the truth she says they have to inform Irene. However, when Irene attempts to take him home, Damian reveals that he is scared of being beaten by Irene, showing the bruise she gave him, and Pippa refuses to let him go with her. Irene attempts to take him back by force, then tries to blackmail him and Finlay by threatening to charge them with assault. She eventually accepts they are better off where they are and Finlay and Damian are officially fostered by Pippa and Michael. Damian quickly runs afoul of school bully Tug O'Neale (Tristan Bancks). Fin's friends Blake Dean (Les Hill) and Simon Fitzgerald attempt to help him out by threatening Tug and forcing him to let Damian beat him in a fight. However, when Damian begins using the victory to stop Tug picking on others, he ends up agreeing to a rematch and Fin admits the truth to Damian. Damian is reluctant to fight Tug again but after he goads Damian, Damian knocks him to the ground. Damian gains a friend in classmate Shane Parrish, who soon gets him into trouble by stealing headmaster Donald Fisher's (Norman Coburn) car. Damian attempts to impress Shane by putting red paint into Donald's golf bag and Michael and Pippa are shocked he'd acted alone. Damian balks, however, when Shane robs the surf club kiosk and threatens to say Damian was in it with him if he tells anyone. Damian is threatened by Adam Cameron (Mat Stevenson), who is being blamed for the robbery, and when he and Fin tell Adam the truth, Adam forces Shane to return the money anonymously. Damian helps Shane in his revenge campaign against Ryan Lee (Alistair McDougall), who has been having an affair with Lucinda Croft (Dee Smart), the fianc√© of Shane's brother Nick (Bruce Roberts). The pair's friendship is tested when they are both attracted to new student Kelly Chan. Shane steps aside but when Damian tries to kiss her Kelly make it clear she only sees him as a friend. Damian feels betrayed when Shane then starts dating Kelly and punches him in the Diner but they make up after Kelly leaves town. Damian supports Shane when Tug frames him for burglary and hides him when he escapes from juvenile detention until his name is cleared. He also befriends two other new arrivals in town, Sarah Thompson (Laura Vasquez) and Angel Brooks (Melissa George), and helps set the latter up with Shane. He and Fin are shocked when Irene (now played by Lynne McGranger) returns, having turned over a new leaf, and have difficulty trusting her. Damian learns that Laura Brennan (Kris McQuade), a reclusive woman living in the area, is a former professional runner and manages to convince her to train him, as well as helping her go into business with Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) selling organic vegetables. Damian is mortified when Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie), his foster sister, develops a crush on him and kisses him when he is asleep and even more so when Shane reveals the fact to the whole school. When Shane and Angel go through a rough patch, Damian realises he has feelings for her but Angel gently tells him she does not see him like that. She does agree to accompany him to a presentation as his date when he wins a writing award but has to pull out when Shane arranged a date for the same night, although Sarah attends in Angel's place. Damian begins taking French language lessons and finds himself attracted to his tutor Cathy (Joy Smithers), a married woman whose husband works away as a lorry driver. Shane encourages him and Damian is on the verge of telling her how he feels when her husband walks in. Angel and Sarah, who mistakenly believe Shane is having an affair with Cathy, inadvertently save his blushes by bursting into the house at that moment. After failing to revise the correct material for his exams, Damian steals Donald's exam papers. Shane, Angel and Tug are blamed for cheating until he admits the truth. Damian's brother Nathan is released from prison and arrives in Summer Bay. Nathan, who beat Damian when they were younger, claims to be a reformed character and Damian decides to give him a chance until he commits a robbery at the school. Damian keeps it a secret until he is forced to step in when Sarah is being threatened by Nathan, who is then arrested for his crimes. Damian leaves for University but returns to be the best man at Shane and Angel's wedding. He sleeps with Irene's lodger Selina Cook (Tempany Deckert) who becomes pregnant and feels unable to support her. He feels guilty when she miscarries and apologises. When Damian learns that his father Murdoch had harassed Selina, he tells Nathan; Murdoch is then murdered when Nathan sends his cellmate Brian \\"Dodge\\" Forbes (Kelly Dingwall) after him. Damian is left feeling somewhat lost and, after a talk with Selina, decides to become a priest. He last appears when he visits Angel to help her get over Shane's death. Reception A reporter from BIG! wrote that through playing Damian, Doran had become \\"one of the world's most popular soap stars\\" and gained many \\"girl fans\\" who \\"adored him\\". A columnist from Shout said that \\"poor old Damian\\" filled his on-screen time with a hobby of jogging but there was \\"no sign of a girlie\\". They said that the character needed a relationship storyline, adding \\"when will Matt Doran finally get to have a major on-screen smooch, that's what were asking\\". A writer from Inside Soap said that Damian was in for more \\"ridicule\\" when Shane sets him up on a blind date. They added that \\"naturally it‚Äôs a complete disaster, just like everything else Damian's life. And unfortunately for Damian things are never going to get better, because the sad fact is, he's just another soap wimp.\\" They also opined that the character \\"is always going to be a loser\\". While a fellow writer added that he lacked confidence, but Laura (Kris McQuade) did a \\"brilliant job\\" of boosting Damian's self-esteem and proved to be a \\"great mate\\". Kate Langbroek from The Age branded Damian as the show's \\"residential intellectual\\" and joked that he was also \\"smart enough to leave Summer Bay\\".

It features a cable-braced hang glider high-wing, weight-shift controls, a single-seat open cockpit, tricycle landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration. The aircraft is made from bolted-together aluminum tubing, with its double-surface Pulse 11 wing covered in Dacron sailcloth. Its span wing is supported by a single tube-type kingpost and uses an \\"A\\" frame control bar. The standard engine supplied by the factory was the Zenoah G-25, , single cylinder, two-stroke, air-cooled aircraft engine The SkyCycle was intended to be constructed by people who were already hang glider pilots and, in fact, the manufacturer is a large hang gliding school. By keeping the weight down to a minimum the designer envisioned that the builder could use his or her existing hang glider wing for the aircraft. The manufacturer also supplied the Pulse 11 wing for those builders who did not own a hang glider wing. In 2005 the complete aircraft sold for US$7995 with plans selling for US$75. A total of 225 examples had been completed and flown by February 2005. The aircraft could be quickly dismantled for ground transportation or storage.

It was serialized in the manga magazine Monthly Flowers from 2007 to 2012, and was published as ten tank≈çbon volumes (collected editions) by Shogakukan. The series follows Kaoru Nishimi, an introverted high school student who discovers jazz music through his friendship with his delinquent classmate Sentar≈ç Kawabuchi. The series has been adapted twice: as a television anime series in 2012, and as a live action film directed by Takahiro Miki in 2018. The anime adaptation is directed by Shinichir≈ç Watanabe, with music by Yoko Kanno; it is the third collaboration between Watanabe and Kanno, following Macross Plus (1994-1995) and Cowboy Bebop (1998). The series was produced by MAPPA and Tezuka Productions, and aired on Fuji TV's Noitamina programming block. In North America, the series was licensed by Sentai Filmworks and aired on the streaming service Crunchyroll, which simulcast the series during its original broadcast run. The anime adaption of Kids on the Slope was widely acclaimed, with praise given to its direction, narrative, and music. Critics explored Kids on the Slopes depiction of Catholicism in Japan, its themes of male friendship and subtextual homoeroticism, and its relation to Watanabe's broader canon of works in their analysis of the series. Multiple outlets listed Kids on the Slope as among the best anime of the 2010s. Synopsis Kaoru Nishimi is an intelligent, introverted first-year high school student from a wealthy family who moves cities frequently as a result of his father's career; consequently, he has never made lasting friendships. In the summer of 1966, he relocates from Yokosuka, Kanagawa to Sasebo, Nagasaki to live with his extended family. On his first day of school he encounters Sentar≈ç Kawabuchi, a delinquent student feared by his classmates. Sentar≈ç's love of jazz music inspires Kaoru to study the genre, and the two boys begin to develop a close friendship through jazz sessions at a record shop owned by the family of Ritsuko Mukae, a classmate. The slice of life series follows Kaoru, Sentar≈ç, and Ritsuko over the course of their three years of high school, and the relationships that develop among and between them. Characters =Primary characters= ; : :A high school student from a wealthy family who moves to his uncle's home in Kyushu in the summer of 1966.

It was serialized in the monthly josei (aimed at teenaged girls and adult women) manga magazine Monthly Flowers from 28 September 2007 to 28 July 2012. In Japan, the series was collected into ten tank≈çbon volumes published by Shogakukan from 25 April 2008 to 9 November 2012. The series' run consists of the original 90 chapter series, collected as the first to ninth tank≈çbon volumes, and Kids on the Slope: Bonus Track, a spin-off series that was released immediately following the conclusion of the manga series; Bonus Track was published as its own unnumbered tank≈çbon. Internationally, the series has been licensed in French, Spanish, Italian, and Taiwanese Mandarin. =Anime= Development Masao Maruyama produced the anime adaptation of Kids on the Slope. An anime adaptation of Kids on the Slope produced by MAPPA in association with Tezuka Productions was released in 2012. It was the first anime series produced by MAPPA, which was founded by Masao Maruyama in 2011 after his departure from the studio Madhouse. Maruyama co-founded Madhouse in 1972, and approached Shinichir≈ç Watanabe to direct Kids on the Slope on the basis of their previous work at Madhouse together. Watanabe spent the three years prior to the release of Kids on the Slope developing projects for Madhouse that ultimately stalled in planning phases or were cancelled, leading Maruyama to offer Watanabe the series to direct \\"as something to do.\\" The series was heralded as a \\"triumphant return to the mainstream\\" for Watanabe following a seven-year hiatus from directing anime, which spanned from the conclusion of his previous series Samurai Champloo in 2005. Kids on the Slope was Watanabe's first anime series adapted from an existing work, rather than based on an original concept. Maruyama stated that Watanabe initially resisted the prospect of creating an adaptation and expressed concerns over a lack of creative freedom, but agreed after learning that the series was about jazz (music frequently forms a core element of Watanabe's works), and after Kids on the Slope network Fuji TV agreed to greenlight his subsequent anime series Terror in Resonance. After reading the original Kids on the Slope manga, Watanabe noted that while jazz music forms the basis of the story, he was interested in its approach to plot and characterization, particularly \\"the kind of way that it portrays emotional distance.\\" Upon learning that Watanabe was developing a new anime series, composer Yoko Kanno asked to be involved in its production. While Kanno has stated that she is not a fan of jazz music, she sought to be involved in Watanabe's next project after their previous collaborations on Macross Plus and Cowboy Bebop. Production The primary production staff for Kids on the Slope is composed of Watanabe as director, Kanno as composer, Nobuteru Y≈´ki as character designer, Yoshimitsu Yamashita as chief animation director, and Ayako Kat≈ç and Y≈´ko Kakihara as scriptwriters. The series was Watanabe's first single cour series; on adapting the series with a compressed number of episodes, Watanabe noted that a manga series of Kids on the Slopes length would typically have been adapted as 15 or 16 episodes, \\"so trying to fit it into 12 episodes necessitated a bit of rushing.\\" Maruyama estimates that \\"about half\\" of the production time and budget for the series went towards creating its musical performance scenes. Though Maruyama had experience depicting musical performances in animation through his work on Beck: Mongolian Chop Squad and Forest of Piano at Madhouse, he found that \\"jazz performance turned out to be a huge challenge.\\" Despite pressure to render the performance scenes as computer-generated imagery to reduce time and costs, Watanabe rendered these scenes using hand-drawn animation by utilizing motion capture: live-action video of musicians performing the scene's music was filmed from multiple angles, which was edited into a single \\"scene\\" that animators used as photo reference. Watanabe and Kanno found jazz artists to perform the series' soundtrack and motion capture by searching videos on YouTube. They sought young artists who were \\"rough and therefore charming,\\" with Watanabe noting that it \\"would be terrible if we asked veteran studio musicians to perform it in a \\"young style'.\\" Pianist Takashi Matsunaga and drummer were cast to record the music and motion capture for Kaoru and Sentar≈ç, respectively. Music The series' soundtrack consists of an original score and cover versions of existing jazz songs. Each episode of the series is named after a jazz standard, with the titles, lyrics, and/or music of each song typically having significance with regards to the events of the episode. As majority of the series' music consists of diegetic jazz performance, its score is minimal, with Kanno noting that Kids on the Slope is a \\"work built on the jazz part alone, and we'd just need music for atmosphere.\\" While Kanno was initially told by Watanabe that she would only have to produce the score for the series, she ultimately produced both its score and jazz performances. In preparation for the series, Kanno visited jazz clubs and researched recording techniques of the 1950s and 1960s; for Kaoru and Sentar≈ç's performance scenes, Kanno elected to record both drums and piano simultaneously (rather than record the instruments separately and later arrange them digitally, as is standard in modern music production) to emulate these recording techniques. Kanno collaborated with disc jockeys and on the series' score, stating that she sought their involvement not to bring a contemporary \\"DJ sound\\" to the 1960s setting, but to instead capture a sense of \\"youth\\" in the music. The series uses two pieces of theme music: its opening theme \\"\\" is written and performed by Yuki, while its closing theme \\"\\" is written and performed by Motohiro Hata. Due to production delays, the opening sequence was animated before its music was produced; delays also forced the opening sequence to be produced by a staff that was entirely separate from the main series animation staff, a move Maruyama noted as \\"not something you see with anime very often.\\" Release The adaptation was announced in the December 2011 issue of Monthly Flowers. K≈çji Yamamoto, the producer of Fuji TV's Noitamina programming block, confirmed that same month that the series would air on the network beginning in April. The first trailer for the series was released in January 2012, alongside an announcement of the series' production staff. The twelve-episode series aired on Noitamina from 12 April to 28 June 2012. In English-language markets, the series is licensed by Sentai Filmworks and aired on the streaming service Crunchyroll, which simulcast the series during its original broadcast run. An English language dubbed version of the series was also produced by Sentai Filmworks; episodes aired on Anime Network and Hulu one month after streaming on Crunchyroll. Sentai Filmworks additionally produced the North American home video release of Kids on the Slope, which was released on Blu-ray and DVD on 7 May 2013. In 2014, the series aired on Viz Media's now-defunct streaming service Neon Alley. =Live-action film= A live-action film adaptation of Kids on the Slope was announced in the June 2017 issue of Monthly Flowers published on 27 April 2017. Kids on the Slope publisher Shogakukan confirmed the adaptation the following day, along with an announcement of the film's cast and primary production staff. The film is directed by Takahiro Miki with a screenplay by , and stars Yuri Chinen as Kaoru, Taishi Nakagawa as Sentar≈ç, and Nana Komatsu as Ritsuko. The actors underwent speech and music training in advance of production, with Chinen and Nakagawa studying piano and drums, respectively, and Nakagawa and Komatsu trained to speak in a Sasebo dialect; Dean Fujioka, who portrays Junichi, was trained to play the trumpet. The trailer for the film was released on 15 October 2017, with the film itself released on 10 March 2018. =Other media= Several soundtrack albums collecting music from the series have been published. In 2009, EMI Music Japan published Kids on the Slope Original Soundtrack, a compilation album collecting songs referenced in the manga series. The album is composed of both licensed original recordings and cover versions by the Japanese jazz quartet Quasimode. In 2012, Epic Records Japan published the identically-titled Kids on the Slope Original Soundtrack, which collects songs used in the anime adaption of the series and Yoko Kanno's original score; an expanded edition of the soundtrack, Kids on the Slope Original Soundtrack: Plus More & Rare, was published that same year. In 2018, Ariola Japan published Kids on the Slope Soundtrack & Jazz Music Collection, which collects the soundtrack of the live-action film adaptation of the series. A Kids on the Slope weekly internet radio series aired on from 10 April to 3 July 2012. The series was hosted by Kaoru voice actor Ry≈çhei Kimura, and featured voice actors from the anime series as guests. Themes and analysis Kuroshima Church on the Kuj≈´ku Islands near Sasebo, where the final scene of the series occurs. Series creator Yuki Kodama based Kids on the Slope on her own experience of growing up in Sasebo, Nagasaki, where the series is set. Jazz figured heavily in Sasebo's music scene beginning in the 1920s and 1930s; the city houses a major naval base for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (then the Imperial Japanese Navy), which attracted nightclubs and cabarets to the area. Several real-life locations in and around Sasebo appear in Kids on the Slope, notably the Megane-iwa ( \\"Spectacles Rock\\"), and the Kuroshima Catholic church on the Kuj≈´ku Islands. In his book Holy Anime! Japan's View of Christianity, writer Patrick Drazen remarks on the series' depiction of Catholicism in Japan, citing Kids on the Slope as an example of how \\"in the Japanese scheme of things, religion can be a factor of geography and even genetics, and [is] not exclusively a profession of faith.\\" In particular, Drazen notes how the stigmatization Sentar≈ç faces because of his hƒÅfu racial identity is compounded by his Catholic religious identity. Drazen further identifies Kids on the Slope as an example of a work that juxtaposes Catholicism and Western popular music, comparing it to media such as \\"Dominique\\" by The Singing Nun and the Sister Act series of films. Multiple critics noted a homoerotic dimension to Kaoru and Sentar≈ç's canonically platonic friendship. Jacob Parker-Dalton of Otaquest cites the series' gay subtext as an example of the influence of the yaoi genre (male-male romance) on the josei demographic, noting how Sentar≈ç and Kaoru conform to typical seme and uke (\\"top\\" and \\"bottom\\") character archetypes. Writer Madeline Ashby argues that though its gay content is rendered as subtext, Kids on the Slope represents Watanabe's first attempt to engage seriously with LGBT subject material in his work, after previously depicting LGBT characters in passing or as the punchlines for jokes. Parker-Dalton notes that Watanabe's works subsequent to Kids on the Slope similarly feature serious portrayals of LGBT characters and themes, as seen in the bish≈çnen-style character designs of Terror in Resonance and the presence of multiple LGBT characters in Carole & Tuesday. Kids on the Slope was also discussed by critics in relation to Watanabe's broader canon of works, with Parker-Dalton identifying the series as a \\"watershed\\" moment for Watanabe's career representing \\"the final evolution of the director‚Äôs lifelong obsession with music.\\" Ashby notes how the series' theme of male friendship is one that recurs in Watanabe's works, which depict \\"unlikely pairs of men (or boys) who are either thrown together by circumstance or are drawn together by their mutual histories.\\" She argues that Kids on the Slope represents metatextual commentary by Watanabe on his previous works Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, as he uses design elements, setting, and characterization to \\"evoke [his] other works while keeping each story completely independent.\\" Reception The manga was the top-ranked manga for women in the 2009 edition of Takarajimasha's annual Kono Manga ga Sugoi! rankings and won the 57th Shogakukan Manga Award in 2012 for general manga. Reviewing the first volume of the series for The Asahi Shimbun, critic Shigeko Matsuo praised Kodama's characterization, but criticized its love triangle plot conceit. The anime adaptation of Kids on the Slope was acclaimed by critics, and was listed as among the best anime of 2012 by Anime News Network, among the best anime of the 2010s by IGN, Crunchyroll, and Thrillist, and among the best anime of all time by Paste. In 2013, Yoko Kanno won Best Music at the Tokyo Anime Awards for her work on Kids on the Slope and Aquarion Evol. Theron Martin reviewed the series positively for Anime News Network, noting that while Kids on the Slope is \\"more pedestrian\\" than Watanabe and Kanno's previous collaborations, he offered praise for its character development, music, and visual style. Otaku USA commended \\"the driving emotion of the music, the animation thereof, and incredibly well-written tale of growing up,\\" calling Watanabe's direction and Kanno's music production as \\"a perfect balance for the series.\\" In his review of the series for IndieWire, Charles Solomon noted that the series showcases Watanabe's \\"versatility as a director and his ability to create characters with depth and believability.\\" Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku wrote that while the series' \\"dreamy, romantic vibe\\" may be off-putting to viewers who discovered Watanabe through his work on Cowboy Bebop, but argued that \\"to dismiss Kids on the Slope would be a huge mistake. Like Cowboy Bebop, Kids is a thing of visual and aural beauty, a celebration of art that lives in its smallest details.\\" Nicoletta Christina Browne of THEM Anime similarly concurred that while the series \\"moves slowly and thus may not gain widespread appeal,\\" its \\"poignancy and its adept choice of viewpoint as a reflective rather than purely nostalgic show ultimately win out over its mistakes.\\" The live-action film adaption of Kids on the Slope opened in eighth place at the Japanese box office. For his performance in the film, Taishi Nakagawa was nominated for Newcomer of the Year at the 42nd Japan Academy Film Prize awards in 2019.

History =Design and Construction= Netherne Asylum was founded on 18 October 1905 to alleviate overcrowding at the existing Brookwood Asylum near Woking. The hospital was designed by George Thomas Hine, Consultant Architect to the Commissioners in Lunacy to hold 960 patients. The buildings followed the popular compact arrow design, with stepped ward blocks on the outside of a broad semi-circle containing the central services such as the administrative offices, laundry, workshops, water tower, boilers and recreation hall. A freestanding chapel was located to the front of the hospital buildings, while an isolation hospital and patients' cemetery were located some distance to the north of the main buildings. =Early years= The former hospital chapel of St. Luke, now in use as a swimming pool thumbleftPainting of pirate costume design for Netherne pantomime by Edward Adamson Even in its early days, Netherne gained a reputation as a pioneering force in the treatment of mental illness and for setting standards for patient care. Inmates worked on the hospital's extensive estate, in the hospital workshops, in the laundry or were employed in various handicrafts. In their leisure time they could enjoy reading books and newspapers, attend monthly dances and fancy dress parties and a Christmas pantomime in addition to playing indoor and outdoor sports. During the First World War, Netherne took on significant numbers of patients from neighbouring institutions which had been commandeered as War Hospitals. In the 1920s, the hospital was renamed Netherne Mental Hospital, the term 'Asylum' having fallen out of favour. In 1933, Fairdene, a voluntary admissions hospital was opened to the south of the site together with seven new convalescent villas and two female wards. =Wartime Service= Despite recent expansion, the Second World War stretched the hospital's resources with 6 wards and 2 villas being requisitioned for the treatment of air raid casualties. Patients who were able helped to assemble electrical components for a nearby munitions factory and by the end of the war most patients were employed in sustaining the war effort. Over the course of the war, several bombs fell in the grounds and another landed on the nurse's home but failed to explode. =Psychosurgery= In 1942 Eric Cunningham Dax, medical superintendent of Netherne Hospital, called in surgeon Eric Radley Smith to perform psychosurgery on patients. Before the end of the year, fifty patients had undergone surgery, and in April 1943 the results were published in the Journal of Mental Science. Cunningham Dax described how he selected patients: > \\"The operation was carried out with the primary object of relieving the most > disturbed patients in the hospital quite independently of their poor > prognosis. They formed a large proportion of the most violent, hostile, > noisy, excited, destructive or obscene cases in the hospital; the type who > distress their relatives, upset the other patients and consume the time and > energy which could be put to so much better purpose by the staff\\".E > Cunningham Dax and EJ Radley Smith 1943 The early effects of prefrontal > leucotomy on disturbed patients with mental illness of long duration. > Journal of Mental Science 89: 182-8. Two died of cerebral haemorrhage, two were discharged (of whom one relapsed); of those remaining in hospital two-thirds had shown at least some improvement, needing less staff time and supervision. =Post-War developments= In 1948, the hospital became part of the newly formed National Health Service. In the same year, Eleanor Roosevelt visited, later commenting that hospitals in the United States had a lot to learn from Netherne. The introduction of new drugs in the 1950s caused many changes, including the removal of security fencing. In 1961, following the so-called Water Tower Speech by Minister of Health Enoch Powell which called for mental hospitals to be closed in favour of community care and the use of general hospital acute units, Netherne formed a partnership with Redhill General Hospital in 1965, and the intake of patients was gradually reduced. Christian worship was provided for by St Luke's Anglican Chapel and a Catholic chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes, which opened in November 1964 and which was administered by the Church of Our Lady Help of Christians at Old Coulsdon. Its registration for worship was cancelled in February 2000. =Art therapy and the Adamson Collection= Edward Adamson From 1946, Netherne became a national centre for art therapy under Edward Adamson, a pioneering art therapist and the first chairman of the British Association of Art Therapists.Hogan, S. (2001). Healing Arts: the history of art therapy. London, Jessica Kingsley Publishers. Adamson established five art studios at the hospital, focusing on art as a means for people to express themselves and communicate their feelings.Adamson E. (1970). Art for Health in The Social Context of Art. Jean Creddy. Tavistock, London During his time at Netherne, Adamson worked with hundreds of patients, including the painter William Kurelek and sculptor Rolanda Polonsky.Adamson, E. (1984). Art as Healing. London, Coventure He continued to work at the hospital until his retirement in 1981. Adamson gathered the works of those compelled to live at Netherne in great number, amassing a considerable collection, estimated at 100,000 at his retirement in 1981; and selected works were on show at a purpose built gallery opened at Netherne in 1956. After Adamson's death in 1996, the Adamson Collection was moved to Lambeth Hospital, part of South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, and during 2012 and 2013 almost all re-located to the Wellcome Library in anticipation of a securer future in several international institutions. The Adamson Collection now comprises approximately 6000 paintings, drawings, sculptures and ceramics, and is of great international and historical importance.O'Flynn, D. (2011). 'Art as Healing: Edward Adamson'. Raw Vision, 72, Spring 2011, p46-53. =Decline and Redevelopment= Following a steady decline in patient numbers from almost two thousand in the 1950s to 750 in 1986 and just 150 in 1990, the hospital finally closed in 1994 and the remaining 150 patients were integrated into the local community under a supported care programme. The former hospital estate was sold by the Secretary of State for Health to developer M J Gleeson in 1995. The development, known as Netherne-on-the-Hill, included about 440 houses, a nursing home, a business centre, a shop, a public house and recreational open space.

The blog was started in 2011 by veteran writer and sports journalist Bill Simmons, who remained as editor-in-chief until May 2015. Grantland was named after famed early-20th-century sportswriter Grantland Rice (1880‚Äì1954). On October 30, 2015, ESPN announced that it was ending the publication of Grantland. Writers The site featured contributions from Simmons alongside other sports and pop-culture writers and podcasters including: Holly Anderson, Mallory Rubin, Katie Baker, Bill Barnwell, Rembert Browne, Andy Greenwald, Bryan Curtis, Kirk Goldsberry, Steven Hyden, Michael Weinreb, David Jacoby, Jonah Keri, Chuck Klosterman, Molly Lambert, Mark Lisanti, Zach Lowe, Robert Mays, Davy Rothbart, Sean McIndoe, Brian Phillips, Charles P. Pierce, former NBA player Jalen Rose, Shea Serrano, Andrew Sharp, Louisa Thomas and Mark Titus. Former contributors include Men in Blazers duo Roger Bennett and Michael Davies, Spike Friedman, Tom Bissell, Lane Brown, Jason Concepcion, author Dave Eggers, author Malcolm Gladwell, Justin Halpern, Mark Harris, Jay Caspian Kang, screenwriter of the movie Rounders Brian Koppelman, Juliet Litman, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Wesley Morris, Chris Ryan, MacArthur Award-winning novelist Colson Whitehead and Emily Yoshida. Editor-in-Chief transition In May 2015, ESPN's President John Skipper told The New York Times that ESPN would not be renewing Simmons' contract, effectively ending Simmons' tenure at ESPN. Later in the month, Chris Connelly was announced as interim editor-in-chief.  Dr. V controversy  An article written by Caleb Hannan and published on the Grantland website in January 2014 received considerable criticism from the transgender community. Hannan's article was about the Oracle GXI golf putter and its creator, Essay Anne Vanderbilt, referred to as Dr. V. It treated Vanderbilt's transgender identity in the same manner as a number of scientific qualifications that Vanderbilt had fraudulently claimed to hold, suggesting that Hannan considered Vanderbilt's gender identity to be untruthful as well. Before the article was published, Vanderbilt committed suicide. After initially dismissing all criticisms and drawing even more fire, Grantlands editor-in-chief Bill Simmons published a response to the criticism, acknowledging errors made by Grantland and Hannan, including Hannan's outing of Vanderbilt to one of her investors and Grantlands \\"collective ignorance about the issues facing the transgender community in general, as well as our biggest mistake: not educating ourselves on that front before seriously considering whether to run the piece\\". A profile of Simmons in Rolling Stone, published in April 2014, lambasted him at length over the Dr. V matter and incorporated criticism from senior ESPN personnel, but also included Simmons' defenses and disagreements with some of the harsher criticisms of the article.  Grantland shut down  On October 30, 2015, ESPN officially announced the shut down of Grantland: ‚ÄúAfter careful consideration, we have decided to direct our time and energy going forward to projects that we believe will have a broader and more significant impact across our enterprise.‚Äù The closing of Grantland was met with harsh criticism of ESPN, from both former writers of Grantland and admirers of the site. Former Editor- in-Chief Bill Simmons called the shut down ‚Äúsimply appalling.‚Äù ESPN president John Skipper said the decision to shut down the site was not a financial matter and instead was done because ESPN did not see the value in spending the time and energy necessary to continue the excellence of Grantland. Grantlands closure was seen by many as another blow against long-form journalism. Huffington Post writer Justin Block writes, ‚ÄúIn an era ruled by bite-sized content and dumbed-down click-bait journalism, Grantlands defining characteristic came at odds with sustainable finances.‚Äù Grantlands articles were often long form and usually not instant but measured reactionary pieces, a trend not common in today's media landscape. Grantland was considered by some to be the highest-quality work under the umbrella of ESPN and received critical acclaim, but its financial success has been widely debated. Grantland received 6 million unique visitors in March 2015, a number that some people believed could not support a staff of 50 writers, editors and IT personnel. The shutdown was also coming at a time of relative financial uncertainty for ESPN. In September 2015, ESPN laid off 300 employees or approximately 5% of its workforce. It has also been widely reported that in 2015 ESPN lost 3.2 million subscribers due to consumers abandoning traditional cable packages.  Content and legacy  Grantland was known for its long-form journalism and award-winning writing. Its sports journalism pieces often had a strong focus on sports analytics and data analysis, referencing and pulling data from sites like Football Outsiders, Baseball Prospectus, Synergy, and ESPN. Grantland wove statistics into part of the story and made the analytics understandable to the average sports fan. As Stephen Carter from the Chicago Tribune put it, \\"This was sportswriting for grownups.\\" These pieces would also often include a data visualization representation. Some have concluded that Grantlands closure represents a trend in today's media business that unless you are one of the biggest web properties or smallest one-person ‚Äúmicro sites‚Äù it's tough to be economically viable. Simmons started a new media venture in 2016, The Ringer, which, like Grantland, focuses on sports and pop culture. A number of former Grantland employees, including Sean Fennessey, Chris Ryan, Mallory Rubin, Juliet Litman, Craig Gaines, Bryan Curtis, Ryan O'Hanlon, Danny Chau, Shea Serrano, Jason Concepcion, Riley McAtee, Joe Fuentes, and Tate Frazier have joined the new venture. Additionally, Simmons has launched a podcasting network, featuring shows re-purposed from the Grantland network, including The Watch with Ryan and television critic Andy Greenwald and his own podcast The Bill Simmons Podcast. Ryan and Greenwald will also host a Game of Thrones re- cap show on HBO modeled after their Grantland podcast \\"Watch the Thrones\\" and produced by Simmons. Simmons debuted a weekly show on HBO, titled Any Given Wednesday with Bill Simmons, on June 22, 2016.

This Dust Was Once the Man is an elegy poem by Walt Whitman in 1871. The poem is dedicated to Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States. The poem was written six years after Lincoln's assassination. Whitman had written three previous poems about Lincoln, all in 1865: \\"O Captain! My Captain!\\", \\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\\", and \\"Hush'd Be the Camps To-Day. This Dust Was Once the Man was included in Book XXII of Whitman's Leaves of Grass. Background = Walt Whitman and Abraham Lincoln = Whitman first became interested in Abraham Lincoln in the beginning of the American Civil War. He felt that Lincoln could be a great leader as early as 1860, and grew to admire him. Whitman's brother George had been serving in the Union Army and was wounded at the Battle of Fredericksburg, prompting Whitman to travel to Washington D.C. from New York in 1862 to take care of his brother. While in the capital Whitman's admiration for the president blossomed. Although they never directly met in person, Whitman saw Lincoln multiple times from 1862 to 1865, sometimes from close quarters. Whitman was struck by the President's appearance and unpretentious dignity, and trusted Lincoln's \\"supernatural tact\\" and \\"idiomatic Western genius\\"\\". He admired the President, writing in October 1863, \\"I love the President personally\\". Whitman considered himself and Lincoln to be \\"afloat in the same stream\\" and \\"rooted in the same ground\\". Whitman and Lincoln shared similar views on slavery and the Union, revered heroes of the American Revolution, did not practice any certain religion, came from working-class origins, and used Jacksonian populism rhetoric. In addition, their literary styles were somewhat similar, both being inspired by the Bible, Shakespeare, Thomas Paine, Robert Burns, American vernacular speech, American political oratory, and American drama. Upon realizing these similarities, Whitman later declared that \\"Lincoln gets almost nearer me than anybody else\\". There is an account of Lincoln reading Whitman's Leaves of Grass poetry collection in his office, and another of the President saying \\"Well, he looks like a man!\\" upon seeing Whitman in Washington, D.C., but these accounts are most likely fictitious. Lincoln's death on April 15, 1865 greatly moved Whitman, who proceeded to write multiple poems in tribute to the fallen President. \\"O Captain! My Captain!\\", \\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\\", \\"Hush'd be the Camps To-day\\", and \\"This Dust was Once the Man\\" were all written as sequels to Drum-Taps. Although the poems do not specifically mention Lincoln, they turn the assassination of the President into a sort of martyrdom. Text > This dust was once the man, > Gentle, plain, just and resolute, under whose cautious hand, > Against the foulest crime in history known in any land or age, > Was saved the Union of these States.  Publication history  Whitman wrote the poem in 1871 and published it in the \\"President Lincoln's Burial Hymn\\" cluster of Passage to India. It was republished in the \\"Memories of President Lincoln\\" cluster, first in the 1871-1872 edition of Leaves of Grass. It is the only poem in this cluster that was not first in Drum-Taps or Sequel to Drum-Taps. The poem was not revised after its first publication.  Analysis  In contrast to Whitman's earlier poems on Lincoln, which describe him as a leader, or as a friend, or as \\"a wise and sweet soul\\", he is simply dust. Helen Vendler consider's it Lincoln's epitaph. Whitman \\"grasps the dust to himself\\". She continues to argue that the epitaph is unbalanced. Half of the poems meaning is contained in \\"this dust\\", and the following thirty words constitute the other half. She notes that dust is light, while Lincoln himself holds \\"complex historical weight\\". In the second line, Vendler notes the difference between 'gentle', which she considers a \\"personal\\" word, and the final, \\"official\\", descriptor of 'resolute'. She considers it surprising that the poem \\"gives no active verb to its subject\\", instead describing Lincoln as primus inter pares, the 'cautious' guiding hand of the nation. Whitman writes in the third line: 'the foulest crime known in any land or age.' Ed Folsom argues that the 'foulest crime' could refer instead to secession and notes that many 'Whitmanians' view the phrase as referring to secession. In contrast, Vendler writes that this is a euphemism to refer to slavery. In Lincoln and The Poets, William Wilson Betts writes that it is instead the assassination of Lincoln that is called the \\"foulest crime in history\\". In 2019, Folsom wrote that \\"it is almost always assumed\\" the 'foulest crime' is \\"not slavery but either secession itself or the assassination of Lincoln\\". The phrase 'foulest crime' likely came from Herman Melville's Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War. Melville is generally considered to have been referring to slavery. Roy Morris considers the crime to be ‚Äúa heartbreaking civil war that filled the hospitals of the capital with the ruined bodies of beautiful young soldiers.‚Äù Edward W. Huffstetler writes that the 'foulest crime' is \\"of course, secession\\" and argues that \\"nowhere do Whitman's feelings for the South take on a more bitter tone\\" than in \\"This Dust\\". In Secular Lyric, John Michael draws comparisons between the poem and the Book of Common Prayer, saying that it emphasizes the \\"materiality of the body\\" and conveys grief through \\"understatement\\" by \\"refusing conventional rhetorical gestures of ornamentation or consolation\\". Lincoln's preservation of the union serves to make his assassination \\"more poignant\\". Michael particularly highlights the simplicity of dust, noting that Whitman doesn't rely on metaphors or other poetical devices to convey Lincoln's death as opposed to \\"O Captain! My Captain!\\" which utilizes the Ship of State metaphor and makes Lincoln a quasi-religious figure. Instead, Whitman forces the reader to face the \\"brute fact of mortality\\", as Lincoln has been reduced to dust. Deak Nabers notes that Whitman doesn't mention emancipation in the epitaph and is careful not to attribute the saving of the Union to Lincoln himself, instead saying that it was preserved \\"under [Lincoln's] hand\\", while still giving Lincoln credit for his work. Similar He draws comparisons between the poem and Herman Melville's \\"The House-Top\\" and William Wells Brown's Clotel. The final line inverts the standard \\"United States was saved\\" to \\"Was saved the Union of these States\\", which Vendler concludes gives the Union a \\"climactic syntactic position of national value\\". Vendler concludes her analysis by saying that the poem has \\"Roman succinctness and taciturnity\\" and makes \\"dust [...] equal in weight to the salvation of the Union\\".  Reception  In 1943, Henry Seidel Canby wrote that Whitman's poems on Lincoln have become known as \\"the poems of Lincoln\\" and noted the \\"fine lines\\" of \\"This Dust\\". William E. Barton wrote in 1965 that neither \\"This Dust\\" and \\"Hush'd be the Camps\\" \\"would have attracted much attention at the time or have added anything later to the poets reputation\\". Martha C. Nussbaum considers the epitaph \\"one of Whitman‚Äôs simplest and most eloquent statements\\".

They were only able to work on Wild Life part-time, due to commercial obligations, and the film is reported to have taken them from six to over seven years, from concept to completion. Careers Both originally from Alberta, they first met in Vancouver at the Emily Carr College of Art and Design. In 2003, they relocated from Montreal to Calgary, where Forbis was raised. In addition to their NFB work, they have collaborated on workshops and commercials, working with Los Angeles-based Acme Filmworks on major ad campaigns, most notably for United Airlines.

When the Day Breaks (1999) awards & festivals on MUBI and Grand Prix at the World Festival of Animated Film - Animafest Zagreb. Tilby was also nominated individually for her 1991 NFB short Strings. Personal lives =Wendy Tilby= Wendy Tilby was born in 1960 in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Tilby studied visual arts and literature at the University of Victoria before studying film and animation at the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design, where she met Forbis. Tilby used to teach animation at Harvard and Concordia University. Tilby was also external examiner for animation at the Royal College of Art in London from 2007-2009.ABOUT & CONTACT-TILBY/FORBIS =Amanda Forbis= Amanda Forbis attended the University of Lethbridge as well as the Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design. Like Tilby, she went on from the Emily Carr Institute to complete animation work for the National Film Board of Canada on the 1995 short The Reluctant Deckhand. Forbis has also worked as an instructor at the Arts Umbrella Children's Art Centre in Vancouver, as well as leading many animation workshops for children. Animation Styles =Strings= This film was not a collaboration between Tilby and Forbis, it was only worked on by Tilby. The animation style used is reminiscent of Caroline Leaf's method of painting on frosted glass, used in her 1976 short film, The Street. However, Tilby used bottom-lighting in her film, instead of top lighting like Caroline Leaf. She used an animation camera apparatus and worked directly under the camera, she applied, moved, and removed the colored paints on the glass until the frame was finished. When the frame was complete she took two frames worth of footage from the overhead camera. Then she would modify the image to make the next frame, and repeat the process. To make details on the characters' faces and in their body language Tilby used a stylus and scratched details into the paint. She also used her fingers, q-tips, and tissues to move the paint around the glass and change the scene. Tilby enjoys using this method because the artist erases the previous work as they go, and it forces her not to dwell on what she has already shot and keep going with the filming.Jones, G. W. (1991). CANADIAN PRESERVE FOR AN ENDANGERED SPECIES: THE FREE ANIMATOR. Post Script, 10(3), 13-29 =When the Day Breaks= This film was co-directed by Tilby and Forbis and was made using a new animation technique that they designed. The duo used a Hi-8 video camera and shot real life scenes of people and objects, the film focuses in on many mundane inanimate objects, and other things that they thought they might include. They then printed stills from these scenes on a video printer attached to a VCR as three by four inch images that they enlarged slightly. They then would take these stills and draw on them. This technique was designed to save time, however, the film took about four years to complete. =Wild Life= In the making of Wild Life Tilby and Forbis experimented with many different techniques for animation. They wanted to find a technique that would save them some time, the last film they had made took them four years. However, they also wanted to make sure their technique allowed them to get the look and style that they wanted for their film. They tried many computer drawing and hybrid techniques in an effort to save time, however, they eventually found that the computer drawing wouldn't work, as the effect was too clean and it didn't seem right for this film. They decided to print their images onto paper and use gouache painting. They then scanned these images onto the computer and would sometimes do some composting on some of the images. This process ended up taking about seven years, however, they achieved the texture and style that they wanted to with the film.Oscar 2012: Wendy Tilby and Amanda Forbis Talk 'Wild Life'Animation World Network References External links * * Directors' page Acme filmworks * for Wendy Tilby and Amanda Forbis Category:Living people Category:Animation duos Category:Artists from Edmonton Category:Canadian animators Category:Canadian animated film directors Category:Canadian animated film producers Category:Canadian women film directors Category:Emily Carr University of Art and Design alumni Category:Film directors from Edmonton Category:Film festival founders Category:National Film Board of Canada people Category:Women animators Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Wendy Tilby and Amanda Forbis"},{"id":"34495752","text":"Icarus Interstellar is an international organization dedicated to technical achievements enabling interstellar travel. Research is performed by volunteer citizen scientists with a wide swath of backgrounds, ranging from NASA and ESA aerospace engineers to professional scientists, university professors, students, science fiction writers, artists, thinkers and enthusiasts. Design teams are coordinated around research projects with a central theme, such as Project Icarus, an interstellar probe design study envisioning the design of a mainly fusion propulsion based engine, and Project Hyperion, a human occupied worldship (interstellar migration ship) study. Organizationally, Icarus is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizationhttp://commerce.alaska.gov/CBP/Main/CorporationDetail.aspx?id=133623 registered in Alaska, February 2011. The organization was created from members of Project Icarus, initiated in September 2009 in an effort to explore multiple interstellar spacecraft systems simultaneously. History Icarus Interstellar was founded by Andreas Tziolas, Richard Obousy, Kelvin Long, Pat Galea and Adam Crowl, all members of the original Project Icarus study group. In an interview, Tziolas stated that the project name was chosen both due to a hint from Daedalus project leader Alan Bond and as a result of a \\"reshaped\\" mythos in which Icarus lands on an island and plans to forge steel wings to replace his father's wax wings. Icarus Interstellar's mission statement reads as follows: With its hundred-year scale, Icarus seeks to select as destination a star like Alpha Centauri within a radius of 15 light years, or a potentially habitable terrestrial planet if discovered within a radius of 22 light years. Structure Icarus Interstellar's board and members are widespread by a variety of geographic locales, backgrounds and areas of expertise. Board members work in a volunteer capacity. The organization has six directors, as follows: *Andreas Tziolas, president, education and outreach director *Richard Obousy, treasurer *Robert Freeland, secretary *Adam Crowl, director *Bill Cress, director *Robert Swinney, director The organization has an experimental committee, a fund development committee, a public outreach committee, an education committee and a Starship Congress committee. It seeks to add interstellar engineering training to American and European aerospace education, and to design games that would attract interest in interstellar exploration for \\"mindshare\\" purposes. Students at Drexel University formed a student chapter of Icarus Interstellar in 2013, founded by Damien Turchi, John Breslin, Michael Daily, Zachary Block, and David Evinshteyn. The student chapter is primarily focused on Project Tin Tin (an Icarus Interstellar initiative to create a CubeSat interstellar probe) and Project Icarus. Their work on Project Icarus looks at the possibility of a plasma jet magneto inertial fusion propulsion system in the development of a starship. The chapter has recruited over 60 student members as of 2015.http://www.drexel.edu/now/features/archive/2013/December/Icarus- Interstellar-Chapter/ Icarus Interstellar fiscally sponsored the foundation of the Anchorage Makerspacehttp://www.anchoragemakerspace.org in December 2013, as an open source community-driven space and technical innovation research lab. Projects Icarus Interstellar has several projects all relating to the exploration of space. These include: *Project Icarus, launched in September 2009 by Kelvin Long and Richard Obousy. Project Icarus is a five-year theoretical design study for a fusion based starship. It starts from the original 1970s Project Daedalus study conducted by members of the British Interplanetary Society.https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/18/science/space/18starship.htmlhttps://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/02/project- icarus-laying-the-plans-for-interstellar-travel/253335/ Project Icarus is the flagship project of Icarus Interstellar, being its first design study. *Project Tin Tin, an Icarus Interstellar initiative to create a CubeSat interstellar probe. *Project Hyperion, launched in December 2011 by Andreas Hein. Project Hyperion is to perform a preliminary study that defines integrated concepts for a crewed interstellar starship. This is a two-year study mainly based out of the WARR student group at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). The study aims to provide an assessment of the feasibility of manned interstellar flight using current and near-future technoloigies. It also aims to guide future research and technology development plans as well as reassess the Fermi Paradox. Finally it aims to inform the public about the prospects of manned interstellar flight. *Project Forward, launched in December 2011, by James Benford. Project Forward has the purpose of exploring beamed energy propulsion. The project is named in honor of the late Dr. Robert Forward, a pioneer in the field of interstellar travel research. Project Forward aims to analyze and assess past beam energy concepts, describe the construction and assembly of sail designs and provide a detailed starsail system concept. Challenges include lossy divergence of the beam (transmitted from solar energy focused by a ground or orbital station) and sail design at feasible sizes (that is, smaller than a theoretical design size of roughly a hundred square kilometers). *Project Persephone, launched in October 2011, by Dr. Rachel Armstrong (University of Greenwich). Project Persephone focuses on research and development of living or sustainable architectures for worldships. Project Persephone takes an ecological, rather than mechanical, approach to designing the interior of a worldship that could sustain an ecosystem independent of a host planet.http://news.discovery.com/space/private-spaceflight/project-persephone- icarus-interstellar-100yss-120920.htm Through research into the sustainable environments necessary to sustain an entirely self-contained worldship, Dr. Armstrong hopes to also improve life in cities on Earth.https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/esmagazine/planet-organic-the- professor-who-wants-to-send-a-city-into-space-9376307.html Project Persephone is a research project conducted by Icarus Interstellar, the University of Greenwich, and others.http://www2.gre.ac.uk/about/schools/adc/research/centres/avatar/research/pp A cylindrical ship 20 km long and 5 km in diameter, with simulated gravity, has been proposed with an ecosystem that can sustain 50 to 500 people. Synthetic soil \\"grown specifically for that particular environment\\" has been proposed, with burrows for human habitation. *Project Bifrost, launched in December 2011, by Tabitha Smith. The Icarus Interstellar Nuclear Space Technology (NST) and Propulsion Development Program operates with long-term goals of tangible deliverables in mind, such as (1) partnership with the United States government and other vital members of the NST community, (2) the creation of nuclear engines (thermal (NTR) and/or electric) and (3) proof of concept for NTR engines and building the foundation for evolving nuclear propulsion. *Project Helius, launched in August 2011, by Richard Osborne and Kelvin Long. Project Helius has the purpose of building prototype pulsed propulsion demonstrators to test elements of the Daedalus (or other) architecture. The main areas of study are currently focused on the tracking of pellets and the timing of laser devices. *Project Orion, researched by Freeman Dyson. Project Orion is a division that studies the use of nuclear fission pulse units that detonate to provide thrust to the spacecraft. *Project Voyager, launched in summer of 2014, by Zachary Fejes. Project Voyager surrounds the development of interplanetary and interstellar scale mission planning, analysis, and simulation software. Icarus Interstellar also researches communications methods such as point-to-point laser, use of abandoned fuel tanks as relay stations, or use of moderated fusion pulses to code as signal communications. In addition, Icarus Interstellar is supporting experiments into exotic propulsion techniques such as faster-than-light warp drive.https://www.space.com/21721-warp-drives-wormholes-ftl.html As the theory is somewhat speculative at this stage, these experiments are designed to test the theory at a fundamental level to determine whether it is consistent with real physics.
