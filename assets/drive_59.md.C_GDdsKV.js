Despite the name, the neighbourhood has not been a traditional village since the years before Malaysia gained independence in 1958, when government quarters were built. More recently these quarters have been demolished to make way for redevelopment. Situated just at the edge of Johor Baru city center, the old neighbourhood had the feel of a rural kampong with low density single-storey houses, mature trees, a prominent mosque, community center and kindergarten. However, the houses had become dilapidated. When the state government decided to move its administrative offices to Kota Iskandar, it also took steps to redevelop the land with more modern and higher density housing. In the latter part of 2009, the government quarters were demolished and work on the new houses began. Location Kampong Nong Chik lies along the hill slope between Jalan Kolam Air to the west which runs parallel to Sungai Chat, Jalan Abdul Samad which passes along the ridge of the hill to the east, Taman Nong Chik with high end detached houses in the north and Aloha Towers ‚Äì a luxury condominium ‚Äì in the south.

Malaysian Association for the Blind website,retrieved 9 August 2010 History Kampong Nong Chik lies on land first granted to a businessman of Arab descent by Sultan Abu Bakar (1833‚Äì1895). Syed Muhammd Alsagoff (1836‚Äì1906), also known as Nong Chik, gave his name to the kampong that he established. Syed Mohamed Alsagoff was the grandson of Tuan Syed Abdul Rahman Alsagoff, an Arab businessman from Hadramaut in Yemen who came to the new British colony of Singapore with his son, Syed Ahmad, in 1824. Syed Abdul Rahman established Alsagoff & Company in Singapore in 1848 which traded in spices, rubber, sago, coffee, coco, pineapples and others. Apart from trading it also had a plantation, the largest sawmill in the region and the Straits Cycle & Motor Company. When Syed Abdul Rahman died, all his business were inherited by Syed Ahmed Alsagoff. Syed Ahmed married Raja Siti, the daughter of Hajjah Fatimah of Sulawesi who was herself a rich business woman who owned many cargo ships. When Hajah Fatimah died, her business was run by her son-in- law Syed Ahmed, adding to his wealth. Syed Ahmed had nine girls and one boy. When he died in 1875, the family's wealth was passed down to Syed Mohamed Alsagoff in trust. Syed Mohamed Alsagoff was close to Sultan Abu Bakar of Johor; apart from the Nong Chik land, he also received a large concession in Kukup. He set up Constantinople Estates which grew rubber, sago, cocoa and pepper. He even received permission from the Sultan to issue his own currency at the Constantinople Estate.

He was very powerful during the reign of his grandnephew Emperor Xiaoming, and by corrupt means grew very rich. This, however, drew resentment from the populace, and after Emperor Xiaoming's death in 528 and the subsequent overthrowing of Emperor Xiaoming's mother Empress Dowager Hu by the general Erzhu Rong, Erzhu had him and over 2,000 other officials slaughtered at Heyin (Ê≤≥Èô∞, in modern Luoyang, Henan).  Background  It is not known when Tuoba Yong was born; what is known is that he was the sixth of seven sons of Emperor Xianwen, and that his mother was Emperor Xianwen's concubine Consort Han, who was also the mother of one of his older brothers, Tuoba Gan (ÊãìÊãîÂππ). Emperor Xianwen yielded the throne to Tuoba Yong's oldest brother, Emperor Xiaowen, in 471, and died subsequently in 476, probably murdered by Tuoba Yong's stepgrandmother, Empress Dowager Feng, who then proceeded to assume regency over Emperor Xiaowen. Emperor Xiaowen liked Tuoba Yong for his lack of inhibitions, and while Yuan Yong did not display much talent while young, he believed that Yuan Yong might show those talents later. In 485, Tuoba Yong was created the Prince of Yingchuan. In 494, when Emperor Xiaowen moved the capital from Pingcheng (Âπ≥Âüé, in modern Datong, Shanxi), Tuoba Yong's title was changed to the Prince of Gaoyang. In 496, when Emperor Xiaowen changed the name of the imperial clan from Tuoba to Yuan, Tuoba Yong's name was changed to Yuan Yong. Subsequently, when Emperor Xiaowen conducted his campaigns against rival Southern Qi, Yuan Yong was put in charge of the important Xiang Province (Áõ∏Â∑û), but he, unlike most of his other brothers, was not given any greater authority during Emperor Xiaowen's reign.  During Emperor Xuanwu's reign  Yuan Yong was honored, but not particularly powerful, after Emperor Xiaowen's death in 499 and succession by his oldest son Emperor Xuanwu, unlike his brothers Yuan Xi (ÂÖÉÁ¶ß) the Prince of Xianyang, Yuan Xie the Prince of Pengcheng, and Yuan Xiang (ÂÖÉË©≥) the Prince of Beihai, each of whom received substantial powers. After Yuan Yong served a further stint as the governor of Ji Province (ÂÜÄÂ∑û, modern central Hebei), Emperor Xuanwu recalled him to the capital. He participated in Yuan Xiang's corruption trial in 504. Whenever Emperor Xuanwu visited Yuan Yong's mansion, Emperor Xuanwu would pay proper respect to him as an uncle, rather than allowing Yuan Yong to bow to him as a subject to an emperor.  During Emperor Xiaoming's reign  Emperor Xuanwu died suddenly in 515. The officials Yu Zhong and Cui Guang (Â¥îÂÖâ) quickly proclaimed Emperor Xuanwu's young crown prince Yuan Xu emperor (as Emperor Xiaoming) and seized power away from Emperor Xuanwu's wife Empress Gao, whose uncle Gao Zhao, who was also Emperor Xuanwu's uncle, was extremely powerful. In order to counteract Gao Zhao, Yu and Cui forced Empress Gao to yield regent powers to Yuan Yong and Emperor Xiaowen's cousin Yuan Cheng (ÂÖÉÊæÑ) the Prince of Rencheng, and then, Yu and Yuan Yong ambushed Gao Zhao and killed him. Empress Gao was also removed and replaced as empress dowager by Emperor Xiaoming's mother Consort Hu. Although Yuan Yong and Yuan Cheng were titular regents, real regency powers were in Yu's hands, and Yu quickly grew exceedingly arrogant and autocratic. The officials Pei Zhi (Ë£¥Ê§ç) and Guo Zuo (ÈÉ≠Á•ö) secretly suggested to Yuan Yong to have Yu's power stripped. When Yu found out about this, he falsely accused Pei and Guo of crimes, and they were put to death. Yu also wanted to kill Yuan Yong, but Cui resisted, so Yuan Yong was only removed from his posts. Later in 515, however, Empress Dowager Hu assumed regency powers and quickly stripped Yu of most of his posts, making Yu the governor of Ji Province. As soon as Yu left the capital, most of his acts were reversed, and Yuan Yong accused him of crimes and asked that he be punished. However, Empress Dowager Hu, because Yu had saved her life before, refused to act against Yu, although she recalled Yuan Yong back to the administration to serve in high capacity. During Empress Dowager Hu's regency, she tolerated officials' corruption and wealth- gathering, and often added to the wealth-gathering herself by awarding them money and luxuries out of the imperial treasury. Yuan Yong became exceedingly rich at this time, and historians described his wealth as being so great as like a nation's treasury, and he had 6,000 male servants and 500 female servants. While two other princes, Yuan Chen (ÂÖÉÁêõ) the Prince of Hejian and Yuan Rong (ÂÖÉËûç) the Prince of Zhangwu tried to compete with him, they could not, and it was commonly recognized that Yuan Yong was the richest official at the time. This type of corruption among high-level officials had a corrosive effect on Northern Wei's rule, and it was about this time that there began to be large-scale agrarian revolts throughout the empire. In 520, Empress Dowager Hu's brother-in-law, the general Yuan Cha, along with the eunuch Liu Teng (ÂäâÈ®∞) and the palace attendant Hou Gang (‰æØÂâõ), carried out a coup against her, putting her under house arrest. Yuan Cha, however, was respectful of Yuan Yong, and he remained in a position of power, although Yuan Cha was effectively the regent. In 525, Yuan Yong plotted with both Empress Dowager Hu and Emperor Xiaoming to restore Empress Dowager Hu, and later that year she seized power back from Yuan Cha and forced Yuan Cha to commit suicide. Yuan Yong, as one who participated in her plan, continued in his position of power.  Death  In 528, with Empress Dowager Hu and Emperor Xiaoming in a conflict after Emperor Xiaoming wanted to put Empress Dowager Hu's lover Zheng Yan (ÈÑ≠ÂÑº) to death by conspiring with the general Erzhu Rong, Empress Dowager Hu poisoned Emperor Xiaoming and put the young child Yuan Zhao, a great-grandson of Emperor Xiaowen from a collateral line, on the throne. Erzhu refused to recognize Yuan Zhao's imperial authority and advanced on Luoyang, quickly capturing it. He made Yuan Xie's son Yuan Ziyou emperor (as Emperor Xiaozhuang) and threw Empress Dowager Hu and Yuan Zhao into the Yellow River to drown. Erzhu then believed that, in order to show his might, he needed to massacre the high-level officials, whom the people viewed as corrupt. Under guise that they were needed to attend Emperor Xiaozhuang in sacrificing to heaven, he had them, led by Yuan Yong, report to Heyin, near Luoyang. Then, he had his cavalry surround them and massacre them. Erzhu would later regret this action, and he had Yuan Yong and the other officials killed buried with honor.

Possible inclusions (Portuguese colonies) are shaded light blue. Alternative planning in 1918, including the takeover of French colonies in Western and Central Africa Mittelafrika (, \\"Middle Africa\\") is the name created for a geostrategic region in central and east Africa. Much like Mitteleuropa, it articulated Germany's foreign policy aim, prior to World War I, of bringing the region under German domination. The difference being that Mittelafrika would presumably be an agglomeration of German colonies in Africa, while Mitteleuropa was conceptualised as a geostrategic buffer zone between Germany and Russia to be filled with puppet states. German strategic thinking was that if the region between the colonies of German East Africa (Rwanda, Burundi, and Tanganyika (Tanzania minus the island of Zanzibar)), German South-West Africa (Namibia minus Walvis Bay), and Kamerun (today's Republic of Cameroon) could be annexed, a contiguous entity could be created covering the breadth of the African continent from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. Given the richness in natural resources of the Congo Basin alone, this region would accrue considerable wealth to the colonising power through the exploitation of natural resources, as well as contributing to another German aim of economic self-sufficiency. The concept dates back to the 1890s, when the then Chancellor of Germany, Leo von Caprivi, gained the Caprivi Strip in the Heligoland‚ÄìZanzibar Treaty. This addition to German South-West Africa attached the colony to the Zambezi River. British and German imperialists competed over the region which now comprises Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi. Cecil Rhodes, on behalf of the British, successfully colonised the latter region (named Rhodesia, after Rhodes). Germany also discussed with Britain for them to press their ally, Portugal, to cede the colonies of Angola and Mozambique to them. The British however, had preferential trade agreements with Portugal, who was a trusted ally, and though plans for an eventual partition of the Portuguese colonies were drawn, Britain would thus see its colonial position in Africa severely weakened in case they were applied, since the Germans could then effectively threaten their Cairo-to-Cape lines of communication. These plans were arguably made to be used only as a last resort to appease Germany in case she threatened to disrupt the balance of power in Europe. However, since German foreign policy interests were in subsequent years mainly directed at gaining mastery in Europe itself, and not in Africa, they were eventually shelved. Indeed, as it is likely that German concepts of a \\"Mittelafrika\\" were designed to put pressure on Britain to tolerate growing German dominance in the European continent, and not the other way around, colonial concessions would never placate the German Empire, as surely British politicians came to realise at the time. Germany's aspirations in Mittelafrika were incorporated into Germany's aims in World War I insofar as Germany expected to be able to gain the Belgian Congo if it were to defeat Belgium in Europe. The full realisation of Mittelafrika depended on a German victory in World War I in the European theatre, where Britain would be forced to negotiate and cede its colonies in Rhodesia to Germany when faced with a German-dominated Europe across the English Channel. In the course of the actual war, German aspirations in Mittelafrika were never matched by events in the African theatre. The German colonies were at very different levels of defence and troop strength when the war began in Europe, and were not in a position to fight a war due to a lack of materiel.

It has no other important hormonal activity. Gestonorone caproate was discovered in 1960 and was introduced for medical use by 1973. It has been used widely throughout Europe, including in the United Kingdom, and has also been marketed in certain other countries such as Japan, China, and Mexico. However, it has since mostly been discontinued, and it remains available today only in a handful of countries, including the Czech Republic, Japan, Mexico, and Russia. Medical uses Gestonorone caproate is used in the palliative treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy and endometrial cancer. It is used at a dose of 100 to 200 mg once a week by intramuscular injection. Side effects Side effects of gestonorone caproate have been reported to include worsened glucose tolerance, decreased libido in men, and local injection site reactions such as irritation. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Gestonorone caproate is a potent, long-acting, and pure progestogen, possessing no androgenic, anabolic, antiandrogenic, estrogenic, antiestrogenic, glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, or teratogenic effects. It is approximately 20 to 25 times more potent than progesterone or hydroxyprogesterone caproate in animal bioassays when all are given by subcutaneous injection. In humans, 100 or 200 mg intramuscular gestonorone caproate has been said to be equivalent to 1,000 mg intramuscular hydroxyprogesterone caproate. Hence, gestonorone caproate is approximately 5- to 10-fold more potent than hydroxyprogesterone caproate in humans. The biological effects of gestonorone caproate in women have been studied. Like other potent progestins, gestonorone caproate possesses potent antigonadotropic activity and is capable of markedly suppressing the gonadal production and circulating levels of sex hormones such as testosterone and estradiol. A clinical study found that 400 mg/week intramuscular gestonorone caproate suppressed testosterone levels by 75% in men, while orchiectomy as a comparator reduced testosterone levels by 91%. Levels of luteinizing hormone, conversely, remained unchanged. In general, progestogens can maximally suppress testosterone levels by about 70 to 80%. In accordance with its lack of glucocorticoid activity, gestonorone caproate has no anticorticotropic effects, and does not influence the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone. 17Œ±-Hydroxyprogesterone has weak progestogenic activity, but C17Œ± esterification results in higher progestogenic activity. Of a variety of different esters, the caproate (hexanoate) ester was found to have the strongest progestogenic activity, and this formed the basis for the development of gestonorone caproate, as well as other caproate progestogen esters such as hydroxyprogesterone caproate. Gestonorone caproate has been found to decrease the weights of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles by 40 to 70% in adult male rats. It has been shown in canines to mediate these effects both via its antigonadotropic effects and by direct actions in these tissues. Gestonorone caproate decreases the uptake of testosterone into the prostate gland. It has also been found to have direct antiproliferative effects on human ovarian cancer cells in vitro. Gestonorone caproate has been reported to act to some extent as a 5Œ±-reductase inhibitor, similarly to progesterone. =Pharmacokinetics= Like the closely related progestins hydroxyprogesterone caproate and 19-norprogesterone, gestonorone caproate shows poor activity orally and must be administered parenterally; specifically, via intramuscular injection. Gestonorone caproate is administered by intramuscular injection, and acts as a long-lasting depot by this route. After an intramuscular injection, gestonorone caproate is completely released from the local depot and is highly bioavailable. A single intramuscular injection of 25 to 50 mg gestonorone caproate in oil solution has been found to have a duration of action of 8 to 13 days in terms of clinical biological effect in the uterus in women. At high doses, the duration of action of gestonorone caproate by intramuscular injection has been found to be at least 21 days. Clinical studies have found gestonorone caproate to be satisfactorily effective as a progestogen when injected once a month, whereas it was poorly effective as an injectable contraceptive when it was injected once every two months. Following a single intramuscular injection of 200 mg radiolabeled gestonorone caproate in 1 mL of solution in men with prostate cancer, maximal levels of gestonorone caproate occurred after 3 ¬± 1 days and were 420 ¬± 160 ng/mL. The elimination half-life of gestonorone caproate and its metabolites was 7.5 ¬± 3.1 days. Approximately 5% of the radioactive steroid content in the blood was unchanged gestonorone caproate. No free gestonorone was observed in circulation or in urine. Gestonorone caproate and its metabolites were eliminated 72% in feces and 28% in urine. Approximately 48 ¬± 18% of the injected dose had been eliminated after 14 days and approximately 85 ¬± 12% of the injected dose had been excreted after 30 days. The metabolism of unesterified gestonorone (17Œ±-hydroxy-19-norprogesterone) is analogous to that of 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone, with the corresponding 19-norpregnane metabolites produced. Gestonorone caproate has been found to undergo 5Œ±-reduction similarly to progesterone, 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone, and gestonorone, and at a similar rate as these steroids. Conversely however, due to its caproate ester, 5Œ≤-reduction of gestonorone caproate is decreased relative to these steroids. As progesterone is metabolized mainly into 5Œ≤-pregnanes, decreased 5Œ≤-reduction of gestonorone caproate may be involved in its greater potency compared to progesterone. The major metabolites of gestonorone caproate have been reported to be isomers of 19-norpregnanetriol and 19-norpregnanediol-20-one. These metabolites indicate that gestonorone caproate is metabolized mainly by reduction at the C3, C5, and C20 positions. Following an intramuscular injection of 300 mg gestonorone caproate, only a slight increase in urinary pregnanetriol excretion has been observed. Cleavage of the caproate ester of gestonorone caproate is minimal, which indicates that it is not a prodrug of the unesterified steroid. Chemistry Gestonorone caproate, also known as norhydroxyprogesterone caproate, 17Œ±-hydroxy-19-norprogesterone 17Œ±-hexanoate, or 17Œ±-hydroxy-19-norpregn-4-ene-3,20-dione 17Œ±-hexanoate, is a synthetic norpregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a combined derivative of 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone and 19-norprogesterone, or of gestronol (17Œ±-hydroxy-19-norprogesterone), with a hexanoate (caproate) ester at the C17Œ± position. Analogues and derivatives of gestonorone caproate include algestone acetophenide (dihydroxyprogesterone acetophenide), demegestone, nomegestrol acetate, norgestomet, and segesterone acetate, as well as 18-methylsegesterone acetate and the caproate esters chlormadinone caproate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone caproate, megestrol caproate, and methenmadinone caproate. =Synthesis= Chemical syntheses of gestonorone caproate have been published. History Gestonorone caproate was first described in 1960. It was developed by Schering and has been marketed since at least 1968.Schering, A. G. (1968). Depostat (SH 582): A New Treatment for Prostatic Hypertrophy. https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=13658296147916476056 Society and culture =Generic names= Gestonorone caproate is the generic name of the drug and its , , and , while gestronol hexanoate is its . It has also been referred to as norhydroxyprogesterone caproate, and is also known by its former developmental code names SH-582 and SH-80582. =Brand names= Gestonorone caproate has been marketed exclusively under the brand names Depostat and Primostat. =Availability= Availability of gestonorone caproate in countries throughout the world as of March 2018. Blue is currently marketed, green is formerly marketed. Gestonorone caproate has been available widely in Europe, including in the United Kingdom, and has also been marketed in Japan, China, Mexico, and certain other countries.https://www.drugs.com/international/gestonorone- caproate.htmlhttp://www.micromedexsolutions.com/micromedex2/librarian/ However, it has been discontinued in most countries and its availability is more limited today; it appears to remain marketed only in the Czech Republic, Japan, Mexico, and Russia.http://www.mhra.gov.uk/spc-pil/ It has not been marketed in the United States, Canada, and many other countries. Research Gestonorone caproate was studied in the treatment of prostate cancer in men at a dosage of 400 mg per week by intramuscular injection but, in contrast to the case of benign prostatic hyperplasia, was found to be ineffective. SH-834 was a combination of 90 mg estradiol valerate and 300 mg gestonorone caproate for weekly intramuscular injection that was developed by Schering in the 1960s and 1970s. It was investigated clinically as a treatment for breast cancer and was found to be effective. However, its effectiveness was found to be no better than that of an estrogen alone, and the combination was ultimately never marketed. Gestonorone caproate was studied by Schering for use as a progestogen-only injectable contraceptive across a dose range of 2.5 to 200 mg once every one or two months but was never marketed.Rodriguez-Restrepo, R. (1969). 17-alpha-hydroxy 19 norprogesterone capronate as a prolonged-action injectable contraceptive agent. Revista Colombiana de Obstetricia y Ginecologia, 20, 247-255. https://www.popline.org/node/479231 There is very little clinical experience of gestonorone caproate for this indication. Gestonorone caproate has been studied in the treatment of ovarian cancer (in combination with cyclophosphamide), menstrual cycle-related mouth ulcers, and as a component of menopausal hormone therapy.

St. Ursula's motto is \\"Soli Deo Gloria\\" meaning \\"For the Glory of God alone\\". History In December 1854, four Ursuline nuns arrived in Toledo, Ohio. Several days after their arrival from nearby Cleveland, Ohio, they began to operate classes on Cherry Street in downtown Toledo. These classes were offered roughly two hundred students, ranging in grade level. The nuns moved into a property located on Cherry and Erie streets in 1859.Ursuline Center: History The early curriculum consisted of courses in English, German, French, history, art, music, natural sciences, mathematics, cooking, and sewing. There were two primary departments in the school: elementary and collegiate. In 1905, the school relocated to Collingwood Boulevard to a recently purchased facility that included a new convent and academy. As the school began to expand and Mary Manse College opened in 1922, the Ursulines decided to move to a new location on Indian Road. The new building opened for the first time for classes in 1959. Renovations in 2000 included the addition of the Mary Ann LaValley Activities Center, which added four new classrooms, athletic offices, a field house, fitness center and a dance studio.SUA School History Academics SUA operates on the collegiate block schedule (also referred to as the 4x4 block). Students take four 80-minute classes in each semester and rotate most classes at the end of the first semester. Exceptions to this are extended AP courses or 9-week, \\"term-long\\" classes. In the middle of the day, students also have a \\"seminar\\" period in which they can work on homework, seek assistance from teachers, and collaborate on group projects. Core courses provide a student with 23 academic credits for graduation, out of 31.5 units of academic credit required: English (4.5 units), Math (4 units), Social Studies (3 units), Science (3 units), Foreign Language (2 units), Theology (4 units), Computer Application (.5 unit), Health (.5 unit), Fine Art (1 unit), Physical Education (.5 unit), and Personal Finance (.5 credit). Eighteen of these classes are offered in honors, such as English, American Literature, Pre-Calculus, Algebra, Geometry, Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Anatomy & Physiology, World History, French, German, Satellite Remote Sensing, Spanish, Vocal Music, and Instrumental Music. Sixteen classes are offered at an AP level as well, including Calculus, Chemistry, English Literature, Human Geography, Psychology, Statistics, Latin, US Government, and US History. A 5.0 GPA is achievable by getting A's in honors classes. SUA also offers many elective courses, including Engineering, Film, Speech, Science and Literature, Economics, Geoscience, Computer Web Page Design, Single Survival Life Skills, Psychology, Women's Health, and Minority Voices. Student life =Campus Ministry= Campus Ministry focuses on spiritual growth and sponsors Lenten Projects, supports Catholic Heartwork mission trips, and plans annual class retreats, including Kairos. Campus Ministry encourages students to reach out by volunteering and helps them to earn 60 hours of volunteer credit required for graduation.SUA: Christian Service Program In 2006, SUA students volunteered more than 11,000 hours working in nursing homes, tutoring underprivileged children, and assisting with disaster relief. =Athletics= St. Ursula has summer camps, a personal trainer, and a brand new fitness room to support its fifteen varsity sports, including basketball, bowling, crew, cross country, dance, diving, golf, gymnastics, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track, and volleyball. SUA had been a member of the Toledo City League for all athletic competition until joining the Three Rivers Athletic Conference in 2011. SUA also has many club sports, such as broomball, equestrian, fencing, and sailing teams.

Formed in 1981, they play their home matches at the Merkland Playing Fields and their colours are red with yellow and navy trim. Upon their formation in 1981 the club competed initially in a local Sunday football league, before transferring to Saturday football in the Stirling and District League in 1982. They won promotion in three consecutive seasons so that by the 1985-86 season they were in the First Division, which they won at the first time of asking. By 1989 they had switched from the Stirling and District League to the Central Scottish Amateur Football League, in which they still compete today. In 1998 they won the Premier Division of the Central Scottish League for the first time, and have also won it on another four occasions, in 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2015. In 2002 they won the Scottish Amateur Cup at Hampden Park when they defeated Dumbarton Academy Former Pupils 4-2 in the final. They retained the trophy the following year, beating Newmilns Vesuvius 1-0 in the final, again at Hampden Park. In 2015, Harestanes won the Scottish Amateur Cup for a third time, which under new rules introduced that year meant they became the first ever winners of the trophy to qualify for the senior Scottish Cup. They made their Scottish Cup debut in a preliminary round tie in August 2015, losing 3‚Äì0 to Girvan. The match was a home tie for Harestanes, but with Merklands being deemed unsuitable, it was played at Duncansfield Park, Kilsyth, in front of three hundred spectators.

The story is based on the Not Quite Human book series by Seth McEvoy. It is the first of three films in a series; its sequels are Not Quite Human II (1989) and Still Not Quite Human (1992). The filming locations were in Scottsdale and Phoenix, Arizona. Plot Dr. Jonas Carson (Alan Thicke) creates an android that looks just like a human teenage boy, and he \\"adopts\\" him as his son and as an older brother to Becky (Robyn Lively), who names him Chip. After the Carsons move to a new town, Chip (Jay Underwood) is enrolled in high school alongside Becky. Dr. Carson also goes to the high school, having filled a vacancy as a science teacher, which allows him close range to see how Chip interacts with others. Chip's ways seem to have an annoying or amusing effect on students and teachers, depending on how it is viewed. Chip runs afoul of Coach Duckworth and strict teachers, but his literalist actions surprisingly make him some friends, as other teenagers see it as a way that he is bucking the system. Chip also gains the attention of Erin (Kristy Swanson), a fellow student. However, Dr. Carson and Chip are being stalked by Gordon Vogel (Joseph Bologna), a former employer who is a defense contractor. A former colleague of Carson's, J.J. Derks, is enlisted to seek out Carson. When asked about Carson's son, Derks says Carson only has a daughter until he remembers that Carson in his younger years had confided in some friends about his idea to make a realistic android, which Derks and the others originally dismissed. Vogel tells Derks they will capture Chip, as Carson had failed to oblige an earlier contract. Since Chip was built with Vogel's resources and while Carson was supposed to honor the contract, Vogel claims he is entitled to ownership of Chip. When Derks questions what Vogel wants with Chip, Vogel replies he intends to reprogram Chip for military purposes. Chip must shake his pursuers while trying to present a \\"normal\\" life like a human. Cast *Jay Underwood ... Chip Carson *Alan Thicke ... Dr. Jonas Carson *Robyn Lively ...

It was released by Candlelight Records originally in 2005. Background Gallows Gallery is Sigh's first album as a four-piece rather than a trio and their first album for which they made a music video. The album also more prominently features clean vocals, with Mirai's singing heavily processed through Pro Tools and vocoders. Sigh incorporated influences that prompted Avi Pitchon to describe the album in Terrorizer as containing a \\"decidedly power fuckin' metal vibe...it's power metal the Sigh way\\". Pitchon went on to suggest that \\"one thing Gallows Gallery surely isn't is black metal\\". In response to suggestions that Gallows Gallery and the preceding Imaginary Sonicscape sounded more \\"happy\\" than previous Sigh albums, Mirai responded that: Mirai also confirmed that, while the album is not a concept album, \\"musically each song is connected with the same or similar chord progressions and melodies\\", producing what he described as \\"a certain continuity\\". The untitled Track 10 was purported to be a recording of sounds researched in sonic warfare, created to psychologically harm the listener. It was also rumored that the inclusion of this track was what caused the band to be dropped from the Century Media label; however, both of these rumors have been refuted by the band. These rumors were created in part to hide the poor mastering of the original release, and in part to hide the real reason why they were dropped from Century Media, which was that the label was disappointed that the band did not go in a more black metal-oriented direction. In 2007, The End Records released a remastered reissue of the album, with revamped blue-sky artwork and extra tracks. The minute-long intro to \\"Confession to Be Buried\\" was removed from the remastered version, bringing the track's length down to 5:25.

In the 1930s, the MTA began to feel the effects of the Great Depression and eventually ceased operations. However, a single chapter remains, in Barbados. Various businesses rented the former Mosaic Templars building into the late 20th century, but changing business climates, urban renewal, and the construction of a nearby highway through the old business district left the building without occupants and in disrepair. In 1992, the building was slated for demolition so that a fast-food restaurant could be built on the lot.Finley, Randy. From Slavery to Uncertain Freedom: The Freedman's Bureau in Arkansas 1865-1869. Fayetteville, Ark.: University of Arkansas Press, 1996, p. xlix. On January 19, 1993, the Society for the Preservation of the Mosaic Templars of America Building, a group of urban preservationists, was incorporated to lobby against the building's destruction. The city of Little Rock purchased the building for $110,000 in late 1993, marking the first time the city purchased a building for historic preservation.Finley, p. l. The structure burned to the ground on March 12, 2005. City voters passed a $185,000 1993 bond initiative to purchase additional property lots around the building, and planning began for an African American culture and history museum on the site. In 2001, the Society won passage of two laws in the Arkansas state legislature. The first law provided money to fund the creation of the museum, and the second turned the museum over to the Department of Arkansas Heritage, a state agency.Finley, p. li-lii. A new building was constructed on the site, and the Mosaic Templars Cultural Center was turned over to the state.Davis, p. 40.

It has a red forehead; greyish head, back and breast; and yellow belly patch and undertail coverts. The female lays a single white egg. The chick and egg are tended to by both parents. Its diet consists mainly of fruits. Culturally, the Mariana fruit dove is a very important symbol of the region. This species is the official bird of the Northern Marianas Islands.. In 2005, the Mariana fruit dove was originally chosen as the official mascot of the 2006 Micronesian Games in Saipan. However, the official website for the games shows a tropicbird as the official symbol instead of the Mariana fruit dove. At San Diego Zoo The species faces extinction due to habitat loss throughout its range. A larger threat to the Mariana fruit dove has been the accidental introduction of the Brown tree snake to Guam during World War II. The snakes decimated the native bird populations of the island, which were unaccustomed to predators. They are extinct on Guam since 1984 and the Mariana fruit dove is highly endangered on other islands in its range. The spread of the snakes to the Northern Marianas Islands could be devastating. Several zoos have started captive breeding programs. The St. Louis Zoo, in St. Louis, Missouri, has one of the most successful captive breeding programs. The program began in 1993. Due to ongoing habitat loss, limited range, small population size and invasive alien species, the Mariana fruit dove is evaluated as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

In 1843 Fleury-Husson moved to Paris. He met Charles Baudelaire and the next year started writing art criticism under the pen-name \\"Champfleury\\" for the journal L'Artiste. He was one of the first to promote the work of Gustave Courbet, in an article appearing in an issue of Le Pamphlet in 1848. In 1850, during a time when the Spanish school was still largely ignored, he advocated the work of El Greco. He wrote about the Le Nain brothersChampfleury, Nouvelles r√©ch√©rches sur la vie et l'oeuvre des fr√®res Le Nain, 1862. and Maurice Quentin de La Tour. He also had a brief affair in 1851 with Eveline Ha≈Ñska, the widow of his friend Honor√© de Balzac.Robb, Graham. Balzac: A Biography. New York: W. W. Norton &x; Company, 1994. . p. 414. He edited the periodical Le r√©alisme in 1856 and 1857. His novels, of which the best-known is Les bourgeois de Molinchart (1854), were among the earliest Realist works. In 1869 his book Les Chats, a series of essays about cats including portrayals of cats by prominent artists of the time, was published by Librairie de la Soci√©t√© Botanique de France, edited by J.

History Cricket may not have reached Lancashire until the 18th century. The earliest known reference to cricket being played in the county is in 1781.Bowen, p. 266. In 1816, Manchester Cricket Club was founded and soon became the most important side within the county in the same way that Sheffield Cricket Club and Nottingham Cricket Club were in Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. Manchester played mostly against opponents from the north of England and 13 of its matches between 1844 and 1858 have first-class status. Four other first-class matches were played between 1849 and 1851 between Lancashire XIs and Yorkshire XIs. In their early years, the club played their cricket at the Crescent in Salford and afterwards at Moss Lane (here a match against an All England was played in the 1840s; it is said that an XI who played a match at Lord's in 1842 were defeated because they bowled underarm)Bruton, F.

In 1856, Sir Humphrey de Trafford identified this land as being an ideal location for the planned Manchester Art and Treasures Exhibition and offered Manchester Cricket Club ¬£500 in compensation for the remainder of their lease. The club, however, insisted on a figure of ¬£1,000 and agreed to vacate the site ahead of the 1857 season, moving to the ground which subsequently became Old Trafford Cricket Ground, the home of Lancashire cricket. Lancashire County Cricket Club was formally constituted on 12 January 1864 at a meeting of thirteen Lancashire cricket clubs in Manchester. In 1865, the new club joined the County Championship and played its initial important match against Middlesex at Old Trafford on 20, 21 and 22 July.

She is best known for her role as Elphaba in the Chicago production of Wicked. She was previously in the casts of Princess Ida and the off-Broadway production Boobs! The Musical. In 2016, she portrayed Ms. Bassett in Finding Neverland on Broadway and understudied the role of Madame du Maurier. She was last seen on Broadway as the role of Grandma Josephine in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  Early life  Cates started her performing career at 3 years old, singing songs and presenting self-written musicals at home. In the second grade, her talents were recognized by the director of her grammar school musical who heard Cates \\"crowing\\" at the roosters who took up residence next to the playground. She was immediately cast as the singing rooster in the Christmas pageant. Cates attended Justin- Siena High School in Napa, California. She performed in community theater productions around her native Northern California, spending 7 years with the Pinole Young Actors group. At age 17, she was cast in her first professional production and made the decision to pursue a career in theater.

In 2018, she released a jazzy, musical theatre song called \\"Kristy's Lament (Another Awful Day With the MTA).\\" After leaving her Broadway show one evening, she had took to Facebook to recount her disastrous subway ride home. The post went viral, and caught the attention of lyricist Chris Giordano, who adapted Kristy's commute into a musical number, with composer Ryan Edward Wise. =Wicked= Cates was cast in the musical Wicked as an ensemble member and understudy for the role of Elphaba, which was played by Idina Menzel. The show opened October 30, 2003. She can be heard on the Original Broadway Cast (OBC) recording of the show. As a member of the cast, she performed on the 2004 Tony Awards, Late Show with David Letterman, and at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. In March 2005, when Stephanie J.

The school is organized into a preschool, elementary school (grades K-5), a middle school (grades 6-8) and a high school (grades 9-12). It is a member of Christian Schools International and is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. History In 1907, a group of fathers from the Christian Reformed Church of Whitinsville organized a Society for Christian Instruction. It was their desire and purpose to educate their children in a school where the Scripture was central to all of learning. In 1924, the Society was incorporated by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as an educational institution. Classes began in 1928 in the basement of the Christian Reformed Church on Willow Street in Whitinsville. In 1966, a 28-acre (11 hectares) site was purchased from the Whitin Machine Works, and on March 30, 1968, ground was broken for a new school building, which was completed in November, 1969. The recent Rise Up and Build Campaign has raised $18 million and has inspired the building of a new Athletic Field House and Performing Arts Center scheduled to open in August 2017. The school, located at 279 Linwood Avenue in Whitinsville, Massachusetts, serves about 600 students with about 70 faculty and staff. Music WCS has an orchestra program for students in grades pre-K-12. The students are taught using the Suzuki Method. Over 125 students participate in the WCS strings program. Every two years the most advanced members of the orchestra go on a tour to play their instruments and interact with the people in that area. Many trips are to places in the U.S., although past trips have included the Dominican Republic in 2005 and England in 1998. The most recent trip in the spring of 2011 was to Gary, West Virginia. Many middle and high school students audition for the Central District orchestra, which is composed of musicians from the Central Massachusetts area. The high school orchestra is directed by Sylvia Thayer, while the chamber orchestras is directed by Monica Vanderbaan, and middle school orchestra is directed by Tammy Kaye. WCS also has high school and middle school bands which play regularly. The bands perform two major concerts during the course of the year: the Christmas Concert and Band Finale. Recently, the HS Band was commended by Bethesda Game Studios for its original arrangement and performance of the main theme from the video game Skyrim. WCS's Choral program has also gained acclaim in recent years. In the last 4 years, over a dozen students have been selected to the Central Districts Chorus. In 2012, two vocalists were selected to the prestigious Massachusetts All-State Chorus. The WCS HS Choir also embarks on a biennial tour of the Eastern United States in April and has recently performed concerts tour in Washington, D.C., Maryland, New Jersey, Philadelphia and New York City. They have sung at the Lincoln Memorial, Independence Hall and other notable venues across the East. For high school students who want a more prestigious vocal experience, WCS has the singing group \\"Encore\\", a by-audition vocal ensemble which rehearses several times per week and performs a variety of different music genres such as musical theater, pop, rock, gospel and jazz. Almost all of Encore's music is specifically arranged for the groupEncore's website. http://www.whitinsvillechristian.org/encore/ and they engage in a number of performances throughout New England each year sharing their music. Sports Whitinsville Christian School belongs to the Dual Valley Conference, along with Blackstone-Millville, Douglas, Hopedale, Nipmuc, and Sutton. =Facilities= The school's sports facilities are in the process of being updated in our major building project due to be completed in August 2017. At the end of the 2005-06 school year a track was completed. It circles the varsity soccer field that was added the year before. In 2005, a softball field was built in the memory of Karen Taylor. The school also has six tennis courts that were built in memory of Kaitlin Sperry Koopman. Whitinsville Christian School also has a gym, a cross country course, and a junior varsity soccer field. =Fall Sports= The boys cross country team is coached by Chris Vanderbaan, while the girls team is coached by elite runner Ann MacKay.

He has been a member of the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) since 1984, and is a member of the PBA and USBC Halls of Fame. He currently ranks fifth all-time with 35 career PBA Tour titles, and has earned over $3.1 million in PBA events ‚Äî only the fourth PBA player to top the $3 million mark. Bohn also won the $150,000 winner-take-all prize in the 2008 Motel 6 Roll to Riches event, but the earnings in this event did not count toward PBA career totals. Through the 2018 season, he has thrown 114 career perfect 300 games in PBA competition, including the 13th PBA nationally televised 300 game at the 1998 ABC Masters in Reno, Nevada. PBA Tour Bohn's best career stretch was from 1997 through 2001‚Äì02, during which he won 18 titles overall and at least one title each season. His best single season came in 1999, when he won five titles and earned PBA Player of the Year honors. The '99 season featured a streak in which Parker won eight consecutive televised matches. His 1999 single-season average of 228.03 ranks fourth all- time. He would also be named Player of the Year in the 2001‚Äì02 season, a year highlighted by a major championship title at the 2001 ABC Masters. Bohn won his second major tournament at age 49 by winning the PBA World Championship in January 2013. He joined the PBA50 Tour (formerly PBA Senior Tour) in 2014, and has four titles on that Tour, while continuing to bowl on the standard PBA Tour. Bohn also owns 25 PBA Regional Tour titles and three PBA50 Regional Tour titles. The 52-year-old Bohn won his 35th PBA Tour title at the PBA Cheetah Championship in December 2015, topping England's Paul Moor in the final match, 210‚Äì206. The win broke the career titles tie Bohn held with Mark Roth, moving him alone into fifth-place all time. Coupled with Bohn's win at the PBA Players Championship earlier in the year, 2015 marked the first time he won multiple titles in a season since 2001‚Äì02. His win was a breakthrough as he had finished runner-up at the Players Championship in 1993, 1996, 1998, and 1999. Bohn was retroactively awarded a major title for his 2015 PBA Players Championship victory. After the tournament returned to major status in the 2016 season, the PBA voted to award additional major titles to the winners of the three previous Players Championship events (2011, 2013, 2015), stating the tournament \\"is a members-only event, and includes all of the elements of a major.\\" This gave Bohn three majors among his 35 PBA Tour titles. Bohn is a four-time winner of the PBA's Steve Nagy Sportsmanship award. Highly active in promoting youth bowling, Bohn has established an annual Parker Bohn III Youth Scholarship Tournament in Howell, New Jersey. The tournament, which awards junior bowlers with college scholarship funding, is in its 21st year as of 2020. Parker won the PBA's very first Tony Reyes Community Service Award for the 2012‚Äì13 season. Additional titles and accomplishments In addition to his PBA Tour titles, Bohn III has won 25 PBA Regional titles, plus two European Bowling Tour (EBT) titles that were not considered PBA titles: the 2013 BNC Bratislava Open and the 2016 Brunswick Ballmaster Open, held in Helsinki, Finland. Since joining the PBA50 Tour in 2014, Bohn has won four PBA50 titles. Bohn holds the PBA record for the highest pinfall in a 56-game qualifying block, both scratch (13,540) and with bonus pins (13,990). He also holds the scratch (14,924) and with bonus pins (15,479) records for a 64-game block. Both records were set in the 1999 season. Personal life Bohn was born in Jackson Township, New Jersey. He currently lives in New Jersey with his wife, Leslie (Beamish), and three children, Justin, Brandon, and Sydney. He has two adult sons, Parker IV and Evan, from his first marriage. He is the brother-in-law of fellow PBA Hall of Famer, Doug Kent (Doug's wife Chrissie and Parker's wife Leslie are sisters). Parker Bohn (the first), PBIII's grandfather, was a five-time stock car (Modifieds and Sportsmen) racing champion at Wall (NJ) Stadium near his home at the Jersey Shore. His uncle (his mother's brother, Vincent Manniello) was a member of Bruce Springsteen's early band the Castiles. In the media Besides making regular appearances on ABC-TV, CBS-TV and ESPN during his years on the PBA tour, Bohn has authored a book (with text by Dan Herbst) called Bowling: How to Master the Game (Universe Publishing). A bowling arcade game also bears his name: Parker Bohn III Pro Bowler. The full-motion video game features audio voice-over by Parker himself. Bohn appeared in the movie Kingpin with Woody Harrelson for a brief scene. He also appeared as Frank Cache in episode 10 of the Japanese television drama Golden Bowl, bowling against Shu Akutagawa (played by Takeshi Kaneshiro.) During one part of the episode, Bohn bowls right-handed (his opposite hand), deliberately throwing the game to show his disdain for his opponent. Bohn has also appeared in a television commercial for Lumber Liquidators, where he is shown attempting to throw a bowling ball on new hardwood floors only to be stopped by his wife, Leslie. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBLckDn030o He is one of the professional opponents in the \\"PBA¬Æ Bowling Challenge\\" game for Android and iOS devices.

Port Leon is classified as an \\"extinct city\\" by the State Library and Archives of Florida and only remnants can be found today. Port Leon, established in 1837, in large measure by former inhabitants of Magnolia, was located about south of St. Marks on the east bank of the St. Marks River. It, like neighboring St. Marks and Magnolia, was an important port for the cotton plantations of the Red Hills Region of Florida and Georgia. The Tallahassee Railroad reached Port Leon in 1839. Florida Dept. of Transportation: Rail history By then freight wagons and the railroad were bringing some 30,000 to 40,000 bales of cotton a year into the area ports. A bridge across the St. Marks River tied the port to the railroad and the docks for loading on ships, bound for the east coast of the United States. Port Leon received a post office in 1840,Gallagher, John S. (1997) Florida Post Offices, p. 187 Lake Grove, Oregon: The Depot and was incorporated in 1841. In the same year Port Leon, along with the other communities in the area, endured a severe yellow fever epidemic. On March 11, 1843, it was chosen as the seat of newly created Wakulla County. On September 13, 1843, a strong hurricane with a 10-foot (3 m) storm surge hit the area and destroyed Port Leon as well as heavily damaging nearby Magnolia and St. Marks. Port Leon was abandoned and many of its residents moved inland to the new town of Newport.Historical markers of Florida - Port Leon - accessed February 9, 2008.

Born in Saint Joseph, Missouri, he conducted path-breaking research on land economics, developed an influential approach to the analysis of neighborhoods and housing markets, refined local area economic analysis, and was a major figure in the development of suburban shopping centers in the decades after World War II. His sector model of land use remains one of his most well-known contributions to urban scholarship. Hoyt attended the University of Kansas from which he graduated at the age of 18 with a Phi Beta Kappa key. He also earned a J.D. in 1918 and a Ph.D. in economics in 1933, both from the University of Chicago. Between 1918 and 1933, he taught economics, business law, and accounting at various colleges. His dissertation, One Hundred Years of Land Values in Chicago, led to numerous opportunities to work as a real estate consultant. In 1934, he joined the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) as Principal Housing Economist and later taught as a visiting professor at MIT and Columbia University before opening a consulting firm in 1946. He maintained an active practice consulting on real estate development (with a specialization in suburban shopping malls) and economic analysis. Hoyt also invested in real estate, out of which came the money to establish the Homer Hoyt Institute. Hoyt made significant contributions in five areas. First, he developed a novel approach to the historical analysis of land values that utilized primary data and mapping techniques. Second, he applied this methodology during his time at the FHA to assessing the viability of neighborhoods and designing strategies for intervention. His approach combined multiple factors (e.g., condition of dwelling, transportation access, proportion of non-whites) using overlay mapping. The approach enabled the FHA to assess the risk a neighborhood posed for mortgage lenders. The methodology was also used by the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) to produce Residential Security maps to determine the risks associated with the mortgages it had made previously. At the time, mixed race neighborhoods were considered unstable and the corresponding attitude towards lending came to be known as red-lining because of the color used on the maps to designate a high-risk neighborhood. Out of this work emerged the sector theory that replaced Ernest Burgess's concentric zone theory of urban morphology. Third, Hoyt refined the method of economic base analysis that enabled municipal and state governments to assess potential population growth based on the mix of basic and non-basic employment within their economies. Fourth, Hoyt's ability to analyze profitable locations for shopping centers and to estimate their likely revenues made him the country's premier consultant on these matters. Lastly, Hoyt wrote frequently on urban development from a comparative perspective, producing some of the earliest writings in this vein. Hoyt was not only a consultant but an active contributor to the profession of real estate appraising and to land economics and real estate analysis. The textbook, Principles of Real Estate co-authored with Arthur Weimer, went through seven editions and he published in a variety of professional and academic journals. His legacy continues with the Homer Hoyt Institute that supports real estate research, provides advanced studies for Weimer School fellows, and works to support careers in real estate. The Homer Hoyt Institute Hoyt, in addition to his theories, had a great interest in research produced by academia. His desire was to bring academia and industry together for the enrichment of both. Towards this end, Hoyt decided to underwrite the formation of the Homer Hoyt Institute in 1967. Income from the sale of his Florida property was used to support research at the American University as part of a consortium of 35 universities. It was later shifted to the creation of an advanced studies institute named in honor of Dean Arthur M. Weimer (1910‚Äì1987), Hoyt‚Äôs closest friend and co-author of a longstanding leading textbook in real estate. By January 2009, the Institute had admitted over 120 candidates who are national and international leaders in academic and industry research in real estate and related areas to the status of Weimer School Fellows. The Advanced Studies Institute, which oversees the Weimer School, was renamed the Maury Seldin Advanced Studies Institute in Real Estate and Land Economics when Dr. Seldin, the founding president of the Homer Hoyt Institute, retired after twenty-five years of service. A division of the Homer Hoyt Institute is known as the Hoyt Fellows. It is the industry counterpart of the Weimer School Fellows. The Institute has also formed the Hoyt Institute for Real Estate, which is oriented to those seeking a career in this field. More information on these Hoyt Group activities is available on the Hoyt Group website: Influence on redlining In 1933, Hoyt published a list of racial groups and ranked them from positive to negative influence on property values: 1\\\\. English, Scotch, Irish, Scandinavians. 2\\\\. North Italians. 3\\\\. Bohemians or Czechs. 4\\\\. Poles. 5\\\\. Lithuanians. 6\\\\. Greeks. 7\\\\. Russians, Jews (lower class). 8\\\\.

Photo of Tsun Jin High School (), a Chinese independent high school in Kuala Lumpur. Visible on the building's walls are the names of donors who funded its construction. Naming a building after major donors is a common practice among Independent Chinese High Schools A Chinese independent high school () is a type of private high school in Malaysia. They provide secondary education in the Chinese language as the continuation of the primary education in Chinese national-type primary schools. The language of instruction in these schools is Mandarin Chinese using simplified Chinese characters. There are 61 Chinese independent high schools in the country, including 23 from East Malaysia, and they represent a small number of the high schools in Malaysia. The United Chinese School Committees Association of Malaysia (UCSCAM, the association of Chinese school teachers and trustees, ), also known as the Dong Jiao Zong (), coordinates the curriculum used in the schools and organises the Unified Examination Certificate (UEC) standardised test. Despite this, the schools are independent of each other and are free to manage their own affairs. Being private schools under the recent budget for 2020, Chinese independent high schools receive funding from the Malaysian government. However, in accordance with their aim of providing affordable education to all in the Chinese language, their school fees are substantially lower than those of most other private schools. The schools are kept alive almost exclusively by donations from the public. History Chinese schools were being founded by the ethnic Chinese in Malaya as early as the 19th century. The schools were set up with the main intention of providing education in the Chinese language. As such, their students remain largely Chinese to this day even though the school themselves are open to people of all races and backgrounds. After Malaya's independence in 1957, the government instructed all schools to surrender their properties and be assimilated into the National School system. This caused an uproar among the Chinese and a compromise was achieved in that the schools would instead become \\"National Type\\" schools. Under such a system, the government is only in charge of the school curriculum and teaching personnel while the lands still belonged to the schools. While Chinese primary schools were allowed to retain Chinese as the medium of instruction, Chinese secondary schools are required to change into English-medium schools. Over 60 schools converted to become National Type schools, including famous schools like Chung Ling High School, Penang Chinese Girls' High School on Penang Island, Jit Sin High School, and Ave Maria Convent High School, Sam Tet High School. While the medium language for most subjects is switched to English as according to the proposal, the teaching and learning of Mandarin remained compulsory in these schools, with most of them dedicating at least one seventh to one fifth of their teaching time per week to Mandarin studies. This plan was still viewed as an unacceptable compromise amongst some Chinese, and a minority of the Chinese schools refused the proposal and became private high schools or Chinese independent high schools as they were later called. This concept slowly gained popularity and, during the 1960s and 70s, many of the National Type high schools reopened their independent high school branch. Their numbers continued to grow until a period when the political situation in Malaysia made it impossible to set up additional independent Chinese high schools. Currently there are 60 independent Chinese high schools in Malaysia, including Foon Yew High School which is the largest secondary school in the country with over 10000 students. Foon Yew High School was the first school to refuse the government's proposal, as well as the first high school to have 2 branch campus (located in Kulai and Pasir Gudang). The second largest is Chong Hwa Independent High School, Kuala Lumpur, which is known for its excellent academic performance as well as award-winning performance in inter-school competitions. =Chinese Independent High Schools in East Malaysia= In 1960, there were 18 high schools using Chinese as the medium of teaching and 22 high schools teaching in the English medium in Sarawak alone. In the year, the British Crown Colony who were then in control of Sarawak proposed that the 18 high schools using Chinese as the medium of teaching be converted into using English. In 1961, a letter was sent to all of the Chinese-medium high schools demanding them to convert teaching of all subjects into English before 1 April 1962. Failing to do so, the schools would not be given any allocations from the government. Despite strong rejection by the local Chinese community, the plan still took place. In the end, six high schools out of the 18 refused to convert to teaching in English; they were the Chung Hua Middle School No.1, Chung Hua Middle School No.3, Chung Hua Middle School No.4, Guong Ming Middle School, Kiang Hin Middle School and Kai Dee Middle School. The rest of the school which converted into English medium schools ended up as \\"Sekolah Kebangsaan\\" after Sarawak joined Malaysia. In 1983 these English medium schools were once again converted into using Bahasa Malaysia as the medium of teaching. The Chinese community not only continued to support the six high schools which retained the teaching in Chinese (founded in between 1945 and 1960), they had even founded another eight high schools between 1962 and 1968. These 14 high schools then became a part of Malaysia's Chinese independent high school and still exist today. In Sabah, all of the nine Chinese independent high schools in the state were formed in between 1960 and 1969. Characteristics Students usually spend six years in a Chinese Independent High School. The six years are divided into two stages: three years in junior middle and three years in senior middle, similar to the secondary school systems in mainland China and Taiwan. Students are streamed into tracks like Science or Art/Commerce in the senior middle stage. At the end of each stage, students sit for the Unified Examination Certificate (UEC). A few schools offer an additional year in senior middle, catering to students taking the government's Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Malaysia (STPM, equivalent to A-level). Chinese independent high schools use the same academic year as government schools. An academic year consists of two semesters: Semester 1 from January to May and Semester 2 from June to November, with examinations at the end of each semester. The overall academic performance of a student in an academic year determines his/her promotion to the next study year in the next academic year. Failing requires repeating the study year. Usually, failing to be promoted for two years in a row results in a dismissal. In contrast, students in government schools are automatically promoted regardless of academic performance. The curriculum used in Chinese independent high schools is developed and coordinated by the Curriculum Department of UCSCAM with reference to secondary education curricula around the world, particularly Malaysia's national secondary education curriculum and those of mainland China as well as Taiwan. UCSCAM publishes textbooks for use in Chinese independent high schools. =Unified Examination Certificate (UEC)= The Unified Examination Certificate (UEC) is a standardised test for Chinese independent high school students organised by the UCSCAM since 1975. The UEC is available in three levels: Junior Middle (UEC-JML), Vocational (UEC-V), and Senior Middle (UEC-SML). Examinations for non-language subjects in the UEC-JML (except in Sabah) and UEC-V are in Chinese. In Sabah, UEC-JML science and mathematics are available in Chinese and English. The UEC-SML has examinations for mathematics, sciences (biology, chemistry and physics), book keeping, accounting, and commerce available in Chinese and English, while other non- language subjects are only available in Chinese. The UEC-SML is recognised as a qualification for entrance into many tertiary educational institutions around the world, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Taiwan, Hong Kong, China, Japan, Singapore, Australia, Canada and many others. It is not recognised by the government of Malaysia for entry into public universities, but most private colleges recognise it. Because the UEC is not recognised by the Malaysian government, some Chinese independent high schools opt to teach the national secondary school curriculum (in Malay) alongside the independent school curriculum (in Chinese) and require students to sit for the government standardised tests (PMR, SPM or even STPM) as private school candidates, providing the students an opportunity to obtain government- recognised certificates. Chinese educationalist Dr Kua Kia Soong mentions the introduction of the UEC in his book Protean Saga: The Chinese Schools of Malaysia. According to the book, the introduction of the UEC led to Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the then Minister of Education and later the Prime Minister of Malaysia, summoning the Chinese educationalists to parliament. To quote the book, \\"The latter (Mahathir) did not mince his words but told the Dong Jiao Zong leaders that UEC had better not be held or else ... He did not ask for any response and dismissed the Chinese educationalists with a curt ... 'that is all'.\\" In May 2004 the National Accreditation Board (LAN) required students entering local private colleges using any qualification other than the SPM to pass the SPM Malay paper. This drew protests and caused the then Minister of Higher Education Dr Shafie Salleh exempted UEC students from this requirement. =Medium of teaching= Majority of the Chinese Independent High Schools uses Mandarin as the medium of instruction. The official textbooks are written in Mandarin and exam papers are set in Mandarin. However, there are also a number of schools that developed English teaching materials and uses English as the medium of teaching.

History  Portlethen Village is situated slightly to the east of the ancient Causey Mounth trackway, which road was constructed to make passable this only available medieval route from coastal points south from Stonehaven north to Aberdeen. This ancient trackway specifically connected the River Dee crossing (where the present Bridge of Dee is situated) via Portlethen Moss, Muchalls Castle and Stonehaven to the south.C.Michael Hogan, Causey Mounth, Megalithic Portal, ed. by A.

It also has a small public house called The Neuk frequented by Jimmy fra nichts and the nightshift. Castle It has been noted that Portlethen Village once had a castle nearby similar to the one at Muchalls. Legend has it that Portlethen castle had a secret cave leading to the sea like the one at Muchalls Castle. No one is sure why this 17th-century building no longer exists. It stood at the site of the Mains of Portlethen farm. Remains of the castle's walls are present in the farmhouse. The castle may have been L-Plan like most of the castles in the area, such as Muchalls Castle. The castle was built by Robert Buchan, who owned the estate of Portlethen in the 17th century.

Since equilibrium is maintained at all steps, the process is reversible (equilibrium folding). Equilibrium unfolding is used to determine the conformational stability of the molecule. Theoretical background In its simplest form, equilibrium unfolding assumes that the molecule may belong to only two thermodynamic states, the folded state (typically denoted N for \\"native\\" state) and the unfolded state (typically denoted U). This \\"all-or-none\\" model of protein folding was first proposed by Tim Anson in 1945,Anson ML, Protein Denaturation and the Properties of Protein Groups, Advances in Protein Chemistry, 2, 361-386 (1945) but is believed to hold only for small, single structural domains of proteins (Jackson, 1998); larger domains and multi-domain proteins often exhibit intermediate states. As usual in statistical mechanics, these states correspond to ensembles of molecular conformations, not just one conformation. The molecule may transition between the native and unfolded states according to a simple kinetic model :N U with rate constants k_{f} and k_{u} for the folding (U -> N) and unfolding (N -> U) reactions, respectively. The dimensionless equilibrium constant K_{eq} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\frac{k_{u}}{k_{f}} = \\\\frac{\\\\left[\\\\ce U \\\\right]_{eq}}{\\\\left[\\\\ce N \\\\right]_{eq}} can be used to determine the conformational stability \\\\Delta G^o by the equation : \\\\Delta G^ o = -RT \\\\ln K_{eq} where R is the gas constant and T is the absolute temperature in kelvin. Thus, \\\\Delta G^o is positive if the unfolded state is less stable (i.e., disfavored) relative to the native state. The most direct way to measure the conformational stability \\\\Delta G^o of a molecule with two-state folding is to measure its kinetic rate constants k_{f} and k_{u} under the solution conditions of interest. However, since protein folding is typically completed in milliseconds, such measurements can be difficult to perform, usually requiring expensive stopped flow or (more recently) continuous-flow mixers to provoke folding with a high time resolution. Dual polarisation interferometry is an emerging technique to directly measure conformational change and \\\\Delta G^o. Chemical denaturation In the less extensive technique of equilibrium unfolding, the fractions of folded and unfolded molecules (denoted as p_{N} and p_{U}, respectively) are measured as the solution conditions are gradually changed from those favoring the native state to those favoring the unfolded state, e.g., by adding a denaturant such as guanidinium hydrochloride or urea. (In equilibrium folding, the reverse process is carried out.) Given that the fractions must sum to one and their ratio must be given by the Boltzmann factor, we have : p_{N} = \\\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\\\Delta G/RT}} : p_{U} = 1 - p_{N} = \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\Delta G/RT}}{1 + e^{-\\\\Delta G/RT}} = \\\\frac{1}{1 + e^{\\\\Delta G/RT}} Protein stabilities are typically found to vary linearly with the denaturant concentration. A number of models have been proposed to explain this observation prominent among them being the denaturant binding model, solvent-exchange model (both by John SchellmanSchellmann, JA, The thermodynamics of solvent exchange, Biopolymers 34, 1015‚Äì1026 (1994)) and the Linear Extrapolation Model (LEM; by Nick PaceMyers JK, Pace CN, Scholtz JM, Denaturant m values and heat capacity changes: relation to changes in accessible surface areas of protein unfolding, Protein Sci. 4(10), 2138‚Äì2148 (1995)). All of the models assume that only two thermodynamic states are populated/de-populated upon denaturation. They could be extended to interpret more complicated reaction schemes. The denaturant binding model assumes that there are specific but independent sites on the protein molecule (folded or unfolded) to which the denaturant binds with an effective (average) binding constant k. The equilibrium shifts towards the unfolded state at high denaturant concentrations as it has more binding sites for the denaturant relative to the folded state (\\\\Delta n). In other words, the increased number of potential sites exposed in the unfolded state is seen as the reason for denaturation transitions. An elementary treatment results in the following functional form: : \\\\Delta G = \\\\Delta G_{w} - RT \\\\Delta n \\\\ln \\\\left(1 + k [D] \\\\right) where \\\\Delta G_{w} is the stability of the protein in water and [D] is the denaturant concentration. Thus the analysis of denaturation data with this model requires 7 parameters: \\\\Delta G_{w},\\\\Delta n, k, and the slopes and intercepts of the folded and unfolded state baselines. The solvent exchange model (also called the ‚Äòweak binding model‚Äô or ‚Äòselective solvation‚Äô) of Schellman invokes the idea of an equilibrium between the water molecules bound to independent sites on protein and the denaturant molecules in solution. It has the form: : \\\\Delta G = \\\\Delta G_{w} - RT \\\\Delta n \\\\ln \\\\left(1 + (K-1) X_{D} \\\\right) where K is the equilibrium constant for the exchange reaction and X_{d} is the mole-fraction of the denaturant in solution. This model tries to answer the question of whether the denaturant molecules actually bind to the protein or they seem to be bound just because denaturants occupy about 20-30% of the total solution volume at high concentrations used in experiments, i.e. non-specific effects ‚Äì and hence the term ‚Äòweak binding‚Äô. As in the denaturant-binding model, fitting to this model also requires 7 parameters. One common theme obtained from both these models is that the binding constants (in the molar scale) for urea and guanidinium hydrochloride are small: ~ 0.2 M^{-1} for urea and 0.6 M^{-1} for GuHCl. Intuitively, the difference in the number of binding sites between the folded and unfolded states is directly proportional to the differences in the accessible surface area. This forms the basis for the LEM which assumes a simple linear dependence of stability on the denaturant concentration. The resulting slope of the plot of stability versus the denaturant concentration is called the m-value. In pure mathematical terms, m-value is the derivative of the change in stabilization free energy upon the addition of denaturant. However, a strong correlation between the accessible surface area (ASA) exposed upon unfolding, i.e. difference in the ASA between the unfolded and folded state of the studied protein (dASA), and the m-value has been documented by Pace and co-workers. In view of this observation, the m-values are typically interpreted as being proportional to the dASA. There is no physical basis for the LEM and it is purely empirical, though it is widely used in interpreting solvent-denaturation data. It has the general form: : \\\\Delta G = m \\\\left( [D]_{1/2} - [D] \\\\right) where the slope m is called the \\"m-value\\"(> 0 for the above definition) and \\\\left[ D \\\\right]_{1/2} (also called Cm) represents the denaturant concentration at which 50% of the molecules are folded (the denaturation midpoint of the transition, where p_{N} = p_{U} = 1/2). In practice, the observed experimental data at different denaturant concentrations are fit to a two-state model with this functional form for \\\\Delta G, together with linear baselines for the folded and unfolded states. The m and \\\\left[ D \\\\right]_{1/2} are two fitting parameters, along with four others for the linear baselines (slope and intercept for each line); in some cases, the slopes are assumed to be zero, giving four fitting parameters in total. The conformational stability \\\\Delta G can be calculated for any denaturant concentration (including the stability at zero denaturant) from the fitted parameters m and \\\\left[ D \\\\right]_{1/2}. When combined with kinetic data on folding, the m-value can be used to roughly estimate the amount of buried hydrophobic surface in the folding transition state. =Structural probes= Unfortunately, the probabilities p_{N} and p_{U} cannot be measured directly. Instead, we assay the relative population of folded molecules using various structural probes, e.g., absorbance at 287 nm (which reports on the solvent exposure of tryptophan and tyrosine), far-ultraviolet circular dichroism (180-250 nm, which reports on the secondary structure of the protein backbone), dual polarisation interferometry (which reports the molecular size and fold density) and near-ultraviolet fluorescence (which reports on changes in the environment of tryptophan and tyrosine). However, nearly any probe of folded structure will work; since the measurement is taken at equilibrium, there is no need for high time resolution. Thus, measurements can be made of NMR chemical shifts, intrinsic viscosity, solvent exposure (chemical reactivity) of side chains such as cysteine, backbone exposure to proteases, and various hydrodynamic measurements. To convert these observations into the probabilities p_{N} and p_{U}, one generally assumes that the observable A adopts one of two values, A_{N} or A_{U}, corresponding to the native or unfolded state, respectively. Hence, the observed value equals the linear sum : A = A_{N} p_{N} + A_{U} p_{U} By fitting the observations of A under various solution conditions to this functional form, one can estimate A_{N} and A_{U}, as well as the parameters of \\\\Delta G. The fitting variables A_{N} and A_{U} are sometimes allowed to vary linearly with the solution conditions, e.g., temperature or denaturant concentration, when the asymptotes of A are observed to vary linearly under strongly folding or strongly unfolding conditions. Thermal denaturation Assuming a two state denaturation as stated above, one can derive the fundamental thermodynamic parameters namely, \\\\Delta H, \\\\Delta S and \\\\Delta G provided one has knowledge on the \\\\Delta C_p of the system under investigation. The thermodynamic observables of denaturation can be described by the following equations: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta H(T)&=\\\\Delta H(T_d)+ \\\\int_{T_d}^T \\\\Delta C_p dT  &=\\\\Delta H(T_d)+ \\\\Delta C_p[T-T_d]  \\\\Delta S(T)&=\\\\frac{\\\\Delta H(T_d)}{T_d}+ \\\\int_{T_d}^T \\\\Delta C_p d \\\\ln T  &=\\\\frac{\\\\Delta H(T_d)}{T_d}+ \\\\Delta C_p \\\\ln \\\\frac{T}{T_d}  \\\\Delta G(T)&=\\\\Delta H -T \\\\Delta S  &=\\\\Delta H(T_d) \\\\frac{T_d-T}{T_d}+ \\\\int_{T_d}^T \\\\Delta C_p dT - T\\\\int_{T_d}^T \\\\Delta C_p d \\\\ln T  &=\\\\Delta H(T_d)\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{T}{T_d}\\\\right) - \\\\Delta C_p\\\\left[T_d -T +T \\\\ln (\\\\frac{T}{T_d})\\\\right] \\\\end{align} where \\\\ \\\\Delta H, \\\\ \\\\Delta S and \\\\ \\\\Delta G indicate the enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy of unfolding under a constant pH and pressure. The temperature, \\\\ T is varied to probe the thermal stability of the system and \\\\ T_d is the temperature at which half of the molecules in the system are unfolded. The last equation is known as the Gibbs‚ÄìHelmholtz equation. =Determining the heat capacity of proteins= In principle one can calculate all the above thermodynamic observables from a single differential scanning calorimetry thermogram of the system assuming that the \\\\ \\\\Delta C_p is independent of the temperature. However, it is difficult to obtain accurate values for \\\\ \\\\Delta C_p this way. More accurately, the \\\\ \\\\Delta C_p can be derived from the variations in \\\\ \\\\Delta H(T_d) vs. \\\\ T_d which can be achieved from measurements with slight variations in pH or protein concentration. The slope of the linear fit is equal to the \\\\ \\\\Delta C_p. Note that any non-linearity of the datapoints indicates that \\\\ \\\\Delta C_p is probably not independent of the temperature. Alternatively, the \\\\ \\\\Delta C_p can also be estimated from the calculation of the accessible surface area (ASA) of a protein prior and after thermal denaturation as follows: :\\\\ \\\\Delta ASA=ASA_{unfolded}-ASA_{native} For proteins that have a known 3d structure, the \\\\ ASA_{native} can be calculated through computer programs such as Deepview (also known as swiss PDB viewer). The ASA_{unfolded} can be calculated from tabulated values of each amino acid through the semi-empirical equation: :\\\\ce{ASA_{unfolded}} = a_\\\\ce{polar} \\\\times \\\\ce{ASA_{polar}} + a_\\\\ce{aromatic} \\\\times \\\\ce{ASA_{aromatic}} + a_\\\\ce{non-polar} \\\\times \\\\ce{ASA_{non-polar}} where the subscripts polar, non- polar and aromatic indicate the parts of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. Finally for proteins there is a linear correlation between \\\\ \\\\Delta ASA and \\\\ \\\\Delta C_p through the following equation:Robertson, A.D., Murphy, K.P. Protein structure and the energetics of protein stability, (1997), Chem Rev, 97, 1251-1267 :\\\\ \\\\Delta C_p=0.61*\\\\Delta \\\\ce{ASA} =Assessing two-state unfolding= Furthermore, one can assess whether the folding proceeds according to a two-state unfolding as described above. This can be done with differential scanning calorimetry by comparing the calorimetric enthalpy of denaturation i.e. the area under the peak, A_\\\\text{peak} to the van 't Hoff enthalpy described as follows: :\\\\Delta H_{vH}(T)= -R\\\\frac{d\\\\ln K}{dT^{-1}} at T=T_d the \\\\Delta H_{vH}(T_d) can be described as: :\\\\Delta H_{vH}(T_d)= \\\\frac{RT_d^2 \\\\Delta C_p^{\\\\max}}{A_\\\\text{peak}} When a two-state unfolding is observed the A_\\\\text{peak}=\\\\Delta H_{vH}(T_d). The \\\\Delta C_p^{\\\\max} is the height of the heat capacity peak. Generalization to complex proteins Using the above principles, equations that relate a global protein signal, corresponding to the folding states in equilibrium, and the variable value of a denaturing agent, either temperature or a chemical molecule, have been derived for homomeric and heteromeric proteins, from monomers to trimers and potentially tetramers. These equations provide a robust theoretical basis for measuring the stability of complex proteins, and for comparing the stabilities of wild type and mutant proteins. Such equations cannot be derived for pentamers of higher oligomers because of mathematical limitations (Abel‚ÄìRuffini theorem). Other forms of denaturation Analogous functional forms are possible for denaturation by pressure, pH, or by applying force with an atomic force microscope tip. References Further reading * Pace CN.

It was the direct forerunner of Yorkshire County Cricket Club and some of the teams fielded by Sheffield were styled Yorkshire. Sheffield generally held first- class status, depending on the quality of their opponents, from 1827 to 1855. Earliest cricket in Yorkshire The earliest known references to cricket in Yorkshire are in 1751.It is possible that cricket was played in North America before it reached Yorkshire. There are early 17th century references to the game in America but the earliest known references to cricket in Yorkshire are as late as 1751. These relate to local matches in Sheffield and to a game on or soon after Monday, 5 August at Stanwick, near Richmond, between the Duke of Cleveland‚Äôs XI and Earl of Northumberland‚Äôs XI (the same teams had earlier played in Durham and this is Durham's earliest cricket reference).Waghorn, p. 27. It is believed that Sheffield Cricket Club was founded soon after that date and it began to play matches against teams from other northern towns, including some inter-county fixtures. Sheffield cricket Sheffield quickly became the main centre for cricket in Yorkshire. In September 1757, a match took place between Wirksworth and Sheffield at Brampton Moor, near Chesterfield. This is the earliest reference to cricket in Derbyshire. William White's History & General Directory of the Borough of Sheffield (1833) has the following information: \\"In 1757 we find the Town Trustees attempting the abolition of brutal sports by paying 14s6d to the cricket players on Shrove Tuesday to entertain the populace and prevent the infamous practice of throwing at cocks\\". Mr White does not give the primary source from which he himself derived the information but it would likely be in parish or town records of some kind which may or may not still exist.Waghorn, p. 31. Sheffield v. Leeds On Tuesday, 7 July 1761, the Leeds Intelligencer (now the Yorkshire Post) announced a game to be played at Chapeltown the following Thursday (9 July) and this is the first game known to have been played in the Leeds area.Buckley, Pre-Victorian, p. 3. On Thursday, 5 September 1765, the London Chronicle reported a \\"great match\\" on Monday, 26 August: Leeds v Sheffield at Chapeltown Moor, near Leeds. Sheffield won \\"with great difficulty\\". As this game was highly rated and was reported by a London newspaper, it shows that cricket was well established in Yorkshire only 14 years after it was first reported there.Buckley, Pre-Victorian, p. 4. Sheffield v. Nottingham In August 1771, the first of many matches between Sheffield and Nottingham was held. This one took place on the Forest Racecourse at Nottingham and is the earliest known reference to cricket in Nottinghamshire and to any team from the county. The result of the game is unknown because \\"of a dispute having arisen by one of the Sheffield players being jostled\\" and the reports mention a Sheffield player called Osguthorpe who \\"kept in batting for several hours together\\".Buckley, Pre-Victorian, p. 6. This match may tentatively be regarded as the beginning of county-level cricket in the north of England. The Sheffield club was representative of its county in a similar fashion to Nottingham and (much later) Manchester. Although standards of play in the south were probably much higher than in the north at this time, the same scenario can be observed re the Hornchurch, Maidenhead, Chertsey, Dartford and Hambledon clubs in their respective counties. In 1772, the Daily Messenger carried reports of a match in Sheffield on Monday, 1 June, in which Sheffield defeated Nottingham.Buckley, Pre- Victorian, p. 7. 19th century A cricket match at Darnall in the 1820s, a venue at which Sheffield often played. The Sheffield club continued to play occasional first-class matches, mainly against other northern clubs. In September 1833 occurred the first use of \\"Yorkshire\\" as the team name instead of \\"Sheffield\\". This was in the Yorkshire v Norfolk match at Hyde Park, Sheffield which Yorkshire won by 120 runs. The great Fuller Pilch was still playing for Norfolk. Yorkshire was by now finding star players of its own, especially the fast bowling all-rounder Tom Marsden. Although the Sheffield and Manchester clubs had met previously, there was a significant development on 23, 24 & 25 July 1849 when the match was called Yorkshire versus Lancashire at Hyde Park. This was the first match to involve a Lancashire county team and also, therefore, the first \\"Roses Match\\". Yorkshire won by 5 wickets. In the winter of 1854, the club agreed to build a new ground on land near to Bramall Lane which they were to lease from the Duke of Norfolk for ninety-nine years. The first game played at Bramall Lane on 30 April 1855 between \\"The Eleven\\" and \\"The Twenty-two\\" resulted in the senior team losing by an innings and 28 runs. On 7 March 1861, a Match Fund Committee to run Yorkshire county matches was established in Sheffield, which had by then been the home of Yorkshire cricket for nearly 100 years. It was from this fund that Yorkshire County Cricket Club was founded two years later. This was an exact parallel with the foundation of Sussex County Cricket Club from a similar fund (1836‚Äì1839). On 8 January 1863, the formation of Yorkshire County Cricket Club was agreed at a meeting of the Sheffield Match Fund Committee in the Adelphi Hotel, Sheffield.

This overarching approach began as advances in neuroscience lead to breakthroughs which held pertinent information for the field of psychoanalysis. Despite advantages for these fields to interconnect, there is some concern that too much emphasis on neurobiological physiology of the brain will undermine the importance of dialogue and exploration that is foundational to the field of psychoanalysis. Critics will also point to the qualitative and subjective nature of the field of psychoanalysis, claiming it cannot be fully reconciled with the quantitative and objective nature of neuroscientific research. However, despite this critique, proponents of the field of neuropsychoanalysis remind critics that the father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud himself, began his career as a neuroanatomist, further arguing that research in this category proves that the psychodynamic effects of the mind are inextricably linked to neural activity in the brain. Indeed, neuroscientific progress has created a shared study of many of the same cognitive phenomenon, and proponents for a distinct field under the heading of neuropsychoanalysis point to the ability for observation of both the subjective mind and empirical evidence in neurobiology to provide greater understanding and greater curative methods. Therefore, neurospsychoanalysis aims to bring a field, often viewed as belonging more to the humanities than the sciences, into the scientific realm and under the umbrella of neuroscience, distinct from psychoanalysis, and yet adding to the plethora of insight garnered from it.  History  Neuropsychoanalysis as a discipline can be traced as far back as Sigmund Freud's manuscript, \\"Project for a Scientific Psychology\\". Written in 1895, but only published posthumously, Freud developed his theories of the neurobiological function of the storage of memory in this work. His statement, based on his theory that memory is biologically stored in the brain by, \\"a permanent alteration following an event\\", had a prophetic insight into the empirical discoveries that would corroborate these theories close to 100 years later. Freud speculated that psychodynamics and neurobiology would eventually reunite as one field of study. While time would eventually prove him correct to some degree, the latter half of the 20th century only saw a very gradual movement in this direction with only a few individuals championing this line of thought. Significant advances in neuroscience throughout the 20th century created a clearer understanding of the functionality of the brain, which have vastly enhanced the way we view the mind. This began in the 1930s with the invention of electroencephalography, which enabled imaging of the brain as never seen before. A decade later the use of dynamic localization, or the lesion method, further shed light onto the interaction of systems in the brain. Computerized tomography lead to even greater understanding of the interaction within the brain, and finally the invention of multiple scan technologies in the 1990s, the fMRI, PET, and the SPECT gave researchers empirical evidence of neurobiological processes. It was in 1999, just before the turn of the century, that the term \\"neuropsychoanalysis\\" was used in a new journal entitled with the same name. This term once was hyphenated to indicate that the conjoining of the two fields of study did not suggest that they had been fully integrated, but rather that this new line of scientific inquiry was interdisciplinary. With repeated use, the hyphen was lost, and the name appears as we see it today. Theoretical base = Dual-aspect monism = Neuropsychoanalysis is best described as a marriage between neuroscience and psychoanalysis. However its relationship to the broader field of neuropsychology: relating biological brain to psychological functions and behavior, cannot be denied. Indeed, neuropsychoanalysis further seeks to remedy classical neurology's exclusion of the subjective mind. The subjective mind, that is, sensations, thoughts, feelings and consciousness, can seem antithetical to the cellular matter that makes up the neurobiology of the brain. Indeed, while Freud is most often credited with being the seminal creator of the study of the mind in mordern terms, it was Descartes who concluded that mind and brain were two entirely different kinds of stuff. Accordingly, he invented the \\"dualism\\" of the mind, the mind-body dichotomy. Body is one kind of thing, and mind (or spirit or soul) is another. But since this second kind of stuff does not lend itself to scientific inquiry, many of today's psychologists and neuroscientists have seemingly rejected Cartesian dualism. Neuropsychoanalysis meets this challenge via dual-aspect monism, sometimes referred to as perspectivism. That is, we are monistic. Our brains, including mind, are made of one kind of stuff, cells, but we perceive this stuff in two different ways. = Psychoanalysis as a foundation = Perhaps because Freud himself began his career as a neurologist, psychoanalysis has given the field of neuroscience the platform upon which many of its scientific hypotheses were founded. With the field of psychoanalysis suffering from what many see as a decline in innovation and popularity, a call for new approaches and a more scientific methodology is long overdue. The history of neuropsychoanalysis therefore, goes some way in explaining why some consider it the logical conclusion, and representative of an evolution that psychoanalysis was in need of. Since the mind itself is viewed as purely ontological, our appreciation of reality is dependent on neurobiological functions of the brain, which we can use to observe \\"subjectively,\\" from inside, how we feel and what we think. Freud refined this kind of observation into free association. He claimed and that this is the best technique that we have for perceiving complex mental functions that simple introspection will not reveal. Through psychoanalysis, we can discover mind's unconscious functioning. = Neuroscience as a foundation = Due to the very nature of neuropsychoanalysis, those working in this burgeoning field have been able to draw useful insights from a number of distinguished neuroscientists, indeed many of these now serve on the editorial board of the journal Neuropsychoanalysis. Some of these more notable names foundational to the development of neuropsychoanalysis include: * Antonio Damasio * Eric Kandel * Joseph LeDoux * Helen Mayberg * Jaak Panksepp * VS Ramachandran * Oliver Sacks * Mark Solms Neuroscientists, often studying the same cognitive functions of the brain as psychoanalysts, do so in quantitative methods such as dissection post mortem, small lesions administered to create certain curative effects, or with the visual and objective aid of brain imaging, all of which enable researchers to trace neurochemical pathways and build a more accurate understanding of the physical functioning of the brain. Another branch of neuroscience also observes the \\"mind\\" from outside, that is, by means of neurological examination. This is often done in the form of physical tests, such as questionnaires, the Boston Naming test or Wisconsin Sorting, creating bisecting lines, acting out how one performs daily tasks such as a screwdriver, just to name a few. Neurologists can compare the changes in psychological function that the neurological examination shows with the associated changes in the brain, either post mortem or by means of modern imaging technology. Much of neuroscience aims to break down and tease out the cognitive and biological functions behind both conscious and unconscious actions within the brain. In this way it is no different than psychoanalysis, which has had similar goals since its inception. Therefore, to ignore the additional insight neuroscience can offer psychoanalysis would be to limit a huge source of knowledge that can only enhance psychoanalysis as a whole.  Research directions  Neuropsychoanalytic relate unconscious (and sometimes conscious) functioning discovered through the techniques of psychoanalysis or experimental psychology to underlying brain processes. Among the ideas explored in recent research are the following: * \\"Consciousness\\" is limited (5-9 bits of information) compared to emotional and unconscious thinking based in the limbic system. Note: Solm's book showed as reference in the footnote does not provide such an information. It may be confused with the capacity of short-term memory. * Secondary-process, reality-oriented thinking can be understood as frontal lobe executive control systems. * Dreams, confabulations, and other expressions of primary-process thinking are meaningful, wish-fulfilling manifestations of the loss of frontal executive control of mesocortical and mesolimbic \\"seeking\\" systems. * Freud's \\"libido\\" corresponds to a dopaminergic seeking system * Drives can be understood as a series of basic emotions (prompts to action) anchored in pontine regions, specifically the periaqueductal gray, and projecting to cortex: play; seeking; caring; fear; anger; sadness. Seeking is constantly active; the others seek appropriate consummations (corresponding to Freud's \\"dynamic\\" unconscious). * Seemingly rational and conscious decisions are driven from the limbic system by emotions which are unconscious. * Infantile amnesia (the absence of memory for the first years of life) occurs because the verbal left hemisphere becomes activated later, in the second or third year of life, after the non-verbal right hemisphere. But infants can and do have procedural and emotional memories. * Infants' first-year experiences of attachment and second-year (approximately) experiences of disapproval lay down pathways that regulate emotions and profoundly affect adult personality. * Oedipal behaviors (observable in primates) can be understood as the effort to integrate lust systems (testosterone-driven), romantic love (dopamine-driven), and attachment (oxytocin-driven) in relation to key persons in the environment. * Differences between the sexes are more biologically-based and less environmentally-driven than Freud believed.

Origin  The platform preamble was written by Ignatius L. Donnelly. The Omaha platform was seen as \\"The Second Declaration of Independence,\\" as it called for reestablishing American liberty. The planks themselves represent the merger of the agrarian concerns of the Farmers' Alliance with the free- currency monetarism of the Greenback Party while explicitly endorsing the goals of the largely urban Knights of Labor. In the words of Donnelly's preamble, the convention was \\"[a]ssembled on the anniversary of the birthday of the nation, and filled with the spirit of the grand general and chieftain who established our independence, we seek to restore the government of the Republic to the hands of the plain people, with which class it originated.\\" The Omaha Platform called for a wide range of social reforms, including a reduction in the working day, a \\"safe, sound, and flexible\\" national currency, assistance to farmers with the financing of their labours, \\"fair and liberal pensions to ex-Union soldiers and sailors,\\" the direct election of Senators, single-terms for Presidents and Vice-Presidents, \\"the legislative system known as the initiative and referendum,\\" \\"the unperverted Australian of secret ballot system,\\" the nationalization of the railroads, the telegraph, and the telephone systems, a postal savings, \\"a graduated income tax,\\" and \\"the free and unlimited coinage of silver.\\" In referencing the Omaha Platform, Senator George W. Norris of Nebraska suggested the wealth of the \\"super rich\\" had to begin flowing \\"to all the people, from whom it was originally taken.\\" The Populist, or People's, Party went on to capture 11 seats in the United States House of Representatives, several governors and the state legislatures of Kansas, Nebraska and North Carolina. 1892 Presidential nominee and former Greenbacker James B. Weaver received over a million popular votes, and won four states (Colorado, Kansas, Idaho, and Nevada) and 22 electoral votes. The Party's legislative majorities were thereafter able to elect several United States Senators. Taken as a whole, the electoral accomplishments of the Populist Party represent the high water mark for a United States third party after the Civil War. In 1896, the Populists abandoned the Omaha Platform and endorsed Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan on the basis of a single- plank free silver platform.  Goals  The first goal of the Omaha Platform was to increase the coinage of silver to gold at a 16:1 ratio. The Omaha Platform suggested a federal loans system so that farmers could get the money they needed. The platform also called for the elimination of private banks. The platform required a system of federal storage facilities for the farmers' crops. The objective was to allow the farmers to control the pricing of their products. The Omaha Platform made a special taxing system for them so that they would have to pay taxes depending on how much money they made. They also asked for an eight-hour workday and the direct election of senators, as opposed to them being elected by state legislatures. Those were the main goals of the Omaha Platform, all focused on helping rural and working-class Americans. They also made it so that farmers would only work 8 hours instead of 10 or more. After 1894, Populists emphasized the demand for free coinage of silver rather than other goals, such as state-run railroads. Dissolution The platform did not appeal to the more urban areas of the country where wage earners were working industrial jobs. The platform's only clear attempt to appeal to northerners in the east was the clause mentioning pensions to ex- Union soldiers. The Populist Party dissolved before World War II as members were unable to meet in Omaha for the party's semi-centennial celebration, and for the reason that many of the party's values have been accepted by other, more dominant political parties.

He also traveled to California, United States. Then he joined his father traveling between England, Switzerland, France, and reached Egypt on the eve World War I. They remained there until his father's death. Mohammad al-Abed moved back to Damascus in the summer of 1920 when Syria came under the French Mandate. In 1922, Al-Abed was appointed Syria's Minister of Finance. Al-Abed was fluent in Arabic, French, and Turkish. He was fond of French literature and economics. He also had a good knowledge of English and Persian. On 30 April 1932 Al-Abed was elected to the parliament in Damascus as a nominee of the National Bloc ( Syria ) and then elevated to the presidency on 11 June of the same year. In 1936, after a free parliament was elected in Damascus, he resigned and went to Paris, where he died in 1939. He was replaced by Mr.Hashim al-Atassi, the nominee of the National Bloc, though Syria remained in control militarily until full independence in 1946.

Interpretations =Royal propaganda= One interpretation is that the stele is propaganda put out by the pharaoh, to cover up the supposed depredations of officials of the embattled 17th Dynasty drawing upon the financial resources of the temples during the escalating conflict with the Hyksos. =Thera eruption= The argument has been made that there was \\"a meteorological event of far-reaching proportions, one of the major aftereffects, we strongly suspect, of the Thera eruption\\" and that the stele reflects an eye-witness account of the eruption. Others argue that given the description in the stele, this is unlikely. Archaeologists have traditionally placed the date of the Theran eruption at approximately 1500 BCE. Radiocarbon dates, including analysis of an olive branch buried beneath a lava flow from the volcano that gave a date between 1627 BCE and 1600 BCE (95% confidence interval), suggest an eruption date more than a century earlier than suggested by archaeologists. Thus, the radiocarbon dates and the archaeological dates are in substantial disagreement. In 2014, Nadine Moeller and Robert Ritner offered a new translation of the Tempest Stela. They believe the unusual weather patterns described on the slab were the result of a massive volcano explosion at Thera. They also suggest that the Egyptian pharaoh Ahmose I ruled at a time closer to the Thera eruption than previously thought; in the conventional but disputed Egyptian chronology he ruled from .Ancient stormy weather: World's oldest weather report could revise bronze age chronology. sciencedaily.com, April 2014 Additional scientific research published in 2018 also suggests a correlation. Volcanic eruptions are frequently accompanied by earthquakes. Egypt is one of few African nations that is occasionally hit by strong earthquakes. So it is possible that Egypt was affected by the atmospheric effects of the Minoan eruption and was struck by an earthquake. References Further reading * Davis, E.

This expedition operated jointly with two other expeditions, the Foureau-Lamy and Gentil missions, which advanced from Algeria and Middle Congo respectively. The refusal of the expedition commander and his second-in-command to follow orders from France, their murder of a commanding officer and their subsequent deaths at the hands of their own soldiers cast a dark shadow over France's emerging colonial empire in Africa at the end of the 19th century. The expedition is remembered for its descent into depravity and extreme violence, actions which today would legally be considered war crimes. Structure and directives The Voulet‚ÄìChanoine Mission to Lake Chad set out from Dakar in November 1898, moving through French Sudan (modern Mali). It was composed of 50 Senegalese Tirailleurs, 20 spahis (both units recruited in West Africa) and 30 interpreters, but the bulk was formed by 400 auxiliaries and 800 porters that were pressed into service. The force was directed by nine European officers, the two commanders, the artillery expert lieutenant Paul Joalland, Lt. Louis Peteau, Marine-Lt. Marc Pallier, the medical officer Dr. Henric and three NCOs. The expedition was fully armed with artillery, machine guns, hundreds of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition. In command were captain Paul Voulet and his adjutant Lt. Julien Chanoine. The captain, a 32-year-old son of a doctor, was said by his officer colleagues to mix \\"a true love of blood and cruelty coupled with a sometimes foolish sensitivity\\"; while the lieutenant, son of the general and future War Minister Charles Chanoine, was judged impulsive, ruthless and \\"cruel out of cold-bloodedness as well as for pleasure\\". Both had already proved their ruthlessness and efficiency two years before, when they invaded the Mossi Kingdoms and conquered its capital Ouagadougou.S. Lindqvist, Exterminate All the Brutes, p. 163 The mission was the brainchild of Voulet, who saw it as a means to further his career. He actively sought support from French politicians, which was difficult to obtain because conflicts divided and preoccupied the Minister of Colonies Andr√© Lebon and the Minister of Foreign Affairs Gabriel Hanotaux. The political crisis of the Dreyfus Affair also consumed the attention of French politicians, making it even more difficult for Voulet to be heard. In spite of these obstacles, he successfully obtained approval for his project, with the help of his adjutant Chanoine. The four months of delay in the start of the mission‚Äîand the very limited funds granted‚Äîhad dire consequences for the future. Voulet completely ignored the local hierarchies and took liberties with the orders he received, which were anyway very vague‚Äîhe was asked only to explore the territory between the Niger River and Lake Chad, and put the area \\"under French protection\\". The Minister of Colonies merely said, \\"I don't pretend to be able to give you any instructions on which route to choose or how you are to behave towards the native chieftains.\\" In the opinion of the British historian G. Regan, this meant \\"giving carte blanche to two known psychopaths in uniform,\\" especially as Voulet had already told the governor of French Sudan that he meant to crush any resistance by burning villages. Division and reunion of the column Lieutenant-Colonel Jean-Fran√ßois Klobb When the column reached Koulikoro, on the Niger, it divided. Chanoine led most of the expedition overland across the 600-mile bend of the river, while Voulet took the rest of the men downriver to Timbuktu, held by Lieutenant-Colonel Jean-Fran√ßois Klobb, who provided him with another 70 tirailleurs and 20 spahis. Chanoine had increasing difficulties finding provisions for his large column in the arid region where he marched; he started pillaging the villages on the way, and gave orders for anyone trying to escape to be shot. In addition to these troubles, a dysentery epidemic broke out. By the end of the first two months the mission had lost 148 bearers to dysentery. Voulet and Chanoine reunited with the expedition in January at Say, the easternmost French post in Sudan (modern Niger). The column was by now 2,000 men strong, well over the number that their supplies could sustain. Even though they were in French-controlled areas, Voulet's troops started pillaging, looting, raping, and killing. Among the most brutal episodes was the sacking of the village of Sansann√©-Haoussa on 8 January 1899. One hundred and one people were killed, among them thirty women and children, to set an example in retaliation for the wounding of a couple of his soldiers. When at the end of the month the mission left the Niger River to pass into the semi-desert areas extending east, their march became an endless orgy of looting and killing. Scandal in Paris In January, Lt. Peteau, one of the mission's officers, told Voulet that he had had enough and was leaving; Voulet countered by dismissing him on 29 January 1899 for \\"lack of discipline and enthusiasm.\\" This decision eventually backfired: on 15 February Peteau wrote a letter to his fianc√©e that fully detailed the atrocities committed by Voulet and Chanoine that he had witnessed. Peteau's fianc√©e contacted her local deputy, who promptly sent her letter on to the Minister of Colonies Antoine Guillain. This brought about the decision by the Dupuy ministry on 20 April to arrest Voulet and Chanoine and send orders to the Governor-General of French Sudan, Colonel Vimard, to have them replaced at the head of the mission with the governor of Timbuktu, Klobb. Among the chief concerns of the French government was that Voulet was carrying out his depredations in Sokoto, an unconquered territory that by the Anglo- French agreement of June 1898 had been assigned to the United Kingdom. Klobb immediately left Timbuktu, taking fifty tirailleurs and Lt. Octave Meynier as his second. Meanwhile, Voulet was meeting considerable resistance to his advance from the local queen Sarraounia, and at Lougou on 16 April he encountered his hardest battle yet, with 4 men killed and 6 wounded. Voulet took his revenge on 8 May: in one of the worst massacres in French colonial history, he slaughtered all the inhabitants of the village of Birni-N'Konni, killing possibly thousands of people. Voulet's rebellion The assassination of lieutenant-colonel Klobb. Klobb followed the trail left by the \\"infernal column's\\" passage; a trail of burned villages and charred corpses. He passed trees where women had been hanged, and cooking fires where children had been roasted. He also found the corpses of the expedition's guides; those that had displeased Voulet had been strung up alive in a position that the foot went to the hyenas and the rest of the body to the vultures. On 10 July, after a pursuit of over 2000 km, Klobb arrived at Damangara, near Zinder, where the villagers informed him that Voulet and his men were just a few hours' march ahead. He sent an African sergeant with two soldiers to give Voulet a letter informing him that he had been removed from his position and was to return home immediately; to this Voulet replied that he had 600 guns against his (Klobb's) fifty, and would use them if he dared to come near. Voulet and Chanoine were careful not to inform the other officers of Klobb's letter, and in the following days kept them occupied in raids. On July 13 he conducted his last massacre: after a villager killed two of his men, Voulet had 150 women and children slaughtered. The same evening he wrote a second letter to Klobb, in which he again told him not to try to come closer. Klobb did not believe the other officers or the riflemen would dare to kill, or let be killed, a superior officer. He was unaware that Voulet had kept the new orders secret, and that as a precaution Voulet had made sure only himself and Chanoine would be present to receive him. Consequently, the following morning, Klobb proceeded with his men to Dankori, where Voulet waited. Upon seeing him, Voulet ordered his men to disperse and sent Klobb a last warning, which Klobb ignored. Klobb, after telling his men not to open fire under any circumstances, in full-dress uniform and with his L√©gion d'honneur medal pinned on his chest, proceeded alone toward Voulet, who kept telling him to go back. To emphasise his warnings Voulet ordered two salvos fired in the air. When Klobb addressed Voulet's men, reminding them of their duties, Voulet threatened them with a pistol and ordered them to open fire. Klobb fell, wounded, still ordering his men not to return fire; but his words were truncated by a new salvo that killed Klobb, while his soldiers fled. Voulet and Chanoine's deaths Voulet's and Chanoine's graves near the village of Maijirgui, Niger. Photo taken 1906. On the evening of Klobb's assassination, Voulet informed his officers of the clash and, while stripping off his galloons, proclaimed: \\"I'm no longer a Frenchman, I'm a black chief. With you, I will found an empire\\" (Je ne suis plus fran√ßais, je suis un chef noir. Avec vous, je vais fonder un empire). The officers' reaction was far from enthusiastic, and their mood infected the troop. On July 16 an informer told Voulet that the troop was about to mutiny. Voulet and Chanoine assembled the riflemen, and after shooting the informer in front of the troop‚Äîfor informing him too late of the impending mutiny‚ÄîVoulet harangued the soldiers about their duty to obey their leaders, while at the same time shooting at them. The Senegalese returned fire, killing Chanoine, but Voulet escaped into the darkness and found refuge with some villagers. A sergeant then informed Lt. Pallier, the first French officer he found, of what had happened, and pledged the loyalty of the troop to him. The last chapter of Voulet's rebellion was played out the following morning, when he tried to reenter the camp, but was blocked by a sentry who refused to let him pass. Voulet shot at him but missed, and the sentry killed him. Pallier, who was now in command, decided to take Zinder, then the biggest town in present-day Niger and a former vassal of the Bornu Empire; Pallier defeated the local ruler sarki Amadou, and took the city on July 30. The mission's completion Shortly afterwards, Pallier left Zinder with 300 riflemen to make a reconnaissance of the route to Lake Chad, but was forced by a mutiny among his men to make a premature return to the city. The soldiers had threatened to kill him if he didn't immediately take them back to Zinder and promise to send them back to French Sudan. Consequently, it was decided at Zinder to split the expedition, with 300 riflemen, Lt. Pallier, Dr. Henric and two European NCOs leaving immediately for French Sudan while the remaining 270 riflemen (who had pledged to continue the mission for another year) put themselves under the command of Lt. Paul Joalland. Klobb's former officer, Lt. Octave Meynier, became Joalland's second and the expedition became known as the Joalland-Meynier Mission. Joalland and Meynier remained for some time in Zinder to pacify the area; the sarki Amadou was killed on September 15 during a skirmish, which brought Zinder's territory under full control. This freed the two French officers to leave Zinder on October 3 to continue with their reconnaissance. They took 170 men and a cannon, while 100 men were left behind to secure the city under the command of the European sergeant Bouthel, who was awaiting the Foureau-Lamy mission that was heading towards Zinder from Algiers across the Sahara, and which arrived in November. In January 1900 Foureau and Lamy left Zinder, moving south-east towards the Komadugu Yobe River. They followed this river east to Lake Chad, north around the western and northern shores of the lake and then south along its eastern shore. Here they encountered Joalland who had travelled north, up the east side of the lake, to meet them. The united expeditions, now under the overall command of Lamy, returned south to Joalland's base camp on the right bank of the Chari River, near where it enters Lake Chad from the south. The joint expedition conquered Kouss√©ri in April 1900; shortly afterwards, on April 21, they were joined by a third expedition, the Gentil Mission, that had entered the area from the Congo and been awaiting them for some time in the region of Lake Chad. The following day, in the battle of Kouss√©ri, this combined force totally defeated Rabih az-Zubayr's forces, and Rabih was killed in the fight, his empire crumbling with him. This event meant that the original expedition had now accomplished all its main aims, that is, surveying the lands of Northern Nigeria and Niger (contributing to a clearer Franco- British delimitation of the colonial borders), uniting with the Foureau-Lamy mission and destroying Rabih's empire, which permitted the institution in September by the French government of the Military territory of Chad. Having achieved their goals, Joalland and Meynier left Chad and returned to French Sudan and the Niger River by November. Joalland, the doctor Henric and the other French officers, due to the military success of the campaign, were able to avoid court-martial. Both Joalland and Meynier went on to have successful careers, and become generals. Reactions in France When, in August 1899, the government made public the atrocities committed by the Voulet's expedition and the murder of Klobb, a storm of indignation arose from the press, and France's claim of a \\"civilizing mission\\" in Africa was tarnished, as was the army, whose prestige was already considerably weakened by the Dreyfus Affair. The expedition's eventual success greatly reduced the public indignation; and when the radical MP Paul Vign√© d'Octon proposed in the National Assembly on December 7, 1900 the formation of a parliamentary commission of inquiry, the government rejected the request as being \\"dangerous and purposeless\\". An enquiry requested by the Ministry of Colonies was closed on December 1, 1902, claiming that Voulet and Chanoine had been driven mad by the dreadful heat, the \\"soudanite aigu√´\\". The mission in literature and cinema After a long period of oblivion, the memory of the expedition was revived in 1976 by the writer Jacques-Francis Rolland in his Le Grand Captaine, honoured with the Prix des Maisons de la Presse. The book is centered on the figure of Voulet, seen as a titanic individual, reckless and unsubmissive, bloody for reasons of strategy. A very different perspective was taken in 1980 by Abdoulaye Mamani in Sarraounia, the masterpiece of Nigerien fiction. Here the protagonist is not the conqueror, the invader who is openly censured, but the African queen that refuses to submit, and whose heroism is extolled. There is no pretence of impartiality: the author himself was to call his work a roman engag√©, i.e. a politically motivated novel. Mamani was to participate in the 1986 screenplay of Sarraounia, a film based on his novel and directed by the Mauritanian Med Hondo, in a France-Burkina Faso coproduction that won the first prize in the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou. An anticolonialist epic, the work, like that of Mamani, sets out to offer a radically new African historical perspective, countering the Eurocentric view. A French television movie produced by Serge Moati in 2004, Capitaines des t√©n√®bres, focuses on the column, and especially on its two captains. The film is openly influenced by Joseph Conrad's novella Heart of Darkness and in particular by its character Kurtz, of whom Voulet is seen as an incarnation. The material collected for Moati's movie also provides the basis of the documentary Blancs de m√©moire, directed by Manuel Gasquet, that follows in the expedition's footsteps and examines its impact on the inhabitants of the areas it passed through.

He specialised in lavish still lifes and animal paintings. He moved to Paris, where he worked in the gobelin factory and became a painter to the king. Pieter Boel revolutionized animal painting by working directly from live animals in a natural setting. He thus arrived at representations of animals showing them in their natural, characteristic poses. He had many followers in France.Adeline Collange, 'Study of a Crowned Crane' Life He was baptized in Antwerp on 10 October 1622 as the son of Jan Boel and Anna van der Straeten. He was member of a family of artists. His grandfather Jeroom had been a painter who was registered as a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1620. His father was an engraver and his older brother Quirijn de Younger became an engraver. After studying drawing with his father he became a pupil of Jan Fijt, a well-known still life and animal painter.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, p. 1095-1096 Jan Fijt had studied under the leading Flemish animal and still life painter Frans Snyders.Joannes Fijt at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Allegory of the Vanities of the World, 1663 He is believed to have traveled to Italy in the 1640s or in 1651.Peeter Boel at the Netherlands Institute for Art History His trip brought him to Genoa and Rome. In Genoa he stayed with fellow Antwerp painter and art dealer Cornelis de Wael who was a long-term resident that city and played a pivotal role in giving Flemish artists arriving in Genoa an opportunity to work. Boel later married de Wael's niece upon his return to Antwerp. Upon his return to Antwerp, where he was registered in the local Guild of Saint Luke as a wijnmeester (wine master) (a title reserved for the children of members of the guild) in 1650‚Äì51. He married Maria Blanckaert, daughter of the painter Jan Blanckaert. His wife's mother was a sister of the painters and art dealers Cornelis de Wael (whom he knew from Genoa) and Lucas de Wael. Two of the couple's sons Jan Baptist Boel the Younger and Balthasar-Lucas Boel became artists. Moor with a peacock, young woman with grapes and dead game By 1668-1669 he had moved to Paris where he formed part of the group of Flemish artists who had congregated around Charles Le Brun and resided at the H√¥tel Royal des Gobelins. The court painter (Premier peintre du roi) Charles Le Brun had been put in charge of the Gobelins Manufactory, the royal tapestry works created in 1663 as well as the decoration of the various new buildings being constructed for the King. To realize these projects Le Brun surrounded himself with a large group of artists including a number of Flemish artists such as the sculptor Gerard van Opstal and the painters Adam Frans van der Meulen, Abraham Genoels, Adriaen Frans Boudewijns and Peter van Boucle. As a resident of the H√¥tel Royal des Gobelins, Boel could practice his art without having to register with the local Guild of Saint Luke or the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture.Christian Michel, The Acad√©mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture: The Birth of the French School, 1648‚Äì1793, Getty Publications, 2018, pp. 47 On three occasions, his name appears in the Comptes des B√¢timents du Roi (Accounts of the Royal Buildings), including for providing designs for the Gobelins tapestry works.Walter Elisabeth Foucart, Pieter Boel, 1622 - 1674, peintre des animaux de Louis XIV, le fonds des √©tudes peintes des Gobelins, catalogue de l'exposition, Paris, Mus√©e du Louvre, 2001, Paris, √âditions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, (Exposition-dossier du d√©partement des Peintures ; 60), 2001 Boel was closely related to two Flemish artists, who also lived at the Gobelins: Adam Frans van der Meulen and Gerard Scotin, an engraver. In 1671 he was a witness to the wedding of Scotin. Van der Meulen's wife was the second witness. Scotin engraved a number of Boel's designs of animals and may also have been the publisher of engravings made by Boel himself. He was appointed peintre ordinaire (ordinary painter) by King Louis XIV in 1674. As the king's ordinary painter, Boel was commissioned to create 'paintings of various animals to be used in the tapestries of the Gobelins Manufactory.Madeleine Pinault S√∏rensen, 'Les animaux du roi: De Pieter Boel aux dessinateurs del'Acad√©mie royale des sciences,' in: Charles Mazouer, L'animal au XVIIe si√®cle: actes de la 1√®re Journ√©e d'√©tudes, 21 novembre 2001, du Centre de recherches sur le XVIIe si√®cle europ√©en, 1600-1700, Universit√© Michel de Montaigne-Bordeaux III, Universit√© Michel de Montaigne-Bordeaux III. Centre de recherches sur le XVIIe si√®cle europ√©en. Journ√©e d'√©tudes, Gunter Narr Verlag, 2003, pp. 159-184 He died on 3 September 1674 of that year. Adam Frans van der Meulen was a witness in the burial act. He was the teacher of his sons and David de Koninck. Work Arms and instruments of war Boel principally painted still lifes including flower still lifes, hunting still lifes, animal and fish still lifes, vanitas paintings and still lifes of weapons. He also painted some landscapes. Since most of his works are undated, it is difficult to establish a chronology for his work. Boel achieved a very high quality in his work. It is believed that a number of his compositions may have had their signature removed so that they could pass as works by Frans Snyders or his master Jan Fijt. Only recently a number of still lifes in museums, which were formerly given to Fijt, have been re-attributed to Pieter Boel.Pieter Boel, Fruit, Flowers and a Parrot in a Classical Landscape at Galleria d'Arte Lorenzelli Boel follows to a large extent the style of his teacher Jan Fijt, in particular in his smaller compositions featuring a hare or a few birds in the open air. Boel's compositions differ from Fijt's works in their restraint and the smoother and more controlled handling of the paint. His palette also differs from Fijt's in his preference for accents of blue, red and pink.Peeter Boel at site of Johnny Van Haeften Ltd. Still life with dead game and songbirds in the snow During his stay in Italy Boel got to know the work of the Genoese artist Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione and the still life painter Giuseppe Recco. He learned from these Italian masters to heighten the dramatic effect of his canvases by emphasizing the shadows. He also used red drapes in the background, a Baroque element par excellence, to enhance the atmosphere of his compositions.Pieter Boel, 'Still Life with Game, a Parrot, a Dog, a Monkey and Fruit' at The Golden Cabinet Boel is known to have collaborated with fellow Antwerp artists Erasmus Quellinus II and Jacob Jordaens, who painted the human figures in his compositions. Conversely, he also added still life elements to other artists' works. This is believed to be the case in the Portrait of the van de Werve Family (c. 1661, Auctioned at Sotheby's on 7 July 2005, London, lot 10) where Boel is believed to have added the still life on the left and the parrot in the portrait painted by Antwerp painter Pieter Thijs.Pieter Thijs, Portrait of the Van de Werve Family at Sotheby's Boel was accomplished in large-scale vanitas paintings depicting an abundance of fruit, flowers, game and precious objects. His masterpiece in this genre is the Vanitas Still Life in the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille. Study of camels Pieter Boel revolutionized animal painting. Whereas artists had contented themselves before with making static studies from stuffed animals, Boel drew and painted his animals from life in the menagerie at Versailles. He thus represented animals in their natural poses and devoid of any emblematic or similar preconceived notion of the animals. His way of portraying animals has been described as sympathetic with the animals. This was not in line with the prevailing view of animals as simple machines or beasts. His naturalism influenced a long line of great animal artists, from the painter Jean-Baptiste Oudry to the sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye. Boel was particularly adapt at rendering various textures, especially feathers. His animal studies were used as models for the animals appearing in the borders and foreground of a series of large tapestries, referred to as 'The Months' or 'The Royal Houses' (Maisons Royales) produced at the Gobelins tapestry workshop. Each of the tapestries represents a different royal residence. Conscious of the value of Boel's animal repertoire, the Gobelins workshop kept the entire set of Boel's painted and drawn studies numbering 81 in total. They represent mammals, birds, a tortoise, a lobster and a lizard. They are painted against a red or pink background. He painted the fur, plumage, paws and eyes of the animals with a free brush. The same animal is in some studies represented in different positions. The species are mixed in studies, but it is rare for furry animals and animals with plumage to be included in the same study. The French painter Fran√ßois Desportes copied several of his paintings and as a result, it was believed that the original drawings were by Desportes. It is only after it was confirmed that the originals had been made by Boel that Boel's reputation as an animal painter was re-established.Pieter Boel, Painter of Louis XIV's Animals - The collection of painted studies from the Gobelins Charles Le Brun used Boel's studies for his own works.

Life He was born at Alise-Sainte-Reine on the C√¥te-d'Or. He entered a small seminary at Plombi√®res-l√®s-Dijon in 1891 and was ordained 1901. He then worked as a parish priest. During the occupation of France during World War II, he took an active part in the French Resistance, helping with the escape of 5,000 prisoners of war from a camp at Longvic. He was arrested and condemned to death, but he was released because of his status. He continued organising operations, and was seriously wounded, but escaped interrogation by the Gestapo. In 1945, he was made a knight of the L√©gion d'honneur and was elected to the position of mayor of Dijon and to the French National Assembly. He remained the mayor of Dijon up to his death in 1968.

Alternately, some contend that German soldiers confiscated most of the region's red wine, so Kir converted a local brew of red wine and cr√®me de cassis into a combination of white wine and cr√®me de cassis, thus creating the drink.Kir cocktail An artificial lake built to the west of Dijon was named Lac Kir in his honour.

It is variously attributed to Silbermann and Frederici and was improved by Petzold and Babcock. The English and Viennese square pianos were built in many different designs, including within the action as well as general appearance, from roughly 1760. Because of the competitive industry and relative youth of the instrument design itself, experimentation ensued in the early years, creating a range of moderators (sound-altering effects) and other technical devices (knee levers; hand stops) not seen today. In London, the explosion of the trade is generally attributed to the maker Zumpe. The overwhelming popularity of his instruments was due to inexpensive construction and price. Over time, square pianos were built in larger sizes with more keys and a wider range; by the 1830s, square grand pianos predominated, with changes to their internal mechanisms and construction that produced larger sounds and used higher string tensions. Square pianos were the most popular keyboard instrument of the late 18th century, and the later square grand pianos enjoyed great popularity through the mid- and late-19th century. They were gradually replaced by upright pianos, which had a smaller footprint and larger sound. Square pianos were owned by everyone from George Washington and Thomas Jefferson to Marie Antoinette and Jane Austen. In the 1860s, more extensive metal frames were developed for square grand pianos, meaning that higher string tensions and therefore greater volumes were possible; however the size increases meant that the upright piano design was more economical, and so the upright replaced the square as the most common home instrument. Built in quantity through the 1890s in the United States, Steinway's celebrated iron-framed, overstrung square grands were more than two and a half times the size of Zumpe's wood-framed instruments that were successful a century before. Whilst many view square pianos as a 'proto-piano', because they do not have the range, volume or delicacy of touch available on modern instruments, they have a sound and playability all their own, and should be treated as a different instrument to the modern piano altogether.

The only work of long fiction solely written by Kesey after Sometimes a Great Notion (1964), Sailor Song depicts the lives of the residents of Kuinak, a small town in Alaska, thirty years in the future ‚Äì the 2020s.  Summary  Sailor Song is set in the near future in Kuinak, a small fishing town in Alaska. Earth is facing changes in climate and people are now living with the consequences of their environmentally destructive past. Kuinak is one of the last places on Earth that has not yet been impacted and that has managed to keep its natural beauty. The inhabitants live happily, undisturbed by the rest of the world and set in their ways. Among them lives Isaak \\"Ike\\" Sallas, the protagonist of the novel. A former eco-terrorist known as \\"the Bakatcha bandit,\\" Sallas had developed a drug habit and had spent some time in jail. Now in Kuinak, Sallas lives as a simple fisherman, avoiding most people and trying to escape his past. Together with his rasta-influenced friend Emil Greer, Sallas is employed by British shipowner Michael Carmody and Carmody's wife Alice, a Kuinak native. Life in Kuinak is soon disrupted by the arrival of Foxcorp executive, Nick Levertov, and his filming company who come to film a story about a native girl. The company hopes to involve all the townspeople, and eventually to transform Kuinak into an amusement park. Levertov is the son of Alice Carmody and he has a special interest in Sallas. The two men were cellmates in prison, and Levertov is now seeking revenge against Sallas. Some of the townspeople are easily persuaded by Levertov's promises of quick and easy riches, but Sallas and others are not so easily convinced.

H. Grabill Comanche was a mixed-breed horse who survived General George Armstrong Custer's detachment of the United States 7th Cavalry at the Battle of the Little Bighorn (June 25, 1876). Custer was a Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) at Little Big Horn. Biography The horse was bought by the U.S. Army in 1868 in St. Louis, Missouri and sent to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. His ancestry and date of birth were both uncertain. Captain Myles Keogh of the 7th Cavalry liked the gelding and bought him for his personal mount, to be ridden only in battle. He has alternatively been described as bay or bay dun. In 1868, while the army was fighting the Comanche in Kansas, the horse was wounded in the hindquarters by an arrow but continued to carry Keogh in the fight. He named the horse ‚ÄúComanche‚Äù to honor his bravery. Comanche was wounded many more times but always exhibited the same toughness. Myles Keogh 1872 On June 25, 1876, Captain Keogh rode Comanche at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, led by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer. The battle was notable as their entire detachment was killed. US soldiers found Comanche, badly wounded, two days after the battle. After being transported to Fort Lincoln, he was slowly nursed back to health. After a lengthy convalescence, Comanche was retired. In April 1878, Colonel Samuel D. Sturgis issued the following order: The ceremonial order inspired a reporter for the Bismarck Tribune to go to Fort Abraham Lincoln to interview Comanche. He \\"asked the usual questions which his subject acknowledged with a toss of his head, a stamp of his foot and a flourish of his beautiful tail.\\" His official keeper, the farrier John Rivers of Company I, Keogh's old troop, saved \\"Comanche's reputation\\" by answering more fully. Here is the gist of what the reporter learned (Bismarck Tribune, May 10, 1878): > Comanche was a veteran, 21 years old, and had been with the 7th Cavalry > since its Organization in '66.... He was found by Sergeant [Milton J.] > DeLacey [Co. I] in a ravine where he had crawled, there to die and feed the > Crows. He was raised up and tenderly cared for. His wounds were serious, but > not necessarily fatal if properly looked after...He carries seven scars from > as many bullet wounds. There are four back of the foreshoulder, one through > a hoof, and one on either hind leg. On the Custer battlefield (actually Fort > Abraham Lincoln) three of the balls were extracted from his body and the > last one was not taken out until April '77‚Ä¶Comanche is not a great horse, > physically talking; he is of medium size, neatly put up, but quite noble > looking. He is very gentle. His color is 'claybank' He would make a handsome > carriage horse... In June 1879, Comanche was brought to Fort Meade by the Seventh Regiment, where he was kept like a prince until 1887. He was taken to Fort Riley, Kansas. As an honor, he was made \\"Second Commanding Officer\\" of the 7th Cavalry. At Fort Riley, he became something of a pet, occasionally leading parades and indulging in a fondness for beer. Comanche died of colic on November 7, 1891, believed to be 29 years old at the time. He is one of only four horses in United States history to be given a military funeral with full military honors, the others were Black Jack, Sergeant Reckless and Chief. His remains were not buried but instead were sent to the University of Kansas and preserved, where the taxidermy mount can still be seen today in the university's Natural History Museum. Comanche was restored by museum conservator Terry Brown in 2005. Comanche at the University of Kansas Natural History Museum Comanche is often described as the sole survivor of Custer's detachment, but like so many other legends surrounding the Little Bighorn battle, this one is not entirely accurate. Other horses survived, but, in better condition after the battle, were taken as spoils of battle. As historian Evan S. Connell writes in Son of the Morning Star > Comanche was reputed to be the only survivor of the Little Bighorn, but > quite a few Seventh Cavalry mounts survived, probably more than one hundred, > and there was even a yellow bulldog. Comanche lived on another fifteen > years, and when he died, he was stuffed and to this day remains in a glass > case at the University of Kansas. So, protected from moths and souvenir > hunters by his humidity-controlled glass case, Comanche stands patiently, > enduring generation after generation of undergraduate jokes. The other > horses are gone, and the mysterious yellow bulldog is gone, which means that > in a sense the legend is true. Comanche alone survived.

The grounds are home to popular outdoor theatrical performances by The Chesapeake Shakespeare Company. In the 1930s the Institute was also known as \\"Warwick\\".  History  = Phelps era = The Patapsco Female Institute was chartered in January 1834. It was designed by architect Robert Cary Long, Jr. and built by Charles Timanus, who also built the Court House. It opened on January 1, 1837 as a girls' finishing school but was more designed under Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps to enable young ladies to be trained well enough to support themselves through teaching; the school remained in operation until 1891. Students at the school ranged from age 12 to 18, and at its peak enrollment there were 150 students attending the institute. Ellicott Mills (now Ellicott City) had both a boy‚Äôs school, Rock Hill, and a girl‚Äôs school, the Patapsco Female Institute (PFI). By 1840, neither was doing well. The Protestant Episcopal Bishop of Maryland, William R. Whittingham, had a personal interest in education and became involved in both schools. The Rev. Alfred Holmead transferred from Baltimore County to run Rock Hill and Bishop Whittingham, personally interviewed Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps to become the principal of the PFI. The Phelpses leased the school for seven years. John Phelps was listed as head of the family; in practice he was the business manager, taking care of the accounts, the grounds and buildings. Hinds, Grover, ‚ÄúHoward County Maryland; Family Letters‚Äù p.7 Under Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps, each student was charged a basic fee for room, board, washing, and basic instruction in English. Extra fees were charged for other subjects such as foreign languages, music and dance. The school eventually had several sources of income, including proceeds from state approved lotteries and $800 per annum for the admittance of lower income students who were to be trained as teachers. Maryland law stipulated that once the PFI had earned $15,000 from the lottery, the $800 annual state payment would cease. That happened in 1860. Hinds, p.35n. Each academic year was composed of two 22 week sessions beginning in May and November. Diplomas were conferred in April and October. Typically, 5 or 6 girls earned diplomas during each period. Certificates were also issued for completion of a particular subject, such as English. Hinds, p.7 Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps was very active in helping to find employment opportunities for students who were interested. Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps managed to find positions for some girls to live at a large house and teach a handful of girls. Sometimes, after being away gaining teaching experience and earning some money, a girl would return to the PFI to finish her education. Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps also had some teaching positions with a high turn over, where ex-students could have some teaching experience before moving on to seek employment elsewhere. Angeline Roys to her father, October, 1849, private collection Under Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps, when the school was not in session, and students had to remain, there was no organized activity for them. Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps always left town to visit relatives, her publishers or other personal business. John Phelps remained to keep the school open. He also arranged for the buildings to be cleaned and repaired. Hinds, pps. 14-18 A condition of Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps employment as principal of PFI was that she had to have an Episcopal priest on staff as chaplain. The Rev. Holmead was the first chaplain. In 1845, Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps replaced the Rev. Holmead and during her tenure there were a series of chaplains that she selected. After Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps left in 1856 the chaplains at PFI were usually the rectors of the local Episcopal Church, St Peter‚Äôs. Hinds, p. 31n The Phelpses signed a second seven year lease in 1848. John Phelps died in 1849. In 1855 Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps decided not to renew her lease for a third time. She stayed on for an extra year so that the school could be expanded and would be large enough to accommodate the students from the school run in Baltimore by her replacement, Robert Harris Archer. = Archer era = Robert Harris Archer (1812 - 1875) was a native of Harford County, Maryland. He was a graduate of West Point and resigned from the army in late 1837. In the 1840s he started a girl‚Äôs school in Baltimore. He ran girl‚Äôs schools the rest of his life. This Robert H. Archer is sometimes confused with his first cousin, Robert H. Archer (1820 - 1878). The other Robert H. Archer was the brother of Confederate general James Jay Archer and served in the Confederate Army, mostly on his brother‚Äôs staff. Hinds, pps. 33n, 50-51 The PFI under Robert H. Archer was different from the school run by Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps. The school was larger, the fees were higher, the girls had more freedom of movement, and more students stayed at the school when classes were not in session. Mr. Archer had programs year round for the girls. He was observed, for example, in July, 1857, with some of the girls at one of the spas in what was then western Virginia. The demographics of the student body were different. When Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps came to PFI she brought students with her from the Rahway school. Some had also attended the West Chester school. Many girls came from states north of Maryland. Besides the students she brought with her, the PFI‚Äôs existing student body was primarily from Maryland and Virginia. Mr. Archer through his family had southern connections. There was a much greater deep south representation in Mr. Archer‚Äôs student body in his school in Baltimore, which would continue at the PFI. With greater freedom of movement, staying at school year round, present for more years, 21, from 1856 -1877, Mr. Archer‚Äôs student body made a larger impression on the local community than Almira Hart Lincoln Phelps‚Äôs students. Hinds, p. 40n The Civil War was hard on the PFI and Mr. Archer‚Äôs finances. In an 1866 letter to a former student he wrote that the war almost ruined him and that he had $30,000 in outstanding pre-war debt due from the parents of students from the former Confederacy. The riots in Baltimore in the spring of 1861, due to the passage of Union regiments through Baltimore on their way to Washington, caused the school to be closed for a time. Hinds, pp. 50-51 In the fall of 1862, the 12th New Jersey Regiment camped near the school, and the PFI closed again. According to the chaplain of the PFI, at the time, Charles S. Spencer, the school re-opened in the spring of 1863. Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in Maryland, 1863, p.40 Archer‚Äôs first wife, and first cousin, Elizabeth Archer died in 1852. He married his second wife Mary Ringgold Archer (d. 1892) in 1858. By 1871 Archer was too ill to run the school. On July 10, 1871, the PFI board voted to transfer the balance of the third seven year lease to Archer‚Äôs wife, Mary Ringgold Archer. Mrs. Archer ran the school, along with Roberta Archer, Robert Archer‚Äôs daughter from his first marriage until the third lease expired in 1877. Mary and Roberta Archer transferred their school to Washington, D. C. The school was named the Archer Institute. Sykes Papers, Special Collections, Mississippi State University = End of the school = The PFI remained closed for a year as the board spent $10,000 on improvements in the physical plant. The PFI reopened in the fall of 1879. The school was run by Sarah N. Randolph (1839 - 1892). After her seven year lease expired in 1885, Sarah Randolph moved to Baltimore and ran a school there. Hinds p. 33n A September, 1885, advertisement for the PFI, shows that the school was open with Annie Matchett as Principal and Roberta Archer as Vice Principal. The two women were let out of their lease. Amanda Taylor became Principal as early as the 1886 - 1887 academic year. Report of the Commissioner of Education for the year 1886-87, p.554, GPO 1888 She could not make ends meet and the school closed. In 1891, the joint stock company was dissolved and the property was sold to James E. Tyson. Hinds p. 33n = Later history = The property was converted to a summer hotel called the Burg Alnwick Hotel. Fourteen years later, in 1905, it was purchased by a Miss Lilly Tyson and turned into a private home. In 1917, during the First World War, the building was called into service as a hospital. It was fitted with 50 beds to accommodate wounded veterans returning to the States. In later years, the building was used as a theater and again as a private residence. In 1938, the Howard County School board considered the site for a new school. The guests of the Burg Alnick Hotel used the grounds for shooting clay pigeons. In 1958, the property was sold to the final resident, Dr. Whisman for use as a nursing home. Howard county made a demand of the owner to remove all wood from the structure to prevent fires, including the roof, floors and paneling leaving the institute in a permanent state of ruins. The property was willed to Dr. Whisman's Alma- mater, the University of Cincinnati. In 1966, the County considered buying the eight acre property again as parkland from the University of Cincinnati using a news transfer tax for school and park projects. It was purchased for $17,500 by the County soon after. Since 1966 the building has been under the care of the 'Friends of the Patapsco Institute'; it has been stabilized and partially restored, and the grounds fenced in to limit public access. The county finance director declared the building unrestorable, but budgeted $1.7 million to convert the area around it to a park. The Patapsco Female Institute is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of a young woman named Annie Van Derlot who died of pneumonia while attending school there. While this claim is popular among ghost hunters, there is no record of an Annie Van Derlot ever attending the Institute.

This song is meant to be one of the reasons Ash believed they needed a fourth, female member. Originally, the track's high- pitched backing vocals were performed by drummer Rick McMurray, but the band were unsatisfied with them. The title of the song is a reference to fictional aircraft featured in the 1960s sci-fi series Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons. B-sides \\"Angel Interceptor\\" was released with two B-sides. \\"5am Eternal\\" is thought to be one of Ash's stranger songs. It starts with wind-up toy noises, and consists of lyrics, with blurry vocals, centred on strange sound effects, with synthesizer effects as well. \\"Gimme Some Truth\\" is a cover of the electro-pop version of the John Lennon song from his \\"Imagine\\" album, originally performed by John Lennon & The Plastic Ono Band. The Japanese version of the single contained 5 B-sides: \\"Girl From Mars\\" and \\"Cantina Band\\" from the \\"Girl From Mars\\" single, \\"Kung Fu\\" and \\"Luther Ingo's Star Cruiser\\" from the \\"Kung Fu\\" single, and \\"Gimme Some Truth\\" from the \\"Angel Interceptor\\" single. The Japanese release was sold with picture sleeves, lyrics and an obi- strip. Music video The video for the song was directed by Ash themselves, who put a high level of input into the video. It mainly consists of them playing in a yellow room, and occasionally messing about with stuff in the room. References to angels and rockets are occasionally made, such as a silhouette of an angel on a book at the start, and Tim reads a book on astrophysics.

Bollongier, Flowers in a glass vase, M√ºnchen, 1640. Bollongier was born and died in Haarlem. According to the RKD little is known of his early life. He became a member of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke in 1623, and in 1675 his younger brother Horatio was named as his beneficiary.Hans Bollongier in the RKD He was a specialist in bouquets of blooms. Paintings attributed to him that are not flower- or fruit still lifes are likely the work of his brother Horatio. He was an important influence on the later flower painters known as the monogrammist JF and Anthony Claesz II. He painted during a period of great productivity for Haarlem painters, during the decades after Karel van Mander published his Schilderboeck there. In Karel van Mander's book, there were a set of rules to follow to create good paintings and good drawings. Bollongier developed his own style and still observed all of these rules. His paintings were very popular, but his work was not regarded as such by contemporary Haarlem painters. As a genre, still life painting was considered inferior to historical allegories. His work today is considered part of the proof that Tulip Mania took place, although there is reason to believe that this is also just part of early Haarlem tourist propaganda.

Archeological excavations have found Native Americans lived near the shoals since prehistoric times, and Cherokees gathered there. As Europeans began settling the Trans-Appalachian frontier, the shoals proved strategic militarily, as well as shaped the economies of Tennessee and Kentucky. Today, the shoals are protected as a National Historic Landmark and are maintained as part of Sycamore Shoals State Historic Park.Carroll Van West, Sycamore Shoals State Historic Park. Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 28 June 2009.Polly Rettig and Hugh Lawing (form preparation), . 11 February 1976. Retrieved: 28 June 2009. PDF file. Explorer James Robertson (later a founder of Nashville) identified the alluring flatlands at Sycamore Shoals, known as the Watauga Old Fields, in 1770, and led a group of colonists to the area shortly thereafter. In 1772, the Watauga settlers established the Watauga Association, one of the first constitutional governments west of the Appalachian Mountains and the \\"germ-cell\\" of what would later become the state of Tennessee. In 1775, Richard Henderson and Daniel Boone negotiated the Treaty of Sycamore Shoals, in which Henderson's Transylvania Company purchased a large part of modern Kentucky and part of Tennessee from the Cherokee. The following year, the Watauga settlers successfully repelled one arm of a Cherokee group contesting land near Fort Watauga in a struggle that saw the creation of numerous stories surrounding figures such as Nancy Ward and John Sevier. In 1780, at the height of the American Revolutionary War, the frontier militia known as the Overmountain Men mustered at Sycamore Shoals as it prepared to march across the mountains en route to victory over British loyalists at the Battle of Kings Mountain. Location The Sycamore Shoals is located at just over upstream from the mouth of the Watauga River, and approximately downstream from the river's confluence with the Doe River and downstream from Wilbur Dam. While managed by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, the shoals are located within the municipal boundaries of Elizabethton. Beyond the shoals, the Watauga flows for another before entering its Boone Lake impoundment. History =Prehistory and early history= Excavations in the flats around Sycamore Shoals have uncovered evidence of significant habitation dating back to the Woodland period (ca. 1000 B.C. ‚Äì 1000 A.D.) and continuing sporadically through much of the Mississippian period (ca. 900‚Äì1600 A.D.). In 1567, a contingent of the Juan Pardo expedition passed through the Nolichucky River valley to the south and attacked a fortified Chisca village (the village was probably located between modern Jonesborough and Erwin).Charles Hudson, The Juan Pardo Expeditions: Explorations of the Carolinas and Tennessee, 1566‚Äì1568 (Tuscaloosa, Ala.: University of Alabama Press, 2005), pp. 26‚Äì29. By the late 17th century, the Mississippian-period inhabitants had largely vanished, and had been replaced by the Cherokee, who used Sycamore Shoals as a gathering place and hunting camp. By the 1760s, long hunters such as Julius Dugger and Andrew Greer were operating stations in the Watauga Valley in the vicinity of Sycamore Shoals. In 1769, William Bean, known traditionally as Tennessee's first permanent white settler, built a cabin at the confluence of Boone's Creek and the Watauga, about downstream from the Shoals. Around the same time, John Honeycut was operating out of a hut at the mouth of Roan Creek (about 20 miles upstream from the Shoals, now part of Watauga Lake).Samuel Cole Williams, Dawn of Tennessee Valley and Tennessee History (Johnson City, Tenn.: Watauga Press, 1937), pp. 338‚Äì348. Early hunters and explorers called the flats around Sycamore Shoals the Watauga \\"Old Fields,\\" as they were full of cane rather than trees, resembling once-cultivated fields that had for years lain fallow. =Settlement= Valentine Sevier monument at Sycamore Shoals; the Seviers arrived in the Sycamore Shoals area in 1773. In the Spring of 1770, James Robertson, possibly fleeing the turmoil created by the Regulator Movement in his home state of North Carolina, made an excursion into the Watauga Valley. He met John Honeycut, who pointed him to the Old Fields. Robertson later described the Old Fields as a \\"Promised Land\\" where fertile fields had already been cleared of the dense forest that dominated most lands in the region. Robertson planted crops and built a small cabin and corn crib on the north bank of the confluence to both the Watauga River and the Doe River\\"Early History of Carter County, 1760-1861\\", p.3. Frank Merritt. East Tennessee Historical Society, Knoxville, Tennessee. 1950. and then returned to North Carolina to notify family and friends of his discovery. In late 1770 or early 1771, Robertson returned to the Old Fields with sixteen families in tow. Robertson's settlement, which became known as the Watauga Settlement, grew quickly. The Watauga settlers believed (or claimed to have believed) that they were on lands that were part of the British domain, as the Watauga River is part of the watershed of the Holston River, the latter being established as the boundary between British and Cherokee lands by the 1770 Treaty of Lochaber. In 1771, however, a survey by John Donelson discovered that the Watauga settlements, along with the nearby Nolichucky settlement and an area east of Long Island of the Holston known as Carter's Valley, were on lands still claimed by the Cherokee. British Superintendent of Indian Affairs John Stuart thus ordered the Watauga settlers to vacate the valley and return to British territory.John Finger, Tennessee Frontiers: Three Regions in Transition (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 2001), pp. 43‚Äì64. =The Watauga Association= In 1772, the Watauga settlers, hoping to keep control of the land they had been developing, sent James Robertson and James Bean to Chota, where they negotiated a 10-year lease for the lands in the Watauga Valley. Being outside the authority of the Virginia and North Carolina colonial governments, the settlers lacked any official means of dealing with criminals and carrying out basic government functions, such as registering land deeds. Thus, in May 1772, the settlers drafted the Articles of the Watauga Association‚Äî one of the first written constitutions west of the Appalachian Mountains. The Watauga Association consisted of a five-man court that held sessions in a courthouse at Sycamore Shoals. The Association is often considered the root of state government in Tennessee, especially since many Wataugans went on to play prominent roles in the failed State of Franklin in the 1780s and in the Southwest Territory and Tennessee state governments in the 1790s. While later writers such as U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt romanticized the Watauga Association as a microcosm of the American Revolution,Williams, Dawn of the Tennessee Valley, p. 370. modern historians point out that the Wataugans never claimed to be independent of the British Crown, and tried to associate themselves with Virginia.W. Calvin Dickenson, Watauga Association. Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: 28 June 2009. =Treaty of Sycamore Shoals= The Wilderness Road and the Transylvania Purchase The defeat of the Shawnee in Lord Dunmore's War in 1774 emboldened land speculators in North Carolina, who believed much of what is now Kentucky and Tennessee would soon be under British control. One such speculator, Richard Henderson (1734‚Äì1785), learned from his friend Daniel Boone that the Cherokee were interested in selling a large part of their land on the Trans-Appalachian frontier, and Henderson quickly set up negotiations with Cherokee leaders. Between March 14 and March 17, 1775, Henderson, Boone, and several associates met at Sycamore Shoals with Cherokee leaders Attakullakulla, Oconastota, Willanawaw, Doublehead and Dragging Canoe, the latter of whom sought unsuccessfully to reject Henderson's purchase of tribal lands outside the Donelson line, and departed the conference vowing to turn the lands \\"dark and bloody\\" if settlers attempted to settle upon them. The rest of the negotiations went fairly smoothly, however, and the Treaty of Sycamore Shoals was signed on March 17, 1775. At the same conference, the Watauga and Nolichucky settlers negotiated similar purchases for their lands.Samuel Cole Williams, \\"Henderson and Company's Purchase Within the Limits of Tennessee.\\" Tennessee Historical Magazine Vol. 1 (1919) pp. 5‚Äì23. The Treaty of Sycamore Shoals, sometimes called the \\"Transylvania Purchase\\" (after Henderson's Transylvania Company, which had raised money for the endeavor), basically consisted of two parts. The first, known as the \\"Path Grant Deed\\", regarded the Transylvania Company's purchase of lands in Southwest Virginia (including parts of what is now West Virginia) and northeastern Tennessee. The second part, known as the \\"Great Grant,\\" acknowledged the Transylvania Company's purchase of some of land between the Kentucky River and Cumberland River, which included a large portion of modern Kentucky and northern Tennessee. The Transylvania Company paid for the land with 10,000 pounds sterling of trade goods. After the treaty was signed, Boone proceeded northward to blaze the Wilderness Road, connecting the Transylvania Purchase lands with the Holston settlements. =Fort Watauga= The reconstructed Fort Watauga The Transylvania Purchase and the accompanying Watauga and Nolichucky purchases violated the Royal Proclamation of 1763, and the Virginia and North Carolina assemblies rejected their legality. At the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in the months after the treaty was signed, the settlers aligned themselves with the colonies, whereas the Cherokee aligned themselves with the British. The Watauga and Nolichucky settlers organized themselves into the \\"Washington District\\" and formed a Committee of Safety, which set out to purchase arms and ammunition. The Committee also oversaw the construction of various forts, including Fort Caswell (later called Fort Watauga) at Sycamore Shoals.Finger, pp. 64‚Äì71. In July 1776, the Cherokee invaded the Nolichucky, Holston, and Watauga settlements. Although the settlers were chased out of Carter's Valley and the Nolichucky valley, the Holston settlers managed to thwart Dragging Canoe at the Battle of Island Flats (at modern Kingsport) on July 20. The following day, a Cherokee contingent led by Old Abraham of Chilhowee reached Fort Watauga. The Wataugans, led by John Carter, James Robertson, and John Sevier, were well-prepared, having been warned of the invasion by Nancy Ward. Ward also used her powers as a Cherokee Beloved Woman to spare the life of Lydia Russell Bean (wife of early settler William Bean), who had been captured during the invasion and had been sentenced to be burned at the stake. The Cherokee laid siege to Fort Watauga for about two weeks before retreating. A relief force led by William Christian arrived at Fort Watauga a few weeks later and attacked the Overhill towns. The following year, the Cherokee signed the Treaty of Long Island, ceding the Sycamore Shoals area to the United States. =The Overmountain Men= In 1776, the Washington District sent a petition to the North Carolina Assembly asking to be annexed. In November of that year, North Carolina agreed, and the district was admitted to the state as Washington County. Washington County militiamen, who along with the Holston and Southwest Virginia militiamen comprised a frontier militia known as the Overmountain Men, took part in various engagements throughout the war, including the Siege of Charleston (historian Samuel Cole Williams dubbed the siege's Washington County participants the first \\"volunteers\\" of Tennessee)Samuel Cole Williams, Lost State of Franklin (New York: Press of the Pioneers, 1933), p. 2. and the Battle of Musgrove Mill. In late 1780, Major Patrick Ferguson led an army of loyalists into the Appalachian Mountains to cover Cornwallis' invasion of North Carolina. Ferguson sent a message to the frontiersmen in Southwest Virginia and northeast Tennessee, ordering them to give up their arms or face destruction.Finger, pp. 84‚Äì88. On September 25, a force of 400 Virginians led by William Campbell, 240 Sullivan Countians led by Isaac Shelby, and 240 Washington Countians led by John Sevier gathered at Sycamore Shoals. After being supplied with food, money, and gunpowder by locals, the force marched across the Appalachian Mountains, linking up with several North Carolina and South Carolina militias along the way. On October 7, the Overmountain Men engaged and defeated Ferguson's loyalists at the Battle of Kings Mountain. The Overmountain Men suffered less than 100 casualties while killing 157 in the loyalist force (including Ferguson), wounding 163, and capturing another 698. The victory forced Cornwallis to temporarily abandon his invasion of North Carolina. Sycamore Shoals State Historic Park Sycamore Shoals, viewed from just off the Mountain River Trail In the 20th century, various entities began to acknowledge the importance of Sycamore Shoals in the history of Tennessee and the Trans-Appalachian frontier.

G. M. Ramsey recorded within his Annals of Tennessee as where Fort Watauga had once stood. In 1964, Sycamore Shoals was designated a National Historic Landmark, and it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. As part of the United States Bicentennial celebrations, the state of Tennessee decided to reconstruct Fort Watauga. The state purchased Sycamore Shoals, a small island within the shoals, and an undeveloped stretch of land along the south bank of the Watauga River for the reconstructed fort and the accompanying state park that would interpret it and maintain the shoals.Brian Compton, \\"Revised History of Fort Watauga,\\" pp. 14‚Äì18.

In 1980, the U.S. Congress appropriated funds for the creation of the Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail, which connects Sycamore Shoals with Kings Mountain National Military Park. Today, Sycamore Shoals State Historic Park hosts various annual reenactments regarding the siege of Fort Watauga and the mustering of the Overmountain Men. A walking trail follows the south bank of the Watauga, allowing easy access to the Sycamore Shoals, with various interpretive signs explaining the various historical events along the way. In recent years, the relatively low waters along the shoals (which are easy to wade across) have become a popular spot for fly fishing.Stanford Dailey, \\"Fly Fishing On the Watauga River in Winter.\\" Jonesborough Herald & Tribune, 4 February 2009.

The song was nominated for Best Original Song at the 56th Academy Awards; Streisand's longtime friend Donna Summer performed it during the ceremonies. The song peaked at No.26 at Billboard's Adult Contemporary.  Critical reception  Herald-Journal deemed it \\"forgettably gooey\\". Ottawa Citizen negatively compared the song to the Star Wars theme, postulating that only the most loyal Streisand fans would make a cognitive connection to the musical upon hearing the tune. Chicago Sun-Times deemed it \\"emotional\\". Newsweek International said it was a \\"gay anthem\\". However, for many Jews, and others who have lost a father, \\"Papa Can You Hear Me\\" is comparable to the treasured \\"My Yiddishe Momme\\", the moving lament for those who have lost a mother. Healing Times: A Personal Workbook created a therapeutic exercise based around the song. Covers Singer and pianist Nina Simone recorded the song in 1993 on her final album A Single Woman. Her father had died in the 1970s. Charlotte Church recorded the song as the 5th track on her 2001 album Enchantment. West End performer Meredith Braun recorded the song on her 2012 album \\"Someone Else's Story\\" In 2010, Glee did a cover in their episode 'Grilled Cheesus', sung by Lea Michele. Iranian songstress Helen Matevosian covered it in her studio album \\"Oghyanoose Khali\\" (\\"Empty Ocean\\"). In 2006 at her \\"Un Regard 9\\" concert in Paris, Lara Fabian, the Belgian-Canadian singer, paid homage to Streisand's voice then sang the song live. Popular culture A parody of the song is briefly sung near the end of the film Austin Powers in Goldmember when Goldmember is shocked by his tractor beam device and sings \\"Fahza can you hear me\\". The musical Spamalot features a song called \\"You Won't Succeed on Broadway (If You Don't Have Any Jews)\\" which refers greatly to Jewish influence on musicals. At a certain point during the song, the lead singer, Sir Robin calls out, \\"Arthur, can you hear me?!\\" The song was referenced in the BBC comedy series Beautiful People in Episode 2 of the first series, \\"How I Got My Nose\\". A brief excerpt is sung by the character of Debbie Doonan, as played by Olivia Colman. In the episode of The Simpsons \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\", Bart overhears Nelson singing the song while Nelson is staying with the family, as an ode to Nelson's missing father. In an episode of the show Will & Grace, Jack sings the song on separate occasions, as does Will in an earlier episode while visiting a therapist. In the \\"Grilled Cheesus\\" episode of Glee, Rachel sings the song for Burt Hummel (who is in a coma) and his son Kurt. Rachel sings the song outside (a nod to Yentl in the film) and later beside Burt's hospital bed, together with Mercedes, Quinn, Finn, and Carol, while Kurt watches from outside the room, feeling emotional. The instrumental version of the song is frequently used as background music in figure skating competitions. The song is featured several times in Deadpool 2 where a running joke is made out of the title character Deadpool noticing (initially while watching the film with his girlfriend), the \\"obvious\\" similarities between it and the song \\"Do You Want to Build a Snowman?\\" from the film Frozen. As he is dying towards the end of the film, Deadpool sings the song's chorus to his teammates.

For instance, a forecast may estimate the number of vehicles on a planned road or bridge, the ridership on a railway line, the number of passengers visiting an airport, or the number of ships calling on a seaport. Traffic forecasting begins with the collection of data on current traffic. This traffic data is combined with other known data, such as population, employment, trip rates, travel costs, etc., to develop a traffic demand model for the current situation. Feeding it with predicted data for population, employment, etc. results in estimates of future traffic, typically estimated for each segment of the transportation infrastructure in question, e.g., for each roadway segment or railway station. The current technologies facilitate the access to dynamic data, big data, etc., providing the opportunity to develop new algorithms to improve greatly the predictability and accuracy of the current estimations. Traffic forecasts are used for several key purposes in transportation policy, planning, and engineering: to calculate the capacity of infrastructure, e.g., how many lanes a bridge should have; to estimate the financial and social viability of projects, e.g., using cost‚Äìbenefit analysis and social impact assessment; and to calculate environmental impacts, e.g., air pollution and noise.  Four-step models  The Vicious Cycle of Predict and Provide Within the rational planning framework, transportation forecasts have traditionally followed the sequential four-step model or urban transportation planning (UTP) procedure, first implemented on mainframe computers in the 1950s at the Detroit Metropolitan Area Traffic Study and Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS). Land-use forecasting starts the process. Typically, forecasts are made for the region as a whole, e.g., of population growth. Such forecasts provide control totals for the local land use analysis. Typically, the region is divided into zones and by trend or regression analysis, the population and employment are determined for each. The four steps of the classical urban transportation planning system model are: * Trip generation determines the frequency of origins or destinations of trips in each zone by trip purpose, as a function of land uses and household demographics, and other socio-economic factors. * Trip distribution matches origins with destinations, often using a gravity model function, equivalent to an entropy maximizing model. Older models include the Fratar or Furness method, a type of iterative proportional fitting. * Mode choice computes the proportion of trips between each origin and destination that use a particular transportation mode (this modal model may be of the logit form). * Route assignment allocates trips between an origin and destination by a particular mode to a route. Often (for highway route assignment) Wardrop's principle of user equilibrium is applied (equivalent to a Nash equilibrium), wherein each driver (or group) chooses the shortest (travel time) path, subject to every other driver doing the same. The difficulty is that travel times are a function of demand, while demand is a function of travel time, the so-called bi-level problem. Another approach is to use the Stackelberg competition model, where users (\\"followers\\") respond to the actions of a \\"leader\\", in this case for example a traffic manager. This leader anticipates on the response of the followers. After the classical model, there is an evaluation according to an agreed set of decision criteria and parameters. A typical criterion is cost‚Äìbenefit analysis. Such analysis might be applied after the network assignment model identifies needed capacity: is such capacity worthwhile? In addition to identifying the forecasting and decision steps as additional steps in the process, it is important to note that forecasting and decision-making permeate each step in the UTP process. Planning deals with the future, and it is forecasting dependent.  Activity-based models  Activity-based models are another class of models that predict for individuals where and when specific activities (e.g. work, leisure, shopping, ...) are conducted. The major premise behind activity-based models is that travel demand is derived from activities that people need or wish to perform, with travel decisions forming part of the scheduling decisions. Travel is then seen as just one of the attributes of a system. The travel model is therefore set within the context of an agenda, as a component of an activity scheduling decision. Activity-based models offer other possibilities than four-step models, e.g. to model environmental issues such as emissions and exposure to air pollution. Although their obvious advantages for environmental purposes were recognized by Shiftan almost a decade ago, applications to exposure models remain scarce. Activity-based models have recently been used to predict emissions and air quality. They can also provide a better total estimate of exposure while also enabling the disaggregation of individual exposure over activities. They can therefore be used to reduce exposure misclassification and establish relationships between health impacts and air quality more precisely. Policy makers can use activity-based models to devise strategies that reduce exposure by changing time activity patterns or that target specific groups in the population.  Integrated Transport - Land Use Models  These models are intended to forecast the effect of changes in the transport network and operations over the future location of activities, and then forecast the effect of these new locations over the transport demand.  Per-driver models  As data science and big data technologies become available to transport modelling, research is moving towards modelling and predicting behaviours of individual drivers in whole cities at the individual level. This will involve understanding individual drivers' origins and destinations as well as their utility functions. This may be done by fusing per-driver data collected on road networks, such as my ANPR cameras, with other data on individuals, such as data from their social network profiles, store card purchase data, and search engine history. This will lead to more accurate predictions, enhanced ability to control traffic for customized prioritization of particular drivers, but also to ethical concerns as local and national governments use more data about identifiable individuals. While the integration of such partially personal data is tempting, there are considerable privacy concerns over the possibilities, related to the criticisms of mass surveillance.  Precursor steps  Although not identified as steps in the UTP process, a lot of data gathering is involved in the UTP analysis process. Census and land use data are obtained, along with home interview surveys and journey surveys. Home interview surveys, land use data, and special trip attraction surveys provide the information on which the UTP analysis tools are exercised. Data collection, management, and processing; model estimation; and use of models to yield plans are much used techniques in the UTP process. In the early days, in the USA, census data was augmented that with data collection methods that had been developed by the Bureau of Public Roads (a predecessor of the Federal Highway Administration): traffic counting procedures, cordon \\"where are you coming from and where are you going\\" counts, and home interview techniques. Protocols for coding networks and the notion of analysis or traffic zones emerged at the CATS. Model estimation used existing techniques, and plans were developed using whatever models had been developed in a study. The main difference between now and then is the development of some analytic resources specific to transportation planning, in addition to the BPR data acquisition techniques used in the early days.  Critique  The sequential and aggregate nature of transportation forecasting has come under much criticism. While improvements have been made, in particular giving an activity-base to travel demand, much remains to be done. In the 1990s, most federal investment in model research went to the Transims project at Los Alamos National Laboratory, developed by physicists. While the use of supercomputers and the detailed simulations may be an improvement on practice, they have yet to be shown to be better (more accurate) than conventional models. A commercial version was spun off to IBM,Transims and an open source version is also being actively maintained as TRANSIMS Open-Source.TRANSIMS Open-Source - HomeTransportation Analysis and Simulation A 2009 Government Accountability Office report noted that federal review of transportation modeling focused more on process requirements (for example, did the public have adequate opportunity to comment?) than on transportation outcomes (such as reducing travel times, or keeping pollutant or greenhouse gas emissions within national standards). One of the major oversights in the use of transportation models in practice is the absence of any feedback from transportation models on land use. Highways and transit investments not only respond to land use, they shape it as well.

Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station Pacific (NCTAMS PAC) provides operational direction and management to all Pacific Naval Telecommunication System users. In addition to this function, NCTAMSPAC manages, operates, and maintains Defense Communication System and Naval Telecommunication System assets, and offers a full range of ADP and information resource services, maintenance and repair, and communication/electronic and Defense Message System coordination to the United States Navy and other United States Department of Defense (DoD) activities in the Pacific.  History  = Before World War II= In May 1888, the United States established a coaling station to service the vessels of the Pacific Fleet in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. King David KalƒÅkaua had granted the U.S. the exclusive rights to enter and develop the area earlier that year. The U.S. Naval Radio Station in the Pearl Harbor area, the first government station in the islands, began operations on October 1, 1906. This radio station continued its operation until its deactivation in 1916. On March 3, 1915, the United States Congress passed an Appropriations Act that authorized $400,000 for the construction of a high-powered, long distance radio station at Pearl Harbor. In 1916, this new station, NPM, began operations at Hospital Point, Pearl Harbor. At 0230 on the morning of September 20, 1916, Captain Clark, the first Commandant of the 14th Naval District, sent the following message from the NPM to the Naval Radio Station, Long Beach, California: \\"SECRETARY OF THE NAVY, WASHINGTON, D.C. I HAVE THE HONOR TO SEND YOU THE FIRST THROUGH MESSAGE TO WASHINGTON, D.C., FROM PEARL HARBOR, HAWAII RADIO STATION, AND CAN REPORT SATISFACTORY PROGRESS OF THE PLANT. GEORGE R. CLARK SENDS.\\" A congratulatory message from the Secretary of the Navy arrived 33 minutes later. During the years following World War I, the naval activities in the Pearl Harbor area continued to expand. It soon became obvious that the future expansion of the radio station facilities in the area would not be practical. In 1933, a tract of land at Lualualei was set aside by the territory of Hawaii for use by the U.S. Navy. Seven self-supporting steel towers were erected to a height of at this new site for an antenna system for long wave radio transmitting. The site was officially activated in 1936, and by 1941 twelve transmitters were in operation. =World War II= With the arrival of the major United States Pacific Fleet units at Pearl Harbor naval base in 1939, it became increasingly clear that a new receiver and control station was needed. Therefore, a secluded spot at Wahiawa, some north of Pearl Harbor, was chosen and purchased by the Navy for approximately one million dollars. Construction began on the of land in 1940 and was scheduled to be completed in 1942. During that time, the station at Wahiawa was considered the most important of a number of Naval Radio and Air Stations being constructed as a part of a general expansion program. On December 7, 1941, a few minutes before 0800, several squadrons of Japanese aircraft passed over the Lualualei Transmitter Site on their way to bomb Pearl Harbor. The major Naval Radio Stations were strafed by these planes as they passed over, but casualties among the communications personnel were light; however, the radio stations themselves proved highly vulnerable to attack. Lualualei was located only from the shoreline and received its power over exposed land lines from the Hawaiian Electric Company, away. The radio facility at Wailupe, also along the seacoast, was deemed unprotectable. So, on the morning of December 10, it was decided to have all of the equipment at Wailupe moved to the new site at Wahiawa. Location of NCTAMS PAC at WahiawƒÅ, Hawaii This new site was an excellent receiving area and the best-protected radio station on the island. Men worked day and night to transfer operations to Wahiawa and on December 17 the relocation was completed without the slightest interruption in communications service. This location became known as the Naval Radio Station, Wahiawa. Shortly thereafter, the Security Group Unit was also moved from Heeia to Wahiawa. To improve naval communications in the Pacific area, a Communications Security Unit (COMSEC) was established at Wahiawa in 1942 under the management and control of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). Their purpose was to assist in a program of cryptographic security, message traffic control and message traffic analysis. It became apparent after the war that the naval communication facilities in Hawaii could never revert to their small pre-war status, but would have to continue in the role of \\"big business.\\" =After World War II= Shortly after the war, a committee was appointed by the CNO to make a survey of the facilities at Wahiawa and to make the appropriate recommendations concerning the location of the central point of radio communications. The committee decided that the central point should return to Pearl Harbor and that Wahiawa be relegated to a receiver site. However, in 1956, it was decided that insufficient space existed in the Pearl Harbor area to permit the continued expansion of communications facilities on Oahu. In addition, the various components were scattered throughout the Pearl Harbor complex which made the operation highly uneconomic and difficult to supervise. It was decided to relocate the central point back to the Wahiawa site. Because the requirements for rapid communications from the Department of the Navy to the fleet operational commanders had changed, the CNO authorized the activation of an additional teletypewriter system. This system, known as HICOM, was activated in 1957 and operated parallel to the existing communications channels. Later, the Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet (CINCPACFLT), established an additional parallel circuit known as the \\"Atomic Strike Coordinator Circuit.\\" It was determined that even more rapid communications would be necessary. Therefore, a new communications net, known as the \\"Naval Operation Net\\" was formed in 1959. At the same time, the Navy decided that the stations at Haiku and Heeia were no longer needed. The station at Heeia was turned over to the Marine corps Air Station at Kaneohe, while the Haiku station was placed in a non-operational status. The communication stations on Oahu underwent a consolidation in 1967. The message centers at Pearl Harbor (NAVSHIPYD), Makalapa (CINCPACFLT), Camp Smith (CINCPAC), Moanalua (FLEWEACEN), Secure Voice Pearl Harbor, and Consolidated Maintenance came under an Officer-in-Charge, which was known as NAVCOMMACTS Pearl Harbor. NAVCOMMACTS Pearl Harbor was a department of NAVCOMMSTA Honolulu who exercised administrative and operational control. The message center at Barbers Point also came under the control of NAVCOMMSTA Honolulu at the same time. The Makalapa Local Digital Message Exchange (LDMX) was activated in March 1973 by Vice Admiral G. C. Talle, Deputy CINCPACFLT. The system's activation marked a significant step forward by improving writer-to-reader speed of service, message formatting, routing indicator assignment, and message recall for CINCPACFLT. In September 1977, the NAVCOMMACTS Pearl Harbor was disestablished and NTCC Camp Smith, NTCC Makalapa, NTCC Pearl Harbor, Secure Voice, and Consolidated Maintenance became separate departments of NAVCOMMSTA Honolulu. Concurrently, NTCC Moanalua was disestablished and the communication functions were turned over to the Fleet Weather Center. In December 1977, NTCC Pearl Harbor was disestablished and absorbed into NTCC Makalapa in an ongoing effort to consolidate communications on Oahu. Subsequently, in February 1978, NTCC Makalapa, located in the basement of the CINCPACFLT headquarters building at Makalapa, became officially known as NTCC Pearl Harbor. The Commanding Officer of NAVCOMMSTA Honolulu transmitted the first message, via the LDMX system, in a ceremony marking the transformation of the CINCPAC Telecommunications Center at Camp H.M. Smith from Joint operation to Navy management in September 1973. In April 1976, the Naval Communications Station Honolulu was officially renamed Naval Communication Area Master Station, Eastern Pacific (NAVCAMS EASTPAC). The Navy's Satellite Facility at Wahiawa. On February 18, 1977, the Commanding Officer at NAVCAMS EASTPAC officially dedicated the new Super High Frequency (SHF) Satellite Facility at Wahiawa, the largest such facility of its kind. Concurrently, the Navy's Satellite Facility at Helemano was deactivated. NTCC Ford Island became a department of NAVCAMS EASTPAC in October 1983. On December 1, 1990, NAVCAMS EASTPAC and NARDAC Pearl Harbor merged to form the Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station, Eastern Pacific (NCTAMS EASTPAC). This merger took place to ensure that the Navy could meet the challenges of technological changes and advances. The command was again renamed on October 20, 1997. The new name, Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station, Pacific, better reflected the command's regional operating area.

History The current Cygnus Business Media is a composite business entity created through a series of acquisitions. =PTN Publishing= Originally established as a publishing company for Photographic Trade News in New York in 1937, PTN Publishing grew to house several photo magazines and titles in other industries. PTN acquired Johnson Hill Press in 1994. =Johnson Hill Press= Founded in Fort Atkinson, Wis., in 1957, Johnson Hill Press was the home of more than a dozen business- to-business magazines in agriculture, transportation, construction and home building when acquired by PTN. At the time of its acquisition, the primary requirement of retiring Johnson Hill CEO Jonathan Pellegrin was that PTN would allow the publications to remain in Wisconsin. =Cygnus Business Media= PTN Publishing itself would be acquired for a reported $98 million as the final piece in the creation of Cygnus Business Media in 1997. Formed a year before the acquisition, Cygnus was a creation of two former Turner Broadcasting System executives, World Championship Wrestling founder F. Blair Schmidt- Fellner and former Home Shopping Network CEO Gerry Hogan, along with investment firm Kelso & Co. =Expansion and reorganization = Fellner, Hogan and Kelso would steer Cygnus for three years before selling it to the newly formed Commerce Connect Media for a reported $275 million. Commerce Connect was formed with the intention of acquiring media properties in 1999 by CEO Paul Mackler and the ABRY Partners investment firm, Commerce Connect controlled Cygnus for most of the next decade. After an aggressive expansion in the early 2000s, Cygnus, in difficult financial straits, saw the departure of Cygnus Publishing president, Rich Reiff, in July 2006 and later that year the resignation of its CEO, Paul Mackler. Replacing Mackler were co-CEOs Carr Davis and Tony O‚ÄôBrien. Davis and O‚ÄôBrien focused Cygnus on rapid development of its interactive strategies, including massive overhauls of its website properties. With Cygnus still struggling financially after two years under their control, Davis and O‚ÄôBrien left the company late in 2008. Replacing them on an interim basis was Charlie Carnaval of Zolfo-Cooper who oversaw the attempted transfer of Cygnus by ABRY to its primary creditor, GE Capital, in an effort to avoid bankruptcy. During this time, Cygnus froze employee salaries and downsized, shuttering several magazines, including Photo Trade News and Modern Jeweler and laying off more than 10 percent of its staff. Cygnus‚Äô efforts to reorganize without bankruptcy failed in late 2009 when it was unable to reach an agreement with one of its two dozen creditors. Filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Cygnus emerged from its reorganization in one month with $120 million less debt (down from a reported $180 million to $60 million) and a new CEO, John French, the former CEO of Penton Media. Under John French's guidance, Cygnus Business Media was refocused into four initial affinity groups: Aviation, Construction, Public Safety and Agriculture. A fifth affinity, the Diversified Group for non-aligned publications, followed shortly thereafter.

Many, like Panhala Fort and Rajgad existed before him but others, like Sindhudurg and Pratapgad, were built by him from scratch. Also, the fort of Raigad was built as the place of throne, i.e., the capital, of Maratha Empire by Hirojee Indulkar on the orders of the Chhatrapati. This is the place where Shivaji was crowned and today also his Samadhi (shrine) stands in front of the Jagadishwar temple. These forts were central to his empire and their remains are among the foremost sources of information about his rule. The French missionary Father Fryer witnessed the fortifications of Gingee, Madras, built by Shivaji after its conquest, and appreciated his technical know-how and knowledge. Sindhudurg was built in order to control attacks by Portuguese and Siddhis on the coastal areas of the Maratha Empire. This fort is the witness of Shivaji's navy which was later led by Kanhoji Angre in times of Shivaji's grandson Shahu I, and came to glory. Also Shivaji built the forts of Colaba and Underi to control the activities of the Siddhis in Arabian Sea. At the time of Underi's construction British opposed a lot and stood with their warships in the sea to obstacle the material being supplied for the construction of the fort. But for their surprise the material required for construction was being supplied with the help of small boats in night. The hill fort of Salher in Nashik district was at a distance of from the hill fort Gingee, near Chennai. Over such long distance, hill forts were supported by seaforts. The seafort, Kolaba Fort, near Mumbai, was at a distance of from the seafort Sindhudurg. All of these forts were put under a havaldar with a strong garrison. Strict discipline was followed. These forts proved useful during Mughal-Maratha wars. Notable features of Shivaji's forts include: *Design changes with the topography and in harmony of the contour, no monotony of design. *No ornate palaces or dance floors or gardens. *No temple complexes. *Sanskritization of fort names. *Community participation in the defense of forts *Distinct feature of forts like double line fortification of Pratapgad, citadel of Rajgad. *Foresight in selection of sites.

Homeland Defense Stocks. It is closely related to the concepts of biological warfare, chemical warfare and entomological warfare, except carried out by non-state parties. A hostile attack, towards an agricultural environment, including infrastructures and processes, in order to significantly damage national or international political interests. Nomenclature The terms agroterrorism, along with agroterror and agrosecurity, were coined by veterinarian pathologist Corrie Brown and writer Esmond Choueke in September 1999 as a means to spread the importance of this topic. The first public use of agroterrorism was in a report by Dr. Brown which was then reprinted in a front page article of The New York Times on September 22, 1999 by reporter Judith Miller. Dr. Brown's article in 2,000 for Emerging Diseases of Animals (American Society for Microbiology) made these words a permanent fixture, and they soon ended up as part of everyday use. The Oxford Dictionary now recognizes the word agroterroism and its derivatives. An initial debate by Dr. Brown and Mr. Choueke involved the spellings agriterror vs. agroterror. The spelling with the \\"o\\" won, as it was closest to bioterrorism and thus would be easier to remember.

Career Steele began his playing career as a goalkeeper at Newcastle United in 1972, where he was part of the squad that won the Anglo-Italian Cup and won caps at England under-18 level. He then joined Peterborough United, and established himself as first-choice 'keeper, setting a record for most consecutive league appearances (124). That record would later be beaten by another Peterborough player, George Boyd (144). He does however, continue to hold the most consecutive appearances in all competitions for the Posh (148). He later joined Brighton & Hove Albion, Watford, and Derby County, winning five promotions in 12 years with those clubs. In 1988, he retired to run a pub, before establishing Eric Steele Coaching Services, which provided goalkeeping coaching to Manchester City, Leeds United, Derby County, and Barnsley, as well as working overseas in Australia, Switzerland, Norway, Germany and the USA. Steele was at Huddersfield Town as goalkeeping coach and left at the end of the 1997/98 season when he joined Derby County when they came calling again in 1998, and he spent four years coaching there before being appointed goalkeeping coach at Aston Villa in 2001. Steele left his post at Aston Villa in 2006. In 2006 Eric visited Australia, where he worked with junior and senior goalkeepers in Victoria and Perth. He worked with well-known coaches and helped improve Australian goalkeepers. In 2007, he became the new Manchester City goalkeeping coach, following the departure of Tim Flowers to Coventry City as assistant to Iain Dowie. Steele left his job at City on 27 June 2008 after being part of the backroom team under managers Stuart Pearce and Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson. Mark Hughes, who had left Blackburn Rovers to take charge of Manchester City, brought with him Kevin Hitchcock, replacing Steele as goalkeeping coach. Paul Ince soon appointed him as goalkeeping coach at Blackburn Rovers. However, just weeks after joining Blackburn, Steele attracted the attention of Manchester United, who had been in search of a new goalkeeping coach since Tony Coton had been forced to retire through injury. In preparation for Steele's departure, Blackburn signed Bobby Mimms from Wolverhampton Wanderers as their new goalkeeping coach. Manchester United confirmed the signing of Steele on 4 August. Steele left United after David Moyes took over as manager in 2013.

Except for the largest, which are in hydrostatic equilibrium, natural satellites (moons) differ from small Solar System bodies not in size, but in their orbits. The orbits of natural satellites are not centered on the Sun, but around other Solar System objects such as planets, dwarf planets, and small Solar System bodies. Some of the larger small Solar System bodies may be reclassified in future as dwarf planets, pending further examination to determine whether or not they are in hydrostatic equilibrium. The orbits of the vast majority of small Solar System bodies are located in two distinct areas, namely the asteroid belt and the Kuiper belt. These two belts possess some internal structure related to perturbations by the major planets (particularly Jupiter and Neptune, respectively), and have fairly loosely defined boundaries.

Its area is 58.98 km2. and it has a population of 1,700 (). Island morphology The highest peak of ≈†olta is the summit Vela Stra≈æa which is 236 metres high. On the north-eastern coast of the island there are the large bays of Rogaƒç and Neƒçujam. In the western part of the interior of ≈†olta there is a field approximately long and wide. Satellite image of ≈†olta Economy The economy of the island is based on vineyards, olives, fruit, fishing and tourism. While the main settlements (Grohote, Gornje Selo, Srednje Selo, Donje Selo) are inland, the main fishing centres are Maslinica, which is exposed to only north-westerly winds, making it a good shelter for smaller boats. Rogaƒç is the main port and Neƒçujam the centre of the island‚Äôs tourism. =Viticulture - Dobriƒçic ancestor of Zinfandel= Viticulture exists on the island since antiquity. The most famous autochthonous red wine variety is the Dobriƒçiƒá. According to DNA analysis, this variety is one of the original varieties of the American Zinfandel along with the Ka≈°telanski from the Split area.N.N.: A tradition of olives, culture and wine. In: Discover ≈†olta, 2012, p 3‚Äì4. The American wine pioneer Mike Grgich from Croatia brought the varieties to California. The Split noble family of the father of Croatian literature, Marko Maruliƒá (1450-1524), who also lived on ≈†olta, was among the first to cultivate the Dobriƒçic intensively. In the 19th century viticulture in ≈†olta suffered severe setbacks. A trade agreement between Austria and Hungary with Italy allowed low-cost Italian wines to be imported duty-free. Diseases such as downy mildew and phylloxera reduced the stocks. The best qualities of national importance were created in the 1870s and 80s by Pietro degli Alberti from Porto Oliveto di Solta (Maslinica). At the Vienna World Fair in 1873 he received an honorary prize. At the Triester exhibition in 1882 he received a gold medal. Even in the interwar period there was intensive viticulture. As a result of the communist economy there is still no larger winery. The cultivation is almost only for the own use. Some smaller wine growers, e.g. in Donje Selo, sell wine directly. It is also available at the market in Grohote. A large vineyard (on state leasehold land) was laid out for the first time again around 2015 on a hill on the road to Maslinica.

(Price list for cadastral extracts) (Austrian map with place names and field names) The property tax structure of the Austrian-Hungarian administration was based on \\"Fractionen\\". The local parish of ≈†olta was divided into the cadastral community Grohote, Donje-Selo, Gornje-Selo and Srednje-Selo, i.e. under the Croatian place names. However, ≈†olta was no longer fully recorded in the land register by the Austrian administration. For parts of the island there is only the cadastre, i.e. site plans of the real estate, in which ownership and usage rights are not directly registered. This makes real estate transactions sometimes difficult. As a result of the communist economy there is still no larger winery. They are cultivated almost exclusively for their own needs. In Donje Selo, for example, wine can be bought directly from some smaller winegrowers. It is also available at the market in Grohote. A large vineyard (on state leasehold land) was laid out for the first time again around 2015 on a hill on the road to Maslinica. The Telegraph arrived late at ≈†olta. In 1874, the k.k.

It was the seat of the Bishops of Aire until the diocese was abolished in 1801 and again from 1822 when the diocese was restored; in 1857 it was renamed the Diocese of Aire and Dax. In 1933 the bishop moved to Dax, making Dax Cathedral his seat, when the cathedral at Aire became a co-cathedral. It was listed as a national monument in 1906.Base M√©rim√©e: Cath√©drale, Aire- sur-l'Adour History The cathedral is situated in the lower town, where the bishops used to live. In origin a structure of the 11th and 12th centuries, it was subject to much alteration between the 14th and 17th centuries and its present appearance shows a variety of styles. The great rotunda on the chevet is especially noticeable. From the 12th century there remain three bays and an apse. The severe 13th century fa√ßade, surmounted by a tower with a slate roof, has a simple vaulted portal with a pointed arch. The present sacristy is in origin a chapter house of the 14th century, with Gothic vaulting supported by central pillars; this is of Tolosan construction and evokes the \\"palm trees\\" of the Dominicans.. The nave has ogive vaults of the 14th century. The quire is flanked by four apsidioles giving onto the transept. The organs and side- altars are of the late 18th century, as are the stalls, the high altar and the rest of the handsome furnishings. While the apse is being extended towards the park, the orangery, a stone building of the 17th century, is being used for temporary exhibitions. The overall dimensions of the cathedral are 48 metres in length, 8 metres in width across the nave and 15 metres in height to the highest point of the vault.

Also known as Siqit, it is a dim, narrow gorge (in some points no more than wide) and winds its way approximately and ends at Petra's most elaborate ruin, Al Khazneh (the Treasury). A wide valley outside leading to the Siq is known as the Bab as-Sƒ´q (Gateway to the Siq). Description The arch, destroyed by an earthquake in 1896, drawn in 1839. From The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia Unlike slot canyons such as Antelope Canyon in the American Southwest, which are directly shaped by water, the Siq is a natural geological fault split apart by tectonic forces; only later was it worn smooth by water. The walls that enclose the Siq stand between in height. The entrance to the Siq contains a huge dam, reconstructed in 1963 and again in 1991, designed to bar the mouth of the Siq and reroute the waters of Wadi Musa. The dam is a fairly true reconstruction of what the Nabataeans did to control Wadi Musa between the 1st century BC and the beginning of the 1st century AD. The entrance also contains the remnants of a monumental arch, of which only the two abutments and some hewn stones of the arch itself have survived. The arch collapsed in 1896 following an earthquake, but its appearance is known from the lithographs of Matthew Boulby and David Roberts. The Siq was used as the grand caravan entrance into Petra. Along both walls of the fissure are a number of votive niches containing baetyli, which suggest that the Siq was sacred to the Nabatean people. In 1998, a group of statues were uncovered when digging was conducted to lower the road by more than six feet. Although the upper part is greatly eroded, it is still possible to recognise the figures of two merchants, each leading two camels. The figures are almost twice lifesize. Along the Siq are some underground chambers, the function of which has not yet been clarified. The possibility that they were tombs has been excluded, and archaeologists find it difficult to believe that they were dwellings. The majority consensus is that they housed the guards that defended the main entrance to Petra.  3D documentation  The Zamani Project spatially documented the Siq and most parts of Petra Archaeological Park in 2011-2014, as part of the UNESCO Siq Stability Project. The non-profit organisation specialises in 3D digital documentation of tangible cultural heritage, and seeks to increase awareness and knowledge of heritage in Africa and beyond. The data generated by Zamani are used for research, education, restoration, conservation and as a record for future generations.

It is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The cemetery is situated near the junction of 25th Street and Tamarind Avenue between I-95 and U.S. Route 1. The site is the location in which 674 bodies of African Americans or those of an unknown race were buried following the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane, while most of the white victims of the storm received a proper burial at Woodlawn Cemetery due to segregation laws. Established in 1913, the property of the pauper's cemetery currently includes approximately of land. Although the site is located at the southwest corner of 25th Street and Tamarind Avenue, 25th Street was paved above the northern portion of the mass grave in the 1950s, unearthing a number of bodies in the process. After the 1928 hurricane, the bodies buried at that location became mostly forgotten by the public. The city of West Palm Beach sold the land and it changed ownership several times into the 1980s. Beginning in 1991, a movement to convince the city of West Palm Beach to repurchase the property began, which succeeded in December 2000\\\\. On September 12, 2002, it was added to the US National Register of Historic Places. Design The Hurricane of 1928 African-American Mass Burial Site is located in West Palm Beach, Florida, at the southwest corner of the intersection of 25th Street and Tamarind Avenue. Originally, the pauper's cemetery was composed of approximately , but portions of the property were sold. Additionally, 25th Street was redirected to pass through the cemetery. The property today contains about of land. The property is dotted with several pillars reading \\"1928\\" and a historical marker, which was erected in 2003. There are also sidewalks, trees, and benches. The bodies were buried in two layers in a now completely fence-enclosed area, which is located near the northeast corner of the pauper's cemetery, close to 25th Street and about west of Tamarind Avenue. However, the parcel of land containing the bodies extended farther north prior to the 25th Street, which moved southeastward-to-northwestward until becoming an east-to-west street in the 1950s. A larger fence, approximately , surrounds the inner fence and mass burial parcel. History =Establishment of the cemetery and 1928 hurricane= In 1913, the city of West Palm Beach set aside land for cemeteries. Three acres each were reserved for a Palm Beach County pauper's cemetery, a city pauper's cemetery, a pest house, and a pauper's house - in total. The city pauper cemetery, the future location of the mass burial site, was located at the southwest corner of Tamarind Avenue and 25th Street, which moved northwest to southeast at the time. In 1917, the county established a pauper's cemetery near modern-day intersection of 45th Street and Australian Avenue. However, a portion of the property was sold to a slaughterhouse in 1917. The 1928 Okeechobee hurricane caused at least 2,500 deaths, most of which were migrant, black farmer workers around Lake Okeechobee. Due to racial segregation at the time, the coffins provided were used for the white victims, most of whom received a proper burial at Woodlawn Cemetery in West Palm Beach. The bodies of the black people who were killed, and some of those whose race could not be identified, were disposed of by other means. Some were burned in funeral pyres, while many were placed into mass graves, including about 1,600 in Port Mayaca, 674 at the pauper's cemetery in West Palm Beach, at least 22 in Miami Locks (now known as Lake Harbor), 28 in Ortona, and 22 in Sebring. There were also unconfirmed reports of bodies buried in Loxahatchee. After the burials were complete, then-Mayor of West Palm Beach Vincent Oaksmith proclaimed an hour of mourning on October 1 for those who died during the storm. A funeral service was hosted by several local clergymen. Roughly 3,000 people attended, including educator and civil rights activist Mary McLeod Bethune. A memorial was placed at Woodlawn Cemetery in memory of the victims of the storm, but no such marker was placed at the pauper's cemetery. =After the hurricane= Those buried were largely forgotten, despite reports of human remains resurfacing over the years, including during the rerouting of 25th Street in the 1950s, which resulted in the unearthing of several bodies. In 1957, the city of West Palm Beach sold a section of the burial grounds to a sewage disposal plant, but the property changed ownership again in the 1980s when the city exchanged the land for property on 23rd street, just to the south of the grounds and where a church was located. After some deed restrictions were lifted in 1985, the church sold the land to Palm Beach Exterminating owner Bernard Kolkana, who was planning the construction of a warehouse on the property. Unaware of the mass burial, Kolkana purchased the land for $175,000 in 1987, a year before his son, Jim, bought the land for $230,000. The historical marker added in 2003 The public remained mostly unaware of mass burials on the site until the 1990s, until the Sankofa Society conducted a well-publicized blessing ceremony in 1991. Kolkana refused to sell or donate the land back to the city of West Palm Beach, but halted any plans for construction on the property. In 1992, city work crews located human remains on the property using a backhoe. The bones were reburied, but their locations were marked. Resident Robert Hazard established the Storm of '28 Memorial Park Coalition in 1999 as a non-profit organization used to reacquire the land and solicit donations for a memorial complex. The complex was originally intended to include an educational center and a museum about African-American pioneers and migrant farm workers, at a cost of approximately $6.1 million. Organizations such as the Sankofa Society proposed a less sophisticated plan of erecting an information wall and a large marble headstone, at a far less expensive cost of about $43,000. In 2000, a Miami- based technology company was hired by the city of West Palm Beach to conduct a ground-penetrating radar survey covering a by area. The team performed the assessment with a subsurface interface radar, which was used to determine the locations of the bodies. The report of the survey indicated that a by trench was dug for disposal of the bodies, however the extension of 25th street \\"unearthed random bodies from the old pauper's cemetery, and it ran right through the north end of the mass grave trench.\\" Additionally, according to the survey, the bodies were buried in two layers. =Re-acquisition by the city of West Palm Beach= City Commissioner Alfred Zucaro urged then-West Palm Beach mayor Joel Daves in September 2000 to reacquire the land using eminent domain. This would allow the city to receive the land for its appraised value of only $1,000 without consent from Kolkana. On September 11, four of the five city commissioners - Jim Exline, Ike Robinson, Bill Moss, and Zucaro - voted in approval of eminent domain after failures to negotiate with Kolkana and accusations of racism. The fifth commissioner, Mary Brandenburg, was absent. The city commissioners reversed their positions December 11, 2000, after negotiating with Kolkana to purchase the land for $180,000. Thereafter, plans for construction of a memorial began. The site was designated a US National Registered Historic Place on September 12, 2002. During the 75th anniversary of the storm's landfall in September 2003, a historical marker was added by the City of West Palm Beach.

Famous for its Cluniac inspiration and its Romanesque sculptures by Gislebertus it is a highlight in Romanesque art in Burgundy and it is the seat of the Bishop of Autun. The Bishop of Autun set forth the construction of St. Lazarus Cathedral as a result of the large movement of pilgrims travelling to Vezelay as they progressed on the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela. Due to social practices that involved pilgrims venerating the relics of saints in this period, the Bishop of Autun ordered the creation of a larger cathedral to house the relics and accommodate the influx of pilgrims into Autun. The column capitals and main fa√ßade of the church are embellished with realistic sculptures carved by Gislebertus. The artwork is a means of teaching the masses of Christian ethics with dramatic scenes of heaven and hell. Other features include a rare tympanum signed by Giselbertus of Autun. The Autun Cathedral is a magnificent display of Romanesque Art and Architecture. The sculptures created by Gislebertus successfully integrate biblical iconography relating to the new and old testament's with ease and amazing artistic ability. The size and quality of the tympanum of the Last Judgment, and the lintel of the Temptation of Eve are impressive and exquisitely detailed pieces of art. The Autun Cathedral remains on the highest elevation in Autun, France and is considered a fine example of the French Romanesque. History =Saint Nazaire Cathedral= The first cathedral of Autun was built from the 5th century onwards (later dedicated to Saint Nazarius (St. Nazaire), as it held relics of Saints Nazarius and Celsus) and was several times refurbished and enlarged. In about 970 it obtained from Marseille some of the relics of Lazarus of Aix, in the belief that they were relics of Lazarus of Bethany, the friend of Jesus. These became an object of pilgrimage and the crowds became too great for the cathedral building. The Bishop of Autun, Etienne de B√¢g√©, therefore decided in about 1120 on the construction of a new cathedral as a pilgrimage church and for the better veneration of the relics. The new cathedral was allotted a site to the north of the earlier cathedral of Saint Nazaire, of which some remains may still be seen. =Saint Lazare Cathedral= Front fa√ßade The Autun Cathedral at night Work on the new cathedral of Saint Lazarus (St. Lazare) began in around 1120 and advanced rapidly enough for the building to be consecrated in 1132. It was mostly finished by 1146, when the relics of Lazarus were translated from the old cathedral. The Tomb of Lazarus, the shrine of the relics, was constructed in the choir in 1170-1180.destroyed in 1766 The narthex or portico was not completed until the very end of the century. St. Lazare Cathedral stands in the highest and best fortified corner of the town, and through external modifications that have been applied to the building the appearance has been much altered by the addition of a Gothic tower, a spire and side chapels in the 15th century. The cathedral still contains a highly Romanesque appearance on the interior. In 1462, Bishop Jean Rolin had a new belfry built in replacement of the Romanesque one that was unfortunately destroyed by a bolt of lightning. The inspiration of the new building, both in layout and decoration, was Cluniac. The designs were the work of the bishop Etienne de B√¢g√©, who was particularly influenced by the Cluniac abbey of Paray-le-Monial. St. Lazare Cathedral was consecrated in 1132. For a number of years after 1146 the two cathedrals operated in tandem, with Saint Lazare as the summer cathedral (from Easter to All Saints' Day) and Saint Nazaire as the winter cathedral. The cathedral was finished in 1146, (with the exception of the porch which was added a few years later); Abb√© Grivot writing in his excellent guide to the cathedral explains that the interior of the building is not Gothic, as there are no crossed diagonal ribs, but Romanesque vaulting as was used at Cluny III. Saint Lazare was eventually confirmed as the one cathedral of Autun in 1195. From 1793 until 1805 it was home to the famous painting Madonna of Chancellor Rolin by Jan van Eyck, now in the Mus√©e du Louvre.  Architecture = Interior = Saint Mary Magdalene, sculpture from the old tomb of Saint Lazarus at the Autun Cathedral, now at Autun's Mus√©e Rolin The interior has a nave and two aisles, divided by massive columns with longitudinal carvings punctuated with beautifully decorated Romanesque capitals. The plan of the cathedral has a narthex of two bays topped by two towers, followed by a 7-bay nave flanked by side aisles and a transept with the tower surmounting cross. The twin flanking towers date from the 19th century. The nave elevation is composed of three levels: grand arcade, triforium and clerestory, each marked by a cornice. The three story elevation of St. Lazare was made possible by the use of pointed arches for the nave. Each nave bay is separated at the vault by a transverse rib. Each transept projects to the width of two nave bays and the west entrance has a narthex which screens the main portal. The triforium base is decorated with a frieze of rosettes and consists of three blind arches. The pointed arch has been debated to be adapted from Islamic Art architecture where it had been used for some time. Many of the historiated capitals that adorn the columns within St Lazare were carved by Gislebertus that include fine representations of the Flight into Egypt and Adoration of the Magi. The capitals adorn columns along the nave. What makes St. Lazare a masterpiece of Romanesque art is the quality of Gislebertus' sculpture that appears on dozens of capitals in the nave and chancel including scenes from the Bible carved in stone in a very particular style. = Exterior = The Cathedral of St. Lazare has a ground-plan in the form of a Latin cross, with an aisled nave, a plain transept and a three-stage choir with a semicircular end. The Gothic spire dates from the 15th century although the west towers were rebuilt in the 19th century, based on the Romanesque style of Paray-le-Monial.  Capitals  St. Lazare Cathedral contains some of the most spectacular Romanesque capitals done by Gislebertus in its nave and choir. Gislebertus created capitals that used the tendrils of the actual Corinthian capital to create an architectural frame for the narrative of the story to develop. The capitals of the portal are carved with biblical and traditional scenes. One depicts St. Jerome removing a thorn from a lion's paw; another shows the Presentation of Christ. Over 60 capitals within St. Lazare are known to be the works of Gislebertus and include other biblical narratives including Samson, the prophet Habakkuk, Cain & Abel, St. Peter, as well as capitals containing Christ and the Apostles. The intricate carvings that make up the capitals by Gislebertus vividly display the narrative it is meant to be picturing. Owing to a near- collapse in the 19th century, the capitals under the central tower were replaced by replicas; the originals can be viewed up close in the upstairs chapter house (entrance to the right of the choir). Among the scenes on the capitals in the chapter house are the Flight into Egypt, God Questioning Cain, the Hanging of Judas, and the Adoration of the Magi. = Three Magi Capital = Gislebertus is conceiving the capitals through liturgical drama. This capitals depicts the angel's attempt to wake the three sleeping magi. The angel points to the star in attempt to have the three magi to follow the star. The narrative of the three magi extends along the columns in the nave. Each capital shows great detail and a vivid depiction of the story it is telling. = Suicide of Judas Capital = When Judas realizes what he has done to Jesus he repents. In his horror he hangs himself, unable to bear disobeying his master. The capital shows Judas with an open face shown in a grimace with his tongue out. The capital also depicts demons pulling Judas up and hanging him. Gislebertus actually uses one of the tendrils of the Corinthian capital in an innovative way to demonstrate what was used to hang Judas. The fire hair of the devils represents a reference to hell. Gislebertus displays a strong didactic image within the Suicide of Judas capital. = The Flight to Egypt Capital = The Flight into Egypt capital by Gislebertus is located on the column opposite of the Adoration of the Magi narrative. The Flight into Egypt capital depicts Mary with a calm demeanour showing us her child as she sits upon the pony. She seems to be floating on the donkey rather than sitting on him, a position similar to the enthroned Madonna and Child. = Vices and Virtues Capital = This capital depicts Charity defeating Greed and Patience conquering Wrath. Such a carving would remind parishioners that evil intentions must be overcome if purity of heart and life is to prevail. This Romanesque capital would provide a didactic function for pilgrims that were illiterate and unable to read the script. The vice and virtues capital contains acanthus leaves on the background with Charity and Patience stepping upon the \\"vices\\" which are demonic creatures.  The Temptation of Eve  The bas-relief The Temptation of Eve. Gislebertus' Temptation of Eve (French: La Tentation d'√àve) was originally the lintel of the north door of the cathedral. It is stated that the Temptation of Eve was created around the 1130s at the same time in which the Last Judgment and the narrative capitals were made. This large sculpture is now displayed in the Mus√©e Rolin, Autun, France.  The Last Judgment tympanum  Last Judgment by Gislebertus in the west tympanum The Last Judgment is believed to have been created around 1130. The tympanum was saved from potential ruin as the canons who were managing the cathedral in the eighteenth century believed that Gislebertus' work was ugly, they covered it with plaster. The tympanum was rediscovered and released from the plaster in 1837. In 1766, the canons decided that the sculpture was not worth keeping because it was mediocre. They then covered everything in a layer of plaster in order to affix other art work on top of the tympanum. Not until 1837 when another canon curiously began to chip away at the plaster was the tympanum discovered. Luckily, it was preserved underneath the plaster with the exception of the head of Christ which was documented to have been removed so that the plaster could fill the tympanum completely. The West fa√ßade of St. Lazare contains the tympanum (1130‚Äì1135), signed Gislebertus hoc fecit (\\"Gislebertus made this\\") within the portico which is ranked amongst the masterpieces of Romanesque sculpture in France. However, art historian Linda Seidel challenged this reading, arguing that instead Gislebertus was a patron.Art History, 4th Edition, Stokstad The sheer size of the tympanum required that double lintels support it with a middle column to further support the sculpture. The left side of the tympanum displays the rise to the heavenly kingdom, and on the right is a portrayal of the demons in hell with an angel and a devil weighing the souls on a balance. Zodiac signs surround the arch vault with Christ in the center portrayed as a serene figure. Christ is placed in perfect symmetrical position with a balanced composition of elongated figures. Jesus is flanked by his mother, the Virgin Mary and his apostles cast as penitents and observers of the last judgment. St. Peter guards the gate to heaven and looks on as resurrected individuals attempt to squeeze in with the assistance of the angels. Gislebertus successfully integrated the modern view of heaven and hell and created a sculpture that would act as a visual educational device for individuals that were illiterate. Viewing the tympanum would allow pilgrim's to know what would happen to them if they were to end up in hell. Two men near the centre of the lintel carry bags bearing a cross and a seashell. These are the symbols of pilgrims that travelled from Jerusalem to Santiago de Compostela. The tympanum would have inspired terror in believers that passed beneath it and viewed the detailed high relief sculpture. The bottom of the tympanum underneath the weighing of the souls has an inscription that states, \\"May this terror terrify those whom earthly error binds for the horror of the images here in this manner truly depicts what will be\\". The tympanum is framed by two archivolts. The inner one has carved foliage while the outer archivolt consists of magnificently detailed medallions representing the four seasons, zodiacs, and labors of the months. There have been various attempts to explain the fact that the figures and scenes on the lintel seem to be an unnecessary doubling of some of the figures and scenes from the main relief. It was argued, for example, that the people represented on the lintel await judgement or that the scene represents the idea of \\"particular judgement\\" as opposed to \\"general judgement\\", which is represented on the main relief. Dƒôbicki rejects all these interpretations. According to him, the symbolism of the relief consistently reflects the theological views expressed by Honorius Augustodunensis in his Elucidarius. Specifically, the doubling is based on the idea that \\"on judgement day two classes [of people] will be divided into four\\" (in die judicii duo ordine in quattuor dividentur): the figures on the lintel represent the two general classes of people (the saved and the damned), while the figures on the tympanum represent the four particular classes.

A national monument, it is the seat of the Bishop of Bayeux and Lisieux and was the original home of the Bayeux Tapestry. The cathedral is in the Norman- Romanesque architectural tradition. The site is an ancient one and was once occupied by Roman sanctuaries. The present cathedral was consecrated on 14 July 1077 in the presence of William, Duke of Normandy and King of England. It was here that William may have forced Harold Godwinson to take the oath, the breaking of which led to the Norman conquest of England.

Notable smaller roles were played by Thikkurisi Sukumaran Nair, Adoor Bhavani, K. P. A. C. Lalitha, and Bharath Gopi. The film depicts the life of a couple‚ÄîVishwam (Madhu) and Sita (Sharada)‚Äîwho have married against their parents' wishes and want to start a new life at a new place. The title is an allusion to the ancient Indian practice of a girl of marriageable age choosing a husband from among a list of suitors. Swayamvaram marked several debuts‚Äîdirectorial of Gopalakrishnan, acting of the Malayalam star Bharath Gopi, and film producing of the Chitralekha Film Cooperative, an organisation cofounded by Gopalakrishnan himself. The film features an original score by M. B. Sreenivasan, camerawork by Mankada Ravi Varma, and film editing by Ramesan. Writer-director K. P. Kumaran co-scripted the film with Gopalakrishnan. It took seven years for Gopalakrishnan to get the project rolling when his initial proposal for a loan to make a film was turned down by the Film Finance Corporation (FFC). The FFC later partially financed the film when Chitralekha provided the rest. The film received widespread critical acclaim. It pioneered the new wave cinema movement in Malayalam cinema and became one of the first Malayalam films to use synchronised sound and outdoor locales. The film also became the first Indian film to use sound as a leitmotif. It was shown at various film festivals around the world like Moscow International Film Festival, and won four National Film Awards at the 20th National Film Awards in 1973, including Best Feature Film, Best Director for Gopalakrishnan, and Best Actress for Sharada. Plot A newly wed couple, Vishwam (Madhu) and Sita (Sharada), have married against the preference of their families, and left their hometown. Both want to start a new life at a new place. Initially, they stay in a decent hotel but soon due to financial reasons they move to another, ordinary hotel. Vishwam, an educated, unemployed youth, is an aspiring writer and had some of his short stories published in the newspapers earlier. He dreams of having his novel, titled Nirvriti (Ecstasy), published in the newspaper. He meets one of the newspaper editors (Vaikom Chandrasekharan Nair), who agrees to read his novel but declines to publish it as Vishwam does not have many writings to his credit. Sita is offered a job as a sales girl but cannot accept it because she is unable to pay the required security deposit of 1,000. With several unsuccessful attempts to get a job, the increasing financial pressure forces them to shift to a slum. With an old lady named Janaki (Adoor Bhavani) and a prostitute named Kalyani (K. P. A. C. Lalitha) as their neighbours, things do not work as desired for the couple and they end up selling Sita's jewellery. Vishwam takes a job as a zoology teacher in college but soon loses it. He then accepts a job as a clerk in a timber shop with a meager salary, replacing one of the dismissed employees (Bharath Gopi). Vishwam and Sita try to set up a happy home with their newborn baby, but soon their dreams fade as they struggle on precariously. When Vishwam falls ill, Sita tries for his betterment with all her capabilities but is unable to afford the medicines. She finally decides to call a doctor. However, Vishwam dies, leaving her alone with their infant baby. When Sita is advised to return to her parents after Vishwam's death, she declines. The film ends with Sita feeding her baby and gazing at a painting on the from an Indian Hindu epic, Ramayana, depicting Sita Swayamvara and determinedly at the closed door of their house.

It was also an affirmation to one of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's beliefs about an individual's right to make own choices. The film's English title for international release was mainly One's Own Choice, however it was shown at the Moscow International Film Festival under the title, On Own Will. Other translations of the Malayalam title have also been used, such as By Choice, Her Own Choice, Marriage by Choice, Betrothal by Choice, The Betrothal, and The Selection. =Development= While studying in the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune, Gopalakrishnan was influenced by the New Wave movement of global cinema and formed a film society in Kerala, named \\"Chitralekha Film Cooperative\\", with his classmates in 1965. Gopalakrishnan had initially submitted a romantic script Kamuki to the Film Finance Corporation (now National Film Development Corporation of India or NFDC) which they declined to finance. Later, he submitted the script for Swayamvaram, which Film Finance Corporation accepted and approved the loan of a . However, it took seven years for him to get the film rolling, after he passed out of the Film and Television Institute of India. Gopalakrishnan co-scripted the film with writer-director K. P. Kumaran. The film was produced by Chitralekha Film Co-operative, Kerala's first film co-operative society for film production, with Swayamvaram being their first feature film production. The film's total budget was and Gopalakrishnan used the money he had collected from his documentary productions. Initially, Chitralekha Film Co-operative, the producer of the film had trouble distributing the film, so they decided to do it by themselves. Ritwik Ghatak's 1965 film Subarnarekha was an influence to Gopalakrishnan. The Bengali film dealt with post Partition and tells the story of a Hindu Brahmin refugee Ishwar who raises his sister Sita and Abhiram, the son of a low-caste woman from a refugee camp. When the two fall in love, he rejects the relation. Abhiram and Sita elope to Calcutta. Years later. Ishwar on a binge drinking spree in Calcutta, visits a brothel; where Sita recognizes him and kills herself. Gopalakrishnan wondered what would have happened to the couple that eloped to the city and developed his story. =Casting= Gopalakrishan wanted fresh faces for both the lead roles and he had written letters to various heads of colleges and universities for the auditions. However, he did not receive any response from anywhere. For the female lead, Gopalakrishnan approached Sharada, one of the most successful actresses of her time. She was acting in commercial films when Gopalakrishnan asked her to star in Swayamvaram. Sharada was initially reluctant to commit herself to an art film, but agreed when Gopalakrishnan narrated the complete story to her at Prasad Studios, in Chennai. The male lead for the film, Madhu, was an old friend of Gopalakrishnan and had expressed a desire to act in one of his films. By the time Gopalakrishnan finished his studies and returned from FTII, Madhu was already a star in Malayalam cinema. Gopalakrishnan then decided to cast him opposite Sharada. Mentioning about his experience working with Gopalakrishnan and Swayamvaram, Madhu recollected in an interview that \\"[...] when Gopalakrishnan narrated the story of Swayamvaram, I knew it was going to be different.\\" Years later he also mentioned that he \\"sometimes wished Prem Nazir had acted in Adoor's Swayamvaram. He might have won a Bharath award. But he was very busy those days.\\" Malayalam actor-director Thikkurissy Sukumaran Nair was cast as a college principal. Bharath Gopi, who later became a major actor in the Malayalam film industry, made his film debut in Swayamvaram, doing a minor role as the dismissed factory employee who gets replaced by Madhu. Gopi was a noted stage actor before Swayamvaram and would later play the lead role in Gopalakrishnan's second feature film, Kodiyettam, which earned him a reputation as one of the finest actors in Indian cinema and also inspired his screen name as \\"Bharath Gopi\\" or \\"Kodiyettam Gopi\\". He won a Best Actor award, then known as \\"Bharat Award\\", for the role at the 25th National Film Awards in 1977. K. P. A. C. Lalitha, who would later play notable characters in many of Gopalakrishnan's films, played a small role as a prostitute in Swayamvaram. Noted Malayalam writer and journalist Vaikom Chandrasekharan Nair played a newspaper editor in the film. Gopalakrishnan praised him for his performance, expressing the difficulties of performing as oneself onscreen. =Filming= Due to financial crises, it took more than one and a half years for Gopalakrishnan to finish the film. Swayamvaram was one of the first Malayalam films to use synchronised sound and to be filmed in outdoor locales, for which Gopalakrishnan used his Nagra audio recorder. The film was shot in two schedules. It was delayed due to scheduling conflicts of the lead actress, Sharada. She was working in several films at that time, so Gopalakrishnan had to arrange the schedule to suit her convenience. The lead actor, Madhu, mentioned in an interview that Gopalakrishnan was clear about his characters and their behaviour. Gopalakrishnan also used to discuss the shoot with his crew before the shooting. The film marked the beginning of a collaboration between Gopalakrishnan and cinematographer Mankada Ravi Varma. Gopalakrishnan had seen Varma's work in his second film as a cinematographer, Olavum Theeravum (1970), and when he decided to work on Swayamvaram, Gopalakrishnan approached Varma with the script. Initially reluctant, Varma agreed to do the film due to its \\"extensive\\" and \\"very well written\\" script. Incidentally, Varma won his only National Film Award for Best Cinematography, with a career spanned over thirty years, for Swayamvaram. The film featured no songs and has only an original score by M. B. Sreenivasan. The editing of the film was done by Ramesan, whereas S. S. Nair and Devadathan worked together on the production design. Sound mixing was done by P. Devadas. The total budget of the film was , where the Film Finance Corporation provided 150,000 as a loan. Reception =Theatrical= The film had a lukewarm initial theatrical response. Gopalakrishnan was told that \\"If only he had some songs in it, it would have done well\\". After the announcement of the National Film Awards, the film was re-released in theatres and gathered better response this time, which also helped Gopalakrishnan repay the loan to FFC, the main producer of the film. The film participated in the competition section of the 8th Moscow International Film Festival in 1973. =Critical= The previews of the film were held at various places, where it was well received by critics and audiences. Noted writer M. Govindan wrote a cover story in his magazine Sameeksha, and organised a seminar on the film in Chennai, then known as Madras. Various intellectuals and writers took part in it, including noted film experts like P. Bhaskaran and director Balu Mahendra. Noted critic and film director Vijayakrishnan mentioned that Devadas's sound mixing work was one of the major attractions of the film. Considerable use of natural sound, apart from background music, was new for Malayalam cinema. Cast performances were also praised by critics. Bharath Gopi received considerable attention even for his minimal screen appearance. Though Madhu had acted previously in several films, including Ramu Kariat's National Award-winning film, Chemmeen (1965), Swayamvaram marked a turning point in his career. Although most of the reviews were positive, some film experts were critical about the film. Amaresh Datta, in his book The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature, criticised the film for \\"following the neo-realistic style\\" and showcasing \\"same old love story without any freshness added\\". Poet and journalist C. P. Surendran called the film \\"disturbing\\" in one of his articles, criticising Gopalakrishnan and his films. Shyam Benegal, a film director and a well-known admirer of Gopalakrishnan's films, also mentioned that he was not particularly pleased with Swayamvaram. Some critics have pointed out its resemblance to Ritwik Ghatak's Subarnarekha (1965). Gopalakrishnan agreed on influences of Ghatak and Satyajit Ray but pointed that Swayamvaram's treatment is different from Ghatak's Subarnarekha as Swayamvaram is more about the trip. The film received little critical response in Kerala, which Gopalakrishnan referred to as \\"more of a question of insensitivity rather than personal enmity.\\" However, some noted critics like Moorkoth Kunhappa and T. M. P. Nedungadi praised the movie, with Nedungadi writing a response titled \\"Swayamvaram over, what next in Malayalam cinema?\\" Legacy Swayamvaram pioneered the new wave cinema movement in Malayalam cinema. The film did not feature any dance numbers, comedy or melodramatic scenes, which were \\"usual ingredients\\" of films at that time, but it introduced viewers to then unknown techniques of film presentation, in which it was not merely used for \\"story-telling\\". It was an inevitable development for Malayalam cinema, as the film focused mainly on cinema rather than its story. The film also introduced film-goers to a new cinematic art through the impulses generated by the film, which in turn were more important than the film itself. The film is also said to have divided Malayalam films into three different categories, \\"uncompromising art films\\", \\"compromising films\\" which aimed at commercial success but tried maintaining a good deal of the artistic qualities, and the \\"commercial films\\" which purely aimed at box office success. Film critic Kozhikodan included Swayamvaram on his list of the 10 best Malayalam movies of all time. Through Swayamvaram, Gopalakrishnan became the first Indian director to use sound as a leitmotif (a recurring musical theme). The film provided a new experience to Indian cinema- goers, as it used ample amounts of natural sounds with a minimalistic background score. Digital restoration The National Film Archive of India has digitally restored the film, and the restored version with improved subtitles in English was screened at the International Film Festival of India in November 2012. Also, the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee has acquired all of Gopalakrishnan's features, including Swayamvaram, to restore and preserve.

The original cathedral of Arras, constructed between 1030 and 1396, was one of the most beautiful Gothic structures in northern France, until it was destroyed in the French Revolution. The cathedral was the resting place of Louis de Bourbon, L√©gitim√© de France, a legitimated son of Louis XIV and Louise de La Valli√®re. The church of the former St. Vaast's Abbey was rebuilt in classical style as a replacement cathedral. The design was chosen by the former abbot of St. Vaast's, the Cardinal de Rohan, and is of remarkable simplicity. It is 'a very large building, the erection of which was begun in 1755 from plans by Pierre Contant d'Ivry, the architect who later created designs for the Church of La Madeleine in Paris. The work was interrupted during the Revolution, then resumed by virtue of a municipal decree dated ‚ÄúNiv√¥se 27, Year XII‚Äù, which ran: ‚Äú... to erect the edifice, abandoning everything in the original plans connected with decoration and architectural beauty, limiting the work to the requirements of solidity and decency.‚Äù The church was finished in accordance with these prescriptions, being completed in 1834. The interior was of plaster-coated brickwork, whilst the columns were of undressed stone, covered with stone-coloured mortar. The capitals were of stucco-work.'

It is given by slow intravenous infusion once per day to once per week or by mouth once per day. Side effects of fosfestrol include nausea and vomiting, cardiovascular complications, blood clots, edema, and genital skin reactions, among others. Fosfestrol is an estrogen, and hence is an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It acts as a prodrug of diethylstilbestrol. Fosfestrol was patented in 1941 and was introduced for medical use in 1955. It was previously marketed widely throughout the world, but now remains available in only a few countries. Medical uses Fosfestrol is used as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. It is added once progression of metastases has occurred following therapy with other interventions such orchiectomy, gonadotropin-releasing hormone modulators, and nonsteroidal antiandrogens. Fosfestrol has also been used to prevent the testosterone flare at the start of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy in men with prostate cancer. Fosfestrol sodium is given at a dosage of 600 to 1200 mg/day by slow intravenous infusion over a period of 1 hour for a treatment duration of 5 to 10 days in men with prostate cancer. Following this, it is given at a dose of 300 mg/day for 10 to 20 days. Maintenance doses of fosfestrol sodium of 300 to 600 mg may be given four times per week. This may be gradually reduced to one 300 to 600-mg dose per week over a period of several months. Fosfestrol sodium is also used to a lesser extent by oral administration initially at a dosage of 360 to 480 mg three times per day in the treatment of prostate cancer. Maintenance doses of 120 to 240 mg three times per day may be used and can be gradually reduced to 240 mg/day. =Available forms= Fosfestrol is available in the form of solutions for intravenous administration and tablets for oral administration. Side effects Side effects of fosfestrol include nausea and vomiting in 80% of patients (with 1 in 25 cases, or 4%, resulting in death), cardiovascular complications (18% with fosfestrol plus adriamycin relative to 2% with adriamycin alone) such as thrombosis (2 in 25 cases, or 8%), edema (44% requiring diuretic therapy), and skin reactions such as burning, itching, or pain in the genital area (40%). In addition, weight gain, feminization, and gynecomastia may occur. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Testosterone levels with no treatment and with various estrogens in men with prostate cancer. Determinations were made with an early radioimmunoassay (RIA). Source was Shearer et al. (1973). Fosfestrol is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors. It is inactive itself and acts as a prodrug of diethylstilbestrol. Similarly to diethylstilbestrol, fosfestrol has powerful antigonadotropic effects and strongly suppresses testosterone levels in men. It decreases testosterone levels into the castrate range within 12 hours of the initiation of therapy. Fosfestrol may also act by other mechanisms, such as via direct cytotoxic effects in the prostate gland. =Pharmacokinetics= The pharmacokinetics of fosfestrol have been studied. Chemistry Fosfestrol is a synthetic nonsteroidal estrogen of the stilbestrol group. It is an estrogen ester; specifically, it is the diphosphate ester of diethylstilbestrol. Fosfestrol is provided both as the free base and as a tetrasodium salt. In terms of dose equivalence, 300 mg anhydrous fosfestrol sodium is equal to about 250 mg fosfestrol. A polymer of fosfestrol, polydiethylstilbestrol phosphate, was developed as a long-acting estrogen for potential use in veterinary medicine, but was never marketed. History Fosfestrol was first patented in 1941 and was mentioned in the literature by Huggins. Conjugated estrogens and diethylstilbestrol sulfate, which are water-soluble estrogens, were first reported to be effective in the treatment of prostate cancer via intravenous administration in 1952. Starting in October 1952, Flocks and colleagues studied intravenous fosfestrol in the treatment of prostate cancer, publishing their findings in 1955. Fosfestrol was first introduced for medical use in 1955 under the brand names Stilphostrol and ST 52 in the United States and France, respectively. Society and culture =Generic names= Fosfestrol is the generic name of the drug and its , , and , while diethylstilbestrol diphosphate is its and fosfestrolo is its .https://www.drugs.com/international/fosfestrol.html It is also known as stilbestrol diphosphate. Fosfestrol sodium is its and . =Brand names= Brand names of fosfestrol include Cytonal, Difostilben, Honovan, Honvan, Honvol, Honvon, Fosfostilben, Fostrolin, ST 52, Stilbetin, Stilbol, Stilbostatin, Stilphostrol, and Vagestrol, among others. =Availability= Fosfestrol has been marketed widely throughout the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, Latin America, and South Africa, among other areas of the world.

It was erected in the twelfth century, and is dedicated to the 3rd-century martyr Mammes of Caesarea. The cathedral is the seat of the Bishop of Langres, and is a national monument. History Around 1140, bishop Geoffroy de La Roche- Vanneau (1091‚Äì1162), a close friend of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, took the decision to rebuild the cathedral. At that time the cathedral of Saint-√âtienne in Sens was already under construction. Building began with the choir. The three-level frontage was taken from the third church at Cluny. The choir's flying buttresses were hidden, but those of the nave can be seen from the outside. We know from a bull of Pope Alexander III, who had taken refuge at Sens from 1163 to 1165, that in 1170 building was well underway. It only lacked the first span of the nave and the great west front. In 1190, following the sale of lands to the west, a last campaign was undertaken with a view to finishing the building work, and the cathedral was dedicated in 1196. It seems that at that date only the vaults of the nave were still to be built. In 1209, the holy relic of the head of Saint Mammes was brought to the cathedral. In the thirteenth century the cloister was built (of which two arcades remain today) as well as the chapel of the Virgin in the apse (promoted by the canon of Vergy). In 1314, a fire destroyed the nave's roof. In the sixteenth century, from 1547 to 1551, the canon d'Amoncourt, vicar-general of Claude de Longwy who was then bishop of Langres, had the chapel of the Holy Cross built on the left-hand side of the nave. In 1562, lightning caused another fire. In 1746, the west side threatened to collapse, and the decision was taken to demolish it. It was rebuilt from 1761 to 1786 in the classical style, in accordance with the plans of Claude-Louis D'Aviler dating from 1758. The works were managed by the architect Jean-Antoine Caristie. On 12 December 1790, the cathedral was closed, but reopened in 1791. In the nineteenth century, from 1852, the highest parts of the cathedral were renovated by the architect Alphonse Durand, who also built the sacristy from 1857 to 1862.

The theory holds that the earliest roots of the ancient Egyptian dynastic civilisation were imported by invaders from Mesopotamia who then founded the First Dynasty and brought culture to the indigenous population. This theory had strong supporters in the Egyptological community in the first half of the 20th century, but has since lost mainstream support. Origins In the early 20th century, Egyptologist Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie deduced that skeletal remains found at pre-dynastic sites at Naqada (Upper Egypt) indicated the presence of two different races, with the Dynastic Race, also referred to as the \\"Followers of Horus\\",Emery, W.B. Archaic Egypt, Penguin Books, 1987 0-14-020462-8 differentiated physically by a noticeably larger skeletal structure and cranial capacity.Derry, D.E., The Dynastic Race in Egypt, Journal of Egyptian Archeology, vol 42, 1956 Petrie concluded that the physical differences of the remains in conjunction with the previously unknown burial styles, uncharacteristic tomb architecture, and abundance of foreign artifacts, implied this race must have been an invading ruling elite that was responsible for the seemingly sudden rise of Egyptian civilization. Based on plentiful cultural evidence, Petrie determined that the invader race had come from Mesopotamia, and imposed themselves on the native Badarian culture to become their rulers. Petrie adduced new architectural styles‚Äîthe distinctly Mesopotamian \\"niched-facade\\" architecture‚Äîpottery styles, cylinder seals and a few artworks, as well as numerous Predynastic rock and tomb paintings depicting Mesopotamian style boats, symbols, and figures. This came to be called the \\"dynastic race theory\\"Mary R. Lefkowitz, Guy MacLean Rogers, Black Athena Revisited, pg65Early dynastic Egypt, by Toby A. H. Wilkinson, pg 15 The theory further argued that the Mesopotamians then conquered both Upper and Lower Egypt and founded the First Dynasty. Predynastic and First Dynasty burial sites similar to Naqada were also found at Abydos, Sakkara, and Hieraconpolis. Versions of the Dynastic race model were adopted by scholars as L. A. Waddell,Egyptian Civilization Its Sumerian Origin and Real Chronology, by L. A. Waddell and Walter Bryan Emery, a former Chair of Egyptology at University College London. Decline The dynastic race theory is no longer an accepted thesis in the field of predynastic archaeology. While there is clear evidence the Naqada II culture borrowed abundantly from Mesopotamia, the most commonly held view today is that the achievements of the First Dynasty were the result of a long period of cultural and political development.Early Dynastic Egypt (Routledge, 1999), p.15 Such borrowings are much older than the Naqada II period,Redford, Donald B., Egypt, Israel, and Canaan in Ancient Times (Princeton: University Press, 1992), p. 13. the Naqada II period had a large degree of continuity with the Naqada I period,Gardiner, Alan. Egypt of the Pharaohs (Oxford: University Press, 1961), p. 392. and the changes which did happen during the Naqada periods happened over significant amounts of time.Shaw, Ian. and Nicholson, Paul, The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt (London: British Museum Press, 1995), p. 228. Modern Egyptology largely maintains the view that \\"state formation occurred as a mainly indigenous process\\", although significant differences in morphology indicated migration along the Nile Valley also took place.Sonia R. Zakrzewski: Population continuity or population change: Formation of the ancient Egyptian state - Department of Archaeology, University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton (2003) The Dynastic Race theory has been largely replaced by the theory Egypt was a hydraulic empire. In Afrocentrism In the 1950s, when the Dynastic Race Theory was widely accepted by mainstream scholarship, the Senegalese scholar Cheikh Anta Diop was publicising his theory that the Ancient Egyptians were \\"Black Africans.\\" Diop \\"paid special attention to the emergence of the Dynastic Race Theory\\", and claimed that European scholars supported this theory to avoid having to admit that the Ancient Egyptians were black and to charactise them as \\"Semitic\\" or \\"Caucasian\\".Epic encounters: culture, media, and U.S. interests in the Middle East ‚Äì 1945-2000 by Melani McAlister Other prominent Afrocentrists, including Martin Bernal, later also argued against the dynastic race theory in favour of a \\"Black Egyptian\\" model.Heresy in the University: the Black Athena controversy and the Responsibilities of American Intellectuals. By Jacques Berlinerblau, pg 158 The most recent contributor to an Afrocentric model of the Ancient Egyptians is by Segun Magbagbeola, who included information from Nuwaupu in his book Black Egyptians. Afrocentrists particularly condemn the alleged dividing of African peoples into racial clusters as being new versions of the Dynastic Race Theory and the Hamitic hypothesis.History of Philosophy (3 Vols. Set), by William Turner , pg 8 Revival A version of the theory has been revived by some modern scholars, most notably David Rohl,Legend ‚Äì The Genesis of Civilisation, by David Rohl ::: http://www.davidrohl.com/dynastic_race_11.html and Michael Rice,Egypt's making: the origins of ancient Egypt, 5000-2000 BC, by Michael Rice who have advanced reasons in support of a Mesopotamian origin of Dynastic Egypt in books such as Rohl's Legend-The Genesis of Civilisation and Rice's Egypt's Making. According to Rohl, \\"There is little evidence of kingship and its rituals very much before the beginning of the 1st Dynasty; no signs of the gradual development of metal working, art, monumental architecture and writing‚Äîthe defining criteria of early civilisation. Much of what we know about the pharaohs and their complex culture seems to come into existence in a flash of inspiration.\\"Rohl, David M., Legend the Genesis of Civilisation (Arrow Books Limited, 1998), p. 253 Rohl believes the catalyst for this sudden development was the influx of a Mesopotamian \\"foreign elite\\" who made their way to Egypt by sailing around the coastline of the Arabian Peninsula into the Red Sea ultimately dragging their boats across the desert to the Nile. Rohl notes numerous pre-dynastic rock carvings found in several locations from Wadi Abbad to Abydos which is suggested depict large Mesopotamian style boats with crews of up to 75, some of which appear being pulled across land.Rohl, David M., Legend the Genesis of Civilisation (Arrow Books Limited, 1998), p. 253-302 Rohl believes the most dramatic evidence to support this theory is the sudden introduction of distinctly Mesopotamian \\"niched-facade\\", also known as \\"palace facade\\", architecture found in several early Dynastic sites, most notably the large 1st Dynasty mastabas at Saqqara. A depiction of a building using this kind of architecture is also an integral part of the serekh, the early Egyptian seal of kingship, and is found before the 1st Dynasty as well in the Naqada III, or \\"Dynasty 0\\" period. He says, \\"It is highly improbable that such specialized building techniques were independently invented in two widely separated regions at the same historical period without cultural transmission.Rohl, David M., Legend the Genesis of Civilisation (Arrow Books Limited, 1998), p. 332 In addition to the evidence available to Petrie et al., proponents also point out similarities in the names of divinities and places in the religious beliefs of the two cultures, and in depictions of regalia. For example the primeval mound of the Egyptian first creation was called the Island of Nun, and was surrounded by the Waters of Nun, while the Sumerian name for the great temple in their original city of Eridu was Nun.ki‚Äîthe 'Mighty Place'‚Äîand it was built on an island in the reed swamps. Several scholars have also noted that the name Osiris is a Greek pronunciation, and that the god would have been called Asar in Egyptian, while the Sumerian god of the Eridu area was also called Asar (the Babylonian Marduk.).Dictionary of Ancient Deities, by Patricia Turner, Charles Russell Coulter The Uruk period of Ancient Mesopotamia (4100‚Äì2900 BC calibrated) predates the Naqada II period of Ancient Egypt (3500-3200 BC) and indeed there is evidence of colonies of this Uruk civilization over a wide area‚Äîfrom the Taurus Mountains in Turkey, to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, and as far east as Central Iran.Algaze, Guillermo (2005) \\"The Uruk World System: The Dynamics of Expansion of Early Mesopotamian Civilization\\", (Second Edition, University of Chicago Press) See also *Ancient Egyptian race controversy References Category:Egyptology Category:Historical definitions of race Category:Origin hypotheses of ethnic groups Category:Prehistoric Egypt ","title":"Dynastic race theory"},{"id":"6661922","text":"Colerain High School is a public high school located near Cincinnati, Ohio.

It was built in the late 19th-century in the Romanesque Revival style and serves as the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Fort-de-France. The church is situated in the downtown area of the capital Fort-de-France, at the intersection of rue Victor Schoelcher and rue Bl√©nac. The construction of the cathedral began in the mid-17th century and it opened in 1657. Due to the natural disasters that have plagued Fort-de- France over the years, the current structure dates back to 1895 and was built with an iron frame in order to withstand these calamities. It is the seventh church to be erected on the site; it was built by Pierre-Henri Picq. History Before the present cathedral was completed in 1895, a total of six churches had previously been constructed on the site, the first of which was built in 1657. These were all destroyed by either fire, earthquakes or hurricanes. The loss of significant buildings was not uncommon in Fort-de- France, as devastating natural disasters frequently plagued the region. The cathedral that immediately preceded the present one was destroyed by fire in July 1890, a disaster that also obliterated three-quarters of the town. ' Pierre-Henri Picq was hired to be the architect. In the mid-1970s, the cathedral underwent an extensive program of restoration and refurbishment. Part of this entailed repainting the exterior to a tan and brown colour. ' The renovation was completed in 1978.

The building is located directly across the square from the consulate of the United States and is one block northwest from the park La Savane. The entire structure has a frame of iron beams which support the walls, ceiling and steeple making the church a fine example of architecture from the time of the Industrial Revolution. As a result, the cathedral is referred to in the Caribbean as the \\"Iron Cathedral\\" and has been compared to a \\"Catholic railway station\\". =Interior= The interior of the church is noted for its \\"grand organ\\", ornate walls, beautiful stained glass windows and balustrade made of iron.

Carnal Comics' flagship title is Carnal Comics: True Stories Of Adult Film Stars, which features autobiographies co-created with porn stars. Since the line‚Äôs inception, over 100 Carnal Comics have been published, including several crossovers with other adult comic publishers (Rip Off Press, Mu Press, Eros Comics and others). Carnal claims to have sold over a million comic books, and their late-90s series Triple-X Cinema: A Cartoon History was reported to be the best-selling adult comic ever carried by Diamond Comic Distributors, the leading (and essentially only) full-service United States comic book distributor. Carnal‚Äôs comics were the first monthly comics widely carried in adult novelty boutiques and their inclusion in large- scale mail order catalogs like Adam & Eve‚Äôs enabled the line to sell in numbers previously unheard of for standard 32-page adult comics. At its peak, Carnal also had a color section in each issue of Oui on newsstands, and its stars were doing regular TV and radio promotions on shows with Howard Stern, Jenny Jones, and others. Ads for the comics even infiltrated mainstream magazines, earning the company some notoriety and, in at least one case, inclusion in a stack of comic contraband taken during a police raid of a retail comic shop. History =Revolutionary Comics= Carnal Comics was initially created to be an adult comic imprint for San Diego-based Revolutionary Comics, which in 1991 was riding high on the popularity of their flagship title Rock 'N' Roll Comics. Publisher Todd Loren received a comic submission from Rock ‚ÄòN‚Äô Roll Comics creator Lyndal Ferguson for an erotic anthology series called Sexpot featuring short, expressionistic (and X-rated) stories. Around the same time, an illustrator named SS Crompton submitted some sketches in hope of landing assignments with Revolutionary Comics, including a drawing of a sexy character dubbed Demi the Demoness. Loren, who had recently expanded his comic line to include non-biographical titles, decided to launch an adults-only imprint to publish Ferguson‚Äôs comic and one featuring full- length adventures of Crompton‚Äôs Demi character. Revolutionary contributor Allen Salyer created a third adult title, Pineapple Perfume, and Loren announced the three comics‚Äô impending publication in other Revolutionary titles. The first three Carnal Comics were to be printed and released all at once, but Revolutionary‚Äôs printer objected to what it perceived as ‚Äúdemonic‚Äù content in Demi The Demoness and refused to work on it. That job was moved to a Canadian printer (who later earned all of Revolutionary‚Äôs substantial business) and the three inaugural Carnal Comics were finally released in 1992. In 1994, Revolutionary was being run by Loren‚Äôs father Herb Shapiro and the company‚Äôs managing editor Jay Allen Sanford. The band Kiss was working with the company on a three-issue comic series, and around this time Kiss bassist Gene Simmons invited several staffers to his birthday party in Los Angeles. Sanford has reported that Simmons had once, previously, suggested that the company do ‚ÄúJesus or porn star comics‚Äù, and in fact the notion of porn star bios had come up shortly after Todd Loren‚Äôs death. Sanford and editor Patrick McCray discussed reviving the Carnal Comics name to do porn star bios, but the idea was abandoned when it became clear that making deals with the stars themselves would be too great a challenge and Revolutionary Comics was already putting out upwards of a half dozen comics per month. At Simmons‚Äô party, numerous porn stars were present and apparently the notion of Carnal Comics: True Stories Of Adult Film Stars took off there. Sanford soon announced that Revolutionary had signed porn star Sarah Jane Hamilton to co-script a three- issue series, telling her life story. Each issue would also have a second fictional story scripted by Sarah-Jane herself, taking place in different time periods and featuring the popular British redhead meeting up (and getting intimate) with various historical figures. Sarah Jane herself participated with in-person promotions like a hugely attended press party in April 1994 at Golden Apple Comics, L.A.‚Äôs biggest comic shop, as well as appearing at events like GlamourCon, Erotica L.A. and the famed San Diego Comic Convention. By its second issue, \\"Carnal Comics: True Stories Of Adult Film Stars\\" was selling in numbers almost as high as Rock ‚ÄòN‚Äô Roll Comics (which, while in decline along with all U.S. publishers at the time, were still selling around 15,000 to 20,000 copies per issue). =Re-Visionary Press= In summer 1994, Revolutionary Comics‚Äô publisher Herb Shapiro decided to close the company, in part because of debt accrued by a failed color sports comic line. Managing Editor Jay Allen Sanford made a deal to acquire rights to the Carnal title and formed a company called Re-Visionary Press to publish the series. His common- law wife Heather Dawn designed the company logo and the third porn star Carnal Comic, Sarah-Jane Hamilton #3, was published from the couple‚Äôs home in La Mesa, California, before they‚Äôd even been able to set up a computer or company phone line (the editorial column was typeset on a typewriter). From that point forward, each month saw the release of a new Carnal Comic, each one featuring a different star (no more multiple parts for a single woman), and before long the company expanded to doing several titles per month. Company principals Sanford and Dawn were the main creators, working with a wide spectrum of contributors from the now-defunct Revolutionary Comics, newcomers, and even some well-known mainstream creators like Pat Broderick (X-Men), Kevin Breyfogle (Batman) and Grateful Dead album cover painter Phil Garris. Re- Visionary‚Äôs flagship title was formally christened Carnal Comics: True Stories Of Adult Film Stars, Told By The Stars Themselves. The first Carnal Comic to carry only the Re-Visionary logo was Tyffany Million #1. Million had been popular as a former pro wrestler for G.L.O.W. (Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling) and the issue sold very well, as did subsequent issues which were released every 30 days. The Million issue, and many early Carnal Comics, were drawn by a female artist calling herself Fauve (she was later known by her real name, Holly Golightly). Sanford met Fauve at a Pittsburgh comic convention and decided her sensual artwork was perfect for the comic. Her first published work would be for Carnal. She drew for all three Sarah-Jane issues and she went on to become a well-known and popular illustrator and writer, even contributing eventually to Archie Comics. She currently publishes her own comic book titles under the Broadsword Comics banner, assisted by Catwoman artist Jim Balent. In the late nineties, Carnal expanded and began launching additional titles, sometimes several per month, such as Porn Star Fantasies, Superstars Of Erotica, The Golden Age Of Triple-X (adaptation of vintage adult films), the psychosexual horror series Nightingale: Mistress Of Dreams and many others. Many stores and municipalities still considered Carnal‚Äôs publications obscenity and sometimes issues were seized by police and border officials as such. Advertising outside the adult magazine market was a challenge, as newspapers and magazines often rejected Carnal ads because of the sexual nature of the comics, without ever inspecting copies of the comics themselves. One comic book store, Planet Comics and Science Fiction Store, in Oklahoma City, was raided by police in September 1995,Raphael, Jordan and Ronan, John F. \\"Newswatch: Business News: Planet Comics Seizes Industry Attention: Hearing Date Set; Co-Owners each Face Maximum Sentence of 86 Years; Publisher Response Varied; Christian Right Organizations Claim Involvement,\\" The Comics Journal #182 (Nov. 1995), pp. 7-12. and copies of Carnal Comics, Verotika, Eros Comics, and others were used in a court case\\"Newswatch: Planet Comics Prepares for Hearing, Police Raid Retailer's Home,\\" The Comics Journal #183 (Jan. 1996), p. 15-16 that eventually caused the shop to be shut down.Ronan, John F. \\"Newswatch: Planet Comics Closes, Case Continues,\\" The Comics Journal #184 (Feb. 1996), pp. 7-10. Re-Visionary‚Äôs major 1997 project was a three-issue series called Triple-X Cinema: A Cartoon History. Scripted by Jay Allen Sanford, participating in its creation were dozens of the major figures of the erotic film industry including Marilyn Chambers, Bill Margold, Hyapatia Lee, Porsche Lynn, Nina Hartley, Seka, Kay Parker and dozens more producers and performers, including the elusive Gerard Damiano, who directed the original Deep Throat film. Re-Visionary was placing its adults-only line in places that had never been exposed to comics before. A big boost came from joining forces with Adam & Eve, at that time the largest mail order catalog of adult merchandise in the world. Adam & Eve even had their own cable network, so this provided the line with real growth. The women who starred in Carnal Comics were promoting the line on Spice (the channel owned by Adam and Eve), the Playboy Channel, and TV shows like The Jerry Springer Show and Geraldo, and the comics generated positive press in Hustler, Chic, High Society, Screw, Adult Video News, and dozens of other major magazines. Carnal Comics was spun off into a comic strip version as well. Sanford began producing a multi-page, full-color version of \\"Porn Star Fantasies\\" for various adult magazines, most notably Oui Magazine,\\"Newswatch: Carnal Comics Joins Forces with Oui,\\" The Comics Journal #184 (Feb. 1996), p. 48. one of the four top-selling men's periodicals at the time. Heather Dawn provided hand-painted colors for R-rated versions of Carnal‚Äôs best X-rated stories. Oui's Carnal Comics ran for almost two years and Carnal produced similar color strips for Hustler Humor, Adult Cinema Review, New Rave, Dirty, and others. Publishers in several countries bought exclusive licenses to reprint Carnal Comics, such as Christos Koudakis & Associates, which has the exclusive rights to publish 48-page magazine versions of Re-Visionary‚Äôs adults-only line in Greece. The Greek version of Carnal Comics has its covers feature paintings by famed movie poster and book cover artist Boris Vallejo. Around early 1999, the Carnal line was gradually shutting down. In the 2004 book Carnal Comics: The Inside Story, publisher Sanford said: =Opus Graphics= In 2001, Re-Visionary Press handed over the Carnal Comics imprint to Opus Graphics, the firm set up by Crompton to publish its titles. Though no longer on a monthly schedule, Carnal Comics still produces several titles per year, including fantasy-based comics like Demi the Demoness, Djustine, Calavera, Strange Bedfellows and occasional biographical comics on stars such as Jenna Jameson, Felecia, Aurora Snow, and Tricia Devereaux. Contributing creators A number of well-known artists have contributed to the Carnal line. Album cover painter Phil Garris painted one of the most iconic images of all time ‚Äì the fiddle-playing skeleton on the cover of the Grateful Dead‚Äôs Blues for Allah album. Garris (also known for famed covers for Toto, Steve Miller and others) painted two Carnal covers, one for Aja #1 and another for a comic on porn star Savannah. X-Men and Micronauts artist Pat Broderick drew stories on Brittany Andrews and duo Summer Cummings & Skye Blue, while Batman artist Kevin Breyfogle drew a number of Carnal issues. Creator-owned Carnal editions have been launched by one-time Howard the Duck and Doctor Strange artist Frank Brunner and Stickboy creator Dennis Worden. Painter Jeff Pittarelli ‚Äì who went on to work with Traci Lords ‚Äì did many Carnal covers, as did Jamie Murray (best known for book covers for series featuring Star Wars and TV‚Äôs Beauty & The Beast). Popular pinup painter Todd Borenstein also contributed several Carnal cover portraits (Letha Weapons, Christi Lake, Roxy Rider, etc.). The very first Carnal comic to feature a porn star ‚Äì Sarah-Jane Hamilton #1 ‚Äì sported a cover by Ken Meyer, Jr. (Ghost Rider, Magic: The Gathering, etc). Author and cartoonist Jay Allen Sanford is an American author and cartoonist best known for his work with Revolutionary Comics, the San Diego Reader, and Pacific Comics. He began writing the comic book Rock ‚ÄòN‚Äô Roll Comics (created by Todd Loren) in 1989 as of the title's second issue, and still oversees the rock comic reprints published by Bluewater Productions and others. Film crossovers Carnal also delved into actual filmmaking. The first was a combination comic book and film called Sordid Stories, starring Annabel Chong as superhero Pink Stiletto (Chong later gained fame doing the first World‚Äôs Biggest Gangbang). Sanford scripted the film and comic and the film was produced by Amazing Pictures and John Bowen, aka John T. Bone (known for his sexploitation/sci-fi film projects). Sordid Stories was nominated for two Adult Video News Awards (the adult industry‚Äôs Oscar equivalent), and more filmmakers began contacting Re-Visionary about storyboarding and other pre-production work. Before long, Carnal was doing full film treatments and shooting scripts, most all of them based around fantasy and science fiction storylines. Another comic/film project was a superhero thriller from Wicked Pictures, known for their high-gloss, big- budget adult features, starring Jenna Jameson, then the best-known and most- popular porn star in the world. The half-million dollar movie was shot on film (a rarity in adult movies). As with Sordid Stories, the Wicked Weapon comic book and video were released and cross promoted simultaneously in the comic and adult boutique markets. Carnal also produced a special 16-page mini-comic which was included with the entire initial video run of the big-budget adult film Wicked Weapon, packaged with the video itself, now one of the rarest of all Carnal publications. The Wicked Weapon video was nominated for five AVN awards, increasing Carnal‚Äôs credibility and reputation in the adult marketplace even more. By this point, Carnal was long past calling prospective subjects to work with - they had a year-long waiting list of girls clamoring to be in a Carnal comic book. For its next comic/films Carnal teamed up with former porn legend Veronica Hart, who was directing two movies featuring comeback appearances by women who'd long been out of the adult film business but whose names were still legendary - Ginger Lynn and Marilyn Chambers. Chambers' last X-rated film had been 1980's Insatiable. She remained in the public eye with R-rated TV series on HBO, Cinemax, The Playboy Channel and more. Lynn had retired from hardcore in 1986 and gone on to some success in films like the Vice Academy series and music videos. Chambers‚Äô new film was to be called Still Insatiable, while Lynn‚Äôs was called Torn. Both were filmed by VCA Pictures, known for lavish, groundbreaking and expensive feature films and an exclusive stable of the industry‚Äôs most-popular performers. Carnal‚Äôs official comic book souvenir magazines based on the two most-heavily promoted films in X-rated history were the company‚Äôs best sellers since Triple-X Cinema: A Cartoon History. In May 2008 Carnal's longest-running character Demi the Demoness was released on DVD as a live-action movie. The adults-only film, directed by Steve Steele and co-written by current Carnal publisher and Demi- creator SS Crompton, featured Demi and co-star Vampirooni fighting an evil but beautiful witch. The film starred Ellie Idol as Demi the Demoness, Sinn Sage as Vampirooni and Audrey Elson as Lyssa the Witch.Demi the Demoness official website.

Building history The former cathedral dominates the town and the belfry tower of 1488 can be seen at a distance as the town is approached. The repairs and modifications of the cathedral go back to the 12th century. The unadorned west front erected in the 15th century has been modified through the ages, and niches above the door have all but melted away due to the fragility of the limestone. The nave was vaulted at the end of the 12th century, then repaired in 1480. Vaulted chapels were added at the beginning of the 16th century and more alterations followed in the 17th and 18th centuries. The choir and apse were also reconstructed at the beginning of the 16th century, and the five square apsidal chapels were completed. The ambulatory was created in 1600 by introducing ten cylindrical piers, and the carved early 17th century choir stalls were placed here in the 19th century. The stained glass is typically 19th century with a Tree of Jesse in the Chapelle de la Sainte Famille.

It is the cathedral church of the Archdiocese of Lille. An example of Gothic Revival architecture, the cathedral is considered a national monument. The church was built in honor of the Virgin Mary and takes its name from a 12th-century statue of the saint that has miraculous properties ascribed to it. The project of its construction, which was carried out by a commission that brought together representatives of the clergy and lay members of the upper middle class such as :fr:Charles Kolb-Bernard, had a twofold objective. The first was to rebuild a large church in the heart of the city, after the destruction of the Collegiate Church of St. Peter during the French Revolution, which had housed the statue of Our Lady of the Treille for more than six hundred years. The second was to establish an episcopal see in Lille, which then belonged to the Archdiocese of Cambrai. This creation was considered essential to establish the city's status as a religious capital and to serve the growing population during the period of the Industrial Revolution. The building was therefore designated from the outset to be a future cathedral. Its construction, which spanned nearly a hundred and fifty years, began in 1854 with the laying of a foundation stone and the launch of an international competition for the design of a building inspired by the \\"Gothic style of the first half of the 13th century\\". Of the 41 submissions made, the first two prizes were awarded to English projects. However, the idea of entrusting the construction of a church in honor of the Virgin to foreign architects of an Anglican confession raised objections. Therefore, the realization of the project fell into the hands of Lille architect Charles Leroy. The construction of the church faced many difficulties, especially to raise the necessary funds for the continuation of the work. The cathedral was built in stages under the direction of several generations of architects from 1856 to 1975. It was completed in 1999 by the installation of a modern facade, with part of the initial program having been abandoned. Originally a simple church, it was given the title of minor basilica by Pope Pius X in 1904. In 1913, the Archdiocese of Cambrai was split to create the diocese of Lille, with the basilica serving as its new cathedral. In 2008, following the reorganization of the ecclesiastical provinces of France, the diocese of Lille was elevated to the status of metropolis and the cathedral became a metropolitan cathedral, seat of the Archbishop of Lille. History =Our Lady of the Treille= The cathedral owes its name to a statue of the Virgin Mary, known as Our Lady of the Treille, which was housed at the Collegiate Church of St. Peter from the beginning of the 13th century and has since been the object of devotion and veneration. The statue is described by Charles Bernard, parish priest of the Church of St. Catherine, as a statue of stone \\"a little more than two and a half feet high; she has a scepter in her right hand, and from her left she supports the baby Jesus on her knees.\\" He mentions a trellis of gilded wood surrounding the statue and its pedestal, and specifies that the old trellis made of gilded iron was lost in 1792 during the destruction of the Collegiate Church of St. Peter. He speculates that this trellis is what gave the statue its name, although it is more likely that the name came from Treola, a place existing in the 9th century in what is now Lille. Three series of miraculous events are associated with the statue, occurring in 1254, from 1519 to 1527, and from 1634 to 1638. The miracle of 1254 was the healing of the patients who resorted to her intercession. The miracles in the 16th century were varied and included deliverance from demonic possession, hernias, blindness, paralysis and plague. In 1254, a confraternity of Our Lady of the Treille was canonically established by Pope Alexander IV, and since 1259, an annual procession in honor of Our Lady of the Treille was held, a practice which continued until the French Revolution. In 1634, Jean Le Vasseur, mayor of Lille, consecrated the city to Our Lady of the Treille. In 1667, Louis XIV, who had just taken Flanders, took an oath to respect the freedoms of Lille before the statue. After the destruction of the Collegiate Church of St. Peter, which had been badly damaged during the Austrian siege of 1792 before being demolished in the French Revolution, the statue largely fell into oblivion. It was bought by a sexton, Alain Gambier, who placed it in the Church of St. Catherine, where it remained between 1797 and 1802. It was not until 1842 that Charles Bernard, parish priest of the Church of St. Catherine, restored the cult of Our Lady of the Treille and tried to strengthen it again: he instituted the month of Mary, patron saint of Lille, and had the statue placed in the Chapel of the Blessed Virgin of St. Catherine's Church. The celebration in great pomp of the secular jubilee of the first miracles of Our Lady of the Treille, in 1854 constituted a decisive step in this restoration work. The restoration project is also believed to have been marked by providence, due to the unexpected acquisition of the land on which the new church in honor of the Lady of the Treille would be built, making it possible to lay the church's foundation stone before the end of the jubilee celebration. = The Creation of the Diocese = In the middle of the 19th Century, in spite of the size of the town and the growing population of the surrounding region, Lille did not have its own bishop, but belonged to the Archdiocese of Cambrai. While proposals to create a new diocese for Lille and its surrounds had been made in the past, they had not been successful. In 1852, however, the Lille deputy Charles Kolb-Bernard recommended the creation of a new diocese, which would cover the districts of Lille, Dunkirk, and Hazebrouck, in a public report entitled Int√©r√™ts communaux de la ville de Lille.Fr√©d√©ric Vienne, \\"Les fondements de la cr√®ation de dioc√®se\\" An anti- Republican Legitimist and a spokeperson for the protectionist upper bourgeoisie, Kolb-Bernard was dedicated to the moralisation of the working class at a time when social tensions were exacerbated by mass immigration from Belgium and the impoverishment of large parts of the population due to industrialisation; he saw the creation of a new bishopric as a means to \\"re- Christianise\\" a population largely denied the spiritual relief of religion. The cause was likewise taken up by the lawyer Armand Prat in his 1856 memoir, Thoughts on the Creation of a Bishopric of Lille. The creation of the new bishopric also involved financial and linguistic considerations. The Diocese of Cambrai covered, in effect, two distinct linguistic areas, with Flemish the majority language in the north-west, due in part to the heavy immigration from nearby Belgium. Indeed, a few decades later in 1896, a report found that 25% of the residents of Lille did not hold French citizenship, and of these more than 98% were Belgium, mainly from Flemish-speaking Flanders. From the 1870s, the Flemish represented two fifths of the population of Wazemmes and half of the population of districts such as Moulins and Fives, and the town of Roubaix. From a financial perspective, the growing population was anticipated to provide a substantial income to a new diocese, while the expenses of the creation would fall primarily on the state. = The Construction of a Cathedral = In early 1853, Charles Kolb-Bernard and his cousin, Charles Bernard, vicar general at Cambrai, created a commission with the object of building a magnificent church in honour of Our Lady of the Treille. The commission brought together representatives of the clergy and the industrial bourgeoisie of Lille, who strongly supported the creation of a new Bishopric, and soon began to think of the planned church as a future cathedral. Land in the heart of Old Lille, the site of the ancient, recently-levelled castle mound, was purchased for a sum of 223,000 francs. An international competition was launched in 1854 for the design of the church, which was to be inspired by the Gothic style of the early 13th century, and the first stone was laid on the first of July 1854 by the Archbishop of Cambrai, in the course of the celebration of the feast of Our Lady of Treille, drawing large crowds including the mayor and ten bishops.

The former cathedral is a national monument. History During antiquity, Mariana was an important Roman military colony, founded in 93 BC by Gaius Marius. Christianity was implanted there early (proven by a Christian complex dating from the fourth century) and the diocese of Mariana was established in the fifth century, making it one of the first in Corsica's history. The diocese became the seat of the suffragan of the archdiocese of Pisa in 1092, like all bishoprics of Corsica. The Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta in Venice is based on the eleventh century site known as La Canonica and was dedicated in 1119 by the archbishop of Pisa. The diocese was connected with the archdiocese of Genoa and the bishoprics of Accia and Nebbio. It remained the seat of the bishop of Mariana from 1269 to 1440, when it was moved to Vescovato Cathedral. In 1563, Pope Pius IV merged the dioceses of Mariana and Accia, then removed them entirely in favor of the diocese of Bastia (Bastia Cathedral became the seat of the diocese in 1507). Bastia and all other Corsican bishoprics were suppressed in favor of the Bishop of Ajaccio in 1801. The church was listed by Prosper M√©rim√©e after returning from his trip to Corsica in 1886 and was made a monument historique (a national heritage site of France) on July 12 in the same year.

Jacob Joshua Falk () (also: Yaakov Yehoshua ben Tzvi Hirsch, or Yaakov Yehoshua Falk - see Note on the name \\"Joshua Falk\\") 1680 - January 16, 1756) was a Polish and German rabbi and Talmudist, known as the Pnei Yehoshua.sometimes spelled Pene YehoshuaPassing of Pnei Yehoshua (Event). 1755. Shevat 14 is the anniversary of the passing of Rabbi Yaakov Yehoshua Falk Katz (1680-1755), author of ... Biography Falk was born in Cracow in 1680 and died on the 14th of Shevat in Offenbach am Main in 1756. On his mother's side he was a grandson of Rabbi Yehoshua Heschel b. Yosef of Cracow, the author of Maginne Shelomoh. While a youth he became examiner of the Hebrew teachers of Lemberg. In 1702 his first wife, Leah Landau, his child, Guitel, and his mother were killed through an explosion of gunpowder that wrecked the house in which they lived. Falk himself narrowly escaped death, and was trapped in the debris of the explosion for hours. He vowed that if he got out alive, he would write a Sefer. He was miraculously saved, and thereafter wrote the Pnei Yehoshua. He married a second wife, Toba, who bore him four sons and at least two daughters. He was called to the rabbinate of Tarlow and Lisko, small Galician towns. In 1717 he replaced Rabbi Tzvi Ashkenazi in the chief rabbinate of Lemberg; and thence he was called to Berlin in 1731. Having displeased Veitel-Heine Ephraim, one of the most influential leaders of the community, by rendering a judgment against him, he was compelled at the expiration of his term of office (1734) to resign. After having been for seven years rabbi of Metz he became chief rabbi of Frankfort-on-the-Main; but the unfavorable attitude of the local authorities toward the Jews, and the fact that the community was divided by controversies, made his position there very precarious. Soon afterward, the quarrel between Rabbis Yaakov Emden and Yonatan Eybesch√ºtz broke out. Falk strongly opposed Eybesch√ºtz, and was ultimately compelled to leave Frankfurt in 1750, due to the strong support Eybesch√ºtz had there. He wandered from town to town until he came to Worms, where he remained for some years. He was recalled to Frankfurt; but his enemies prevented him from preaching in the synagogue, and he left the city a second time. Following his death his body was interred at , Frankfurt am Main. Author of Pene Yehoshua Rabbi Yaakov Yehoshua was one of the greatest Talmudists of his time and his book of commentary and novellae on the Talmud, Pene Yehoshua, is one of the classic works of the era of Acharonim. It remains an important book in the study of Talmud to this day. He wrote Pene Yehoshua in four parts. Two of them were published in Frankfurt am Main (1752); the third, with his Pesak bet-Din Chadash, at F√ºrth (1766); the fourth, which, in addition to Talmudic novellae, contains novellae on the Tur Choshen Mishpat and Likkutim, also in F√ºrth (1780). Falk mentions writing a commentary on the Pentateuch, but it was never published.

Early pioneers in the field include Aleksander Jablonski, Gregorio Weber,Weber, G., 1953. Rotational Brownian motion and polarization of the fluorescence of solutions. Adv. Protein Chem. 8:415-459 and Andreas Albrecht.Albrecht, A., 1961. Polarizations and assignments of transitions: the method of photoselection. J. Mol. Spectrosc. 6:84-108. The principles of fluorescence polarization and some applications of the method are presented in Lakowicz's book.Lakowicz, J.R., 2006. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy (3rd ed., Springer. Chapter 10-12 deal with fluorescence polarization spectroscopy.) Definition of fluorescence anisotropy thumbnail The anisotropy (r) of a light source is defined as the ratio of the polarized component to the total intensity (I_T): r=\\\\frac{I_z- I_y}{I_x+I_y+I_z} When the excitation is polarized along the z-axis, emission from the fluorophore is symmetric around the z-axis(Figure). Hence statistically we have I_x=I_y. As I_y=I_{\\\\perp}, and I_z=I_{\\\\parallel}, we have r=\\\\frac{I_{\\\\parallel}-I_{\\\\perp}}{I_{\\\\parallel}+2I_{\\\\perp}}=\\\\frac{I_{\\\\parallel}-I_{\\\\perp}}{I_{T}}. Principle ‚Äì Brownian motion and photoselection Brownian Motion of a Nanoparticle In fluorescence, a molecule absorbs a photon and gets excited to a higher energy state. After a short delay (the average represented as the fluorescence lifetime \\\\tau), it comes down to a lower state by losing some of the energy as heat and emitting the rest of the energy as another photon. The excitation and de-excitation involve the redistribution of electrons about the molecule. Hence, excitation by a photon can occur only if the electric field of the light is oriented in a particular axis about the molecule. Also, the emitted photon will have a specific polarization with respect to the molecule. The first concept to understand for anisotropy measurements is the concept of Brownian motion. Although water at room temperature contained in a glass to the eye may look very still, on the molecular level each water molecule has kinetic energy and thus there are a continuous number of collisions between water molecules. A nanoparticle (yellow dot in the figure) suspended in solution will undergo a random walk due to the summation of these underlying collisions. The rotational correlation time (Œ¶r), the time it takes for the molecule to rotate 1 radian, is dependent on the viscosity (Œ∑), temperature (T), Boltzmann constant (kB) and volume (V) of the nanoparticle: \\\\phi _r = {{\\\\eta V} \\\\over {k{_B}T}} The second concept is photoselection by use of a polarized light. When polarized light is applied to a group of randomly oriented fluorophores, most of the excited molecules will be those oriented within a particular range of angles to the applied polarization. If they do not move, the emitted light will also be polarized within a particular range of angles to the applied light. For single-photon excitation the intrinsic anisotropy r0 has a maximum theoretical value of 0.4 when the excitation and emission dipoles are parallel and a minimum value of -0.2 when the excitation and emission dipoles are perpendicular. {r_0} = {2 \\\\over 5}\\\\left( {{{3 \\\\right) where Œ≤ is the angle between the excitation and emission dipoles. For steady- state fluorescence measurements it is usually measured by embedding the fluorophore in a frozen polyol. Taking the idealistic simplest case a subset of dye molecules suspended in solution that have a mono-exponential fluorescence lifetime \\\\tau and r0=0.4 (rhodamine 6g in ethylene glycol made to have an absorbance of ~0.05 is a good test sample). If the excitation is unpolarized then the measured fluorescence emission should likewise be unpolarized. If however the excitation source is vertically polarized using an excitation polarizer then polarization effects will be picked up in the measured fluorescence. These polarization artifacts can be combated by placing an emission polarizer at the magic angle of 54.7¬∫. If the emission polarizer is vertically polarized there will be an additional loss of fluorescence as Brownian motion results in dye molecules moving from an initial vertical polarized configuration to an unpolarized configuration. On the other hand, if the emission polarizer is horizontally polarized there will be an additional introduction of excited molecules that were initially vertically polarized and became depolarized via Brownian motion. The fluorescence sum and difference can be constructed by addition of the intensities and subtraction of the fluorescence intensities respectively: S = {I_{VV}} + 2G{I_{VH}} D = {I_{VV}} - G{I_{VH}} Dividing the difference by the sum gives the anisotropy decay: r = {D \\\\over S} The grating factor G is an instrumental preference of the emission optics for the horizontal orientation to the vertical orientation. It can be measured by moving the excitation polarizer to the horizontal orientation and comparing the intensities when the emission polarizer is vertically and horizontally polarized respectively. G = \\\\over {{I_{HV}}}} G is emission wavelength dependent. Note G in literature is defined as the inverse shown. The degree of decorrelation in the polarization of the incident and emitted light depends on how quickly the fluorophore orientation gets scrambled ( the rotational lifetime \\\\phi ) compared to the fluorescence lifetime ( \\\\tau). The scrambling of orientations can occur by the whole molecule tumbling or by the rotation of only the fluorescent part. The rate of tumbling is related to the measured anisotropy by the Perrin equation: r(\\\\tau)=\\\\frac{r_0}{1+\\\\tau/\\\\tau_c} Where r is the observed anisotropy, r0 is the intrinsic anisotropy of the molecule, \\\\tau is the fluorescence lifetime and \\\\tau_c is the rotational correlation time.Valeur, Bernard. 2001. Molecular Fluorescence: Principles and Applications Wiley-VCH, p.29 This analysis is valid only if the fluorophores are relatively far apart. If they are very close to another, they can exchange energy by FRET and because the emission can occur from one of many independently moving (or oriented) molecules this results in a lower than expected anisotropy or a greater decorrelation. This type of homotransfer F√∂rster resonance energy transfer is called energy migration FRET or emFRET. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy only give an \\"average\\" anisotropy. Much more information can be obtained with time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy where the decay time, residual anisotropy and rotational correlation time can all be determined from fitting the anisotropy decay. Typically a vertically pulsed laser source is used for excitation and timing electronics are added between the start pulses of the laser (start) and the measurement of the fluorescence photons (stop). The technique Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) is typically employed. Again using the idealistic simplest case a subset of dye molecules suspended in solution that have a mono-exponential fluorescence lifetime \\\\tau and an initial anisotropy r0=0.4. If the sample is excited with a pulsed vertically orientated excitation source then a single decay time \\\\tau should be measured when the emission polarizer is at the magic angle. If the emission polarizer is vertically polarized instead two decay times will be measured both with positive pre-exponential factors, the first decay time should be equivalent to \\\\tau measured with the unpolarized emission set-up and the second decay time will be due to the loss of fluorescence as Brownian motion results in dye molecules moving from an initial vertical polarized configuration to an unpolarized configuration. On the other hand, if the emission polarizer is horizontally polarized, two decay times will again be recovered the first one with a positive pre-exponential factor and will be equivalent to \\\\tau but the second one will have a negative pre-exponential factor resulting from the introduction of excited molecules that were initially vertically polarized and became depolarized via Brownian motion. The fluorescence sum and difference can be constructed by addition of the decays and subtraction of the fluorescence decays respectively: S(t) = G{I_{VV}}(t) + 2{I_{VH}}(t) D(t) = G{I_{VV}}(t) - {I_{VH}}(t) Dividing the difference by the sum gives the anisotropy decay: r(t) = {D(t) \\\\over S(t)} In the simplest case for only one species of spherical dye: r(t) = {r_0}\\\\exp \\\\left( { - {t \\\\over }} \\\\right) Applications Fluorescence anisotropy can be used to measure the binding constants and kinetics of reactions that cause a change in the rotational time of the molecules. If the fluorophore is a small molecule, the rate at which it tumbles can decrease significantly when it is bound to a large protein. If the fluorophore is attached to the larger protein in a binding pair, the difference in polarization between bound and unbound states will be smaller (because the unbound protein will already be fairly stable and tumble slowly to begin with) and the measurement will be less accurate. The degree of binding is calculated by using the difference in anisotropy of the partially bound, free and fully bound (large excess of protein) states measured by titrating the two binding partners. If the fluorophore is bound to a relatively large molecule like a protein or an RNA, the change in the mobility accompanying folding can be used to study the dynamics of folding. This provides a measure of the dynamics of how the protein achieves its final, stable 3D shape. Fluorescence anisotropy is also applied to microscopy, with use of polarizers in the path of the illuminating light and also before the camera. This can be used to study the local viscosity of the cytosol or membranes, with the latter giving information about the membrane microstructure and the relative concentrations of various lipids. This technique has also been used to detect the binding of molecules to their partners in signaling cascades in response to certain cues. The phenomenon of emFRET and the associated decrease in anisotropy when close interactions occur between fluorophores has been used to study the aggregation of proteins in response to signaling.

It is taken by mouth. Side effects of dydrogesterone include menstrual irregularities, headache, nausea, breast tenderness, and others. Dydrogesterone is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. The medication is an atypical progestogen and does not inhibit ovulation. It has weak antimineralocorticoid activity and no other important hormonal activity. Dydrogesterone was developed in the 1950s and introduced for medical use in 1961. It is available widely throughout Europe, including in the United Kingdom, and is also marketed in Australia and elsewhere in the world. The medication was previously available in the United States, but it has been discontinued in this country. Medical uses Dydrogesterone has proven effective in a variety of conditions associated with progesterone deficiency, Infertility due to luteal insufficiency including threatened miscarriage, habitual or recurrent miscarriage, Menstrual disorders premenstrual syndrome, and endometriosis. Dydrogesterone has also been registered as a component of menopausal hormone therapy to counteract the effects of unopposed estrogen on the endometrium in women with an intact uterus. =Gynecological disorders= Primary or essential dysmenorrhea is a very common gynecological phenomenon experienced by women during their reproductive years. Clinical studies have shown symptom relief and a reduction in pain with dydrogesterone treatment for dysmenorrhea. Secondary amenorrhea is not a specific disease, but is instead a symptom. Dydrogesterone has been found to adequately induce bleeding within a sufficiently estrogen-primed endometrium. When estradiol levels are found to be low, dydrogesterone treatment is more effective when supplemented with estrogens. Endometriosis is a chronic disease which can cause severe, progressive, and at times, incapacitating dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, dyspareunia and infertility. Dydrogesterone relieves pain without inhibiting ovulation, so that patients are able to become pregnant during treatment. Dydrogesterone is particularly suitable in cases where the woman desires to become pregnant and to prevent bleeding problems. Dydrogesterone results in statistically significant reductions in the symptoms pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia after the first treatment cycle for the treatment of post-laparoscopic endometriosis. The amount and duration of menstrual bleeding is also significantly reduced, and from the end of the third month onwards, bleeding was considered normal in the majority of patients. Improvement of endometriosis was observed in 71% of patients and cure in 21%. Dydrogesterone has shown reasonable efficacy in relieving a number of premenstrual syndrome symptoms like mood swings and physical symptoms. Cyclic treatment with low-dose (10 mg/day) dydrogesterone has been found to be effective in the treatment of fibrocystic breast changes and associated breast pain. =Infertility and miscarriage= Oral dydrogesterone is an effective medication, well tolerated and accepted among patients, and can be considered for routine luteal support. Advantage of dydrogesterone is oral administration, easy to use and better patient compliance which results in high satisfaction score of oral dydrogesterone in luteal support of IVF/ICSI cycles. Oral administration of progestins dydrogesterone at least similar live birth rate than vaginal progesterone capsules when used for luteal support in embryo transfer, with no evidence of increased risk of miscarriage. Threatened miscarriage is defined as bleeding during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy while the cervix is closed. It is the most common complication in pregnancy, occurring in 20% of all pregnancies. Recurrent abortion is defined as the loss of three or more consecutive pregnancies. Dydrogesterone is associated with approximately two-fold significant reduction in the miscarriage rate as compared to standard care in threatened and recurrent miscarriages with minimal side effects. =Hormone therapy= The objective behind menopausal hormone therapy is to actively increase the circulating levels of estrogen to control hot flashes and to prevent the long-term effects of the menopause, such as bone resorption and unfavourable changes in blood lipids. The administration of estradiol halts, or reverses atrophic changes that occur due to the loss of endogenous estradiol during the menopause. Estrogen promotes endometrial cell growth and in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus, estrogen monotherapy results in continued endometrial development without the physiological secretory changes normally brought on by progesterone. This action is associated with an increased incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. Additional protection with progestogens is therefore important in patients with an intact uterus who receive estrogen therapy. Dydrogesterone counters the proliferative effect of estrogens on the endometrium and ensures the transition to a secretory pattern and cyclical shedding of the endometrium in serial menopausal hormone therapy regimes. Dydrogesterone effectively protects against the ontogenesis of endometrial hyperplasia. Unlike androgenic progestogens, dydrogesterone does not reverse the benefits brought on by estradiol on lipid profiles and carbohydrate metabolism. In a continuous, combined menopausal hormone therapy regimen, dydrogesterone retards the proliferation of the endometrium so that it remains atrophic or inactive. =Available forms= Dydrogesterone is available in the form of 10 mg oral tablets both alone and in combination with estradiol. Contraindications Side effects The most commonly reported medication-related adverse reactions in people taking dydrogesterone without an estrogen in clinical trials of indications have included menstrual irregularities, headaches, migraines, nausea, breast tenderness, bloating, and weight gain. The use of progestins, in particular medroxyprogesterone acetate, in treating postmenopausal symptoms have been associated with increased risk of blood clots and breast cancer in a study carried out by the Women's Health Initiative. While the study did not involve dydrogesterone, it is possible, but not certain, that it too increases these risks. Dydrogesterone has been prescribed and used in over 10 million pregnancies worldwide. There have been no harmful effects exhibited due to the use of dydrogesterone while pregnant. Dydrogesterone is safe to use during pregnancy only when prescribed and indicated by a medical practitioner. Studies have not shown any incidence of decreased fertility due to dydrogesterone at therapeutic dose. The Ames test found no evidence of any potential mutagenic or toxicity properties. Overdose There is not enough clinical data to support overdose in humans. The maximum dose of dydrogesterone administered to humans to date was 360 mg orally, and the medication was found to be well tolerated at this dose. There are no antidotes to overdose, and treatment should be based on symptoms. In acute toxicity trials, the LD50 doses in rats were in excess of 4,640 mg/kg orally.  Interactions  In menopausal hormone therapy, dydrogesterone is administered together with an estrogen. Therefore, the interaction between dydrogesterone and estrogens has been assessed, and no clinically significant interaction has been observed. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= 20Œ±-Dihydrodydrogesterone (20Œ±-DHD), the main active form of dydrogesterone. Dydrogesterone is a highly selective progestogen, and due to its unique structure, unlike progesterone and many other progestins, binds almost exclusively to the progesterone receptor (PR). The affinity of dydrogesterone for the PR is relatively low at about 16% of that of progesterone. However, in vivo, dydrogesterone is comparatively much more potent by the oral route, with an equivalent dose, in terms of endometrial proliferation, that is 10 to 20 times lower than that of progesterone. This is due to pharmacokinetic differences between the two medications, namely improved bioavailability and metabolic stability with dydrogesterone as well as additional progestogenic activity of its metabolites. Dydrogesterone binds to and activates both of the major isoforms of the PR, the PR-A and PR-B, with a similar selectivity ratio between the two receptors as that of progesterone and with lower efficacy at the receptors relative to progesterone. The major active metabolite of dydrogesterone, 20Œ±-dihydrodydrogesterone (20Œ±-DHD), has progestogenic activity as well but with greatly decreased potency relative to dydrogesterone. As with other progestogens, dydrogesterone has functional antiestrogenic effects in certain tissues, for instance in the endometrium, and induces endometrial secretory transformation. Dydrogesterone does not bind importantly to the androgen, estrogen, or glucocorticoid receptor. As such, it is devoid of androgenic or antiandrogenic, estrogenic or antiestrogenic, and glucocorticoid or antiglucocorticoid activity. Similarly to progesterone however, dydrogesterone binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor and possesses antimineralocorticoid activity, but only weakly so. Like other progestins but unlike progesterone, which forms sedative neurosteroid metabolites, dydrogesterone is not able to be metabolized in a similar way, and for this reason, is non-sedative. The medication and 20Œ±-DHD do not inhibit 5Œ±-reductase. Dydrogesterone has been found to inhibit myometrium contractility via an undefined progesterone receptor-independent mechanism in vivo in pregnant rats and in vitro in human tissue at concentrations at which progesterone and other progestogens do not. Atypical progestogenic profile Due to its progestogenic activity, dydrogesterone can produce antigonadotropic effects at sufficient doses in animals. However, it does not suppress secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), or inhibit ovulation at typical clinical dosages in humans. Oral doses of dydrogesterone of 5 to 40 mg/day on days 5 to 25 of the cycle fail to suppress ovulation (assessed by urinary pregnanediol and laparotomy), and one study found that ovulation persisted even in women treated with an oral dosage of as great as 400 mg/day (assessed by visual inspection of the ovaries). Likewise, an intramuscular injection of 100 mg dydrogesterone in microcrystalline aqueous suspension on the first to third day of the cycle did not interfere with the development of an ovulatory pattern of spontaneous uterine contractions in women. A couple of conflicting studies exist on the issue of ovulation inhibition by dydrogesterone however, with findings of partial or full inhibition of ovulation by oral dydrogesterone. This included prevention of the mid-cycle LH and FSH peaks and the luteal-phase rise in body temperature and pregnanediol excretion. Nonetheless, the overall consensus among researchers, based on the totality of clinical evidence, is that dydrogesterone does not inhibit ovulation in women. The apparent inability of dydrogesterone to prevent ovulation is in contrast to all other clinically used progestogens except trengestone, which is closely related to dydrogesterone. Similarly to trengestone but also unlike all other clinically used progestogens, dydrogesterone does not have a hyperthermic effect in humans (i.e., it does not increase body temperature). It has been said that the lack of ovulation inhibition and hyperthermic effect with retroprogesterone derivatives like dydrogesterone may represent a dissociation of peripheral and central progestogenic activity. However, a related retroprogesterone derivative, trengestone, likewise does not inhibit ovulation or produce a hyperthermic effect but rather has an inducing effect on ovulation. Whereas all other assessed progestins are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer when combined with an estrogen in postmenopausal women, neither oral progesterone nor dydrogesterone are associated with a significantly increased risk of breast cancer (although the risk of breast cancer is non-significantly higher with dydrogesterone). Similarly, like oral progesterone but in contrast to other progestins, dydrogesterone does not appear to further increase the risk of venous thromboembolism when used in combination with an oral estrogen. Dydrogesterone may also provide inferior endometrial protection relative to other progestins such as medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethisterone acetate, with a significantly increased risk of endometrial cancer in combination with an estrogen with long-term therapy (>5 years). Other activity Dydrogesterone weakly stimulates the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in vitro, an action that is independent of the classical PRs and is instead mediated via the progesterone receptor membrane component-1 (PGRMC1). Certain other progestins are also active in this assay, whereas progesterone acts neutrally. It is unclear if these findings may explain the different risks of breast cancer observed with progesterone, dydrogesterone, and other progestins such as medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethisterone in clinical studies. =Pharmacokinetics= Absorption Dydrogesterone and its major metabolite, 20Œ±-DHD, have predictable pharmacokinetics. The single-dose kinetics are linear in the oral dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg. The pharmacokinetics do not change during repeated administration of up to 20 mg dydrogesterone once daily. Dydrogesterone is readily absorbed with oral administration. The absolute bioavailability of dydrogesterone is on average 28%. Tmax values vary between 0.5 and 2.5 hours. Steady state is attained after 3 days of treatment. The levels of 20Œ±-DHD, which is the main active metabolite, are also found to peak about 1.5 hours post-dose. A single intramuscular injection of 100 mg dydrogesterone in microcrystalline aqueous suspension has been found to have a duration of action of 16 to 38 days in terms of clinical biological effect in the uterus in women. This was specifically the time until the onset of withdrawal bleeding in estrogen- treated amenorrheic women. Distribution The plasma protein binding of dydrogesterone and 20Œ±-DHD are unknown. Based on the plasma protein binding of other progestins however, they are probably bound to albumin and not to sex hormone-binding globulin or corticosteroid-binding globulin. Metabolism The metabolism of dydrogesterone occurs in the liver. It is virtually completely metabolized. The primary metabolic pathway is the hydrogenation of the 20-keto group mainly by AKR1C1 and to a lesser extent AKR1C3, resulting in 20Œ±-DHD. This active metabolite is a progestogen similarly to dydrogesterone, albeit with much lower potency. With oral administration of dydrogesterone, circulating levels of 20Œ±-DHD are substantially higher than those of dydrogesterone. The ratios of 20Œ±-DHD to dydrogesterone in terms of peak levels and area-under-the-curve (AUC) levels have been found to be 25:1 and 40:1, respectively. For these reasons, despite the lower relative progestogenic potency of 20Œ±-DHD, dydrogesterone may act as a prodrug of this metabolite. The metabolism of dydrogesterone differs from progesterone. Whereas the major metabolite of progesterone is pregnanediol, the corresponding derivative of dydrogesterone, retropregnanediol, cannot be detected in urine with oral administration of dydrogesterone. All of the metabolites of dydrogesterone retain the 4,6-diene-3-one structure and are metabolically stable. As such, similarly to progesterone, dydrogesterone does not undergo aromatization. The mean elimination half-lives of dydrogesterone and 20Œ±-DHD are in the ranges of 5 to 7 hours and 14 to 17 hours, respectively. Excretion Dydrogesterone and its metabolites are excreted predominantly in urine. Total clearance of plasma is at a rate of 6.4 L/min. Within 72 hours, excretion is virtually complete. 20Œ±-DHD is preponderantly present in the urine as a conjugate of glucuronic acid. Approximately 85% of the oral dose is successfully removed from the body within 24 hours. Around 90% of excreted material is 20Œ±-DHD. Miscellaneous The pharmacokinetics of dydrogesterone have been reviewed. Chemistry A 3D schematic representation of the chemical structures of progesterone (top) and dydrogesterone (bottom), showing the retrosteroid spatial configuration of dydrogesterone. Dydrogesterone, also known as 6-dehydro-9Œ≤,10Œ±-progesterone or as 9Œ≤,10Œ±-pregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone and retroprogesterone (9Œ≤,10Œ±-progesterone). Retroprogesterone derivatives like dydrogesterone are analogues of progesterone in which the hydrogen atom at the 9th carbon has been switched from the Œ±-position (below the plane) to the Œ≤-position (above the plane) and the methyl group at the 10th carbon has been switched from the Œ≤-position to the Œ±-position. This reversed configuration in dydrogesterone results in a \\"bent\\" spatial geometry in which the plane of rings A and B is orientated at a 60¬∞ angle below the rings C and D. Dydrogesterone also has an additional double bond between the C6 and C7 positions (4,6-dien-3-one configuration). While its chemical structure is close to that of progesterone, these changes result in dydrogesterone having improved oral activity and metabolic stability, among other differences, in comparison to progesterone. =Analogues= Other retroprogesterone derivatives, and analogues of dydrogesterone, include trengestone (1,6-didehydro-6-chlororetroprogesterone) and Ro 6-3129 (16Œ±-ethylthio-6-dehydroretroprogesterone). =Synthesis= Dydrogesterone is synthesized and manufactured by treatment of progesterone with ultraviolet light exposure. Chemical syntheses of dydrogesterone have been published. History Dydrogesterone is a progestin which was first synthesized by Duphar in the 1950s and was first introduced to the market in 1961. It is unique, being the only retrosteroid that is commercially available and its molecular structure is closely related to that of natural progesterone, but it has enhanced oral bioavailability. It is estimated that during the period from 1977 to 2005 around 38 million women were treated with dydrogesterone and that fetuses were exposed to dydrogesterone in utero in more than 10 million pregnancies. It has been approved in more than 100 countries worldwide. It is commercially marketed under the brand name Duphaston and manufactured by Abbott after it took over Solvay Pharmaceuticals. Dydrogesterone was first introduced, by Duphar, as Duphaston in the United Kingdom in 1961. Subsequently, it was introduced in the United States as Duphaston and Gynorest in 1962 and 1968, respectively. Duphaston was removed from the United States market in 1979, and Gynorest is also no longer available in the United States. Society and culture =Generic names= Dydrogesterone is the generic name of the drug and its , , and , while dydrogest√©rone is its and didrogesterone is its .https://www.drugs.com/international/dydrogesterone.html It was also originally known as isopregnenone. Dydrogesterone has also been referred to as retroprogesterone, but should not be confused with retroprogesterone. =Brand names= Dydrogesterone is marketed mainly under the brand names Duphaston (alone) and Femoston (in combination with estradiol). It also is or has been marketed alone under the brand names Dabroston, Dufaston, Duvaron, Gestatron, Gynorest, Prodel, Retrone, and Terolut and in combination with estradiol under the brand names Climaston, Femaston, and Femphascyl. =Availability= Dydrogesterone is available widely throughout the world. It is marketed in the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, and Australia, but not in the United States, Canada, or New Zealand. The medication was previously available in the United States, but has since been discontinued in this country. Dydrogesterone is also available in elsewhere in Europe, as well as in Central and South America, Asia, and North Africa.

It is located close to the waterfront esplanade of the capital city on the rue du G√©n√©ral de Gaulle. The construction of the cathedral began in the middle of the 19th century and it opened in 1875. It is the oldest Catholic church in Tahiti and one of Papeete's last remaining examples of early colonial architecture. ' History In the 19th century, France began expanding its colonial empire into Asia and the Pacific Islands, declaring the Kingdom of Tahiti a protectorate in 1842. French missionaries began arriving in the same year and an apostolic vicariate was established on May 9, 1848. Construction of the cathedral most likely started after this time and it was completed in 1875. Named after its famous Parisian counterpart, ' the cathedral was built near the waterfront in midtown Papeete. Architecture =Exterior= The entrance of the cathedral features a red steeple ' at the centre that faces towards Mount Aorai. =Interior= The interior of the church is noted for its mixture of European and local Polynesian features in its design. This is demonstrated in a full-size woodcarving of the Madonna and Child, the latter of whom is clutching a breadfruit. This work of art originated from the Marquesas Islands. The cathedral is also known for its artistic representations of the Stations of the Cross. Created by Yuel Durnad and St. Fond, the stations incorporate both Tahitian and Roman cultures in the style of dress, but solely depict Polynesian people in the scenes of The Passion. The artistic style of the paintings was influenced by Paul Gauguin.

It is located in the town of Quimper and is the seat of the Diocese of Quimper and L√©on. Saint Corentin was its first bishop. The cathedral is notable in that, unlike other Gothic cathedrals, it slightly bends in the middle to match the contours of its location, and avoid an area that was swampy at the time of the construction. The cathedral was the site of a devastating fire in 1620 when the bell tower was burned and the populace saw a green devil in the flames. Statue of Saint Corentin in the cathedral According to legend King Gradlon met Saint Corentin on the mountain Mƒónez-Hom and was so impressed by the strength of his religious faith that he invited the hermit to become Bishop of Quimper. The cathedral replaced an old Roman church which had a chapel attached to it called the \\"Chapelle de la Victoire\\" where Alain Canhiart was buried in 1058. It was in 1239 that the first part of the cathedral was built when Bishop Rainaud commissioned the building of the choir, but it was not until the coming of Duke Jean V at the beginning of the 15th century that momentum gathered and the choir was covered with crisscross vaulting. In the same century, the western side of the cathedral and the nave emerged. The French Revolution and the subsequent Terror put paid to further progress, but after the Concordat of 1801, restoration of the cathedral followed as well as some additional construction. When the cathedral was completed the choir was out of line with the nave, having a slight curve to the left, this to avoid disturbing the older chapel which contained the tomb of Alain Canhiart. Thus the cathedral has an odd shape, and rather imaginatively some have likened the top part of the cathedral's inclination to the left as suggesting Christ's head leaning to the left when he hung on the cross. The cathedral exterior There are several entrances (portals) to the cathedral: the three north portals, the south portal known as the \\"Porche de la Vi√®rge\\" and the magnificent west portal. =The north portals= There are three portals on the cathedral's north side, \\"La fa√ßade septentrionale\\".. On the far right is the \\"Porche des Bapt√™mes\\", which leads to the north nave. The portal comprises a double door separated by a trumeau. Above the doors in a triangular pediment are the arms of Canon Pierre du Quenquis, whilst at the top of the pediment are the arms of Jean V with the motto \\"A ma vie\\" and the crest of his wife Jeanne de France in a diamond-shaped lozenge carried by a dove. Just below this are the arms of Monseigneur Bertrand de Rosmadec with the motto \\"En Bon Espoir\\". To the left and right of the pediment are the arms of the Barons of Nƒóvet and Guengat. The \\"Porche de la Chandeleur\\" is located at the northern end of the transept and was built between 1475 and 1479 by the mason Pierre Le Goaraguer and his son Guillaume. The single door is surmounted by a triangular pediment and the arch's external voussures are decorated with carvings of acanthus leaves. Above the door is an ornate finial above which is a \\"hermine passant\\" (i.e., a stoat passant). The third portal, situated between the \\"Porche des Bapt√™mes\\" and the \\"Porche de la Chandeleur\\", is small and in earlier times gave access to the ossuary and cemetery; it is no longer used. =The western fa√ßade of Saint-Corentin cathedral and the west portal= The west fa√ßade and portal The west fa√ßade of the cathedral comprises two great spires and a magnificent portal with a series of angels decorating the arch's voussoirs. On the trumeau is a statue of Christ giving a blessing whilst holding a globe and treading on a grimacing demon. Before 1793, the sculpture on the trumeau had been an equestrian figure in granite of Jean V but that was destroyed in that year.The remains of this statue are now held in the nearby Musƒóe Dƒópartmental Breton. At the top of an arch between the two spires there is a statue of the legendary King Gradlon The first stone of the western facade was laid on 26 July 1424 by Monseigneur Bertrand de Rosmadec in the presence of a representative of Jean V, the Duke of Bretagne. Both within and without the triangular pediment above the voussoirs, are many crests and mottos including the crest of the helmeted lion of Montfort holding a standard bearing the words \\"Malo au riche duc!\\", the battle-cry of Breton dukes, the arms of Jean V, the Duke of Bretagne's three sons, the crest of Jeanne de France, Guillaume de Rosmadec, Bertrand de Rosmadec, the barons of Nƒóvet with the motto \\"Pƒórag?\\" \\"Pourquoi?\\" and the motto of the nobles of Bodigneau and Clohars-Fouesnant \\"A l'aventure!\\", whilst on the right and near a helmet decorated with valances is the motto of the nobles of Guengat \\"Lƒóal √† ma Foy\\" and the arms of the nobles of Quƒólenec. =The cathedral's south portal= The south portal is part of the \\"facade mƒóridionale\\" or \\"south facade\\" and is known as the \\"Porche de la Vierge\\" or the \\"Porche de Sainte Catherine\\". It has a statue of the Virgin Mary with child in the tympanum, with angels wafting censers on either side. She is seated and below her feet is the bust of an angel with spread wings. The child she holds is gently stroking a bird which he carries. In a niche in one of the buttresses there is a statue of Catherine of Alexandria carved from kersanton. Above the door is a triangular pediment with three ƒócussons (\\"crests or shields\\") including the crest of the Duchess Jeanne de France surmounted by the \\"hermine passante\\" (\\"passing stoat\\"), the emblem of Brittany, with the inscription \\"A ma vie\\". Also shown are the arms and mottos of Monseigneur de Rosmadec and Guillaume de Rosmadec. Just outside of the pediment are the crests of the Bodigneau family and the family Quƒólennec. The voussoirs in the upper part of the portal's arch depict 8 angels playing instruments. The niches in the lower voussoirs are empty. The cathedral interior The Saint-Corentin cathedral has numerous stained glass windows and chapels and to avoid confusion, this guide will describe items of interest starting from the west portal and work around the church starting from the left and moving in a clock-wise direction. We shall describe items of interest along the north side of the nave, then the north side of the transept followed by the north side of the choir. We then move around the ambulatory, past the abside and the Notre-Dame de la Victoire chapel and return to the west portal via the south sides of the choir, transept and nave. We shall deal with the mostly 19th-century stained glass as we make this circuit and then return to describe the far older stained glass of the cathedral's upper level. The north-facing side of the nave ‚Äì lower level After entering the cathedral through the west portal, and passing two stoups on either side of the entrance, these topped with sculptures of angels, we turn to the left (north) side of the nave and reach the Chapelle des Fonts baptismaux; in effect the Baptistery =Chapelle des Fonts baptismaux/Baptistery.Bay 33= The \\"Chapelle des Fonts baptismaux\\" has a rather modest marble font and on the left side of the chapel an alabaster statue of John the Baptist stands with his back to a leafy tree, bedecked with birds. There is a cavalier at his feet. This work is, in fact, English and was obtained by Monseigneur Ren√© Nicolas Sergent from the church at K√©rity-Penmarc'h. It is also known as the \\"Saint Jean des Oiseaux\\". It is two metres high. John the Baptist wears the skin of a camel whose head dangles by John the Baptist's feet. He carries a prayer book and a lamb. The stained glass window is modern, dating to 1981, and is the work of the artist Josette Mahuzier of the Gruber atelier. The theme of the window is the part played by water in certain parts of the bible and the concept of the baptism. On the north side of the chapel is the gisant of Monseigneur Roul Le Mo√´l, chaplain to Charles VIII, and the Bishop of Cornouaille from 1493 to 1501. The original gisant had been destroyed during the revolution and the replacement is carved from the distinctive dark kersanton stone. One can see Raoul Le Mo√´l's coat of arms in the chapel keystone. In the chapel there is also a carving in wood and dating to the 17th-century representing Notre Dame du Gu√©odet which had come from a church, now destroyed, the √âglise Notre-Dame du Gu√©odet. =Grisaille. Bay 31= As we turn along the north side of the nave we encounter a Grisaille. See also Bay 32. =Chapelle des \\"Trois Gouttes de Sang\\". Bay 29= The next chapel in sequence, the chapel called the Chapelle des \\"Trois Gouttes de Sang\\", recalls and depicts the story of a rich Quimper knight who had left his money and possessions with a friend before going off to the crusades. On his return several years later, this friend denied all knowledge of the transaction. The knight having kept nothing in writing and having no witnesses, took the dispute before the \\"Tribunal de l'Ev√™que\\" where the recipient of the money was challenged to make an oath in the cathedral, confirming his denial. He did so before several witnesses and before a crucifix which at that time stood before the cathedral chevet. As he made the oath and as a reaction to this act of perjury, three drops of blood were shed by the figure of Christ on the crucifix onto the altar tablecloth. This blood was subsequently collected into a reliquary and is placed on the Chapelle des \\"Trois Gouttes de Sang\\"'s altar, along with the tablecloth and along with Jesus' head from the crucifix which had been broken off by French revolutionaries when they desecrated the cathedral. This head has in fact been carefully analysed and dates to the 12th-century. Hirsch's stained glass window in this chapel dates to 1869 and depicts the friend's act of perjury before the knight and his wife, a bishop and judges. There are also two Yann Dargent frescoes in the chapel, one depicting the nativity and the second the visit of the three wise men and the shepherds. In the chapel there is also a statue of Sainte-Th√©r√®se holding the infant Jesus and a plaque marking the tomb bricked up into the chapel wall of Monseigneur Francis Barbu who was the Bishop of Quimper from 1968 to 1989. On this plaque is a medallion depicting Barbu by the sculptor Pierre Toulhoat. Barbu is the last bishop to be buried in the cathedral =Vitrail de saint Gu√©nol√© et de saint Ronan. Bay 27= The 19th-century window in the next bay celebrates the lives of the two evangelist saints, Gu√©nol√© and Ronan who preached in Basse Bretagne. Saint Gu√©nol√© had founded the abbey at Land√©vennec and Saint Ronan was a hermit who lived at Locronan. In front of the window is a statue of Joan of Arc dressed for battle and carrying a flag. The window depicts various episodes in the lives of Gu√©nol√© and Ronan. Depictions include Ronan being baptised, his hermitage at L√©on, Saint Patrick appearing to Gu√©nol√© and Gu√©nol√© helping Grallon to die. The window dates to 1874 and was the work of Hirsch. The eight panels to the left relate to Saint Gu√©nol√© and those on the right side to Saint Ronan. =Vitrail de saint Paul-Aur√©lien. Bay 25= The next window celebrates the life of Paul Aur√©lian (known as Paol Aorelian or Saint Pol de L√©on). He was a 6th-century Welshman who became the first bishop of the diocese of L√©on and was one of the seven founder saints of Brittany. Paul became a pupil of Saint Iidut at Llantwit Major and lived on Caldey Island with Samson of Dol and Gildas. He went to Brittany, establishing monasteries in Finist√®re at Ouessant on the north-west coast of Brittany, and at Lampaul on the island of Ushant, on the island of Batz and at Ocsimor, now the city of Saint-Pol-de-L√©on, where he is said to have founded a monastery in an abandoned fort. He was consecrated bishop there under the authority of Childebert, King of the Franks. The stained glass window depicts scenes from St Pol's life, including events with Ildut, his conversion of King Mark, his receiving an order to leave Great Britain, and his death in Batz. The window is attributed to Hirsch and dates to 1874. =Vitrail de Saint Yves. Bay 23= Saint Yves was a 13th-century saint and is the patron saint of Brittany. Canonised in recognition of his virtue, he was a lawyer and a judge renown for his advocacy on behalf of the poor. The stained glass window depicts some scenes concerning Saint-Yves' life. Scenes include Yves being ordained as a priest, the time when he sold his horse in Tr√©guier to help the poor, Jesus appearing to Yves as a leper, his giving up his room for a beggar, the miracle where he caused trees to grow to replace those cut down to build the cathedral and his death on 19 May 1303. The coats of arms of Poulguinan and Monseigneur Fran√ßois Hyacinthe de Ploeuc are also shown. Beneath the window dedicated to Saint Yves is the tomb and gisant of Monseigneur Fran√ßois Hyacinthe de Ploeuc, Bishop of Quimper from 1709 to 1739. The door placed here has a fine carving of the head of a cherub and on the wall to the right of the door is a sculpture depicting Saint Yves sitting between a rich and a poor man. The north side of the transept We then arrive at the north transept and the Porche de la Chandeleur and the Chapelle des Trƒópassƒós or the Chapelle de la Sainte Croix. This chapel served for years as a place for funeral services (Chapelle des Trƒópassƒós means \\"the chapel of the dead\\") and has a large altar and some stalls. The altar is dedicated to Sainte-Croix and points to the north and its paintings are attributed to the artist Icart. In the chapel are statues of Saint Guƒónolƒó, the first abbot of Landƒóvennec and Saint Conogan, the second Bishop of Quimper. He was a saint who was invoked to cure people of the fever. There is also a statue of Saint Anthony with a small pig at his feet and a female saint holding a tower. Also high up on the north wall of the transept is the stained glass window entitled \\"Vingt-Huit Saints Armoricains, Lƒóonards et Cornouaillais\\" (Bay 117) The north-facing side of the choir ‚Äì lower level On the lower level of the north side of the choir are four chapels; La chapelle de Saint-Pierre, the Chapelle de Saint-Fr√©d√©ric, the Chapelle de Saint-Roch and the Chapelle de Saint-Corentin =La chapelle de Saint-Pierre. Bay 21= In the chapel window, Monseigneur Graveran offers the maquette of the spires of the cathedral to the Virgin Mary and Saint Corentin. Behind Graveran is Saint Joseph After crossing the transept, we arrive at the Chapelle de Saint-Pierre. The chapel walls evoke \\"la collation des pouvoirs de lier et d√©lier √† saint Pierre\\". The stained glass window of 1856 by Lobin of Tours recalls the restoration of the cathedral's spires at the time of Monseigneur Joseph Marie Graveran. In the stained glass window, the bishop, presented by Saint Joseph, kneels and offers a maquette of the spires to the Virgin Mary and Saint Corentin. The window was a gift to the cathedral from Mme Mascarƒóne de Rivi√®re. Graveran's grave nearby, the work of Amƒódƒóe Mƒónard, is marked by a limestone statue. There is also a plaque dedicated to Monseigner Andr√© Fauvel who was bishop of Quimper and Lƒóon from 1947 to 1968 . Finally, the chapel has a painting showing Saint Peter kneeling in front of Jesus. The altar is of onyx and decorated with images. That in the centre depicts Jesus handing the keys to heaven to Saint Pierre (Peter), that on the left depicts Jesus entrusting Saint Pierre with the lambs and sheep and Saint Pierre walking on water. The chapel has frescoes by Yann Dargent, one above the altar and the other in the arcade tympanum. They depict Jesus handing the keys to Saint Pierre in the presence of the other apostles and Pierre bereft and in tears after he had denied Jesus. There are no statues in this chapel. Apart from Graveran's tomb, evidence of two bricked in tombs (\\"enfeus\\") can be seen in the chapel's north wall. The coats of arms here were chiselled away during the days of the revolution. In these tombs are the remains of Alain Le Baud, Yvon Le Baud, Fran√ßois Cochet and Jehanne du Cluziou, a noblewoman from Poulgazet. The tomb of Graveran is inscribed-\\"HIC JACET JOSEPHUS-MARIA GRAVERAN EPISCOPUS CORISOPITENSIS ET LEONENSIS, ANNOS VIXIT LXI, MENSE X, DIES XVI, OBIIT DIE I FEBRUARII IN PACE\\". =Chapelle de Saint-Fr√©d√©ric. Bay 19= The next chapel in bay 21 is the Chapelle de Saint-Fr√©d√©ric. The stained glass window and paintings in this chapel celebrate the life and martyrdom of Saint- Fr√©d√©ric (Fr√©d√©ric d'Utrecht). Saint-Fr√©d√©ric had originally come from Utrecht and had served as the Bishop of Walcheren in the time of Louis le D√©bonnaire. The chapel has a fine altar combining marble and gilded bronze and on the sides of the altar are statues depicting Saint Mathurin and Saint Fr√©d√©ric, the latter holding an open book and pointing to the page opened. The two paintings in the chapel are by Yann Dargent and depict Fr√©d√©ric d'Utrecht's martyrdom and a scene where he reproaches Queen Judith. The stained glass window, a gift to the cathedral from Louise Bonnemaison of Quimper, holds 16 medallions depicting scenes from Fr√©d√©ric d'Utrecht's life, including his ordination, his reproaches to Queen Judith, his being attacked and murdered during mass at a church in Maestricht and his body being taken to Utrecht. Signatures on the window include that of E.Hirsch and Mongin Maillƒó. Louise Bonnemaison had also helped to fund the restoration of the chapel. The chapel also contains the tombs of Bishop Y.Cabellic and Canon Olivier de Conquer. =Chapelle de Saint-Roch. Bay 17= The stained glass window in the Chapelle de Saint Roch, the Vitrail de saint Roch, contains 16 medallions depicting scenes from the saint's life. The window is attributed to Hirsch and dates to 1869. The scenes include his birth, the pilgrimage to Rome, his attempt to cure victims of the plague in a hospital, his catching that disease himself, a visit from an angel, a dog bringing him nourishment; his being visited by Monseigneur Gothard, his converting Gothard, his being sick in hospital, his recognition by the prison governor his uncle and his funeral. Two frescoes by Yann Dargent complete the chapel's decoration. One shows Saint-Roch curing the sick and the second his stay in a forest as a recluse. The Montpellier born Saint Roch was a saint especially invoked against the plague. There are statues in the chapel of Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Roch himself. The chapel also holds the tomb of Monseigneur Valleau who died in 1898. The chapel altar is made from limestone and is decorated with polychrome paintings. =Chapelle de Saint-Corentin. Bay 15= The Chapelle de Saint-Corentin altar, made by the goldsmith Poussielque, has a reliquary cabinet (\\"armoire reliquaire\\") holding the arm Saint Corentin. This reliquary is decorated with a bas-relief depicting Jacques Dhuisseau handing the saint's arm to the bishop Guillaume Le Prestre de L√©zonnet in the presence of Guillaume Le Gouverneur, the bishop of Saint-Malo, and various clerics. The arm is held in a crystal cylinder which is carried by models of various bishops. The chapel is also the site of the tomb and gisant of Monseigneur Nouvel de La Fl√®che, a Benedictine monk who served as bishop of Quimper from 1872 to 1887. It was Nouvel de la Fl√®che who had had Yann Dargent execute the various frescoes in the cathedral, originally commissioned by his predecessor, Monseigneur Sergent, who had had the apsidal chapel restored by Bigot and had had the relic of Saint Corentin placed in the Saint Corentin chapel. Canon Jean de Marc'hallac'h is also buried in the chapel. The stained glass window relates, in 16 medallions, the story of Saint-Corentin's life. Dargent's frescoes here, placed above the altar, depict angels carrying the saint up to heaven and Saint-Corentin meeting Saint Primel. On either side of the altar are statues of Saint Corentin with a fish at his feet and Saint Primel.' The windows show his connections to King Gradlon, to Saint Gu√©nol√© and Tudy. Scenes include Corentin building his hermitage, praying before a menhir, visiting Primel, his receiving Gradlon, his blessing of the Abbots Gu√©nol√© and Tudy, on his deathbed but still blessing clerics and his funeral. A plaque nearby reminds us of the legend that relates to how Saint-Corentin fed himself with fish from his fountain. Each day he caught a fish, ate half of it and threw the rest back in the fountain. The next day he was able to catch the fish again which was now whole. The north ambulatory Next we start to walk around the north ambulatory and encounter the painting by Yann Dargent called \\"Miracle en faveur du P Maunoir\\". In Dargent's painting, P√®re Julien Mannoir, a missionary, is miraculously given the gift of the Breton language by an angel to enable him preach in Brittany. P√®re Julien Mannoir, a missionary, is miraculously given the gift of the Breton language by an angel. The painting by Yann Dargent =Vitrail de Saint Guƒóna√´l. Bay 13= Vitrail de Saint Guƒóna√´l. Guena√´l asks to accompany Saint Gu√©nol√© to his monastery. Note how the group of boys interrupt their game of boules to watch the event unfolding before their eyes Next we encounter the door to the sacristry and a walled-up window protected by a massive grill. It seems that this walled up window had given access to one of the corridors of the sacristy. Above this grilled arch there is a stained glass window, the work of Louis Plonquet in 1904, this known as the \\"Vitrail de Saint Guƒóna√´l\\". This shows a young man, Saint Guena√´l asking Saint Gu√©nol√©, then the abbot of Land√©vennec and on a visit to Quimper, to take him to his monastery so that he could live in the service of God.(\\"y passer sa vie au service de Dieu\\"). Saint Guƒóna√´l became abbot of Land√©vennec after Saint Gu√©nol√©'s death. Here there are also murals by Yann Dargent depicting Corentin in conversation with Primel and his being carried to heaven by angels. The sacristy door area of Quimper Cathedral. In the centre is a walled up window covered by a grill. To the right we see the sacristy door and above the door are the arms of Monseigneur Bertrand de Rosmadec with the motto \\"En Bon Espoir\\". To the left we see the bottom of Yann Dargent's painting showing the miracle where Father Julien Maunoir is given the gift of the Breton language. Above the grilled window is the window depicting Saints Gu√©nol√© and Guƒóna√´l =Vocation de Saint M√©lar. Bay 11= The Vocation de Saint M√©lar This window tells the story of Saint M√©lar who as a boy had his right hand cut off to stop him holding a sword and his left foot removed to stop him mounting a horse. In the window he and his father, Saint Miliau, with some soldiers and monks, stand before the bishop. M√©lar, now wearing a false hand, holds out the severed hand. Saint Miliau had been killed by his brother Rivode who was also responsible for the attack on Saint M√©lar. This window is by Louis Plonquet and dates to 1904. =Mort de Saint Corentin. Bay 11= The \\"Mort de Saint Corentin\\" window In Bay 11 on the north side of the ambulatory and to the right of the entry to the sacristy is the window entitled \\"Mort de Saint Corentin\\". The dying Saint Corentin is depicted in the central panel and around this are lancets depicting the six main sanctuaries of Cornouaille devoted to the Virgin Mary. These are Notre-Dame de Rumengol, Notre-Dame de Quimperlƒó, Notre-Dame de Confort, Notre Dames des Portes, Notre-Dame des Cieux and Notre-Dame de Ch√¢teaulin. =Proclamation du dogme de l'Immaculƒóe Conception. Bay 9= In Bay 9 of the north side of the ambulatory is this window attributed to Lavergne. In the centre of the window two panels recall the history of the dogma surrounding the concept of the Immaculate Conception whilst around this several panels celebrate the sanctuaries in Lƒóon and Trƒógor devoted to the Virgin Mary. One panel recalls Notre-Dame de Berven, and others Notre-Dame de Kreisker, Notre-Dame auxiliatrice at Lesneven, Notre-Dame du Mur, Notre-Dame du Folgo√´t and Notre-Dame de Kernitron. The abside and the absidial chapel ‚Äì Chapelle de Notre ‚Äì Dame des Victoires At the eastern end of the cathedral we come to the apse or the chevet. Radiating apse chapels outside the choir aisle were common in France at the beginning of the 13th century, the complete structure of apse, choir and radiating chapel becoming known as the chevet which can be translated as \\"headpiece\\". Famous northern French examples of chevets are in the Gothic cathedrals of Amiens, Beauvais and Reims. In the Saint-Corentin cathedral, the apsidal chapel is called the 'Chapelle de Notre-Dame des Victoires. It had first been known as the Chapel de Notre-Dame, then the Chapelle Neuve, then the Chapelle de la Trinit√©, or the Chapelle du Saint-Sacrement, the latter because the chapel's altar has a tabernacle containing the \\"Saintes Esp√®ces\\". It is a place for prayer and contemplation. It was built in 1028 by the Compte de Cornouaiile. Alain Canhiart was buried in the chapel in 1058, following a vow made by Canhiart that his armies would be successful in the battle of Locronan. When in 1239, Monseigneur Raynaud planned the construction of the choir of the new cathedral, the decision was made to add the old chapel to the choir, this being one of the reasons for the odd shape of the cathedral with the choir leaning slightly to the left of the transept. This joining of the chapel to the cathedral choir meant that it needed some reconstruction including vaulting and some elegant columns (Colonnettes), and enlargement of the ambulatory and an arcade where the chapel joined the choir. The altar is of granite and was consecrated by Monseigneur Alain Rivelen in 1295. The chapel holds the tombs of Bishop Even de la For√™t who died in 1290 and Bishop Gatien de Monceaux who died in 1416. There are also inscriptions on the altar which state that the hearts of two further bishops, Monseigneur Dombideau and Monseigneur de Pouliquet are contained in lead boxes which were built into the chapel wall. There are five stained glass windows in the Notre-Dame de la Victoire chapel. These are:- =Nativitƒó aux Bergers. Bay 0= The central stained glass window in the chapel, that on the east wall, depicts the nativity and is known as the Vitrail de la Nativit√© du Sauveur or Vitrail de l'Adoration des Bergers/Nativitƒó aux Bergers, a work dating to 1868 by the Strasbourg born artist Louis Charles Auguste Steinheil and commissioned by Monseigneur Renƒó Nicolas Sergent. The Virgin Mary is beautifully drawn in a blue robe and proudly showing her child to the kneeling shepherds. Joseph looks on and in the first of the four lancets a passing woman (La \\"Belle Jardini√®re\\") looks across at the scene. She holds the hand of a small child. The historian Le Man described this as the most beautiful of the cathedral's modern windows (\\"incontestablement le plus beau vitrail moderne de la cathƒódrale\\"). In the window's tracery two angels, their green wings spread, plunge earthwards. One holds a banner inscribed \\"Gloria in excelsis Deo\\" whilst the second has her hands clasped in adoration. =Communion de la Vierge. Bay 1= This two lancet window is in bay 1 on the north side of the chapel and is placed above the enfeu of Monseigneur Gatien de Monceaux. It depicts John the Evangelist giving communion to the Virgin Mary or Communion de la Vierge, remise par saint Jean, assist√© d‚ÄôEtienne. It is signed G.C.L (Georges Claudius Lavergne) and dates to around 1891. In the tracery are the arms of three Quimper bishops, Gatien de Monceaux, Pierre-Vincent Dombidau and Jean-Marie Dominique de Poulpiquet. Across John's chasuble run some of the words from John 6. verse 48 to 59.\\"EGO SUM [PANIS VITAE]\\" (\\"I am the bread of life\\") and \\"HIC EST PANIS QUI CAELJO DESCENDIT\\" (\\"Here is the bread which has come from heaven\\"). =Dormition de la Vierge. Bay 2= This four lancet window is in bay 2 on the south side of the Notre-Dame de la Victoire chapel.

Bay 3= This two lancet window by Lavergne dates to 1891 and occupies bay 3 on the north side of the Notre-Dame de la Victoire chapel. It is positioned above the enfeu of Monseigneur Even de la For√™t. The king holds a maquette of the chapel and presents it to Saint Corentin who stands next to a statue of the Virgin Mary with child. With Gradlon are Saint Guƒónolƒó and Darƒórƒóa, Gradlon's wife. =Voeu d'Alain Canhiart d'ƒóriger La Chapelle Notre-Dame de la Victoire. Bay 4= In bay 4 on the south side of the chapel Notre-Dame de la Victoire is the window \\"Voeu d'Alain Canhiart d'ƒóriger La Chapelle Notre-Dame de la Victoire\\" a window celebrating Alain Canhiart's vow to erect a chapel if successful in his battle against the Duke of Bretagne, Alain III. The window is signed Georges Cl.Lavergne.1891. The central and south ambulatory We now leave the Notre-Dame de la Victoire chapel and enter the ambulatory. We encounter two windows in this area, one on either side of the chapel entrance. To the left of the entrance to the chapel Notre-Dame de la Victoire is the Hirsch window \\"Prƒósentation de Julien Maunoir √† Monseigneur Lou√´t par Michel Le Nobletz\\". =Prƒósentation de Julien Maunoir √† Monseigneur du Lou√´t par Michel Le Nobletz. Bay 5= \\"Prƒósentation de Julien Maunoir a Mgr Lou√´t par Michel Le Nobletz\\" This window was erected as a tribute to Renƒó du Lou√´t, the Bishop of Cornouaille from 1640 to 1668. His tomb is located below the window. The window depicts Michel Le Nobletz presenting Julien Maunoir to du Louƒìt. Le Nobletz and Maunoir were important Breton missionaries. Michel Le Nobletz was born in 1577 in Plouguerneau in L√©on and Maunoir was born in 1606 in Saint-Georges-de-Reintembault. =Protestation contre La Constitution civile du Clergƒó. Bay 6= This four lancet window by Hirsch depicts Touissant Conen de Saint Luc, Bishop of Cornouille, delivering the \\"Protestation contre La Constitution civile du Clergƒó\\" to Pope Pie V1. The window is located to the right of the entrance to the apsidal chapel. =La chapelle Notre-Dame du Rosaire. Bay 7= Next we arrive at the La chapelle Notre-Dame du Rosaire or Chapelle de N.D. des Carmes in the ambulatory's north side, where we find the Vitrail du Rosaire depicting the Virgin Mary handing the rosary to Saint Dominic and Saint Catherine of Sienna and around this central scene, 15 medallions depict the various \\"mysteries\\", those of joy, of sadness and of glory. This window was given to the cathedral by Abbƒó Jules Guillard. Monseigneur Ren√© Nicolas Sergent was buried in the chapel Notre-Dame des Carmes on 2 August 1871 in an enfeu created shortly before his death. He is depicted laying on a tomb carved from kersanton stone and made by Quimper masons. His statue came from the Lorient workshop of Le Brun. On the base of the enfeu, a marble plaque is inscribed \\"Renatus-Nicolaus Sergent. Episcopus. Corisopitensis, et. Leonensis.Sancti. Corentini, nostri. sedem. XVI. annos. immigre. tenuit. Ecclesiam. Cathedralem. magnificentissimus. ornavit. Fidem. inconcussam. in. synodo. Vaticano . fideliter. firmiterque. professus. est. Obiit. die. XXV. Julii. anno. M. DCCCLXXI. in. pace\\". Between Sergent's tomb and the chapel's altar, is a white marble statue of the Virgin Mary holding baby Jesus in her arms. This was a gift to the cathedral from a Mr Guillou of Quimper and was the work of Auguste Ottin. =Chapelle des Saints Anges. Bay 8= Leaving the apsidal chapel we turn south along the ambulatory to reach the \\"Chapelle des Saints Anges\\". The chapel's altarpiece is an alabaster work dating to the 15th century which features a seated Christ giving a blessing alongside figures representing the four cardinal virtues. This altarpiece was originally the pedestal for the statue of John the Baptist in the baptistry. The stained glass window, attributed to Hirsch and dated 1871, depicts various scenes from the Acts of the Apostles showing the intervention of angels and in particular the guardian angel in the life of Saint Pierre. It is known as the Vitrail des saints Anges or the Lib√©ration de Saint Paul. On a pillar to the right of the altar is the statue and the relics of Santig Du, otherwise known as Jean Discalc√©at.

The work shows Jesus' body being prepared for burial and those depicted, apart from Jesus, are Joseph of Aramathea, John the Evangelist, Mary the mother of Jesus, Mary Magdaene, Marie Salom√©, Mary the mother of John and Nicodemus. =The main altar= It was Monseigneur Ren√© Nicolas Sergent who pressed for an altar to match the grandeur of the cathedral and Mon.Boeswilwad , the architect- in- chief of \\"Monuments Historiques\\" was put in charge of the project. He commissioned the goldsmith Placide Poussielgue-Rusand to create the altar. Poussielgue-Rusand also worked on the altars in the Sacrƒó-Coeur, Sainte Anne and Saint Pierre chapels as well as the elaborate reliquary said to contain the arm of Saint Corentin. Poussielgue-Rusand's altar was in fact exhibited at the 1867 Exposition Universelle and was gifted to the town of Quimper by Napoleon III. The altar is consequently known as the L'autel d'Or or the autel Napolƒóon. This main altar was consecrated by Monseigneur Ren√© Nicolas Sergent in 1868. The stalls The original stalls were made during the 15th century by the carpenters Pierre Le Gluydic, Hervƒó Calvez and the sculptor Jean Kerjagu and installed in the choir area. These stalls were ransacked and knocked about during the French revolution and then replaced in the 19th century by plainer stalls with little decoration.

The nearby Breton Museum has also placed some pieces of sculpture in the space between the museum and the cloisters. One of these sculptures is a \\"statue gƒóminƒóe\\" featuring John the Evangelist and Saint Peter taken from a calvary which had stood at Coat-Quƒóau in Scrignac. It is carved from granite and dates to the 16th-century. Sculptors employed on calvaries at that time used the technique of the \\"statue gƒóminƒóe\\" when carving pieces for the crosspieces of crosses and would carve two back to back figures from one piece of stone. The figures from Scrignac show how the two figures are in fact carved from the one piece.

Civil rights law As a lawyer, Ackman has successfully represented taxi drivers in claims against the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). These victories include: * An order opening the TLC courts to the public, * A ruling in the case of Padberg v. McGrath-McKechnie that TLC courts systemically deprived taxi drivers of their constitutional rights to due process, by suspending their licenses based solely on allegations that they had refused to pick up passengers based on the passengers' race * An order requiring Mayor Giuliani to testify in the Padberg v. McGrath-McKechnie case. Ackman recalled the deposition in an article he wrote for Slate in 2008. * A $7 million judgment for victims of the Mayor Giuliani's and the TLC's Operation Refusal policy. * A summary judgment order holding that the TLC violated the Fourth Amendment and Due Process rights of motorists by seizing their vehicles without a warrant or any valid exception to the warrant requirement. On March 25, 2011, in Nnebe v. Daus, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated in large part a district court ruling that permitted the TLC to suspend a taxi driver based solely on an arrest (including misdemeanor arrests) and continue that suspension without a meaningful hearing, and without any evidence or suspicion that the driver had ever harmed a passenger. (New York Law Journal, March 28, 2011). (Writing for Forbes about the earlier district court ruling, University of Chicago Law Professor Richard Epstein attacked that ruling, saying the court ignored the \\"obvious need for an expanded initial hearing that lets the driver give his version of the facts and, if need be, to post a bond to continue to earn his livelihood.\\" Professor Epstein noted as well that 90% of the cabbies who were arrested and suspended over the years were ultimately exonerated.) Another case, Rothenberg v. Daus, contests TLC's practice of revoking taxicab drivers' licenses who are convicted of a crime, including non-violent misdemeanors and even traffic infractions, almost always occurring when the cab driver was off duty. The TLC had succeeded in winning a motion to dismiss, but the Second Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the district court order and reinstated] all of the cabdrivers' claims. Ackman is challenging the legitimacy of the city's administrative law tribunals in two lawsuits pending in the New York federal courts and has led the successful effort to discredit the TLC's charges that a majority of the city's taxi drivers have overcharged passengers.

Bell, the role has been portrayed by Beth Maitland since 1982. Traci is the daughter of John Abbott and Dina Mergeron. Initially a short-term role that would last three months, Maitland impressed the series' producers and was placed on contract, remaining until 1996. Traci was known for her relationship with Danny Romalotti and her marriages to Brad Carlton, with whom she had a daughter, Colleen. Both relationships caused a notable rivalry with Lauren Fenmore. Since 2006, Maitland has remained on a recurring status with the soap opera. Described as a fan favorite by Soaps in Depth, Maitland's portrayal has garnered praise, including a Daytime Emmy Award in 1985. Casting  Maitland won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her role as Traci in 1985. Originally intended to be a short-term contract role lasting three months, Maitland impressed the producers. She stayed with the show on from June 17, 1982 to June 1987, and from November 1987 to December 1989, September 1990 to June 1993, making guest appearances in December 1993, February to August 1994, February to April 1995, and April to May 1996. She reappeared briefly between 1999, and 2001 through 2002, and since 2006 on a recurring basis. On March 20, 2007, Traci made an appearance on the show's sister soap opera, The Bold and the Beautiful. In 2009, Maitland recorded a song that served as the background music for Traci's daughter, Colleen Carlton's funeral. The song was entitled \\"An Angel's Lullaby.\\" Since Maria Arena Bell became a writer for the show, Traci was seen more often: \\"It got to the point where the show stopped calling altogether and I thought my soap ship had sailed. But, after Maria took over, I suddenly had 30 episodes when [Traci's daughter] Colleen died ‚Äì the biggest storyline I'd had in over 10 years. I don't have those problems anymore. I feel like an honored member of the cast. The climate has changed.\\"http://www.tvguide.com/News/Young- Restless-Beth-Maitland-1032915.aspx  Character development  Since the death of John Abbott, Traci has become the family rock. Although she is the second youngest Abbott sibling, Maitland says, \\"Traci has kind of moved into his spot to make everyone accountable in the Abbott universe. She's the conscience everyone has to 'fess up to.\\" When her niece, Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan), began acting out, Tracy acted as a mediator between her siblings and her niece. Maitland said, \\"Traci sees all of Abby's nightmarish behavior, the drinking, the manipulative pranks, the naked-heiress stuff, as what it really is ‚Äì a cry for help.\\" Storylines =1980s= Like many of Genoa City's privileged youth, Traci Abbott attended boarding school until her return home in 1982. She had low self-esteem because she was overweight, and her older sister, Ashley Abbott, was more glamorous and successful than she was. Traci became the president of rocker Danny Romalotti's (Michael Damian) fan club, and she decided to attend college locally at Genoa City University to be near him. She became a singer in Danny's band, and she fought for his attention with Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). In addition, Traci's mother, Dina, returned to town for the first time since she left Traci as an infant. The stress caused Traci to become conscious of her weight, and Lauren exploited her to get Danny's attention. Traci became addicted to diet pills while in college, and she would often sing (to the melody of \\"Turn to Stone\\" by the Electric Light Orchestra), \\"I turn to pills, when I'm feeling ill, I turn to pills\\". Her addiction culminated when she found out that Danny and Lauren were engaged. She got high, crashed her car and sustained serious heart damage. After her recovery, she went onstage at one of Danny's concerts to speak about the dangers of drug addiction. Then, Traci began seeing her college professor, Tim Sullivan. When she found him in bed with another student, she became suicidal. She tried to kill herself, but Christine \\"Cricket\\" Blair (Lauralee Bell) saved her. Traci then found out that she was pregnant with Tim's child, and Danny Romalotti wanted to marry her to give the baby a family. They married in 1984, but Danny's former flame, Patty Williams (then played by Andrea Evans), was angry because Traci stole Danny. She pushed Traci down a flight of stairs, causing her to miscarry. Traci decided to annul her marriage to Danny, and Patty left town shortly after. Traci then got involved with groundskeeper Brad Carlton (Don Diamont). The two were quickly married in 1986, but Brad chose his budding career over his wife. Traci left town to continue her education at Stanford University. During their separation, Brad had an affair with Lauren Fenmore, and Traci reconnected with Tim Sullivan. Still, Brad ended his romance with Lauren when Traci came home. To keep her in Genoa City, he agreed to have a baby with her. When Traci found out she was pregnant again, Brad's insane ex-wife, Lisa Mansfield, kidnapped Brad, and she tried to make Traci believe that Brad didn't love her anymore. Lisa's scheme caused Traci to have a second miscarriage. When Brad was freed, he worked to win Traci's heart, but instead, Ashley Abbott worked her magic, and she stole Brad from her younger sister. Thus, Traci and Brad divorced in 1989. She went on to write two best-selling books, Echoes of the Past and Epitaph for a Lover. The former novel was based on her life of living in Ashley's shadow. =1990s= Ashley eventually left Brad for Victor Newman (Eric Braeden). Brad spontaneously married Cassandra Rawlins, and he inherited her fortune when she died in a car accident. He then returned to Traci, and they were remarried in 1991. Traci was pregnant again soon after, and she kept the secret from everyone except her father because she wanted Brad to love her without obligations to their child. Soon, Brad grew close to Ashley again when her marriage to Victor fell apart. Still, Traci finally told Brad about their child, he refused to let her raise their child alone. Traci gave birth to Colleen Carlton in 1992. Colleen's birth did not help Brad and Traci's failing marriage, and they divorced later that year. Traci's publisher, Steve Connelly, moved to Genoa City, and the two soon began a romance. Brad became jealous, but he realized that Traci was truly happy. Then, Traci moved to New York City with Colleen, where she married Steve in 1993. In 1994, Traci visited Brad at the hospital when he had a heart attack. Before leaving town, she got into a heated argument with Lauren Fenmore, whom she blamed for Brad's heart attack. In 1996, Traci returned to Genoa City when her father considered remarrying her mother, Dina Mergeron. In 1999, When the Abbotts reclaimed Jabot from Newman Enterprises, Traci returned home to join in the family celebration. = 2000s= In 2001, Traci came home after she learned that Steve cheated on her. At first, Colleen did not believe her mother, but she turned on Steve when she learned the truth. Traci became close to Brad during her stay at home, but he was married to Ashley at the time. Traci decided to forgive Steve and work on their marriage, but Colleen became disgusted with her mother's \\"almost-reunion\\" with Brad. She rebelled against Traci and Steve until she was expelled from school for smoking marijuana. Then, Traci decided to send Colleen to Genoa City to live with her grandfather John Abbott. In 2006, John Abbott had a stroke, and Traci rushed to his bedside. John died soon after from complications from the stroke, and Traci truly began to see the hardships that her family faced while she was away. John's widow, Gloria Abbott (Judith Chapman), was hated by all of John's children. Traci was shocked to learn of the animosity that spread through her family, and she was also unaware of her siblings vendetta with their stepmother. In 2007, Colleen was trapped in a burning building that was set on fire by Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart). Traci rushed to support her daughter, and she also reconnected with her sister, Ashley. Traci returned later that year when Jack dealt with the fallout from a fraud scandal. The next year, Traci was present at the Jabot Cosmetics annual stockholders meeting. She offered her support to Brad in his bid for CEO of the company, but Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard) was appointed CEO in a turn of events. Several months later, Traci came home to attend the \\"funeral\\" of Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper). In reality, Katherine's doppelganger, Marge Cotrooke, had died. At the funeral, Traci ran into her mother, Dina, and the two argued about Dina's lacking role in Colleen's life. In addition, Lauren Fenmore apologized for the way she had treated Traci those many years ago. Traci went back to New York, but she returned again at Christmas to visit Colleen. She also shared a touching moment with Brad, and he called her \\"the one who got away.\\" Several days later, Brad tragically drown after he saved Noah Newman from a frozen pond. Traci stayed in town to attend Brad's funeral, and then she returned to New York. Colleen was kidnapped by Patty Williams. Upon escaping, she fell into a lake, and she almost drowned. She was rushed to the hospital, only to be declared braindead. Patty shot Victor Newman when he attempted to help save Colleen from the lake, and Colleen's heart was donated to him at Traci's request. Traci's brother, Billy Abbott, organized a celebration of Colleen's life that all of her friends and family attended. All of the mourners present released red balloons to honor Colleen while Beth Maitland's song, \\"An Angel's Lullaby,\\" played in the background. Traci and Steve stayed in town long enough to be present for the christening of Ashley's \\"daughter\\", Faith Colleen Abbott. Faith became Traci's goddaughter, and she wore Colleen's christening gown for the ceremony. Adam Newman (Michael Muhney) became Faith's godfather, but in a turn of events, he schemed to make Ashley believe that Faith was her child. In reality, Nick (Joshua Morrow) and Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) were Faith's biological parents. Adam stole Faith from Sharon at birth, and he passed the baby off as Ashley's baby. In reality, Ashley had a hysterical pregnancy, and she never actually gave birth. This dark point in Ashley's life occurred after Traci and Steve went back to New York City. Traci also returned to visit her family for Christmastime. In 2010, Colleen's best friend, Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), had recently overcome a battle with ovarian cancer. Lily could not bear children, but she and her husband, Cane Ashby, were able to conceive through a surrogate mother, Mackenzie Browning (Clementine Ford). When Lily and Cane's twins were born, Lily asked Traci to be their godmother in honor of Colleen, and Traci happily accepted. In 2011, Cane was shot to death on the steps of a church, and Traci attended his \\"funeral.\\" In reality, Cane's twin brother, Caleb Atkinson, was killed on the church steps. Lily believed that she was having hallucinations because she was seeing Cane's \\"ghost.\\" Traci was the only person to sympathize with Lily when everyone else thought that she was insane. Traci's older brother, Jack Abbott, was preparing to marry Genevieve Atkinson (Genie Francis). Traci returned to Genoa City to spend time with Genevieve and her sister, Ashley, before the ceremony. On the day of the wedding, Patty Williams took Genevieve's wedding dress, and she crashed the wedding. She shot Jack when he realized who she was, and Jack refused to marry Genevieve because she bought his prized company, Beauty of Nature. Traci stayed by Jack's beside in the hospital while the doctors told him that he may not be able to walk again. Traci returned in August for Jack's wedding to Nikki, and invited her sister Ashley to come home with her. Traci also returned to support Abby when Victor Newman supposedly died. Victor had been suffering amnesia and was involved in an explosion. As a result of Victor's \\"death\\", Jack was forced to sell Beauty of Nature, and Traci urged Jack to be careful in his business deals. Traci would return shortly thereafter as she moved back to the Abbott Mansion, and became a thorn in Jack's latest relationship with Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford), who recently moved in with Jack. Eventually, Traci gave her blessing, but an accident left Phyllis in a coma and she left for Georgia for experimental treatments. Traci briefly hinted to Jack that her return to Genoa City was sparked by issues with her marriage to Steve following Colleen's death. In 2019, Traci writes another book based on Cane Ashby References Category:The Young and the Restless characters Category:The Bold and the Beautiful characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1982 Category:Fictional writers Category:Female characters in television ","title":"Traci Abbott"},{"id":"6662387","text":"The Eleanor Gerson School is a coeducational alternative day school for students in grades 6 through 12.

The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Smyth's side face St Joseph's of Marino. A 7‚Äì10 to 2‚Äì3 trouncing gave Smyth his first All-Ireland medal. St Flannan's retained their Harty Cup crown in 1946 following another defeat of the North Mon. O'Connell School from Dublin were the opponents in the All-Ireland final and a close game developed. A 5‚Äì7 to 5‚Äì2 score line gave Smyth his second All-Ireland medal. Smyth collected a third consecutive Harty Cup medal following a defeat of St. Colman's College in 1947. Once again St Flannan's reached the All-Ireland decider where St Joseph's of Roscrea provided the opposition. A 6‚Äì8 to 3‚Äì1 victory gave Smyth a third consecutive All-Ireland medal. At St Flannan's Smyth also won three inter-provincial colleges medals with the Munster selection. =Club= Smyth played his club hurling with Ruan and enjoyed much success. In 1948 Smyth represented Ruan in the minor, junior, intermediate and senior grades. It was a successful year as Ruan defeated Clarecastle in the county decider, giving Smyth his first championship medal. He also collected an intermediate championship medal that same year. Having secured their very first championship title, Ruan captured a second three years later in 1951. After a period in the doldrums Smyth's side reached the championship decider once again in 1959. A defeat of √âire √ìg gave Smyth his third championship medal. A defeat of Scariff in the final of 1960 gave Ruan a famous two-in-a-row. It was Smyth's fourth championship medal. Three-in-a-row proved beyond Ruan, however, the team reached the final once again in 1962. Sixmilebridge fell on that occasion, giving Smyth a fifth and final championship medal. =Inter- county= Smyth first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Clare minor hurling team. He made his debut as a fourteen-year-old in 1945 and subsequently set up what must be an all-time record for Clare by playing at this grade for five years in-a-row. In his debut year Clare reached the Munster decider. An 8‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì2 trouncing by Tipperary was Clare's lot on that occasion. As a seventeen-year-old Smyth made his senior debut in a National Hurling League game against Galway in 1948. He played no part in the subsequent 1949 championship due to his involvement as captain with the Clare junior hurling team. He won a Munster medal in that grade following a 3‚Äì3 to 0‚Äì6 defeat of Cork. Clare later defeated Kilkenny before facing London in the All-Ireland decider. A close game developed and, at the full-time whistle, Clare were narrowly defeated by 3‚Äì7 to 3‚Äì6. Smyth made his senior championship debut in a Munster semi-final defeat by Tipperary in 1950. Within just a few seasons he became known as one of the most prolific scorers in the championship. His 6‚Äì4 against Limerick in the Munster quarter-final in 1953 is a record which still stands. In 1954 Clare qualified for the final of the post-season Oireachtas Tournament. All-Ireland runners-up Wexford provided the opposition on that occasion, however, the game ended in a 2‚Äì8 apiece draw. The replay was also a close affair with Clare eventually triumphing by 3‚Äì6 to 0‚Äì12. It was Smyth's first silverware with the Clare senior hurling team. The following year Smyth's side dominated the provincial championship. Defeats of Cork and Tipperary led to Clare being installed as the favourites to take the Munster crown for the first time since 1932. Limerick provided the opposition and went on to defeat an optimistic Clare side by 2‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì6. Smyth added a Thomond Feis medal to his collection in 1956 as Clare won the pre-season warm- up tournament. In late 1964 Smyth dropped out of the Clare team. This was surprising as he was just as prolific as ever, scoring 16‚Äì27 for Clare in seven outings in 1963. His retirement from the inter-county scene at this stage was premature but he returned to play for the Clare intermediate team in 1966 before making a return to the Clare senior team in 1967. That year he lined out in his second ever Munster decider. A 4‚Äì12 to 2‚Äì6 defeat by Tipperary brought the curtain down on Smyth's inter-county career. =Inter- provincial= Smyth also had the honour of lining out with Munster in the inter-provincial series of games. He first lined out for the team in 1952 and was an unused substitute as Munster claimed the Railway Cup that year. By 1955 Smyth had made his way onto the starting fifteen. He won his first Railway Cup medal on the field of play that year as Munster defeated Connacht by 6‚Äì8 to 3‚Äì4. After surrendering their title in 1956, Munster bounced back the following year with Smyth lining out in the forwards. A 5‚Äì7 to 2‚Äì5 defeat of Leinster gave him his second Railway Cup medal. It was the first of five successive Railway Cup titles for Munster with Smyth playing a prominent role in all of those successes. Six-in-a-row proved beyond Munster, however, the province reached the Railway Cup decider again in 1963. A narrow 2‚Äì8 to 2‚Äì7 defeat of Leinster in a replay gave Smyth his seventh Railway Cup medal on the field of play and an eight over all. It was also his last appearance for Munster. Personal life Born in Ruan, County Clare, Smyth received his first schooling at Kells National School, where his mother was a teacher and hurling enthusiast. His uncle had lined out as a hurler for Clare. Smyth later received his secondary schooling at St Flannan's College in Ennis. In 1959 Smyth married Veronica Gleeson from Coore, Mullagh, and they came to live in Ennis. They had four children Ann Patrica Brighid and Peter. In 1964 Smyth was appointed to an executive position in Croke Park and he and his family moved to Dublin. Following his retirement in 1988 Smyth studied philosophy at Trinity College, Dublin, where he completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1993. His Master of Arts thesis was based on the songs, poems and recitations of Gaelic games in Munster. Jimmy Smyth died on 9 February 2013.

When he was eighteen, his father was murdered during a robbery, creating an emotional crisis that challenged his religious beliefs. From 1825 to 1826, he lived in Rome, where he became friends with fellow painter Ludwig Richter. It was at this time that he began to suffer from progressive colorblindness. In 1827, he married Julie Krummacher (1804-1909), daughter of Friedrich Adolf Krummacher, the evangelical theologian.Genealogisches Handbuch der baltischen Ritterschaften, Teil 2,1,: Estland, Bd.:1, G√∂rlitz, 1930, s.627 They had six children.

From 1853 to 1863, he served as personal chamberlain to Duke Alexander Karl, who was suffering from a severe mental illness. During these years, he increasingly turned from painting to writing. In 1870, his memoirs were published by Philipp von Nathusius. They were given the title Jugenderinnerungen eines alten Mannes (Childhood Memories of an Old Man). These stories from his youth quickly became popular reading for the German middle-class. Their 230th edition appeared in 1922.

It is taken by mouth. CTA is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It is a high-efficacy partial estrogen and shows some properties of a selective estrogen receptor modulator, with predominantly estrogenic activity but also some antiestrogenic activity. CTA itself is inactive and is a prodrug in the body. CTA was introduced for medical use in 1952. It has been marketed in the United States and Europe. However, it has since been discontinued and is no longer available in any country. Medical uses CTA has been used in the treatment of menopausal symptoms and estrogen deficiency in women and prostate cancer in men, among other indications. It has been used to suppress lactation in women. Side effects In men, CTA can produce gynecomastia as a side effect. Conversely, it does not appear to lower testosterone levels in men, and hence does not seem to have a risk of hypogonadism and associated side effects in men. Pharmacology Testosterone levels with no treatment and with various estrogens in men with prostate cancer. Determinations were made with an early radioimmunoassay (RIA). Source was Shearer et al. (1973). CTA is a relatively weak estrogen, with about one-eighth the potency of DES. However, it is highly lipophilic and is stored in fat tissue for prolonged periods of time, with its slow release from fat resulting in a very long duration of action. CTA itself is inactive; it behaves as a prodrug to desmethylchlorotrianisene (DMCTA), a weak estrogen that is formed as a metabolite via mono-O-demethylation of CTA in the liver. As such, the potency of CTA is reduced if it is given parenterally instead of orally. Although it is referred to as a weak estrogen and was used solely as an estrogen in clinical practice, CTA is a high-efficacy partial agonist of the estrogen receptor. As such, it is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), with predominantly estrogenic effects but also with antiestrogenic effects, and was arguably the first SERM to ever be introduced. CTA can antagonize estradiol at the level of the hypothalamus, resulting in disinhibition of the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìgonadal axis and an increase in estrogen levels. Clomifene and tamoxifen were both derived from CTA via structural modification, and are much lower-efficacy partial agonists than CTA and hence much more antiestrogenic in comparison. As an example, chlorotrianisene produces gynecomastia in men, albeit reportedly to a lesser extent than other estrogens, while clomifene and tamoxifen do not and can be used to treat gynecomastia. CTA at a dosage of 48 mg/day inhibits ovulation in almost all women. Conversely, it has been reported that CTA has no measurable effect on circulating levels of testosterone in men. This is in contrast to other estrogens, like diethylstilbestrol, which can suppress testosterone levels by as much as 96%‚Äîor to an equivalent extent as castration. These findings suggest that CTA is not an effective antigonadotropin in men. Chemistry Chlorotrianisene, also known as tri-p-anisylchloroethylene (TACE) or as tris(p-methoxyphenyl)chloroethylene, is a synthetic nonsteroidal compound of the triphenylethylene group. It is structurally related to the nonsteroidal estrogen diethylstilbestrol and to the SERMs clomifene and tamoxifen. History CTA was introduced for medical use in the United States in 1952, and was subsequently introduced for use throughout Europe. It was the first estrogenic compound of the triphenylethylene series to be introduced. CTA was derived from estrobin (DBE), a derivative of the very weakly estrogenic compound triphenylethylene (TPE), which in turn was derived from structural modification of diethylstilbestrol (DES). The SERMs clomifene and tamoxifen, as well as the antiestrogen ethamoxytriphetol, were derived from CTA via structural modification. Society and culture =Generic names= Chlorotrianisene is the generic name of the drug and its , , and .

Born in Knockaderry near Ballyduff, County Waterford, Cheasty first arrived on the inter-county scene as a dual player in the minor grade with Waterford. He made his senior debut in the 1954‚Äì55 National Hurling League. Cheasty went on to play a key part for Waterford in what has come to be known as a defining era for the county, and won one All-Ireland medal and three Munster medals. Cheasty represented the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions throughout his career, winning three Railway Cup medals in 1958, 1960 and 1961. At club level he won five championship medals with Portlaw. Cited by many of his hurling peers as one of Waterford's greatest-ever players, Cheasty was described by Jim Irish as \\"the greatest centre-forward I ever played with or saw in Waterford.\\" Cheasty retired from inter-county hurling after breaking his finger during a 1967 championship clash with Cork. Playing career =Club= Cheasty started his club hurling with his local Ballyduff Lower GAA club winning a Junior Hurling County medal in 1961. The club merged with neighbours Portlaw GAA in the late 1960s. He won one county titles with Ballyduff Lower/Portlaw in 1970. Ballyduff and Portlaw went their separate ways in 1971 and Cheasty elected to play with Portlaw, winning four more County Championships, the last in 1977 at the age of 43. He would later win a Junior Hurling County medals with his native club Ballyduff Lower in 1983, a few months shy of his 50th birthday. =Inter-county= After an unsuccessful dual minor career, Cheasty's senior hurling career had something of an unorthodox beginning. While attending a National League game between Waterford and Kilkenny at Walsh Park as a spectator, the former team were so short of players that the selectors resorted to searching the crowd for hurlers. Cheasty volunteered his services on that occasion, and within two years he had become a regular member of Waterford's championship fifteen. In 1957 Waterford made a long-awaited breakthrough in the championship. A 1‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì6 defeat of reigning provincial champions Cork gave Cheasty his first Munster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland decider saw Kilkenny provide the opposition. Waterford had a one-point lead at the interval and looked destined to claim their second All-Ireland crown when they stretched their lead to six points in the second- half. A Kilkenny revival put an end to Waterford's hopes, with Cheasty's side facing a narrow 4‚Äì10 to 3‚Äì12 defeat. After surrendering their provincial title the following year, Waterford bounced back in 1959. A 3‚Äì9 to 2‚Äì9 defeat of Cork gave Cheasty a second Munster medal. Once again Waterford subsequently lined out in the championship decider, with Kilkenny providing the opposition once again. The game was another exciting affair and with ninety seconds left in the game Kilkenny were ahead by three points. Just then S√©amus Power scored the equalising goal to force a remarkable 1‚Äì17 to 5‚Äì5 draw. The replay was another great game with both sides giving it their all. Waterford scored three goals in the opening thirty minutes, with Cheasty finding the net twice, to help his side to a 3‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì10 win. The victory gave him an All-Ireland medal. Cheasty added an Oireachtas medal to his collection in 1962 following a 4‚Äì12 to 3‚Äì9 defeat of Tipperary. In 1963 Cheasty found himself in a most unusual situation when, after starring for Waterford in the National League 'home' final against Tipperary, he missed the final 'proper' against New York after being suspended for violating the GAA's controversial 'ban' having attended a dance run by a local soccer club. He returned to inter-county activity for the championship, and won a third Munster medal following an 0‚Äì11 to 0‚Äì8 victory over three-in-a-row hopefuls Tipperary. For the third successive time Kilkenny turned out to be Waterford's opponents in the subsequent All-Ireland final. Things weren't going well for Cheasty's side and at one stage Waterford were eleven points in arrears. The men from the D√©ise clawed back this deficit to two points but an expert display of free-taking by Eddie Keher proved the difference as Kilkenny won by 4‚Äì17 to 6‚Äì8. Cheasty retired from inter-county hurling in 1967 after breaking his finger in a provincial defeat of All-Ireland champions Cork. =Inter-provincial= Cheasty also had the honour of lining out for Munster in the inter-provincial series of games. In 1958 he was first called into action with the province, and subsequently won a Railway Cup medal following a 3‚Äì7 to 3‚Äì5 defeat of Leinster. After a one-year absence, Cheasty was back on the Munster team in 1960 and 1961. Back-to-back defeats of Leinster brought his Railway Cup medal tally to three. Personal life Born in Ballyduff, Kilmeaden, County Waterford, his father, Geoffrey, was a native of the parish. His mother, Kathleen Walsh, was from Mooncoin in South Kilkenny and, at the age of four, he went to live with his maternal aunt and uncle in Kilkenny for a short period. On his return to Ballyduff he finished his schooling and began work on the family farm. His inter-county hurling career over, Cheasty married local Ballyduff girl Kathleen Kelly and settled down, having purchased a farm in Killure near Waterford Airport. Together the couple had three daughters, Siobh√°n, Margaret and Catherine, and one son, Geoffrey. Sadly one of their daughters died suddenly as a young woman. In July 2007 Cheasty suffered a fall and then contracted pneumonia. He died at Waterford Regional Hospital on 10 August 2007.

He later transferred and is a 1981 graduate of the University of Arizona with a degree in biology. He continued his education at Butler, where he earned a Master of Science degree in 1994. Coaching career John's first coaching position was as a basketball coach at his alma mater, Salpointe Catholic High School in Tucson, Arizona. At Salpointe, John served as the freshman head coach and a varsity assistant for three seasons from 1980‚Äì83. He also taught physical science and biology there. John's next job was at Jamestown Community College in New York, as an assistant from 1983‚Äì85. He left Jamestown in 1985 to become an assistant coach with the University of Oregon, serving under head coach Don Monson. After one season with the Ducks, John returned to Jamestown to become the head coach for the 1986‚Äì87 and 1987‚Äì88 seasons. He led JCC to a two-year mark of 41‚Äì19 and to the Region 3 West Zone title game his first year. John was named the conference's Coach of the Year. After two seasons as the head coach at Jamestown, John left to become an assistant coach at the University of San Francisco. He remained in San Francisco for one season. John moved on again to become an assistant to Barry Collier at Butler University. He was a member of the Bulldogs‚Äô staff from 1989‚Äì97, and helped the team to a then- school record 23 wins his final year. The 1997 team advanced to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 35 years. In 1997, John again became an assistant coach at the University of Oregon. He remained with the Ducks for one season. The following season, John was hired as an assistant at the University of Arizona, under legendary coach Lute Olson (a 2002 Naismith Hall of Fame inductee). In four seasons at Arizona, John helped the Wildcats to four NCAA Tournament appearances, including the national championship game in 2001. While in Tucson, Arizona finished in the top 12 in the national rankings every season, six student-athletes were selected in the NBA Draft, and on nine occasions individuals were selected to the All-Pac-10 team. John has been credited with the development of the Wildcats‚Äô power forwards and centers during his tenure. Lindy's College Basketball Yearbook named him one of five assistant coaches to watch, and Hoop Scoop ranked him number one in its top 25 assistant coaches poll. In April 2002, John was introduced as the 19th head basketball coach in Oregon State's storied history. In his first season at Oregon State, John's team earned its most conference victories in eight seasons, going 6‚Äì12 in the Pac-10 (6th-T), Oregon State's highest conference standing in 10 years. His team won at USC and UCLA in the same season for the first time in 15 years and captured the most road victories in one season in a decade. The 2004‚Äì05 season, year 3 for John, was the season that things really got turned around. The team posted their first winning record in 15 seasons, going 8‚Äì10 in the Pac-10 and 17‚Äì15 overall. This was Oregon State's most conference wins and highest place in the conference(5th) since the 1992‚Äì93 season. John's squad won a Pac-10 Tournament game for the first time since 1989, beating UCLA in the first round. The Beavers earned a post-season berth for the first time since 1990, receiving a bid to the National Invitation Tournament. However, the Beavers regressed over the next two seasons, winning a total of eight games in Pac-10 play. After starting 6-12 in 2007-08 (including 0-6 in Pac-10 play), John was relieved of his duties on January 20, 2008. On April 23, 2008, John was announced as a member of Mike Montgomery's staff on the California Golden Bears men's basketball team.

The 14th Century Arab historian Ibn Khaldun described Sufism as: \\"dedication to worship, total dedication to Allah most High, disregard for the finery and ornament of the world, abstinence from the pleasure, wealth, and prestige sought by most men, and retiring from others to worship alone\\". The group claims that up to 80% of Britain's 2 million Muslims come from the Sufi tradition, which is a mystical and personal interpretation of Islam and largely apolitical.. However, the figure has been challenged by the group's critics. Sufi Muslim Council: mission statement The SMC was launched with the backing of the government and other faith groups. Politicians from the Labour party welcomed the establishment of the group. The SMC states that it differs from the plethora of other British Islamic groups in that its approach to Islam is less political and hence less confrontational. It tends to view British Muslims as part of mainstream British society rather than separate from it. The group is widely perceived to act as a counter to the Muslim Council of Britain. However its use of the term \\"Sufi\\" (i.e. Islamic mystic) has raised important questions about its authenticity in the Muslim community. Traditional Sufi Orders in Islam (called \\"tariqahs\\") are defined by their hagiographic genealogy (\\"silsile\\") which they trace back to the Prophet Muhammad and this is considered the criterion of their authenticity in the eyes of the community. The absence of any silsile (or even reference to it) anywhere in the SMC's literature has led to serious doubts over its true mystical pedigree and has increased suspicions over its political agenda. Furthermore, in the science and tradition of Tasawwuf, or Sufism, any self-reference as an individual or group as a 'Sufi' is considered presumptious and arrogant. Isolating Sufism as a sect of Muslims rather than a tradition of self growth and spiritual refinement is also alien to Tasawwuf. The Sufi Muslim Council and Islamic extremism The SMC has taken a strong stand against radical Islamic extremism prevalent amongst some Muslim youth in the UK, as illustrated by the 7/7 terrorist attacks carried out by predominantly by young Muslims of British Pakistani descent. In its website the group states: \\"While every religion rejects acts of tyranny, injustice and oppression, extremism is found in every religion. As Muslims we are supporters of love, peace, justice, respect and tolerance. Thus, we see it as our duty to continue to shed light on current events while doing our best to see that the wave of militant radicalism sweeping Muslim nations does not strike again in UK, where we live.\\" Rivalry between the Sufi Muslim Council and the Muslim Council of Britain Given their different approaches to expressing the religion of Islam, both the SMC and the MCB have criticised each other regarding the extent to which unelected community organisations can fight Islamic extremism and alienation from the mainstream. The MCB has dismissed the SMC as 'unrepresentative and divisive'. Meanwhile the SMC has accused existing organisations for not doing enough to engage with and tackle radicalism within British Muslim communities.

Montgomery was born in Ayrshire at Broadstone Castle, near Beith. He was the son of Adam Montgomery, the 5th Laird of Braidstane, by his wife and cousin Margaret Hessilhead.  Early career  After being educated at University of Glasgow and time spent at the royal court of France, Montgomery served as a captain of foot of a Scottish Regiment under William I of Orange during the early parts of the Eighty Years' War. He returned to Scotland upon the death of his parents in 1587. He inherited his father's title as the Laird of Braidstane and married Elizabeth Shaw, who died in 1625. Montgomery established a relationship with King James VI. He was able to gain some influence in the king's court due to his correspondence with his brother George Montgomery, who had been named Dean of Norwich in 1602. The information contained in the correspondence was important to James as it included details on English politics.  Montgomery‚ÄìCunningham feud  Montgomery became involved in the centuries-old feud between Clan Montgomery and Clan Cunningham. The feud dates to the 15th century when a Montgomery was named Bailie of Cunninghame by James II, a post the Cunninghams claimed was rightfully theirs. The 4th Earl of Eglinton was assassinated by the Cunninghams at about the time of Montgomery's return to Scotland. Montgomery's involvement in the feud began when he took offence at something that a Cunningham said. Cunningham fled to London, then to Holland, where Montgomery caught up with him and confronted him in the Inner Court of the Palace at The Hague. Combating Cunningham with a sword, Montgomery delivered what he believing to be a killing thrust, but Cunningham's belt buckle deflected the blow. Montgomery believed he had killed Cunningham and made to leave the palace. He was arrested and imprisoned at Gevangenpoort in the Binnenhof. Montgomery broke out of jail with the help of a Scottish soldier. Montgomery received a reprimand from King James but was soon back in favour. He accompanied the king to his coronation as King of England in spring 1603 after the death of Queen Elizabeth.  Ulster Settlement  Montgomery's friendship with the king was useful to him next in establishing a Settlement in Ireland in 1606 (preceding the Plantation of Ulster in 1610). Looking for opportunity for advancement, Montgomery came into contact with the wife of Con O'Neill, a landowner in Ulster, who was imprisoned at Carrickfergus Castle for instigating rebellion against the Queen. Montgomery and Ellis O'Neill (the wife) made a deal that the O'Neills would give half of their land to him if he could free Con and secure for him a royal pardon. Montgomery sent a relative to Ireland to lead the jailbreak, which was successful. At this point, James Hamilton interfered with the negotiations with the King, securing for himself a share of the land in question with the resultant shares being one-third each for Hamilton, Montgomery and O'Neill, who gained pardon. (Montgomery also secured for his brother George, his staunchest political ally, title as Bishop of Derry and Raphoe.) Montgomery and Hamilton recruited Scots of many families and trades to populate their settlement. In May 1606 the first wave of settlers arrived. Montgomery settled at Newtownards and soon established a trade route between Donaghadee in Ireland and Portpatrick in Scotland. In 1613, Montgomery, along with Hamilton, represented the settlement to the Irish House of Commons. At Donaghadee he built a large stone quay to accommodate vessels ferrying between Scotland and Ireland from 1616 onwards. On 3 May 1622, Montgomery was made Viscount Montgomery. Montgomery may have been given a Scottish State funeral in Newtownards on 8 September 1636. Montgomery‚Äôs coat of arms (a fleur de lis and hand above a crescent) survives today as part of the crest of Ards Borough Council, and in the school badge for Regent House Grammar School, Newtownards. Marriage and children His sons included: *Hugh Montgomery, 2nd Viscount Montgomery (d. 15 November 1642) of the Great Ards, eldest son and heir, who in 1623 married Lady Jean Alexander (d.1670), daughter of the 1st Earl of Stirling, by whom he had a son: **Hugh Montgomery, 1st Earl of Mount Alexander, an ancestor of the actress Flora Montgomery. *Sir James Montgomery (born 1600) of Rosemount, County Down, Ireland, second son, a noted military commander. In 1649 he fled from Ireland on the approach of Oliver Cromwell and returned to Scotland, then went into exile in Holland.The Montgomery Manuscripts, Belfast, 1830 His daughters included: Isabel who married Robert Cunningham, and Katherine who married Robert Blair.

It has also been used to treat male infertility, although this use is controversial. It is taken by mouth. Side effects of mesterolone include symptoms of masculinization like acne, increased hair growth, voice changes, and increased sexual desire. It has no risk of liver damage. The drug is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It has weak androgenic effects and weak anabolic effects, which make it useful for producing masculinization. The drug has no estrogenic effects. Mesterolone was first described by 1966 and introduced for medical use by 1967. In addition to its medical use, mesterolone has been used to improve physique and performance, although it is not commonly used for such purposes due to its weak anabolic effects. The drug is a controlled substance in many countries and so non-medical use is generally illicit. Medical uses Mesterolone is used in the treatment of androgen deficiency in male hypogonadism, anemia, and to support male fertility among other indications. It has also been used to treat delayed puberty in boys. Because it lacks estrogenic effects, mesterolone may be indicated for treating cases of androgen deficiency in which breast tenderness or gynecomastia is also present. The drug is described as a relatively weak androgen with partial activity and is rarely used for the purpose of androgen replacement therapy, but is still widely used in medicine. Mesterolone is used in androgen replacement therapy at a dosage of 50 to 100 mg 2 to 3 times per day. Non-medical uses Mesterolone has been used for physique- and performance-enhancing purposes by competitive athletes, bodybuilders, and powerlifters. Side effects Side effects of mesterolone include virilization among others. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Like other AAS, mesterolone is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR). It is not a substrate for 5Œ±-reductase, as it is already 5Œ±-reduced, and hence is not potentiated in so-called \\"androgenic\\" tissues such as the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland. Mesterolone is described as a very poor anabolic agent due to inactivation by 3Œ±-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3Œ±-HSD) in skeletal muscle tissue, similarly to DHT and mestanolone (17Œ±-methyl-DHT). In contrast, testosterone is a very poor substrate for 3Œ±-HSD, and so is not similarly inactivated in skeletal muscle. Because of its lack of potentiation by 5Œ±-reductase in \\"androgenic\\" tissues and its inactivation by 3Œ±-HSD in skeletal muscle, mesterolone is relatively low in both its androgenic potency and its anabolic potency. However, it does still show a greater ratio of anabolic activity to androgenic activity relative to testosterone. Mesterolone is not a substrate for aromatase, and so cannot be converted into an estrogen. As such, it has no propensity for producing estrogenic side effects such as gynecomastia and fluid retention. It also has no progestogenic activity. Because mesterolone is not 17Œ±-alkylated, it has little or no potential for hepatotoxicity. However, its risk of deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system is comparable to that of several other oral AAS. =Pharmacokinetics= The C1Œ± methyl group of mesterolone inhibits its hepatic metabolism and thereby confers significant oral activity, although its oral bioavailability is still much lower than that of 17Œ±-alkylated AAS. In any case, mesterolone is one of the few non-17Œ±-alkylated AAS that is active with oral ingestion. Uniquely among AAS, mesterolone has very high affinity for human serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), about 440% that of DHT in one study and 82% of that of DHT in another study. As a result, it may displace endogenous testosterone from SHBG and thereby increase free testosterone concentrations, which may in part be involved in its effects. Chemistry Mesterolone, also known as 1Œ±-methyl-4,5Œ±-dihydrotestosterone (1Œ±-methyl-DHT) or as 1Œ±-methyl-5Œ±-androstan-17Œ≤-ol-3-one, is a synthetic androstane steroid and derivative of DHT. It is specifically DHT with a methyl group at the C1Œ± position. Closely related AAS include metenolone and its esters metenolone acetate and metenolone enanthate. The antiandrogen rosterolone (17Œ±-propylmesterolone) is also closely related to mesterolone. History Mesterolone was developed in the 1960s and was first described by 1966. It was introduced for medical use by Schering under the brand name Proviron by 1967. The well-established brand name Proviron had previously been used by Schering for testosterone propionate starting in 1936. Following the introduction of mesterolone as Proviron, Schering continued to market testosterone propionate under the brand name Testoviron. A number of sources incorrectly state that mesterolone was synthesized or introduced for medical use in 1934.

Research In one small scale clinical trial of depressed patients, an improvement of symptoms which included anxiety, lack of drive and desire was observed. In patients with dysthymia, unipolar, and bipolar depression significant improvement was observed. In this series of studies, mesterolone lead to a significant decrease in luteinizing hormone and testosterone levels. In another study, 100 mg mesterolone cipionate was administered twice monthly. With regards to plasma testosterone levels, there was no difference between the treated versus untreated group, and baseline luteinizing hormone levels were minimally affected.

It is also the name of a district of the city, which contains the neighbourhood and its surroundings. The name (meaning \\"old town\\") comes from the fact that Helsinki was originally founded in the Vanhakaupunki area. The Swedish name Gamla Helsingfors appears in the new Helsinki foundation document from 1639, as the city was moved to its later location, and the forms Gamla staden or Gammelstaden came into use after this. The Finnish translation of the name only started appearing in the late 19th century. The current names were established as official in 1909. The neighbourhood was named Vanhakaupunki in 1959. A weir in Vantaa River and a small hydro-electric power station by Kuninkaankartanonsaari island. History The Swedish king Gustav Vasa founded Helsinki on June 12, 1550 on the mouth of the Vantaa River on the site of the medieval village of Forsby (Finnish: Koskela). The city was to compete with Tallinn for the commerce in the Bay of Finland and to reduce the illegal trading done by peasants. The inhabitants from the city were drawn from the cities of Rauma, Eken√§s, Ulvila, and Porvoo, which were discontinued. In 1570, a fire broke out in Helsinki in the winter, and in summer, the black plague spread into the city. The city has about 500 inhabitants at that point. In the 1640s, Helsinki was moved to its current location on the Vironniemi peninsula because of better harbour conditions, to boost the city commerce. Vanhakaupunki was slowly deserted. Only one map, a small-scale map drawn by Hans Hansson in 1645, remains of the first Helsinki. It depicts the city's location and the layout plan for its later years. The city blocks appear in the map, but the lots aren't marked. The only building drawn on the map is the church, which was located west of the north end of the current Vanhankaupungintie road. Currently Today, Vanhakaupunki is the name of two different organisational subdivisions of Helsinki. It is a neighbourhood, with an area of 0.32 km¬≤ west of the Vanhankaupunginlahti bay. The area has about 230 inhabitants and 850 jobs. Additionally, the Vanhakaupunki district (Vanhankaupungin peruspiiri) is a subdivision of the Helsinki central major district, and includes the Vanhakaupunki neighbourhood as well as the neighbourhoods of Arabianranta, Toukola, Kumpula, K√§pyl√§, and Koskela.

It is taken by mouth. Side effects of fluoxymesterone include symptoms of masculinization like acne, increased hair growth, voice changes, and increased sexual desire.

The drug is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

It is specifically approved in one or more countries for the treatment of hypogonadism in men, delayed puberty in boys, and breast cancer in women.http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800012288 Current prescribing guidelines in the United States list only the treatment of androgen deficiency in males and breast cancer in females as indications. Fluoxymesterone is less effective in inducing masculinization than testosterone, but is useful for maintaining established masculinization in adults. =Available forms= Fluoxymesterone is available in the form of 2, 5, and 10 mg oral tablets. Non-medical uses Fluoxymesterone is used for physique- and performance- enhancing purposes by competitive athletes, bodybuilders, and powerlifters. Side effects Side effects that have been associated with fluoxymesterone include acne, edema, seborrhea/seborrheic dermatitis, alopecia, hirsutism, voice deepening, virilization in general, flushing, gynecomastia, breast pain, menstrual disturbances, hypogonadism, testicular atrophy, clitoral enlargement, penile enlargement, priapism, increased aggressiveness, prostate enlargement, cardiovascular toxicity, and hepatotoxicity, among others. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= As an AAS, fluoxymesterone is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), similarly to androgens like testosterone and DHT. It is a substrate for 5Œ±-reductase like testosterone, and so is potentiated in so-called \\"androgenic\\" tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland via transformation into 5Œ±-dihydrofluoxymesterone. As such, fluoxymesterone has a relatively poor ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity similarly to testosterone and methyltestosterone. However, fluoxymesterone is nonetheless proportionally less androgenic and more anabolic than methyltestosterone and testosterone. Fluoxymesterone has been reported to be non-aromatizable due to steric hindrance by its C11Œ≤ hydroxyl group, and hence is not considered to have a propensity for producing estrogenic effects such as gynecomastia or fluid retention. However, paradoxically, a case report of severe fluoxymesterone- induced gynecomastia exists, and gynecomastia associated with fluoxymesterone has also been reported in other publications, although this may not be due to estrogenic activity. Fluoxymesterone is thought to possess little or no progestogenic activity. Because of the presence of its 17Œ±-methyl group, the metabolism of fluoxymesterone is impeded, resulting in it being orally active, although also hepatotoxic. 11Œ≤-HSD inhibition Fluoxymesterone has been found to act as a potent inhibitor of 11Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11Œ≤-HSD2) ( = 60‚Äì630 nM), with a potency comparable to that of the 11Œ≤-HSD2 inhibitor glycyrrhetinic acid. This action of fluoxymesterone is unique among AAS and is likely related to its 11Œ≤-hydroxyl group. 11Œ≤-HSD2 is responsible for the inactivation of the glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone (into cortisone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone, respectively). Inhibition of 11Œ≤-HSD2 by fluoxymesterone may result in mineralocorticoid receptor overactivation and associated side effects such as hypertension and fluid retention, and has been hypothesized to be involved in the cardiovascular and other adverse effects of fluoxymesterone. Glucocorticoid activity Unlike other AAS, fluoxymesterone has structural features in common with corticosteroids, including its C9Œ± fluoro and C11Œ≤ hydroxyl groups. In relation to this, it has weak (micromolar) but potentially clinically significant affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor. =Pharmacokinetics= Fluoxymesterone has approximately 80% oral bioavailability, unlike testosterone, as the C17Œ± methyl group of fluoxymesterone inhibits first-pass metabolism. It has very low affinity for human serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), less than 5% of that of testosterone and less than 1% of that of DHT. The drug is metabolized in the liver, mainly by 6Œ≤-hydroxylation, 5Œ±- and 5Œ≤-reduction, 3Œ±- and 3Œ≤-keto-oxidation, and 11Œ≤-hydroxy-oxidation. Its known active metabolites include 5Œ±-dihydrofluoxymesterone and 11-oxofluoxymesterone. Fluoxymesterone has an elimination half-life of approximately 9.2 hours, which is long relative to that of testosterone.Seth Roberts (2009). Anabolic Pharmacology. It is eliminated in the urine, with less than 5% excreted unchanged. Chemistry Fluoxymesterone, also known as 9Œ±-fluoro-11Œ≤-hydroxy-17Œ±-methyltestosterone or as 9Œ±-fluoro-17Œ±-methylandrost-4-en-11Œ≤,17Œ≤-diol-3-one, is a synthetic androstane steroid and a 17Œ±-alkylated derivative of testosterone (androst-4-en-17Œ≤-ol-3-one). It is specifically the derivative of testosterone with a fluorine atom at the C9Œ± position, a hydroxyl group at the C11Œ≤ position, and a methyl group at the C17Œ± position. =Synthesis= Step one: The first step in the synthesis of fluoxymesterone is the microbiological oxidation of commercially available androstenedione (1.11) by Actinomyces; this introduces a hydroxyl group to the 11Œ±-position (1.12), which is then oxidised to a ketone using Jones‚Äô reagent, yielding the 3,11,17-triketone, adrenosterone (1.13). Pyrrolidine then reacts to form an enamine (1.14) by reaction with the 3Œ±-keto group, protecting it from alkylation in a subsequent step. The regioselectivity of pyrrolidine for reaction at the 3Œ±-position occurs inherently in the structure of adrenosterone, due to the position of the sterically bulky methyl groups. In subsequent steps, alkylation of the 17-keto group (1.14) using Grignard reagent, addition of hydride at the 11-position (1.15) and regeneration of the protected 3-keto group yields the starting material (1.16) for the final steps of the fluoxymesterone synthesis. This involves more standard synthetic transformations. thumb Step two: The 11Œ±-hydroxyl of the starting material (1.16) is sulfonylated by p-toluenesulfonyl chloride; addition of trimethylamine (base) deprotonates the 11Œ±-carbon, yielding an (E2) elimination of tosylate (pka \\\\- 5) to give olefin (1.17). Stereospecificity of reaction between olefin and hypobromous acid (HOBr) in base, N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), is determined by the formation of a bromonium intermediate; the electrophilic bromonium cation approaches the ring's less sterically hindered Œ±-face and is attacked by the œÄ-electron density of the alkene. The hydroxide ion then attacks from above the ring (Œ≤-face) at the 11-carbon, resulting in a structure (1.18) by the stereospecific addition of hydroxyl and bromine across the double bond. Addition of sodium hydroxide results in deprotonation of the 11Œ±-hydroxyl, and the subsequent structure undergoes an intramolecular SN2 epoxy ring formation. The epoxy ring of the Œ≤-epoxide (1.19) is protonated to give an oxironium ion intermediate. In a concerted process, fluoride attacks the ring's Œ±-face from below, as one of the two oxygen-carbon bonds is broken on the opposite face; hence regenerating the 11Œ±-hydroxyl trans to the fluorine substituent. The resulting structure (1.20) is the androgenic steroid, fluoxymesterone. =Detection in body fluids= Detection of halotestin and other such illegal anabolic steroids in sports is achieved by GS-MS identification of urinary excreted anabolic steroids and their metabolites. In a test for halotestin, a dry residue obtained from a urine sample is dissolved in dimethylformamide and a sulfur trioxide-pyridine complex and is heated with 1% potassium carbonate solution. Halotestin and many of its metabolites contain two polar hydroxyl groups, leading to intermolecular hydrogen bonding that increases their boiling point and reduces volatility. In order to attain a gaseous sample for GC-MS, the products of hydrolysis are extracted, dissolved in methanol and derivatised to form volatile trimethylsilyl (TMS) esters by adding N-methyl-N- trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) and trimethylsilylimidazole (TMSImi). History Fluoxymesterone was first described in 1956 and was introduced for medical use in the United States in 1957.

This was Charteris' fourth full-length novel, and is one of the few full-length books in his canon that does not feature the character of Simon Templar, alias \\"The Saint\\". However, the book does have a connection to the Saint series. The novel was a follow-up to an earlier work entitled X Esquire, which was Charteris' first novel, published in 1927. Daredevil followed the exploits of Christopher \\"Storm\\" Arden, described as \\"the fighting daredevil\\". The character featured many elements that would later be incorporated into The Saint (including the car he drove, a Hirondel, of the type later used by Simon Templar in the early Saint novels and stories). The most notable element of the book is that it featured the first appearance of Scotland Yard Inspector Claud Eustace Teal, the gum-chewing detective who later became a recurring character in the Simon Templar novels, novellas, and short stories starting in 1929 (Templar had been introduced in the 1928 novel, Meet - The Tiger! but this book did not feature Teal; the earliest stories to feature Teal and Templar together can be found in the 1930 collection Enter the Saint). Other than the character, there is no indication of narrative continuity between this novel and the Saint series, and it has never been reprinted alongside the Saint books. Charteris would go on to write one further novel in 1929, The Bandit, before focusing almost exclusively on writing Simon Templar adventures (with a few exceptions) for the remainder of his literary career.

Early life and family Blackwood was born in 1755, the second son of Sir John Blackwood, 2nd Baronet and Dorcas Stevenson, daughter and co-heiress of James Stevenson. His mother was quite wealthy as her father eventually became the sole heir to estates held by James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Clanbrassil, whose male line had died out with his son. In 1799, James' father died, leaving him to inherit the baronetcy as his elder brother, Robert Blackwood, had been killed in 1785 in a fall from his horse. Although commonly referred to as Anglo-Irish, the Blackwoods are a Scottish family. In 1800, his mother was created Baroness Dufferin and Claneboye of Ballyleidy and Killyeagh in the Peerage of Ireland, with remainder to her heirs male. After her death in 1807, he succeeded her as the 2nd Baron Dufferin and Claneboye. Career Blackwood was a Member of the Parliament of Ireland for Killyleagh in County Down from 1788 until the Irish Parliament was abolished with the Act of Union in 1801. In compensation for his seat being disenfranchised, he received ¬£15,000 from the crown (). He was later elected to the British House of Commons, serving as Member of Parliament for the Cornish constituency of Helston from 1807 to 1812, and for Aldeburgh in Suffolk from 1812 to 1818. He then sat in the House of Lords as a representative peer for Ireland from 1820 to 1836. He was High Sheriff of Down for 1804 and governor of County Down 1830‚Äì36. He served as aide-de-camp to King William IV. In 1794, he raised the 33rd Light Dragoons (also known as Ulster Regiment of Light Dragoons). He was also colonel of the North Downshire Militia. Marriage and death On 15 November 1801, Blackwood married Anne Dorothea, the only daughter of John Foster, 1st Baron Oriel and his wife, Margaretta Foster, 1st Viscountess Ferrard. They had no children. After a period of illness, Lord Dufferin died on 8 August 1836 at his home, Ballyleidy, age 81. He had been under treatment by Sir Henry Halford in London and then spent a week at the home of his brother-in-law, Thomas Skeffington, 2nd Viscount Ferrard, in County Louth. He died two days after returning home. He was succeeded in the titles by his younger brother Hans. Lady Blackwood died on 28 March 1865 aged 93.

History Evelyn Hawley was Loveland High School's first graduate, the only graduating member of the Class of 1881. Until 1926, Loveland City Schools operated as separate Loveland East and Loveland West districts, and each district had its own high school. Loveland West High School was located in present-day Loveland's central business district, in the building that now houses Loveland Elementary School. Loveland East High School was built by Cincinnati architect Samuel Hannaford on Broadway Street and has since been converted into a church. The unified high school, named Loveland Hurst High School, was eventually located on the Hamilton County side of the city. Ann Donahue, a Loveland High School graduate, modeled the set of the television show M.Y.O.B. after this building. It also featured in the made-for-TV movie The Pride of Jesse Hallam. Loveland High School's current facilities were built in 1994 to replace aging Hurst High School. Hurst was then converted into a middle school. Two years earlier, Loveland City Schools purchased land in Symmes Township, just outside Loveland city limits. The district signed a contract in which the City agreed to provide the new high school with water and sewage services; in return, the district would push for Hamilton County to annex the high school into Loveland at the city's request. In 2009, the Hamilton County Board of Commissioners allowed Loveland to annex the school. In November 2012 Loveland staged a production of Legally Blonde, the 2007 Broadway stage musical, directed by Sonja Hanson a local dancer and choreographer. Despite prior approval of the script and open rehearsals the administrators objected to the play and told Ms. Hanson \\"You need to resign or you will be terminated.\\"http://www.playbill.com/article/ohio-high-school-fires-director- for-staging-legally-blonde-musical-creators-and-parents-comment-com-200907 Extracurricular activities LHS has two competitive show choirs, the mixed- gender \\"By Request\\" and the women's-only \\"Allure\\".

The medication is available both alone and in combination with an estrogen.https://www.drugs.com/international/lynestrenol.html It is taken by mouth. Lynestrenol is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It has weak androgenic and estrogenic activity and no other important hormonal activity. The medication is a prodrug of norethisterone in the body, with etynodiol occurring as an intermediate. Lynestrenol was discovered in the late 1950s and was introduced for medical use in 1961. It has mostly been used in Europe and elsewhere in the world and was never marketed in the United States. Medical uses Lynestrenol is used as a component of oral contraceptives in combination with an estrogen and is used in the treatment of gynecological disorders such as menstrual disorders. Side effects Pharmacology Norethisterone (3-ketolynestrenol), the active metabolite of lynestrenol. Lynestrenol itself does not bind to the progesterone receptor and is inactive as a progestogen. It is a prodrug, and upon oral administration, is rapidly and almost completely converted into norethisterone, a potent progestogen, in the liver during first-pass metabolism. No other metabolites besides norethisterone are formed from lynestrenol. As such, its pharmacological activity is essentially identical to that of norethisterone. The conversion of lynestrenol into norethisterone is catalyzed by CYP2C9 (28.0%), CYP2C19 (49.8%), and CYP3A4 (20.4%), while other cytochrome P450 enzymes are each responsible for no more than 1.0% of the total conversion. It appears that lynestrenol first undergoes hydroxylation of the C3 position, forming etynodiol as an intermediate, followed by oxygenation of the hydroxyl group to form norethisterone. The peak blood levels are reached within 2 to 4 hours after oral administration, 97% of the administered dose being bound to plasma proteins. Lynestrenol and its metabolites are predominantly excreted in urine, less in feces, active metabolite norethisterone elimination half-life being 16 or 17 hours. The pharmacokinetics of lynestrenol have been reviewed. Chemistry Lynestrenol, also known as 17Œ±-ethynyl-3-desoxy-19-nortestosterone or as 17Œ±-ethynylestr-4-en-17Œ≤-ol, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of 19-nortestosterone. It differs from norethisterone (17Œ±-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) and etynodiol (17Œ±-ethynyl-3-deketo-3Œ≤-hydroxy-19-nortestosterone) only by the lack of a ketone group and hydroxyl group at the C3 position, respectively. =Synthesis= Chemical syntheses of lynestrenol have been published. In another approach to analogues, nortestosterone (1) is first converted to the dithioketal (2) by treatment with dithioglycol in the presence of boron trifluoride. (The mild conditions of this reaction compared to those usually employed in preparing the oxygen ketals probably accounts for the double bond remaining at 4,5). Treatment of this derivative with sodium in liquid ammonia affords the 3-desoxy analog (3). Oxidation by means of Jones reagent followed by ethynylation of the 17-ketone leads to the orally active progestin (6). Lynestrenol synthesis:M. S. de Winter, C. M. Siegmann and S. A. Szpilfogel, Chem. Ind., 905 (1959).http://www.chemspider.com/Search.aspx?q=Cingestol History Lynestrenol was developed by the Dutch pharmaceutical company Organon in the late 1950s and was introduced for medical use in 1961. It received a Dutch patent for lynestrenol in 1957, and lynestrenol subsequently became a component of Lyndiol, the first Dutch contraceptive pill, in 1962. Around this time, pre- and post-marketing clinical trials of lynestrenol were conducted, and in 1965, a study consisting of 200 Dutch women was published. Lynestrenol was approved, in the United Kingdom, in combination with mestranol in 1963 and in combination with ethinylestradiol in 1969.

Born in Paris, Antoine Menier was the eldest of the four sons of Georges Menier (1880‚Äì1933) and Simone Camille Marie Legrand (1881‚Äì1972). He studied at the Lyc√©e Condorcet in Paris but had little interest in business and did not go on to advanced studies. Instead, he used his wealth to pursue a life of sporting activities. An auto racing enthusiast, Antoine Menier set a number of records driving Alfa Romeo vehicles in hillclimbing events. In 1933 Antoine Menier became the mayor of Lognes, a town about south of the family's factories in Noisiel. He held the mayoral position until 1945 when his uncle Jacques Menier died. Since 1871, Menier family members had been the mayor of the town of Noisiel and Antoine replaced his uncle Jacques as Noisiel's mayor. He held that office until 1959 but was the last Menier to be the town's mayor. Ch√¢teau de Chenonceau As a result of his grandfather Gaston Menier's will, in 1935 Antoine Menier inherited Ch√¢teau de Chenonceau in France's Loire Valley. On Antoine's death his estate became the subject of a court battle and ultimately the ch√¢teau was acquired by his widowed sister-in-law, Odette. On her death in 1975, her son Jean-Louis Menier inherited it and made Chenonceau one of France's major tourist attractions. Decline of the Menier chocolate empire On his father's death in 1933, Gaston Menier became the co-managing head of the Menier Chocolate company with his brother Hubert. In spite of the difficult times of World War II, in 1950 Menier Chocolate was still the industry leader in France. However, Antoine Menier was ill-equipped to run the company and his brother Hubert lacked the leadership skills to overcome the growing number of problems in what had become an intensely competitive market. On Hubert's death in 1959 there was no Menier family member capable or desirous of replacing him. Married late in life to Parisian fashion model Ren√©e Vigne, Antoine Menier had no children and was the last of the Menier family to head the company. By 1960 the once mighty Menier Chocolate company was losing substantial amounts of money and merged with the Rozan chocolate company of Oloron-Sainte-Marie. A shell of its former self, the Menier workforce in Noisiel was soon reduced from a peak of more than 2,000 to just a few hundred. By 1965 the Menier family no longer held an interest in the company. Antoine Menier died in Paris in 1967.

Universal's Mummy films were inspired by worldwide interest in Egyptian archeology during the first half of the 20th century.  History  In the first Kharis film, The Mummy's Hand (1940), the character was played by Western-film actor Tom Tyler,Denis Gifford, Monsters of the Movies, p. 67 (Carousel Books, 1977). while the three subsequent films, The Mummy's Tomb (1942), The Mummy's Ghost (1944), and The Mummy's Curse (also 1944), starred Lon Chaney, Jr. in the role. Although the iconic image of the mummy's face is usually Karloff's, the Kharis films are responsible for the enduring stereotype of the lumbering, foot-dragging monster, as Karloff's bandaged creation is seen only briefly, while Kharis is a major on-screen character in all four follow-up films. The Kharis movies also introduce the notion of tana leaves as integral to the mummy's survival. The Mummy's Hand introduces Kharis in a series of flashbacks that are pulled from the original 1932 film (except for inserts with Tyler replacing Karloff in shots in which Karloff would have been conspicuous). The film The Mummy, which was released eight years before The Mummy's Hand, tells the story of the high priest Imhotep, who is punished for attempting to resurrect a dead lover, and thousands of years later returns to the Earth as a living mummy. However, in The Mummy's Hand the mummy is a high priest named Kharis and the details of the story are changed to describe a similar but alternate scenario. For this reason, the Kharis films are not sequels to the original, as occasionally misperceived. Christopher Lee portrayed Kharis in the 1959 Hammer horror film The Mummy. = Dark Universe = Kharis appears in The Mummy: Dark Universe Stories alongside The Mummy's Hand character Dr. Charles Petrie, set after the 2017 film The Mummy. The game retroactively establishes The Mummy films of the 1930s-1950s as part of the canonical chronology of the Dark Universe. Charles Trowbridge's likeness was used to represent his character Dr. Petrie in-game, while the likeness of Tom Tyler was used to represent Kharis.  Design  The make-up for Kharis was designed by Universal's resident monster expert Jack Pierce. While Tyler's features can be discerned easily under the make-up (as could Karloff's), Chaney is unrecognizable, due to the use of a mask rather than customized make-up over the course of the series (Pierce had earlier fashioned a mask for Tyler to wear for certain long shots in The Mummy's Hand, and the difference between the mask and the painstaking original make-up is fairly easy to spot on film). While in The Wolf Man Chaney played the starring role both in and out of makeup, Tyler was shown as the human Kharis in Chaney's Mummy films during flashback scenes, a somewhat demoralizing budgetary measure that showed Chaney's importance by this time to be mainly that of his famous name.

All firearms are designed, engineered, and handcrafted in Texas with 100% American materials and parts. On May 26, 2020, STI Firearms announced that the company will begin operating as Staccato, effective immediately.  Modular Frame  Staccato (formerly STI) is best known for its modular frame guns, and shares the patent on the modular frame with Strayer Voigt Inc. History In 1990, Virgil Tripp, a gunsmith and machinist, started building custom M1911s for competition use, especially the United States Practical Shooting Association/International Practical Shooting Confederation. After some time, Virgil began designing parts for 1911s, including electrical discharge machining (EDM) hammers and sears. Virgil's company was called Tripp Research, Inc. and most of his parts were sold and marketed by Chip McCormick, a champion pistol shooter, under his company's name, Chip McCormick Corporation (known as CMC). Around 1993, an engineer and computer aided design (CAD) expert named Sandy Strayer joined Tripp Research, Inc. Tripp and Strayer revolutionized the 1911 market by designing a modular high-capacity 1911 frame for International Practical Shooting Confederation shooters. Whilst Para Ordnance already had a high-capacity 1911 frame on the market, it was made of steel. The modular frame made use of a fibre-reinforced plastic which combined the trigger guard, grip, and integral magazine well. It used a proprietary grip which attached to the upper portion of the frame (a metal part that comprised the dust cover and frame rails). The result was that the modular frame weighed less than half of what the steel frame weighed. Furthermore, while the Para frame feels notably larger than a standard 1911 in the hand, the STI feels similar to a regular 1911 since the grips are moulded into the plastic of the frame rather than screwed to the outside. Tripp and Strayer were listed as the co-patent holders on the modular frame. Soon after the modular frame was introduced, the company name changed to STI (Strayer- Tripp, Inc.) and Strayer was given an equity stake in the new company. In June 1994, Sandy Strayer left STI to start a new company called Strayer Voigt Inc, which focuses on building completely custom pistols as opposed to the \\"semi- custom\\" models of STI. In November 1994, Dave and Shirley Skinner, owners of an electronics company named Tessco, Inc., became involved in the operation of STI along with Virgil Tripp. In early 1997, the Skinners completed their purchase of STI from Virgil Tripp and renamed the company to STI International, Inc. Virgil went on to start a new company using the name Tripp Research, Inc., which produces various finishes for firearms and magazines for 1911s. During the Clinton era high-capacity ban, STI remained in business by focusing on exports and the growing concealed-carry market. As of 2007, STI was the third-largest exporter of pistols in America. From 1994 to the late 1990s, STI had a custom shop which would build guns to customer's specifications. In January 2005, Dave Skinner sold the company to the employees of STI, making it the first employee-owned company in the fire-arms industry. In 2010, Tim Dillon was hired and made President and CEO, and later joined the Board of Directors. Dillon left the company in early 2014. In 2014, Greg Mooney joined STI as the President/CEO and a Member of the Board of Directors. In 2017, a private equity group, Westwind Investors, purchased STI. In 2020, STI announced its name change to Staccato. The company's website is https://staccato2011.com .https://staccato2011.com/about-us/news/press- release-sti-firearms-llc-announces-company-name-change-to-staccato/  Firearms  Today, Staccato manufactures a full range of 2011¬Æ pistols for shooters of all skill levels (home defenders, competition shooters, concealed carry, range shooting, and duty). The 2020 lineup of 2011¬Æ pistols consists of: Staccato C - Dawson¬Æ Universal Optic System. Designed for concealed carry, the Staccato C is a 9MM with a 3.9\\" barrel. Staccato C2. Designed for concealed carry, the Staccato C2 is a high capacity 9MM with a 3.9\\" barrel. The C2 can also be equipped with the Dawson¬Æ Universal Optic System to accommodate a range of optics. Staccato P. Designed for law enforcement, home defenders, and range shooters, the Staccato P is a high capacity 9MM with a 4.4\\" barrel. The Staccato P recently went through a stress test where it handled 11,000 rounds of steel cased ammunition with no failures. Like the C2, the P can be equipped with the Dawson¬Æ Universal Optic System for a range of optics. The Staccato P is used by law enforcement teams like the U.S. Marshall's SOG team, the Texas Rangers, and LAPD Metro. Staccato pistols are approved for use on duty by over 150 agencies across the country. Staccato R. Like a 1911, the Staccato R has a single-stack magazine and a full 5\\" slide and barrel, and comes in either 45ACP or 9MM. Staccato XL. Designed for range shooting and competition, the Staccato XL is popular with home defenders. It comes in 9MM or 40S&W; caliber and features a 5.4' bull barrel. Staccato XC. 9MM, 5\\" integrated compensated barrel, with the Dawson¬Æ Universal Optic System. Embraced by range shooters, home defenders, and competition shooters for its flat shooting and speed. Staccato also manufactures a full line of parts for 2011¬Æ and 1911 pistols, such as modular frame kits (which are used by gunsmiths to build complete guns), slides, barrels, compensators, triggers, hammers, thumb and grip safeties, slide stops, firing pins, guide rods, magazine wells, magazines, and scope mounts.

Opinions are in those jurisdictions usually published at the direction of the court, and to the extent, they contain pronouncements about what the law is and how it should be interpreted, they reinforce, change, establish, or overturn legal precedent. If a court decides that an opinion should be published, the opinion may be included in a volume from a series of books called law reports ('reporters' in the United States). Published opinions of courts are also collectively referred to as case law, and constitute in the common law legal systems one of the major sources of law. Memorandum opinion Not every case decided by a higher court results in the publication of an opinion; in fact many cases do not, since an opinion is often published only when the law is being interpreted in a novel way, or the case is a high-profile matter of general public interest and the court wishes to make the details of its ruling public. In the majority of US cases, the judges issue a memorandum decision that indicates how state or federal law applies to the case and affirms or reverses the decision of the lower court. A memorandum decision does not establish legal precedent or re-interpret the law, and cannot be invoked in subsequent cases to justify a ruling. Opinions, on the other hand, always establish a particular legal interpretation. Legal opinions of counsel or government law officers In the United Kingdom and other common law countries, a legal opinion also refers to written legal advice on a point of law issued by either a barrister or advocate (often referred to as \\"counsel's opinion\\") or occasionally a senior government law officer, such as an attorney general. Where the opinion is given by a foreign lawyer or foreign law firm it is usually referred to as a 'foreign legal opinion'. The latter form of opinion is sometimes made available to the public either because of public pressure (see for example Lord Goldsmith's opinion on the Iraq War, Yoo memo), or because a general clarification of the law is called for (see for example, the Yorke‚ÄìTalbot slavery opinion). In the United States, several state attorneys general issue attorney general's opinions. Several areas of commercial practice call for formal legal opinions of counsel. The Legal Aid scheme in the United Kingdom requires a legal opinion showing reasonable prospects for success before the Legal Aid board will fund any claim. Insurance policies for professional negligence will frequently require an opinion of counsel before the insurer is required to pay out on any putative claim (sometimes called a QC clause, when it must be an opinion of leading counsel).  Legal opinion in commercial transactions  In commercial transactions, particularly in the context of financing, the lender will require an opinion as to the corporate capacity of the borrower and enforceability of the transaction documents the borrower is intended to enter into. This type of opinion is generally issued by the borrower's counsel or the lender's counsel, depending on the ethical rule governing the issuance of those opinion applicable to the jurisdiction. When the subject company is from a foreign jurisdiction, the opinion will often be referred to as a foreign legal opinion.

Co-written with James Moran, it stars Danny Dyer and Laura Harris. The film tells a story of group of co-workers who go to a remote mountain forest in Hungary, where they become victims of murderous attacks. Severance received mostly positive reviews. In 2009, media interest in the film was revived following the alleged copycat murder of a UK teenager. The article contains relevant Flash video. Plot The film opens with George (David Gilliam) and two women (Juli Drajk√≥ and Judit Viktor) running through the woods. The women fall into a large pit trap while George is caught by a snare. As he hangs helplessly, a masked man approaches and disembowels him with a knife. What is later revealed as some days prior to this, the European Sales division of Palisade Defence military arms corporation are on a bus to a team-building weekend at a \\"luxury lodge\\" in the M√°tra Mountains of Hungary. When a fallen tree blocking the road halts the bus's progress, the driver (S√°ndor Boros) refuses to take a dirt road through the woods and, after an argument, drives off, leaving the group to walk the remaining distance to the lodge. Eventually the group reaches the lodge, which is old and in serious disrepair, but the manager, Richard (Tim McInnerny), convinces the wary but tired group to enter. Inside, Harris (Toby Stephens) discovers a file cabinet full of cryptic Palisade documents, written in Russian. The group discusses the documents, leading Harris to relate a story he'd heard about the lodge: the lodge was previously a mental institution, and in the early 20th century a Palisade-made nerve gas was used to clear it out after the inmates took over. Jill (Claudie Blakley) responds with the story she'd heard: the lodge was a \\"reeducation center\\" for Russian war criminals, and after an escape a Palisade-made nerve gas was used to clear escapees out of nearby buildings. Both mention a lone survivor who swore revenge on Palisade. Steve (Danny Dyer) starts to tell his own story about the lodge's past as a clinic staffed by busty nurses when he finds a human tooth in the meat pie the group is eating for dinner. Chastising Gordon (Andy Nyman) for serving a pie he just found in the kitchen, everyone goes to bed. That night Jill sees someone looking into the lodge from the trees. Though nobody is found outside, everyone but Richard agrees that they should leave the lodge. The next morning Richard grudgingly sends Harris and Jill to the top of the hill to call the bus driver back, on the condition that the rest participate in a team-building game of paintball. Reaching the hill, Harris and Jill find the bus abandoned and the bus driver dead in a nearby creek. Back at the lodge, the game of paintball has just finished when Gordon steps into a bear trap. After several failed attempts by Steve and Billy (Babou Ceesayu) to pry the trap open, Gordon's left leg is cut through completely under the knee. Harris and Jill arrive in the bus, load everyone in and head back for town. On the way, a spike strip is thrown in front of the bus, which causes it to crash. Harris is thrown clear of the bus in the crash, and is decapitated by a masked killer with a machete. Jill is captured and tied to a tree, gagged, doused with gasoline, and burned alive. The rest discover Harris's body, prompting them to head back to the lodge for the night. While Steve and Maggie (Laura Harris) smoke, a masked figure (Levente T√∂rk√∂ly) \\"quietly\\" grabs Gordon and carries him into the basement. Discovering Gordon's absence and a newly opened door, the four head into the basement which leads to an underground prison. Through one door Billy and Maggie find the now-dead Gordon, who has had the Palisade logo carved into his torso, and a now-unmasked killer who fires a shotgun at them. The two hide in a nearby cell, where Billy dies from a chest wound. Steve hides on the second floor while Richard escapes out the back into the woods. While the killer searches for Steve, Maggie sneaks up on him with a large knife she took from the prison in the basement, but she falls through the rickety floor. The killer turns around and takes aim at Maggie, but, at the last second, Steve saves her by impaling the killer through the back. The killer falls down and becomes lodged in the main level floor, and Maggie takes his shotgun and shoots the killer in the head. Believing they are safe Maggie and Steve exit the lodge, but discover that a group of several more armed, Russian-speaking killers, are awaiting them outside. Maggie shoots one before he can fire on them, and the two run into the woods. They come across Richard, who has stepped on a Palisade-made land mine and cannot move without detonating it. Richard guides Maggie and Steve through the minefield. The killers know that the area is a minefield and do not enter; they use a fallen branch to pass over the minefield close to Richard and torment him with insults and stones as they pass overhead. Accepting his situation, Richard does his best to save the others and steps off the mine, killing himself as well as two of the killers. Steve and Maggie come to another building, the real Palisade lodge. Inside they find their boss George, who is partying with two escorts Steve ordered via the Internet earlier. George brings out a prototype missile launcher and fires it at the approaching killers, but the missile locks on to a passing commercial jet instead, destroying it. The five run into the woods, leading to the events shown in the beginning of the film. Maggie is snared and is about to be molested by a killer when she manages to smash his head with a rock. Steve encounters two attackers and gets beaten and stabbed, but eventually kills them both with a knife and a submachine gun. Maggie is chased by a flamethrower-wielding killer into an abandoned prison camp, filled with crates bearing the Palisade logo. There, Maggie breaks her leg, but is saved when one of the escorts, rescued by Steve, arrives and shoots the man. Steve, Maggie and the escorts make it to a rowboat on the shore of the nearby lake, and as they paddle off to safety Steve jokingly quips, \\"Foursome?\\" Cast *Laura Harris as Maggie *Claudie Blakley as Jill *Toby Stephens as Harris *Andy Nyman as Gordon *Babou Ceesay as Billy *Tim McInnerny as Richard *Danny Dyer as Steve *David Gilliam as George *Juli Drajk√≥ as Olga *Judit Viktor as Nadia *S√°ndor Boros as Coach Driver Release =Home video= Severance was released in the United Kingdom on DVD by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on 8 January 2007.

The typical motorcycle has a pair of fork tubes for the front suspension, and a swingarm with one or two shock absorbers for the rear suspension.  Front suspension  The most common form of front suspension for a modern motorcycle is the telescopic fork. Other fork designs are girder forks, suspended on sprung parallel links (not common since the 1940s) and bottom leading link designs, not common since the 1960s. Vincent Black Lightning with Girdraulic front suspension Some manufacturers (e.g. Greeves) used a version of the swinging arm for front suspension on their motocross designs. A single-sided version of the idea is also used in motor scooters such as the Vespa. The hub-center steering as developed by Ascanio Rodorigo, on a concept associated to Massimo Tamburini is a complex front swingarm alternative system that entails suspension and steering, as seen in projects such as Bimota Tesi and Vyrus motorcycles. = Telescopic forks = Scott produced a motorcycle with telescopic forks in 1908, and would continue to use them until 1931. In 1935 BMW became the first manufacturer to produce a motorcycle with hydraulically damped telescopic forks. Most motorcycles today use telescopic forks for the front suspension. The forks can be most easily understood as simply large hydraulic shock absorbers with internal coil springs. They allow the front wheel to react to imperfections in the road while isolating the rest of the motorcycle from that motion. Telescopic forks on a 1969 BMW The top of the forks are connected to the motorcycle's frame in a triple tree clamp (known as a \\"yoke\\" in the UK), which allows the forks to be turned in order to steer the motorcycle. The bottom of the forks is connected to the front wheel's axle. On conventional telescopic forks, the lower portion or fork bodies (\\"fork sliders\\" in the UK), slide up and down the fork tubes (\\"fork stanchions\\" in the UK). The fork tubes must be mirror-smooth to seal the fork oil inside the fork. Some fork tubes, especially on early roadsters and off-road motorcycles, are enclosed in plastic protective \\"gaiters. \\"Upside-down\\" (USD) forks, also known as inverted forks, are installed inverted compared to conventional telescopic forks. The slider bodies are at the top, fixed in the triple clamps, and the stanchion tubes are at the bottom, fixed to the axle. This USD arrangement has two advantages: (i) it decreases the unsprung weight of the motorcycle; and (ii) it increases torsional stiffness, which can improve handling. Two disadvantages of USD forks are: (i) they are more expensive than conventional telescopic forks; and (ii) they are liable to lose all their damping oil should an oil seal fail. USD forks are typically found on sportbikes, though the Honda Valkyrie featured USD forks.  Pre-load adjustment  Motorcycle suspensions are designed so that the springs are always under compression, even when fully extended. Pre-load is used to adjust the initial position of the suspension with the weight of the motorcycle and rider acting on it. The difference between the fully extended length of the suspension and the length compressed by the weight of the motorcycle and rider is called \\"total sag\\" or \\"race sag\\". Total sag is set to optimize the initial position of the suspension to avoid bottoming out or topping out under normal riding conditions. \\"Bottoming out\\" occurs when the suspension is compressed to the point where it mechanically cannot compress any more. Topping out occurs when the suspension extends fully and cannot mechanically extend any more. Increasing pre-load increases the initial force on the spring thereby reducing total sag. Decreasing pre-load decreases the initial force in the spring thereby increasing total sag. Some motorcycles allow adjustment of pre-load by changing the air pressure inside the forks. Valves at the top of the forks allow air to be added or released from the fork. More air pressure gives more pre-load, and vice versa.  Fork damping  Basic fork designs use a simple damper-rod system, in which damping is controlled by the passage of fork oil through an orifice. Though cheap to manufacture, it is hard to tune such forks, as they tend to give too little damping at low slider speeds, yet too much damping at higher slider speeds. Any adjustment setting will always be a compromise, giving both over- mushy and over-stiff damping. Since forks act as hydraulic dampers, changing the weight of the fork oil will alter the damping rate. Some telescopic forks have external adjustments for damping. A more sophisticated approach is the cartridge fork, which use internal cartridges with a valving system. Damping at low slider speeds is controlled by a much smaller orifice, but damping at higher slider speeds is controlled by a system of flexible shims, which act as a bypass valve for the fork oil. This valve has a number of such shims of varying thicknesses that cover the orifices in the valve to control the damping of the fork on high and medium speed bumps. Some of the shims (or \\"leaf springs\\") lift with little force allowing fluid to flow through the orifice. Other springs require greater force to lift and allow flow. This gives the fork digressive damping, allowing it to be stiff over small bumps, yet relatively softer over larger bumps. Also, the springs (or shims) only allow flow in one direction, so one set of springs controls compression damping, and another rebound damping. This allows the dampings to be set separately. Cartridge emulators are aftermarket parts that make damper-rod forks behave virtually as cartridge forks.http://www.racetech.com/page/title/Emulators-How%20They%20Work The damping orifice in the damper-rod is made so large that it has virtually no effect on damping, and instead an \\"emulator\\" takes over the damping function. The emulator has a very small orifice for low fork-speed damping, and an adjustable shim-stack for high fork-speed damping. Gas-charged cartridge forks, which became available in 2007, consist of gas-charged cartridges fitted within standard forks. This kit is suitable for supersport classes of racing, where regulations prohibit a complete fork replacement but allow modification of the original forks.  Brake dive  Applying the brakes of a moving motorcycle increases the load borne by the front wheel and decrease the load borne by the rear wheel due to a phenomenon called load transfer. For a detailed explanation and a sample calculation, see the braking section of the Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics article. Earles fork eliminated and reversed brake dive If the motorcycle is equipped with telescopic forks, the added load on the front wheel is transmitted through the forks, which compress. This shortening of the forks causes the front end of the bike to move lower, and this is called brake dive. Telescopic forks are particularly prone to this, unlike leading link designs. Brake dive can be disconcerting to the rider, who may feel like he or she is about to be thrown over the front of the motorcycle. If the bike dives so far as to bottom out the front forks, it can also cause handling and braking problems. One of the purposes of a suspension is to help maintain contact between the tire and road. If the suspension has bottomed out, it is no longer moving as it should, and is no longer helping to maintain contact. While excessive brake dive is disconcerting, and bottoming out can cause loss of traction, a certain amount of brake dive reduces the rake and trail of the motorcycle, allowing it to turn more easily. This is especially important to racers trail braking on entrance to corners. Brake dive with telescopic forks can be reduced by either increasing the spring rate of the fork springs, or increasing the compression damping of the forks. However, all of these changes make the motorcycle less pleasant to ride on rough roads, since the front end will feel stiffer, in the 1980s various manufacturers attempted to get round this by methods of anti- dive such as: Honda TRAC *ACT: Developed by Marzocchi and fitted to Buell motorcycles such as the Buell RR 1200 (1988). *ANDF (Anti Nose Dive Forks): This was fitted to a number of Suzuki GSX models and the RG250. *AVDS (Automatic Variable Damping System): This was fitted to a number of Kawasaki motorcycles. *NEAS (New Electrically Activated Suspension): As fitted to the Suzuki GSX-R 1100 and GSX-R 750 Limited Edition. *PDF (Posi Damp Fork): This was fitted to the Suzuki RG500, the GSX1100E/GS1150E and GSX-R 750 and was an enhancement of the previous Anti Dive units (which works by brake fluid pressure closing a valve in the mechanism when the brakes are applied, restricting the flow of damping oil and slowing fork compression). The PDF units works in a similar way, except that they rely entirely on the compression stroke itself. The valves are spring-loaded so if the wheel hits a bump, they bounce off their seats and restore the flow of oil for a moment to allow the suspension to absorb the shock. *TCS (Travel Control System): Anti- dive system with variable damping. TCS was introduced on the FZ 400 R (1984, only for the Japanese market). *TRAC (Torque Reactive Anti-dive Control): This was fitted to a number of Honda motorcycles such as the CB1100F, CB1000C, and VFR750F and worked by utilizing a pivoting caliper that activated a valve in the fork leg. With the advent of cartridge forks, which allow more low speed damping and less high speed damping than the previous damping rod forks, separate anti-dive mechanisms have generally fallen out of use. Another method to reduce or eliminate brake dive in telescopic forks is to use a reactive link or torque arm to connect the braking components to the motorcycle frame via the triple clamp. Some fork designs mitigate dive, eliminate it, or even reverse it without affecting the front suspension adversely. The Earles fork is among the latter; when braking the front brake hard, the front end of the motorcycle actually rises. BMW's Telelever fork is designed to nearly eliminate dive, and could have been designed to eliminate it completely if the manufacturer chose to do so. Leading link front forks, such as used on some Ural motorcycles, can also be designed either to reduce or eliminate dive.  Saxon-Motodd (Telelever) fork  BMW R1200c with TeleleverThe Saxon- Motodd (marketed as Telelever by BMW) has an additional swingarm that mounts to the frame and supports the spring. This causes the rake and trail to increase during braking instead of decreasing as with traditional telescopic forks. = Hossack/Fior (Duolever) fork = The Hossack/Fior (marketed as Duolever by BMW) separates completely the suspension from steering forces. It was developed by Norman Hossack though used by Claude Fior and John Britten on racebikes. Hossack himself described the system as a 'steered upright'. In 2004 BMW announced the K1200S with a new front suspension that is based upon this design. = Single-sided = A single-sided front swingarm suspension was used on the Yamaha GTS1000, introduced in 1993. The GTS used the RADD, Inc. front suspension designed by James Parker. A single sided girder fork was use on the German Imme R100 motorcycle between 1949 and 1951, and the Vespa scooter has a single-sided trailing-link fork. More recently, between 1998 and 2003, the ItalJet \\"Dragster\\" scooter also used a single-sided swingarm suspension, though unlike the GTS1000 there was no upper control arm; the upper part of the suspension on the Dragster served only to transmit steering input. = Hub-center steering= Hub-center steering is characterized by a swingarm that extends from the bottom of the engine/frame to the centre of the front wheel instead of a fork. The advantages of using a hub-center steering system instead of a more conventional motorcycle fork are that hub-center steering separates the steering, braking, and suspension functions. With a fork the braking forces are put through the suspension, a situation that leads to the suspension being compressed, using up a large amount of suspension travel which makes dealing with bumps and other road irregularities extremely difficult. As the forks dive the steering geometry of the bike also changes making the bike more nervous, and inversely on acceleration becomes more lazy. Also, having the steering working through the forks causes problems with stiction, decreasing the effectiveness of the suspension. The length of the typical motorcycle fork means that they act as large levers about the headstock requiring the forks, the headstock, and the frame to be very robust adding to the bike's weight. The endurance racer \\"Nessie\\", built by the Mead & Tomkinson racing team, used an adapted version of Difazio hub-center steering, whereby braking forces were directed to the frame via a pivoted fork (rather than through the steering head). This allowed neutral steering and an absence of brake dive.  Rear suspension  Plunger rear suspension on a BMW R51/3 = Early rear suspensions = While front suspensions were almost universally adopted before World War I, several manufacturers did not use rear suspension on their bikes until after World War II. However, motorcycles with rear suspension were offered to the public before World War I. Notable among these are the 1909 A.S.L. which had both front and rear pneumatic suspensionThe A.S.L. Spring-Frame Motor Bicycle, The Motor Cycle, 7 Jul 1909, p502, the 1913 Indian Single with a swingarm suspended from a leaf spring and the 1913 Pope with wheels supported on a pair of plungers which were each suspended by a coil spring.  Plunger suspension  Several motorcycles before and immediately after World War II used plunger suspension in which the vertical movement of the rear axle was controlled by plungers suspended by springs. Notable manufacturers of bikes with plunger suspension include Adler, Ariel, BMW, BSA, Indian, MZ, Sarol√©a, Norton, Cossack/Ural and Z√ºndapp. Although plunger suspension could be sophisticated, with springing and damping in both compression and rebound, it had three disadvantages (compared to the almost universal swingarm that succeeded it), as follows: (i) wheel travel was limited, (ii) the wheel could move out of the required vertical axis, and (iii) it was more expensive to produce and maintain. = Swingarms = The basic motorcycle swingarm is a quadrilateral, with one short side connected to the motorcycle's frame with bearings so that it can pivot. The other short side is the rear axle around which the rear wheel turns. The long sides are connected to the motorcycle's frame or rear sub-frame with one or two shocks with coil-over springs. In production motorcycles, swingarms are not exactly rectangular, but their function can be more easily understood by thinking of them as such. Moto Guzzi's CA.R.C.When a swingarm is present on only one side of the motorcycle, this is known as a single-sided swingarm. In 1981 BMW introduced the single sided swingarm (mono lever) to motorcycles on their R 80 GS model. Notable examples include the Honda VFR800 and the BMW R- and K-series. Single-sided swingarms make rear-wheel removal easier, though they generally increase the unsprung weight of the rear suspension. This is due to the additional material required to give identical torsional rigidity to a conventional (two-sided) swingarm setup. For this reason sports bikes are rarely seen using the setup. Notable exclusions are the Ducati 916 which was intended to be taken endurance racing, the MV Agusta f4 which has a hollow interior for reduced weight (a magnesium version is also available), and the Ducati 1098, which was given a single sided swingarm purely for styling reasons. R1200GS On many shaft-drive motorcycles the drive shaft is contained in one of the long sides of the swingarm. Notable examples include all post-1955 BMW models prior to BMW's use of the single-sided swingarms, Urals, many Moto Guzzi twins, the Honda Goldwing, the Yamaha XS Eleven, and the Yamaha FJR1300. The BMW R- and K-series combine a shaft-drive contained in the swing arm with a single-sided swingarm, and the combination is marketed as the Paralever. Newer Moto Guzzi motorcycles use a similar arrangement marketed as the CA.R.C. (\\"CArdano Reattivo Compatto\\" - Compact Reactive Shaft Drive). For motorcycles with chain drives, the rear axle can usually be adjusted forward and back in relation to the swingarm, to adjust chain tension, but a few models (such as some 1971/72 Triumph and BSA four-strokes and Ducati 860 GTS and Darmah 900s ) make the adjustment at the swingarm's pivot point. = Shock absorbers = The hydraulic shock absorbers used on the rear suspensions of motorcycles are essentially the same as those used in other vehicle applications. Motorcycle shocks do differ slightly in that they nearly always use a coil-over spring. In other words, the spring for the rear suspension is a coil spring that is installed over, or around, the shock. In terms of adjustment, rear shocks span the range from no adjustments whatsoever to pre- load adjustments only to racing shocks with adjustments for length, pre-load, and four different kinds of damping. Most shocks have internal oil reservoirs, but some have external ones, and some offer air-assisted damping. A number of companies offer custom-built rear shocks for motorcycles. These shocks are assembled for a specific motorcycle and rider combination, taking into account the characteristics of the motorcycle, the weight of the rider, and the rider's preferred riding style/aggressiveness.  Twin shock absorbers  Twin shock refers to motorcycles that have two shock absorbers. Generally, this term is used to denote a particular era of motorcycles, and is most frequently used when describing off-road motorcycles. During the late 1970s and 1980s, motorcycle rear suspension design and performance underwent tremendous advances. The primary goal and result of these advances were increased rear wheel travel, as measured in how far the rear wheel could move up and down. Before this period of intense focus on rear suspension performance, most off-road motorcycles had rear wheel travel of about 3.5-4 inch (9-10 cm). At the end of this period, most of these motorcycles had rear wheel travel of approximately 12 inch (30 cm). At the beginning of this period, various rear suspension designs were used to reach this degree of performance. However, by the end of this period, a design consisting of using only one shock absorber (instead of two) was universally accepted and used. The performance of single shock absorber suspensions was vastly superior to twin shock motorcycles. Accordingly, this design distinction is readily used to categorize motorcycles. With the exception of Bentley and Draper system (New Imperial and Brough Superior machines) and the HRD (later Vincent) system both developed and patented in the 1920s it is only since the 1980s that monoshock motorcycles have been the norm, the term \\"twinshock\\" is now used to categorize vintage motorcycles. This distinction is important in that it provides classes used for vintage motorcycle competition. For example, vintage motocross races are held for older motocross motorcycles. To prevent the better-performing monoshock motorcycles from dominating the competition, there are separate competition classes for monoshock and twinshock motorcycles, which prevents them from competing directly against each other.  Single shock absorber  On a motorcycle with a single shock absorber rear suspension, a single shock absorber connects the rear swingarm to the motorcycle's frame. Typically this lone shock absorber is in front of the rear wheel, and uses a linkage to connect to the swing arm. Such linkages are frequently designed to give a rising rate of damping for the rear. In 1972, Yamaha introduced the Mono-Shock single shock absorber rear suspension system on their motorcycles competing in the Motocross World Championships. The suspension which was designed by Lucien Tilkens, became so successful that other motorcycle manufacturers developed their own single shock absorber designs. Honda's version is called Pro-link, Kawasaki's is Uni-Trak, and Suzuki's is Full-Floater. Honda's Unit Pro-Link, used first on the Honda RC211V MotoGP racer, and then on the 2003 Honda CBR600RR sport bike, is intended to isolate the frame and the steering head from undesirable forces transmitted by the rear suspension by having the dampers upper mount contained within the rear swingarm subframe, rather than connecting it to the frame itself.

Organization and governance  The Hennepin County Law Library is organized under Chapter 134AMinnesota statutes, Chapter 134A of the Minnesota Statutes. The governing agency is a seven-member Board of Trustees consisting of three judges of the Fourth Judicial District, three practicing attorneys, and a member of the Hennepin County Board of Commissioners.Hennepin County Board of Commissioners The library, which is open to the public, is funded by a combination of court fees, user fees, and an appropriation from the Hennepin County general revenue fund.  History  The Hennepin County Law Library had its origin when the Minneapolis Bar Association incorporated on February 20, 1883. The Bar Association was a stock corporation that allowed members to pay for stock by contributing books, the value of which was determined by an appraisal committee. The law library's first location was a room on the second floor of a building on Nicollet Avenue adjoining the First National Bank at Washington Avenue. In August 1883 the collection was moved to the Academy of Music Building, at the corner of Washington and Hennepin Avenues. This magnificent building, a showplace for the arts and the center of the city's entertainment district, was gutted by fire on Christmas Day, 1884. The law library was completely destroyed. With the insurance proceeds of $15,000, the Bar Association began rebuilding the law library, which opened in the Boston Block on May 1, 1885. This was another famous building that boasted the first indoor court in Minneapolis. But in April 1886, it was also struck by fire, destroying the law library for a second time. With the insurance of $20,000, a third law library was established in the Temple Court building, which occupied the site of the former Academy of Music Building. By 1895 the law library contained about 7,000 volumes. In 1903 it was provided accommodations in Room 434 of the new Court House and City Hall building. In 1960 the law library moved to Room 318, where it remained until its move in September 1976 to its present location in the Hennepin County Government Center. The law library is named for Anne W. Grande, who served as law librarian for 33 years, from 1975 to 2008. The law library was renovated in the summer of 2016.  Staff  According to a 1941 Hennepin Lawyer article by Thomas Kneeland, one of the incorporators of the Minneapolis Bar Association, the Bar Association employed three librarians during the time it owned the law library. Kneeland listed the first as Edward S. Waters, though a newspaper article on December 26, 1884 in the Minneapolis Evening Journal stated that F. S. Gaylord was the librarian at the time of the Christmas Day fire. The History of the Bench and Bar of Minnesota, by Hiram F. Stevens (Minneapolis: Legal Publishing and Engraving Co., 1904) lists E.S. Waters as Treasurer of the Minneapolis Bar Association in 1904. Kneeland listed the second librarian as Frederic Klapp, who was succeeded in 1921 by his son, S. D. Kapp, who served until his death in 1937. Hennepin County law librarians include Lillian W. Taylor (1937-1944), Buelah C. Blaisdell (1944-1948), Ethel Kommes (1948-1975), Anne Grande (1975-2008), Ed Carroll (2008‚Äì2015), Karen Westwood (2015-current).Hennepin County Law Library About Page External links * Hennepin County Law Library website. * Board of Trustees References Category:Libraries in Minnesota Category:Law libraries Category:Buildings and structures in Minneapolis Category:Education in Minneapolis ","title":"Hennepin County Law Library"},{"id":"6663632","title":"List of municipalities in Acre"},{"id":"6663677","text":"Nikolay Koslov (1928 - 2007) was a Soviet/Russian cross country skier who competed in the 1950s.

Early life and education Aldrich was born in Palmyra and suffered from poor health as a young boy. He attended public schools and a military academy at West Chester, Pennsylvania before enrolling at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York.

Alabama coalfield development Aldrich's career was characterized by innovation and long-term vision. His strength was in finding new resources, developing them and then moving on to the next discovery. He was an honorable man in science as well as in business. In 1872, Aldrich became a partner in a banking enterprise in Selma, Alabama. While in the region, he investigated the existing coal-mining operations at Montevallo and around the Cahaba Coal Field. The next year he secured a lease on the Montevallo coal mines and set to work extracting coal that summer. He purchased the mines outright in 1875 and named the surrounding settlement Aldrich, leasing the operation to his younger brother William while he prospected for new seams. He incorporated the Jefferson Coal Company in the town of Morris, from which he supplied fuel for the first successful coke- fired furnace in the Birmingham District, helping to establish the area as a center of iron and steel production. In 1881 Aldrich founded the Cahaba Coal Company in Bibb County. After building a railroad connector, the company laid out a \\"model community\\" on the bank of Caffee Creek. After seeing a \\"ton block\\" of coal brought from the mine, Aldrich named the town Blocton. Blocton coal earned a reputation as an efficient fuel for steam locomotives and the profitable company embarked on a period of great expansion. Aldrich advertised widely for miners who arrived from all over the United States, as well as Western and Central Europe. By the summer of 1890 over 3,600 people were residents of Blocton and products from the companies' mines and ovens were being sold to customers throughout the Southeast and parts of Latin America. In addition to his many business interests, Aldrich pursued a lifelong fascination with shell collecting, eventually amassing one of the largest amateur collections of his time, partly by purchase and partly by collecting in person. In the 1890s he joined a \\"Shell Syndicate\\" to support naturalists Herbert Huntington Smith and Amelia W. (Daisy) Smith, who collected freshwater and terrestrial mollusks in Alabama and Georgia. State Geologist Eugene Allen Smith encouraged Aldrich to concentrate his efforts in the Tertiary paleontology of the Coastal Plain, often sending him material to identify, and Aldrich collected thousands of fossils from now-classic sites along the Alabama and Tombigbee Rivers, such as Claiborne. He contributed an article to Bulletin 1 of the Geological Survey of Alabama on the state's Eocene fossil record, including nine plates illustrating new species. His collection of modern shells is now in the Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville, and his fossil shells are in the Geological Survey of Alabama Paleontological Collection and the Alabama Museum of Natural History. Aldrich also supplied information on the coal fields he had surveyed to John Witherspoon Dubose and to Squire's Report on the Cahaba Coal Field published by the Geological Survey of Alabama in 1890. Later career In 1890 Aldrich faced a major labor strike initiated by the United Mine Workers of America. He defeated this strike by hiring, for the first time, African Americans to operate the mine. In 1892 Aldrich sold the combined Cahaba and Excelsior Coal Company to the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company. Aldrich became a second vice- president and general manager for TCI. As an executive of that company he secured investments that helped TCI survive the depression of 1893, including a contribution of grain and flour from B. B. Comer. He moved his residence from Blocton to Birmingham. In 1896 Aldrich secured the Republican nomination to the 54th United States Congress by contesting the election of Oscar W. Underwood. As a Republican in a largely Democratic state, Aldrich served for less than a year before being defeated by Underwood in the 1896 election. He returned to the coal business as president of the Cahaba Southern Mining Company, which operated mines at Hargrove in Bibb County. In 1899 be became a vice-president of the Birmingham Machinery and Foundry Company and, two years later, was named the acting president of the Sloss-Sheffield Steel & Iron Company. He also opened the Virginia mines, which were the site of a tragic explosion in 1905 in Hueytown, Alabama that killed over 100 miners. In 1902 Aldrich joined his son in a prospecting venture in Tallapoosa County called the Hillabee Gold Company. In 1905 he bought the Montevallo Mining Company back and served until 1910 as its president. In 1911 President William Howard Taft, who had been a neighbor in Cincinnati, Ohio, appointed him as Postmaster of Birmingham. Aldrich's paleontological hobby became his career in later life, when Eugene Allen Smith appointed him as Curator of Paleontology of the Alabama Museum of Natural History. He donated large collections of Southeastern fossils, many from sites that are no longer exposed today. Under Herbert Huntington Smith and Daisy Smith, who were hired in 1909, the Museum continued his species-based cataloging system for fossils and Aldrich continued to write short articles on Tertiary mollusks. His research into the area's paleontology earned him wide esteem and he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Alabama. He described over 200 species.Johnson C. W.

In 1930, the octogenarian Aldrich named new ichnogenera of fossil footprints that were discovered in a University of Alabama coalmine in Walker County, Alabama‚Äîhis only venture into the field of ichnology. Although his descriptions were brief, the well-reproduced photographic plates brought this work to renewed attention when similar trackways were discovered in 1999 at the nearby Union Chapel Mine (now the Stephen C.

Blake was also a close friend of Aldrich and named his only son Truman Aldrich Blake. J.H. Blake's daughter, Laura Blake Murphy, named her first son Truman Burgess Murphy, and he named his first son Truman Burgess Murphy Jr. Truman Aldrich died in 1932 at the age of 83 and was buried in Birmingham's Elmwood Cemetery.

Fame and honours usually go to the first person or group to publish a new finding, even if several researchers arrived at the same conclusion independently and at the same time. Thus between two or more independent discoverers, the first to publish is the legitimate winner. Hence, the tradition is often referred to as the priority rule, the procedure of which is nicely summed up in a phrase \\"publish or perish\\", because there are no second prizes. In a way, the race to be first inspires risk-taking that can lead to scientific breakthroughs which is beneficial to the society (such as discovery of malaria transmission, DNA, HIV, etc.). On the other hand, it can create an unhealthy competition and incentives to publish poorly supported findings (quantity over quality), which can be detrimental to scientific progress. Priority disputes Priority becomes a difficult issue usually in the context of priority disputes, where the priority for a given theory, understanding, or discovery comes into question. In most cases historians of science disdain retrospective priority disputes as enterprises which generally lack understanding about the nature of scientific change and usually involve gross misreadings of the past to support the idea of a long-lost priority claim. Historian and biologist Stephen Jay Gould once remarked that \\"debates about the priority of ideas are usually among the most misdirected in the history of science.\\"Gould SJ (1977). Ontogeny and Phylogeny. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, p. 35. Richard Feynman told Freeman Dyson that he avoided priority disputes by \\"Always giv[ing] the bastards more credit than they deserve.\\" Dyson remarked that he also follows this rule, and that this practice is \\"remarkably effective for avoiding quarrels and making friends.\\" Freeman Dyson, 2011, \\"The Dramatic Picture of Richard Feynman, \\" New York Review of Books, July 14, 2011. Reprinted in Origin The priority rule came into existence before or as soon as modern scientific methods were established. For example, the earliest documented controversy was a bitter claim between Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the 17th century about priority in the invention of calculus. This particular incidence clearly shows human biases and prejudice. It has become unanimously accepted that both the mathematicians independently developed calculus. Since then priority has caused a number of historical maladies in the history of science. In the cases of scientists who have since achieved incredible levels of popularity, such as Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein, priority disputes may arise when similarities in previous research are identified. This can give rise to suspicions for plagiarism and often requires a thorough historical source analysis.

A common spelling variation of his first name in reference works and websites is Claude, however in his works Charteris uses the spelling without the 'e'. History Teal was a London-based police detective for Scotland Yard, with which he initially held the rank of Inspector. He first appeared not in a Saint story, but in a 1929 novel entitled Daredevil as a friend of that book's hero, \\"Storm\\" Arden. When Charteris decided to launch an ongoing series of stories featuring his Robin Hood-inspired anti-hero, Simon Templar (a.k.a. The Saint) in late 1929, he imported the character of Teal though it's not known if Daredevil plays any role in the actual continuity of the Saint series. (The first Saint story, 1928's Meet - The Tiger!, predated Daredevil and featured a character named Detective Carn, who was a template for the later Teal). Backstory Teal first appeared opposite Simon Templar in several novella-length stories that appeared in the UK magazine Thriller in the spring and summer of 1929; several were published in 1930 as the collection Enter the Saint (which is where most readers were first exposed to Teal), though the earliest stories in the series would not be published in book form until they were rewritten and included in a later collection, Featuring the Saint. At some point, Teal received a promotion to Chief Inspector and he is identified with this rank for the first time in the short story collection The Brighter Buccaneer. Teal is described as a heavy set, blue-eyed, perpetually weary policeman who, instead of smoking (a common behaviour during the era), chews gum incessantly. Little if any family life is indicated for the character. According to Daredevil, however, he had married at the age of 22. It isn't known whether Teal chews gum in an attempt to quit smoking; the Wrigley's Spearmint brand is frequently mentioned by name (and even illustrated on the cover of some editions of Saint books that involve Teal). Teal's relationship with Templar varies throughout the long-running Saint series. In the earliest parts, \\"The Saint\\" was a mysterious criminal that Teal was hunting. In the later part, Teal already knows The Saint is Simon Templar, gets to know him very well - but finds it difficult to obtain proof of his law-breaking that would stand in court. Sometimes they are adversaries, with Teal striving to put Templar behind bars and stop his \\"law- bending\\" crimefighting ways. Templar, in return, baits Teal frequently and in The Holy Terror goes so far as to blackmail Teal (an action that earns Templar a rare rebuke from his girlfriend and partner, Patricia Holm, in the later book, Once More the Saint). At other times, Teal and Templar maintain a cordial relationship bordering on friendship. Indeed, in several of the early Saint books (including The Holy Terror), Teal states outright that he would consider Templar a friend if they weren't on the opposite sides of the law. For his part, Templar is shown to always have a fresh stick of chewing gum ready to give to Teal during his frequent visits, though Teal is less appreciative of Templar's habit of poking him in his expansive belly whenever he wants to emphasize a point (or sometimes just for the fun of it, as occurs several times in The Misfortunes of Mr. Teal). Despite giving an air of being weary and slow-moving, Teal is a brilliant detective, and one whom Templar occasionally underestimates. He also has demonstrated the ability to exhibit surprising dexterity and speed when the need arises. (In one early story, he braves entering a gas-filled cellar ‚Äì at grave risk of being gassed to death himself ‚Äì in order to carry an unconscious Templar to safety, an action he later half-jokingly regrets.) In The Misfortunes of Mr. Teal, Charteris states outright that Teal's weary, sloth-like demeanor is an affectation. In several Saint stories, Teal is shown unexpectedly noticing a detail or uncovering a clue that more often than not hinders Templar's quest for \\"boodle\\" (loot), as in, for example, the story \\"The Unusual Ending\\" in The Brighter Buccaneer. Teal, however, is also shown acknowledging Templar's crimefighting and deduction abilities on numerous occasions. Although an attempt to make Templar an agent of Scotland Yard meets with failure (as seen in the novel She Was a Lady), Teal is often seen turning to Templar for advice and, occasionally, \\"off-book\\" assistance on a case. Templar, in return, willingly allows Teal to receive the credit (and, sometimes, the blame) when a case is resolved, though he is quick to berate Teal whenever he feels Teal is treating him unfairly and with undue suspicion. Teal disappears from the book series for a time after the 1939 short story collection The Happy Highwayman, as the Saint entered into a series of books set in America during World War II, reappearing after the war. In \\"The Talented Husband\\" (a short story in the 1956 collection The Saint Around the World) the Saint returns to the UK and indulges in one final round of 'Teal-baiting' before the Chief Inspector retires. Published more than a quarter century after Teal's literary debut, this was one of the few occasions in which Charteris acknowledged the passing of time in the Saint books, as he otherwise depicted Templar as an ageless hero. Teal is persuaded out of retirement in Le Saint contre les Cagoules Grises (one of the many French-language Saint novels published in the late 1950s‚Äì1960s and based upon one of the American comic strips) to help the Saint battle the Grey Hoods. Teal later returned in the 1975 collection Catch the Saint, which featured two novellas set prior to the Second World War. Teal was considered a major character by Charteris, so much so that he named a 1934 volume The Misfortunes of Mr. Teal. (Later editions of 1933's Once More the Saint were also retitled The Saint and Mr. Teal.) Film and TV portrayals Claud Eustace Teal has appeared in numerous film and TV adaptations of The Saint. Generally (though not always) dramatic depictions of Teal have presented him as a rather less competent policeman than in the novels, with his ponderous approach exaggerated at the expense of his detection abilities. In his most significant adaptation (the 1960s British television series) he is presented as almost incompetent, with his success in solving cases always down to the efforts of Simon Templar. When The Saint was first adapted for cinema by RKO Radio Pictures, five of the eight films in the RKO series were set in the United States. As a result, the character of Teal was usually replaced by Inspector Farnack, a New York detective of similar disposition who had been introduced in the novel The Saint in New York. Teal made his first RKO appearance in 1939's The Saint in London played by Gordon McLeod, and McLeod reprised the role in The Saint's Vacation (1941) and The Saint Meets the Tiger (1943). The Saint Meets the Tiger was based upon the aforementioned Meet ‚Äì The Tiger!, only this time Teal replaces the character of Detective Carn. In 1953 British Hammer Film Productions made The Saint's Return, which wasn't based on any of Charteris' stories. This film featured Charles Victor as Teal. On television, Ivor Dean played Teal as a recurring character in the 1962‚Äì69 British series, The Saint. Teal appeared in several early episodes played by other actors (Campbell Singer, Norman Pitt and Wensley Pithey respectively). Dean appeared in another role in Teal's second appearance (an episode entitled Starring the Saint) before being cast on a permanent basis. In the TV series Templar always greets Teal with mock respect: \\"Claud Eustace Teal, pride of Scotland Yard\\". Whilst Teal always gruffly refers to Templar by his surname only, Templar addresses Teal with the much more chummy \\"my dear Claud\\". The character did not appear in the spin-off, 1978's Return of the Saint, but did make a reappearance in the first episode of the 1989 series of TV movies starring Simon Dutton. On this occasion, he was played by David Ryall. The most recent appearance of the character has been in the 1997 film version of The Saint, played by Alun Armstrong.

The Dadu flows from the eastern Tibetan Plateau into the Sichuan Basin where it joins with the Min River, a tributary of the Yangtze River. Measured from its geographic source, the Dadu is actually longer than the Min and thus forms the main stem of the Min River system. Shuangjiangkou Dam, expected to be the tallest dam in the world, is being built on the Dadu River. Geography =Source= The Dadu River originates, in name, in Danba and ends in Leshan where it meets the Min River. The true source of Dadu, and thus the entire Min River system, however, lies in Qinghai Province in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. In this region there are multiple headwaters of the Dadu with nearly identical lengths that have resulted in competing claims as the true source of the Dadu. In 2013, the China Academy of Sciences announced they had located the geographic source of the Dadu in eastern Darlag County, Qinghai (). These headwaters () are a tributary of the Markog (), one of the two main upper stems of the Dadu along with the Darkog (). Traditionally, the source of the Dadu was considered to be in the Golog Mountains in Jigzhi County at the head of the Markog, but this source was found to be a few metres shorter than the true source. Similarly, the source of the Darkog in southern Darlag County is a mere shorter than the Ma'er Qu source. Hanyuan From the Dadu River's true source in Qinghai to the Min River's confluence with the Yangtze in Yibin, the length of the entire Min-Dadu River system is . =Course= The Dokog River in the west and the Markog River in the east both flow southeasterly from the Bayan Har Mountains in Qinghai and into Sichuan Province. The two stems meet in Aba Prefecture, and continue south as the Dajin Chuan (). Here, the river flows between the Daxue Mountains to the west and the Qionglai Mountains to the east. In Danba County, the Dajin Chuan meets the Xioajin Chuan () and together become the Dadu River in name. The Dadu continues south through Luding until it turns east at Shimian. East of Hanyuan, the Dadu enters the Dadu River Canyon () before reaching the lowlands of the Sichuan Basin just below Mount Emei. The Dadu River receives the Qingyu River tributary and meets the Min at Leshan. At the confluence of the Dadu with the Min, the Dadu possesses both greater water volume flow and a further source so it is considered the true course of the Min River system. From the confluence of the two rivers, the Min continues for another before meeting the Yangtze at Yibin. History Luding bridge The Dadu River marks the transition area between traditional Tibet to the west and historic China to the east. For this reason, it has long been considered a frontier region and has hosted many conflicts. For Tibetans, the Dadu is part of the historical province of Kham. In the Chinese tradition, the Dadu forms the westernmost part of Sichuanese culture. Kangding, a historical trading post between Tibet and China, is located in the Dadu River basin. Upper Dadu River Basin traditionally consists of 18 rGyalrong Principalities, whose language, rGyalrongic, is a distinct branch in the Tibeto-Burman language family. Completed in 803 CE, the Leshan Giant Buddha is a large statue carved into the rock at the confluence of the Dadu and Min Rivers. The Buddha is a popular tourist attraction today. The Kangding Louding earthquake of 1786 caused a landslide dam on the Dadu. Ten days later, on June 10 1786, the dam broke and the resulting flood extended downstream and killed 100,000 people. It is the second-deadliest landslide disaster on record.Schuster, R.L. and G. F. Wieczorek, \\"Landslide triggers and types\\" in Landslides: Proceedings of the First European Conference on Landslides, 2002, A. A. Balkema Publishers, p. 66 In the 20th century CE, the Dadu became famous for its Luding Bridge, a historically important bridge crossed by the Chinese Red Army while retreating from the Kuomintang troops during the Long March. =Dams= The Dadu is being heavily developed, primarily for hydroelectric power.

The United States Coast Survey Schooner Hassler was the first iron-hulled steamship used in the service of the U.S. Coast Survey. Ship history Plans for a new ship to chart the waters of U.S. Pacific Coast were drawn up in early 1870 by Carlile Patterson, the Hydrographic Inspector of the U.S. Coast Survey. Patterson called for an iron-hulled ship of about 325 tons, with a draft of no more than and a top speed of . He required that the ship used no more than 2¬Ω tons of coal per day, and could hold two months provisions for a crew of 37. The resulting ship was built in 1871 at the River Iron Works in Camden, New Jersey, under the supervision of John H. Dialogue. She was a three-masted schooner, equipped with a steeple compound engine, and cost $62,000 to build. In 1871-72 the ship sailed on the Hassler Expedition, under Commander Philip Carrigan Johnson, brother of the artist Eastman Johnson. This was the first important scientific expedition sent by the government for marine exploration. The expedition included Professor Louis Agassiz and his wife Elizabeth Agassiz; Mrs. Johnson; Dr. Franz Steindachner, ichthyologist; Dr. Thomas Hill, botanist; and Count L. F. de Pourtal√®s, J. A. Allen, and others. The steamer left Boston December 4, 1871, and reached San Francisco in August 1872. On the way to St. Thomas surface observations were made. Deep-sea dredging was done at Barbados and along the Brazilian coast. At the Straits of Magellan frequent stops were made, and at particularly interesting places several days were spent, and inland excursions undertaken, especially to examine glaciers. Throughout the route collections were made, with much of this material deposited in the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University. Some of the zoological results of the expedition were published by Agassiz, Lyman, and Pourtal√®s. After nearly 25 years in service, mostly around the Alaskan coast, the Hassler was finally decommissioned on May 25, 1895. In August 1897 she was sold to the McGuire Brothers for $15,700, and renamed Clara Nevada. She sailed from Seattle on January 26, 1898, with a crew of 40 men, bound for Skagway, Alaska with 165 passengers heading for the Klondike gold fields. Late on February 5, 1898, the Clara Nevada left Skagway with between 25 and 40 passengers aboard. During the night she struck an uncharted rock several hundred yards north of Eldred Rock and sank immediately. There were no survivors.

University of Chicago Press. / The Hindu shrines are miniature cosmic mountains based on plans in Indian religious texts, although Schoppert suggest the design motifs have little connection to India. \\"Tjandi Ardjoeno on the Dijeng Plateau\\" photo by Isidore van Kinsbergen In 2011, in a review published by Romain, the temple is now believed to be related to Dravida and Pallava style temples of South India. The theory that poisonous effusions make it auspicious is now disputed as volcanic activity in this area from 7th to 9th century is yet to established, and records suggest the temple was abandoned after volcanic eruptions became common in central Java. Geography and climate With an elevation of 2,060 m above sea level, Dieng has a distinct subtropical highland climate under the K√∂ppen climate classification (Cwb). In its brief dry season (which is meteorologically aligned with the Southern Hemispherical winter season), there is much less rainfall than in its lengthy monsoon periods (lasting from October to May, also in line with the austral summer). The average annual temperature in Dieng is 14.0 ¬∞C. About 2652 mm of precipitation falls annually. Known for its chilly climate, temperatures may even drop to 2 degrees (along with wind chills down to -2¬∫) in the peak of its dry season. Though infrequent, frosts have been recorded every year, particularly in late evenings and mornings of July and August. This may last for one week in average. Though this regionally-rare weather phenomena occasionally attracts tourists to cluster around the plateau area, it is also notorious for the destruction it often inflicts upon the local produce, with agricultural plants and crops such as potatoes being the most severely affected. Locals usually call this frost \\"bun upas\\". On the local Javanese dialect, \\"Bun\\" (or \\"embun\\") means dew, while \\"upas\\" is poison. Although \\"bun upas\\" or frost in Dieng is actually not poisonous, this term \\"upas\\" was created by local people due to its devastating effect on agricultural plants, in which, the plants die quickly as if as they were poisoned when the frost takes place.

DellaGrotte is the owner and operator of the Sityodtong USA Branch. He began his martial arts studies at an early age. His initial training involved classical martial arts, such as Tae Kwon Do, Shotokan Karate, and Tai-Chi. As his athleticism and martial skills grew, so did his desire to further his training in the martial arts. In 1992, his quest for a more combative martial art was complete when he met Guro Guy Chase, who had studied with some of the greatest martial artists of his time. Guro Chase had trained with Dan Inosanto, Ben Lagusa, Herman Suwanda, Ted Lucay, Salam Allsi, Surachai Sirisute and even Karl Gotch. At that point, Mark devoted himself entirely to the martial arts. Through this training he became certified in the arts of Jun Fan Jeet Kune Do, Indonesian Pencak Silat, Boxe Francaise Savate, Filipino Kali-Excrima, Submission wrestling and Muay Thai Kickboxing. DellaGrotte was first introduced to Muay Thai in 1997 when he was taken by a friend to the famed Yodtong boxing camp in Pattaya where he lived and trained. After proving his worth as a student and a fighter he was looked favorably upon by Kru Yodtong himself, a famous Muay Thai instructor who also takes in troubled youths. After eight years Kru Yodtong, as he‚Äôs known professionally, designated DellaGrotte as his representative in the United States to teach and preserve the art. In honor of his mentor, DellaGrotte named his gym Sityodtong, which means, \\"Student of Yodtong\\". Since he had taught martial arts prior to his fight career, he decided to step into the ring only to become a better trainer and teacher. So, he traveled throughout Thailand learning different styles of Muay Thai such as Mae Mai Muay Thai, Kun Khmer, Muay Boran, Muay Lao, and also Burmese Boxing. Contrary to general belief he has, by his own admission, less than 10 fights, most of which were held in Thailand. He says he has a winning record but admits a few losses one of which was to BOLTON UK Thai-boxer Nigel Green comfortably winning after three rounds in New York. The 30-year-old qualified instructor from Little Lever UK fought at the Big Apple's World Gym in Long Islandand, July 1999. Master Yodtong Senanan appointed Mark to teach, conserve and promote Thai style boxing worldwide. He is one of two of Kru Yodtong's US representatives and is honored to be an international conservator of Thai style boxing. Mark portrays himself as a striking coach to fictional character Scott Voss (played by Kevin James) in the 2012 sports comedy film Here Comes the Boom.

It is one of five ant-plant genera in the family Rubiaceae, the others being Anthorrhiza, Hydnophytum, Myrmephytum, and Squamellaria. Myrmecophytes, or ant plants, live in a mutualistic association with a colony of ants. These plants possess structural adaptations that provide ants with food and/or shelter. Myrmecodia are also classified as ephiphytes. The term epiphytic derives from the Greek epi- (meaning 'upon') and phyton (meaning 'plant'). Epiphytic plants are sometimes called \\"air plants\\" because they do not root in soil. An epiphyte is a plant that grows harmlessly upon another plant and derives its nutrition and water supply from the air and debris found in its immediate environment. Ephiphytes are a non- parasitic type of plant and differ from parasitic organisms in that this type of plant only relies on its host for physical support and does not necessarily have a negative effect on the host plant.  Structure and evolutionary adaptation  Amongst the array of Myrmecodia plants and myrmecolphilious epiphytes, a vast diversity exists with plants that all have similar evolutionary adaptions. Structures such as modified rhizomes, stems, and leaves, which have evolved to naturally produce systems of tunnels and caverns within its various modified organs. In the case of Rubiaceous tuberous antplants such as Myrmecodia plants, which rank highest in number and diversity among the antplants, all have very large, tuberous, modified stems containing many chambers. This adaptation is to house colonies of arboreal ants, which live within the readymade chambers naturally grown by the plant. The tuber begins its growth with the swelling of the seedling hypocotyl. Later, the cavities are formed when cork-generating meristems arise in the inner parenchymatous tissue forming a cork-like wall, cutting off carious shaped and sized enclosures. The contents of these then die and dry off, leaving the chambers empty. Future ant inhabitants may clean out remnants of dead tissue but do not primarily excavate‚Äîthis has been shown by the existence of chambers in plants to which ants never had access. It has been found that ants are not required for Myrmecodia to form the caudex, or tuberous inner chambers‚Äîthey exist naturally in Myrmecodia with or without a population of ants. Cavities are found to be randomly but normally distributed within tubers, with no observable pattern or structure. Cavities are connected to the outer surface of the plant by small holes, which are naturally occurring and not created by ants. Hollow, smooth-walled tunnels form within the caudex with external entrance holes, providing an above-ground home for ant colonies. These holes function both as ventilation for both the plant‚Äôs living tissues as well as the ants, and serve as passageways in and out of the plant.In illustration of the inner chambers of a Myrmecodia plantMyrmecodia species from the family Rubiaceae have the most highly specialized inner chambers, divided into smooth-walled chambers, which are used by ants for nurseries, and rough-walled chambers, used for waste disposal, insect prey remains, and bodies of dead ants from the colony. The caverns with smooth walls have no observable nutrition uptake ability through their walls. Rough-walled chambers, on the other hand, are able to absorb nutrients. In an experiment done with india ink and water, the mixture was placed in both smooth and rough-walled chambers. The mixture was absorbed readily through the protrusions in the rough-walled chamber, but even after sitting on the smooth- walled chamber surface for 20 hours, no absorption was observed. The protrusions that make the walls rough are inward facing modified root structures that make nutritional uptake through the plant‚Äôs rough-walled chambers possible. The cavities are also a measure of fitness‚Äîa plant with more cavity area means that it has a lighter tuber. This is advantageous because in most cases, although the plants are grown in situ, the tubers become too heavy and fall off of the tree they germinate on, eventually dying on the ground. This suggests that there is a strong selection against heavy or massive tubers. From the alveoli emerge small white flowers which can self- pollinate to yield a bright orange, fleshy berry filled with up to six small seeds. Seed dispersal is by birds, that often deposit droppings on the branches and trunks of trees they land on. In this they resemble various parasitic plants such as the mistletoes in families such as Loranthaceae, Santalaceae, and Misodendraceae, but Myrmecodia species are unrelated to the true parasites, being in the coffee and gardenia family Rubiaceae. Myrmecodia plants produce small, juicy fruits from their one or two leaves and flowers per plant. Seeds will be dispersed following the ingestion and passing of the seed as waste product by a bird, or more commonly, ants will remove the seeds from the fruit by chewing on the fruit. If a bird does get to the seed first, the ants will retrieve the seeds from the ground below, return the seeds to the nesting spot, and plant them on their substrate to continue growing their colony with more housing. The seeds are hardy‚Äîable to withstand passage through a gut, desiccation for multiple months, and germinate upon wetting.  Nutrients  Myrmecodia plants grow in tree branches and on trunks. In nature, Myrmecodia tubers often grow hanging downward on bare branches without significant amounts of substrate, and thus depend upon symbiosis for most nutriment. The plants store food and water in a greyish brown caudex that swells and grows spines over time. The thick, unbranched stems are covered in clypeoli and alveoli which also grow spines and are densely filled with dry bracts. Myrmecodia beccarii growing on Dischidia nummularia Fruits of Myrmecodia beccarii They form a symbiotic relationship with antsWilson, Edward O., The Insect Societies, Publisher: Belknap Press 1971, and fungi; Philidris cordata (formally Iridomyrmex cordatus) is believed to be the most common ant found occupying Myrmecodia species. Ant plants provide habitats for ant colonies high up into the forest canopy, protecting them from the elements, and in exchange, the nutrients from the ants and the debris left by the ants be absorbed in the plant's chambers. The plant in addition is protected, to some extent, from predation, especially by grazing invertebrates such as slugs. These plants also have a built in defense against climbing animals; even a slight tap or brush against the outside of an inhabited plant causes ants to come spilling out. Most species of ants that live within Myrmecodia species have no sting however, but the rush of ants combined with many small bites is enough to startle and warn any potential predator. The most important contribution the ants make to the plants they inhabit is not protection, but feeding the plant itself. The organic material that the ants contribute to the plant falls into three categories; nest building material (material such as leaves, bark, or other plant matter), ant-created products (such as waste, dead enemies, or the bodies of dead ants), and the final category is food that the ants themselves consume. All of these waste products stored within the rough-walled chambers begin to decompose when moisture is present, and are then broken down by microbial activity and the nutrients are then taken up by intrusive adventitious roots or absorbed through wall linings (rough-walls with root \\"bumps\\" lining the chambers). When scientists have examined the contents of the debris chambers, it appears as if the insect parts were placed in the chambers for their nutritional purpose to the plant. For example, disproportionately large numbers of ant heads, containing the most nutritionally dense parts of the ant, are found in large numbers within these chambers. This symbiosis allows the plants to effectively gather nutrients (via the ants) from a much larger area than the roots ever could cover. The ants operate as a mobile feeding system for the plant which act as an \\"auxiliary extensive, mobile root system for the plants\\" that bring it concentrated organic matter high in nutrients.

The medication is taken by mouth. Side effects of ethisterone include masculinization among others. Ethisterone is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It has some androgenic and anabolic activity and no other important hormonal activity. Ethisterone was discovered in 1938 and was introduced for medical use in Germany in 1939 and in the United States in 1945. It was the second progestogen to be marketed, following injected progesterone in 1934, and was both the first orally active progestogen and the first progestin to be introduced. Ethisterone was followed by the improved and much more widely used and known progestin norethisterone in 1957. Medical uses Ethisterone was used in the treatment of gynecological disorders such as irregular menstruation, amenorrhea, and premenstrual syndrome. =Available forms= Ethisterone was available in the form of 5, 10, and 25 mg oral and sublingual tablets, as well as 50 , 100 , and 250 mg oral capsules. The usual dosage was 25 mg, up to four times per day. Side effects Side effects of ethisterone reportedly include symptoms of masculinization such as acne and hirsutism among others. Findings are mixed on the anabolic effects of high doses of ethisterone. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Ethisterone has weak progestogenic activity and weak androgenic activity, but does not seem to have estrogenic activity. Ethisterone is a major active metabolite of danazol (2,3-isoxazolethisterone), and is thought to contribute importantly to its effects. Progestogenic activity Ethisterone is a progestogen, or an agonist of the progesterone receptors. It has about 44% of the affinity of progesterone for the progesterone receptor. The medication is described as a relatively weak progestogen, similarly to its analogue dimethisterone. Its total endometrial transformation dosage per 10 to 14 days in women is 200 to 700 mg. Ethisterone has about 20-fold lower potency as a progestogen relative to norethisterone. It is said to have minimal antigonadotropic effect and to not suppress ovulation, which has precluded its use in hormonal contraception. Androgenic activity Based on in vitro research, ethisterone and norethisterone are about equipotent in their values for activation of the androgen receptor (AR), whereas, conversely, norethisterone shows markedly increased potency relative to ethisterone in terms of its EC50 for the progesterone receptor. As such, there is a considerable separation in the ratios of androgenic and progestogenic activity for ethisterone and norethisterone. Moreover, at the larger dosages in which it is used to achieve equivalent progestogenic effect, ethisterone has more androgenic effect relative to norethisterone and other 19-nortestosterone progestins. However, the androgenic activity of ethisterone has in any case been described as weak. Due to its androgenic activity, ethisterone has been associated with the masculinization of female fetuses in women who have taken it during pregnancy. The 5Œ±-reduced metabolite of ethisterone, 5Œ±-dihydroethisterone, has been found to show reduced androgenic activity relative to ethisterone. Interestingly, ethisterone showed antiandrogenic activity when co-administered with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in animals, whereas 5Œ±-dihydroethisterone did not. Estrogenic activity Testosterone is aromatized into estradiol, and norethisterone, the 19-nortestosterone analogue of ethisterone, has similarly been shown to be aromatized into ethinylestradiol. In accordance, high doses of norethisterone have been found to be associated with marked increases in urinary estrogen excretion (due to metabolism into ethinylestradiol), as well as with high rates of estrogenic side effects such as breast enlargement in women and gynecomastia in men and improvement of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. In contrast, ethisterone and other progestogens such as progesterone and hydroxyprogesterone caproate do not increase estrogen excretion and are not associated with estrogenic effects, indicating that they have little or no estrogenic activity. Similarly, although ethisterone showed estrogenic effects in the uterus and vagina in rats, few or no such effects were observed in women treated with the medication, even at very high doses. As such, ethisterone does not appear to share the estrogenic activity of norethisterone, at least in humans. Aside from ethinylestradiol, 17Œ±-ethynyl-3Œ±-androstanediol and 17Œ±-ethynyl-3Œ≤-androstanediol may be estrogenic metabolites of ethisterone. =Pharmacokinetics= Absorption Ethisterone is active both orally and sublingually in humans. Good oral bioavailability of ethisterone has been observed in rats. The medication was the first orally active progestin to be discovered and introduced for clinical use. Distribution Ethisterone has relatively high affinity for sex hormone-binding globulin, about 14% of that of dihydrotestosterone and 49% of that of testosterone in one study. Metabolism In terms of metabolism, ethisterone is not converted into pregnanediol in humans. This indicates that it is not metabolized into progesterone. No aromatization of ethisterone has been detected in vivo, and no estrogenic metabolites were observed in vitro upon incubation of ethisterone in placental homogenates. This suggests that ethisterone may not be transformed into ethinylestradiol (17Œ±-ethynylestradiol). 5Œ±-Dihydroethisterone (5Œ±-dihydro-17Œ±-ethynyltestosterone), formed by 5Œ±-reductase, is an active metabolite of ethisterone. 17Œ±-Ethynyl-3Œ±-androstanediol and 17Œ±-ethynyl-3Œ≤-androstanediol, also formed via 5Œ±-reductase, as well as other enzymes, are also potential metabolites of ethisterone. Chemistry Ethisterone is a synthetic androstane steroid which was derived from testosterone and is also known by the following synonyms: * 17Œ±-Ethynyltestosterone (or simply ethinyltestosterone or ethynyltestosterone) * 17Œ±-Ethynylandrost-4-en-17Œ≤-ol-3-one * 17Œ±-Pregn-4-en-20-yn-17Œ≤-ol-3-one (or simply pregneninolone or pregnenynolone) * 20,21-Anhydro-17Œ≤-hydroxyprogesterone (or simply anhydrohydroxyprogesterone) Closely related analogues of ethisterone include dimethisterone (6Œ±,21-dimethylethisterone), norethisterone (19-norethisterone), and danazol (the 2,3-d-isoxazole ring-fused derivative of ethisterone), as well as vinyltestosterone, allyltestosterone, methyltestosterone, ethyltestosterone, and propyltestosterone. Other ethisterone analogues include ethinylandrostenediol (17Œ±-ethynyl-5-androstenediol), ethandrostate (17Œ±-ethynyl-5-androstenediol 3Œ≤-cyclohexylpropionate), 17Œ±-ethynyl-3Œ±-androstanediol, and 17Œ±-ethynyl-3Œ≤-androstanediol. =Synthesis= Chemical syntheses of ethisterone have been published. History Ethisterone was synthesized in 1938 by Hans Herloff Inhoffen, Willy Logemann, Walter Hohlweg, and Arthur Serini at Schering AG in Berlin. It was derived from testosterone via ethynylation at the C17Œ± position, and it was hoped, that, analogously to estradiol and ethinylestradiol, ethisterone would be an orally active form of testosterone. However, the androgenic activity of ethisterone was attenuated and it showed considerable progestogenic activity. As such, it was developed as a progestogen instead and was introduced for medical use in Germany in 1939 as Proluton C and by Schering in the United States in 1945 as Pranone. Ethisterone remained in use as late as 2000. Society and culture =Generic names= Ethisterone is the generic name of the drug and its , , and , while ethist√©rone is its . It has also been referred to as ethinyltestosterone, pregneninolone, and anhydrohydroxyprogesterone. =Brand names= Ethisterone has been marketed under a variety of brand names including Amenoren, Cycloestrol-AH Progest√©rone, Duosterone, Estormon, Etherone, Ethisteron, Luteosterone, Lutocyclin, Lutocylol, Lutogynestryl, Menstrogen, Nugestoral, Oophormin Luteum, Ora-Lutin, Orasecron, Pranone, Pre Ciclo, Prodroxan, Produxan, Progestab, Progesteron lingvalete, Progestoral, Proluton C, Syngestrotabs, and Trosinone among others. =Availability= Ethisterone was previously available in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, among other countries.

Jacoby graduated from Yale University in 1976, after which she became a staffer on the New York Review of Books. From 1981 to 1987 she served as a deputy editor of the op-ed page of The New York Times, and from 1987 to 1989 as a senior writer and justice editor at Newsweek. She has also been assistant to the editor at the New York Review of Books. Her writing with regard to race relations and immigration has been published in numerous publications, including Commentary, Dissent, The Nation, The New Republic, The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, and the New York Times Book Review, among other journals of political thought and newspapers of national or regional scope. Her 1998 book, Someone Else‚Äôs House: America‚Äôs Unfinished Struggle for Integration (Basic Books), tells the story of race relations in three American cities‚ÄîNew York, Detroit and Atlanta. More recently, Jacoby's career has been marked by an outspoken advocacy for policies that would liberalize America's immigration laws-which she believes is an essential policy shift in order to maintain the economic growth of the United States while preventing a brain drain to other nations-specifically, the passage of a broad guest worker program, which some critics have described as an amnesty proposal. To this end, she has repeatedly praised President Bush's guest-worker legalization plan and engaged in numerous debates with critics of legalization such as Mark Krikorian\\"Debates: Tamar Jacoby v. Mark Krikorian\\" on Immigrants and the War on Terror, National Review, February 14, 2003 10:00 a.m. and John O' Sullivan. In 2004, Basic Books published an anthology edited by Jacoby, Reinventing the Melting Pot: The New Immigrants and What It Means To Be American, which expands upon these views, and gathers a diverse array of writers who advocate some form of absorption and assimilation of recent immigrants. The same year, she was confirmed by the United States Senate to a seat on the National Council on the Humanities, the advisory board to the National Endowment for the Humanities.

The technique induces oversteer using weight transfer to carry a vehicle through a turn while simultaneously reducing speed. Origin of the name Beginning in the 1960s, Scandinavian rally-car drivers popularized the technique. The \\"flick\\" part comes from the technique of \\"flicking\\" the wheel in a direction opposite of the turn to build up angular momentum. Technique Scandinavian flick mechanics Approaching along the inside of an upcoming turn, the driver steers sharply towards the outside of the turn, then lifts off the throttle and lightly applies the brakes. This causes weight transfer that rotates the car toward the outside of the turn. Then, steering into the turn and releasing the brake pedal while applying full throttle will cause the car to rotate into the corner. Towards the corner exit, the driver may countersteer to control the oversteer. When properly executed this technique neatly lines the car up for the exit while maintaining momentum. Contemporary usage Since the 1990s, most cars produced have been front-wheel drive which are prone to understeer. This makes a vehicle stable at high speed but requires larger steering inputs near the limits of adhesion, especially on low-grip surfaces. Skilled drivers are able to use a maneuver similar to the Scandinavian flick, though with less steering input and control the possible slide by using opposite lock. The ability of a vehicle to handle sudden changes in direction at high speeds without sliding or rolling over is assessed through the so- called moose test. This scenario occurs when the driver is trying to avoid an obstacle (ostensibly a moose, or any other large animal that may appear on the road) in his or her lane and then returning to the lane to avoid oncoming traffic. The succession of sharp turns in opposite directions combined with lifting off the throttle is exactly how the Scandinavian flick is performed. Since the technique is used at race speeds, it's not normal for a vehicle to start a slide while driving at road speeds. This technique is commonly used in ice-racing in North America and Europe (e.g. the Andros Trophy). On loose surfaces, contemporary rally drivers tend to rely more on left-foot braking for directional control in cornering FWD cars. =Official usage= This technique is taught by some countries in the Scandinavian/Nordic regions during basic driver training. It may also be taught in the UK for professional drivers (e.g. police, emergency medical response, military) who may be required to drive on snow tires in ice/snow conditions, as a vehicle can behave differently and require different driver skills in winter conditions. Cultural references It is frequently used by former racing driver Tiff Needell on the motoring programme Fifth Gear and previously during his time as a presenter on the television show Top Gear. It was also used in Clarkson-era Top Gear, in which Richard Hammond tried to achieve the Scandinavian flick whilst cornering in his \\"lightweight, mid-engined\\" Suzuki Super Carry. The result was a less than spectacular roll-over to its side. Additionally, it is featured on Top Gear in an episode in which James May hones his rally skills with Mika H√§kkinen in the woods and snowy landscape of Finland.

It was written by Ira Steven Behr and Hans Beimler, and directed by Chip Chalmers. The title is a reference to the film The Magnificent Seven, and the episode makes several minor homages to the film. In the episode, Quark and Rom's mother is taken captive by the Dominion and so they put together a team of Ferengi to rescue her.Star Trek 101: A Practical Guide to Who, What, Where, and Why By Terry J. Erdmann (Page 151) The episode was lighter in tone compared to the typical gritty war episodes of the series at the time. It featured Iggy Pop as a guest star, and Jeffrey Combs in a recurring role. Plot Quark learns from the Ferengi leader Grand Nagus Zek that his mother, Ishka (who is also Zek's lover), has been captured by the Dominion. Zek offers a reward of 50 bars of latinum for her rescue. Quark and his brother Rom decide to assemble an all-Ferengi commando team to rescue her, claiming that the reward is 20 bars so they can keep a larger share. They first recruit Rom's son Nog, making him \\"Strategic Operations Officer\\" for the mission. Next, they hire Leck, a Ferengi \\"eliminator\\", tempting him with the challenge of fighting the Dominion's Jem'Hadar soldiers. Quark bails out his cousin Gaila, who has been arrested for vagrancy, and signs him up as a chance for redemption. Disgraced ex-Liquidator Brunt, hoping to win Zek's favor, persuades them to add him to the team for the use of his ship. In battle-training simulations, the Ferengi prove to be poor commandos; one simulation ends with Leck killing Ishka. Quark and Rom realize that although Ferengi may not be good commandos, they are excellent negotiators; instead of attacking the Dominion, they propose a prisoner exchange to win Ishka's freedom. Major Kira and Captain Sisko give Quark custody of Keevan, the Vorta captured in the episode Rocks and Shoals, and Quark arranges a meeting with the Dominion at the abandoned space station Empok Nor. The team makes base camp in Empok Nor's infirmary. The Dominion's negotiator, a Vorta named Yelgrun, arrives with Ishka in custody, guarded by a squad of Jem'Hadar. Quark offers his terms, to which Yelgrum agrees: all but two Jem'Hadar must leave the station before the prisoner exchange takes place. While celebrating their soon-to-be-successful exchange, Rom accidentally lets slip that the reward is actually 50 bars, not 20. In a rage, Gaila tries to shoot Quark but ends up killing Keevan. Quark persuades the team not to give up, offering equal shares of the 50 bars. Nog discovers some working neural stimulators in the abandoned infirmary, which enables him to move Keevan's body by remote control. At the prisoner exchange, they are able to get Keevan's dead body to walk; Yelgrun does not realize he is dead until after Ishka is safely with Quark, when Keevan walks into a bulkhead. The Ferengi ambush the two Jem'Hadar guards and capture Yelgrun; as they leave Empok Nor, Keevan's body continues walking into the bulkhead.

He belonged to the E√≥ganacht Glendamnach sept of the dominant E√≥ganachta kin-group whose members dominated Munster from the 7th century to the 10th. His father, uncle, grandfather, and great-grandfather had also been kings of Cashel, so too were his son and grandson. Cathal's conflict with the U√≠ N√©ill kings, Fergal mac M√°ele D√∫in, Flaithbertach mac Loingsig, and √Åed All√°n, son of Fergal mac M√°ele D√∫in, is reported at some length in the Irish annals, and again northern and southern versions provide differing accounts. Cathal also appears as a character, not always portrayed sympathetically as in Aislinge Meic Con Glinne where he is possessed by a demon of gluttony, in a number of prose and verse tales in the Middle Irish language. Widely regarded as the most powerful Irish king of the first half of the 8th century, and the strongest (historical) king from Munster before Brian B√≥ruma,Mac Shamhr√°in 2005 Cathal mac Finguine is believed to be the last king mentioned in the Baile Chuinn Ch√©tchathaig.Mac Shamhr√°in and Byrne 2005, pp. 210‚Äì12 The most expansionist historical E√≥ganacht king before him was Fa√≠lbe Flann mac √Åedo Duib (d. 639). Background Map showing the major kingdoms and regions of early Christian Ireland.After Duffy, p. 17, and Byrne, pp. 172‚Äì173. The E√≥ganachta kingship, which had its chief seat at Cashel and chief church at Emly, was the most powerful in the southern half of Ireland, while the various branches of the U√≠ N√©ill and Connachta dominated the northern half. At this time, the U√≠ N√©ill were striving to be the sole Kings of Tara, with the succession generally alternating between the northern and southern branches of the U√≠ N√©ill,The presumed expansion of the E√≥ganachta and U√≠ N√©ill is shown in Duffy, pp. 18‚Äì19. For the U√≠ N√©ill king lists and genealogies, see Byrne, pp. 275‚Äì277 & 280‚Äì284; Charles-Edwards, chapter 12 & pp. 600‚Äì608. although the ancient ceremonial kingship had not long before been held by the Laigin and Ulaid, and more distantly the D√°irine and √ârainn. The kingship of Cashel, argued in early Munster sources, e.g., the Uraicecht Becc,D. A. Binchy, \\"The Date and Provenance of Uraicecht Becc\\", in √âriu 18 (1958): 44‚Äì54. as actually the most powerful in Ireland, was founded in the middle of the 5th century by the descendants of Conall Corc and Aimend, the \\"inner circle\\" of the E√≥ganachta, who after a century and a half of able politicking had come to supersede the overlordship of the Corcu Lo√≠gde in Munster. For the century and a quarter until Cathal's death, the kingship of Cashel was dominated by the E√≥ganacht Chaisil and E√≥ganacht Glendamnach septs of the inner circle.For king lists and genealogies, see Byrne, pp. 277‚Äì279 & 291‚Äì296; Charles-Edwards, pp. 612‚Äì617. The lands of the Glendamnach lay to the south-west of Cashel, in the middle valley of the Blackwater.Byrne, pp. 172‚Äì173. Cathal's father, Finguine mac Cathail Con-cen-m√°thair (d. 696), uncle, Ailill mac Cathail (d. 701), grandfather, Cathal C√∫-cen-m√°thair (d. 665/666), and great-grandfather, Cathal mac √Åedo (d. 628), had been kings of Cashel. Cathal's immediate predecessor was probably Cormac mac Ailello of the Caisil sept, who was killed in battle against the D√©isi in 713. Etersc√©l mac M√°ele Umai, who had been king and did not die until 721, had probably abdicated much earlier, so that Cathal was king at Cashel from around 713 onwards.Irwin. For the death of Cormac at the battle of Cam Feradaig, Annals of Innisfallen, s.a. 713, and Annals of Ulster, s.a. 713; for the death of Etersc√©l, Annals of Innisfallen, s.a. 721. While the U√≠ N√©ill and E√≥ganachta were the most important kingships in Ireland, the kings of Leinster and the kings of Connacht were significant forces. Leinster, once a much larger region, the northern parts of which had been conquered by the U√≠ N√©ill, was the target of expansionist U√≠ N√©ill kings, and also of the E√≥ganachta. The contest for control of Leinster would play a major part in Cathal's reign, and indeed in relations between the E√≥ganachta and U√≠ N√©ill in the centuries which followed. The kings of Connacht claimed a common kinship with the U√≠ N√©ill, and were largely favourable towards them. The remaining provincial kingship, that of the kings of Ulster, controlled a much smaller area than the later province of Ulster, largely confined to the lands north and east of Lough Neagh, and was generally hostile to the U√≠ N√©ill.Byrne, pp. 126‚Äì129. Finally, in the vast province of Munster itself there were several respectable but peripheral dynasties, such as the U√≠ Liath√°in (for whom see below), whose relationships with the E√≥ganachta were rather distant and ambiguous. Early reign The earliest record concerning Cathal, although it does not explicitly name him, is in 715 when Murchad mac Brain Mut of the U√≠ D√∫nlainge, the king of Leinster, led his inaugural raid against Cashel.Irwin; the Annals of Ulster, s.a. 715, record a \\"hosting by Murchad son of Bran to Cashel\\". The inaugural raid by a new king was a long-standing tradition in Gaelic society; √ì Cr√≥in√≠n, p. 99. The first event to mention Cathal is in 721 when he and Murchad mac Brain attacked the lands of the southern U√≠ N√©ill. The Annals of Ulster report: \\"[t]he wasting of Mag Breg by Cathal son of Finnguine, and by Murchad son of Bran.\\"Annals of Ulster, s.a. 721. Later that year, Fergal mac M√°ele D√∫in retaliated, not against Cathal and Munster, but against Murchad and Leinster. The Annals of Ulster report: \\"An invasion of the Laigin by Fergal, and the cattletribute was imposed and the hostages of the Laigin secured for Fergal son of Mael D√∫in.\\" That Fergal attacked Leinster in retaliation for the raid on Brega may mean that Cathal was, as Irwin notes, \\"the junior partner\\".Irwin. The Annals of Inisfallen, as partisan a southern record as the Annals of Ulster are biased towards the U√≠ N√©ill, give a different and less reliable report of the events in 721: > The harrying of Brega by Cathal son of Finnguine, king of Mumu, and after > that he and Ferga son of Mael D√∫in, king of Temuir [Tara], made peace; and > Ferga submitted to Cathal. For these were the five kings of the Munstermen > who ruled Ireland after the [introduction of the] Faith, viz. Aengus son of > Nad Fra√≠ch, and his son, i.e. Eochaid who ruled Ireland for seventeen years, > and Cathal, son of Finnguine, and Feidlimid, son of Crimthann, and Brian, > son of Cenn√©tig.Annals of Innisfallen, s.a. 721; Irwin notes that this is an > 11th-century entry and \\"an artificial promotion of a favoured character\\". Fergal led an U√≠ N√©ill army south into Leinster again in 722, but this time he was defeated and killed by the Leinstermen. This defeat was recorded in the Cath Almaine, a poem about the battle of Allen, fought on 11 December 722, the feast of Saint Finnian of Clonard. Much of the work is devoted to the story of the faithful bard Donn B√≥, but the introduction provides a late view of the war: > For a long time there was great warfare between Cathal son of Findguine, > king of Leth Mogha, and Fergal son of M√°el Duin, king of Leth Cuinn. Fergal > son of Mael Duin raided Leinster in order to injure Cathal son of Findguine; > so Cathal son of Findguine wasted the whole of Magh Bregh [the plain of > Brega], until they made peace and truce.Stokes trans. from the Yellow Book > of Lecan. This truce, the poet tells, was broken by the Leinstermen: > The Leinstermen had delivered this battle of Allen in the absence of Cathal > mac Finguini, and Cathal was grieved that the battle was fought while he > himself was away. They heard of Cathal's grudge against them, so this was > the counsel they framed, to carry to Cathal Fergal's head as a trophy of the > action.Stokes trans. from the Yellow Book of Lecan. Cathal and Flaithbertach mac Loingsig On the death of Fergal, the U√≠ N√©ill kingship of Tara passed to Fogartach mac N√©ill of the S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine of South Brega, whose nominal High Kingship was ended in 724 when he was killed fighting against his S√≠l n√Åedo Sl√°ine kinsman Cin√°ed mac √çrgalaid of North Brega, who became the new overking of the U√≠ N√©ill.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 724. Cin√°ed retained the overlordship of the U√≠ N√©ill for less than four years, being killed in battle at Druim Corcain against the Cen√©l Conaill king Flaithbertach mac Loingsig, who took the overlordship of the U√≠ N√©ill.Annals of Ulster, 728. Flaithbertach himself reigned for only a few years before √Åed All√°n of the Cen√©l nE√≥gain, son of Fergal mac M√°ele D√∫in, fought him for the leadership of the U√≠ N√©ill, beginning in 732 and continuing through several battles until Flaithbertach abdicated and entered a monastery in 734.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 732, 733, 734; Byrne, p. 114. With the U√≠ N√©ill kings no great threat during the reigns of Fogartach, Cin√°ed and Flaithbertach, Cathal sought to extend his authority over Leinster. The Cath Almaine claims that the dispute arose because Fergal mac M√°ele D√∫in had been killed in defiance of the truce he had made with Cathal. Cathal was defeated by √Åed mac Colggen of the U√≠ Cheinnselaig, then King of Leinster, in 731,Annals of Ulster, s.a. 731. and a second battle in 735 was an even greater defeat: > A battle between Mumu and Laigin, in which many of the Laigin and well nigh > countless Munstermen perished; Cellach son of Faelchar, king of Osraige, > fell therein, but Cathal son of Finnguine, king of Mumu, escaped.Thus the > Annals of Ulster, s.a. 735, but the Annals of Innisfallen, s.a. 735, make > Cathal the victor. Irwin prefers the account in the Annals of Ulster. In 733 Cathal raided the lands of the Southern U√≠ N√©ill, but was defeated and driven off from Tailtiu by Domnall Midi of Clann Cholm√°in. Cathal had more success against the neighbouring Clann Cholm√°in Bicc, ruled by Fallomon mac Con Congalt, whom he defeated at the Hill of Ward. In 734 Cathal inflicted a defeat on the Leinstermen at Bealach Ele.Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 730 (for 734). Cathal and √Åed All√°n In 737, √Åed All√°n met with Cathal at Terryglass, probably neutral ground outwith the control of either king. Byrne says that it is unlikely that Cathal acknowledged √Åed All√°n's authority‚Äîthe U√≠ N√©ill had little enough influence in the south‚Äîbut if Cathal had expected some benefit from the meeting, where he perhaps acknowledged the ecclesiastical supremacy of Armagh, he was to be disappointed. However, the clerics of Armagh may have been well satisfied as the Annals of Ulster, in the entry following that which reports the meeting of Cathal and √Åed All√°n, say that the law of Patrick was in force in Ireland. This presumably means that they agreed to the special treatment of the church, its lands and its tenants, as prescribed by the law of Patrick. M√≥r Muman Of M√≥r Muman a legend survives which compares her to the goddess of sovereignty. M√≥r was placed under an enchantment and lost her senses. She wandered Ireland for two years before she came to Cashel and the court of Fingen. Fingen eventually slept with her, and her memory returned. In the morning, Fingen gave her the Queen's robe and brooch, and put aside his current Queen, daughter of the king of the Deisi, and put M√≥r in her place as she was of better blood. The Metrical Dindshenchas say of Fingen mac √Åedo and M√≥r: > Best of the women of Inis Fail > is M√≥r daughter of √Åed Bennan. > Better is Fingen than any hero > that drives about Femen.Metrical Dindshenchas, volume 3, p. 203. When Fingen died, the story says, M√≥r Muman married Cathal mac Finguine. Unfortunately, the collector of this tale mistook this Cathal for his grandfather, Cathal mac √Åedo Flaind. He may have married M√≥r Muman, but Cathal mac Finguine certainly did not.Byrne, pp.204‚Äì207. Family and descendants The historical wife of Cathal was the celebrated Caillech, a princess of the U√≠ Liath√°in, southern neighbours of E√≥ganacht Glendamnach.Connon, p. 320Mac Shamhr√°in, p. 69 His mother, Gormgel, also appears to have been of the U√≠ Liath√°in, but from a different branch.Connon, p. 319 Cathal's father was Finguine mac Cathail, uncle Ailill mac Cathail, grandfather Cathal C√∫-cen- m√°thair, and great-grandfather Cathal mac √Åedo. A son was Artr√≠ mac Cathail, and a grandson Tn√∫thgal mac Artrach. With the exception of the last, all are reliably mentioned as kings of Cashel in the annals. His living direct descendants, the later ruling dynasty of E√≥ganacht Glendamnach, descendants of Art Caemh, a great-grandson of Artr√≠ mac Cathail, are the √ì Caiomh (O'Keeffes) of County Cork. His daughter, Taileflaith, also has prominent 21st-century descendants. Notes References * Bhreathnach, Edel (ed.), The Kingship and Landscape of Tara.

It is located 1 km north of the city centre after Lavov most, on Marie Louise Boulevard in the immediate proximity of the Central Bus Station Sofia. It was completely renovated in 2016. History The original building of the Sofia Railway Station was opened on 1 August 1888 to serve the Tsaribrod-Sofia-Vakarel line, the first line of the Bulgarian State Railways entirely built by Bulgarian engineers. The building was designed by the architects Anton√≠n Kol√°≈ô, V√°clav Pro≈°ek and Marinov, and built with the participation of Italian specialists under Bulgarian undertaker Ivan Grozev between 1882 and 1888. It was a one-storey building, 96 m long and 12 m wide, featuring a small clock tower looking towards Vitosha on the fa√ßade and a second storey in the western and eastern part. The first station master was Yosif Karapirov. The Sofia Railway Station was renovated and expanded several times. When the Poduyane railway station was constructed in 1948, the Sofia Railway Station was renamed the Central Railway Station. The old building was completely demolished on 15 April 1974, as the construction of a new Brutalist Central Railway Station had begun in 1971. The station was opened on 6 September 1974, having been designed by the Transproekt company under lead architect Milko Bechev. It has two underground and three overground storeys and 365 premises and was built of mainly white marble. Between January and July 2004 the Central Railway Station in Sofia had served 2,323,844 passengers, or 11.8% of all in the country's railway network for that period. An average 10,910 people pass through the station daily, as well as an average 166 trains (84 arriving and 82 departing). The station has 30 ticket offices and 5 electronic timetable displays.

Under his command, the Qin army conquered the states of Zhao, Yan, and Chu. He is considered one of the four greatest generals of the Warring States period, along with Bai Qi, Lian Po and Li Mu. Wang was born in Dongxiang, Pinyang, Guanzhong (north-east of modern Fuping County, Shaanxi province). His son, Wang Ben (), was also a Qin general.  Early life  In 236 BC, Wang Jian commanded the Qin army which attacked Zhao and captured nine cities. This action represented the start of King of Qin, Ying Zheng's wars of unification. The Kingdom of Zhao ceased to exist in 228 BC after Wang Jian used spies in the Zhao court to have Zhao's leading general Li Mu replaced and then he captured Zhao's king. According to the Grand Historian, after Jing Ke failed in his attempt to assassinate emperor Qin Shi Huang, the Kingdom of Yan where Jing Ke was a retainer, was conquered by General Wang Jian in 226 BC. A year later, Wang Jian's son Wang Ben conquered the Kingdom of Wei. Conquest of Chu, 225‚Äì223 BC In 225 BC, only two kingdoms (states) remained independent: Chu and Qi. Chu had recovered significantly enough to mount serious resistance after their disastrous defeats to Qin in 278 BC and losing their centuries-old capital of Ying (Jingzhou). Despite its territorial size, resources and manpower, Chu's fatal flaw was its largely corrupt government that mostly overturned the legalistic-style reforms of Wu Qi from a century and a half earlier, when Wu Qi transformed Chu into the most powerful state with an area of almost half of all the other states combined. Wu Qi was from the same state (Wei) as Shang Yang, whose legalistic reforms turned Qin into an invincible war machine. The King of Qin, Ying Zheng, decided to finally defeat the remnants of the Chu state located in Huaiyang. According to Shiji's chapter on the great generals of the Warring States, Ying Zheng had first requested his general Wang Jian to lead the invasion, and further inquired as to the military strength needed for the siege. Wang Jian stated that he needed a force of 600,000 men for the invasion. However, when the same question was posed to Li Xin, he requested only 200,000 men. Ying Zheng accepted Li Xin's advice. Wang Jian retired, claiming ill health. The first Qin invasion was a disaster when the 200,000 Qin troops were defeated by 500,000 Chu troops in the unfamiliar territory of Huaiyang (modern-day northern Jiangsu and Anhui provinces). Ying Zheng recalled Wang Jian, who finally agreed to lead the second invasion force after being allocated the force of 600,000 men that he had earlier requested. In 224 BC, Wang Jian began the second invasion by Qin forces of Chu. Chu's morale had greatly increased after their success the previous year. The Chu forces were content to wait and defend their territory. Wang Jian tricked the Chu army by appearing inactive within his fortifications while secretly training his troops to fight in Chu territory. After a year, Chu decided to disband most of their army due to the lack of action. Wang Jian then invaded and overran Huaiyang and the remaining Chu forces. Xiang Yan, the Chu general, managed to resist and inflict bloody losses on Wang Jian until King Fuchu of Chu was killed by Wang Jian's second in command, Meng Wu, father of Meng Tian. Chu was finally conquered by Qin in 223 BC. At their peak, the armies of Chu and Qin combined numbered over 1,000,000 troops, more than the massive campaign at Changping between Qin and Zhao 35 years earlier. The excavated personal letters of two Qin regular soldiers, Hei Fu () and Jin (), records a protracted campaign in Huaiyang under general Wang Jian. Both soldiers wrote letters requesting supplies (clothing) and money from home to sustain the long campaign. Cultural reference In Manga and Anime Kingdom where he is known as Ousen, he was described as a silent tactician. His army can construct defenses quickly, can think while scouting the terrain and decide who is who.

It is located on the northern slope of the Greater Caucasus mountains, in the historical Georgian province of Upper Khevsureti, which is now part of the modern-day region (mkhare) of Mtskheta-Mtianeti. As of 2014 census, population of the village was 22. Geography Located in the deep Arghuni gorge at approximate 1,400 meters, the village is actually a unique complex of medieval-to-early modern fortresses and fortified dwellings of stone and mortar which functioned both as a residential area and a fortress guarding the northeastern outskirts of the country. The fortress consists of the terraced structures dominated by flat-roofed dwellings and some 60 towers which cluster together to create a single chain of fortifications. History and current status Shatili was once part of the Kingdom of Kakheti. The population of Shatili, along with that of most of the Khevsureti, was resettled under the pressure from the Soviet authorities to the plains in the early 1950s Citation needed. In the 1960s, the exotic landscape of the empty village was used as a setting for a series of Georgian films about the past life of the highlanders.Bruce Grant & Lale Yal√ßƒ±n-Heckmann (ed., 2008), Caucasus Paradigms: Anthropologies, Histories, and the Making of a World Area, pp. 23-24.

It was entered into the 1983 Cannes Film Festival. Although it immediately followed Beineix's big, commercial success Diva and featured two very big stars, G√©rard Depardieu and Nastassja Kinski, The Moon in the Gutter was not well received by critics or audiences and failed at the box office with only 625,000 admissions in France.http://www.jpbox- office.com/fichfilm.php?id=6888 Its vivid visual style was noted by critics. It preceded a much better-appreciated cult success from the same director, known in the US and UK as Betty Blue. The film was based on a pulp-noir novel of the same name, written by David Goodis, but it was transferred in the film script from the docksides of Philadelphia to Marseille. La Lune dans le caniveau, according to AllMovie, \\"received uneven reviews on its initial release\\". It won a French Cesar Award for its production design. Synopsis Two women: Loretta (Nastassja Kinski), a wealthy amateur photographer who prowls the docks in her early '60s Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder looking for handsome men, and Bella (Victoria Abril), a poor but beautiful woman who is probably a prostitute, share affections for a dock worker named Gerard (played by G√©rard Depardieu). He is obsessed by the memory of his sister, who was raped and then committed suicide in a back alley, which he visits every night. No one knows who committed the rape, and he has sworn to avenge the crime, if he can only figure out who the perpetrator was. Reception Although the movie was a failure when first released, it had a number of cult admirers. In the mid-1980s it was often screened as a fashionable late night art movie for esoteric clubs such as the Edinburgh Academy Cinema Society. In the American DVD release director Jean-Jacques Beineix reveals that after the expanded 3 hour DVD version director's cut of Betty Blue was released he approached Gaumont, the studio that produced the film, about doing the same with The Moon in the Gutter. A studio executive later notified him sadly that such an extended release recut was not possible in this case. It was revealed that Gaumont had felt the film was so poorly received initially that all of the extra footage and doubles were destroyed to make space in the film vaults. The excuse was that accountants had reasoned that the film was a financial liability with little future value that had severely damaged Gaumont's reputation. Such an action is said to be extremely rare in the film industry since the cost of storing film footage is rather minimal after production has ended. Beineix added that the film had originally been cut into a 4 hour version and a 3 hour version as well and that both lost versions expanded on the main characters and more fully exposed and explained the story's main premise. The loss reportedly still haunts Beineix today.

After initially losing control of most of Hu·∫ø and its surroundings, the combined South Vietnamese and American forces gradually recaptured the city over one month of intense fighting. The battle was one of the longest and bloodiest of the war, and the battle negatively affected American public perception of the war. By the beginning of the North Vietnamese Tet Offensive on 30 January 1968, which coincided with the Vietnamese T·∫øt Lunar New Year, large conventional American forces had been committed to combat operations on Vietnamese soil for almost three years. Highway 1, passing through the city of Hu·∫ø, was an important supply line for Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) and United States forces from the coastal city of Da Nang to the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), the de facto border between North and South Vietnam only to the north of Hu·∫ø. It also provided access to the Perfume River (Vietnamese: S√¥ng H∆∞∆°ng or H∆∞∆°ng Giang) at the point where the river ran through Hu·∫ø, dividing the city into northern and southern parts. Hu·∫ø was also a base for United States Navy supply boats. Due to the T·∫øt holidays, large numbers of ARVN forces were on leave and the city was poorly defended. While the ARVN 1st Division had cancelled all T·∫øt leave and was attempting to recall its troops, the South Vietnamese and American forces in the city were unprepared when the Vi·ªát C·ªông (VC) and the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) launched the Tet Offensive, attacking hundreds of military targets and population centers across the country, including Hu·∫ø. The PAVN-VC forces rapidly occupied most of the city. Over the next month, they were gradually driven out during intense house-to- house fighting led by the Marines and ARVN. In the end, although the Allies declared a military victory, the city of Hu·∫ø was virtually destroyed, and more than 5,000 civilians were killed (2,800 of them executed by the PAVN and VC), while South Vietnamese forces killed a further 1,000‚Äì2,000 people after the battle. The PAVN-VC lost an estimated 5,133 killed, while Allied forces lost 668 dead and 3,707 wounded. Planning Hu·∫ø, the ancient imperial capital city of Vietnam, had a population of nearly 140,000, making it the third largest city in the Republic of Vietnam, commonly known as South Vietnam. The Citadel, or Imperial City, is the walled-in portion of Hu·∫ø sitting on the north bank of the Perfume River. The walls of the Citadel form a square with sides of 2,500 meters. The outer stone wall is one meter thick, five meters high and is separated from the inner wall by dirt fill. The distance between the walls varies from 75 meters to 17.5 meters. Half the population lived within the Citadel in 1 or 2 story houses surrounded by stone walls. On the south side of the river was the new city of Hu·∫ø, which contained most of the government buildings, schools, and the university, set on wide boulevards. Connecting the Citadel and new city were the Tr∆∞·ªùng Ti·ªÅn Bridge (), which carried Highway 1, and further west the Bach Ho rail bridge. Hu·∫ø had great symbolism, having been the capital of Vietnam under the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty from 1802 to 1945. Ho Chi Minh, Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªìng, V√µ Nguy√™n Gi√°p and Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám had all attended the lyc√©e in the city. Hu·∫ø had been at the center of the Buddhist crisis of 1963 and the Buddhist Uprising of 1966 and other than the city's Catholics, its population of Buddhists and intellectuals were lukewarm supporters of the Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu-Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥ government. The North Vietnamese plan for the Tet Offensive was known as the \\"General Offensive- General Uprising\\". The General Offensive was to comprise conventional and guerilla military action aimed primarily at the \\"puppet\\" South Vietnamese military and government, attempting to destroy their legitimacy among the South Vietnamese population. The General Uprising was the expectation that the oppressed South Vietnamese population would then spontaneously rise up and overthrow the Thi·ªáu-K·ª≥ government and that this would force the United States to withdraw in the face of the will of the people. The strategic objective at Hu·∫ø was to capture (or \\"liberate\\") and hold the city, leading to the establishment of a revolutionary government. While some senior PAVN leaders were skeptical about the plan, believing that the population was unlikely to rise up and that they could only hold out against the ARVN and U.S. forces for a few days before they would be forced to withdraw, they followed their orders. Younger soldiers were convinced by the party propaganda that they were on the verge of a great victory that would end the war. When the PAVN and VC forces left their base camps west of Hu·∫ø to commence the attack they had no intention of returning. The ARVN and Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) were largely unprepared for the Tet Offensive. MACV's focus was on the Battle of Khe Sanh, where a PAVN assault was believed to be imminent. In preparation for this, MACV was in the middle of Operation Checkers: moving the 1st Marine Division to Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province in order to support Khe Sanh and defeat any other PAVN attack across the DMZ. Opposing forces =South Vietnam= The headquarters of ARVN Brigadier general Ng√¥ Quang Tr∆∞·ªüng's 1st Division was located in the Mang Ca Garrison, a minifortress in the northeast corner of the Citadel. Apart from the headquarters staff and a handful of support units, the only combat units in the Citadel were the division‚Äôs 36-man Reconnaissance Platoon and its reaction force, the elite Hac Bao (Black Panther) Reconnaissance Company. southwest of the Citadel, on the north bank of the Perfume River, was the Van Thanh divisional training center and a two- gun detachment of 105mm howitzers. south of the Perfume River and just west of Highway 1 was the Tam Thai military camp, headquarters of the ARVN 7th Armored Squadron Regiment equipped with M41 Walker Bulldog tanks. About to its southwest was the 101st Engineering Company compound (). The 1st Division's units were spread throughout I Corps, two battalions of the 3rd Infantry Regiment were west of Hu·∫ø, one on a routine sweep mission and the other undergoing training at the Van Thanh center, while the remaining two battalions of the regiment were searching for the PAVN-VC near the coast southeast of Hu·∫ø. The 1st Regiment was stationed near Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã to the northwest and the 2nd Regiment was another twelve kilometers farther up Highway 1 near ƒê√¥ng H√†. Under I Corps command, but available to Tr∆∞·ªüng upon his request were two battalions of the ARVN 1st Airborne Task Force and a troop of armored personnel carriers from the 7th Armored Cavalry Squadron at PK-17, the ARVN base located near a road marker on Highway 1, north of Hu·∫ø. =United States= The Marine's Phu Bai Combat Base, south of Hu·∫ø on Highway 1, included Task Force X-Ray, a brigade-size component of the 1st Marine Division built around the 1st and 5th Marine Regiments. The U.S. Army 1st and 3rd Brigades, 1st Cavalry Division and the 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, operated out of a series of firebases and landing zones between Phu Bai and Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã. Both the Marine and the airmobile units operating near Hu·∫ø were in a state of flux as the T·∫øt holiday began. The 1st Cavalry Division was in the midst of relocating from B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province in II Corps to Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã and Th·ª´a Thi√™n Provinces in I Corps. By the last week of January, most of its combat units had arrived, but many of the division‚Äôs logistical components were still in transit. When the headquarters of 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division arrived at Camp Evans, northwest of Hu·∫ø on 26 January, it found that the site held no stocks of ammunition or fuel. Supplies would remain tight for the next week as the Division's helicopters tried to build up a reserve of materiel. Within Hu·∫ø, approximately 100 U.S. Army advisers and administrative personnel, as well as a few Marine guards, were headquartered in the new city in the lightly defended MACV Compound () a block and a half south of the Perfume River on the east side of Highway 1. A rotating group of staff personnel from the compound was stationed at Tr∆∞·ªüng's headquarters day and night. Other advisers were in the countryside accompanying ARVN units. A small group of Army technicians manned a communications facility a few hundred meters to the east of the MACV Compound. Several dozen Army technical specialists and military intelligence personnel were billeted in the Huong Giang Hotel several blocks to the west. Finally, a small detachment of U.S. Navy personnel was stationed at a boat ramp just north of the MACV Compound. =North Vietnam and Viet Cong= At least two PAVN regiments, two sapper battalions, and an assortment of VC local forces were based in Th·ª´a Thi√™n Province. The headquarters of the PAVN 6th Regiment and two of its battalions were thought to be in Base Area 114, southwest of Hu·∫ø, while the third battalion from the regiment was approximately northwest of the city, operating on the coastal flats. The Hu·∫ø City Sapper Unit and the 12th Sapper Battalion were also located in Base Area 114. Several local force companies operated in the districts surrounding Hu·∫ø. The 804th Battalion of the newly created 4th Regiment was reported to be near Ph√∫ L·ªôc District, southeast of the city. A second unit from the regiment, the 810th Battalion, and several local force companies roamed the coastal plain north and east of Hu·∫ø. Unknown to Allied intelligence, the PAVN had recently shifted several more regiments and support units from Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province to the vicinity of Hu·∫ø. Among the new arrivals was the 7th Battalion of the 29th Regiment, 325C Division, a unit that until recently had been laying siege to Khe Sanh. Also new to Th·ª´a Thi√™n Province was the 5th Regiment, a three-battalion unit that normally operated from Base Area 101 near Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã. The PAVN B5 Front created a special logistical and administrative zone known as the Hu·∫ø City Front to manage the upcoming battle. The new combat headquarters, staffed by high-ranking officials from the Tr·ªã- Thi√™n-Hu·∫ø Front, local party members, and military officers from the units involved in the attack, had authority over the city and the three districts that surrounded it. On 28 January, the PAVN/VC units tasked with attacking the new city began moving into position 48 hours earlier than the northern wing tasked with attacking the Citadel, because it had a longer distance to march and more difficult terrain to cross. The 804th Battalion, 4th Regiment, began marching from Ph√∫ L·ªôc to a mountain camp south of Hu·∫ø where the majority of the southern wing was gathered. Also on 28 January, the 810th Battalion, 4th Regiment and the 2nd Sapper Battalion began marching toward the city from locations along the coast east of Hu·∫ø. On the afternoon of 29 January, the main body of the southern wing, the 804th Battalion, the 1st Sapper Battalion, the 815th and 818th Battalions of the 5th Regiment, the southern wing command group, and various supporting units descended from their mountain staging area and headed for the T·∫£ Tr·∫°ch River, which stood between the attacking force and Hu·∫ø. The units intended to use a ferry station south of the city to cross the river. The lead elements of the southern wing, the 1st Sapper Battalion and part of the 804th Battalion, arrived two hours ahead of schedule, which meant that they reached the crossing well before the sun had set. An allied aircraft spotted the units and reported their position. Artillery shells began raining down near the ferry landing and fighter-bombers soon joined the attack, which killed at least 12 PAVN-VC and scattered the rest. The Allied bombardment lasted intermittently from 17:30 until 03:30 the next day, forcing the entire southern wing to postpone the ferry crossing. The Allies did not send ground forces to investigate the incident, and no evidence exists that it generated much concern in any of the allied headquarters. The PAVN/VC crossed the river without incident on the evening of 30 January, but the delay meant that only the 1st and 2nd Sapper Battalions and an 82mm mortar company would be in their forward positions when the offensive began. Battle Map of the initial attack Premature Tet Offensive attacks at Nha Trang and Qui Nh∆°n on the morning of 30 January led to the cancellation of the T·∫øt ceasefire, but many ARVN soldiers were already away on leave, meaning that defenses in and around Hu·∫ø were undermanned. On learning of the cancellation of the ceasefire, Tr∆∞·ªüng ordered his headquarters staff to remain at the Mang Ca compound that night, he sent three platoons from the Hac Bao Reconnaissance Company to guard the provincial headquarters, the power station and the prison in the new city. He split up two more platoons to reinforce security at the various gates leading into the Citadel. His remaining Hac Bao platoon, made up of the most experienced soldiers, took up position at the centrally located T√¢y L·ªôc Airfield to act as a rapid-reaction force. News of the cancelled cease-fire never reached the MACV Compound. On the afternoon of 30 January Tr∆∞·ªüng dispatched a Hac Bao platoon and an Australian Army adviser to scout the north bank of the Perfume River which provided the simplest route from Base Area 114 into the city. After marching southwest approximately , the team concealed itself in some bushes near the river and waited. That evening, the PAVN-VC northern attack wing began moving towards Hu·∫ø from base camps in the western hills. A VC company armed with 82mm mortars and 57mm recoilless rifles veered north and took up a position near PK‚Äì17 outpost to shell the ARVN airborne and armored units stationed there once the offensive began. to the northwest, an engineer unit moved within sight of its target, the An Lo Bridge that spanned the Bo River, as it did, the 806th Battalion, one company from the 800th Battalion and a sapper platoon of forty men, all from the 6th Regiment, quietly occupied a forward staging area in a graveyard northwest of the Citadel. Around that time, the 802nd Battalion from the 6th Regiment, the remainder of the 800th Battalion, the 12th Sapper Battalion, and several heavy weapons companies marched down from the mountains to a spot on the Perfume River several kilometers west of Hu·∫ø before turning toward the Citadel. At 22:00, South Vietnamese Regional Force (RF) troops stationed in a village a few hundred meters north of the An Hoa Bridge observed what appeared to be enemy figures moving past them in the dark. RF soldiers opened fire and radioed a warning to Tr∆∞·ªüng's headquarters. ARVN troops in the Citadel fired flares over the village to help the RF troops there assess the situation. The enemy force, the forty sappers and an infantry company from the 800th Battalion that had been waiting in the graveyard northwest of An Hoa, did not return fire but crept away before they could be illuminated by the descending flares. The sappers‚Äô mission was to scale the Citadel‚Äôs wall near the Mang Ca compound, open and hold the Hau and An Hoa Gates and assist the infantry company with its attack on Tr∆∞·ªüng's headquarters. The PAVN-VC could not afford to engage in a firefight at this point, and they succeeded in sneaking away without raising further alarms. After a few minutes, the RF soldiers stopped shooting, and some began to wonder whether they had seen enemy troops or had been firing at shadows. Shortly before midnight, the reconnaissance team hiding in the bushes on the north bank of the Perfume River saw a long column of PAVN soldiers emerge from the darkness. The allied platoon stayed out of sight as the 800th, 802nd and 12th Sapper Battalions marched past its position, heading east along the river toward the city. The patrol commander reported by radio what he had seen, Tr∆∞·ªüng immediately dispatched a light observation airplane from the T√¢y L·ªôc Airfield to look for the enemy force. Flying through overcast skies, the aircraft returned two hours later, its pilot having seen nothing out of the ordinary. On the night of 30 January it started to rain; from 2 February onwards this rain, low cloud and foggy weather (known locally as the crachin) would last through much of the battle and severely hamper Allied air and artillery support. =Attack= Hue: the initial dispositions T√¢y L·ªôc airfield In the early morning hours of 31 January 1968, a division-sized force of PAVN-VC soldiers launched a coordinated attack on the city of Hu·∫ø. At 02:33, a signal flare lit up the night sky, and two battalions from the PAVN 6th Regiment attacked the western wall of the Citadel. Their objective was to capture the Mang Ca Garrison. Other objectives included the T√¢y L·ªôc Airfield and the Imperial Palace. At the Chanh Tay gate () on the west wall of the Citadel, a six-man PAVN sapper team dressed in ARVN uniforms killed the guards and opened the gate. Upon their flashlight signals, the 800th Battalion and several teams from the 12th Sapper Battalion rushed through the gate and headed northwest towards T√¢y L·ªôc Airfield. A 40-man assault team that was tasked with attacking Mang Ca through a sewer found the entrance blocked and moved around to assault the Huu Gate () at the southwest corner of the Citadel; they were engaged by an ARVN machine gun and lost 24 men before seizing their objective. The 802nd Battalion and a heavy weapons company had some trouble crossing the canal outside the southeastern wall, but entered shortly thereafter. The 806th Battalion, which was dug into a cemetery along Highway 1 near the western corner of the Citadel, dispatched a group of soldiers to capture the An Hoa Bridge, driving off the RF detachment guarding the bridge and opening a line of communication with the other PAVN-VC in the Citadel. Meanwhile, the team of thirty sappers who had scaled the northwestern wall overpowered the guards standing watch at the An Hoa and Hau Gates, then opened their doors to the infantry company waiting outside. The combined force then headed for the Mang Ca compound with the goal of neutralizing Tr∆∞·ªüng's headquarters before it had time to organize the city‚Äôs defenders. At 03:40, ten minutes behind schedule, elements of the PAVN 164th Artillery Regiment fired a barrage of 122mm rockets into the new city from firing positions in the southwestern hills. PAVN soldiers also fired 130 82mm mortar rounds into the Mang Ca Compound the opening minutes of the battle. Meanwhile, 4 km to the west of the city the PAVN 416th Battalion, 5th Regiment, as well as a local force company and a recoilless rifle company, swarmed into the villages of Thon Que Chu and Thon La Chu (). At Thon La Chu a South Vietnamese official who was a VC agent had earlier used aid money to build a three-story concrete and steel bomb shelter for local villagers and the command group of the Hu·∫ø City Front used this as its headquarters. Meanwhile, the 416th Battalion began fortifying the twin villages with spider holes, trenches and camouflaged fighting positions. At 04:00 the PAVN reached the T√¢y L·ªôc Airfield, where 50 men of the Hac Bao reconnaissance company, reinforced by the 1st Division's 1st Ordnance Company, stopped the PAVN 800th Battalion. Although one battle account stated that the South Vietnamese \\"offered no strong resistance\\", the PAVN report acknowledged \\"the heavy enemy ARVN fire enveloped the entire airfield. By dawn, our troops were still unable to advance\\". The fighting for the airfield continued to seesaw, with first the ARVN having the upper hand and then the PAVN. Meanwhile the PAVN 802nd Battalion moved north of T√¢y L·ªôc to attack Mang Ca. Although the PAVN battalion penetrated the division compound, an ad hoc 200-man defensive force of staff officers and clerks staved off the assaults. Tr∆∞·ªüng called back most of the Hac Bao Company from the airfield to bolster the headquarters' defenses, which kept division headquarters secure. At 04:40 sappers captured the Huu Gate and the command group of the PAVN 6th Regiment entered the Citadel. Outside the Citadel walls sapper teams failed to destroy the Bach Ho and Tr∆∞·ªùng Ti·ªÅn Bridges after being ambushed by RF troops. The 150 ARVN at T√¢y L·ªôc Airfield withdrew east through the city, avoiding PAVN forces and sneaked into the Mang Ca compound shortly after 07:00, just in time to help repulse another major assault from the 802nd Battalion. The reconnaissance platoon, having made its way back into the city, defended the Imperial Palace but eventually had to retreat to Mang Ca. At 08:00, PAVN troops raised a liberation flag over the Citadel flag tower. South of the river a reinforced company of the 2nd Sapper Battalion launched a simultaneous attack on the MACV Compound in the new city. The attackers were engaged by a machine gunner in a guard tower and troops in a bunker who were able to hold off the attack for long enough to allow others in the compound to form a cohesive defense. At 05:00 a reinforced company from the 1st Sapper Battalion attacked the compound from the east, but failed to penetrate the compound. After failing to take Mang Ca and the MACV Compound in their initial assaults, the PAVN-VC did not attempt to seize them again, instead keeping them under fire and generally adopting a defensive posture, this tactical mistake allowed the ARVN and U.S. to bring in the reinforcements that would eventually clear the city. East of the MACV Compound, a heavy weapons team from the 2nd Sapper Battalion attempted to destroy the communications facility. Firing at long range, they missed their target and made no further effort to take the position. A company each from the 815th and 818th Battalions entered the western edge of the new city around 04:50, eighty minutes behind schedule. The 815th Battalion had been delayed because South Vietnamese paramilitaries had ambushed the battalion at a river crossing three kilometers south of the city. The main body of the 818th Battalion had left camp later than planned and had gotten lost on its way to the city. After battling RF troops who were guarding a series of four bridges over the canal, some of the PAVN troops crossed into the city and headed for a list of targets that included the Montagnard military school, the Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS) center, the Le Loi transportation camp, the provincial administration complex and prison and the Th·ª´a Thi√™n Provincial Headquarters (). Other PAVN troops split off and attacked the Hu·∫ø railway station and a police headquarters facility near the Bach Ho Railroad Bridge. PAVN troops also seized the Tu Dam Pagoda, just south of the canal, which they soon converted to the main command post for the southern wing. Just before dawn the 804th Battalion reached the eastern outskirts of the new city, three hours behind schedule. Some elements of the battalion had been delayed by South Vietnamese paramilitary troops while others had gotten lost. With the city finally in sight, the three companies that made up the 804th Battalion headed off in different directions. One company occupied a six-way intersection on Highway 1 a few blocks southeast of the MACV Compound to prevent Allied mechanized forces from entering the city. The company also helped a group of sappers seize the Treasury Building (), the post office and a radio station a few blocks to the north. The second company from the 804th Battalion seized the An Cuu Bridge while the third company stormed a smaller bridge over the canal a short distance to the west. At dawn the only areas of the new city still under Allied control were the prison defended by a Hac Bao platoon; the Le Loi transportation camp; the Huang Giang Hotel; the MACV Compound; the communications facility; and the Navy loading dock. In the early morning a U.S. Army helicopter was shot down over the city; the crew sought refuge with a group of ARVN in a small compound. A U.S. Army UH-1 Huey piloted by Chief Warrant Officer Frederick Ferguson landed in the compound and rescued the crew under fire. For his actions Ferguson was subsequently awarded the Medal of Honor. =ARVN reinforcements= The embattled Tr∆∞·ªüng called in reinforcements ordering all four battalions of the 3rd Regiment in the countryside to return to the Citadel, he also instructed two armored units, the 3rd Troop, 7th Cavalry, stationed at PK‚Äì17, and the tank-equipped 1st Troop, 7th Cavalry, at the Tam Thai camp southeast of new city to proceed to Mang Ca. Tr∆∞·ªüng obtained permission from I Corps commander, General Ho√†ng Xu√¢n L√£m, to take control of the 1st Airborne Task Force. Although the South Vietnamese 9th Airborne Battalion was caught up in the battle for Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã, the 2nd and 7th Airborne Battalions were available at PK‚Äì17. The armored troop at Tam Thai was first to respond to Tr∆∞·ªüng's order. Shortly after 04:30, a column of M41 tanks and M113 armored personnel carriers (APCs) left the compound and headed up Highway 1. Shortly after the column crossed over the An Cuu Bridge over the Phu Cam Canal (), however, soldiers from the 1st Sapper Battalion and the 818th Battalion, hiding in and around buildings near the road, opened fire at close range with Rocket-propelled grenades, heavy machine guns and at least four 75mm recoilless rifles. The ambush destroyed several vehicles and threw the 1st Troop, 7th Cavalry, into confusion. Several M41 crews abandoned their undamaged tanks when they found their escape route blocked by burning hulks. Responding to the call at PK-17, at 09:00 the 3rd Troop and the 7th Battalion of the Airborne task force rolled out of their base area in an armored convoy onto Highway 1. A PAVN blocking force from the 806th Battalion in the graveyard stopped the ARVN relief force about 400 meters short of the Citadel wall destroying two M113s. The Airborne attempted a frontal assault on the graveyard but were unable to force their way through the PAVN positions and found themselves unable to advance or retreat and called the asked for assistance. The 2nd Airborne Battalion reinforced the convoy and conducting a flanking attack. In the early morning hours of 1 February the PAVN withdrew and at midday a Hac Bao unit led the Airborne force into Mang Ca. The cost had been heavy: the ARVN suffered 131 casualties including 40 dead, and lost four of the 12 armored personnel carriers in the convoy. The ARVN claimed to have killed 250 PAVN, captured five prisoners and recovered 71 individual and 25 crew-served weapons. The ARVN 3rd Regiment had an even more difficult time. On the 31st, two of its battalions, the 2nd and 3rd, advanced east from encampments southwest of the city along the northern bank of the Perfume River, but PAVN defensive fire forced them to fall back. Unable to enter the Citadel, the two battalions established their night positions outside the southeast wall of the Citadel. PAVN forces blocked the 1st and 4th Battalions of the regiment, operating to the southeast, as they attempted to reinforce the units in Hu·∫ø. The 1st Battalion encountered the 810th Battalion which had been deployed to block the eastern approaches to the new city, running low on ammunition Captain Phan Ngoc Luong, the commander of the 1st Battalion, retreated with his unit to the coastal Ba Long outpost, arriving there with only three eight-round clips per man for their World War II vintage M1 Garand rifles. At Ba Long, the battalion then embarked upon motorized junks and reached the Citadel the following day. The 4th Battalion ran into a blocking force from the 2nd Sapper Battalion and a company from the 810th Battalion. The government troops tried to fight their way through but lacked the strength or the firepower to do so. Four days would pass before they were at last able to punch a hole in the PAVN-VC lines and reach the MACV compound. South of the city, on 31 January Lieutenant colonel Phan Hu Chi, the commander of the ARVN 7th Armored Cavalry Squadron, attempted to break the PAVN-VC stranglehold. He led an armored column toward Hu·∫ø, but like the other South Vietnamese units, found it impossible to break through. With the promise of U.S. Marine reinforcements, Chi's column, with three tanks in the lead, tried once more. This time they crossed the An Cuu Bridge into the new city. Coming upon the central police headquarters in southern Hu·∫ø, the tanks attempted to relieve the police defenders, but a B-40 rocket made a direct hit on Chi's tank, killing him instantly. The South Vietnamese armor pulled back. =U.S. Marines= U.S. Marines clear buildings in southern Hu·∫ø supported by tanks Three USMC battalions were protecting Phu Bai Combat Base, Highway 1 and all western approaches to Hu·∫ø. This was an operational area that actually required two complete regiments to secure. On the night of 30/31 January, the Marines faced rocket and mortar fire at the Phu Bai Combat Base and PAVN-VC infantry units hit Marine combined action platoons (CAP) and local Popular Force and RF units in the region, including the Truoi River and Ph√∫ L·ªôc sectors. At about 04:00 a PAVN company attacked the ARVN security detachment defending the Highway 1 bridge over the Truoi River () and the nearby CAP H-8. 1st Marine Regiment commander Colonel Stanley S. Hughes, ordered Captain George R. Christmas, commander of Company H, 2nd Battalion 5th Marines to relieve the CAP unit and Company H engaged the PAVN-VC as they withdrew from the CAP position. Seeing an opportunity to trap the PAVN-VC, Lieutenant colonel Ernie Cheatham reinforced Company H with his Command Group and Company F. With his other companies in blocking positions, Cheatham hoped to pin the PAVN-VC against the Truoi River. However at 10:30, 31 January Company G was ordered to Phu Bai as the Task Force reserve and Company F was removed from Hughes' operational control later that afternoon. With the departure of Company F about 16:30, the PAVN-VC successfully disengaged and Companies H and E took up night defensive positions. 2/5 Marines killed 18 PAVN or VC and captured one, at a cost of three Marines killed and 13 wounded. While the fighting continued in the Truoi River and the Ph√∫ L·ªôc sectors, the 1st Battalion, 1st Marines had begun to move into Hu·∫ø. In the early morning of 31 January, after the rocket bombardment of the airfield and the initial attack on the Truoi River Bridge, Task Force X-Ray received reports of strikes all along Highway 1 between the H·∫£i V√¢n Pass and Hu·∫ø. All told, the PAVN-VC hit some 18 targets from bridges, CAP units, and company defensive positions. With Company A, 1/1 Marines as the Phu Bai reserve, Hughes directed Lieutenant colonel Marcus Gravel to prepare the company for any contingency. At 06:30, Hughes ordered the company to reinforce the Truoi River Bridge. Captain Gordon Batcheller later recalled that \\"we were rousted up about 04:00 on the 31st and launched south on trucks to rendezvous with and reinforce ARVN forces about a map sheet and a half south of Phu Bai.\\" The convoy was then turned around and sent towards Hu·∫ø. Up to this point the fighting for Hu·∫ø had been entirely a South Vietnamese affair. Brigadier general Foster LaHue, the Task Force X-Ray commander, actually had very little reliable intelligence on the situation. All he knew was that Tr∆∞·ªüng's headquarters had been under attack, as was the MACV Compound. Because of enemy mortaring of the LCU ramp in southern Hu·∫ø, the allies had stopped all river traffic to the city. As LaHue later wrote: \\"Initial deployment of forces was made with limited information.\\" =Initial U.S. Marines counter-attacks= An M50 Ontos leads evacuation convoy of commandeered vehicles, 31 January As the Marines approached the southern suburbs of the city they came under increasing fire from the PAVN 804th Battalion. In one village, the troops dismounted and cleared the houses on either side of the main street before proceeding. During this fighting Company A, 1/1 Marines commander Captain Batchellor was wounded and Gunnery Sergeant John L. Canley assumed command of the Company. He and Sergeant Alfredo Cantu Gonzalez led the Marines in the defense of the convoy, actions for which both men would later be awarded the Medal of Honor. The Marine convoy stopped several times to eliminate resistance in heavy house-to-house fighting before proceeding again. At about 15:15 the Marines managed to make their way toward the MACV Compound. By this time, the PAVN-VC attackers had pulled back their forces from the immediate vicinity of the Compound. Gravel met with Army Colonel George O. Adkisson, the senior U.S. advisor to the ARVN 1st Division. Leaving Company A behind to secure the MACV Compound, Gravel took Company G, reinforced by the three M48 tanks from the 3rd Tank Battalion and a few ARVN M24 light tanks from the 7th Armored Cavalry Squadron, and attempted to cross the Tr∆∞·ªùng Ti·ªÅn Bridge, the main bridge over the Perfume River. Gravel left the armor behind on the southern bank to provide direct fire support. As he later remembered, the American M48s were too heavy for the bridge and the ARVN tankers \\"refused to go.\\" As the Marine infantry started across, a machine gun on the other end of the bridge opened fire, killing and wounding several Marines. One Marine, Lance corporal Lester A. Tully, later awarded the Silver Star for his action, ran forward, threw a grenade, and silenced the gun. Two platoons successfully made their way to the other side. They turned left and immediately came under automatic weapons and recoilless rifle fire from the Citadel wall. The Marines decided to withdraw. This was easier said than done as the PAVN-VC were well dug-in and firing from virtually every building in the Citadel. With the number of wounded rising, the Marines commandeered some abandoned Vietnamese civilian vehicles and used them as makeshift ambulances to carry out the wounded. Among the casualties on the bridge was Major Walter M. Murphy, the 1st Battalion S-3, or operations officer, who later died of his wounds. U.S. Marines wounded during the battle By 20:00, the 1/1 Marines had established defensive positions near the MACV Compound and a helicopter landing zone in a field just west of the Navy LCU Ramp in southern Hu·∫ø. On that first day, the two Marine companies in Hu·∫ø had sustained casualties of 10 killed and 56 wounded. During the night, the battalion called helicopter into the landing zone to take out the most badly wounded. The American command still had little realization of the situation in Hu·∫ø. North of the Perfume River, on 1 February, the ARVN 1st Division enjoyed some limited success. Although the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 3rd Regiment remained outside of the Citadel walls, unable to penetrate the PAVN defenses; the 2nd and 7th Airborne Battalions, supported by armored personnel carriers and the Hac Bao Company, recaptured the T√¢y L·ªôc airfield. At about 15:00, the ARVN 1st Battalion, 3rd Regiment reached the 1st Division command post at the Mang Ca compound. Later that day, U.S. Marine helicopters from HMM-165 brought part of the ARVN 4th Battalion, 2nd Regiment from ƒê√¥ng H√† Combat Base into the Citadel. Eight CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters made the flight in marginal weather with a ceiling and visibility, arriving at an improvised landing zone under enemy mortar fire. The deteriorating weather forced the squadron to cancel the remaining lifts with about half of the battalion in the Citadel. Shortly after 15:00, Company F, 2/5 Marines made a helicopter landing into southern Hu·∫ø. They were to relieve a MACV Microwave/Tropo communications facility approximately 2.5 km southeast of the MACV Compound surrounded by a VC force. Operated by the United States Army Signal Corps 513th Signal Detachment, 337th Signal Company, 37th Signal Battalion, it was the main communications link for the Hu·∫ø area, the DMZ and for the besieged Khe Sanh Combat Base. The company spent the better part of the afternoon trying to reach the isolated communications site. They were unsuccessful and Company F sustained casualties of three dead and 13 wounded. =The 1st Cavalry Division attacks PAVN supply lines= 1st Cavalry Division helicopter resupply mission northwest of Hue On 20 January, the 1st Cavalry Division began moving from Landing Zone English in B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province 350 km north to Camp Evans as part of Operation Checkers. While the helicopters and men of the Division were soon in position, most of their heavy and support equipment was loaded on trucks that would have to proceed by convoy up Highway 1. While a new supply port was being constructed on the coast, the Division relied on the Marine supply base at T√¢n M·ªπ and supply convoys along Highway 1 from Da Nang. On the night of 31 January, the PAVN-VC launched a mortar attack on Camp Evans which caused an ammunition dump to explode, disabling most of the helicopters of the 229th Assault Helicopter Battalion. Other attacks along Highway 1 damaged or destroyed 20 bridges and 26 culverts between the H·∫£i V√¢n Pass and Phu Bai and Highway 1 was closed to convoy traffic until early March. On 1 February, III Marine Amphibious Force (III MAF) Commander Lieutenant General Robert Cushman alerted the 1st Cavalry Division commander, Major General John J. Tolson, to be ready to deploy his 3rd Brigade into a sector west of Hu·∫ø. By 22:15 that night, Tolson's command had agreed with III MAF on its designated area of operations in the Hu·∫ø sector. Tolson's plan called for an air assault by two battalions of the 3rd Brigade northwest of Hu·∫ø. The 2nd Battalion, 12th Cavalry was to arrive in the landing zone first, followed by the 5th Battalion, 7th Cavalry to be inserted near PK-17. Attacking in a southeasterly direction, the two battalions would then attempt to close the PAVN-VC supply line into Hu·∫ø. During the mid-afternoon of 2 February, the 2/12th Cavalry arrived in a landing zone about northwest of Hu·∫ø. The Cavalry force soon encountered two dug-in PAVN Battalions around the villages of Thon Que Chu and Thon La Chu which they were unable to overcome as fog prevented their usual gunship support. The 2/12th Cavalry withdrew to a night defensive perimeter, but at dawn on 3 February following a mortar barrage the PAVN attacked their position. This was only beaten back with heavy artillery fire. Losses continued to mount throughout the day from mortar and small arms fire and that night the Battalion commander decided to breakout from the encirclement by a night march to an ARVN position on Nha Nanh hill () from where they could be resupplied and the casualties medevaced. On reaching the ARVN base, the 2/12th Cavalry dug in there for the next 4 days. 5/7th Cavalry in action at Thon La Chu On 8 February 5/7th Cavalry began moving southwest from PK-17 towards La Chu while 2/12th Cavalry were ordered to retrace their route to form the southern pincer for an attack on the PAVN stronghold. As the 5/7th Cavalry approached Que Chu the command and control helicopter was shot down by anti- aircraft fire, the crew was rescued by a dustoff helicopter. Company B then walked into an ambush north of Que Chu and was pinned down in the open with little cover, they were only able to withdraw after calling in close artillery support. Company D was also engaged by PAVN in the village of Lieu Coc and forced to withdraw. 1/7th Cavalry then dug in to night defensive positions. On 9 February 5/7th Cavalry resumed their advance with artillery support from PK-17 and naval gunfire; they overran Lieu Coc finding PAVN bodies and fighting positions. As they moved closer to La Chu, PAVN resistance increased and it was obvious that this was a major PAVN base. 5/7th Cavalry would be stalled north of La Chu for 2 weeks, probing but failing to penetrate the PAVN defenses. On 16 February deputy COMUSMACV General Creighton Abrams flew into PK-17 for a meeting with Tolson where Abrams expressed his displeasure at the Cavalry's slow progress. Following this visit two more cavalry battalions (1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment and 2nd Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment) and additional air and artillery support were committed to the attack on La Chu. On 21 February following intensive radar-guided airstrikes and artillery strikes, the four Cavalry battalions launched a four-pronged attack from the north, west and south on Que Chu and La Chu. The PAVN strongly defended the perimeter, but once the Cavalry forces broke through with the support of two newly arrived M42 Dusters, they found that the base had been largely abandoned while the Cavalry had been building up their forces for the attack. The Cavalry had finally captured the PAVN's main support base, but were still 8 km from the Citadel. Sergeant Joe Hooper of the 2/501st would subsequently be awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in this engagement. On the morning of 22 February, the 1/7th Cavalry, remained in Thon Que Chu and Thon La Chu to mop up pockets of resistance while the remaining units under 3rd Brigade control began marching toward the Citadel. They advanced along parallel tracks, with the 5/7th Cavalry, following the course of Highway 1; the 2/501st Infantry, searching the central route; and the 2/12th Cavalry, sweeping the area to the south. In mid-morning the 5/7th Cavalry, came under heavy fire from an estimated company-size force who occupied the hamlet of Thon An, approximately one kilometer from the An Hoa Bridge. Helicopter gunships and artillery and the pair of Dusters systematically leveled any structure that appeared to serve as a strong point. The supporting fire continued throughout the day, but the PAVN did not abandon their positions. With darkness approaching the attack was postponed until the next morning. Meanwhile, several kilometers to the south, the 2/12th Cavalry, made contact with another PAVN force just before noon. Several companies of PAVN armed with mortars, machine guns, recoilless rifles and RPGs were strongly entrenched along the south side of the Sau Canal, a deep waterway that ran toward the Citadel perpendicular to the Perfume River. On 23 February, the 2/12th Cavalry and the 2/501st Infantry, resumed their battle at the Sau Canal. The PAVN occupied a rectangular slice of land between the canal and the Perfume River that was approximately fifteen hundred meters wide and less than a kilometer deep, however U.S. efforts to overrun this position were repeatedly repulsed as the PAVN fought to keep open their escape route from the Citadel. The 3rd Brigade would not reach the west wall of the Citadel until 25 February by which time the PAVN-VC had successfully withdrawn from the battlefield. It was estimated that it would have taken at least 16 battalions to establish an effective cordon around Hu·∫ø, at this time there were only 30 battalions available in all of I Corps. =Recapture of southern Hu·∫ø= Vietnamese civilians escaping the fighting pass the destroyed Tr∆∞·ªùng Ti·ªÅn Bridge On the night of 1/2 February PAVN sappers successfully brought down the Bach Ho (railroad) and the Tr∆∞·ªùng Ti·ªÅn bridges across the Perfume River, restricting movement from the south towards the Citadel, but failed to destroy the An Cuu Bridge over the Phu Cam Canal. On 2 February, the Marines made some minor headway and brought in further reinforcements. A company from the 2/5th Marines finally relieved the MACV communications facility that morning. Gravel launched a two-company assault supported by tanks towards the Provincial Headquarters and Thua Thien Prison, seven blocks west of the MACV Compound where the ARVN were believed to still be holding out. The Marines did not progress further than one block before their advance was halted by troops from the PAVN 815th Battalion and after three hours of room to room fighting, the Marines captured the Hu·∫ø University building at the base of the Tr∆∞·ªùng Ti·ªÅn Bridge two blocks northwest of the MACV Compound, so reducing enemy fire towards the LCU ramp. The Marines then tried to assault the Treasury Building in the next block, but were stopped by fire from the 100 plus PAVN defenders and flanking fire from the Le Loi Elementary School. The battalion consolidated its night defensive positions and waited to renew its attack the following day. About 11:00, Company H, 2/5 Marines, crossed the An Cuu Bridge in an armed convoy. As the convoy, accompanied by Army trucks equipped with quad .50 machine guns and two M50 Ontos, entered the city, enemy snipers opened up on the Marine reinforcements. Near the MACV Compound, the Marines came under heavy machine gun and rocket fire. The Army gunners and the Marine Ontos quickly responded. In the resulting confusion, the convoy exchanged fire with a Marine unit already in the city. About mid-day, the PAVN continued to block any advance to the south. A 75 mm recoilless rifle knocked out one of the supporting tanks. By the end of the day, the Marines had sustained two dead and 34 wounded and claimed to have killed nearly 140 PAVN-VC. That night the PAVN 815th Battalion overran the ARVN defenders at the Thua Thien Prison releasing the 2,500 prisoners, including 350 VC who were soon armed with captured ARVN weapons and joined the fighting. 106 mm recoilless rifle from within Hu·∫ø University to target a PAVN machine gun emplacement Back at Phu Bai, Cheatham was reviewing Marine urban fighting doctrine which recommended staying off the streets and moving forward by blasting through walls and buildings. He proceeded to gather the necessary equipment including M20 Bazookas, M40 106 mm recoilless rifles mounted on M274 Mules, C-4 explosive, flamethrowers, tear gas and gas masks. This equipment was loaded onto a convoy which arrived at the MACV Compound at 13:00 on 3 February. Cheatham then joined his company commanders in Hu·∫ø University and they proceeded to develop the tactics to be used in recapturing southern Hu·∫ø. Many of the Marines of Task Force X-Ray had little or no urban combat experience and the U.S. troops were not trained for urban close-quarters combat, so this battle was especially tough for them. Due to Hu·∫ø's religious and cultural status, Allied forces were ordered not to bomb or shell the city, for fear of destroying the historic structures. Also, since it was still monsoon season with heavy rain and low clouds on many days during the battle, it was virtually impossible for the U.S. forces to use air support. But as the intensity of the battle increased, the policy was eliminated. PAVN tactics were to hold the Marines close, negating the use of artillery and air support. A forward fighting line was maintained directly opposite the Marines with a secondary line two blocks back. Each building on the fighting lines was defended by snipers and machine guns, while spider holes were dug in gardens and streets, creating cross-fire between all buildings and streets. If the Marines penetrated the forward line the PAVN moved to the secondary line and then reoccupied the abandoned positions at night. On the night of 3 February, the PAVN commander, seeing the buildup of Marines at Hu·∫ø University, thinned out his frontline forces leaving just a platoon to defend the Treasury building and adjacent Post Office. On the morning of 4 February the Marines launched their attack on the Treasury. The initial assault was on the left flank by Company A, 1/1 Marines which was tasked with securing a Catholic chapel and the Jeanne d'Arc High School (). The Marines secured the chapel and the east school building, but were pinned down for hours by interlocking fire from the west building. During this action Sergeant Gonzalez was killed while firing on PAVN machine gun positions. The Marines eventually broke into the west building and cleared it room by room. Due to the delays on the left flank, the main assault in the center by Company F, 2/5 Marines was delayed until mid-afternoon. The Treasury building was hit by M-48 and 106 mm fire and tear gas, while a M274 Mule-mounted 106mm recoilless rifle engaged the machine gun in the Le Loi Elementary School. Under cover of the tear gas and the 106mm backblast the Marines crossed the street and blew holes in the wall using C-4 and Bazookas. The Marines then pushed into the Treasury building which the PAVN had hastily abandoned. The Post Office also seemed abandoned until the Marines located a vault inside the building, they proceeded to gas out the PAVN inside killing more than 24 of them as they emerged. After securing the Jeanne d'Arc High School, Company A, 1/1 Marines recaptured the Le Loi Elementary School. More than half the Company's 147 men had been wounded or killed in that day's fighting. That evening VC sappers succeeded in blowing up the An Cuu bridge, cutting the road link to Phu Bai. Hu·∫ø Hospital out of harm's way Following the capture of the Treasury, Cheatham continued his methodical advance to the west leading with tear gas, M-48s and Ontos, followed by Mules and Marines, while PAVN-VC resistance lessened as its manpower and ammunition was depleted. The PAVN-VC no longer tenaciously defended each building, relying more on sniper fire, mortars and rockets. On 5 February the Marines recaptured the Hu·∫ø Central Hospital complex (), rescuing Lieutenant Colonel Pham Van Khoa (the Mayor of Hu·∫ø and Thua Thien Province chief), who had been hiding in the grounds. On 6 February the Marines attacked the Provincial Headquarters which served as the command post of the PAVN 4th Regiment. While the Marines seized the surrounding wall easily, the area between the wall and the building was covered by fire from every window and from spider-holes in the grounds. An Ontos was brought forward to blast an entry into the building, but was disabled by a B-40 rocket. A Mule was brought forward to blow a hole in the building and the Marines advanced under cover of tear gas. Entering the building the Marines fought room by room, clearing the building, but many of the PAVN slipped away. With the building secured the Marines then methodically cleared out the spider-holes, shooting their occupants. The Marines raised an American flag to celebrate their victory, but shortly thereafter were ordered to lower it, as according to South Vietnamese law, no American flag was permitted to be flown without an accompanying South Vietnamese flag. After resting his men at the Provincial Headquarters, Cheatham resumed his advance west towards the Phu Cam Canal, then swung south and east to clear the area with the canal to his right. On 7 February the PAVN twice ambushed a 25 vehicle supply convoy supported by two Ontos going along Route 547 () from Phu Bai to the 11th Marines Firebase Rockcrusher () which provided artillery support to Allied forces fighting in and around Hu·∫ø. These ambushes killed 20 Marines and wounded 39. The PAVN forces in the new city, worn down by more than a week of incessant combat and effectively cut off from their comrades on the other side of the river, began to slowly abandon the city, the 815th and 2nd Sapper Battalions moved to the southern side of the Phu Cam Canal, where the 818th Battalion was already in place. The 804th Battalion and the 1st Sapper Battalion remained south of the canal near the An Cuu Bridge while the 810th Battalion began preparing to sneak west across the Perfume River by raft and boat to Gia Hoi Island. Gravel's 1/1 Marines had been clearing the area to the east and south of the MACV Compound and on 10 February they captured the soccer stadium (), providing a second, safer helicopter landing zone. A pontoon bridge had been built across the Phu Cam Canal, restoring the road access that had been lost when the An Cuu Bridge was blown up. On 11 February Company H, 2/5 Marines secured a bridge over the Phu Cam Canal () and the block on the opposite side of the canal. The next day Company F swept the west bank of the canal, fighting through houses and the Hu·∫ø Railway Station that had been sheltering PAVN snipers, before withdrawing back across the bridge. On 13 February Companies F and H crossed the bridge again with the aim of securing the entire area. As the Marines advanced into the open countryside towards the T·ª´ ƒê√†m Pagoda they located fresh PAVN graves and then were hit by a barrage of mortar fire, forcing them to withdraw. The Marines had inadvertently located the PAVN headquarters for the battle. On 13 February, Abrams established MACV Forward at Phu Bai, effectively replacing Cushman and assuming overall control of all U.S. forces in I Corps. =Battle for the Citadel= U.S. Marines assault the Dong Ba Gate in the Citadel Within the ARVN 1st Battalion, 3rd Regiment and 2nd and 7th Airborne Battalions cleared out the north and western parts of the Citadel including the Chanh Tay Gate, while the 4th Battalion, 2nd Regiment moved south from Mang Ca towards the Imperial Palace, killing over 700 PAVN-VC by 4 February. On 5 February Tr∆∞·ªüng exchanged the Airborne with the 4th Battalion, which had become stalled. The 4th Battalion, 3rd Regiment, south of the river, crossed the river and assaulted the Thuong Tu Gate near the eastern corner of the Citadel. When seven successive attempts to breach the gate failed, the battalion joined the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 3rd Regiment, near the southern corner of the Citadel. On 6 February, the 1st Battalion captured the An Hoa Gate on the northwest corner of the Citadel and the 4th Battalion captured the southwest wall. On the night of the 6th, the PAVN counterattacked, with a battalion from the 29th Regiment scaling the southwest wall and pushing the 4th Battalion back to T√¢y L·ªôc. On the 7th the 3rd Regiment, which had been futilely trying to break into the southeast corner of the Citadel, was moved by Mike boats to Mang Ca to reinforce his units inside the Citadel. The ARVN 2nd Troop, 7th Cavalry, equipped with fifteen M113s arrived at Mang Ca from Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã to relieve the 3rd Troop. To avoid ambushes it turned off Highway 1 a few kilometers north of the city, traveled east cross-country, and swung around the rear of Mang Ca through the Trai Gate. Also on 7 February, the North Vietnamese tried to bring their own air support into the battle, sending four Vietnam People's Air Force Il-14 transport aircraft from an airfield near Hanoi. Two of the aircraft carrying explosives, antitank ammunition and field telephone cables managed to find an opening in the cloud layer about north of Hu·∫ø. They dropped their cargoes in a large lagoon for local forces to retrieve. One of the aircraft returned safely; but the other, flying through dense fog, crashed into a mountain, losing all on board. Meanwhile, the other two IL‚àí14s, which had been modified to drop bombs, had orders to bomb Mang Ca. Neither flight crew could find the city in the fog, however, and both aircraft returned to North Vietnam without dropping their bombs. They tried again five days later, but once again, bad weather prevented them from locating Mang Ca. The two aircraft radioed that they were scrubbing the mission, then headed out to sea to jettison their bombs. A short time later, their transmissions went dead and they were never heard from again. On 10 February two forward observers from the Marines' 1st Field Artillery Group were flown into T√¢y L·ªôc to help coordinate artillery and naval gunfire to support the fighting within the Citadel, however Tr∆∞·ªüng instructed them that the Imperial Palace was not to be fired on. On 11 February the Vietnamese Marines Task Force A comprising the 1st and 5th Battalions, began to be lifted by helicopter into Mang Ca to replace the Airborne, however due to poor weather this deployment would not be completed until 13 February. At 10:45 on 11 February Company B, 1st Battalion, 5th Marines was airlifted aboard Marine CH-46s into Mang Ca, but enemy fire forced several of the helicopters to return to Phu Bai. The Marines together with five M48s from the 1st Tank Battalion would later be loaded onto Mike boats at the LCU ramp in southern Hu·∫ø and ferried across to Mang Ca. A U.S. Marine fires his M60 machine gun during the fight for the Citadel On 13 February Companies A and C, 1/5 Marines left Mang Ca and moved south along the eastern wall of the Citadel, while Company B remained in reserve. Unknown to the Marines, the ARVN Airborne had withdrawn from the area two days previously when the Vietnamese Marines began to arrive at Mang Ca and the PAVN defenders had used this opportunity to reoccupy several blocks and reinforce their defenses, Company A was engaged by the PAVN and quickly suffered 35 casualties. The 1/5 Marines commander Major Robert Thompson ordered Company B up to relieve Company A and the advance continued slowly until it was halted by PAVN flanking fire from the Dong Ba Gate (). On 14 February the Marines resumed their attack supported by Marine and Navy gun fire and Marine close air support. Despite this they made little progress, as they had to withdraw when supporting fire was called in and the PAVN quickly reoccupied abandoned positions. After a day of attacks the Marines withdrew to their night defensive positions. Company D, 1/5 Marines arrived in the Citadel on the evening of 14 February after taking fire while crossing the Perfume River. On 15 February Company D led the renewed attack against the Dong Ba Gate with Company C defending its flank. Company B joined the assault and after six hours the Marines had secured the base of the gate and later the entire gate, at a cost of six Marines killed and 50 wounded and 20 PAVN killed. Overnight the PAVN counterattacked and briefly regained control of the gate before being forced out by Company D. CH-46 from MAG-36 drops Vietnamese Marines into Hue on 23 February O-1 flies past the Citadel Also on 14 February the South Vietnamese Marine Task Force A joined the battle. The operational plan was for the Marines to move west from T√¢y L·ªôc and then turn south. However, they were soon stopped by strong PAVN defenses; after two days the Vietnamese Marines had only advanced 400 meters. Meanwhile, the ARVN 3rd Regiment fought off a PAVN counterattack in the northwest corner of the Citadel. Despite their reducing hold on the city the PAVN seemed determined to prolong the battle for the Citadel. The 6th Battalion, 24th Regiment, 304th Division, originally located near Khe Sanh, reached the Citadel after following a route that took it through Base Area 101, Base Area 114 and Thon La Chu and the 7th Battalion, 90th Regiment, 324B Division, was due to arrive a few days later after a forced march from the DMZ. On 16 February two companies from the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, fought elements of the 803rd Regiment, 324B Division, about northeast of Hu·∫ø, killing 29 PAVN before they broke contact the following day. On 16 February the 1/5 Marines advanced approximately 140 meters for a cost of seven Marines killed and 47 wounded and 63 PAVN killed. That day at a meeting at Phu Bai between Generals Abrams, LaHue, Tr∆∞·ªüng and South Vietnamese Vice President Nguy·ªÖn Cao K·ª≥, K·ª≥ approved the use of all necessary force to clear the PAVN-VC forces from the Citadel, regardless of damage to historic structures. On the night of 16 February a radio intercept indicated that a battalion-size PAVN force was about to launch a counterattack over the west wall of the Citadel. Artillery and naval gunfire was called in and a later radio intercept indicated that a senior PAVN officer had been killed in the barrage. Later that night a radio message from the commander of PAVN forces in the Citadel was intercepted, he stated that his predecessor had been killed and requested permission to withdraw from the city, but this was denied and he was told to stand and fight. On 17 February the Vietnamese Marines and ARVN 3rd Regiment resumed their attacks south, while the Hac Bao Company was moved to support the right flank of the 1/5 Marines. Over the next three days these forces would slowly reduce the PAVN's perimeter. On 18 February the 1/8th Cavalry was attacked by elements of the 803rd Regiment northeast of Hu·∫ø, this second clash apparently convinced the PAVN command that the Regiment could not reach the Citadel. By 20 February the 1/5 Marines advance had stalled and after conferring with his commanders Thompson decided to launch a night attack against three PAVN strongpoints that were blocking further movement with the entire battalion attacking at daybreak. At 03:00 on 21 February, three ten-man teams from 2nd Platoon of Company A launched their assault, quickly capturing the sparsely defended strongpoints which the PAVN had withdrawn from overnight. As the PAVN moved to reoccupy the strongpoints at dawn they were caught in the open by the Marines, 16 PAVN were killed for the loss of three Marines. The Marines were now only 100 meters from the south wall of the Citadel. That evening Company B was replaced by Company L, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines. Unknown to the ARVN and the U.S., on the night of 20 February the PAVN had begun a phased withdrawal from the Citadel, leaving through the Huu and Nha Do () Gates and making their way southwest to return to their bases in the hills. At 09:30 on 22 February, Company A, 1/5 Marines led the day's attack to find that the PAVN had largely disappeared and the south wall was soon secured. Company L, 3/5 Marines was then tasked with clearing the area to the Thuong Tu Gate and out to the Tr∆∞·ªùng Ti·ªÅn Bridge. Advancing with tank and air support they completed the mission meeting little resistance. To the west, the South Vietnamese forces continued to meet stubborn resistance. On 22 February after a barrage of 122 mm rockets the PAVN counterattacked the Vietnamese Marines, who pushed them back with the support of the Hac Bao Company. 23 February saw little progress, prompting a frustrated Abrams to suggest that the Vietnamese Marine Corps should be dissolved. On the night of 23 February the PAVN attempted another counterattack, but were forced back by artillery fire. The ARVN 3rd Regiment launched a night attack along the southern wall of the Citadel. At 05:00 they raised the South Vietnamese flag on the Citadel flag tower and proceeded to secure the southern wall by 10:25. Tr∆∞·ªüng then ordered the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Regiment and the Hac Bao Company to recapture the Imperial Palace and this was achieved against minimal resistance by late afternoon. The last pocket of PAVN at the southwest corner of the Citadel was eliminated in an attack by the 4th Vietnamese Marine Battalion in the early hours of 25 February. Mopping-up operations On 22 February the ARVN 21st and the 39th Ranger Battalions boarded junks and traveled to Gia Hoi Island (), between the east wall of the Citadel and the Perfume River where the Communist provisional government had been headquartered since the start of the offensive. The Rangers swept the island as thousands of local residents came out of hiding and ran through their ranks to escape the battle. The toughest fight of the day centered on a pagoda that contained a PAVN battalion headquarters. The sweep continued until 25 February. The three-day operation netted hundreds of VC cadre, many of whom were university students who, according to local residents, had played a key role in rounding up government officials and intellectuals the PAVN/VC regarded as threats to their new regime. On 23 February a company from the 5/7th Cavalry, boarded helicopters and flew to the docks near Mang Ca, where it joined a platoon of armored personnel carriers from Troop A, 3rd Squadron, 5th Cavalry Regiment, on loan from the 9th Infantry Division which had just arrived in the Phu Bai‚ÄìHu·∫ø region after redeploying from Long Kh√°nh Province to northern I Corps by sea. The mechanized task force swept along the northwestern wall toward the An Hoa Bridge, flushing out a number of PAVN soldiers who had taken refuge in the grasses and weeds. Meanwhile, two kilometers to the northwest, the remainder of the 5/7th Cavalry, resumed its advance toward Thon An. The cavalrymen fought their way into the PAVN-occupied hamlet and found beneath its shattered remains a honeycomb of tunnels and bunkers and spent the rest of the day searching the ruins for survivors and combing through the adjacent cemetery, where the 806th Battalion had ambushed the ARVN 7th Airborne Battalion on 31 January. On 24 February, the 5/7th Cavalry, rejoined its detached company and the armored cavalry platoon from the 3/5th Cavalry, near the western corner of the Citadel. The combined force then swept toward the Bach Ho Railroad Bridge along the southwestern face of the Citadel, where a few PAVN still held out in a narrow band of trees between the moat and the wall. While 1/1 Marines conducted mopping-up operations in southern Hu·∫ø, 2/5 Marines had been conducting patrols south of the Phu Cam Canal. On 24 February 2/5 Marines launched an operation to the southwest of Hu·∫ø to relieve the ARVN 101st Engineering Company compound which had been under siege by the PAVN since the start of the battle. As the Marines approached the base at 07:00 they were met by PAVN mortar and machine-gun fire; artillery fire was called in on the PAVN positions and the Marines entered the base at 08:50. The base remained under fire from PAVN positions in a Buddhist temple to the south and from a ridgeline to the west and at 07:00 on 25 February Companies F and G began to attack the ridgeline, but were met by intense mortar fire. Under cover of supporting fire the Marines secured part of the ridgeline, killing three PAVN for the loss of one Marine killed. The attack resumed the following morning and the ridge was secured with 20 PAVN and two Marines killed. Company H attacked a nearby hill meeting a stubborn defense, losing one dead and killing six PAVN. Company H withdrew so that air strikes could be launched and these knocked out mortar and machine gun positions killing 20 PAVN; however, one bomb fell short killing four Marines. On 27 February the entire battalion attacked the hill but the PAVN had withdrawn during the night, leaving behind 14 dead. On 28 February 1/5 Marines and 2/5 Marines launched an operation to the east of Hu·∫ø to try to cut off any PAVN forces moving from Hu·∫ø towards the coast. While the Marines encountered few PAVN in their sweeps they located various abandoned infrastructure that had been used to support the battle, including a 3 km trench system with over 600 fighting holes. On 2 March 1968 the Marines concluded Operation Hu·∫ø City. Aftermath U.S. Marines emerge from the battle-damaged Jeanne d'Arc church in southern Hu·∫ø The fighting in other parts of South Vietnam during Tet was generally confined to a week or sometimes less; the battle for Hu·∫ø was the longest, lasting from 31 January through 2 March 1968. ARVN losses were 452 killed and 2,123 wounded, while U.S. losses were 216 killed and 1,584 wounded. PAVN-VC losses are a matter of debate. The PAVN's Department of Warfare gives figures of 2,400 killed and 3,000 wounded from 30 January until 28 March. A PAVN document captured by the ARVN stated that 1,042 troops had been killed in the city proper and that several times that number had been wounded. MACV gave figures of 5,133 PAVN-VC killed at Hu·∫ø. 844 civilians were killed and 1,900 wounded during the battle. 4,856 civilians and captured ARVN personnel were executed by the PAVN-VC or went missing during the battle according to the South Vietnamese Government. In addition to the significant civilian casualties inflicted in the battle, eighty percent of the city was destroyed and 116,000 civilians out of the pre- battle population of 140,000 were made homeless. Hu·∫ø under Communist control The PAVN-VC were generally greeted with little enthusiasm by the population of Hu·∫ø. Power and water supply into the city had been cut off, and people were aware that the ARVN and U.S. forces would soon counterattack. While a few joined the PAVN-VC and others supported them by digging fortifications and preparing food, most of the population either tried to flee behind the ARVN-U.S. lines or took shelter in their homes or in churches and pagodas, which they hoped would be safe. The PAVN set up provisional authorities shortly after capturing Hu·∫ø, charged with removing the existing Republic of Vietnam administration from power within the city and replacing it with a \\"revolutionary administration\\". Working from lists of \\"cruel tyrants and reactionary elements\\" previously developed by VC intelligence officers, many people were to be rounded up during the initial hours of the attack. These included ARVN soldiers, civil servants, political party members, local religious leaders, schoolteachers, American civilians and other expatriates. Cadres called out the names on their lists over loudspeakers, ordering them to report to a local school. Those not reporting voluntarily were hunted down. The PAVN-VC's actions were based on a series of orders issued by the PAVN High Command and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam (PRG). In a 3500-page document issued on 26 January 1968 by the Tr·ªã- Thi√™n-Hu·∫ø Political Directorate, the political cadres were given specific instructions: Operating in close support of the regular military and guerrilla elements, the political cadre were to: destroy and disorganize the Republic of Vietnam's administrative machinery \\"from province and district levels to the city wards, streets, and wharves; motivate the people of Hu·∫ø to take up arms, pursue the enemy, seize power, and establish a revolutionary government; motivate (recruit) local citizens for military and \\"security\\" forces ... transportation and supply activities, and to serve wounded soldiers... pursue to the end (and) punish spies, reactionaries, and tyrants and maintain order and security in the city.\\" Those identified by the PAVN-VC were initially marched out of the city for \\"reeducation\\", few returned. Those deemed guilty of the most serious \\"crimes\\" were speedily tried and executed. As the PAVN-VC area of control within Hu·∫ø shrank, the pace of executions increased to prevent the \\"enemies of the people\\" being freed by ARVN or U.S. forces or identifying the VC who had revealed themselves. Mark Bowden suggests that PAVN-VC anger at the lack of enthusiasm among the population of Hu·∫ø may have fuelled the purges, particularly as defeat loomed closer. Estimates of Vietnamese civilians killed by the PAVN-VC at Hu·∫ø range from 2,800 (based on bodies exhumed from mass graves) to almost 6,000. According to Mark Bowden, South Vietnamese forces killed 1,000-2,000 people after the battle. Foreign civilians captured in the city received varying treatment. Some were marched north into captivity, while others were executed, including 3 West German doctors, 2 French Benedictine monks and 2 U.S. government employees. French journalists Catherine Leroy and Francois Mazure were captured by the PAVN but allowed to return to U.S. lines bringing photos of the PAVN side of the battle which were subsequently published in Life Magazine. Impact on American public opinion The initial press statements by MACV played down the events in Hu·∫ø, claiming that only a part of the city had fallen to a small enemy force, that the city would soon be fully restored to South Vietnamese Government control and that the main attack would be directed against Khe Sanh. This and subsequent optimistic reports were soon contradicted by press reports as journalists made their way into the city and reported on the extent of PAVN-VC control and the bitter house-to-house fighting that was underway. Walter Cronkite interviews LtCol Gravel On 10 February 1968, CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite visited southern Hu·∫ø to film footage for a special report on the Vietnam War. The \\"Report from Vietnam: Who, What, When, Where, Why?\\" screened on 27 February 1968, Cronkite closed the report with the editorial comments: After watching Cronkite's editorial report, President Lyndon Johnson is purported to have said, \\"If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost Middle America.\\" This account has been questioned in a book on journalistic accuracy. Militarily, Hu·∫ø and the entire Tet Offensive were Allied victories. However, the shock of the Tet Offensive, coming so soon after General William Westmoreland's \\"End in view\\" tour of the U.S. in November 1967, undermined the credibility of Westmoreland and his strategy within the Johnson Administration. Over the coming months U.S. public opinion turned decisively against the war. Analysis Throughout the entire battle the U.S. command consistently underestimated the size of the PAVN-VC forces engaged and the Allied forces necessary to deal with them. Initially forces were identified as coming from the PAVN 4th, 5th and 6th Regiments. Additional battalions were later identified as coming from the 29th Regiment of the 325C Division, the 90th and 803rd Regiments of the 324B Division and the 24th Regiment of the 304th Division, three of these Regiments were believed to be involved in the siege of Khe Sanh. Allied intelligence estimated that 16‚Äì18 PAVN Battalions totaling 8‚Äì11,000 soldiers were engaged in the battle. Allied air and artillery support was restricted by the poor weather, supply difficulties and, initially, by restrictions intended to limit damage to Hu·∫ø's historic structures. While PAVN-VC defeat was inevitable in the face of U.S. firepower, the failure to sever the PAVN-VC supply lines and isolate the battlefield meant that the battle lasted longer and was more costly to the ARVN and U.S. than was necessary. Until the last week of the battle the ARVN, U.S. Marines and 1st Cavalry each fought separate, largely uncoordinated battles without a unified command structure, no overall strategy and competing demands for logistics, air and artillery support. Delaying the counterattack until a clear strategy was developed and the necessary forces assembled might have reduced casualties among the ARVN, U.S. forces and civilians and shortened the battle. The battle was an ARVN-U.S. victory in only the narrowest sense in that they had evicted the PAVN-VC from the city at heavy cost but failed to annihilate them. The PAVN-VC failed to hold the city or spark a general uprising, but they had undermined confidence in the Thi·ªáu-K·ª≥ Government and the prospect of victory. Unplanned by the North Vietnamese, their greatest success was the shock and negative impact of the battle and the entire Tet Offensive on U.S. public opinion. PAVN General Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Tr√† later wrote of the Tet Offensive \\"We did not correctly evaluate the specific balance of forces between ourselves and the enemy... [its objectives] were beyond our actual strength...in part an illusion based on our subjective desires.\\" 3rd Battalion 5th Marines seize apartments at the edge of Fallujah in November 2004 The November 2004 anti- insurgent Marine operation in the city of Fallujah that took place during the Iraq War, has been compared to the Battle of Hu·∫ø. Both battles were fought in close quarters in an urban setting where the enemy ensconced itself in the midst of civilians. In Fallujah, Sunni insurgents turned mosques into fortresses, in a similar way to how PAVN-VC forces utilized Buddhist temples in Hu·∫ø. Both battles also had insurgents and other forces utilizing snipers, significantly increasing the combat potential of the combatants, while the Marines also constituted the advanced fighting elements of the US forces deployed in both Hu·∫ø and Fallujah. In his analysis of the Battle of Fallujah, Jonathan F. Keiler, a military historian and former officer in the Judge Advocate General's Corps wrote: > The Marine Corps' military operations in urban terrain doctrine recognizes > that tactical success does not necessarily translate to strategic victory... > the Battle of Hu·∫ø in the Vietnam War, when Marines defeated an enemy that > sought to put up a good fight but never expected to win. Much the same can > be said of Fallujah's defenders. In spite of the beating they took in > November, they will continue to assert they repelled the initial attack and > fought well thereafter.

He studied at the Lyceum and abroad, also serving at the French Military academy. Upon return to Malta, he had a career in business in the tobacco industry, up to being appointed director of Cousis Cigarettes. From 1914 to 1925 he served as consul of Japan in Malta and President of the Chamber of Commerce. He also chaired the Societ√† dell'Arte, Manifattura e Commercio and La Societ√† Filarmonica La Valette. In 1912 Malta's Comitato Patriottico appointed him as member of the Council of Government. He chaired the Government emigration committee, and in 1919 headed the delegation which discussed the employment of Maltese emigrants with the French authorities. At the 1921 elections Howard joined Msg. Ignazio Panzavecchia's Maltese Political Union (Unjoni Politika Maltija, UPM) and was elected Senator in the first Maltese Parliament. With 14 seats, UPM was the first party, but short of a majority. Governor Lord Plumer offered the premiership to Howard, as Panzavecchia could not accept it. Howard led the first autonomous Maltese government from 1921 to 1923 with the support of the Malta Labour Party, which held 7 seats. According to Rudolf, the appointment of Howard was deemed unusual, as he held personal views closer to the rival Constitutional Party, which also held 7 seats.Uwe Jens Rudolf, Historical Dictionary of Malta As a first act in government, Howard proclaimed Roman Catholicism as the official religion of the country (Religion of Malta Declaration Act). His capacity to conduct politics were linked to his administrative experience and sense of tolerance, being seen as a true gentleman. Howard was also made Officer of the British Empire (OBE). He died aged 63 in 1925. During his premiership mandate, Joseph Muscat paid yearly tribute to Howard on the day of his birth from 2015 to 2018.2015, 2016, 2018 The green areas separating Mdina from Rabat have been named Howard Gardens.Maltese gardens See also *Prime Minister of Malta *List of Prime Ministers of Malta References Category:1862 births Category:1925 deaths Category:Prime Ministers of Malta Category:Maltese Political Union politicians Category:People from Valletta Category:20th- century Maltese politicians ","title":"Joseph Howard (Prime Minister)"},{"id":"6664689","title":"EndNote"},{"id":"6664691","text":"Kru, KRU may refer to: * Kanchanaburi Rajabhat University (KRU) *Kru people, ethnic group in Liberia and C√¥te d'Ivoire *Kru languages, the group of dialects spoken by the Kru of Liberia and C√¥te d'Ivoire *KRU, Malaysian boy band *KRU Interactive, a gaming company *Kru (fictional character), in the film Chang: A Drama of the Wilderness * Korea Rugby Union *Kuzbassrazrezugol, a Russian coal-mining company.

Laccases oxidize a variety of phenolic substrates, performing one-electron oxidations, leading to crosslinking. For example, laccases play a role in the formation of lignin by promoting the oxidative coupling of monolignols, a family of naturally occurring phenols. Other laccases, such as those produced by the fungus Pleurotus ostreatus, play a role in the degradation of lignin, and can therefore be classed as lignin-modifying enzymes. Other laccases produced by fungi can facilitate the biosynthesis of melanin pigments. Laccases catalyze ring cleavage of aromatic compounds. Laccase was first studied by Hikorokuro Yoshida in 1883 and then by Gabriel Bertrand in 1894 in the sap of the Japanese lacquer tree, where it helps to form lacquer, hence the name laccase. Active site The tricopper site found in many laccases, notice that each copper center is bound to the imidazole sidechains of histidine (color code: copper is brown, nitrogen is blue). The active site consists of four copper centers, which adopt structures classified as type I, type II, and type III. A tricopper ensemble contains types II and III copper (see figure). It is this center that binds O2 and reduces it to water. Each Cu(I,II) couple delivers one electron required for this conversion. The type 1 copper does not bind O2, but functions solely as an electron transfer site. The type I copper center consists of a single copper atom that is ligated to a minimum of two histidine residues and a single cysteine residue, but in some laccases produced by certain plants and bacteria, the type I copper center contains an additional methionine ligand. The type III copper center consists of two copper atoms that each possess three histidine ligands and are linked to one another via a hydroxide bridging ligand. The final copper center is the type II copper center, which has two histidine ligands and a hydroxide ligand. The type II together with the type III copper center forms the tricoppper ensemble, which is where dioxygen reduction takes place. The type III copper can be replaced by Hg(II), which causes a decrease in laccase activity. Cyanide removes all copper from the enzyme, and re-embedding with type I and type II copper has been shown to be impossible. Type III copper, however, can be re-embedded back into the enzyme. A variety of other anions inhibit laccase. Laccases affects the oxygen reduction reaction at low overpotentials. The enzyme has been examined as the cathode in enzymatic biofuel cells. They can be paired with an electron mediator to facilitate electron transfer to a solid electrode wire. Laccases are some of the few oxidoreductases commercialized as industrial catalysts. Activity in wheat dough Laccases have the potential to cross link food polymers such as proteins and nonstarch polysaccharides in dough. In non starch polysaccharides, such as arabinoxylans (AX), laccase catalyzes the oxidative gelation of feruloylated arabinoxylans by dimerization of their ferulic esters. These cross links have been found to greatly increased the maximum resistance and decreased extensibility of the dough. The resistance was increased due to the crosslinking of AX via ferulic acid and resulting in a strong AX and gluten network. Although laccase is known to cross link AX, under the microscope it was found that the laccase also acted on the flour proteins. Oxidation of the ferulic acid on AX to form ferulic acid radicals increased the oxidation rate of free SH groups on the gluten proteins and thus influenced the formation of S-S bonds between gluten polymers. Laccase is also able to oxidize peptide bound tyrosine, but very poorly. Because of the increased strength of the dough, it showed irregular bubble formation during proofing. This was a result of the gas (carbon dioxide) becoming trapped within the crust and could not diffuse out (like it would have normally) and causing abnormal pore size. Resistance and extensibility was a function of dosage, but at very high dosage the dough showed contradictory results: maximum resistance was reduced drastically. The high dosage may have caused extreme changes in structure of dough, resulting in incomplete gluten formation. Another reason is that it may mimic overmixing, causing negative effects on gluten structure. Laccase treated dough had low stability over prolonged storage. The dough became softer and this is related to laccase mediation. The laccase mediated radical mechanism creates secondary reactions of FA-dervived radicals that result in breaking of covalent linkages in AX and weakening of the AX gel. Biotechnology The ability of laccases to degrade various aromatic polymers has led to research into their potential for bioremediation and other industrial applications. Studies utilizing both fungal and bacterial laccases have determined that these enzymes are capable of degrading and detoxifying various synthetic compounds, including azo dyes, bisphenol A and pharmaceuticals.

Story The Third Man is a 1949 British film noir, directed by Carol Reed. One night after a long day of filming The Third Man on location in Vienna, Reed and cast members Joseph Cotten, Alida Valli and Orson Welles had dinner and retired to a wine cellar. In the bistro, which retained the atmosphere of the pre-war days, they heard the zither music of Anton Karas, a 40-year-old musician who was playing there just for the tips. Reed immediately realized that this was the music he wanted for his film. Karas spoke only German, which no one in Reed's party spoke, but fellow customers translated Reed's offer to the musician that he compose and perform the soundtrack for The Third Man. Karas was reluctant since it meant traveling to England, but he finally accepted. Karas wrote and recorded the 40 minutes of music heard in The Third Man over a six-week period, after the entire film was translated for him at Shepperton Studios.Brady, Frank, Citizen Welles: A Biography of Orson Welles.

Biography In 1982, he moved to Kazakhstan with his parents and learnt to play chess a year later. A winner of the Kazakhstani Youth Championship in 1985, he went on to represent Kazakhstan at the 1992 Chess Olympiad in Manila and was twice the national champion. International Master and Grandmaster titles were awarded to him in 1993 and 1996 respectively. Now living in Cannes, Tkachiev has taken French citizenship and won the 2006 French Chess Championship, held at Besan√ßon, August 14‚Äì26.Championnats de France His victory included a rapid play-off win against Laurent Fressinet. In 2007, he won the European Individual Chess Championship, held in Dresden, following a play-off with GMs Emil Sutovsky, Dmitry Jakovenko and Ivan Cheparinov. He also reached the semi-finals of the Russian Chess Championship in 2005 and won the Moscow Blitz Superfinal in 2004, ahead of Alexander Morozevich. Other victories include Oakham 1993, Cannes 1996 (and 1999), Isle of Man 1996 and Makarska 1997. In matchplay, he has defeated Alberto David 6-2 (+4=4) in 1999 and beat Dutch grandmaster John van der Wiel by 7-3 (+5=4-1). In 2000, his (Cannes) match against Jeroen Piket ended in a 4-4 draw (+2=4-2). In 2013 Tkachiev won the Nancy stage of the French Rapid Grand Prix. Tkachiev admits leading a racy‚Äîif not hedonistic‚Äîlifestyle and to finding it difficult to cope with lengthy tournaments at long time controls. His passion is therefore for blitz chess and this appears also to be his real strength. In September 2009, Tkachiev caused controversy after falling asleep during a match at an international tournament in Calcutta, India. He was reportedly intoxicated and, after passing out repeatedly during the first hour of play, was forced to forfeit the game after eleven moves on technical grounds.Maverick chess master Vladislav Tkachiev falls asleep at the board Notable games *Viswanathan Anand vs Vladislav Tkachiev, FIDE WCh KO 2001, Spanish Game: Morphy Defense (C78), 1/2-1/2 *Alexander Morozevich vs Vladislav Tkachiev, World Cup of Rapid Chess Gp B 2001, Scotch Game: Classical, Intermezzo Variation (C45), 0-1 *Evgeny E Vorobiov vs Vladislav Tkachiev, 58th Russian Championship Semi- Finals 2005, Scotch Game: Classical, Intermezzo Variation (C45), 0-1 *Vladislav Tkachiev vs Maxime Vachier Lagrave, French Championships 2006, English Opening: Anglo-Indian Defense.

With the intention of promoting chess worldwide and attracting the interest of media and sponsors, Vladislav and his brother Evgeny created a website that hosted the competition. Although the site is currently offline, viewers were able to register to see the full size images and vote for their favourites. Whilst the contest was controversial in some quarters and considered to be degrading by some female chess players, the not-too-revealing photographs were mostly sent in by the participants themselves. A judging panel was made up of a wider selection of chess grandmasters, including Nigel Short, who along with some women players like Jennifer Shahade, supported the idea behind the venture. Amongst the more noted chess players featured in the contest were Natalija Pogonina, Maria Manakova, Almira Skripchenko and Elisabeth P√§htz.

During a career spanning a large part of the 20th century and ending in 1971 Warburg published Orwell's Animal Farm (1945) as well as Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949), and works by other leading figures such as Thomas Mann and Franz Kafka. Other notable publications included The Third Eye by Lobsang Rampa, Pierre Boulle's The Bridge over the River Kwai, Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf and William Shirer's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. Life Warburg was born on 27 November 1898 in Paddington, London, to John Cimon Warburg (1867, London ‚Äì 1931, London), a photographer, and his wife Violet Amalia (1868, Melbourne ‚Äì 1925, London) (n√©e Sichel), both of Jewish descent. John Cimon was the oldest son of Fredric Elias Warburg (1832, Gothenburg, Sweden ‚Äì 1899, London) and Emma (1844‚Äì1925) (n√©e Raphael). At the age of nine, Fredric Warburg was sent to Wilkinson's boys' preparatory school. He later won a scholarship to Westminster School. He recalled his first two years there as \\"among the most hateful of my life\\".Fredric Warburg, An Occupation for Gentlemen, London: Hutchinson, 1959, p. 30. While he excelled academically, as a Jew he often felt an outsider. He found refuge and solace in his love of books. In summer 1917, Warburg was commissioned to serve as an officer in the Royal Artillery. He was stationed in the Ypres area until the end of the war. After the war he began studying chemistry at Christ Church, Oxford, but later switched to classics and philosophy, receiving his MA in 1922. Warburg's first marriage (5 July 1922), to May Nellie Holt (born 20 May 1902, Hampstead, North West London), produced three sons: David (born 22 August 1923 died 10 November 1987), Hew Francis (born 8 April 1925, died 10 April 1983) and Jeremy Fredric (14 October 1928 - 9 June 1986). The marriage ended in divorce in 1932, and on 21 January 1933 Warburg married the painter and designer Pamela Bryer (n√©e de Bayou, widowed) (20 March 1905 - 1978). They had a son who died of a brain haemorrhage within 24 hours of his birth, on 13 March 1933. During the Second World War, Warburg served as a corporal in the Home Guard, in the same section in which Orwell held the rank of sergeant. Warburg died of heart failure at University College Hospital, London, on 25 May 1981, at the age of 82. Publishing career Warburg started his publishing career in 1922, as an apprentice at Routledge & Sons, where he came under the tutelage of William Swan Stallybrass, a man he regarded as \\"the greatest scholar-publisher of his day\\".Warburg, An Occupation for Gentlemen, p. 121. After Stallybrass died in 1931 Warburg became increasingly dissatisfied with Routledge and in 1935 he was dismissed. Later that year he and Roger Senhouse purchased the publishing firm of Martin Secker, which had gone into receivership, and renamed it Secker & Warburg. The firm became renowned for its independent left-wing position, being both anti-fascist and anti-Communist, which put it at loggerheads with many intellectuals of the time. Among the books the firm published were C. L. R. James's World Revolution, Reg Groves's We Shall Rise Again, Boris Souvarine's Stalin and Andr√© Gide's Back from the USSR.John Newsinger, \\"Orwell and the Spanish Revolution,\\" International Socialism Journal, Issue 62, Spring 1994. When George Orwell parted company with Victor Gollancz over publication of The Road to Wigan Pier it was to Secker & Warburg that he took his next book, Homage to Catalonia. The firm published all of Orwell's books from then on, and he and Warburg became intimate friends. In 1940 Warburg introduced Orwell to another of his firm's authors, T. R. Fyvel and between the three of them they planned the creation of Searchlight Books.John Rodden, ed., The Cambridge Companion to George Orwell, Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 94. With its financial position devastated by paper shortages during and after the war, Secker & Warburg was forced to join the Heinemann publishing group in 1952.Fredric Warburg, All Authors Are Equal, London: Hutchinson, 1973, p. 71. During the 1950s and 1960s Secker & Warburg published books by authors including Simone de Beauvoir, Colette, Alberto Moravia, G√ºnter Grass, Angus Wilson, Melvyn Bragg and Julian Gloag. In 1961 Warburg was made a director of the Heinemann group, a post he retained until his retirement in 1971. He also published two volumes of autobiography: An Occupation for Gentlemen (1959) and All Authors are Equal (1973). Miscellany In 1952 Warburg became a member of the committee of the Society for Cultural Freedom (SCF), an organisation established, in the words of Warburg's friend T. R. Fyvel, to \\"promote western culture and defend it against the Communist culture of the East\\".Warburg, All Authors are Equal, p. 154. The SCF produced a cultural magazine, Encounter, which received sustained criticism in the 1960s when it emerged that much of the money used to produce the magazine had come directly from the CIA, without the knowledge of most of its contributors and supporters, including Warburg. In 1954 Secker & Warburg was prosecuted for obscenity after publishing The Philanderer, a novel by Stanley Kauffmann.The New York Times - Obituaries Warburg was offered the chance to plead guilty and escape with a minimal fine, but opted for trial by jury at the Old Bailey. The book was found not to be obscene and the summary by the presiding judge at the trial, Sir Wintringham Stable, was added as an appendix to later editions of The Philanderer.

Although Forsythe was classified blind at birth he has traveled extensively. He did not start painting until 1991 when his eyesight was restored by an operation. Early life Forsythe was born in Ballymena, County Antrim. In 1958 Forsythe and his family immigrated to Canada. He worked his way through University and graduated with a degree in Political Science from the University of Guelph in Ontario. He completed his formal education in 1974 at the age of 22. Career In 1981 Forsythe started his own business paving roads. His company employed a dozen workers and the work was steady, but Forsythe had a desire to do something more creative. In his spare time Forsythe wrote murder mysteries, perhaps prompted by the fact that his father and his father's brothers were all policemen working in homicide. As a young boy Forsythe would overhear his father speaking about unsolved crimes with colleagues. At the age of 38 Forsythe was told that an operation might be able to give him sight. Despite the risk of complications, Forsythe chose to undergo the operation. Fortunately, the operation was a success and Forsythe could see properly for the first time.

Smith (1921‚Äì2004) served as the 13th president of Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, USA, from 1969 to 1979. Smith came to Lawrence from Ohio University, where he had spent two years as provost, assuming the president‚Äôs office on July 1, 1969. He presided over the college until his retirement on August 31, 1979. He led the college during one of the more difficult periods in its recent history. Student unrest over Vietnam and civil rights activism, as well as pressure from the student body for more of a voice in matters of academic and student life required delicate but decisive leadership. When Smith arrived on campus in 1969, his first faculty meeting was disrupted by students protesting U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. During the 1970s, the college, along with American higher education in general, faced an extended period of fiscal austerity, necessitating difficult decisions and the retrenchment of faculty, staff, and administration. Among the milestones of his presidency were the completion of a major capital campaign; the opening of the Seeley G. Mudd Library in 1975; the strengthening of the university endowment; an extensive administrative reorganization involving academic affairs, admissions, development and student life; improvements in the curriculum and the renovations of Sage and Ormsby Halls. \\"Tom was a quiet and unassuming man, yet forceful and straightforward in his dealings and interactions with others,\\" recalled Richard Warch, who succeeded Smith as Lawrence president in 1979. \\"I had the privilege of serving with him for the last two years of his tenure (as vice president of academic affairs) and counted him a friend and mentor and admired him as a man of principle and honor.\\" In 1972, President Richard Nixon appointed Smith to the President's Committee on the National Medal of Science, the selection committee for the prestigious awards for distinguished contributions in physical, biological, mathematics, or engineering sciences. The following year, Wisconsin Governor Patrick Lucey appointed Smith chairman of the newly created State Ethics Board, a position he still held when he left Lawrence. Smith also served on the boards of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities and Independent College Funds of America, Inc. After leaving Lawrence, Smith served as executive director of the Lakeshore Consortium in Support of the Arts, an organization promoting increased awareness of, participation in, and contributions to an enhanced environment for arts activities in the Fox River Valley. He maintained a commitment to liberal education in retirement remaining active with the Waupaca-based Winchester Academy, encouraging it to foster its historic focus on the liberal arts and sciences and music. Born February 8, 1921, Smith was one of 10 children‚Äîfive of whom survived infancy‚Äîborn to a Hubbard, Ohio steelworker and his wife. He attended Kenyon College on a full tuition scholarship and graduated magna cum laude in 1947, earning a bachelor of arts degree in physics. He earned a Ph.D. in physics at Ohio State University in 1952. Later that same year, Smith began his academic career as an assistant professor of physics at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. In 1961, he was appointed an assistant to the president of Ohio University. From 1962 to 1967, he served as vice president for academic affairs and was named provost in 1967.

Cardinal Giovanni Carlo dei Medici, engraving by Adriaen Haelwegh, before 1691, from the collection of the National Gallery of Art De' Medici was raised to the cardinalate by Pope Paul V in the consistory of 2 December 1615 and was made Cardinal Deacon of Santa Maria in Domnica. He was an elector at the papal conclaves of 1621 and 1623 that elected Pope Gregory XV and Pope Urban VIII. He transferred deaconries to that of San Nicola in Carcere in 1623, and was the Cardinal protodeacon at the conclave of 1644 that elected Pope Innocent X. He was briefly Cardinal Deacon of Sant'Eustachio, before being raised to the order of Cardinal Priests in December 1644, with the title of San Sisto. The next year, de' Medici was raised to Cardinal Bishop of Sabina, but opted for the suburbicarian see of Frascati seven months later. On 29 April 1652 he was made Cardinal Bishop of Porto e Santa Rufina and Vice- Dean of the College of Cardinals.

The concept arose in landscape architect Ian McHarg's 1969 manifesto Design With Nature in which the modern landscape is compared to that on which ancient people once lived. The concept was then considered by the fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly in his paper \\"Anecdotes and the shifting baseline syndrome of fisheries\\".Pauly (1995) Pauly developed the concept in reference to fisheries management where fisheries scientists sometimes fail to identify the correct \\"baseline\\" population size (e.g. how abundant a fish species population was before human exploitation) and thus work with a shifted baseline. He describes the way that radically depleted fisheries were evaluated by experts who used the state of the fishery at the start of their careers as the baseline, rather than the fishery in its untouched state. Areas that swarmed with a particular species hundreds of years ago, may have experienced long term decline, but it is the level of decades previously that is considered the appropriate reference point for current populations. In this way large declines in ecosystems or species over long periods of time were, and are, masked. There is a loss of perception of change that occurs when each generation redefines what is \\"natural\\". Most modern fisheries' stock assessments do not ignore historical fishing and account for it by either including the historical catch or use other techniques to reconstruct the depletion level of the population at the start of the period for which adequate data is available. Anecdotes about historical populations levels can be highly unreliable and result in severe mismanagement of the fishery. The concept was further refined and applied to the ecology of kelp forests by Paul Dayton and others from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. They used a slightly different version of the term in their paper, \\"Sliding baselines, ghosts, and reduced expectations in kelp forest communities\\".Dayton (1998) Both terms refer to a shift over time in the expectation of what a healthy ecosystem baseline looks like. Broadened meaning In 2002, filmmaker and former marine biologist Randy Olson broadened the definition of shifting baselines with an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times. He explained the relevance of the concept to all aspects of change and the failure to notice change in the world today. He and coral reef ecologist Jeremy Jackson (of Scripps Institution of Oceanography) co-founded The Shifting Baselines Ocean Media Project in 2003 to help promote a wider understanding and use of the concept in conservation policy. The Shifting Baselines Ocean Media Project grew from its three founding partners (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, The Ocean Conservancy, and Surfrider Foundation) to over twenty conservation groups and science organizations. The project has produced dozens of short films, public service announcements, and Flash videos along with photography, video, and stand-up comedy contests, all intended to promote the term to a broader audience. The Shifting Baselines Blog, \\"the cure for planetary amnesia\\" is run by the Shifting Baselines Ocean Media Project on the Seed (magazine) Science Blogs.

The service has been in operation since 1914, except from 1946 to 1953. The specific vessel used has been replaced and updated several times, most recently in 1997. It is one of three remaining ferries on the Willamette River. The ferry has room for six cars (or 75 tons) and a total passenger capacity of 49. A toll is charged for all crossings. As of July 2017, a passenger car costs $5.00, a motorcycle, bicycle, or pedestrian $2.00, and $30.00 is charged if a vehicle takes up the entire ferry. The vessel currently used, the M.J. Lee II, is a cable-guided vessel powered by electricity provided by overhead lines and is guided across the river by an underwater cable in diameter, leaving the vessel relatively unaffected by the river's currents. Canby Ferry Restricted Maneuverability Day Shape The ferry is required by the Navigation Rules to display a day shape and, at night, certain lights that communicate to other vessels its (right-of- way) rights on navigable waters.US Dept of Transportation, United States Coast Guard \\"Navigation Rules, International-Inland\\", COMDTINST M16672.2D, Paradise Cay Publications, Arcata, California Because the ferry is guided by an underwater cable, and is fed electricity from an overhead cable, its ability to maneuver is restricted. Such vessels must display the day shape for restricted maneuverability which is a ball, diamond, and ball displayed vertically in the rigging. As the Canby Ferry is permanently with restricted maneuverability, the shipbuilders mounted a metal ball-diamond-ball on a mast. Before sunrise and after sunset, and during periods of restricted visibility, the ferry must display the red over white over red array of a vessel restricted in ability to maneuver. The ferry is named after Millard Jerome Lee, the first child born in Canby. Lee was born in 1872, two years after the town was platted in 1870. The vessel currently in use, M.J. Lee II, has been providing the service since 1997. In 2013, operation of the ferry was suspended from January to July, to allow major maintenance work to be carried out. The work included retrofitting the vessel with a new propulsion equipment that is quieter and more energy-efficient ‚Äì using less electricity ‚Äì than previously.

He is best known for the arrest of gunman Tom Horn in 1903 for the alleged murder of 14‚Äëyear-old sheepherder Willie Nickell, which has since come into question, and it has long been believed that Lefors falsified evidence helping to convict the wrong man for the murder. Lefors was featured as a character in the 1969 film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Family Lefors was born in Paris, Texas, to James J. Lefors and Mahala West. His brothers Sam, Ike, Rufe, and Newton were all peace officers in some capacity. Newton was killed in the line of duty serving as a Deputy U.S. Marshal in Indian Territory. http://names.lawmemorial.org/officers/l/newton- leforce.html The town of Lefors, Texas is named for another brother, Perry. Law enforcement career Lefors first arrived in Wyoming in 1885 after working on a cattle drive that ended there. He played a minor role in the 1887 recovery of a large herd of cattle rustled by the Hole in the Wall Gang. He later worked as a Contract Livestock Inspector for Wyoming, where his job was to recover stolen livestock and apprehend cattle thieves. Lefors married his first wife, 16‚Äëyear‚Äëold Bessie M. Hannum, in Newcastle, Wyoming on August 5, 1896. In 1899, Lefors took part in a posse to capture those responsible for what would become known as the \\"Wilcox Train Robbery\\", committed by the Hole in the Wall Gang led by outlaw Butch Cassidy. The robbers eventually escaped into the Big Horn Mountains. Famed lawman and Pinkerton agent Charlie Siringo worked heavily on that case, and would years later come into contact with Lefors in the process of working other cases, and would later indicate that Lefors was incompetent, at best, as a lawman. However, US Marshal Frank Hadsell appointed Lefors a Deputy US Marshal in October 1899. Lefors always claimed that Hadsell approached him to take that job based on his hard work on the Wilcox Robbery case. However, Lefors contributed to that case very little, if anything, and is not mentioned as a contributor at all in the official records of that investigation. It is more likely that Lefors asked Hadsell to give him the appointment, and eventually he asked often enough to get it.Tom Horn's Story ‚Äì A Confession? at www.tom-horn.com Train robbers again robbed another Union Pacific train on August 29, 1900, near Tipton, Wyoming about fifty miles west of Rawlins, and this time Lefors led the posse. However, they again had no success, and the robbers escaped. That same year, former lawman, scout, tracker and longtime killer for hire Tom Horn began his investigation on the Wilcox robbery case, working on contract with the Pinkerton Detective Agency to solve the case, and with whom he had been employed many years before. He generated productive information which was later passed to Charlie Siringo via the agency, obtained from explosives expert Bill Speck. Through that information, the investigators were able to identify who had killed Sheriff Josiah Hazen, who had been killed during a chase of the train robbery suspects.

He was known to brag to others about his achievements, though his effectiveness as a law enforcement official was disputed. In a January 1, 1902, letter to W.D. Smith in Helena, Montana, of the \\"Iron Mountain Ranch Company\\", Lefors discussed the prospect of infiltrating a gang, though on behalf of the cattle company, rather than law enforcement. Smith asked Lefors to recommend someone for the job, which paid a salary of $125 per month, to which Lefors recommended himself, citing his successful defeat of \\"Brown's Hole Gang\\" as credentials. In fact, Lefors had been unsuccessful in stopping the activities of the \\"Brown's Hole Gang\\". Following the hanging of Horn, Lefors took the job offered in Helena, working there for many months, without success in countering the gang. He was fired in 1904, and little is known about his whereabouts after that. He started working on an autobiography in 1935, called Wyoming Peace Officer.

Early years Whitworth, the eldest of the three sons (there were also four daughters) and heir of Sir Charles Whitworth, MP (a nephew of The 1st Baron Whitworth), was born at Leybourne Grange, Kent, on 19 May 1752 and baptised there on 29 May 1752. He was educated at Tonbridge School, his preceptors there including James Cawthorn and \\"Mr. Towers\\".Tonbridge School Register, 1886, p. 13 He entered the first regiment of footguards in April 1772 as ensign, became captain in May 1781, and was eventually on 8 April 1783 appointed lieutenant-colonel of the 104th regiment. His transference from military life to diplomacy is not easy to explain, but in the account given by Wraxall,Memoirs, 1772‚Äì1784, 1884 disfigured though it is by malicious or purely fanciful embroidery, there is perhaps a nucleus of truth. Whitworth was The good offices of the queen and Dorset, according to this authority, procured for Whitworth in June 1785 his appointment as envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary to Poland, of which country the unfortunate Stanis≈Çaw Poniatowski was still the nominal monarch. He was at Warsaw during the troubled period immediately preceding the second partition. Recalled early in 1788, he was in the following August nominated envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary at St. Petersburg, a post which he held for nearly twelve years. Envoy-Extraordinary and Minister-Plenipotentiary at St. Petersburg Plenipotentiaries of Britain, Holland, Prussia and Russia signing the Treaty of 1791Plenipotentiaries of Britain, Holland, Prussia and Russia signing the Treaty of 1791 by Edward Dayes, now in the National Portrait Gallery. Whitworth was well received by Catherine II, who was then at war with Turkey, but the harmony between the two countries was disturbed during the winter of 1790‚Äì1 by William Pitt's subscription to the view of the Prussian government that the three allies (Britain, Prussia and the Netherlands) could not with impunity allow the balance of power in Eastern Europe to be disturbed. Pitt hoped by a menace of sending a British fleet to the Baltic to constrain Russia to make restitution of its chief conquest, Oczakow and the adjoining territory as far as the Dniester, and thus to realise his idea of confining the ambition of Russia in the south-east as well as that of France in the north-west portion of Europe. The Russian government replied by an uncompromising refusal to listen to the proposal of restitution. War began to be talked of, and Whitworth sent in a memorandum in which he dwelt upon the strength of the czarina's determination and the great display of vigour that would be necessary to overcome it. In the spring of 1791 he wrote of a French adventurer, named St. Ginier, who had appeared at St. Petersburg with a plan for invading Bengal by way of Kashmir, and in July he communicated to Grenville a circumstantial account of a plot to burn the English fleet at Portsmouth by means of Irish and other incendiaries in Russian pay. In the meantime Pitt had become alarmed at the opposition to his Russian policy in parliament, Burke and Fox both uttering powerful speeches against the restoration of Oczakow to the Porte, and early in April 1791 a messenger was hastily despatched to St. Petersburg to keep back the ultimatum which Whitworth had on 27 March been ordered to present to the empress. His relations with the Russian court were now for a short period considerably strained. Catherine, elated by recent victories of Suvorov, said to him with an ironical smile: \\"Sir, since the king your master is determined to drive me out of Petersburg, I hope he will permit me to retire to Constantinople\\".William Tooke, Life of Catharine II, iii. 284 Gradually, however, through the influence of Madame Gerepzof, the sister of the favourite, the celebrated Zubof, and in consequence of the alarm excited in the mind of Catherine by the course things were taking in France, Whitworth more than recovered his position. Great Britain's influence upon the peace finally concluded at the Treaty of Jassy on 9 January 1792 was, it is true, little more than nominal, but Whitworth obtained some credit for the achievement, together with the cross of a KB (17 November 1793). Wraxall's statement that the relations between Whitworth and Madame Gerepzof were similar to those between Marlborough and the Duchess of Cleveland is utterly incredible.Quarterly Review, December 1836, p. 470 The gradual rapprochement between the views of Russia and England was brought about mainly by the common dread of any revolutionary infection from the quarter of France, and in February 1795 Catherine was induced to sign a preliminary treaty, by the terms of which she was to furnish the coalition with at least sixty-five thousand men in return for a large monthly subsidy from the British government. This treaty was justly regarded as a triumph for Whitworth's diplomacy, though, unfortunately, just before the date fixed for its final ratification by both countries, the czarina was struck down by mortal illness (November 1796). Paul I, in his desire to adopt an original policy, refused to affix his signature, and it was not until June 1798 that the outrage committed by the French upon the order of the knights of St. John at Malta, who had chosen him for their protector, disposed him to listen to the solicitations of Whitworth. The latter obtained his adhesion to an alliance with Great Britain offensive and defensive, with the object of putting a stop to the further encroachments of France, in December 1798, and the treaty paved the way for the operations of Suvarof and Korsakof in Northern Italy and the Alps. Whitworth was now at the zenith of his popularity in St. Petersburg, and Paul pressed the British government to raise him to the peerage. The request was readily complied with, and on 21 March 1800 the ambassador was made Baron Whitworth, of Newport Pratt in the County of Mayo, in the Peerage of Ireland; but before the patent could reach him the czar had been reconciled to Napoleon. Irritated, moreover, by the British seizure and retention of Malta, Paul abruptly dismissed Whitworth, and thereupon commenced that angry correspondence which developed into the combination of northern powers against Great Britain. Interlude in Denmark In July 1800 the seizure by and a British squadron of the Danish frigate Freya and her convoy for opposing the British right of search led to strained relations with Denmark. In order to anticipate any hostile move from Danes, the British government despatched Whitworth in August on a special mission to Copenhagen. To give greater weight to his representations, a squadron of nine sail of the line, with five frigates and four bomb vessels, was ordered to the Sound under Admiral Archibald Dickson. The Danish shore batteries were as yet very incomplete, and Whitworth's arguments for the time being proved effectual. He returned to England on 27 September, and on 5 November was made a Privy Councillor. Marriage His former friend, John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset, had died in July 1799, and on 7 April 1801 he married the widow Duchess Arabella Diana (daughter of Sir Charles Cope, Bt., by Catharine, fifth daughter of Cecil Bisshop, bart., of Parham, who afterwards married Lord Liverpool). She was a capable woman of thirty-two, with a taste for power and pleasure, says Wraxall, kept \\"always subordinate to her economy\\". By the death of the Duke she came into possession of ¬£13,000 a year, besides the borough of East Grinstead, while Dorset House and Knole Park subsequently passed into her hands. Ambassador at Paris The Treaty of Amiens was concluded on 27 March 1802, and Whitworth, whose means were now fully adequate to the situation, was chosen to fill the important post of ambassador at Paris. His instructions were dated 10 September 1802, and two months later he set out with a large train, being received at Calais with enthusiasm; a considerable period had elapsed since a British ambassador had been seen in France. He was presented to Napoleon and Mme. Bonaparte on 7 December, and six days later his wife was received at St. Cloud. The duchess, whose hauteur was very pronounced, had considerable scruples about calling upon the wife of Talleyrand. As early as 23 December Whitworth mentions in a despatch the rumour that the first consul was meditating a divorce from his wife and the assumption of the imperial title, but during his first two months' sojourn in Paris there seemed a tacit agreement to avoid disagreeable subjects. Napoleon ignored the attacks of the English press, the retention of Malta, and the protracted evacuation of Egypt, while England kept silence as to the recent French aggressions in Holland, Piedmont, Elba, Parma, and Switzerland. The British government was, however, obstinate in its refusal to quit Malta until a guarantee had been signed by the various powers ensuring the possession of the island to the knights of St. John. This difficulty, which constituted the darkest cloud on the diplomatic horizon, was first raised by Talleyrand on 27 January 1803. Three days later was published a report filling eight pages of the Moniteur from Colonel Sebastiani, who had been sent by Napoleon upon a special mission of inquiry to Egypt. In this report military information was freely interspersed with remarks disparaging to England, in which country the document was plausibly interpreted as a preface to a second invasion of Egypt by the French. The Addington ministry consequently instructed Whitworth, through the foreign minister Hawkesbury, to stiffen his back against any demand for the prompt evacuation of Malta. On 18 Feb Napoleon summoned the ambassador, and, after a stormy outburst of rhetoric, concluded with the memorable appeal, \\"Unissons- nous plut√¥t que de nous combattre, et nous r√©glerons ensemble les destin√©es du monde.\\" Any significance that this offer might have had was more than neutralised by the first consul's observation, \\"Ce sont des bagatelles\\" (much commented upon in England), when, in answer to reproaches about Malta, Whitworth hinted at the augmentation of French power in Piedmont, Switzerland, and elsewhere. In Maniac-Ravings‚Äîor‚ÄîLittle Boney in a strong Fit (1803), James Gillray caricatured Napoleon's tirade to Whitworth at the Tuileries on 13 March 1803. The crisis, of extreme importance in the career of Napoleon (\\"il √©tait arriv√©,\\" says Lanfrey, \\"√† l'instant le plus critique de sa carri√®re\\") as well as in the history of England, was arrived at on 13 March 1803, the date of the famous scene between Napoleon and the British ambassador at the Tuileries. At the close of a violent tirade before a full court, interrupted by asides to foreign diplomatists expressive of the bad faith of the British, Napoleon exclaimed loudly to Whitworth, \\"Malheur √† ceux qui ne respectent pas les trait√©s. Ils en seront responsables √† toute l'Europe.\\" (\\"Woe to those who do not respect treaties! They will be responsible to all Europe.\\") \\"He was too agitated,\\" says the ambassador, \\"to prolong the conversation; I therefore made no answer, and he retired to his apartment repeating the last phrase.\\" Two hundred people heard this conversation (\\"if such it can be called\\"), \\"and I am persuaded,\\" adds Whitworth, \\"that there was not a single person who did not feel the extreme impropriety of his conduct and the total want of dignity as well as of decency on the occasion.\\" The interview was not, however, a final one (as has often erroneously been stated). Whitworth was received by the first consul once again on 4 April, when the corps diplomatique were kept waiting for an audience for four hours while Napoleon inspected knapsacks. \\"When that ceremony was performed he received us, and I had every reason to be satisfied with his manner towards me\\" (Whitworth to Hawkesbury, 4 April 1803). Napoleon wished to temporise until his preparations were a little more advanced, but the pourparlers henceforth had little real significance. On 1 May an indisposition prevented the ambassador from attending the reception at the Tuileries, on 12 May he demanded his passports, and on 18 May Britain declared war against France. Whitworth reached London on 20 May, having encountered the French ambassador, Andr√©ossy, three days earlier at Dover.Garden, Trait√©s de Paix, viii. 100‚Äì151 Throughout the trying scenes with the first consul, his demeanour was generally admitted to have been marked by a dignity and an impassibilit√© worthy of the best traditions of aristocratic diplomacy. Irritated by his failure to stun him by a display of violence (such as that which had so daunted the Venetian plenipotentiaries before the treaty of Campo Formio), Napoleon did not hesitate to suggest in one of his journals that Whitworth had been privy to the murder of Paul I in Russia. At St. Helena in July 1817 he alluded to him with calmness as \\"habile\\" and \\"adroit\\", but he always maintained that the accepted version of the celebrated interview of 13 March was \\"plein des fausset√©s\\".cf. the account printed in Notes and Queries, 1st ser. v. 313 Later years After his return, not occupying a seat in either house of parliament, Whitworth sank for ten years into comparative insignificance, but in 1813, owing to his wife's connection with Lord Liverpool, he was made on 2 March a Lord of the Bedchamber to George III, and on 3 June was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in succession to the Duke of Richmond, a post which he held until October 1817. In the same month he was created an English peer as Viscount Whitworth, of Adbaston in the County of Stafford. On 2 January 1815 he was promoted to the grand cross of the Bath, and on 25 November was created Baron Adbaston, in the County of Stafford, and Earl Whitworth. After the restoration of the Bourbons in France, which as a political expedient he highly approved, he visited Paris in April 1819 with the Duchess of Dorset and a numerous train. His official capacity was denied, but he was generally deemed to have been charged with a mission of observation. He visited Louis XVIII and the princes, but carefully avoided any interview with the ministers. He revisited Paris in the following October on his way to Naples, where he was received with great distinction, though political significance was again disclaimed for the visit. He returned to England and settled at Knole Park in 1820, his last public appearance being as assistant lord sewer at the coronation of George IV on 19 July 1821. Death Lord Whitworth died without issue at Knole on 13 May 1825, when all his honours became extinct. His will was proved on 30 May by the Duchess of Dorset, his universal legatee, the personalty being sworn under ¬£70,000. The duchess died at Knole on 1 August following, and was buried on 10 August at Withyam, Sussex, twenty-two horsemen following her remains to the grave. Her only son (by her first husband), the fourth Duke of Dorset, having died in 1815 after a fall from his horse, her large property (estimated at ¬£35,000 per annum) was divided between her two sons-in-law, the Earls of Plymouth and De la Warr. \\"Knole in Kent was judiciously bequeathed to the former, he being the richer man of the two, on the express condition that his lordship should expend ¬£6,000. per annum on this favourite residence of the Sackvilles for several centuries\\".Sussex Herald, ap.

It was surrounded by a stone curtain wall and a ditch wide by deep. Buckton is one of the earliest stone castles in North West England and only survives as buried remains overgrown with heather and peat. It was most likely built and demolished in the 12th century. The earliest surviving record of the site dates from 1360, by which time it was lying derelict. The few finds retrieved during archaeological investigations indicate that Buckton Castle may not have been completed. In the 16th century, the site may have been used as a beacon for the Pilgrimage of Grace. During the 18th century, the castle was of interest to treasure hunters following rumours that gold and silver had been discovered at Buckton. The site was used as an anti-aircraft decoy site during the Second World War. Between 1996 and 2010, Buckton Castle was investigated by archaeologists as part of the Tameside Archaeology Survey, first by the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit then the University of Salford's Centre for Applied Archaeology. The project involved community archaeology, and more than 60 volunteers took part. The castle, close to the Buckton Vale Quarry, is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Location Buckton Castle lies above sea level on Buckton Hill, a steep sandstone ridge (). To the south and west are the valleys of the Carr Brook and River Tame respectively. Buckton Vale Quarry is close to the east of the castle, while the town of Stalybridge is about south- west of the site. To the north and north-east of the castle are areas of moorland with heather and peat. The site may have been chosen to allow the castle's garrison to guard the Tame Valley. During the Middle Ages, Buckton Castle was at the eastern end of Cheshire. The county shares its western border with Wales. Both the castle and valley were in the medieval manor of Tintwistle. A manor was a division of land administered by a Lord of the Manor or his representative; in Tintwistle's case, it was part of the larger lordship of Longdendale. Compared to Herefordshire and Shropshire, which were also on the Anglo-Welsh border, Cheshire has far fewer castles per square kilometre. Most of the county's castles are close to the western border where the historically richer parts of Cheshire are concentrated. The county is mostly lowland, and Beeston is the only other castle in the area that rises as prominently above the surrounding landscape. According to the archaeologist Rachel Swallow, hilltop castles in the area, which include Buckton, Beeston, Halton and Mold, are \\"predominantly a symbol of significant offensive and elite personal power in these landscapes\\".

The castle is on a hill above sea level. History =Construction and use= great tower cost ¬£184 to build in the late 12th century. The earliest castles in England typically were constructed from timber, at least when they were first built, as building in stone was more expensive. Paleoenvironmental evidence shows that between the 9th and 11th centuries, the area where Buckton Castle would later be built was cleared of woodland. This left little timber, and may partly explain why stone was used as a building material. It became more common to use stone in 12th-century castles, and Buckton is amongst the earliest masonry castles in North West England. Buckton Castle was probably built in the 12th century and there are three identifiable periods of medieval activity at the site: the initial construction phase, in which the ditch was dug and the curtain wall and gatehouse built; the re-cutting of the ditch and further building work behind the curtain wall; and finally deliberate demolition (slighting). Little datable material has been recovered from the site ‚Äì four sherds of Pennine Gritty Ware broadly date to the late 12th century. As is the case with many castles ‚Äì especially of the 12th century ‚Äì there is no record of how much it cost to build Buckton Castle. Based on comparison to Peveril Castle in Derbyshire, where construction of the great tower in 1175‚Äì1177 cost ¬£184 according to the Pipe Rolls, it is estimated that the work at Buckton would have cost around ¬£100. This was close to the median annual income for a baron in 1200. Partly because of the cost and partly because Cheshire was a palatine county in which the earl had authority over who was permitted to build castles, it is likely that the castle was built by one of the earls of Chester. Compared to other English counties along the Anglo-Welsh border, Cheshire has fewer castles per square kilometre, indicating that the earl may have limited castle building. The construction of the castle may have been prompted by the earls' involvement in the Anarchy, a civil war during King Stephen's reign in the middle of the 12th century, or the Revolt of 1173‚Äì74 against Henry II. During the Anarchy, David I of Scotland gained control of most of northern England, including the parts of Lancashire, prompting the construction of Buckton Castle to serve as a safeguard for Cheshire. After the Anarchy, many castles were slighted to restore England to its state before the conflict, which may explain why Buckton was demolished. Alternatively, it could have been slighted after the Revolt of 1173‚Äì74 to punish the earl of Chester for taking part in a war against the king. While it is likely the earls of Chester built the castle, it is possible it could have been built by William de Neville when he held the lordship of Longdendale under the earl between 1181 and 1186, though he may not have had the financial means to do so. The dearth of artefacts recovered from Buckton Castle and the lack of finely finished stonework indicate that the site was never finished, but the re-cutting of the ditch suggests either an extended period of occupancy or abandonment followed by repairs to the fortifications. =Later history and investigation= Excavation of the stone curtain wall in 2007. The alt=A low stone wall being excavated, with a town in the background. A final season of excavation was carried out by the University of Salford's Centre for Applied Archaeology in 2010. An estate survey from 1360 recorded that \\"there is one ruined castle called Buckeden and of no value\\"; this is the earliest surviving reference to the castle. At the time, the lordship of Longdendale was the property of Edward, the Black Prince, and the castle was derelict. The site of the castle may have been used as a beacon in the 16th century, first during the Pilgrimage of Grace of 1536‚Äì37, and later in the 1580s when the country was under threat of invasion from Spain, particularly with the Spanish Armada in 1588. This usage may have been reprised in 1803 when a beacon hut is recorded near Mossley, a settlement less than a mile west of the castle. In the 18th century, people began treasure hunting at Buckton Castle. While the hunting was largely unsuccessful, in 1767 one such venture discovered a gold necklace and a silver vessel, though these artefacts have since been lost. This prompted the interest of local antiquarians, several of whom visited in the 18th and 19th centuries, often drawing plans of the castle. Since 1924, the castle has been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, which is intended to protect important archaeological sites from change; this was probably to protect the castle from Buckton Vale Quarry as it expanded. During the Second World War Starfish sites were built as decoys for bombing raids. Nine were built around Manchester, including one close to Buckton Castle. At this time a brick hut was built over part of the castle ditch. The Starfish site went out of use in 1943. In the 20th century it was suggested that Buckton Castle may have been an Iron Age hillfort, but a study of hillforts in Cheshire and Lancashire found that Buckton was topographically different from these sites and therefore unlikely to have been built in the Iron Age. Excavation in 1998 demonstrated that the site was medieval, with no sign of earlier activity. The archaeologists D. J. Cathcart King and Leslie Alcock suggested that the castle was a ringwork ‚Äì a type of fortification where earthworks formed an integral part of the defence. This was before excavation established that the first phase of the castle was a curtain wall and the earthworks seen today are the result of the collapse of the structure and accumulation of soil on top. Buckton is now understood to be an enclosure castle, with stone walls forming the key defence. The Tameside Archaeology Survey began in 1990, carried out by the University of Manchester Archaeology Unit with more than ¬£500,000 of funding from Tameside Council; ¬£300,000 of this was directed towards the excavations at Buckton Castle. A topographical survey and trial excavations were carried out in 1996 and 1998 to record the castle earthworks and examine a possible outer bailey. The latter was revealed to be a 20th-century feature, probably related to nearby mining activity. Illegal digging by unknown parties in 1999 and 2002 necessitated remedial work and test pitting. In 2007, full-scale excavations at Buckton Castle began with the aim of establishing the date and history of the site. Across three seasons ‚Äì 2007, 2008, and 2010 ‚Äì trenches were opened across the ditch, the northern entrance, the gap in the circuit of earthworks on the south side, the interior, and the curtain wall. The University of Manchester Archaeological Unit closed in July 2009, and the Tameside Archaeology Survey, along with the work at Buckton Castle, was transferred to the new Centre for Applied Archaeology at the University of Salford. Brian Grimsditch directed the excavations throughout. More than 60 volunteers were involved in the excavations between 2007 and 2010, including people from the Tameside Archaeological Society, the South Trafford Archaeological Group, the South Manchester Archaeological Research Team, and students from several universities. Layout Buckton was a small highland enclosure castle with a sandstone curtain wall; nothing survives above ground. It is roughly oval and measures , covering an area of . The castle is surrounded by a ditch apart from the south-west part where the steep slope of the hill makes the ditch unnecessary. When the ditch was dug some of the material was used to raise the interior of the castle by . Buckton is similar in size to Clitheroe Castle's inner enclosure, which is also oval () and has a curtain wall. Clitheroe was also built on a rocky peak and the small size of its great tower may be due to its naturally defensible position and location in an economically deprived area. Buckton Castle was entered through a gatehouse in the north-west measuring . The east side was occupied by the gate passage and the west by a chamber. Though the structure no longer survives above ground, it was probably at least two storeys tall. Constructed in the 12th century, Buckton's gatehouse was the earliest in North West England, and was one of six stone gatehouses in the region that were built in the 12th or 13th centuries: Buckton, Egremont, Brough, Clitheroe, Carlisle's inner gatehouse, and the Agricola Tower at Chester. They are broadly similar in size, and take the form of a gate passage piercing a single tower with rooms in the floors above. Buckton's gatehouse differs slightly in having the passage offset to one side. In the 1770s, the antiquarian Thomas Percival recorded a well within the castle, close to the south curtain, and walls of buildings inside the castle still standing to a height of . A plan created by the Saddleworth Geological Society in 1842 recorded a ruined structure within the castle's south-east area in addition to the well Percival noted. Trenches in the castle's interior did not reveal the structures on the plans from the 18th and 19th centuries, although the discovery of a posthole indicates there was activity in this area. The gap in the southern part of the curtain wall ‚Äì not evident in the 1842 plan by the Saddleworth Geological Society ‚Äì was probably created in the 19th century. There is a feature resembling a spoil heap, consisting of pieces of sandstone. This may have been a by-product from the construction of the castle. Nothing remains of Buckton Castle above ground today, and until the late 20th century, vegetation obscured the existence of a stone structure.

The primary water supply is a spring vent deep beneath the pool's water surface. Warm Mineral Springs is the only warm water mineral spring in the State of Florida. It is an important geological and archaeological site containing Native American remnants. It functioned as a small natural spa since the 1960s. People travel from all over the world to soak in the mineral-rich waters. It has been reputed to be the fountain of youth sought by Ponce de Leon with healing powers. It was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on November 28, 1977. The springs re- opened for swimming only in 2014. Geology The sinkhole filled with water and surrounded by palm trees Warm Mineral Springs is a sinkhole formed in carbonate rock by the collapse of the roof of a cavern 30,000 years ago. The land surrounding the sinkhole is flat, and about above mean sea level. The circular opening of the sinkhole at the current water level is across. The sinkhole is deep, and is shaped roughly like an hourglass. The opening narrows to across a few meters below the surface of the water. About below the surface the opening widens for a short space, forming a ledge under an overhang. The opening narrows to across at below the surface, and then opens up again, reaching across at the bottom of the sinkhole. Debris from the collapsed roof and sides of the sink, and other material that has fallen into the sink, forms a large cone at the bottom, rising to below the surface of the water.Rupert:1 The environment in Florida during the Pleistocene period was much different than today. Due to the enormous amount of water frozen in ice sheets during the last glacial period, the sea level was at least lower than it is today. Florida had about twice the land area of today, its water table was much lower, and its climate was cooler and much drier. There were few running rivers or springs in the part of Florida that is now above sea level. The few water sources in the interior of Florida were rain-fed lakes and water holes perched on relatively impervious deposits of marl and deep sinkholes partially filled by springs, such as Warm Mineral Springs. The water level in the sinkhole 12,000 years ago was about lower that it is today. Dripstone (stalactites and stalagmites) has formed on the walls of Warm Mineral Springs down to about below the present level of the water, indicating that the water level in the sinkhole was at least low long enough for the dripstone to form.Milanich:38-40Rupert:2Cockrell:64 Although there are many small freshwater springs in the walls of the sinkhole, the primary source is a vent below the surface of the water which discharges an estimated a day of warm [] mineralized water. The water has a high content of dissolved chloride (1,600 to 1,700 milligrams per liter [mg/l]) and hydrogen sulfide (9,200 to 9,600 mg/l), and essentially no dissolved oxygen. The source of the water is uncertain. The water enters the sinkhole at the level from a conduit that extends with several turns to a point from the entrance and below the surface of the water. The conduit has an elliptical shape, about high by wide, for much of its length. At the far end the conduit opens up into two small caverns. Most of the flow appears to enter through the floor of the last cavern. Between and a day overflows from the sinkhole.Rupert:3-5Cockrell:63 History In the late 1950s William Royal and other scuba divers found artifacts and human bones from at least seven individuals in Warm Mineral Springs. A partially burned log found in association with some of the human bones was radiocarbon dated to about 10,000 years ago. If the bones were the same age as the log, then the bones were the oldest known evidence of human occupation in Florida at the time. Bone artifacts recovered in association with the human bones were described as of \\"Archaic period in the Americas- type\\". Apparently, the bones and artifacts were deposited above the water level in the sinkhole at that time. One skull recovered from under sediment about under the present water level in the sinkhole contained organic matter. Hospital medical staff who examined the contents of the skull observed that it looked like a brain. One doctor reported that he could distinguish the cerebellum from pieces of the cerebrum. A section through the material also appeared to show grey and white matter. Tests were consistent with the material being brain matter, but no cellular structure could be observed. The property, which was privately owned, was developed into a spa in the 1960s. Unrestricted access resulted in scuba divers removing human bones and artifacts and stalactites and stalagmites as souvenirs and for sale. Almost all artifacts had been removed from the sinkhole before scientific exploration began. The property owners started restricting access to the sinkhole and trying to prevent looting and vandalism in the 1970s.Cockrell:63, 64-65, 66 Agencies that care for public property are required to inventory archaeological resources and to ensure their protection and preservation in the long term. They employ archeologists, part of whose job it is to catalog and curate artifacts found on that property. Landowners and those having permission to collect from the landowners are less constrained but not entirely free to do whatever they wish. Unmarked graves are protected by law and it is illegal to disturb them except under certain terms of various federal, state and local laws. Wilburn Cockrell, an archaeologist at Florida State University, starting working at Warm Mineral Springs in 1972. This work led to the private owner's protecting the site due to its archaeological significance. Archaeological exploration of the sinkhole paused in 1975, resuming in 1984. Phase II of the project found evidence of tool making by early humans. There is evidence of the Paleo-Indian and Archaic cultures.Cockrell:65 Wilburn Cockrell has described Warm Mineral Springs as the \\"burial ground\\" for the prehistoric residential community at nearby Little Salt Spring. In a 1988 interview Cockrell stated that the remains of more than 20 Paleoindians have been found in the sinkhole, including some radiocarbon dated to 12,000 years ago. The archaeologists also found bones of several Pleistocene animals, including a giant ground sloth, a saber-toothed cat, a horse, and a camelid. Cockrell found an 11,000-year-old human skeleton in a fetal position, apparently placed in a crevice with broken stalactites holding it in place. This may be the oldest known intentional burial in North America. In 1996-1997 a group of diver explorers conducted an underwater survey of the site resulting in the mapping of two warm water vents ~97 degrees F and two cool water vents ~76 degrees F. The group also video taped the site including the source of the deepest warm water vent at the end of a 150 ft. lone cave. Warm Mineral Springs was purchased on December 20, 2010, by Sarasota County and the city of North Port for $5.5 million. Architecture The Cyclorama at Warm Mineral Springs The buildings serving the springs have been attributed to Sarasota School of Architecture architect Jack West and were constructed sometime in the late 1950s. The entry building contains a gift shop, locker rooms, showers, and a restaurant. A separate circular structure dubbed the \\"Cyclorama\\" contains a 226 x 13 ft 360-degree mural, with some 3-D figures, depicting nine scenes of Ponce de Leon's arrival in Florida in 1513 and his search for a fountain of youth, since Warm Mineral Springs is thought to have been that particular fountain. The Cyclorama was created as part of the 1959 commemorations for the 400th anniversary of Tristan de Luna's settlement of Pensacola, the first in \\"La Florida.\\" The large mural was painted by local Sarasota artist Don Putman and originally, was accompanied by a 22-minute narration by Lowell Thomas. The Cyclorama has been closed since the 1970s and its fate is unknown.

It is a good example of 13th-century Hoysala architecture. Located a short distance away in Nuggehalli, and built around the same time is the Sadashiva temple. The town was called Vijaya Somanathapura in ancient times and gained importance as an agrahara (place of learning) during the time of Bommanna Dandanayaka. Nuggehalli, (also spelled \\"Nuggihalli\\"), is a town in Hassan district of Karnataka, India. It is located on the Tiptur-Channarayapatna state highway and is about 50 km from Hassan city. It is well connected by road with Bangalore, the state capital.Foekema (1996), p. 83. Description Lakshmi Narasimha temple, built in the karnata dravida style in 1246 CE at Nuggehalli Lakshmi Narasimha temple, view from the southwestern corner Shrine outer wall with projecting minor shrine (aedicula) in Lakshmi Narasimha temple at Nuggehalli This is a good example of a richly decorated Hoysala temple built in the trikuta (three towers) vimana (shrine) style with fine sculptures adorning the walls.Quote:\\"Most Hoysala temples are either ekakuta (one tower), dvikuta (two towers) or trikuta, Foekema (1996), p. 25 The material used is Chloritic Schist, more commonly known as Soapstone)Quote:\\"The Western Chalukya carvings were done on green schist (Soapstone). This technique was adopted by the Hoysalas too, Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent, Takeo Kamiya and the temple is built on a jagati (platform) that closely follows the plan of the temple.Quote:\\"This is a Hoysala innovation, Quote:\\"The Jagati is in perfect unity with the rest of the temple\\", Foekema (1996), p. 25 The size of the original temple can be considered small, to which a larger open mantapa(hall) was later added. The three shrines are located around a central closed mantapa with 9 \\"bays\\" (compartment between four pillars).Quote:\\"A bay is a square or rectangular compartment in the hall\\", Foekema, p. 52, p. 93 The ceiling of the closed mantapa is supported by four lathe turned pillars which is deeply domed in the center.Quote:\\"This is a common feature of Western Chalukya-Hoysala temples\\", Kamath(2001), p. 117 The central shrine is the most prominent one and has a large tower. This shrine has a vestibule that connects the shrine to the mantapa (hall). Consequently, the vestibule also has a tower (or superstructure, shikhara) that looks like a shorter extension of the main tower. It is called the sukanasi. According to Foekema, it looks like the \\"nose\\" of the main tower.Quote:\\"It is on the sukanasi that the Hoysala crest is placed\\". The crest consists of a sculpture of \\"Sala\\" the mythical founder of the empire, fighting the lion. Foekema (1996), p. 22 The other two shrines have smaller towers and because they have no vestibule to connect them to the central mantapa, they have no sukanasi. From outside, the temple actually looks like a ekakuta (single tower and shrine) temple because the two lateral shrines are simple extensions of the wall of the mantapa. Their towers are a later addition. This is a classic example of a trikuta (three shrines and towers) that looks like a ekakuta.Fokema (1996), p. 84Quote:\\"Often in Hoysala temples, only the central of the three shrines has a tower. So the term trikuta may not literally by true\\", Foekema (1996), p. 24 A large open hall with tall pillars was added during later times making the original porch and closed mantapa look like the inner portion of the temple. The central shrine has five projections per side and the tower is complete though without the kalasha (decorative structure on top).Quote:\\"water pot like decorative stone structure on top of the tower. This is often lost over the centuries and normally seen replaced by a metallic pinnacle\\", Foekema (1996), p. 27 Since the shrine is square in plan, the topping roof (a helmet like sculptured stone) follows the same plan. There are three tiers of decorative smaller roofs bearing their own kalasa that form the body of the main tower. The superstructure on top of the vestibule (forming the nose) has only two tiers of decorative roofs. This is why the sukanasi looks like an extension of the main tower. The two lateral shrines also have five projections per side. The top of these shrines and the wall of the mantapa are crowned with a row of decorated roofs just like the main shrine. According to art critic Gerard Foekema, the temple is of a \\"newer\\" Hoysala style,Foekema (1996), p. 85 and below the superstructure of the vimana where the roof meets the outer walls of the temple, two eaves all round the temple.Quote:\\"An eaves is a projecting roof, overhanging the wall\\", Foekema (1996), p. 93 The upper eaves projects about half a meter from the wall. There is a second eaves running about a meter below the upper eaves with decorative miniature towers (aedicule) between them. The wall images of Hindu gods and goddesses and their attendants are below the lower eaves, and there are 120 such sculptured panels in all. Below these are six moldings of equal size with decorations in frieze. This according to historian Kamath is broadly called \\"horizontal treatment\\".Kamath (2001), p. 134 The six moldings at the base of the wall is divided into two sections. Starting from the base where the wall meets the jagati, the first horizontal lmolding contains procession of elephants, above which are a horsemen, and a band of foliage on the third. The second horizontal section starts with depictions from the Hindu epics and puranic scenes executed with detail. Above this are two friezes of yalis (or makara, an imaginary beast) and hamsas (swans). The vimana tower is divided into three horizontal sections and is even more ornate than the walls.Foekema (1996), p. 24Quote:\\"Art critic Percy Brown calls this one of the distinguishing features of Hoysala art\\", Kamath (2001), p. 134 The images in the panels are mostly Vaishnava in faith and they are attributed to two well known Hoysala sculptors, Baichoja and Mallitamma.Foekema (1996), p.85, There are a few images of the god Shiva in the form of Bhairava along with his consort Bhairavi. Baichoja's sculptures are on the south side of the temple and according to Foekema, have a certain peace and dignity about them. Mallitamma's sculptures are on the north side. According to him, while they are not as fine, they are lively and have greater variety.Foekema, (2001), p. 85 The three shrines contain the images of Venugopala, Keshava and Lakshminarasimha, all avatars of Vishnu.

Born in the New York City borough of the Bronx, he was educated at the University of Michigan, receiving a Ph.D. in Engineering Mechanics in 1955. After working for Bell Labs on the radio inertial guidance system of the Titan I intercontinental ballistic missile, he was hired by NASA in 1961. As Deputy Director of NASA's Office of Manned Space Flight, and later as head of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, Shea played a key role in shaping the course of the Apollo program, helping to lead NASA to the decision in favor of lunar orbit rendezvous and supporting \\"all up\\" testing of the Saturn V rocket. While sometimes causing controversy within the agency, Shea was remembered by his former colleague George Mueller as \\"one of the greatest systems engineers of our time\\".Mueller, \\"Joseph F. Shea,\\" in Memorial Tributes: National Academy of Engineering, Volume 10, p. 211. Deeply involved in the investigation of the 1967 Apollo 1 fire, Shea suffered from stress. He was moved to an alternative position in Washington and left NASA shortly afterwards. From 1968 until 1990 he worked as a senior manager at Raytheon in Lexington, Massachusetts, and thereafter became an adjunct professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT. While Shea served as a consultant for NASA on the redesign of the International Space Station in 1993, he was forced to resign from the position due to health issues. Early life and education Shea was born September 5, 1925, and grew up in the Bronx, the eldest son in a working-class Irish Catholic family. His father worked as a mechanic on the New York City Subway. As a child, Shea had no interest in engineering; he was a good runner and hoped to become a professional athlete. He attended a Catholic high school and graduated when he was only sixteen.Murray and Cox, Apollo, p. 121. On graduating in 1943, Shea enlisted in the U.S. Navy and enrolled in a program that would put him through college. He began his studies at Dartmouth College, later moving to MIT and finally to the University of Michigan, where he would remain until he earned his Doctorate in 1955. In 1946, he was commissioned as an Ensign in the Navy and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics. Shea went on to earn a MSc (1950) and a Ph.D. (1955) in Engineering Mechanics from the University of Michigan. While obtaining his doctorate, Shea found the time to teach at the university and to hold down a job at Bell Labs.Murray and Cox, Apollo, p. 121. Mueller, \\"Joseph F. Shea,\\" in Memorial Tributes: National Academy of Engineering, Volume 10, p. 211. Systems engineer After receiving his doctorate, Shea took a position at Bell Labs in Whippany, New Jersey. There he first worked as systems engineer on the radio guidance system of the Titan I intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and then as the development and program manager on the inertial guidance system of the Titan II ICBM.Mueller, \\"Joseph F. Shea,\\" in Memorial Tributes: National Academy of Engineering, Volume 10, p. 212. Shea's specialty was systems engineering, a new type of engineering developed in the 1950s that focused on the management and integration of large-scale projects, turning the work of engineers and contractors into one functioning whole. He played a significant role in the Titan I project; as George Mueller writes, \\"[H]e contributed a considerable amount of engineering innovation and project management skill and was directly responsible for the successful development of this pioneering guidance system.\\" In addition to Shea's technical abilities, it quickly became obvious that he was also an excellent manager of people. Known for his quick intellect, he also endeared himself to his subordinates through small eccentricities such as his fondness for bad puns and habit of wearing red socks to important meetings.Murray and Cox, Apollo, p. 122. During the critical days of the Titan project Shea moved into the plant, sleeping on a cot in his office so as to be available at all hours if he was needed.Murray and Cox, Apollo, p. 123. Having brought in the project on time and on budget, Shea established a reputation in the aerospace community. In 1961 he was offered and accepted a position with Space Technology Laboratories, a division of TRW Inc., where he continued to work on ballistic missile systems. NASA career In December 1961, NASA invited Shea to interview for the position of deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight (OMSF). D. Brainerd Holmes, Director of the OMSF, had been searching for a deputy who could offer expertise in systems engineering, someone with the technical abilities to supervise the Apollo program as a whole. Shea was recommended by one of Holmes' advisors, who had worked with him at Bell Labs.Murray and Cox, Apollo, pp. 120‚Äì1. Although Shea had worked at Space Technology Labs for less than a year, he was captivated by the challenge offered by the NASA position. \\"I could see they needed good people in the space program,\\" he later said, \\"and I was kind of cocky in those days.\\" =Lunar orbit rendezvous= When Shea was hired by NASA, President John F. Kennedy's commitment to landing men on the Moon was still only seven months old, and many of the major decisions that shaped the Apollo program were yet to be made. Foremost among these was the mode that NASA would use to land on the Moon. When Shea first began to consider the issue in 1962, most NASA engineers and managersincluding Wernher von Braun, the director of the Marshall Space Flight Centerfavored either an approach called direct ascent, where the Apollo spacecraft would land on the Moon and return to the Earth as one unit, or Earth orbit rendezvous, where the spacecraft would be assembled while still in orbit around the Earth. However, dissenters such as John Houbolt, a Langley engineer, favored an approach that was then considered to be more risky: lunar orbit rendezvous, in which two spacecraft would be used. A command/service module (CSM) would remain in orbit around the Moon, while a lunar module would land on the Moon and return to dock with the CSM in lunar orbit, then be discarded.Hansen, Enchanted Rendezvous, passim. The lunar orbit rendezvous decision is announced at a NASA press conference in July 1962. Joe Shea is at the far right. In November 1961, John Houbolt had sent a paper advocating lunar orbit rendezvous (LOR) to Robert Seamans, the deputy administrator of NASA. As Shea remembered, \\"Seamans gave a copy of Houbolt's letter to Brainerd Holmes [the director of OMSF]. Holmes put the letter on my desk and said: Figure it out.\\" Shea, Oral History (PDF), August 26, 1998, Johnson Space Center Oral History Project, p. 1. Shea became involved in the lunar orbit rendezvous decision as a result of this letter. While he began with a mild preference for earth orbit rendezvous, Shea \\"prided himself\\", according to space historians Murray and Cox, \\"on going wherever the data took him\\".Murray and Cox, Apollo, p. 124. In this case, the data took him to NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, where he met with John Houbolt and with the Space Task Group, and became convinced that LOR was an option worth considering.Hansen, Enchanted Rendezvous, p. 23. Shea's task now became to shepherd NASA to a firm decision on the issue. This task was complicated by the fact that he had to build consensus between NASA's different centersmost notably the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston headed by Robert Gilruth, and the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, headed by Wernher von Braun. Relations between the centers were not good, and it was a major milestone in the progress of the Apollo program when von Braun and his team finally came to accept the superiority of the LOR concept. NASA announced its decision at a press conference on July 11, 1962, only six months after Shea had joined NASA. Space historian James Hansen concludes that Shea \\"played a major role in supporting Houbolt's ideas and making the ... decision in favor of LOR\\", while his former colleague George Mueller writes that \\"it is a tribute to Joe's logic and leadership that he was able to build a consensus within the centers at a time when they were autonomous.\\"Mueller, quoted in Rosen, \\"Apollo 11 remembered,\\" Aerospace America, November 1994, p. B7. During his time at the OMSF, Shea helped to resolve many of the other inevitable engineering debates and conflicts that cropped up during the development of the Apollo spacecraft. In May 1963, he formed a Panel Review Board, bringing together representatives of the many committees that aimed to coordinate work between NASA centers. Under Shea's leadership, this coordination became far more efficient.Brooks, Grimwood and Swenson, Chariots for Apollo, pp. 122‚Äì3 =Program manager= In October 1963, Shea became the new manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office (ASPO) in Houston. Although technically a demotion, this new position gave Shea the responsibility for managing the design and construction of the Apollo command and lunar modules. Of particular concern to Shea was the performance of North American Aviation, the contractor responsible for the command module. As he later recounted: > I do not have a high opinion of North American and their motives in the > early days. Their first program manager was a first-class jerk. ... There > were spots of good guys, but it was just an ineffective organization. They > had no discipline, no concept of change control.Murray and Cox, Apollo, p. > 170. It was Shea's responsibility to bring that engineering discipline to North American and to NASA's management of its contractors. His systems management experience served him well in his new post. In the coming years, any change to the design of the Apollo spacecraft would have to receive its final approval from Shea himself.Murray and Cox, Apollo, p. 174. He kept control of the program using a management tool that he devised for himself‚Äîa looseleaf notebook, more than a hundred pages in length, that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of the important developments that had taken place and decisions that needed to be made. Presented with the notebook on Thursday evenings, Shea would study and annotate it over the weekend and return to work with new questions, instructions, and decisions. This idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever-expanding program.Murray and Cox, Apollo, pp. 172‚Äì3. Shea's relationship with the engineers at North American was a difficult one. While Shea blamed North American's management for the continuing difficulties in the development of the command module, project leader Harrison Storms felt that NASA itself was far from blameless. It had delayed in making key design decisions, and persisted in making significant changes to the design once construction had begun. While Shea did his part in attempting to control the change requests, Storms felt that Shea did not understand or sympathize with the inevitable problems involved in the day-to-day work of manufacturing.Gray, Angle of Attack, pp. 184, 188. Shea at an engineering meeting during the Apollo program Shea was a controversial figure even at the Manned Spacecraft Center. Not having been at Langley with the Space Task Group, he was considered an \\"outsider\\" by men such as flight director Chris Kraft, who recalled that \\"the animosity between my people and Shea's was intense\\".Kraft, Flight, p. 251. Relations between Shea and other NASA centers were even more uneasy. As the deputy director of OMSF, Shea had sought to extend the authority of NASA Headquarters over the fiercely independent NASA centers. This was particularly problematic when it came to the Marshall Space Flight Center, which had developed its own culture under Wernher von Braun. Von Braun's philosophy of engineering differed from Shea's, taking a consensual rather than top-down approach. As one historian recounts, von Braun felt that \\"Shea had 'bitten off' too much work and was going to 'wreck' the centers engineering capabilities.\\"Sato, \\"Local Engineering and Systems Engineering,\\" Technology and Culture, July 2005, p. 576. The friction between Shea and Marshall, which had begun when Shea was at OMSF, continued after he moved to his new position. He became deeply involved in supporting George Mueller's effort to impose the idea of \\"all up\\" testing of the Saturn V rocket on the unwilling engineers at Marshall. Von Braun's approach to engineering was a conservative one, emphasizing the incremental testing of components. But the tight schedule of the Apollo program did not allow for this slow and careful process. What Mueller and Shea proposed was to test the Saturn V as one unit on its very first flight, and Marshall only reluctantly came to accept this approach in late 1963.Murray and Cox, Apollo, pp. 158, 162. When later asked how he and Mueller had managed to sell the idea to von Braun, Shea responded that \\"we just told him that's the way it's going to be, finally.\\" Shea, Oral History (PDF), August 26, 1998, Johnson Space Center Oral History Project, p. 7. Shea's role in resolving differences within NASA, and between NASA and its contractors, placed him in a position where criticism was inevitable. However, even Shea's critics could not help but respect his engineering and management skills. Everyone who knew Shea considered him to be a brilliant engineer,Gray, Angle of Attack, p. 188. Murray and Cox, Apollo, p. 121. and his time as manager at ASPO only served to solidify a reputation that had been formed during his time on the Titan project. Of Shea's work in the mid-1960s, Murray and Cox write that \\"these were Joe Shea's glory days, and whatever the swirl of opinions about this gifted, enigmatic man, he was taking an effort that had been foundering and driving it forward.\\"Murray and Cox, Apollo, p. 178. Shea's work also won wider attention, bringing him public recognition that approached that accorded to Wernher von Braun or Chris Kraft. Kraft had appeared on the cover of Time in 1965; Time planned to offer Shea the same honor in February 1967, the month in which the first manned Apollo mission was scheduled to occur.Murray and Cox, Apollo, p. 186. =Apollo 1 fire= Background Problems with the Apollo command module continued through the testing phase. The review meeting for the first spacecraft intended for a manned mission took place on August 19, 1966. One issue of concern was the amount of Velcro in the cabin, a potential fire hazard in the pure-oxygen atmosphere of the spacecraft, if there were to be a spark. As Shea later recounted: > And so the issue was brought up at the acceptance of the spacecraft, a long > drawn-out discussion. I got a little annoyed, and I said, \\"Look, there's no > way there's going to be a fire in that spacecraft unless there's a spark or > the astronauts bring cigarettes aboard. We're not going to let them smoke.\\" > Well, I then issued orders at that meeting, \\"Go clean up the spacecraft. Be > sure that all the fire rules are obeyed.\\" Shea, Oral History (PDF), November > 23, 1998, Johnson Space Center Oral History Project, p. 16. Although the spacecraft passed its review, the crew finished the meeting by presenting Shea with a picture of the three of them seated around a model of the capsule, heads bowed in prayer. The inscription was simple: > It isn't that we don't trust you, Joe, but this time we've decided to go > over your head.Murray and Cox, Apollo, p. 184. The Apollo 1 astronauts presented this picture to Joe Shea as a joke before the fire. On January 25, 1967, the Apollo 1 crew began a series of countdown tests in the spacecraft on the pad at Cape Kennedy. Although Shea had ordered his staff to direct North American to take action on the issue of flammable materials in the cabin, he had not supervised the issue directly, and little if any action had been taken.Murray and Cox, Apollo, p. 185. During pad testing, the spacecraft suffered a number of technical problems, including broken and static-filled communications. Wally Schirra, the backup commander for the mission, suggested to Shea that Shea should go through the countdown test in the spacecraft with the crew in order to experience first-hand the issues that they were facing. Although he seriously considered the idea, it proved to be unworkable because of the difficulties of hooking up a fourth communications loop for Shea. The hatch would have to be left open in order to run the extra wires out, and leaving the hatch open would make it impossible to run the emergency egress test that had been scheduled for the end of the day on the 27th.Gray, Angle of Attack, pp. 226‚Äì7. As Shea later told the press, joining the crew for the test would have been \\"highly irregular\\".\\"2 Space Aides Decided Not to Join Apollo Test,\\" The New York Times, February 12, 1967, p. 32. A \\"plugs-out\\" spacecraft test, simulating the launch countdown, took place on January 27. While Shea was in Florida for the beginning of the test, he decided to leave before it concluded. He arrived back at his office in Houston at about 5:30 p.m. CST.Murray and Cox, Apollo, p. 188. At 5:31 p.m. CST (6:31 p.m. EST) a massive fire broke out in the Apollo command module. Unable to escape, the three astronauts inside the spacecraft, Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee, were killed. Investigation The interior of the Apollo 1 capsule after the fire Immediately after the fire, Shea and his ASPO colleagues at Houston boarded a NASA plane to the Kennedy Space Center. They landed at about 1:00 a.m., only five hours after the fire had broken out. At a meeting that morning with Robert Gilruth, George Mueller and George Low, Shea helped to determine the individuals who would be on the NASA review board looking into the causes of the fire. Additionally, he persuaded George Mueller, head of NASA's Office of Manned Space Flight, to allow him to act as Mueller's deputy in Florida, supervising the progress of the investigation.Murray and Cox, Apollo, pp. 206‚Äì11. Named to the advisory group chosen to support the review board,Ertel and Newkirk, Apollo Spacecraft, Vol IV, p. 70. Shea threw himself into the investigation, working eighty-hour weeks.Gray, Angle of Attack, p. 238. Although the precise source of ignition was never found, it soon became clear that an electrical short somewhere in the command module had started the fire, probably sparked by a chafed wire. What was less clear was where to apportion responsibility. NASA engineers tended to point to what they saw as shoddy workmanship by North American Aviation.Murray and Cox, Apollo, pp. 214‚Äì15. By contrast, North American executives blamed NASA management for its decision over their objections to pressurize the command module with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in space, in which almost any materialincluding Velcro, with which the cabin was filledwould instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark.Gray, Angle of Attack, p. 245. Whatever the precise distribution of responsibility, Shea remained haunted by the feeling that he, personally, was responsible for the deaths of three astronauts. For years after the fire, he displayed the portrait given to him by the Apollo 1 crew in the front hallway of his own home.Murray and Cox, Apollo, p. 225. Breakdown The pressure of the investigation took a psychological toll on Shea. He had trouble sleeping and began to resort to barbiturates and alcohol in order to help him cope.Murray and Cox, Apollo, pp. 213‚Äì14. Shea was not the only NASA employee who found the aftermath of the fire difficult to handle: Robert Seamans wrote that \\"key people from Houston would fly up to Washington to testify and literally sob all the way on the plane\\",Seamans, Aiming at Targets, p. 139. and a man who worked under Shea suffered a nervous breakdown and was reportedly taken to a mental hospital in a straitjacket.O'Toole, Thomas; Schefter, Jim. \\"The Bumpy Road that Led Man to the Moon\\", The Washington Post, July 15, 1979, p. E1. A few weeks after the fire, Shea's colleagues began to notice that he too was behaving erratically. Chris Kraft, whose father had suffered from schizophrenia, later related Shea's behavior in one meeting: > Joe Shea got up and started calmly with a report on the state of the > investigation. But within a minute, he was rambling, and in another thirty > seconds, he was incoherent. I looked at him and saw my father, in the grip > of dementia praecox. It was horrifying and fascinating at the same > time.Kraft, Flight, p. 275. NASA administrator James Webb became increasingly worried about Shea's mental state. Specifically, he was concerned that Shea might not be able to deal with the hostile questioning that he would receive from the congressional inquiry into the Apollo 1 fire. Senator Walter Mondale had accused NASA engineers of \\"criminal negligence\\" with regard to the design and construction of the Apollo command module, and it was expected that Shea would be in the firing line. In March, Webb sent Robert Seamans and Charles Berry, NASA's head physician, to speak with Shea and ask him to take an extended voluntary leave of absence. This would, they hoped, protect him from being called to testify. A press release had already been prepared, but Shea refused, threatening to resign rather than take leave. As a compromise, he agreed to meet with a psychiatrist and to abide by an independent assessment of his psychological fitness. Yet this approach to removing Shea from his position was also unsuccessful.Murray and Cox, Apollo, pp. 217‚Äì19. As one of his friends later recounted: > The psychiatrists came back saying, 'He's so smart, he's so intelligent!' > Here Joe was, ready to kill himself, but he could still outsmart the > psychiatrists.Murray and Cox, Apollo, p. 219. Reassignment Shea's superiors were finally forced to take a more direct approach. On April 7 it was announced that Shea would be moving to NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., where he would serve as George Mueller's deputy at the Office of Manned Space Flight. He was replaced as chief of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office by George Low.Ertel and Newkirk, Apollo Spacecraft, Vol IV, p. 119. While Shea had already acted as Mueller's de facto deputy in Florida during the investigation, the reality of this permanent posting was very different. When Shea's reassignment was announced, one of his friends gave an anonymous interview to Time magazine in which he said that \\"if Joe stays in Washington, it'll be a promotion. If he leaves in three or four months, you'll know this move amounted to being fired.\\"\\"How Soon the Moon?\\", Time, April 14, 1967. Shea accepted the reassignment reluctantly, feeling that \\"it was as if NASA was trying to hide me from the Congress for what I might have said\\". Shea, Oral History (PDF), November 23, 1998, Johnson Space Center Oral History Project, p. 18. Once in the job, he grew increasingly dissatisfied with a posting that he considered to be a \\"non-job\\", later commenting that \\"I don't understand why, after everything I had done for the program ... I was only one that was removed. That's the end of the program for me.\\" Shea, Oral History (PDF), November 23, 1998, Johnson Space Center Oral History Project, p. 17. Only six months after the fire, and some two months after taking his new position, Shea left NASA in order to become a Vice President at the Polaroid Corporation in Waltham, Massachusetts. He was never called to testify before the congressional inquiry into the fire. Post-NASA career In 1968, Shea took a position at Raytheon in Lexington, Massachusetts. He would remain with the company until his retirement in 1990, serving as Senior Vice President for Engineering from 1981 through 1990. After leaving Raytheon, Shea became an adjunct professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT. In February 1993, NASA administrator Daniel Goldin appointed Shea to the chairmanship of a technical review board convened to oversee the redesign of the troubled International Space Station project.Sawyer, \\"NASA Picks Manager to Cut Expenditures on Space Station,\\" The Washington Post, February 27, 1993, p. A2. However, Shea was hospitalized shortly after his appointment. By April he was well enough to attend a meeting where the design team formally presented the preliminary results of its studies, but his behavior at the meeting again called his capacities into question. As The Washington Post reported: > Shea made a rambling, sometimes barely audible two-hour presentation that > left many of those present speculating about his ability to do the job. A > longtime friend said, \\"That's not the real Joe Shea. He is normally incisive > and well-organized.\\" On the day following the meeting, Shea offered his resignation, becoming instead a special advisor to Daniel Goldin. NASA reported that he had resigned due to health reasons. However, The Scientist offered a different interpretation, quoting sources who speculated that the bluntness of his speech, including criticisms of Goldin, may have been controversial in NASA circles.Veggeberg, \\"President to Space Station,\\" vol 7, issue 10, p. 3. Shea died on February 14, 1999, at his home in Weston, Massachusetts. He was survived by his wife Carol, six daughters, and one son.Mueller, \\"Joseph F. Shea,\\" in Memorial Tributes: National Academy of Engineering, Volume 10, pp. 211, 214.

It was designed to serve as a handheld computer device that translates English into one of 40 different languages. The device The Phraselator is a small speech translation PDA-sized device designed to aid in interpretation. The device does not produce synthesized speech like that utilized by Stephen Hawking; instead, it plays pre-recorded foreign language MP3 files. Users can select the phrase they wish to convey from an English list on the screen or speak into the device. It then uses speech recognition technology called DynaSpeak, developed by SRI International, to play the proper sound file. The accuracy of the speech recognition software is over 70 percent according to software developer Jack Buchanan. The device can also record replies for translation later. Pre-recorded phrases are stored on Secure Digital flash memory cards. A 128 MB card can hold up to 12,000 phrases in 4 or 5 languages. Users can download phrase modules from the official website, which contained over 300,000 phrases as of March 2005. Users can also construct their own custom phrase modules. Earlier devices were known to have run on an SA-1110 Strong Arm 206 MHz CPU with 32MB SDRAM and 32MB onboard Flash RAM. A newer model, the P2, was released in 2004 and developed according to feedback from U.S. soldiers. It translates one way from English to approximately 60 other languages. It has a directional microphone, a larger library of phrases and a longer battery life. The 2004 release was created by and utilizes a computer board manufactured by InHand Electronics, Inc. In the future, the device will be able to display pictures so users can ask questions such as \\"Have you seen this person?\\" Developer Ace Sarich notes that the device is inferior to human interpreter. Conclusions derived from a Nepal field test conducted by U.S. and Nepal based NGO Himalayan Aid in 2004 seemed to confirm Sarich's comparisons: > The very concept of using a machine as a communication point between > individuals seemed to actually encourage a more limited form of interaction > between tester and respondent. Usually, when limited language skills are > present between parties, the genuine struggle and desire to communicate acts > as a display of good will ‚Äì we openly display our weakness in this regard ‚Äì > and the result is a more relaxed and human encounter. This was not > necessarily present with the Phraselator as all parties abandoned learning > about each other and instead focused on learning how to work with the > device.

Large humanitarian or natural disasters in > remote areas of third-world countries might be an effective example. Origin The original idea for the device came from Lee Morin, a Navy doctor in Operation Desert Storm. To communicate with patients, he played Arabic audio files from his laptop. He informed Ace Sarich, the vice president of VoxTec, about the idea. VoxTec won a DARPA Small Business Innovation Research grant in early 2001 to develop a military-grade handheld phrase translator. During its development, the Phraselator was tested and evaluated by scientists from the Army Research Laboratory. The device was first field tested in Afghanistan in 2001. By 2002, about 500 Phraselators were built for soldiers around the world with another 250 ordered by the U.S. Special Forces. The device cost $2000 to develop and could convert spoken English into one of 200,000 recorded commands and questions in 30 languages. However, the device could only translate one-way. At the time, the only existing two-way voice translator that could convert speech back and forth between languages was the Audio Voice Translation Guide System, or TONGUES, which was developed by Carnegie Mellon University for Lockheed Martin. As part of a DARPA program known as the Spoken Language Communication and Translation System for Tactical Use, SRI International has further developed two-way translation software for use in Iraq called IraqComm in 2006 which contains a vocabulary of 40,000 English words and 50,000 words in Iraqi Arabic. Notable users The handheld translator was recently used by U.S. troops while providing relief to tsunami victims in early 2005. About 500 prototypes of the device were provided to U.S. military forces in Operation Enduring Freedom. Units loaded with Haitian dialects have been provided to U.S. troops in Haiti. Army military police have used it in Kandahar to communicate with POWs. In late 2004, the U.S. Navy began to augment some ships with a version of the device attached to large speakers in order to broadcast clear voice instructions up to away. Corrections officers and law enforcement in Oneida County, New York have tested the device. Hospital emergency rooms and health departments have also evaluated it. Several Native American tribes such as the Choctaw Nation, the Ponca, and the Comanche Nation have also used the device to preserve their dying languages. Various law enforcement agencies, such as the Los Angeles Police Department, also use the phraselator in their patrol cars. Awards In March 2004, DARPA director Dr. Tony Tether presented the Small Business Innovative Research Award to the VoxTec division of Marine Acoustics at DARPATech 2004 in Anaheim, CA. The device was recently listed as one of \\"Ten Emerging Technologies That Will Change Your World\\" in MIT's Technology Review. Pop culture Software developer Jack Buchanan believes that building a device similar to the fictional universal translator seen in Star Trek would be harder than building the Enterprise. The device was mentioned in a list of \\"Top 10 Star Trek Tech\\" on Space.com.

The station is owned & operated by the Maritime Broadcasting System. History The station was first launched by radio pioneer Keith Rogers on August 15, 1924 as 10AS on 250 meters. In 1925, the station was granted a full license as CFCY, broadcasting at 960 AM. It is considered one of the oldest radio stations in the Atlantic provinces. In 1931, it moved to 580 AM, and then to its final AM position at 630 in 1933. Originally known as \\"The Friendly Voice of the Maritimes\\", the location in the centre of the Gulf of St. Lawrence allowed CFCY's 5,000-watt daytime signal to reach portions of Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec and New England as well as most of the Maritime provinces. The station has roots in traditional country music, bringing \\"Don Messer\\" to national recognition throughout the 1940s and 1950s.\\"Don Messer\\". Encyclopedia of Music in Canada, author Richard Green] National broadcasts over the CBC network from CFCY led to the Messer group gaining stature as the \\"most popular group in Canada during the mid-20th century\\", eventually helping the group make their successful jump from radio to television. Rogers wanted to expand into television, but died in 1954. His company, Island Broadcasting, passed on to his family including his widow Flora, and daughter Betty Rogers Large as well as son-in-law Bob Large. They brought television to the Island when CFCY-TV launched on July 1, 1956.\\"Television Comes to P.E.I. CFCY-TV\\", The Guardian, Charlottetown, PEI, August 14, 1956 The CFCY stations were both CBC affiliates. However, in 1969, CFCY-TV was sold directly to the CBC as CBCT-TV. After celebrating 50 years of broadcasting in 1974, The radio station stopped being a CBC affiliate in 1977, when the company opened CBCT-FM in Charlottetown; at that time, Island Broadcasting was renamed Eastern Broadcasting. The station was then sold to Maritime Broadcasting in 1986. As a change from the varied mix of music, a weekly community feature, \\"Farm Radio Forum\\", was produced by the Prince Edward Island Federation of Agriculture. The staff would also interview tourist as they waited for the ferry after visiting the Island. The station's format saw very little competition until the arrival of FM radio which led to rebranding in a country music format in 1996. On March 24, 2006, approval from the CRTC was given for CFCY to switch over to the FM band.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2006-89 In September 2006, CFCY made its switch to FM with permission to simulcast the new station on the old 630 AM signal for 90 days and to cease operations on the AM signal afterwards. In December 2006, the audio feed for CFCY-AM at 630 has ceased operations. However, an open carrier remained on the air at 630 AM which had some wondering if it was CFCY-AM or a pirate taking over the FM frequency. No link was established between this open carrier at 630 AM and the mysterious toned-down stations being widely recognizable throughout North America in late November. In January 2007 it was finally realized that the CFCY AM transmitter simply had not been turned off.  People  On-air personalities are Chris Pride (Pride in the mornings), Russel MacKenzie (Afternoons), Darren MacPherson (Saturday Night Hoedown) and Dave Sigsworth (Swing announcer). Announcers from the recent past include Chris MacDonald, Alex Firth, Stephanie Davey, Paul Allan, Rebecca Black, Adam Ramsay and Nick Young. Loman McAulay was one of many people who had lengthy careers with the station, from the 1940s until his death in 1987. Betty Rogers Large spent over 60 years at the station in various capacities‚Äîone of the longest careers in Canadian broadcasting history. She first appeared on-air in 1925 at age 12.

Since its creation, it has produced many environmental media campaigns, most notably a 2003 campaign and public service announcement, titled \\"The Ocean Symphony PSA\\", which starred such Hollywood actors/celebrities as Jack Black, Henry Winkler, Tom Arnold, and Madeleine Stowe, among many others. Their slogan, \\"Create... Innovate... Communicate\\", has taken on a more direct meaning since the August 2006 launch of the Shifting Baselines Flix Contest, a 1-minute short film contest aimed at channeling the youthful, creative energy of such \\"viral video\\" internet sites as YouTube and Ifilm. The contest featured Celebrity Judges, and cash prizes, and succeeded in bringing out an explosion of innovative new ways to communicate the environmental and social messaging associated with ocean awareness and the idea of shifting baselines/lowered standards. Partners The Shifting Baselines Ocean Media Project has 26 partner groups, more than almost any other environmental campaign in the world. Its success and popularity with other environmental organizations is mainly due to its versatile and broad approach that can stretch across the many boundaries of communication that many other media projects cannot. The Flix contest is an ongoing project. Amateur film-makers, and cinema students the world over have joined in to compete for the editing software and cash prizes offered by the contest. Your films need not be about the ocean, necessarily. You can also make a film about the broader idea of shifting baselines, which refers to the lowered standards created when we can no longer tell what is natural for our world any more. For instance, how do we know how clean our water originally was? Today all of our water has small, but ever-increasing levels of mercury, lead, and other even more poisonous compounds. Certainly a certain amount of that has always been in the water, but how much is normal? How much is natural? And how do we know what \\"Pristine\\" is any more? When talking about what is natural we really have no clue what the world was like before human impact, and therefore cannot know what struggles we have to put forward in order to clean up the world and make it liveable and drinkable again. Alternative Meanings This meaning of \\"shifting baselines\\" is a fairly heavy depressing one. However, many people have taken a much more light- hearted approach to the term, using it to refer to the lowered standards of dating, the lowered standards of politicians, traffic, television, etc. The broadness of the term allows many hilarious variations on the subject. For further reference see the Shifting Baselines Comedy Contest of 2003, in which comedians from all over the U.S., submitted their videos and stand-up routines on the subject of shifting baselines/lowered standards. That shifting baselines contest was judged by such Hollywood celebrities and industry innovators and Norman Lear, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Bill Maher.

The screenplay by Leonard Spigelgass is based on the book of the 1959 stage musical Gypsy: A Musical Fable by Arthur Laurents, which was adapted from the 1957 autobiography Gypsy: A Memoir by Gypsy Rose Lee. Stephen Sondheim wrote the lyrics for songs composed by Jule Styne. The film was remade for television in 1993. Plot Determined to make her young, blonde, and beautiful daughter June a vaudeville headliner, willful, resourceful, domineering stage mother Rose Hovick will stop at nothing to achieve her goal. She drags the girl and her shy, awkward, and decidedly less-talented older sister Louise around the country in an effort to get them noticed, and with the assistance of agent Herbie Sommers, she manages to secure them bookings on the prestigious Orpheum Circuit. Years pass, and the girls no longer are young enough to pull off the childlike personae their mother insists they continue to project. June rebels, and elopes with Jerry, one of the dancers who backs the act. Devastated by what she considers an act of betrayal, Rose pours all her energies into making a success of Louise, despite the young woman's obvious lack of singing and dancing skills. Not helping matters is the increasing popularity of sound films, which leads to a decline in the demand for stage entertainment. With bookings scarce, mother and daughter find themselves in Wichita, Kansas, where the owner of a third-rate burlesque house books the act in hopes of keeping the vice squad at bay. When one of the strippers is arrested for shoplifting, Rose immediately volunteers Louise for the spot as her replacement. Louise reluctantly agrees to go through with it, though it's clear she's only doing it to please her mother. This becomes the final straw for Herbie, as he's disgusted by the lengths to which Rose will go and realizes that Rose will never marry him. He leaves, though he gives her a moment to give him a reason to stay. She fails at giving him one. At first, Louise's voice is shaky and her moves tentative, at best, but as audiences respond to her she begins to gain confidence in herself. She blossoms as an entertainer billed as Gypsy Rose Lee, and eventually reaches a point where she tires of her mother's constant interference in both her life and wildly successful career. Louise confronts Rose and demands she leave her alone. Finally, aware that she has spent her life enslaved by a desperate need to be noticed, an angry, bitter, and bewildered Rose stumbles onto the empty stage of the deserted theatre and experiences a moment of truth that leads to an emotional breakdown followed by a reconciliation with Louise.

Coincidentally, Russell had just starred in the film version of the Leonard Spigelgass play A Majority of One at Warner Bros., which Brisson had produced, and all parties came together to make Gypsy, with Russell starring, LeRoy directing, and Spigelgass writing the highly faithful adaptation of the Arthur Laurents stage book. Although Russell had starred and sung in the 1953 stage musical Wonderful Town and the 1955 film The Girl Rush, the Gypsy score was beyond her. Her own gravelly singing voice was artfully blended with that of contralto Lisa Kirk. Kirk's ability to mimic Russell's voice is showcased in the final number \\"Rose's Turn\\", which is a clever blend of both of their voices. Kirk's full vocal version was released on the original soundtrack, although it is not the version used in the finished film. In later years, Russell's original tryout vocals were rediscovered on scratchy acetate discs and included as bonus tracks on the CD reissue of the film's soundtrack.Gypsy at CDUniverse.com Marni Nixon had dubbed Natalie Wood's singing voice in West Side Story the previous year, but Wood did her own singing in Gypsy. While Wood recorded a separate version of \\"Little Lamb\\" for the soundtrack album, in the film she sang the song \\"live\\" on the set. Other songs performed live were \\"Mr. Goldstone, I Love You\\" and the reprise of \\"Small World\\", both sung by Russell (not Kirk). Reaction =Critical reception= Film historian Douglas McVay observed in his book The Musical Film, \\"Fine as West Side Story is, though, it is equaled and, arguably, surpassed - in a rather different idiom - by another filmed Broadway hit: Mervyn LeRoy‚Äôs Gypsy. Arthur Laurents' book (for) West Side Story (adapted for the screen by Ernest Lehman), though largely craftsmanlike, falls short of his libretto for Gypsy (scripted on celluloid by Leonard Spigelgass), based on the memoirs of the transatlantic stripper Gypsy Rose Lee. The dialogue and situations in Gypsy have more wit, bite and emotional range, and the characterizations are more complex. Variety noted, \\"There is a wonderfully funny sequence involving three nails-hard strippers which comes when Gypsy has been unreeling about an hour. The sequence is thoroughly welcome and almost desperately needed to counteract a certain Jane One-Note implicit in the tale of a stage mother whose egotisms become something of a bore despite the canny skills of director-producer Mervyn LeRoy to contrive it otherwise. Rosalind Russell's performance as the smalltime brood-hen deserves commendation ... It is interesting to watch [Natalie Wood] ... go through the motions in a burlesque world that is prettied up in soft-focus and a kind of phony innocence. Any resemblance of the art of strip, and its setting, to reality is, in this film, purely fleeting.\\"Variety review =Box office performance= Gypsy was a financial success. Produced on a budget of $4 million, the film grossed $11,076,923 at the box office, earning $6 million in US theatrical rentals.\\"All-Time Top Grossers\\", Variety, 8 January 1964 pg 69.

From December 9, 1528 until January 9, 1531, he was a member of the First Audiencia of Mexico City, which was the governing body of New Spain during that period. The Audiencia of Santo Domingo The first Real Audiencia dates from 1371 in Valladolid, Castile. It served as a court of appeals. In the 1490s several other audiencias were set up in metropolitan Spain. The first such court in the Spanish Empire outside of Spain was established October 15, 1511 in Santo Domingo, in what is now the Dominican Republic. The first oidores (judges) of the Audiencia of Santo Domingo were Marcelo de Villalobos, Ortiz de Matienzo and Lucas V√°zquez de Ayll√≥n. Ortiz was related to two other high-ranking officials in Santo Domingo. His uncle Sancho de Matienzo was treasurer of the Casa de Contrataci√≥n, and his cousin Domingo de Ochandiano was in charge of the accounting office and served as temporary treasurer. The Audiencia's initial, geographically restricted jurisdiction was extended in 1528 to other Spanish possessions in the New World, including New Spain. The Audiencia of Santo Domingo was very corrupt. Ayll√≥n, Villalobos and Ortiz were apparently the objects of a juicio de residencia (grievance) proceeding in 1516, which exposed extraordinary corruption within the oligarchy that ruled the island. The first Audiencia of Mexico City After the conquest of New Spain by Hern√°n Cort√©s, the colony had been governed by a military government, often violent, arbitrary and exploitative of the Indigenous. Hoping to establish a more orderly and just government (and perhaps also to reduce the authority of Cort√©s), on December 13, 1527 the metropolitan government of Charles V in Burgos named a Real Audiencia to take over the government of New Spain. This consisted of a president and four oidores (judges). The president was Nu√±o Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n and the oidores were Ortiz de Matienzo, Diego Delgadillo, Diego Maldonado and Alonso de Parada. At the time Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n was already in New Spain, at P√°nuco, so Charles ordered the judges to assemble in Veracruz and from there make a joint entrance into the capital. However, Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n was delayed. The oidores from Spain did not wait for his arrival, but proceeded directly to the capital. They arrived there on December 8, 1528, taking over the government on the following day. They were given a splendid reception by the city government. Beltr√°n arrived a little after the others. Two of them, Maldonado and Parada, were sick on their arrival and soon died. They did not take part in the government. The Audiencia had instructions to improve the treatment of the Indigenous and to conclude the impeachment investigations of Cort√©s and his associates Pedro de Alvarado, Alonso de Estrada, Rodrigo de Albornoz, Gonzalo de Salazar and Pedro Alm√≠ndez Chirino within 90 days. Most of these associates had participated in the government in the proceeding few years while Cort√©s was in Honduras or Spain, with a lot of in-fighting among themselves and injustices to the population, both Indigenous and Spanish. Cort√©s himself was still in Spain, where he was defending his conduct and appealing to Charles concerning his loss of authority. Cort√©s had some success with his appeal, being named Marqu√©s del Valle de Oaxaca and receiving some other honors. Government of the first Audiencia This Audiencia was very corrupt, and Ortiz de Matienzo participated in the corruption. Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n, president of the Audiencia, left the capital on an expedition to conquer western Mexico on December 21, 1529, leaving Ortiz in charge. The Audiencia banned direct communication with the Court in Spain. This was so effective that Bishop Juan de Zum√°rraga, who also held the royal office of Protector of the Indians, felt the necessity of hiding a letter sealed in wax in a cask, to be smuggled to the Spanish authorities by a confederate sailor. The maladministration of the first Audiencia continued until the return of Cort√©s in July 1530. The members of the Audiencia intended to depose Cort√©s, but were prevented by the actions of Bishop Zum√°rraga. Shortly thereafter, the members of the second Audiencia arrived, taking power in January 1531. The second Audiencia was much different from the first, honest, capable and dedicated to good government and fair treatment of the Indigenous. Consequences The members of the first Audiencia were called to answer before other courts. Once again Ortiz was subject to a residencia suit. In all, one hundred twenty-five lawsuits were begun against the oidores. In one of the suits, Cort√©s accused Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n, Ortiz and Delgadillo of attempting to usurp his property and powers in New Spain during his absence in Spain in 1528. They were sentenced to lose all their repartimientos and to pay large fines.

The arrangements vary significantly case by case. Some of the main types of FEC are: * A certificate for purchasing foreign currency at a specified rate, often for a specified purpose, such as financing imports. This type of certificates were required in many European countries after World War II. * A certificate denominated in local currency, which foreign citizens are required to use for some or all of their purchases. The exchange rate may be more favourable for the visitor than the official commercial rate. The purpose is to channel the foreign exchange to the state coffers instead of the black market. This type of FEC's were in use in China in 1980‚Äì1994. * A certificate denominated in foreign currency, to which local citizens are required to exchange any foreign currency they manage to get possession of.

History Vine in downtown Cincinnati, seen here in the 1940s, was a local landmark. Originally from Albersweiler in Germany's Rhenish Palatinate, 45-year-old Elias Kahn immigrated to Cincinnati, Ohio, United States, in 1882 with his wife and nine children. Cincinnati had previously peaked as a leader in pork-packing. Once a dominant industry from the pre-Civil War era, the half-million hogs that were corralled through the city's streets had faded by the mid-19th century. Nevertheless, pork was still a big industry in Cincinnati when the E. Kahn's Sons Company was started in 1883. The original location for the meat market was on the city's Central Avenue. When Elias Kahn died in 1895, his four sons (Albert, Eugene, Louis, Nathan) and daughter (Matilda) took over the family business where it continued to expand. Kahn's quality and mildly seasoned meats resulted in regional demand, as the business continued to thrive for over 80 years. When the last of the Kahn brothers died in 1948, Matilda's son, Milton Schloss, became the company's president. In 1966, the company was sold to Consolidated Foods Corporation. 10 years later, the Sara Lee division of Consolidated Foods expanded after purchasing Hillshire Farm and Rudy's Farm. Sponsorships Kahn's franks were the official hot dogs of New York Mets during the 1980s and into the 2000s, being served at Shea Stadium. It is now the official hot dog of the Cincinnati Reds.

He is primarily a Superboy and Superman villain. Publication history Dabney Donovan first appeared in Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #142 and was created by Jack Kirby. Fictional character biography Dabney Donovan was the eccentric scientist and former head and co-founder of the Cadmus Project. Believing that there should be no limits in experimenting with the human gene, Donovan has given birth to countless genetic experiments. Donovan's first experiments, the Hairies, were a group of mentally enhanced hippies who developed a unique habitat that blended super-science with lush greenery. Among Donovan's most notable creations is the DNAliens, which are genetically-altered beings that look alien in appearance and have extreme paranormal abilities, like Dubbilex. Another of Donovan's experiments was the creation of the miniature planet Transilvane which he filled with microscopic creatures duplicating classic monsters based on Donovan's favorite horror films. The inhabitants of Transilvane were led by Count Dragorin. Around this time, he creates the two monstrosities, Simyan and Mokkari. These entities, scientific geniuses in their own right, would go on to cause separate troublesome incidents. One of Donovan's gifts was in cloning. Donovan used his cloning expertise in aiding Intergang, creating young bodies for the 1940s gangsters who founded the organisation. He once helped the ailing Lex Luthor clone himself a new body, in the guise of Lex Luthor II, when he was dying of a kryptonite-induced cancer. Lex Luthor tried to kill Donovan to protect his secret, but Donovan, of course, used his talents to create multiple clones of himself. However, Donovan would later get his revenge by helping Luthor's ex-wife Contessa Del Portenza and sending a Bizarro after Luthor. Donovan caused trouble with a clone plague that would cause clones to deteriorate and die. Luthor, still within his cloned body, sent his forces to battle Cadmus for the cure. Donovan eventually had to kill Cadmus's director Paul Westfield in order to keep his agenda hidden.\\"Superman\\" Vol 2 #90 (June, 1994) However, the cure was eventually found through the DNA of Guardian and given to those who needed it, beginning with Superboy. Around this time, Donovan led another attack on Cadmus, putting multiple high-level employees through gladiatorial style games.\\"Guardians Of Metropolis\\" #1-4 (1994) When the original directors left the Project, and Mickey Cannon was put in charge, Donovan was reinstated as an imprisoned \\"advisor\\". Despite the security safeguards in place he did succeed in causing trouble, including briefly taking control of the place during the 'Evil Factory' storyline.\\"Superboy\\" #70-75 (Jan.‚ÄìMay 2000) Donovan's current status is unknown as he has continued to defy death with his clones. Donovan Prime always finds a way to escape death, but his genetic monsters continue to plague Metropolis and Cadmus, who has made it their mission to protect people against these monsters. Other versions =Amalgam Comics= Another alternate Donovan appears in the Amalgam Comics one-shot Spider-Boy. Unlike most characters in the Amalgam books, he was not merged with a similar character from Marvel Comics. He is a staffer at the Project, a version of Cadmus located inside Fantastic Mountain (which merges Challenger Mountain from Challengers of the Unknown with the various headquarters used by the Fantastic Four). Donovan at the time had been feeding Project head Reed Richards a form of \\"evil DNA\\" in an attempt to take what he felt was his rightful place. The plot was discovered and Richards was cured \\"Spider-Boy\\" One-shot (1996) before the second round of Amalgam Comics were released, allowing him to lead the Challengers of the Fantastic against Galactiac. =Elseworlds= An alternate Donovan appears in the Elseworlds story The Superman Monster, a Frankenstein pastiche.

It was written by Brian Helgeland. The film tells the story of Charlie Sykes (Lowe) and his girlfriend Rachel Clark (Swanson), who is kidnapped by a demon and taken to Hell to become one of Satan's brides, while Charlie must travel to the other dimension to rescue her. The film features cameo appearances by Lita Ford, Gilbert Gottfried, actor Ben Stiller, his sister Amy Stiller and their parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara.  Synopsis  Charlie Sykes and Rachel Clark are a young all-American couple that decide to run away and elope in Las Vegas. On the road to Vegas, they ignore the warning of a local gas station attendant named Sam. They take an abandoned backroad where Rachel is kidnapped by a zombie Hell Cop who takes her to hell. Charlie goes back to Sam, and Sam explains what the Hellcop is and how to save her. Sam then gives Charlie a shotgun with special ammo and a car that holds a special attribute. After a few attempts, Charlie passes through the portal to hell, an expansive desert with buildings scattered about. On the highway, Charlie meets other dead people that live in Hell and even a motorcycle gang led by a rebel named Royce. He manages to catch up to Hell Cop, but his car gets shot up during the chase and becomes disabled. His car is then taken by a repair man named Beezle, who is able to fix the car and continue his pursuit. Charlie eventually finds out that Beezle's kid assistant Adam had sneaked into the car wanting to help him find Rachel and keep his dog Ben company. Adam tells him that Hell Cop killed his family and took him to hell and gave him to Beezle. Charlie promises to bring him back with him. Charlie eventually tracks down Hell Cop and Rachel at a nightclub/casino. He tries to free Rachel, but Hell Cop would grab Charlie's shotgun and fatally shoot Charlie before they both leave. Fortunately Beezle came, and after securing a promise from Adam to come back with him, he uses his repair powers and saves Charlie so he can continue his pursuit. Charlie decides to try a short cut, but before he goes in, Clara, Royce's girlfriend (and Sam's former girlfriend before she was taken) warns him about short cuts, and that a decision she made forced her to spend eternity in hell. He goes on where Charlie defeats \\"Hell Cop\\" and saves Rachel, who's sexually aggressive towards him. He finds out from her reflection that Rachel is a demon in disguise and this was a trap. After defeating the demon, he heads back on the highway and makes it to the outskirts of Hell City. With Sam distracting Cerberus, Charlie convinces Charon to give him a ride over the River Styx to the city. He's able to sneak his way around and make it to Rachel. Satan then appears, wanting Rachel as a bride. Since Charlie went through all the trouble, Satan decides to let them go. But when Charlie looks back, a large group of minions appear. They manage to break into Hell Cop's car, and using its power, is able to break through the wall and jump over the river to their car. When he goes back to Beezle's place to get Adam, his repair shop had become a mansion. Beezle comes out, revealing that he's Satan, and won't allow him to take Adam. Charlie proposes a deal: A race against Hell Cop. If he loses, both Rachel and Adam would stay. As the race begins, Royce drives up to Charlie, demanding that he let him inside so he can go back to the real world. When Royce tries to stab Adam when Charlie refuses, Clara covers his eyes, causing both to crash into a ravine. Just as Hell Cop is about to disable Charlie's car, Rachel finds a switch which releases nitro, propelling their car through the portal winning the race. However, Hell Cop would follow, wanting revenge. As he's about to kill Charlie, Rachel shoots Hell Cop in his shades, causing him to blow up.

Antelope Canyon was also a location. Parts of the film were also shot at Glen Canyon in Utah.  Release  Hemdale shelved the film for a year before finally giving it a limited release. It was released to home video on August 21, 1992. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray February 2, 2016.  Reception  Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Although ambitious, amusing and even romantic, replete with lots of striking sets and jazzy special effects, its humor is not sophisticated enough to attract the wide audiences of a Beetlejuice.\\" Michael Dare of Billboard called it \\"smart, witty, and incredibly imaginative\\". TV Guide rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, \\"Highway to Hell is no masterpiece, but it is a genuine video find.\\" Todd Rigney of Beyond Hollywood called it a \\"deliriously enjoyable satanic road trip\\" film that is \\"fun if you approach it in the right frame of mind\\". HorrorNews.Net called it \\"one of the greatest campy horror films to never arrive on DVD\\". Highway to Hell has since developed a cult following.

Biography √Ålvarez was born in Granada. He joined the army in 1768 (aged 19), and studied at the Military Academy of Barcelona, graduating in 1775. He gained steady promotions, saw action in the siege of Gibraltar in 1783, and by 1793 was a Colonel of Infantry. During the War of the Pyrenees (1793‚Äì1795) against France he took part in many notable actions, was wounded, and spent 75 days under fire at the siege of Collioure. As a result, he was promoted to Brigadier. On the accession of Joseph Bonaparte to the throne of Spain in 1808, √Ålvarez was commander of the castle of Montju√Øc in Barcelona. On 29 February French troops arrived to take possession of the fortress. √Ålvarez was preparing to defend it against them when he received direct orders of his Commander in Chief to hand it over. √Ålvarez fled Barcelona and joined the Spanish rebels against French rule. The Cortes of C√°dizwhich served as a parliamentary Regency after Ferdinand VII was deposednamed √Ålvarez commander of the Army of Catalonia and Governor of Girona. =Siege of Girona= On the 6 May 1809 a French army of 18,000 men besieged the town. √Ålvarez had only 5,600 men under arms. The French mounted 40 gun batteries that over the next seven months fired some 20,000 explosive shells and 60,000 cannonballs into the city. In August, the French captured the castle of Montju√Øc, the main defensive point. Undeterred, √Ålavarez constructed barricades and trenches inside the city and battle raged for another four months before √Ålavarez, exhausted and ill, handed over command to a subordinate. Two days later, on 12 December, the town capitulated. It is estimated that some 10,000 people, soldiers and civilians, had died inside. French losses were around 15,000, over half of those to disease. =Death= In spite of √Ålvarez's poor health, the French imprisoned him at Perpignan. On 9 January 1809 √Ålvarez was brought to the castle of San Fernando in Figueres, where he was found dead the following day, of a fever according to the French, poisoned, according to the Spanish. He was buried, wrapped in only a sheet, in the cemetery there. =Posthumous honours= He was posthumously promoted to Field Marshal in April 1809 and made a Commander of the First Battalion of the Spanish Royal Guards Regiment in May 1810. In 1815 a black marble tablet was placed on his grave which stated that √Ålvarez had been poisoned, and was a Victim of the Iniquity of the French Tyrant. In December 1823 French troops, ironically invading Spain in order to restore the tottering throne of Ferdinand VII, passed through Figueres, and on the orders of Marshal Moncey, formerly Napoleon's Inspector-General of Police, destroyed the plaque. In 1880 a funerary monument, sculpted by Jeronimo Su√±ol, was erected in the Church of San Felix in Girona. In 2010, around the 200th anniversary of his death, an exhibition √Ålvarez de Castro y su tiempo (\\"√Ålvarez de Castro and his times\\") was held in his honour at the castle of San Fernando in Figueres.

It is located along the Paran√° River with two types of beaches: one with shallow depths in which you can basically cross a long stretch of the river and a deep one just within a few meters from the coast. The city has a population of about 1,100. Its name comes from a little hill (cerrito) from which you can see the beautiful landscape of the city and the river. At the top of the hill lied a statue of former Paraguayan president Alfredo Stroessner which was destroyed by a lightning strike just before he was overthrown out of the presidency in 1989. Some believe this event indicated a \\"prediction\\" of the eventual fall of Stroessner. Others say the statue was never hit by lightning, but was actually toppled by the local citizens celebrating Strossener's overthrow. Local residents say the \\"hit-by-lighting\\" story was invented out of embarrassment by local politicians because they belonged to the Colorado Party (Paraguay), same as the disgraced dictator. A lot of Indian tribes inhabit the city, and several pre-Columbine tombs were found in an area that is very hard to reach because of the poor conditions of the dirt roads. The main tourist attraction of this city is the good fishing spots in the river. Fishing guides and camping areas are available. There are also water taxis to take passengers across the river to Argentina. Cerrito is the birthplace of former Paraguay goalkeeper Justo Villar.

Map depicting Battle of Baton Rouge, August 5th 1862.Official Atlas, Plate XXIV. The Battle of Baton Rouge was a ground and naval battle in the American Civil War fought in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, on August 5, 1862. The Union victory halted Confederate attempts to recapture the capital city of Louisiana. Background On April 25, 1862, the day before New Orleans fell to the US Navy fleet under Admiral David Farragut, the Confederate state government decided to abandon Baton Rouge, moving first to Opelousas, and then to Shreveport. All cotton in the area was set afire to prevent it falling into Union hands. On May 9, Navy Commander James S. Palmer of the federal gunboat landed at the town wharf and took possession, without resistance, of the Pentagon Barracks and the arsenal. Two weeks later, a party of guerrillas attacked a rowboat carrying a naval officer. In retaliation, Farragut's flagship, the , bombarded the town, causing civilian casualties and damaging St. Joseph's Church and other buildings. On May 29, US Brigadier General Thomas Williams arrived with six regiments of infantry, two artillery batteries, and a troop of cavalry, and began the occupation of Baton Rouge. During the summer, Major General Earl Van Dorn, commander of Confederate forces east of the Mississippi, resisted a Union bombardment of Vicksburg. The Confederate ironclad ram Arkansas had come down the Yazoo River, inflicting damage on the unprepared Union fleet as she passed through, and was anchored in Vicksburg. Van Dorn desired to regain Baton Rouge. It was thought that re- taking Baton Rouge would be key to driving the Union out of Louisiana, as they could then launch attacks along the Red River on Union-occupied territory, and threaten Union control of New Orleans. 5,000 men entrained from Vicksburg for Camp Moore, led by Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge, on July 27. They were joined by a small infantry division led by Brig. Gen. Daniel Ruggles at the camp. Simultaneously, the Arkansas was sailing down the Mississippi River, en route to engage Union ships near Baton Rouge. The men had a significant amount of mat√©riel, and were well fed. General Williams reportedly had word of the forces' departure from Camp Moore on July 28. On August 4, after information was again received of the imminent arrival of the enemy, Union troops were formed up a mile outside of Baton Rouge. The Union men at Baton Rouge were not experienced, and were in training camp for only two weeks before being sent to Baton Rouge. The troops had few supplies because most were in New Orleans, which was considered more important. Battle Breckinridge moved to the Comite River, east of Baton Rouge, by August 4, and then marched the men closer at night. The Confederates lost the element of surprise when they were discovered by Union sentries. Despite this, the attack was launched at daybreak on August 5. The Union troops were in the center of Baton Rouge, while the Confederates were lined up in two divisions, north of the city. The action occurred around Florida Street, and began with the Confederates pushing their opponents all the way across town. Bitter fighting took place, especially around Magnolia Cemetery. The Union commander, Brigadier General Thomas Williams, was killed in action. Colonel Thomas W. Cahill took over. The colonel led a retreat back to prepared defensive lines near the Penitentiary, under the protection of the Union warships. The Confederate troops began coming under fire from the gunboats. The Confederate ram Arkansas arrived not long after but her engines failed just four miles above the city. Her commander ordered her set afire to prevent her capture. Without any prospect of naval support, Breckenridge was unable to attack the Union positions and withdrew. Union troops evacuated the city a week later, concerned for the safety of New Orleans, but returned that autumn. Confederates occupied Port Hudson, which they held for almost another year. The \\"Battle of Baton Rouge Commemorative Ceremony\\" is held every year on the first Saturday in August in and around Magnolia Cemetery, sponsored by the Foundation for Historical Louisiana.

On August 12, 1970, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. In 1830, a steam- operated sugarcane mill and a sawmill were erected at this site. The mills' masonry buildings were constructed of coquina, a sedimentary rock composed of fossilized tiny mollusc shells, quarried nearby. The structures included a crushing house, with a chimney and large arched doors and window openings, which contained the steam-driven grinding machinery that extracted the juice from the sugarcane. The entire process was carried out using slave labor and draft animals, under the management of the plantation overseer, John Dwight Sheldon. On Christmas Day in 1835, the mills and other buildings were destroyed by Native Americans during the Second Seminole War; only the walls were left standing, with the machinery inside them, made by the West Point Foundry of Cold Spring, New York, mostly undamaged. The site was further altered by soldiers who were garrisoned there to keep the Seminoles under surveillance. History In 1830, William Kemble contracted to build a steam- operated sugarcane mill and a saw mill here for William DePeyster and Henry Cruger, merchant speculators from New York. Eliza Cruger, Henry Cruger's wife, and outside investors financed the construction of the mills on six hundred acres of land near New Smyrna that Cruger bought from an Episcopal minister, Ambrose Hull, who had received it as a grant from the Spanish crown during the Second Spanish period. The land had been part of the original grant made to Andrew Turnbull by the British during their twenty-year occupation of Florida. On December 25, 1835, a band of Seminole Indians pillaged the plantation, after the overseer John Dwight Sheldon, his family, and resident slaves fled to the mainland across the Halifax River. That night the Indians set the sugar mill and other buildings afire. Afterwards, the machinery from the sugar mill was removed and installed at the Dunlawton Sugar Mill. Before coming under the administration of the Florida Park Service as a historic site, the property was commonly believed to be the (non-existent) ruins of the Mission of Atocuimi, a Spanish mission for the Timucua Indians; this false assertion is still propagated by misinformed persons.

Life and career Mackenzie was born in Cromarty, son of A.H. Mackenzie and Isobel Mackay.http://www.ambaile.org/en/literary- landscapes/intermediate.jsp?LiteraryLandscapeID=93 He became a journalist in Glasgow and in 1903 moved to Dingwall as owner and editor of The North Star.http://www.ambaile.org/en/literary- landscapes/intermediate.jsp?LiteraryLandscapeID=93 His next move, in 1910, was to the People's Journal in Dundee. From 1916 he represented the Glasgow paper, The Bulletin, in Edinburgh. As well as writing books, articles and poems, he often gave lectures, and also broadcast talks on Celtic mythology. He was the friend of many specialist authorities in his areas of interest. His older brother was William Mackay Mackenzie, Secretary of the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland between 1913 and 1935. He died in Edinburgh on 2 March 1936 and was buried in Cromarty. Theories =Neolithic matriarchy= In one of his key works, Myths of Crete and Pre- Hellenic Europe (1917), Mackenzie argued that across Europe during Neolithic times, pre-Indo-European societies were matriarchal and woman-centered (gynocentric), where goddesses were venerated but that the Bronze Age Indo- European patriarchal (\\"androcratic\\") culture supplanted it. Mackenzie's matristic theories were notably influential to Marija Gimbutas.\\"The gods and goddesses of Old Europe: 7000 to 3500 BC myths, legends and cult images\\" , University of California Press, 1974, p. 262. He also believed that the Neolithic matriarchy was as far north as Scotland, writing an article in the Celtic Review called \\"A Highland Goddess\\" attempting to trace the very early presence of goddess worship.A Highland Goddess, Donald A. Mackenzie, The Celtic Review, Vol. 7, No. 28, Jan., 1912, pp. 336‚Äì345. =Buddhist diffusionism= Mackenzie was a diffusionist.The Journal of Hellenic Studies, Vol. 46, Part 1, 1926, p. 139. He believed specifically that Buddhists colonised the globe in ancient antiquity and were responsible for spreading the swastika. In his Buddhism in Pre-Christian Britain (1928) he developed the theory that Buddhists were in Britain and Scandinavia long before the spread of Christianity. His main evidence can be summarised as follows:Review: Buddhism in Pre-Christian Britain by Vergilius Ferm, International Journal of Ethics Vol. 39, No. 3, April 1929, pp. 357‚Äì358. *The Gundestrup bowl \\"on which the Celtic god, Cernunnos, is postured like a typical Buddha\\". *Gaulish coins with seated figures like Buddha. *The testimony of Asoka, who launched Buddhist activities into Europe. *Origen's statement of Buddhist doctrines in ancient Britain. The work received a mixed reception. Professor of Philosophy Vergilius Ferm reviewed the work positively, but other scholars criticised it for its lack of evidence.Ferm, 1929, p. 358.Harold H. Bender, American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 33, No. 3, Jul. - Sep., 1929, p. 457. =Racial origin of British= In 1922, Mackenzie published Ancient Man in Britain, a work covering the history of Britain from Upper Paleolithic times, from a strong ethnological basis. The foreword of the book was written by Grafton Elliot Smith. The work covers the earliest settlement of Britain by the first modern humans from around 35,000 years ago during the Aurignacian (pp. 19‚Äì27). In the book, Mackenzie maintains that the Caucasoid Cro-Magnons who settled in Britain were dark haired and dark eyed, racially akin to the French Basques, Iberians and Berbers of North Africa (p. 25), who he theorised were one of the earliest representatives of the Mediterranean race. This indigenous proto- Mediterranean racial stock was later invaded by another \\"variety of the Mediterranean race\\" who initiated the Solutrean culture around 20,000 years ago (p. 50). According to Mackenzie, the Aurignacian and Solutrean peoples of Britain traded in shells with Cro-Magnons of France. They later intermingled with later arriving Caucasoid racial types, including the proto-Alpines (Furfooz race), who were brachycelphalic (broad-skulled) and a Lappid race, who had minor Eskimo phenotypic traits. Mackenzie also believed that there was a highly depigmentated racial type in small numbers in Britain during the Magdalenian, perhaps who were also blonde, who intermingled with the \\"dark Iberians\\" (p. 60). Mackenzie believed that during the Neolithic, the predominant racial type of Britain continued to be Mediterranoid: \\"The carriers of Neolithic culture were in the main Iberians of Mediterranean racial type\\" (p. 126) who traded in pearls and ores. Regarding Bronze Age Britain, Mackenzie devoted several chapters supporting his theory that traders and \\"prospectors\\" (miners) arrived in Britain c. 2500 BC, originally from the Eastern Mediterranean (pp. 98‚Äì101). This theory was initially developed by Harold Peake, who coined the term \\"Prospector Theory\\". In the scientific literature of Carleton S. Coon (1939), the theory was revived, and the Mediterraneans who colonised Britain during the late Neolithic or Bronze Age were associated with the Medway megaliths (or long-barrow Megalithic culture). Joseph Deniker earlier called these colonists \\"Atlanto-Mediterranean\\". Mackenzie believed that these Mediterraneans who colonised parts of Britain survived well into later historic periods (p. 118) and that the Mediterranean race in general was the bulk racial stock of Britain from Paleolithic through to the Neolithic and to more recent periods. They had black or brown hair, and swarthy skin \\"like those of the Southern Italians\\" (p. 126) and have survived in numerous pockets of Britain to the modern day (p. 139) despite that the later Anglo-Saxon and Norse settlement, who were fairer in appearance, Mackenzie believed their genetic input or admixture was very limited but that they subjugated the British imposing a new civilization and culture (p. 227).

Biography James Adams, the son of Parmenio Adams and Cleo Nering, was born on January 24, 1783, at Simsbury, Connecticut. He married Harriet Denton (1787‚Äì1844) in 1809 at Hartford, Connecticut, and later moved to Oswego, New York. He served in the United States Army during the War of 1812. In 1821 he settled in Springfield, Illinois where he became a pioneer attorney of Sangamon County. He was elected justice of the peace in 1823. He served in the Winnebago War in 1827, as well as the Black Hawk War in 1831-1832. Because of his military service he was often addressed as \\"General Adams.\\" He was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Illinois in 1834. He participated in a long-running newspaper battle with Abraham Lincoln beginning in May 1837, over the transfer of a city lot. He was made a probate judge in 1841. He was also longstanding member of the Masonic fraternity. He was the first Worshipful Master of Springfield Lodge No. 4 A.F.& A.M. in Springfield, Illinois in 1839. He also formed the current Grand Lodge of Illinois on April 6, 1840. Association with the Latter-day Saint movement It is not known how Adams came into contact with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but he converted in 1836. He apparently first met Joseph Smith in 1839, when the Latter-day Saint prophet preached in Springfield in November 1839, when he was on his way to Washington, D.C. Adams invited Smith to his home. The meeting of the two resulted in an enduring friendship; upon meeting Adams, Smith wrote in his diary that he \\"treated me like a father.\\"Smith, Joseph, \\"Smith, History, 1838‚Äì1856, vol. C-1\\" p. 972 Upon his conversion Adams became active in local Mormon affairs, serving as the leader of the Springfield Mormon congregation as Branch President. He was also ordained a patriarch by Smith, probably in 1843; a few of his patriarchal blessings have survived from that year. As the Deputy Grand Master of the Masonic Grand Lodge of Illinois (1840 to 1843), he was instrumental in establishing Freemasonry among the Mormons, participating in the installation of the Nauvoo Masonic Lodge in 1842. Eventually, Adams' friendship with Smith brought him into the Mormon prophet's inner circle, those whom he initiated into Nauvoo's most sacred doctrines practices. Even though Adams resided in Springfield, Smith invited him to come to Nauvoo so that he would be included among those men first to receive the endowment, a Mormon temple ritual. He was the only person among the group not from Nauvoo. On May 4, 1842, Smith introduced the ceremony to Adams and eight men, who formed the nucleus of the Anointed Quorum. Until Smith's death in 1844 he brought others into this elite group, admitting both men and women, until it included over fifty persons. Adams' wife, Harriet, was endowed and admitted into the Anointed Quorum on October 8, 1843. Adams attended the group's meetings whenever he was in Nauvoo. Smith also included Adams in Nauvoo's most clandestine and controversial practice, eternal marriage and polygamy. On the day (May 28, 1843) that Smith was sealed to his wife, Emma, in eternal marriage, Smith also sealed Adams' for time and eternity. This was not the end of Adams' eternal marriages. Five weeks later, July 11, Smith performed a plural marriage sealing for 38-year-old Roxanna Rephsire to Adams. Upon an appointment to Hancock County's probate court in 1843, Adams prepared to move to Nauvoo, a move that would bring him into even closer association with Smith. In the midst of his preparations he contracted cholera and died suddenly on August 11, 1843 in Springfield, Illinois. His remains were interred in the Old Pioneer Cemetery, Nauvoo, Illinois. Harriet followed her husband, passing away a year later (August 21, 1844) at Springfield, where she was interred.

He was known for his powerful shots and creative play, his long-range efforts being dubbed Tikotazo.Goals with their own name: Tikotazos, Athletic Bilbao, 6 April 2020 Over 12 professional seasons he played mainly for Athletic Bilbao, appearing in 230 official games for his main club (nearly 200 in La Liga) and scoring 26 goals. Club career Born in Pamplona, Navarre, Tiko emerged through the ranks of hometown club CA Osasuna, alternating between the A and B-sides for some time, with the former competing in the second division. His professional debut came on 10 May 1997, as he scored an injury time-winner away against CD Badajoz (1‚Äì0). In 1999‚Äì2000, Tiko signed with neighbours Athletic Bilbao, making his La Liga debut on 12 October 1999 in a 4‚Äì3 away victory over M√°laga CF. He made 20 appearances all competitions comprised during the campaign, netting once. From 2001 to 2006, Tiko was an undisputed starter in midfield for the Basques, often scoring from free kicks and dictating his team's play. In his final two seasons he was severely hampered by injuries and the emergence of Carlos Gurpegui and Javi Mart√≠nez, playing only a combined seven league matches. In August 2008, deemed surplus to requirements, Tiko joined second level side SD Eibar on a one-year loan deal. He was immediately released upon his return to Athletic following the former's relegation, and retired from the game shortly after at the age of 33. After his playing days ended, Tiko embarked on a career as a coach. In 2015, he joined the staff of Athletic Bilbao's reserves under former Osasuna teammate Jos√© √Ångel Ziganda; in 2017 he became assistant manager of CD Basconia (the former club's farm team), working with Ander Ala√±a. International career Tiko topped a brilliant 2001‚Äì02 (32 games, seven goals) with his sole cap for Spain, playing in a friendly with the Netherlands on 27 March 2002 as the nation lost 0‚Äì1 in Rotterdam. Personal life Tiko's younger brother, Francisco, was also a footballer and a midfielder. He played exclusively in the lower leagues, also representing Osasuna B. Tiko's uncle Patxi was also involved in the sport, also playing as a midfielder and also beginning his career at Osasuna before moving to Athletic Bilbao.

The village lies on the west bank of the White Cart Water, and the original settlement grew up around a farm, mill and smithy. One early record of the village is in Timothy Pont's maps of Scotland (1583‚Äì1596). Waterfoot today is purely residential in character, having expanded as a commuter dormitory village, primarily in the latter half of the 20th century. The 2011 census reported that Waterfoot had a population of 1,280. There was some controversy in 2012 when East Renfrewshire Council wanted to sell Waterfoot Park to the housebuilder CALA Homes so that they could build 29 homes. A new park, Inky Pink Park, was created using funds provided by CALA to mitigate for the loss of Waterfoot Park when it was built on.

It first opened in 1959 and features two separate tracks: Kil-Kare Speedway, a 3/8 mile (0.6 km) asphalt oval for stock car racing and Kil-Kare Dragway, a 1/4 mile dragstrip. The oval is unconventional in shape, with the cars almost in a continuous slide between turns one and four. The facility is affiliated with both the NHRA and NASCAR and holds events in the Whelen All- American Series as well as local events including figure 8 races. It formerly hosted races in ARCA and USAR Pro Cup Series competition. The name Kil Kare is believed to be derived from an old resort that once stood on the property currently occupied by the raceway. The Creekside Trail bicycle path, which borders the raceway to the south, was once the Columbus and Xenia Railroad. The railroad carried passenger trains near the turn of the 20th century. The passenger trains stopped at the resort that was named \\"Kill all your cares\\". As time progressed, the resort closed, the railroad was dismantled, and the name Kil-Kare, which was formed from the name of the resort, stuck. The 1/4 mile drag strip at Kil-Kare underwent a major renovation in 2013 which included tearing up the old asphalt surface and replacing it with concrete for the entire length of the strip. Kil-Kare is one of few in the country that features a concrete racing surface for the entire 1/4 mile length. Kil Kare Raceway is operational as of the 2015 season.

The primary evidence is scattered archaeological finds, which are often damaged or incomplete. There are similarities of form and function between them. Helmet types H. Russell Robinson in his book The Armour of Imperial Rome, published in 1975, classified into broad divisions the various forms of helmets that were found.

While the fur is usually red, the crests possibly occurred in other colors, like yellow, purple and black, and possibly in combinations of these colors such as alternating yellow and black. Gladiators such as the samnis and the hoplomachus also probably wore large feathered crests. There is some evidence (Vegetius writings and some sculptures) that legionaries had their crests mounted longitudinally and centurions had them mounted transversely.

It is today the only horse-racing club in Singapore and is part of the Malayan Racing Association (MRA), which also regulates the three Turf Clubs in Malaysia, the Selangor Turf Club, Penang Turf Club and Perak Turf Club. The Singapore Turf Club is the only authorised operator of horse racing, and totalisator (horse betting) services in Singapore. It is the agent and proprietary club of the Tote Board, Singapore, who manages and directs its donation of surplus funds for charitable purposes. The first race was held on 23 February 1843 when prize money on offer was only $150 . In 1924, the Club changed its name to the Singapore Turf Club. The Club moved to Bukit Timah in 1933 before relocating to its present location at the Singapore Racecourse at Kranji in 1999. The racecourse is adjacent to Kranji MRT station.  Racing  Racing is staged all year round on almost every Friday and Sunday. Most of the 100-odd race meetings are restricted to locally trained horses, except for the two International races in May, the Singapore Airlines International Cup and the KrisFlyer International Sprint, and certain cross-border races open to Malaysian-based horses. Since there is no breeding industry in Singapore, all its thoroughbred bloodstock is imported from overseas, primarily from Australia and New Zealand, while a minority comes from other countries like Japan, England, Ireland, France, South Africa, America and Germany. Horse owners, made up of both Singaporeans and foreigners, purchase horses and send them to any of the 26 trainers currently licensed at Kranji. Currently, there are 14 expatriates and 12 local trainers. The pool of jockeys available consists mainly of locally trained jockeys and apprentices all licensed by the MRA and around 10 expatriate jockeys, whose licences are granted by the Singapore Turf Club over a specific period of time (as short as one-day for short-term licences and from three months to one year for longer-term licences). All licences are subject to renewal depending on performances and conduct.  Major Races  = Singapore Airlines International Cup and KrisFlyer International Sprint = The S$3 million Group 1 Singapore Airlines International Cup (SAIC), was first held in 2000 in conjunction with the opening of the Singapore Racecourse at Kranji. It is held in May, coupled with its sister sprint race, the S$1 million Group 1 KrisFlyer International Sprint run over 1200 metres. Both events are part of the Singapore International Racing Festival (SIRF), which is attended by some of the world's top owners, jockeys and trainers, and are International Group 1 races open to horses from around the world. In 2011, the KrisFlyer became the fourth leg of the Global Sprint Challenge. = Singapore Gold Cup = The Singapore Gold Cup is considered as the most prestigious race on the Singapore racing calendar and is traditionally held at the end of November. Contested on turf, the domestic Group 1 handicap race is run over a distance of 2200 metres and is open to horses aged three and older. The Singapore Gold Cup is the third leg of the Singapore Triple Crown, after the Kranji Mile and the Raffles Cup. First run in 1924 at the Serangoon Road Race Course at Farrer Park, the race's first winner was Thelasocrete, winning $1,600 as prize money. In history of the handicap race, trainer Ivan Allan holds the record for the most successes, having saddled up the winner on nine occasions. Jerry Sung, owner of Auric Stables, as an owner, won the Cup five times. In 1958, Abdul Mawi became the first local jockey to win the Gold Cup. In 2008, El Dorado became the first Japanese-bred horse trained in Singapore to win the Gold Cup and he then doubled the feat by landing the race the next year (2009), to become the first horse to do so since Grenadier in 1965 and 1966. To mark its move from Bukit Timah to Kranji in 1999, the Singapore Turf Club raised the prize money to $1 million and opened the race to international contenders, but the race returned to domestic status three years later. The prize money for the Group 1 event has since been raised to $1.35 million. In 2010-2015, Swiss watchmaker Longines became the official partner and timekeeper of the Singapore Turf Club, and the race was renamed ‚ÄúLongines Singapore Gold Cup‚Äù. In 2016, the Singapore Gold Cup was renamed to \\"Dester Singapore Gold Cup\\" with a new sponsor, Lubritrade Distribution. Lubritrade owns the premium beer brand, Dester 100% Malt. = Singapore Derby = The Emirates Singapore Derby is held every mid-July. This race is staged on turf and is contested over 2000 metres. The race is open to four-year-old racehorses only and carries a prize pool of $1 million. The race was known as the Singapore Derby until 1995, when Dubai- based Emirates Airlines embarked with a partnership with Singapore Turf Club. Inaugurated in 1880 at the Serangoon Road Race Course in Farrer Park, it was regularly conducted there until 1910 when it was cancelled. It was not until 1959 that the Singapore Derby was resurrected by the Singapore Turf Club. Since then it has been staged at the Bukit Timah Racecourse until 1999 when the Club relocated the Singapore Racecourse at Kranji. Since its inception the race has been contested over various distances close to 2400 metres until 1998 when the distance was set at 2000 metres. Trainer Ivan Allan has won the Derby nine times, a record which may never be surpassed. The Auric Stable has registered the most wins in the Derby ‚Äì five times in 1970, 1975, 1990, 1995 and 1996, while Australian jockey Johnny Wilson holds the record of most wins with three (1963, 1972 and 1975). November Sun, Feu Vert and Courtline Jester are the only horses to have won the Derby twice. The Singapore Derby is now the third Leg of the Singapore Four-Year Challenge after the Stewards‚Äô Cup and the Patron's Bowl. Japanese mare Jolie's Shinju is the last horse to have won all three Legs (2009), though the first two Legs were then slated as the Patron's Bowl and the Singapore Derby Trial. = Lion City Cup = The Lion City Cup was launched in 1974 and is widely considered Singapore's premier domestic sprint race. It is held in April. The domestic Group 1 race is run over a distance of 1200 metres and is open to horses aged three and older. War Plan's Cup win in 1990 was beamed \\"live\\" to Hong Kong and in turn local racegoers were treated to a telecast of the Hong Kong Derby. At its new home at Kranji, Superb Effect scored consecutive wins in 2000 and 2001. It was then the turn of another Charles Leck-trained sprinter Classic Marco who took the honours in 2002. Que Expresion became the first Argentinian-bred horse to win the Cup in 2003. Singapore's sprinter Rocket Man holds the record of most wins. His name was added to the roll of honour four times with wins recorded consecutively from 2009 to 2012. = Raffles Cup = The Raffles Cup is the second Leg of the Singapore Triple Crown Challenge and is normally held in October at Kranji. Run on turf over 1800m, the domestic Group 1 race is open to horses aged three years old and older. Named after Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of Singapore, the Raffles Cup was first run in 1991 at the old Bukit Timah Race Course with its distance first pegged at 1600m before it was raised to 1800m in 2001. Though it has only a relatively short history, many top gallopers have inscribed their names to the Raffles Cup roll of honour. The most notable horses include Ouzo (1999), Smart Bet (2002), Zirna (2003) and most recently Better Than Ever (2010). Trainer Teh Choon Beng boasts the highest rate of success in the Raffles Cup having won the race four times in 1991, 1993, 1994 and 1995. Jockeys Kim Clapperton (1993 to 1995) and Saimee Jumaat (1999, 2008 and 2010) are joint leaders with three wins apiece.  Betting  All wagering on both Singapore and simulcast races is operated and administered by the Singapore Turf Club on behalf of the Singapore Totalisator Board, using an electronic Pari-Mutuel system. Bets can be placed through the following manners: * Betting counters at the Singapore Turf Club Racecourse at Kranji on raceways. * Betting counters at nine Off Course Betting Centres and four Off Course Betting Outlets * Singapore Pools Branches (including LiveWire and SportsBuzz) * Self-Betting Kiosks * Telebet account holders using TeleTote, MobileTote, Electronic Fund Transfer and AXS, Winners‚Äô Touch System or calling directly via Operator-Assisted Betting. Governed by its own set of Rules and Regulations, Singapore Turf Club offers bets such as Win, Place, Roll Win, Forecast, Place Forecast, Tierce, Trio, Quartet and Quadro. Singapore Turf Club also takes part in commingling. Commingling of pools is the process where one totalisator organisation combines its wagering pool with another to create one common dividend. In January 2009, the Singapore Totalisator pool combined with Tabcorp Australia's Victorian pool.  Events and Entertainment  The Open Day \\"Fun For All Under The Stars\\" invites people under 18 years of age (the age limit for admission to the races) to experience the world of horse racing. Barrier trials are held and no wagering is offered on such nights. Other regularly held events that fall outside the main business core of horse racing include the Singapore Symphony Orchestra concerts, Ladies‚Äô Night (including fashion shows) and Horseshoe Pitching contest (during the Singapore International Racing Festival in May), among others. The venue also rents for corporate functions and other events.  Facilities  Training amenities at the Kranji Racecourse include a swimming pool, treadmills, horse walkers and a total of seven tracks of both turf, synthetic tracks (Polytrack and Tapeta) as well as sand. The latest addition to the tracks was a 1000m long uphill track (Polytrack) completed in February 2010. Taking into account Singapore's wet weather, all tracks utilise an underground drainage network which minimises waterlogging by draining off the rainwater to maintain a safe racing surface at all times. The club also operates an equine hospital, the Singapore Turf Club Veterinary Hospital. The hospital was renovated in 2013.  Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)  The Singapore Turf Club is a non-profit organisation and any surplus revenue is donated to charitable organisations. The club has adopted Melrose Home as its charity since 2016. It had also previously adopted Thye Hua Kwan EIPIC Centre at Woodlands and Club Rainbow.  Sponsorships  Various companies act as sponsors to some feature races in Singapore, including Singapore Airlines (Singapore Airlines International Cup and KrisFlyer International Sprint), Longines (Singapore Gold Cup), Emirates Airline (Singapore Derby), Panasonic (Kranji Mile) and Magic Millions, Inglis, Aushorse and IRT (Singapore Golden Horseshoe series) and Japan Bloodhorse Breeders‚Äô Association (Moonbeam Vase) among others.  Riding Centre  The Singapore Turf Club also runs a subsidiary equestrian riding centre, which was opened on 24 June 2010 and was used as the exclusive site for the equestrian event of the 2010 Youth Olympic Games.

Growing numbers of cotton plantations increased the settlement's population greatly. It became a city and capital in 1821.  Early history  Osceola Tallahassee is situated within the Apalachee Province, home of the Apalachee, a Mississippian culture of agrarian people who farmed vast tracts of land. Their capital, Anhaica, was located within Tallahassee's city limits. The name \\"Tallahassee\\" is a Muskogean Indian word often translated as \\"old fields\\", or \\"old town.\\" This may stem from the Creek (later called Seminole) Indians that migrated into this region in the 18th century. The Apalachee's success as agriculturalists did not go unnoticed by the Spanish, who sent missionaries to the area throughout the 17th century. Several mission sites were established with the aim of procuring food and labor for the colony at St. Augustine. One of the most important mission sites, Mission San Luis de Apalachee, has been partially reconstructed as a state historic site in Tallahassee.  Spanish period (16th century to 1821)  The Spanish missionaries were not the first Europeans to visit Tallahassee, however. The Spanish explorer, Hernando de Soto spent the winter of 1538-1539 encamped at the Apalachee village of Anhaica, which he had taken by force. De Soto's brutal treatment of the natives was fiercely resisted, and by the following spring De Soto was eager to move on. The site of Anhaica, near present-day Myers Park, was located in 1987 by Florida archaeologist B. Calvin Jones. Anhaica, in the early period of Spanish colonization, was the capital of the Apalachee Province (of Spanish Florida). It was burned on March 31, 1818, by General Andrew Jackson, at the onset of the First Seminole War.  19th century  = Becoming capital = The founding of Tallahassee was largely a matter of convenience. In 1821, Florida was ceded by Spain to the United States. A territorial government was established, but the impracticalities of alternately meeting in St. Augustine and Pensacola, the two largest cities in the territory at the time (the Spaniards had built a road), led territorial governor William Pope Duval to appoint two commissioners to establish a more central meeting place. In October 1823, John Lee Williams of Pensacola and Dr. William Simmons of St. Augustine selected the former Indian settlement of Tallahassee, roughly midway between the two cities, as a suitable place. Their decision was also based on its elevation and location near a beautiful waterfall, now part of Cascades Park, and the old capital of the Apalachee chiefdom, Anhaica, burned by Andrew Jackson in 1818. Neamathla, a Creek chief, was living there in a new town called Cohowofooche. In October 1823, Williams and Simmons met with Neamathla to tell him of the new territory's plan to locate its capital in Tallahassee. Neamathla objected but gave his grudging approval with the stipulation they not tell other Seminoles of his consent. A year later, Neamathla threatened to make the streets of Tallahassee \\"run red with blood,\\" unless the white settlers left. \\"DuVal, backed by a regiment of U.S. Army soldiers, met with Neamathla and his 600 warriors. DuVal illegally deposed Neamathla as head of the Seminoles, and ordered the Indians to a reservation near Tampa.\\" In March of the following year it was formally proclaimed the capital. Florida did not become a state, however, until 1845 (Tebeau:122). On November 1, 1823, John Lee Williams wrote to Florida congressional delegate (and later governor) Richard Keith Call about the location of the capital: = Founding of Tallahassee = In 1824, the City of Tallahassee, the county seat and only incorporated city in Leon County, was established following a decision by the state legislature to locate the capital of the new Florida Territory midway between the population centers of St. Augustine and Pensacola. The city was not formally incorporated until December 1825, with the first municipal elections being held in January 1826. In 1824, General Marquis de Lafayette was awarded a land grant by the United States Congress. The grant consisted of a by square of land in what is today mostly northeast Tallahassee. Although the Marquis never visited his property in Florida, he sent people to grow limes and olives and to produce silk from moths. However, the colony failed, and most of the residents went to New Orleans or back to France. Those who remained lived in an area of Tallahassee that still is called Frenchtown. Lafayette eventually sold his property. In 1826, Prince Achille Murat, nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, moved to the Tallahassee area, most likely in response to the July 4, 1825 Lafayette Land Grant, which also attracted many other French settlers. He purchased land in Jefferson County, Florida and named it Lipona Plantation. \\"Lipona\\" is an anagram for Napoli, the Italian spelling of Naples, Italy, where he was to rule. The following outline represents a brief historical sketch of the area: In 1827, Ralph Waldo Emerson, after a visit, called Tallahassee \\"A grotesque place of land speculators and desperados.\\" Emerson would become a great friend and confidant of the aforementioned Achille Murat for years. = 1830s =  First bank  Union Bank of Tallahassee Brown's Inn in 1834. Around 1830, the Union Bank, Tallahassee's first bank, was established by William Williams. The Seminole Wars, unsound banking practices, and the Panic of 1837 caused the closing of the bank in 1843. In 1847, the bank was purchased by cotton plantation owners William Bailey and Issac Mitchell. It later became a Freedman (negro) bank from after the Civil War until 1879. The building has been used as a church, feed store, art house, coffee house, dance studio, locksmith's shop, beauty shop, and shoe factory. In 1971 the bank was moved from the original site on the west side of Adams Street, between College Avenue and Park Avenue, to just east of the Capitol on Apalachee Parkway and Calhoun Avenue.  Capitol building  The rough hewn frontier capital gradually grew into a town during Florida's territorial period. In anticipation of becoming a state, the territorial government erected a greek revival masonry structure that would befit a state capitol. The structure opened in 1845 in time for statehood and eventually become known as the \\"old Capitol\\" which stands in front of the current new capitol high rise today.  Tallahassee-St. Marks Railroad  In 1834, the Tallahassee Railroad was constructed, connecting St. Marks with Tallahassee to facilitate shipping of cotton to northeastern ports. It is reported to be the third oldest railroad in the United States. Three years later, it was extended to Port Leon, briefly the county seat of Wakulla County until it was destroyed by hurricane. In 1856 the mule-drawn line, with wooden rails, was replaced with steel rails and steam locomotives. The route has been paved and is today the Tallahassee-St. Marks Historic Railroad State Trail.http://www.traillink.com/trail/tallahassee---st-marks-historic-railroad- state-trail.aspx, consulted 6/5/2015. Also in 1834, Thomas Brown, who would later serve as Florida's governor, built an inn called Brown's Inn, located on the west side of Adams Street between Pensacola and Lafayette streets. = 1840s = The Floridian newspaper reported in 1840 that the Great Florida Mail route (\\"previously sent by the Alligator Route\\") connected Tallahassee (Port Leon), via steamboats and stagecoaches, with Apalachcola, Pensacola, and Mobile, Alabama to the west, and St. Augustine, Brunswick, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina on the east. The trip from Mobile was 3 1/2 days \\"in favorable weather\\", and the fare $26.50.  Reform mayor  Florida Capitol Building 1845 In 1841, Francis W. Eppes, grandson of Thomas Jefferson and a successful cotton plantation owner became Intendant mayor of Tallahassee. Eppes served as mayor until 1844. Eppes described the town's Marion Race Course \\"A hotbed of vice, intemperance, gambling and profanity.\\" He held that the rest of the town was little better. Eppes would again serve from 1856‚Äì1857. = 1850s = During the antebellum period, Tallahassee was at the center of the fast-growing \\"middle counties\\" of Florida, which held the bulk of the antebellum state population. For several decades before the Civil War, nearby Gadsden County was the most populous in the state. Cotton and tobacco plantations and smaller farms were the main draw for population growth as well as economic and political power. Many cotton plantations such as the William Bailey Plantation, Barrow Hill, Francis Eppes Plantation, La Grange Plantation were built within what is now Tallahassee. = 1860s =  Civil War  Florida Capitol Building 1902 Tallahassee was the only Confederate state capital east of the Mississippi not captured by Union forces during the Civil War, and the only one not burned. The Battle of Natural Bridge was fought outside Tallahassee, mostly by students of what would later become Florida State University, which is the only non-military academy or service academy school to have such a claim. = Reconstruction = Following the Civil War, much of Florida's industry shifted to the south and east, a trend that continues to this day. The end of slavery caused the cotton and tobacco trades to suffer, and the state's major industry shifted to citrus, naval stores, cattle ranching, and even tourism, all of which occurred to the south and east due to climate and geography. This growth was especially noticeable around the Jacksonville area and the St. Johns River. At the same time, newly freed blacks created Frenchtown, the oldest historically black neighborhood in the state. =1880s= First university In January 1883 Reverend John Kost, A.M., M.D., LL.D of Michigan proposed to carry out the mandate of the 1868 Constitution requiring a state university. Kost selected Tallahassee and the West Florida Seminary for the location of the university. Classes were held at the West Florida Seminary from 1857 until 1863, when the state legislature changed the name to The Florida Military and Collegiate Institute to reflect the addition of a military section which trained cadets. The university was called the Florida State College for Women and later called the Florida State University. On October 3, 1887, the State Normal College for Colored Students began classes, and became a land grant university four years later when it received $7,500 under the Second Morrill Act, and its name was changed to State Normal and Industrial College for Colored Students. However, it was not an official institution of higher learning until the 1905 Buckman Act, which transferred control from the Department of Education to the Board of Control, creating what was the foundation for the modern Florida A&M; University. Capital City Bank Dry goods store owner George W. Saxon began making loans to farmers during the 1880s which led him to filing for a bank charter in 1895. The bank grew and by 1975, Saxon's great grandson and bank director, DuBose Ausley, began formation of several banks into one group. Capital City Bank now has 70 banking offices and serves people as far north as Valley, Alabama and Macon, Georgia to Port Richey, Florida in the south.  Carrabelle, Tallahassee and Georgia Railroad  During the 1880s and 1890s Tallahassee was served by the Carrabelle, Tallahassee and Georgia Railroad, which ran from Georgia to Tallahassee and on to Carabelle in Franklin County. St. James and Leon Hotels The St. James Hotel was constructed sometime during the 1870‚Äî1883 period. It was a 3-story hotel with a porch wrapping two sides, located on the corner Monroe Street and Jefferson Street. The St. James became the Bloxham House from 1909‚Äì1913. Moved to 410 N. Calhoun Street, this building possesses both local and statewide significance, having served as the residence for Governors William D. Bloxham and Madison S. Perry from 1881‚Äì1901. It is also Tallahassee's finest remaining example of Federal residential architecture. In 1980 the Florida Heritage Foundation oversaw the restoration of this building. In 1881, the Leon Hotel was constructed at 110 East Park Avenue. A Victorian style 2-story building, it had ornate porches on both first and second floors with sprawling grounds. The Leon was destroyed by fire in 1925. Gallery File:Leon Hoteln042295.jpgLeon Hotel, 1910  20th century  Throughout much of the 20th century, Tallahassee remained a sleepy government and college town, where politicians would meet to discuss spending money on grand public improvement projects to accommodate growth in places such as Miami and Tampa, hundreds of miles away from the capital. By 1901, the infrastructure development continued to trend growth to the south, first by the Plant System Railroads to the fledgling port of Tampa and then the Flagler railroad to the remote outpost of Miami. However, Tallahassee was firmly entrenched as capital and in that year the 1845 capitol building was expanded with two new wings, and a small dome. = 1900 to 1930 = In 1905, Florida State College became a women's school called the Florida Female College and, in 1909, the name of the college was changed to Florida State College for Women. In 1919, The Florida Legislature passed a new city charter for Tallahassee, authorizing a Commission-Manager form of government. The position of directly elected mayor ended and a system of rotation among city commissioners for mayor began. The Floridan Hotel was constructed opened May 2, 1927 on the corner of Monroe Street and Call Street. It became the home of state legislators during legislative sessions and it has been said that more of Florida's business took place in the Floridan than in the Florida Capitol. The Tallahassee Rotary Club met in the Floridan during this decade. The Floridan was demolished in 1985. The 4-story Cherokee Hotel was constructed in 1922 at Park Ave and Calhoun St. In 1928, the City of Tallahassee purchased a tract of land for $7,028 for its first municipal airport. It was named Dale Mabry Field in honor of Tallahassee native Army Captain Dale Mabry. The airport was dedicated on November 11, 1929 with its first manager being Ivan Munroe. = 1930 to 1950 = In 1931, the Lively Vocational Technical School was established and is still in existence on Appleyard Drive. In 1947, the legislature returned Florida State College for Women to coeducational status, founding the Florida State University. Musician and entertainer Ray Charles made Tallahassee his part-time home. Charles began sitting in with the Florida A&M; University student band and playing with jazz brothers Nat Adderley and Cannonball Adderley.Lydon, Michael, Ray Charles: Man and Music, Routledge, , Routledge Publishing, January 22, 2004. = 1950s =  Tallahassee bus boycott  Reverend C. K. Steele and Edwin Norwood On May 26, 1956, two Florida A&M; University students were arrested by the Tallahassee Police Department because they refused to give up their seats next to a white passenger. They were charged with \\"inciting a riot\\", though the white woman they sat next to made no objection. The next night a cross was burned outside their rooming house. Carrie Patterson, a FAMU junior, was a 21-year-old wife and mother from the small town of Lakeland, Florida. She was able to return home just twice a year. Wilhemina Jakes, a FAMU senior, was a 26-year-old born in Hardeeville, South Carolina and was from West Palm Beach, Florida. Both young women were studying elementary education at FAMU. Rev. C. K. Steele and Robert Saunders representing the NAACP began talks while blacks started boycotting the city's buses. This boycott was similar to that in the Montgomery bus boycott with Rosa Parks. Former bus patrons began a car pool lasting through May 26, 1957, several other events took place which would change segregation in Tallahassee. The Inter-Civic Council ended the boycott on December 3, 1956. On January 7, 1957, the City Commission repealed the bus- franchise segregation clause because of a recent federal ruling that outlaws segregated buses in Florida. Tallahassee's bus terminal would later be named after Steele. In 1959, Betty Jean Owens, an African-American woman, was brutally raped by four white men in Tallahassee. The trial of Owens' rapists was significant in Florida, and the South as a whole, because the white men were given life sentences for their crimes. This severe of a sentencing had not occurred for white men in the South accused of raping black women previous to Owens' case.McGuire, Danielle L. At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape, and Resistance- a New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to the Rise of Black Power. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010. Print. Pg 139 = 1960s =  Civil Rights Protests  On March 16, 1960 the Tallahassee Police Department used tear gas to break up a student protest demonstration in the city. Protesters also attempted a boycott of The Mecca, a popular eatery across from the gate of Florida State University. In 1963, orchestra leader Count Basie was refused service at the restaurant after performing at Florida State, which precipitated a protest in which Basie participated. Similar protests were launched against McCrory's, Woolworth's, Walgreens, and Sears. For more information, see below, History of Tallahassee, Florida#Black history. = The new capitol building = Florida Capitol Building under construction By the 1960s, there was a movement to move the capital to Orlando closer geographically to the growing population centers of the state. That motion was defeated however, and the 1970s saw a long-term commitment by the state to the capital city with construction of the new capitol complex and preservation of the old capitol building. In 1961, Tallahassee Regional Airport is opened. =First subdivision= In 1964, Killearn Estates became Tallahassee's first planned community. Formed from land owned by the Coble family and known as Velda Farms, it was unusual in that it had underground utilities preserving a natural appearance. =Tallahassee Community College= In 1966, The Tallahassee Community College was established just west of what was Dale Mabry Field. TCC would grow and educate over 14,000 students per semester. = 1970s =  Ted Bundy  On January 9, 1978, serial killer Ted Bundy arrived in Tallahassee from Atlanta by bus. While in Tallahassee, Bundy rented a room at a boarding house under the alias of \\"Chris Hagen\\". Bundy went on a spree committing numerous petty crimes including shoplifting, purse snatching, and auto theft. In the early hours of Super Bowl Sunday on January 15, 1978, he bludgeoned to death two sleeping women, Lisa Levy and Margaret Bowman, and seriously wounded Karen Chandler and Kathry Kleiner inside their Florida State University Chi Omega sorority house. He then clubbed and severely injured another young woman, Cheryl Thomas, in her home a few blocks away. On February 15, Bundy stole an orange VW Bug belonging to Rick Garzaniti of Tallahassee. Bundy was stopped shortly after 1 a.m. by Pensacola police officer David Lee. When the officer called in a check of Bundy's license plate it was proven to be stolen. Bundy scuffled with Lee before finally being subdued. Bundy was found guilty of these and other murders and was executed January 24, 1989.  Recent history  Tallahassee has seen an uptick in growth in recent years, mainly in government and research services associated with the state and Florida State University. However, a growing number of retirees are finding Tallahassee an attractive alternative to South Florida's high housing prices and urban sprawl. = 1990s = In 1997, Tallahassee citizens selected Scott Maddox as their first directly elected mayor since 1919. = 2000s = The U.S. presidential election of 2000 between Al Gore and George W. Bush would play out to a great degree in Tallahassee. Bush won the election night vote count in Florida by a little over 1000 votes. Florida state law provided for an automatic recount due to the small margins. The closeness of the election was clear and both the Bush and Gore campaigns organized themselves for the ensuing legal process. The Bush campaign hired George H. W. Bush's former Secretary of State James Baker to oversee their legal team, and the Gore campaign hired Bill Clinton's former Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Tallahassee attorneys W. Dexter Douglass and John Newton. The Gore campaign, as allowed by Florida statute, requested that disputed ballots in four counties be counted by hand. Florida statutes also required that all counties certify and report their returns, including any recounts, by 5 p.m. on November 14. At 4:00 p.m. EST on December 8, the Florida Supreme Court, by a 4 to 3 vote, ordered a manual recount, under the supervision of the Leon County Circuit Court, of disputed ballots in all Florida counties and the portion of Miami-Dade county in which such a recount was not already complete. That decision was announced on live worldwide television by the Florida Supreme Court's spokesman Craig Waters, the Court's public information officer. The Court further ordered that only undervotes be considered. The results of this tally were to be added to the November 14 tally. This count was in progress on December 9, when the United States Supreme Court 5-4 (Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer dissenting) granted Bush's emergency plea for a stay of the Florida Supreme Court recount ruling, stopping the incomplete recount. = 2010s = In 2016, Hurricane Hermine swept through the city, knocking out power to 80% of the city, including Florida State University, and bringing down trees. This was the first hurricane to make a direct hit on the city since Hurricane Kate in 1985. Black history =Slavery followed by segregation= Tallahassee has a strong black history. Before the Civil War Leon County led the state in cotton production,Larry E. Rivers, \\"Slavery in Microcosm: Leon County, Florida, 1824 to 1860\\", The Journal of Negro History, Vol. 66, No. 3 (Autumn, 1981), pp. 235-245, at page 240, https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716918, retrieved 6/5/2015. and had the greatest cluster of plantations in the state. (See Plantations of Leon County.) Centrally-located Tallahassee‚Äîonly north Florida had any significant population‚Äîwas the center of Florida's slave trade.Smith, p. 28. In 1860, Leon County's population was 73% black, almost all of them slaves;Rivers, p. 237. Smith, p. 26, gives 74%. there were more slaves in Leon County than in any other county in Florida.Julia Floyd Smith, Slavery and Plantation Growth in Antebellum Florida 1821-1860, Gainesville, University of Florida Press, 1973, , p. 26, and Appendix B, \\"Excerpts from County Tax Books in Florida Showing Ownership in Acreage and Slaves\\", pp. 213-222. (Adjacent Gadsden County is according to the 2010 census the only county in Florida with a majority African-American population.) In addition, and the two facts are loosely linked, it is the site of the state's largest and only public historically black institution of higher education, Florida A&M; University, founded in 1877 as the State Normal (four years later, Normal and Industrial) College for Colored Students. (Legislation leading to its creation was introduced by former abolitionist and Superintendent of Public Instruction Jonathan C. Gibbs, who was elected a Tallahassee city councilman in 1872.) According to the 2010 Census, Tallahassee's population is 34% black,\\"Tallahassee Population and Demographics\\", http://tallahassee.areaconnect.com/statistics.htm, consulted 5/25/2015.\\"Tallahassee, Florida\\", http://blackcityinfo.com/florida/florida-tallahassee.html, consulted 5/25/2015. whereas Florida as a whole is 17% black.\\"State & County QuickFacts\\", U.S. Census Bureau, http/::quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/12000.htm, consulted 5/25/2015. Juneteenth (commemoration of the Emancipation Proclamation) is celebrated on May 20 of each year, at the Knott House (run by the Museum of Florida History), where the proclamation was read on May 20, 1865.\\"Emancipation Celebration at the Knott House - Festival of Freedom\\", Tallahassee Downtown, May 20, 2014, http://www.tallahasseedowntown.com/events/emancipation- celebration-knott-house-festival-freedom , retrieved 5/25/2015.

Eaton, Sr., Southeastern Regional Black Archives Research Center and Museum. Like other Southern cities, Tallahassee was segregated from the end of Reconstruction until the early 1970s; the closing of the underfunded Florida A&M; Hospital in 1971 is a good marking point for the end of segregation in Tallahassee. Tallahassee's rigid segregation led to its nickname of \\"Little Mississippi\\",Unsigned, \\"Tallahassee, Florida, students sit-in for U.S. Civil Rights, 1960\\", http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/tallahassee-florida-students-sit-us- civil-rights-1960, consulted 5/20/2015. and racism in pre-integration Tallahassee has been described as \\"virulent\\". Real estate deeds in white neighborhoods were typically accompanied by covenants prohibiting sale to blacks (see Shelley v. Kraemer). Tallahassee turned down Andrew Carnegie's offer of a grant to build a library, because under Carnegie's rules it would have to serve black patrons. (Carnegie, faced with this, instead built in 1907 the Carnegie Library on the campus of what is now Florida A&M; University. Tallahassee's former whites-only public library is today the David S. Walker Library.) Schools, buses, churches, stores, movie theaters, hospitals, parks, even cemeteries were also segregated. (Greenwood was the negro cemetery.) There was a Colored Hook and Ladder Company (fire department); the city fire department, because of \\"insufficient hoses\\", did not respond to the fire that destroyed the Lincoln Academy in 1872.Julianne Hare, Historic Frenchtown. Heart and Heritage in Tallahassee, Columbia, S.C., History Press, 2006, , p. 53. The local newspaper, the Tallahassee Democrat, had a regular black section in the paper. White subscribers received in its place the business section. =Frenchtown= After the Civil War, many newly free blacks settled in the area that came to be known as Frenchtown (because it was on part of the Lafayette Land Grant). It occupied relatively undesirable, low-lying land to the northwest of the Capitol, the downtown, and the Governor's Mansion; the latter is only two blocks from Macomb Street, Frenchtown's commercial center. Although today the southern border of Frenchtown is Tennessee Street, it previously extended to Park Avenue, including land currently occupied by the LeRoy Collins Leon County Public Library. Frenchtown is the oldest historically black neighborhood in the state. By the twentieth century Frenchtown had its own stores, doctors, pharmacy, schools, restaurants, nightclubs, and (on Tennessee Street) a movie theater. When James Baldwin visited to read some of his work at FAMU, he stayed at (and could only stay at) the Tookes Hotel.Hare, p. 91. Frenchtown was a stop on the Chitlin' Circuit, and famous black musicians like Louis Armstrong, B. B. King, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway, Little Richard, Little Milton, Al Green, Lou Rawls, and Nat and Cannonball Adderley performed there;Hare, pp. 89-90. in the 1940s Ray Charles and the Adderley brothers lived there.Bridgette Balderson, \\"Demystifying Tallahassee's Frenchtown\\", http://fsu.uloop.com/news/view.php/27449/demystifying-tallahassees-frenchtown, consulted 6/1/2015. All the businesses and night clubs on the western side of Macomb Street were torn down when it was widened around 1990. Macomb Street, together with Old Bainbridge Road, which starts where Macomb ends, was in the early twentieth century the main route out of Tallahassee to the northwest (toward Quincy, Florida, and Bainbridge, Georgia). The community was served by the Lincoln Academy, then Lincoln High School (see Old Lincoln High School), the first school to serve blacks in Leon County and one of three in the state providing secondary education to African Americans. (President Abraham Lincoln was a hero for blacks, but was hated by segregationist whites.) Its first principal was John G. Riley (see John Gilmore Riley House), who had been born a slave, and who was head of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Its final building (the fourth; two destroyed by fire) was located on Brevard Street, but facing the length of Macomb Street. It closed in 1969, when black students were admitted to previously all-white Leon High School. As often happened during desegregation, and as also happened with the Florida A&M; University College of Law and the Florida A&M; Hospital, desegregation meant that the black facility was closed and most of the black teachers, principals, and coaches lost their jobs.Rabby, pp. 256-257.

There is no connection with the current, distant Lincoln High School.

Fifty years later, the Tallahassee Democrat apologized for the segregationist perspective with which it covered the boycott.Hare, p. 79. In 1960, in imitation of the nationally famous Greensboro sit-ins at a Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, black students and sympathizers held a series of sit-ins at the lunch counter of the Tallahassee Woolworth's. At least one white student from FSU was expelled for participating.

On May 30, 1963, 220 pro-integration demonstrators, mostly FAMU students, were arrested for demonstrating in front of Tallahassee's Florida and State Theatres. Later the same day, 100 students marching in sympathy for the first group were met by city, county, and state policemen with tear gas, and 37 were arrested. Charges were later dismissed. At some of the demonstrations there were white segregationist counter-demonstrators, carrying signs saying \\"Darkies Back to Africa\\" and \\"The South Will Rise Again\\". Under pressure from Medicare, which refused to fund segregated hospitals, Tallahassee Memorial Hospital in the late 1960s started accepting black patients, and the Florida A&M; Hospital closed. As elsewhere, the hardest part of the struggle for integration in Tallahassee concerned the school system.Rabby, p. 222. Despite the unanimous Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that racially segregated schools were unconstitutional, and a court statement in 1955 that compliance with the decision should take place \\"with all deliberate speed\\" (Brown II), no schools in Florida were desegregated until 1959 (and only one school, in Miami, was integrated that year).Rabby, p. 220.Mohl, p. 348. Many Floridians viewed Brown v. Board of Education as \\"a day of catastrophe ‚Äî a Black Monday ‚Äî a day something like Pearl Harbor\\".Rabby, p. 201. Although the desegregation process in Florida brought less violence and upheaval than in other Southern states,Rabby, p. 258. Florida counties resisted integration \\"by every means\\", and local lawsuits in federal courts, on a county by county basis, were necessary for integration to take place.Rabby, p. 219.

Governor Bob Graham (1979-1987) spoke repeatedly in favor of the merging of Florida A&M; University with the formerly all-white Florida State University, which admitted its first African-American student in 1962.\\"Today marks the 50th anniversary of racial integration at Florida State University (FSU) in Tallahassee\\", Florida Memory (Division of Library and Information Services, Florida Department of State), April 20, 2012, https://www.floridamemory.com/blog/2012/04/20/fsu-commemorates-50th- anniversary-of-integration/, consulted 6/5/2015.Rabby, p. 214. Merger was discussed in the Education Committee of several legislative sessions. Loud and anguished voices from the black community led to this proposal being scrapped. The Florida Board of Regents tried another approach to achieving integration by deciding (1985) to locate a new pharmacy school at FAMU rather than FSU. As a step toward integration this also failed, as the school remained a primarily white enclave on the otherwise black campus. The Florida A&M; University ‚Äì Florida State University College of Engineering was founded as a joint venture of the two universities (and located, roughly, between them.) =After integration= Tallahassee has achieved a remarkable attitudinal change. It has gone from arguably the most racist city in the state‚Äîand Florida from 1900 to 1930 led the country in lynchings per capitaHare, p. 68.Rabby, p. 3.‚Äîto one of the most tolerant. Primarily this has been driven by the expansion of Florida State University, founded in 1947, to serve World War II veterans studying under the G.I. Bill. Its predecessor, Florida State College for Women, was politically liberal and pro-integration, but it was small and its faculty and graduates had little political power. Secondarily, Tallahassee's change has been due to Florida A&M; University, and to the changing demographics of the state itself. Florida's population growth has been due to in-migration. An African American, James R. Ford, was elected mayor in 1972 and was twice re-elected, serving until 1986. He was previously head of the Leon County School System.

Reduplication is also observable in borrowed words, such as \\"\\" (; ping-pong) and \\"\\" (; zig-zag), but since the words were borrowed as is from other languages, they are not examples of reduplication as it works in the grammar of Russian. Syllabic/root/stem reduplication There is virtually no productive syllabic or root/stem reduplication in the modern Russian language., in Proc. Intl. Congress Russian Language: Historical Fates and Modern Times (), Moscow, MSU, March 13‚Äì16, 2001, section \\"Word Formation of the Modern Russian Language\\" An ancient lexical stratum of the Russian language provides examples such as \\"\\" (; mommy), \\"\\" (; daddy), \\"\\" (; granny)--a phenomenon common to many languages. It is argued that these words originated in the reduplicated babbling of infants. Word reduplication Word reduplications are mostly the feature of the colloquial language and in most cases do not constitute separate dictionary entries. Word reduplication may occur in the following forms: *a hyphenated word, both of standard vocabulary or standard ad hoc word formation **exact reduplication: ***\\"\\" (; \\"very few\\", lit. \\"few-few\\")--a vocabulary word ***\\"\\" (; \\"very white (snow)\\", lit. \\"white-white (snow)\\")--ad hoc formation, for adjectives **inflected reduplication: ***\\"\\" (; \\"very long time ago\\", lit. \\"pastly-past\\") ***\\"\\" (; \\"very white\\", lit. \\"whitely-white\\") **Reduplication of adjectives using the enhancement preposition \\"\\" () ***\\"\\" (; \\"very big\\", lit. \\"big-very-big\\" ***\\"\\" (; \\"very white\\", lit. \\"white-very-white\\") *A repetition of a word in dialogues as a device used either to request or to promise a higher degree of cooperation:Israeli, A.

Features The player has a choice of six tile layouts \\\\- Cat, Turtle, Crab, Dragon, Fortress and Spider, each a stylized portrayal of the respective object or animal. The background image can be chosen from five different options and there are four tile sets, including traditional Mahjong tiles, variations with fuller coloring or larger print, and an alternative pastel tile set with an entirely different picture theme. Games are not entirely random. There is always at least one pair within five tiles of the topmost five tiles in the turtle layout and often two pairs. The algorithm for tile organization positions tiles such that they can mostly be paired on the same level, or otherwise a matching tile is available in an accessible position one level down. It does not check to ensure that the matching tile is not positioned beneath its partner. Since every tile has 3 partners this is not enough, by itself, to prove the game is impossible to solve. The newer version of Microsoft Mahjong has numerous further layouts, improved graphics and sound, Internet features such as a set of daily challenges that reward the user with \\"badges\\" when completed, and Xbox Live integration.

However, she is more commonly known to history as \\"Jennie\\". was a resident of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania during the Battle of Gettysburg. At the age of 20, she was the only direct civilian casualty of the battle,There were other civilians who died as an indirect result of the battle, including aged Ephraim Whistler, who succumbed to a heart attack suffered when a Confederate shell burst directly above his Chambersburg Pike home, as well as various civilians who died from handling shells that exploded and loaded weapons that discharged. when she was killed by a stray bullet on July 3, 1863. The house where she was killed is now a popular tourist attraction and museum called the \\"Jennie Wade House.\\" Early life Wade was born in Gettysburg, and worked as a seamstress with her mother in their house on Breckenridge Street while her father was in a mental asylum. She may have been engaged to Johnston Hastings \\"Jack\\" Skelly, a corporal in the 87th Pennsylvania, who had been wounded two weeks earlier in the Battle of Winchester. He died from his injuries on July 12, 1863, unaware that Wade had died days earlier.Petruzzi, pp. 220-21, 223. Skelly and Wade were childhood friends and some historians have speculated that they were engaged to be married. Only one letter between the two survived the war, and it had no romantic content. Casualty of war Early 1900s photograph of Jennie Wade's house Wade, her mother, and two younger brothers left their home in central GettysburgTanaka, p. 28. and traveled to the house of her sister, Georgia Anna Wade McClellan at 528 Baltimore Street to assist her and her newborn child. It was July 1, 1863, during the first day's fighting of the Battle of Gettysburg. More than 150 bullets hit the McClellan house during the fighting. About 8:00 a.m. on July 3, Wade was kneading dough for bread when a Mini√© ball traveled through the kitchen door and the parlor door of her sister's house and hit her. It pierced her left shoulder blade, went through her heart, and ended up in her corset. She was killed instantly. While it is uncertain which side fired the fatal shot, some authors have attributed it to an unknown Confederate sharpshooter.See, for instance, Halbur, p. 110, Trudeau, p. 451, and Wert, p. 158. Petruzzi, p. 221, attributes the death to a \\"stray bullet\\" that penetrated two doors in the home. Wade's mother heard her fall to the floor and went to tell her sister Georgia in the other room that her sister had been shot dead; two Union soldiers came from upstairs when they heard the screams of the women. They temporarily buried Wade's body in the back yard of the McClellan house, in a coffin originally intended for the Confederate General William Barksdale. In January 1864, her body was relocated to the cemetery of the German Reformed Church on Stratton Street. Her final resting place is in the Evergreen Cemetery in Gettysburg.Petruzzi, p. 221. On July 4, her mother baked 15 loaves of bread with the dough Wade had kneaded. In 1882, the United States Senate voted to grant Wade's mother a pension, citing that her daughter had been killed serving the Union cause ‚Äì baking bread for the soldiers. Monument 200px In November 1865, Wade's remains were reburied in the Evergreen Cemetery near Jack Skelly. A monument to her, designed by Gettysburg resident Anna M. Miller, was erected in 1900 that includes an American flag that flies around the clock. (The Betsy Ross House in Philadelphia is the only other site devoted to a woman to share this distinction of the perpetual flag. The Evergreen Cemetery grave of John L. Burns also flies the perpetual flag.) Notes References * Frassanito, William A. Early Photography at Gettysburg.

His principal work of Jewish law is titled \\"Dovev Meisharim\\". Dov Berish was born in Hrimlov, Galicia (now Ukraine) on 5 January 1881 (5 Shvat 5641 in the Jewish calendar) to his father Jacob 'Yekele' Weidenfeld, rabbi of the town and author of the responsa Kochav miYaakov.Biography at Yad vaShem With Reb Yekele's death shortly before Beirish's Bar Mitzvah, the delicate task of raising a new prodigy fell to his widow ‚Äì herself renowned for her genius and wit (she wrote a great number of her husband's responsa on dictation) and to her two older sons: Reb Yitzchak, who replaced his late father as Rav of Hrimlov and Reb Nachum, Rav of Dombrovo and author of the Chazon Nachum, and later celebrated as a great posek in his own right. By age 19 Reb Beirish entered by marriage into the illustrious family of Rav Yisroel Yoseif HaCharif of Tshebin. Since he did not want any rabbinic post, his wife administered a modest coal business, while he continued his single-minded pursuit of Torah study, amassing knowledge of phenomenal breadth and scope. Nonetheless, the avalanche of requests from varied kehillos that he led them as their Rav continued, and his friend, Reb Meir Arik, prayed that his business fail so that Klal Yisrael not be deprived of his leadership. For twenty years, this Tshebiner ba'al habayis (layman) ‚Äì already renowned as the \\"Gaon of Tshebin\\" ‚Äì was consulted by leading rabbanim with whom he maintained a vigorous correspondence; still he remained deaf to all rabbinical offers. However, due to his love of learning and teaching, he would commute daily to and from [Cracow] to say shiurim to the local bachurim after business hours. He carefully collected copies of these responsa, amassing enough material to publish ten volumes. In 1937 he succeeded in producing the first and only sefer ever printed in Tshebin, entitled Doveiv Meishorim ‚Äì the other nine volumes were never published. His noted son-in-law, his successor as rosh yeshiva of Kochav MiYaakov, and a noted gaon and author in his own right, Rabbi Baruch Shimon Schneersohn relates that upon republishing these responsa some 26 years after they were written, he included the Rabbie's subsequent handwritten glosses to the first edition. He found not one correction, only additional proofs to those very answers originally written without as much as a Gemara. The Tshebiner Rav's picture, along with those of the Rebbes of Ger and Belz, had appeared in the venomous tabloid Der Sturmer, his caption reading: \\"The world's greatest Talmudist.\\" Realizing that he was a target for elimination, he fled, crossing the Communist border and entering Lvov (Lemberg). Communist authorities were carrying out their systematic erasure of religious life, and the gaon of Tshebin, along with his wife, youngest daughter and thousands of other Jews, were deported to Siberia, arriving in Sverdlovsk, Siberia, in late 1940. The Tshebiner Rav arrived on Erev Pesach, 1946, in Jerusalem, which he was to call home for the rest of his life. He was soon recognized as one of the leaders of Chareidi Jewry in the Land of Israel and served as a leading member of the Council of Sages of Agudas Yisroel. He established the Kochav miYaakov Yeshiva in Jerusalem, first in the Shaarei Chesed neighborhood and later in a purpose-built building in Tel Arza. He died on the 10th of Cheshvan, 5726, 70 minutes before Shabbos. He was interred on Har HaMenuchot.

They can also take the form of simple, two-word verb/noun phrases, such as \\"climb tree\\". Although the game can recognize about 120 words, the parser only takes the first three letters into account. This means not only that the parser occasionally misidentifies words, but also that commands can be truncated: \\"lig lam\\" would be interpreted as \\"light lamp.\\" In order to complete the game, the player has to collect the thirteen lost artifacts: A statue of Paul Bunyan's blue ox, Babe, the jeweled fruit, the golden fish, a dragon's egg, a golden net, a magic carpet, a diamond necklace, a diamond bracelet, a pot of rubies, the \\"royal honey\\", a crown, a magic mirror, and a \\"firestone.\\" Development Adventureland, Adams' first program, is similar to the earlier Colossal Cave Adventure, though slightly scaled down in comparison.

The newspaper was launched in 1991 under the editorship of Naimul Islam Khan. The newspaper established the modern Bengali-language newspaper. Since 1992, Kazi Shahid Ahmed was the editor and publisher till the newspaper announced its closure in 2007.  Publication Highlights  In the 1980s, ‚ÄòSaptahik Khaborer Kagoj‚Äô, also published by Kazi Shahid Ahmed, became a popular weekly for its firm stand in favour of the masses during the Movement against the Autocrat. Soon after the fall of the autocrat, hence, the ‚ÄòAjker Kagoj‚Äô emerged as a daily to follow in the footsteps of its predecessor. Naimul Islam Khan was appointed the first editor of the daily Ajker Kagoj. After his departure, Kazi Shahid Ahmed himself edited the paper from 1992 until it finally stopped going to print. \\"You are a betrayer\\", in Bengali Tui Rajakar was one the famous comic stripe published in Ajker Kagoj. Its had raised voice again Ghulam Azam, when government tried to renew his Bangladeshi Citizenship. During that that, government stopped public advertisement fund for the newspaper. Press intimidation On 10 July 2004, an Ajker Kagoj reporter received a death threat describing him and the newspaper as an \\"enemy of Islam\\" and warning that he would be \\"killed within a month.\\" On 22 August 2004, Kamal Hossain, another reporter from the newspaper, was murdered while collecting data for a story on organized crime in the south-eastern town of Manikchhari. Ajker Kagoj was able to create a roar among the readers with the style of language used and its editorial policy. In an article published in the newspaper in 1994, educationist and writer Syed Manzoorul Islam stated that the following reasons had caused the newspaper to stand apart from its contemporaries: * The tendency to break tradition * The makeup of its reports, pages, columns * Its youth ‚Äì those who had visited its offices during its early years knew how much it had drawn on the strength of its young reporters. * Its two-page spread that was home for reports on political, social, economic, and other issues. * Its direct engagement with the notions and ideologies of the different strata in society. * Providing specific definition to newspaper columns The Tui Razakar cartoon series published in Ajker Kagoj helped to unmask the fundamentalist quarters in Bangladesh among thousands of youngsters in the early ‚Äò90s. The newspaper became predominantly vocal against repeated efforts made by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) government to reinstate Golam Azam as a citizen of the country. The newspaper had proven its commitment to not compromise as a pro‚ÄëLiberation force during the country's most trying times. Closed Ajker Kagoj was shut down on 20 September 2007 as a result of continued financial difficulties. In a statement, editor Kazi Sahed Ahmad announced all of the newspaper's 225 journalists and other staffers would receive their salary and arrears, which was maintained afterward.

It has been compared with Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray and Robert Louis Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Plot summary Danny Skinner and Brian Kibby both work for Edinburgh's restaurant-inspection team as environmental health officers. Skinner is a hard-drinking man, who is involved in football hooliganism and supports local team Hibernian F.C.. He is reading a book by Edinburgh chef Alan de Fretais called The Bedroom Secrets of the Master Chefs. He conceives a strong dislike for Kibby and bullies and undermines him mercilessly at work. He relaxes by reading Hugh MacDiarmid, Rimbaud, Verlaine and Schopenhauer, and watching Federico Fellini films. Kibby is shy and inward-looking, and drinks Horlicks, collects model trains, and obsessively plays a computer game called Harvest Moon. Kibby's social life revolves around a hillwalking group called the Hyp Hykers and attendance at Star Trek conventions. The plot describes Skinner's relationship with alcohol and his search for his unknown father. His alcoholism causes him to lose his girlfriend Kay. Gradually it dawns on him that the damage that ought to accrue to his body from his lifestyle is instead inflicted on Kibby. For a while he enjoys this, particularly relishing his promotion at work, but when Kibby becomes mortally ill he realises that he needs him. When Kibby comes out of hospital after a liver transplant (caused vicariously by Skinner's heavy drinking), they both realise that their dependency is mutual. Kibby (who has retired on health grounds) puts on weight and becomes a heavy drinker in his own right. Skinner resigns and goes to San Francisco in search of someone who might be his father. He is disappointed in this as it turns out the man was exclusively homosexual during the period in question, but does find love at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, in the shape of American Dorothy Cominsky. Skinner returns to Leith where he continues the search for his father and starts a relationship with Kibby's sister. When he discovers de Fretais having sex with Kay, he tries to kill them both, succeeding in killing the chef and gravely injuring his ex-girlfriend. By the end of the story Kibby is strongly alluded to be Skinner's half brother, with Brian's father, Keith Kibby being the man for whom Skinner had been searching. Skinner knows this with reasonable certainty, as he dies at Brian's hand. Themes The book marks a departure for Welsh in that, although ecstasy, cannabis and cocaine are mentioned in passing, there is little reference to the dance club scene of most of his other work. On the contrary, it is alcohol abuse which punctuates the novel, along with the themes of personal identity (touched upon in Marabou Stork Nightmares) and romantic love (The Undefeated, from Ecstasy). The story is told against the backdrop of the 2004 U.S. elections and the war in Iraq. Skinner's mother is a former punk fan, and although the question of her son's paternity is as good as answered by the end of the book, a possibility remains that Joe Strummer, the late Clash singer, could also have been a candidate.

Armstrong was born in Bishop-Wearmouth on 22 August 1813, the second child and eldest son of a physician who had settled in London around 1818. When he was eight years old, Armstrong was sent to a preparatory school in Hanwell under the care of a Dr Bond. He suffered much during this time from rheumatism and delicacy of health and his studies were often interrupted. In 1827, aged 14, he was sent to Charterhouse School. He went in 1832, when nearly 19 years of age, to a private tutor, the Revd James Tweed, of Harlow, Essex, with the view of fitting himself to become a candidate for Lord Crowe's Exhibition at Lincoln College, Oxford. About this time the resolution was formed to devote himself to the ministry. He took a third-class degree in classics in Michaelmas term, 1836. In 1837 he was ordained deacon and commenced his ministry as curate of Alford in Somersetshire. Armstrong was consecrated as Bishop of Grahamstown at Lambeth Parish Church on 30 November 1853 (St. Andrew's Day), but he did not reach the Diocese of Grahamstown until the following October. Armstrong, who was a man of delicate health, devoted himself to two prime objects. The first was missions to the heathen, which had been completely neglected by the Church. The bishop laid the foundations upon which the missionary work of the diocese and St John's was built. His further object was the successful founding of St. Andrew's College, Grahamstown, in 1855, whose dedication commemorates the date of his consecration. But the rough travelling and many anxieties of his diocese were too severe for the bishop's delicate frame and he died on 16 May 1856 after less than two years in the country. He is the author of the hymn text O Thou who makest souls to shine which appears in some of the editions of Hymns Ancient and Modern. His son, Edward, became a noted historian.

The series began as a handheld side story to Square's flagship franchise Final Fantasy, although most Final Fantasy-inspired elements were subsequently dropped, starting with the second installment, Secret of Mana. It has since grown to include games of various genres within the fictional world of Mana. The music of the Mana series includes soundtracks and arranged albums of music from the series, which is currently composed of Final Fantasy Adventure and its remake Sword of Mana, Secret of Mana, Trials of Mana, Legend of Mana, Dawn of Mana, Children of Mana, Friends of Mana, Heroes of Mana, Circle of Mana, and Rise of Mana. Each game except for Friends and Circle has produced a soundtrack album, while Adventure has sparked an arranged album as well as a combined soundtrack and arranged album, Legend of Mana has an additional promotional EP, and music from Secret and Trials were combined together into an arranged album. For the series' 20th anniversary, a 20-disc box set of previously-released albums was produced, as well as an album of arrangements by Kenji Ito, composer for several games in the series. The music of Final Fantasy Adventure was composed by Kenji Ito, while Hiroki Kikuta composed Secret of Mana and Trials of Mana and Yoko Shimomura wrote the score to Legend of Mana. The music of the World of Mana subseries, composed of Children, Dawn, Friends, and Heroes of Mana, was composed by many different composers, with Ito, Kikuta, Shimomura, Tsuyoshi Sekito, Masayoshi Soken, and Ryuichi Sakamoto composing Dawn, Ito, Masaharu Iwata, and Takayuki Aihara writing Children, and Shimomura composing the music of Friends and Heroes. Rise of Mana was composed by an ensemble group including Ito, Kikuta, Shimomura, Sekito, Yasuhiro Yamanaka, and Kokia. Music from the series has been performed in live concerts such as the Orchestral Game Concerts and the Symphonic Game Music Concerts, and made up one fourth of the Symphonic Fantasies concert in Cologne, Germany. Music from the Mana series has also been arranged for the piano and published as sheet music books. Final Fantasy Adventure Final Fantasy Adventure, released as Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden in Japan and Mystic Quest in Europe and marketed as a Final Fantasy spin-off, was composed by Kenji Ito; it was his second original score after that of SaGa 2 and his first solo work. The game was released in 1991 on the original Game Boy. It was remade in 2003 for the Game Boy Advance as Sword of Mana, wherein features of the original game were reworked to be brought more in line with the direction the Mana series had taken with the later games. It also severed the game from the Final Fantasy series. Ito was also the composer for the 2003 Sword of Mana, for which he remixed some pieces from Final Fantasy Adventure as well as composing new ones. Ito's music is mainly inspired by images from the game rather than outside influences; however, he never played the games themselves. Final Fantasy Adventure received a soundtrack album and an arranged album, which were later released again as a single album. Sword of Mana also sparked a soundtrack album. =Original Sound Version= Seiken Densetsu Original Sound Version is a soundtrack album of music from Final Fantasy Adventure. It was composed by Kenji Ito, with the exception of \\"Theme of Chocobo\\", which was composed by Nobuo Uematsu for the Final Fantasy series. The album covers 27 tracks and has a duration of 34:40. It was published by NTT Publishing/Square on July 15, 1991 with the catalog number N23D-003. The album was well received by critics such as Ryan Mattich of RPGFan, who termed it full of \\"quality compositions and timeless melodies\\" that created a \\"nostalgic listening experience\\". Another reviewer, in their review of the combined album, claimed that the sound hardware limitations of the Game Boy \\"forces composers to create strong melodies\\" and that the Final Fantasy Adventure soundtrack was \\"a perfect example of what quality Gameboy music should sound like\\". =Let Thoughts Ride on Knowledge= Seiken Densetsu: Let Thoughts Ride on Knowledge is a soundtrack album of music arranged from the Final Fantasy Adventure soundtrack. The original music was composed by Kenji Ito, while the versions on the album were arranged by Takayuki Hattori. The album covers 7 tracks and has a duration of 35:11. Each track covers several different songs from the original soundtrack. The pieces are arranged in an orchestral style, with moods ranging from \\"soft\\" to \\"powerful\\". It was published by NTT Publishing/Square on September 30, 1991 with the catalog number N30D-005. The album was well received by critics such as Ryan Mattich of RPGFan, who called it \\"an album of epic ambition\\" and said that it let \\"these timeless melodies live on,\\" \\"freed from the shackles of sound hardware limitations\\". Kero Hazel of Square Enix Music Online agreed, saying that \\"those 35 minutes of arranged music are worth every penny\\" in their review of the combined album. Another reviewer of the combined album called the tracks a \\"combination of great compositions and excellent arranging\\" and said that the tracks \\"flow smoothly between each other\\" creating \\"a superb thirty-five minutes of music\\". =Sound Collections= Final Fantasy Gaiden: Seiken Densetsu Sound Collections is a soundtrack album of music from Final Fantasy Adventure combining its soundtrack album and arranged album. The music was composed by Kenji Ito, while the arranged tracks, which comprise the first seven tracks of this album, were arranged by Takayuki Hattori. The album covers 34 tracks and has a duration of 69:51. It was published by NTT Publishing on August 25, 1995 with the catalog number PSCN-5029, and republished on October 1, 2004 with the catalog number NTCP-5029. The combined album was as well received as the individual albums that make it up, with RPGFan calling it \\"one fantastic CD\\" that combined the \\"superb\\" arranged tracks with the \\"expressive\\" original tracks. Kero Hazel said that the album was worth buying for either component CD alone, if one did not already have them, but that the combination together made it a \\"fantastic album\\" of \\"great music\\". =Sword of Mana= Sword of Mana Premium Soundtrack is a soundtrack album of music from Sword of Mana, the enhanced remake of Final Fantasy Adventure. It was composed by Kenji Ito, and included reworked tracks from the original game as well as new material. The second disc of the album contains piano arrangements of songs from the soundtrack, while a bonus disc included in the first edition of the album contains an orchestra arrangement of \\"Rising Sun ~ Endless Battlefield\\". The album covers 48 tracks and has a duration of 1:42:51, including the bonus disc. It was published by DigiCube on August 27, 2003 with the catalog numbers SSCX-10097~8, and republished by Square Enix on October 20, 2004 with the catalog numbers SQEX-10038~9. The album reached #118 on the Japan Oricon charts. Patrick Gann of RPGFan enjoyed it, calling it a \\"truly a gem\\". Estimating that around twenty percent of the original tracks had received \\"significant changes\\", he applauded the increase in sound quality and said that he \\"enjoy[ed] the OST tracks a great deal\\". The addition of the piano tracks and the orchestral track made the album a \\"fine soundtrack\\" and he said that acquiring the soundtrack would be a \\"very, very good idea\\". RPGamer, in their review of the game, said that the arrangements by Ito were \\"quite pleasing to the ear\\", though they noted that the quality of the music was diminished by the \\"terrible speakers\\" of the Game Boy Advance. Track list Secret of Mana and Trials of Mana Secret of Mana and Trials of Mana composer Hiroki Kikuta The scores for 1993's Secret of Mana, originally released as Seiken Densetsu 2 in Japan, and 1995's Trials of Mana, originally released as Seiken Densetsu 3 in Japan, were both composed by Hiroki Kikuta. Kikuta was originally chosen for Secret of Mana after Kenji Ito, who was originally slated for the project, was forced to drop it due to other demands on his time such as the soundtrack to Romancing SaGa. It was Kikuta's first video game score. Both games were produced for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Despite difficulties in dealing with the hardware limitations, Kikuta tried to express in the music of Secret of Mana two \\"contrasting styles\\", namely himself and the game. The purpose of this was to create an original score which would be neither pop music nor standard game music. Kikuta worked on the music for the two games mostly by himself, spending nearly 24 hours a day in his office, alternating between composing and editing to create an immersive three-dimensional sound. Rather than create MIDI versions of his compositions and rely on the sound engineers to create the sampled instruments (like most game music composers of the time), Kikuta made his own samples that matched the hardware capabilities of the Super NES so that he would know exactly how the pieces would sound on the system's hardware instead of having to deal with audio hardware differences between the original composition and the Super NES. Kikuta considers the score for Secret of Mana his favorite creation. His compositions for Secret of Mana and Trials of Mana were partly inspired by natural landscapes, as well as music from Bali. In addition to the soundtrack albums for the two games, 1995, Kikuta released an experimental album of arranged music from the two installments, titled Secret of Mana +, which features one 50-minute-long track. =Secret of Mana= Secret of Mana Original Soundtrack is a soundtrack album of music from Secret of Mana, released as Seiken Densetsu 2 Original Sound Version in Japan; the releases are identical aside from the packaging and localized English song titles. Secret of Mana was one of the first soundtrack releases in North America for the North American version of a game. The soundtrack was composed by Hiroki Kikuta. The soundtrack's music covers both \\"ominous\\" and \\"light- hearted\\" tracks, and is noted for its use of bells and \\"dark, solemn pianos\\". The title track to the game, \\"Fear of the Heavens\\", was designed by Kikuta to sync up with the title screen as it slowly faded in due to hardware limitations; at the time trying to match the audio and visual effects in a game was rare. Kikuta also started the track off with a \\"whale noise\\", rather than a traditional \\"ping\\", in order to try to \\"more deeply connect\\" the player with the game from the moment it started up; getting the sound to work with the memory limitations of the Super NES system was a difficult technical challenge. The album covers 44 tracks and has a duration of 1:06:01. It was published by NTT Publishing/Square on August 6, 1993 with the catalog number N25D-019, and reprinted by NTT Publishing on August 25, 1995 and October 1, 2004 with the catalog numbers PSCN-5030 and NTCP-5030. A remastered version of the soundtrack, also titled Secret of Mana Original Soundtrack, was released by Square Enix on February 21, 2018, to correspond with the 3D remake of the game. The remastered album contains 53 tracks across 3 discs and has a duration of over 3 hours. The album was well received by reviewers such as Eve C. of RPGFan, who called it \\"a beautifully composed CD\\" and said that it was one of the best soundtracks of any Super NES game. She said that the largest complaint with the album was the synthetic quality of the music necessitated by the Super NES's sound hardware, though she noted that the music pushed the limits of the system's hardware further than any other Super NES game. Jason Walton of RPGFan agreed, saying that \\"the music is composed extremely well, full of variety\\", though he did not like that the tracks were kept short instead of looping in order to fit all of the songs on one disc. Damian Thomas, in his review of the North American version of the album, also noted that the music was impressive for a Super NES game, and recommended the album as worth hunting for. Gamasutra, in an interview with Kikuta, described the music of Secret of Mana as leaving \\"a lasting impression on international audiences\\". IGN named the title track as the seventh best RPG title track in a 2006 feature, calling it \\"soft\\" and \\"magical\\", and saying that Kikuta \\"uses a mix of upbeat pipes and tinkering piano keys to bring the world of Mana to life\\". In a Reddit AMA, Kikuta said the track \\"Ceremony\\" is based on Indonesian gamelan music. =Trials of Mana= Seiken Densetsu 3 Original Sound Version is a soundtrack album of music from Trials of Mana. The soundtrack was composed by Hiroki Kikuta. Kikuta completed it with little assistance, having performed the sound selection, editing, effect design, and data encoding himself. The music has been described as ranging from \\"bouncy\\" and \\"energetic\\" to \\"flowing\\" and \\"serene\\". The soundtrack features 60 tracks on 3 discs and spans a duration of 3:19:21. The album was published by NTT Publishing on August 25, 1995 with the catalog numbers PSCN-5026~8 and republished by Square Enix on October 1, 2004 with the catalog numbers NTCP-5026~8. The main theme from Secret of Mana, \\"Where Angels Fear to Tread\\", called \\"Fear of the Heavens\\" there, makes a return in this installment. Freddie W. of RPGFan, in his review of the album, named it as \\"one of the high points of Hiroki Kikuta‚Äôs work on the series\\". He described it as having a very cohesive \\"feel\\", and as being a \\"more refined and matured\\" version of the \\"feeling\\" of the Secret of Mana soundtrack. Square Enix Music Online's review agreed with the quality of the music, calling it \\"among the finest ever heard on the Super Nintendo\\". They also termed it \\"in many ways superior to the score of Seiken Densetsu 2\\", which they described as having been an \\"instant winner\\" due to the work of Kikuta. Track list =Secret of Mana+= Secret of Mana+ is an arranged album of music from Secret of Mana and Trials of Mana. The music was composed and arranged by Hiroki Kikuta. The album is composed of a single track titled \\"Secret of Mana\\" that has a duration of 49:28. This track incorporates themes from the music of Secret as well as a few themes from Trials, which was still under development at the time. The style of the album is described as \\"experimental\\", using \\"strange sounds\\" such as waterfalls, bird calls, cell phone sounds, and \\"typing\\" sounds. The music has also been described as covering many different musical styles, such as \\"Debussian impressionist styles, his own heavy electronic and synth ideas, and even ideas of popular musicians\\". It was published by NTT Publishing/Square on October 29, 1993 with the catalog number N30D-021, and reprinted by NTT Publishing on August 25, 1995 and October 1, 2004 with the catalog numbers PSCN-5031 and NTCP-5031. Daniel Kalabakov, in his review for RPGFan, said that while popular opinion of the album was split between those who liked and extremely disliked the album, he personally \\"loved\\" it. He praised it for being an \\"unorthodox arrangement\\" and trying something new rather than being merely a piano or orchestral arranged album, the most common types. Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online had similar feelings about the album, praising the wide range of styles and sounds and calling it an \\"unparalleled achievement\\". Simon of Square Enix Music Online added that it was \\"refreshing to see there is no compromise\\" between Kikuta's artistic vision and more traditional commercial styles. Legend of Mana Legend of Mana and Heroes of Mana composer Yoko Shimomura Legend of Mana, released for the PlayStation in 1999, features music composed by Yoko Shimomura. She had previously composed for several Square games including Live A Live and Parasite Eve and had originally joined Square for the purpose of composing music for fantasy role- playing games. She was initially hesitant to compose for the Mana series, as she felt that it was so associated with the music of Ito and Kikuta. In 2002, Shimomura said that of all her compositions to date, she considered the soundtrack to Legend the one that best expresses herself. Shimomura claims that she prefers \\"passionate music that comes from the heart\\", and that she has to \\"feel the emotions of a piece in the extreme before I am able to write\\" the music by putting herself in the same mood as the piece is supposed to be in. Legend of Mana featured the first vocal track of any Mana game, \\"Song of Mana\\", which also serves as the game's opening theme. It was sung by Swedish vocalist Annika Ljungberg, who was chosen by Shimomura because she \\"wanted to stay away from working with someone popular that everyone already knows\\". After hearing a sample of Annika's music, she flew to Sweden \\"straight away\\" to do an analog recording of the song. Four of the game's tracks were released as part of Drammatica: The Very Best Works of Yoko Shimomura, an arranged album highlighting the composer's work: \\"Legend of MANA ~Title Theme~\\", \\"Hometown Domina\\", \\"Colored Earth\\", and \\"Bejeweled City Ruined\\". Shimomura carefully chose the songs to be included on the album based on their apparent popularity among fans and how suitable they are for orchestra. In addition to the soundtrack album, a promotional album of music from Legend of Mana was produced and was included with preorders of the game in North America. =Original Soundtrack= Seiken Densetsu / Legend of Mana Original Soundtrack is a soundtrack album of music from Legend of Mana, composed by Yoko Shimomura. The soundtrack features 55 tracks on 2 discs and spans a duration of 2:10:37. It includes \\"Song of Mana\\", sung by Swedish vocalist Annika Ljungberg. The song was later made available on the Square Vocal Collection album in 2001. The music covers many styles including piano, hard rock, and techno. The soundtrack was published by DigiCube on July 23, 1999 with the catalog number SSCX-10034, and reprinted by Square Enix on October 20, 2004 with the catalog numbers SQEX-10036~7. The album reached #65 on the Japan Oricon charts and stayed there for two weeks. Patrick Gann of RPGFan heavily praised it, saying, \\"It is simply amazing. The synth quality, the composition quality... Everything about it, quality.\\" He cited the \\"town\\" themes as Shimomura's weakest, but said that the more \\"emotional\\" pieces were much better. Gann also noted Ljungberg as an \\"amazing\\" vocalist. RPGamer's review of the album was also praising, calling the composition \\"excellent\\", the sound quality \\"superb\\", and that it kept the \\"atmosphere\\" of previous Mana game soundtracks. Track list =Music Selection= Legend of Mana Music Selection is a promotional album of music from Legend of Mana included in preorders of the game in North America. The music was composed by Yoko Shimomura. The soundtrack features five tracks and spans a duration of 18:34. It was published by Square on June 1, 2000 with the catalog number 3TP-0012K. World of Mana In 2005, Square Enix announced plans for World of Mana, a new series of titles in the Mana franchise, whose titles would span more video game genres than the original series. Koichi Ishii, the creator of the Mana series, decided even before he worked on 2002's Final Fantasy XI about creating new Mana games, but first wanted to create a goal for the new series, and eventually decided to make it about exploring how to add \\"the feeling of touch\\" to a game. After he saw the game Half-Life 2 at E3 in 2003, he felt that its physics engine was the one he needed. World of Mana went on to comprise four new games in addition to the remake of Final Fantasy Adventure; Koichi Ishii served as director or producer for all of them as he had for the previous games in the series. In 2006, a Mana installment for the Wii was considered but did not enter development. In April 2007, a month after the release of the final game of the World of Mana, Ishii left Square Enix to lead his own development company, named Grezzo; no further games in the series have been announced since. Three of the new games of World of Mana sparked soundtrack releases, with each composed by a different artist or group of artists: Children of Mana, released in 2006 for the Nintendo DS, Dawn of Mana, released in 2006 for the PlayStation 2, and Heroes of Mana, released for the Nintendo DS in 2007. The music of Dawn of Mana also formed the basis of a promotional album included with preorders of the game in Japan, while the music of Yoko Shimomura for Seiken Densetsu: Friends of Mana, a 2006 multiplayer role-playing game for Japanese mobile phones never saw any album releases. =Children of Mana= Seiken Densetsu DS: Children of Mana Original Soundtrack is a soundtrack album of music from Children of Mana, known as Seiken Densetsu DS: Children of Mana in Japan. The soundtrack was composed by Kenji Ito, Masaharu Iwata, and Takayuki Aihara, and covers a range of musical styles including rock and roll, jazz, and classical orchestra. Ito served as the lead composer. The instruments themselves, however, due to the limitations of the Nintendo DS hardware, have been described as not being \\"especially aesthetic or realistic\\". The soundtrack features 33 tracks on 2 discs and spans a duration of 1:24:13. It was published by Square Enix on May 9, 2006 on the Japanese iTunes Store, but has not been released as a physical album. Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online, in his review of the album, reacted positively to the score, calling it a \\"colourful, diverse, and rich experience overall\\". He called the tracks by Iwata and Aikara the \\"core\\" of the album, saying that the tracks by Ito felt \\"banal\\" and \\"formulaic\\" which he attributed to Ito being too overworked to focus on the album. RPGamer, in their review of the game, called the music \\"pretty nice\\". They noted that the music did not stand out as much as the visuals of the game, though they still \\"conveyed the theme\\", and that the \\"town\\" tracks were in their opinion weaker than the rest of the soundtrack. Track list =Dawn of Mana= Seiken Densetsu 4 Original Soundtrack -Sanctuary- is a soundtrack album of music from Dawn of Mana, known as Seiken Densetsu 4 in Japan. The soundtrack was composed by Kenji Ito, Tsuyoshi Sekito, Masayoshi Soken, Hiroki Kikuta, Yoko Shimomura, and Ryuichi Sakamoto, with many of the tracks composed by one artist arranged by another. The styles portrayed on the soundtrack cover \\"soft, heartwarming tunes\\", fast-paced \\"rock and roll style\\" tracks, and \\"dark and dramatic tunes\\", while the arranged songs that appear on the fourth disc of the soundtrack album are split between orchestral and rock and roll styles. The theme song to the game, \\"Dawn of Mana\\", was composed by Grammy-winning composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, and was inspired by the image of the Mana tree shown at the title screen. The composition of the soundtrack was done under a great deal of time pressure; Soken has said that he composed 32 tracks in 52 days at a breakneck pace, and Sekito has said that Ito conducted the orchestral recordings while ill to make the deadline. The soundtrack features 106 tracks on 4 discs and spans a duration of 4:19:41. It was published by Square Enix on January 24, 2007 with the catalog numbers SQEX-10083~6. Dennis Rubinshteyn of RPGFan was pleased by the soundtrack, saying that the music met his high expectations for what he called the \\"only redeeming quality left\\" to the series since Legend of Mana. Summing the album up as a \\"solid soundtrack with great songs and a lot of variety\\", he named Sekito's tracks as the least appealing on the soundtrack, causing some parts of the album as a whole to be \\"hit or miss\\". Bryan Matheny of Square Enix Music Online held the opposite opinion, calling Sekito's pieces what \\"made this work bearable\\" and saying that he \\"just can't get into this soundtrack\\", especially the first three discs, which were full of \\"boring and underdeveloped\\" tracks. Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online's review, however, was more in line with RPGFan's, wherein he praised the \\"diversity\\" and \\"glorious spectrum of emotion\\" found in the soundtrack. He cited the synthesizer operation as a weak point as well as the order of the tracks, and singled out Sekito's tracks as \\"forgettable\\" and \\"repetitive\\". Track list =Breath of Mana= Breath of Mana is a promotional album of music from Dawn of Mana included with preorders of the game in Japan. Despite the many composers of the full soundtrack, the five songs on Breath were all composed and arranged by Kenji Ito. Three of the songs, \\"Breath of MANA\\", \\"Unforgotten Memories\\", and \\"Rising Sun (piano solo ver.)\\", did not appear on the full soundtrack album. The songs on the disc are \\"gentle melodies\\" using orchestra and piano. The five songs cover a duration of 13:41. The disc was published by Square Enix on December 21, 2006. A review of the album by Dennis Rubinshteyn of RPGFan called it a \\"good showcase\\" of the strengths of the full album, which were in his opinion the tracks by Ito. He felt that the tracks on the single were \\"superb\\", and said that it was a shame that two of the tracks were not found on the soundtrack album. =Heroes of Mana= Seiken Densetsu: Heroes of Mana Original Soundtrack is a soundtrack album of music from Heroes of Mana, known as Seiken Densetsu: Heroes of Mana in Japan. The soundtrack was composed by Yoko Shimomura. The musical style of the tracks is primarily orchestral, with the addition of a strong piano and drums that sometimes verge on a more tribal rhythm. The soundtrack features 49 tracks on 2 discs and spans a duration of 2:24:28. Three of the game's tracks were released as part of Drammatica: The Very Best Works of Yoko Shimomura, an arranged album highlighting the composer's work: \\"To the Heroes of Old ~Opening Theme from Heroes of Mana~\\", \\"The Way the Heart Is\\" (as \\"Tango Appassionata\\"), and \\"The Tale Told by the Wind ~Ending Theme from Heroes of Mana~\\". Shimomura carefully chose the songs to be included on the album based on their apparent popularity among fans and how suitable they are for orchestra. The Heroes of Mana soundtrack was published by Square Enix on April 18, 2007 with the catalog numbers SQEX-10095~6. Denis Rubinshteyn, in his review of the album, said that while the game itself was poor, \\"the music is a treat\\". Calling the music \\"solid\\" and \\"enjoyable\\", he highlighted Shimomura's use of drums and variations on themes as particularly worthy of praise. Don Kotowski of Square Enix Music Online agreed, saying that Square Enix \\"made the right decision\\" in asking Shimomura to compose the soundtrack, as she was able to \\"capture the spirit of the Mana series extremely well\\". He singled out the \\"battle tracks and event themes\\" as the weakest tracks and \\"'The Tale Told by the Wind' and the final battle\\" as some of the best. Track list 20th Anniversary For the 20th anniversary of the Mana series in 2011, Square Enix released a number of albums. These included several arranged albums, as well as a box set of every soundtrack album from the series plus Let Thoughts Ride on Knowledge and Secret of Mana+. The twenty-disc set, entitled Seiken Densetsu Music Complete Book, was released on September 14, 2011. It includes music composed by Kenji Ito, Nobuo Uematsu, Hiroki Kikuta, Yoko Shimomura, Masaharu Iwata, Takayuki Aihara, Tsuyoshi Sekito, Masayoshi Soken, and Ryuichi Sakamoto. The album has a total length of 19:35:19. =Re:Birth= As a part of the anniversary celebration, Square Enix released an album of arrangements of music from the series, Re:Birth/Seiken Densetsu Kenji Ito Arrange Album. The album features ten arrangements by Kenji Ito of music he composed for Final Fantasy Adventure, Sword of Mana, Children of Mana, and Dawn of Mana. Six tracks are from the original game, two from Dawn, and one each from the other two games. The album was published by Square Enix on October 19, 2011, with a duration of 45:06. The arrangements cover a wide variety of genres, from vocal and chamber music to techno and dubstep. The album was originally planned to be followed soon after by two more similar albums, one each from Hiroki Kikuta and Yoko Shimamura, but those albums were never released. Patrick Gann of RPGFan felt that the album's tracks were \\"hit-or-miss\\", containing some stellar arrangements mixed in with lackluster ones. He recommended it to any collector of Mana music. Jayson Napolitano of Original Sound Version was more complimentary towards the album, enjoying many of the tracks that Gann did not, though he too was not as impressed by the Dawn of Mana arrangements. Rise of Mana In 2014, Square Enix released Rise of Mana, a free-to-play action role-playing game for iOS and Android. The music of Rise of Mana was composed by a group of different composers: the majority of the music was handled by Tsuyoshi Sekito. In addition to Sekito, the soundtrack was also contributed to by three previous Mana composers: Kenji Ito (Final Fantasy Adventure, Children of Mana, Dawn of Mana), Hiroki Kikuta (Secret of Mana, Trials of Mana) and Yoko Shimomura (Legend of Mana, Heroes of Mana). Also joining the team was sound engineer Yasuhiro Yamanaka. In all, 21 out of the 28 composed pieces were done by Sekito. Ito, Kikuta, Shimomura and Yamanaka each contributed one track. The soundtrack featured an arrangement for piano of \\"Rising Sun\\", the series' main theme. Yamanaka acted as sound director, while poro@lier created the piano arrangements for both \\"Rising Sun\\" and the game's theme song. The game's theme song, \\"Believe in the Spirit\\", was composed, written and sung by Japanese singer-songwriter Kokia. Prior to coming on board, she had little knowledge of the Mana series. As with her previous compositions for video games, Kokia tried to get a feel for the game's atmosphere before starting, either through playing the game directly or looking at behind-the-scenes material related to the game's world. With \\"Believe in the Spirit\\", she worked to create a song that would appeal to both players and the production team. The track was performed using strings, a tin whistle, an acoustic guitar and percussion. The arrangement was done by Mina Kubota. Seiken Densetsu: Rise of Mana Original Soundtrack was released on April 23, 2014 through Square Enix's music label. Andrew Barker of RPGFan was cautiously positive about the album: he described \\"Believe in the Spirit\\" as being \\"hit-or-miss\\" for different listeners while evoking memories of earlier Mana games. The rest of the soundtrack was generally praised: the first half's restful melodies were the stand-out tracks and said to be the strongest, while the later upbeat tracks were praised for their various energizing qualities. Some tracks, such as \\"The Drip Drip Drip of Memory\\", being fairly weak and forgettable. Barker generally compared the music to that of Final Fantasy XII, recommending it for fans of the latter and finishing that the album was generally good despite some unmemorable pieces. Chris Greening of Video Game Music Online gave the album a 2.5-star rating: he was most positive about the tracks from the guest composers like Ito and Shimomura. While he praised Sekito for moving away from his traditional musical style, he felt that the result was fairly mixed, with some tracks lacking the proper emotional drive and others \\"falling flat\\". \\"Believe in the Spirit\\" was praised for avoiding J-pop elements and sticking with its Celtic style, being favorably compared to the theme songs of Xenogears. Overall, Green felt that, while it had good production value and was substantially better than other mobile game soundtracks, but lacked the emotional impact of previous Mana titles in the majority of its tracks. Many reviewers of the game also praised the soundtrack. Legacy The track \\"Fear of the Heavens\\" from Secret of Mana was performed by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra for the third Orchestral Game Concert in 1993, while \\"Meridian Child\\" from Trials of Mana was performed for the fifth Orchestral Game Concert in 1996. \\"Fear of the Heavens\\" was also performed at the fifth Symphonic Game Music Concert in 2007 in Leipzig, Germany. Legend of Manas title theme was also performed by the Australian Eminence Symphony Orchestra for its classical gaming music concert A Night in Fantasia 2007. Kenji Ito, along with other players, performed \\"Fool's Dance\\" from Dawn of Mana at the Extra: Hyper Game Music Event 2007 concert in Tokyo on July 7, 2007. Sinfonia Drammatica, an August 4, 2009 concert performed by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra in Stockholm, Sweden, featured several Mana songs as part of a combination of Yoko Shimomura's album Drammatica and the previous Stockholm Symphonic Shades concert. These tracks, all from Drammatica, were \\"Colored Earth\\", \\"Sparkling City\\", \\"Title Theme\\", and \\"Hometown Domina\\" from Legends of Mana; none of the Heroes of Mana tracks on the album were played at the concert. Music from the series made up one- fourth of the music in the Symphonic Fantasies concerts in Cologne and Oberhausen in September 2009 which were produced by the creators of the Symphonic Game Music Concert series and conducted by Arnie Roth. The concerts featured a suite comprising Secret of Mana songs \\"Fear of the Heavens\\", \\"Flight into the Unknown\\", \\"Eternal Recurrence\\", \\"Premonition\\", \\"The Sorcerer\\", and \\"Rose and Spirit\\", as well as a boss battle encore suite which included \\"Meridian Festival\\". On February 6, 2011 the Eminence Symphony Orchestra played a concert in Tokyo as part of the Game Music Laboratory concert series as a tribute to the music of Kenji Ito and Hiroki Kikuta. The concert included \\"Bodorui\\", \\"Mana Temple\\", and \\"Rising Sun\\" from Final Fantasy Adventure; \\"Kind Memories\\", \\"Crisis\\", and \\"Meridian Dance\\" from Secret of Mana; and \\"Meridian Child\\" from Trials of Mana. The Final Fantasy Adventure pieces were played on the piano by Ito. A concert composed of music from the Re:Birth album and the Re:Birth II SaGa series album was performed in Tokyo on May 9, 2015 and in Osaka on May 10. The concert was produced by Ito, and featured him on piano. Music from the original soundtracks of the Mana games has been arranged for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing. Books are available for the soundtracks to Dawn of Mana, Legend of Mana, and Sword of Mana. Two companion books have also been published as Seiken Densetsu Best Collection Piano Solo Sheet Music first and second editions, with the first edition covering tracks from Final Fantasy Adventure, Secret of Mana, and Trials of Mana, while the second adds tracks from Legend of Mana and Dawn of Mana. All songs in each book have been rewritten by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos, though they are meant to sound as much like the originals as possible. Additionally, KMP Music Publishing has published a book of the piano album included in the Sword of Mana soundtrack album, which was arranged by Kenji Ito.

He was the son of King Huiwen and younger brother of King Wu. King Zhaoxiang reigned as the King of Qin for 57 years, and was responsible for the state of Qin achieving strategic dominance over the other six major states. During his reign, Qin captured the Chu capital Ying in 278 BC, conquered the Xirong state of Yiqu in 272 BC, slaughtered a 450,000-strong Zhao army at Changping in 260 BC, and overthrew the Eastern Zhou dynasty in 256 BC. These aggressive territorial expansions and the strategic weakening of other rival states paved the path for Qin's eventual unification of China three decades later by his great-grandson Ying Zheng.  Biography  = Ascension = Prince Ying Ji was born in 325 BC to one of King Huiwen's more lower-ranked concubines, Lady Mi (ÁæãÂÖ´Â≠ê). As a shu child, Prince Ji was given low priority in the royal line of succession, and as an underage child was not granted a fief because the state of Qin employed a system of meritocracy that demanded that even princes earn their own lands through national service. He was dispatched to the state of Yan at a young age to serve as a political hostage, a common diplomatic practice among vassal states throughout Zhou Dynasty. In 307 BC, Ying Ji's older half-brother, King Wu, unexpectedly died after breaking his shin bones while trying to show off his physical prowess by lifting a heavy bronze cauldron in the Zhou palace at Wangcheng. King Wu died young and childless, hence placing the state of Qin into a succession crisis, with a number of princes now eligible to claim the throne. At the time, Prince Ji was still a hostage in the state of Yan, and was generally considered unlikely to be a candidate. However, King Wuling of Zhao decided to take advantage of the situation and intervene in the domestic politics of his western neighbour. King Wuling ordered his chancellor of the Dai Commandery, Zhao Gu (Ë∂ôÂõ∫), to smuggle Prince Ji out of Yan into Zhao territory, before endorsing him to return to Qin and contest for the throne. Furthermore, Prince Ji's maternal uncle, Wei Ran (È≠èÂÜâ), was a general in command of a significant Qin military forces, and helped suppressing most of his nephew's political opponents. This enabled Prince Ji to successfully claim the throne as the King Zhaoxiang of Qin at the age of 18. Because King Zhaoxiang had not yet legally come of age (traditionally at the age of 20), his mother, who was now known as Queen Dowager Xuan, became the regent. She was supported by her brothers, Wei Ran and Mi Rong (ÁæãÊàé), as well as two other sons, Prince Yi (ÂÖ¨Â≠êÊÇù) and Prince Fu (ÂÖ¨Â≠êÂ∑ø), the four of them collectively known as the \\"Four Nobles\\" (ÂõõË≤¥). = Reign = In his first year as ruler (306 BC), King Zhaoxiang accepted the counsel of the Right Chancellor, Gan Mao (ÁîòËåÇ), who advocated the return of the Wusui (Ê≠¶ÈÅÇ) region back to the state of Han. The plan was opposed by two other officials Xiang Shou (ÂêëÂ£Ω) and Gongsun Shi (ÂÖ¨Â≠´Â•≠), who both despised Gan Mao greatly and proceeded to badmouth him repeatedly. This led Gan Mao to flee Qin in fear of his life and defect to the state of Qi. In 305 BC, two of King Zhaoxiang's older half-brothers, Prince Zhuang (ÂÖ¨Â≠êÂ£Ø) and Prince Yong (ÂÖ¨Â≠êÈõç), who a year ago were both rival contenders for the throne, conspired to carry out a coup with Queen Huiwen (ÊÉ†ÊñáÂêé, the mother of the late King Wu) and Queen Wu (ÊÇºÊ≠¶ÁéãÂêé, King Wu's childless wife, who was a princess from Wei) as well as a dozen other lords and court officials who were against King Zhaoxiang's ascension. The rebellion was quickly crushed by Wei Ran, who slaughtered all the conspirators except Queen Wu, who was exiled back to Wei. With the annihilation of the dissidents, King Zhaoxiang's hold to the throne was secured. In the same year, King Zhaoxiang had his coming-of-age ceremony, and began to personally attend state affairs.  War against Chu  In 304 BC, King Zhaoxiang met with King Huai of Chu in Huangqi (ÈªÉÊ£ò) to negotiate an alliance, ceding Shangyong (‰∏äÂ∫∏) as a gesture. In 303 BC, the states of Qi, Wei and Han broke off their previous alliance with Chu and invaded Chu, forcing Chu to send its crown prince Xiong Heng to Qin as a hostage in exchange for Qin assistance. King Zhaoxiang sent troops to attack Wei and Han, capturing Puban (Ëí≤Èò™), Yangchun (ÈôΩÊò•) and Fengling (Â∞ÅÈôµ) from Wei, and re-capturing Wusui from Han. In 302 BC, King Zhaoxiang met with King Xiang of Wei and Crown Prince Yin of Han (ÈüìÂ§™Â≠êÂ¨∞) in Linjin (Ëá®Êôâ), and agreed to return the seized lands in exchange for the two states denouncing their previous anti-Qin alliance. At the same time, the Chu crown prince secretly fled from Qin back to Chu. In 301 BC, the four states of Qin, Han, Wei and Qi allied together to attack Chu, defeating the Chu army at Zhongqiu (Èáç‰∏ò) and killing the Chu general Tang Mei (ÂîêÁúú). In 300 BC, King Zhaoxiang sent his uncle Mi Rong to capture Xiangcheng (Ë•ÑÂüé), killing 30,000 enemy and the Chu general Jing Que (ÊôØÁº∫) in the process. Due to this defeat, in 299 BC King Huai of Chu was forced to go to Wu Pass (Ê≠¶Èóú) to negotiate terms with Qin, but along the way was abducted and taken to Xianyang instead. When he refused to cede the territory of the Wu Commandery (Â∑´ÈÉ°) and Qianzhong Commandery (Èªî‰∏≠ÈÉ°), he was detained as a hostage. King Zhaoxiang then proceeded to invade Chu the next year, capturing 16 cities and killing 50,000 Chu soldiers. King Huai of Chu did manage to escape in 297 BC, when Qin was distracted by a joint siege on Hangu Pass by Wei and Han, but he was recaptured when he was seeking asylum in Wei, after unsuccessfully doing so in the state of Zhao. He died a year later in captivity, and Qin finally returned his corpse back to Chu. The next Chu king, King Qingxiang, was an even less competent ruler than his father. In 280 BC, Qin forces defeated the Chu army again, forcing them to cede Shangyong and Hanbei (Êº¢Âåó) to Qin control. In 279 BC, Qin generals Bai Qi (ÁôΩËµ∑) and Zhang Ruo (ÂºµËã•) launched amphibious assaults on Chu from two different fronts, capturing the cities of Deng (ÈÑß), Yan (ÈÑ¢, Chu's secondary capital at the time) and Xiling (Ë•øÈôµ), during which Bai Qi flooded the city of Yan with a redirected river, drowning hundreds of thousands of people. This successful Qin campaign paved the way for Bai Qi's subsequent siege and capture of the Chu capital city of Ying (ÈÉ¢) in 278 BC, where Bai Qi burned the Chu ancestral mausoleums Yiling. The greatly weakened state of Chu was forced to relocate its capital to Chen (Èô≥). Qin then permanently annexed the vast lands around Dongting Lake, south of the Yangtze River and north up towards Anlu (ÂÆâÈô∏), where the new Nan Commandery (ÂçóÈÉ°) was established.  War against Han and Wei  In 301 BC, Qin again attacked Han, led by King Zhaoxiang's uncle, Wei Ran, and occupied the city of Rang (Á©∞Âüé). The city was later given to Wei Ran, who was made chancellor six years later, as his fief. However, in 298 BC, Qin suffered a setback at Hangu Pass under the combined attack from a three-state alliance of Qi, Han and Wei, and was forced to concede the recently occupied Fengling and Wusui back to Wei and Han. In 293 BC, the states of Han, Wei and East Zhou allied together to attack Qin. King Zhaoxiang appointed the young Bai Qi as general, and defeated the two major states at Yique, killing 240,000 of the enemy and capturing (then executing) the enemy's supreme commander Gongsun Xi (ÂÖ¨Â≠´Âñú). This was the most devastating blow Qin delivered to the two eastern states to date. In 292 BCÔºåBai Qi again led the army and attacked Wei, capturing Weicheng (È≠èÂüé) and sacking Yuanqu (Âû£ÈÇë). Then in 291 BC, Qin attacked Han again and seized the city of Wan (ÂÆõÂüé) and Ye (Ëëâ). In 290 BCÔºåKing Zhaoxiang sent Sima Cuo (Âè∏È¶¨ÈåØ), who captured Zhi (Ëªπ) from Wei and Deng (ÈÑß) from Han, before joining with Bai Qi to seize Yuanqu again. These successive victories forced Wei to concede 400 li of Hedong lands, and Han to concede 200 li of Wusui lands to Qin. In 289 BC, King Zhaoxiang sent Bai Qi and Sima Cuo to attack Wei, capturing 61 villages around Zhi. However, in 288 BC, Qin was forced to back down when the five eastern states allied together and threatened to attack Qin again. It did not take long for Qin to strike back, capturing Xinyuan (Êñ∞Âû£) and Quyang (Êõ≤ÈôΩ) from Wei in 287 BC, and the former Wei capital Anyi (ÂÆâÈÇë) in 286 BC. In 283 BC, Qin allied with Zhao and attacked Wei again, capturing Ancheng (ÂÆâÂüé) with its vanguard reaching near the Wei capital Daliang (Â§ßÊ¢Å). In 276 BC, King Zhaoxiang once again sent Bai Qi to attack Wei. The following year in 275 BC, he sent his uncle Wei Ran to attack Daliang and killed 40,000 Han reinforcements sent to relieve the siege, forcing Wei to concede eight forts from Wencheng (Ê∫´Âüé). Wei Ran attacked Wei again in 274 BC, capturing four cities and killing 40,000 men. In 273 BC, Wei and Zhao allied together to attack the Han city of Huayang (ËèØÈôΩ). King Zhaoxiang sent troops to relieve the siege, killing 130,000 Wei soldiers outside Huayang and drowning 20,000 Zhao prisoners, forcing Wei to seek an armistice as well as ceding Nanyang (ÂçóÈôΩ). Qin attacked Wei again in 268 BC and captured Huaicheng (Êá∑Âüé). In 266 BC, the Wei national Fan Ju (ËåÉÈõé) fled to Qin after being persecuted and tortured by the Wei chancellor, Wei Qi (È≠èÈΩä), and vowed revenge upon his home state. He advised King Zhaoxiang about the strategy of \\"allying distant states while attacking nearby states\\" (ÈÅ†‰∫§ËøëÊîª). This advice impressed King Zhaoxiang so much that he appointed him as the chancellor of Qin. In 264 BC, King Zhaoxiang sent Bai Qi to attack Han, capturing nine cities including Xingcheng (ÈôòÂüé) and killing 50,000 of the enemy, enabling Qin to blockade the routes around southern Taihang Mountains. In 262 BC, Bai Qi attacked Han and captured Yewang (ÈáéÁéã), cutting off the Shangdang region from the Han mainland. King Huanhui of Han was fearful of the Qin military prowess and decided to concede Shangdang, but the local commanders refused to do so and instead surrendered the region to the state of Zhao. The struggle for control of Shangdang triggered direct conflicts between Qin and Zhao, then the two largest military powers among the warring states, leading to the devastating Battle of Changping. In 256 BC, a Qin general named Jiu (Êëé) attacked Han, killing 40,000 of the enemy and capturing Yangcheng (ÈôΩÂüé) and Fushu (Ë≤†Èªç). Two years later in 254 BC, Jiu attacked Wei and captured Wucheng (Âê≥Âüé), forcing Wei to submit to Qin as a vassal state.  Conquest of Yiqu  Yiqu (Áæ©Ê∏†), also known as \\"the Rong of Yiqu\\" (Áæ©Ê∏†‰πãÊàé), was a semi-pastoral, semi-agricultural people residing in the region from north of Jing River to western Hetao. They were historically an offshoot of the nomadic Qiang people living on the grasslands around Long Mountains during the Shang Dynasty, and were frequently at war with the surrounding nomadic tribes like Guifang (È¨ºÊñπ) and Xunyu (ÁçØÈ¨ª), as well as the agricultural Huaxia settlements like Bin (Ë±≥, the precursor to Zhou). During the times of King Geng Ding in late Shang Dynasty (around 12th century BC), faced with a large Northern Di invasion, the aged Duke of Bin Gugong Danfu led his clan south and relocated to Qishan, and the Bin exodus resulted in the area being occupied by Di nomads hostile and stronger than Yiqu, who temporarily submitting to Xianyun (Áç´ÁãÅ). During the reign of Wu Yi of Shang, Duke Jili of the now renamed state of Zhou attacked and evicted the Di presence from lands north of Bin with the support from the Shang court, and made Yiqu subject to Zhou instead. During the reign of Duke Wen of Zhou, Chancellor Jiang Ziya sent ambassador Nangong Kuo to negotiate an alliance with Yiqu, who assisted Zhou in evicting their rival Guifang, while occupied the fertile Longdong region for themselves. This allowed the Yiqu population to prosper, and after learning agricultural techniques and city building from the Zhou people, became significantly influenced by Zhou culture. Yiqu hence transformed into a distinctly different branch from other Xirong tribes, though still retaining the tradition of levirate marriage. After the establishment of the Zhou Dynasty, Yiqu initially swore loyalty and participated in multiple Zhou campaigns against Di and other Rong tribes. In 771 BC, Marquess of Shen conspired with Quanrong (Áä¨Êàé) to sack the Zhou capital city Haojing, killing King You of Zhou and his crown prince Bofu, and the Western Zhou Dynasty collapsed. Yiqu took advantage of the chaos, rebelled and annexed the surrounding four smaller Xirong tribes, and established their own multi-city state centred around modern day Ning County, Gansu, spanning an area of nearly from Guyuan grasslands to the west, Qiaoshan to the east, Hetao to the north and Jing River to the south. With the old capital city in ruins, the new Zhou king, King Ping, hastily relocated the capital to Luoyi (ÈõíÈÇë), starting the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. When King Ping moved east, a minor vassal lord from the land of Qinyi (Áß¶ÈÇë), Duke Xiang, provided military escort. To reward Duke Xiang's contribution, King Ping formally granted him a nobility rank and enfeoffed him as a feudal lord, elevating the clan of Qin from a lowly \\"attached state\\" (ÈôÑÂ∫∏) to a major vassal state. Fearing another barbarian attack from the west and desperately in need of a buffer state, King Ping further promised Duke Xiang that any lands the Qin clan could seize from the Rong tribes west of Qishan (the former heartland of Zhou), they could keep permanently as their own fief. As a marcher clan already with a bitter history with the Xirong tribes, the new noble state of Qin were greatly motivated by this royal promise, and successive generation of Qin rulers died in battle against their Xirong enemy, three of the largest being Mianzhu (Á∂øË´∏, near modern-day Tianshui), Dali (Â§ßËçî, near modern-day Dali County), and Yiqu. Around 650 BC, Yiqu had conquered most of its surrounding smaller tribes and began to expand eastwards, bringing it into direct conflict with the state of Qin. In 651 BC, one of the other larger Xirong tribes, Mianzhu, recruited a Jin man in exile named You Yu (Áî±‰Ωô) as the ambassador to Qin in order to improve the strained diplomatic relationship. However, You Yu secretly defected and gave counsel to Duke Mu of Qin regarding ways to defeat the Xirong. Using You Yu's advice, Duke Mu sent women and musicians to the king Mianzhu, distracting him from domestic affairs. In 623 BC, Duke Wu led a well-prepared Qin army, invaded and conquered Mianzhu along with over 20 smaller Rong and Di states. Yiqu was among those defeated and forced to claim fealty to Qin's military prowess. For his dominance in the western region, Duke Mu received a golden drum from King Xiang of Zhou as commendation, and was later regarded as one of the Five Hegemons. However, after Duke Mu died, the subsequent Qin rulers were not as competent as their forebear. Being the most sinicized of all Xirong tribes, Yiqu spent the next two centuries slowly building up its strength. In 430 BC, Yiqu invaded Qin territory, forcing Duke Zao of Qin to abandon lands north of lower Wei River. The following three decades were the pinnacle of Yiqu power, with its territory doubling to almost . At this point, Yiqu had become a major threat to Qin, who had to solely focus on dealing with this north-western neighbour and thus became marginalised by other major Central Plain vassals states to the east. In 361 BC, Duke Xiao of Qin ascended as the ruler of Qin, and appointed Wei Yang in 359 BC, who enacted a series of legalist reforms that greatly strengthened the state of Qin. In 332 BC, King Huiwen of Qin dispatched Gongsun Yan (ÂÖ¨Â≠´Ë°ç) to attack Wei, killing 80,000 enemies and capturing Xihe Commandery (Ë•øÊ≤≥ÈÉ°) and Shang Commandery (‰∏äÈÉ°). At the time, Yiqu was having domestic disputes, so the Qin army, with its morale boosted by the recent victories, invaded Yiqu under the pretext of helping to quell Yiqu's chaos. They were able to subject Yiqu to Qin rule. In 327 BC, Qin attacked and seized the city of Yuzhi (ÈÉÅÈÉÖ), forcing Yiqu to again swear fealty, this time formally as a Qin county. However, nine years later, in 318 BC, the five eastern states of Wei, Han, Zhao, Yan and Chu allied together and attacked Hangu Pass, forcing the Qin main force to leave its heartland. Yiqu took the opportunity and rebelled, and attacked Qin from the rear as part of a collaboration with the five-state alliance, defeating an undermanned Qin garrison at Libo (ÊùéÂ∏õ). However, the allied five states were soon routed by a Qin counter-offensive led by Chulizi (Ê®óÈáåÂ≠ê, King Huiwen's brother), suffering a loss of 82,000 men. The victorious Qin army then returned and retaliated against Yiqu in 314 BC by invading from three different directions, capturing 25 cities and greatly weakening Yiqu. In 306 BC, the young King Zhaoxiang ascended to the throne, with his mother Queen Dowager Xuan serving as regent. Knowing Qin could not focus on eradicating Yiqu when it had the hostile eastern states to deal with, and her son's rule was still shaky due to numerous rival princes keen to capture the throne, Queen Dowager Xuan decided to use an approach of pretended conciliation. She invited the king of Yiqu to live long-term in the Ganquan Palace, and consummated a seductive liaison that produced two sons with him. This completely removed the Yiqu King's hostility towards Qin, as the beguiled king had lost all cautiousness around the Queen Dowager. At the same time, King Zhaoxiang was aggressively acting to weaken rival warring states in the east and south, and Queen Dowager Xuan was secretly planning with her son the eventual annihilation of Yiqu. Finally in 272 BC, Queen Dowager Xuan bared her fangs. She lured the unsuspecting Yiqu King to Ganquan Palace again, and had him assassinated on the spot. Shortly after, the Qin army invaded and overran the leaderless Yiqu, permanently annexing its entire territory into the newly established commanderies of Longxi and Beidi (ÂåóÂú∞).Nicola Di Cosmo, The Northern Frontier in Pre-Imperial China//The Cambridge History of Ancient China, p. 961 The Xirong threat that had plagued the state of Qin for over five centuries was removed for good.  War against Qi  The state of Qin actually did not share any borders with the state of Qi, but they nevertheless clashed with each other due to the complicated zong-heng diplomacy during the Warring States period. In 299 BC, King Zhaoxiang invited Lord Mengchang to Qin with the intention of appointing him as chancellor. However, after hearing (perhaps ill-intended) warnings from his ministers that Lord Mengchang was still loyal to his home state of Qi (which had just soured its diplomatic relationship with Qin), King Zhaoxiang ordered Lord Mengchang to be put under house arrest. Desperate, Lord Mengchang sent a messenger to bribe King's Zhaoxiang's favourite concubine, who demanded a snow fox fur coat, which Lord Mengchang had already given to King Zhaoxiang as a gift when he first arrived and had to steal back from the royal vault. Thanks to the pleas of the concubine, Lord Mengchang was released within two days, and he quickly smuggled himself out of Qin, narrowly evading a small army that King Zhaoxiang had ordered to pursue him. In 298 BC, the disgruntled Lord Mengchang, who was now the newly appointed chancellor of Qi, lobbied for a combined force of Qi, Han and Wei and laid siege to the Qin fortification of Hangu Pass. The allied army managed to penetrate past the Hangu Pass all the way to Yanshi (ÁõêÊ∞è), forcing Qin to negotiate an armistice that involved returning the previously occupied Fengling and Wusui back to Wei and Han. In 288 BC, King Zhaoxiang contacted King Min of Qi and proposed an alliance where both would claim the title \\"Di\\", and planned to attack the newly strengthened state of Zhao together. However, King Min was persuaded by Su Qin to renounce his Di title, and instead allied with other states to attack Qin, forcing King Zhaoxiang to also renounce his Di title. At the same time, Qi took the opportunity to conquer its rival state of Song, which made itself a major immediate threat in the eyes of other states. In 284 BC, King Zhaoxiang sent troops in a five-state alliance of Qin, Yan, Zhao, Wei and Han, led by the Yan general Yue Yi, to attack Qi. Over 70 cities were captured within six months, including its capital Linzi (Ëá®Ê∑Ñ), leading to the murder of King Min of Qi by his supposed Chu ally. The two remaining Qi cities Ju and Jimo were then sieged by the allied forces for five years. Qi eventually defeated the allied forces and recaptured lost lands after a routing victory at Jimo by Tian Dan using flaming oxens. However, Qi never regained its former strength and influence, and could no longer create any geopolitical threat to Qin.  War against Zhao  In 283 BC, King Zhaoxiang offered to trade fifteen cities in exchange for the Heshibi jade, which was in the state of Zhao's possession. King Huiwen of Zhao was attracted by the offer and agreed to the trade. However, the Zhao ambassador Lin Xiangru (Ëó∫Áõ∏Â¶Ç) figured out that Qin never meant to hold up their end of the deal, and managed to return the jade back to Zhao. During the following three years (282 BC to 280 BC), Qin attacked Zhao multiple times, capturing cities such as Shicheng (Áü≥Âüé), Lin (Ëó∫), Lishi (Èõ¢Áü≥), Qi (Á•Å) and Guanglang (ÂÖâÁãºÂüé), killing 20,000 men, and forcing Zhao to agree to send hostages and concede lands in exchange for returning the captured cities. During the armistice meeting held at Mianchi (Êæ†Ê±†), King Zhaoxiang attempted to humiliate King Huiwen, but was forced to back down when Lin Xiangru threatened to physically harm the Qin king. In 273 BC, Wei and Zhao allied together to attack Han's Huayang (ËèØÈôΩ). Qin offered military help to Han, defeating and killing 130,000 Wei soldiers, and drowning 20,000 Zhao soldiers in the Yellow River. In 269 BC, King Huiwen of Zhao backflipped on his previous promise to send hostages and concede land. In response, Qin attacked Zhao and laid siege to Yuyu (ÈñºËàá). The siege was lifted after the Zhao general Zhao She (Ë∂ôÂ•¢) ambushed and decisively defeated the invading Qin army. In 265 BC, Qin struck back at Zhao and captured three cities, and King Huiwen of Zhao resorted to sending his son to the state of Qi in exchange for Qi assistance, which forced the Qin army to withdraw. = Battle of Changping and the Siege of Handan = In 262 BC, Bai Qi attacked and cut off the Shangdang Commandery from the Han mainland. King Huanhui of Han was fearful of Qin military power, and decided to concede Shangdang. However, the local commanders Jin Tao (Èù≥Èªà) refused to do so, thus King Huaihui then replaced him with a new commander Feng Ting (È¶Æ‰∫≠), but he refused as well and instead suggested surrendering the region to the state of Zhao, with the intention of bringing on a conflict between Qin and Zhao. Despite opposition from his brother Lord Pingyang (Âπ≥ÈôΩÂêõ), King Xiaocheng of Zhao and Lord Pingyuan both decided to accept the annexation of Shangdang. This, as expected, did not go down well in Qin. So, the very next year (261 BC), Qin general Wang He (ÁéãÈΩï) attacked Shangdang, and the Zhao general, Lian Po (ÂªâÈ†ó), led 200,000 men to reinforce and defend the region, starting the biggest and bloodiest conflict between these two most powerful military states. After his vanguard forces suffered numerous setbacks, Lian Po recognized that the Zhao army were underpowered against their Qin enemies in field battles, so he readjusted the strategies and dug in with a 100 li-long defensive line near Changping, and decided to wait out and exhaust the Qin supply lines (which were at least three times longer than Zhao's, hence more difficult to maintain). This strategy worked, as the Qin offensives could not effectively penetrate the well-entrenched Zhao positions for over a year. Logistically strained, the Qin army attempted to engage in pitched battles, but Lian Po consistently refused to meet them in open battles. At this point, both sides increased the size of their forces at Changping, with the Zhao numbering 450,000 and the Qin numbering 550,000. Unable to break the stalemate, Qin began using spies stationed within Zhao to spread rumours about Lian Po being old, cowardly and incompetent. King Xiaocheng believed the rumours, and decided to dismiss Lian Po and replace him with Zhao Kuo (Ë∂ôÊã¨), the son of the late Zhao She, despite objections from chancellor Lin Xiangru and Zhao Kuo's own mother. Zhao Kuo, an arrogant young man with great philosophical knowledge of military strategies but no real combat experience, immediately reversed all of Lian Po's strategic arrangements upon arriving at the frontline. He led the Zhao army away from the protection of Lian Po's defensive structures, and sought to actively engage Qin in pitched battles. At the same time, King Zhaoxiang of Qin secretly appointed the feared Bai Qi as the new general of the Qin army, and conscripted every Qin man over 15 years of age as auxiliaries. Bai Qi then used feigned defeats to lure the overconfident Zhao Kuo into an ambush, trapping over 400,000 Zhao soldiers in a valley. Zhao Kuo's army, cut off from their base camp, were without supplies for 46 days and became severely demoralised. After multiple failed attempts to breach the Qin lines, Zhao Kuo led a final breakout assault where he was shot dead by Qin archers, along with 200,000 out of the 400,000 Zhao soldiers. Bai Qi then executed the remaining 200,000 Zhao prisoners by burying them alive, sparing only 240 of the youngest men to go back to Zhao to spread the news of the massacre of the Zhao army. The devastating defeat at Changping greatly shocked the state of Zhao, which descended into an atmosphere of despair and sorrow. Bai Qi wanted to take advantage of the victory at Changping and immediately lay siege to the Zhao capital of Handan (ÈÇØÈÑ≤). This frightened the states of Zhao and Han greatly, so they sent Su Dai (Ëòá‰ª£, Su Qin's brother) to bribe Fan Ju (ËåÉÈõé, or Fan Sui ËåÉÁù¢), who was then the Qin chancellor and jealous of Bai Qi's military achievement. Fan Ju persuaded King Zhaoxiang to halt the offensives, citing as the reason that the soldiers needed to rest after years of war. Qin agreed to an armistice in exchange of the states of Zhao and Han conceding lands. Bai Qi was furious at this because he believed Qin had just forfeited a chance to annihilate Zhao once and for all, and resigned his position in protest. However, Zhao soon changed its mind and refused to cede the lands it promised, and attempted to lobby an anti-Qin alliance with the other states. King Zhaoxiang then ordered an attack on Zhao in late 259 BC, laying siege to Handan. He wanted Bai Qi to lead the attack, but the still angry Bai Qi bluntly refused to assume the position citing illness. Instead, he advised King Zhaoxiang to call off the siege as the window of opportunity for an easy victory was already gone, because Lord Pingyuan had managed to secure military reinforcements from Chu and Wei, led by the famous Lord Chunshen and Lord Xinling. King Zhaoxiang did not take in his advice and instead appointed Wang Ling (ÁéãÈôµ) as the commander of the siege. Wang Ling's attack on Handan did not go well due to the fierce Zhao resistance, and King Zhaoxiang again decided to invite Bai Qi to command the siege, but Bai Qi again advised him that Qin had a very low chance of winning this campaign. King Zhaoxiang was unhappy to hear Bai Qi's counsel, so he replaced Wang Lin with Wang He and continued the siege. In 257 BC, the Qin army was suffering losses inflicted by reinforcements from the states of Chu and Wei. King Zhaoxiang then personally visited Bai Qi and attempted to coerce him into taking the command position with royal authority. When Bai Qi once again advised abandoning the siege, King Zhaoxiang was so angry that he stripped Bai Qi's titles and exiled him. Fan Ju then falsely accused to King Zhaoxiang that Bai Qi was cursing the King behind his back, so King Zhaoxiang decreed the forced suicide of Bai Qi. This did not improve the situation for the Qin offensive, and the Qin sustained heavy casualties under the combined assault of Wei, Chu and Zhao, and the Qin army was routed and went into a general retreat. The three-state alliance then pursued and attacked Qin, reinforced by the Han army that had recently joined them. The combined forces recaptured Hedong, Anyang, Taiyuan, Pilao, Wu'an, Shangdang and Runan. The Qin expeditionary force lost most of its men in the retreat. King Zhaoxiang's ignoring of Bai Qi's advice had sown bitter fruits at the end. In 256 BC, Qin struck back at Zhao again, with general Zhao Chan (Ë∂ôÊëª) killing 90,000 men and capturing over 20 counties. Zhao would continue to be at war with Qin into the years following King Zhaoxiang's death, including participating in a fruitless anti-Qin offensive by the five-state alliance in 247 BC, and two major victories against Qin invasions in 240 BC and 231 BC (the latter won by general Li Mu), but it never recovered to its formal glory prior to the Battle of Changping. Meanwhile, Qin had fully regained its strength to become the only dominant military power, and went on to capture the Zhao capital Handan in 229 BC and eventually conquer the whole of Zhao in 222 BC.  Conquest of Eastern Zhou  The authority of the Zhou court had been declining since the very beginning of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. When King Ping of Zhou abandoned the old capital of Haojing and relocated east to Luoyi, the new capital's crown land (ÁéãÁïø) was significantly smaller and less developed compared to the old capital. The royal Zhou court, which had been humiliated by Haojing's sacking, became increasingly reliant on the support of the vassal states. King Ping's son, King Huan, later had a falling out with one of the strongest vassals, Duke Zhuang of Zheng. The young King Huan decided to assert his authority as the lord paramount and personally led an expedition in 707 BC to punish on the state of Zheng, but was badly defeated in the Battle of Xuge. King Huan himself was wounded in the shoulder by an arrow, and was forced to back down and negotiate peace with Duke Zhuang. This destroyed any remaining prestige and authority the Eastern Zhou royal court had over its vassals, and confirmed the de facto independence of the feudal states. The Zhou court was so impoverished after that defeat that, when King Huan died in 697 BC, it took the court seven years to get enough funding for a fitting royal funeral. During the reign of King Xiang of Zhou, his half-brother Prince Dai (ÁéãÂ≠êÂ∏∂) twice attempted to usurp the throne in 649 BC and 635 BC, both times by conspiring with Quanrong to lay siege to the capital. King Xiang required military assistance by the vassal states to reinstate himself on both occasions, and was forced to increase their fiefs each time as commendations. This further weakened the image of the Eastern Zhou court in the eyes of the vassal states, and progressively relegated it to the status of a neglected figurehead. The situation only became worse for the Eastern Zhou court after the Spring and Autumn period ended. None of the warring states held any respect and marginalized the Zhou court to the de facto status equivalent of a minor vassal state. During the reign of King Kao of Zhou, he decreed a portion of crown land around Wangcheng (ÁéãÂüé, the older of Luoyi's twin cities) to his brother Ji Xie (Âß¨Êè≠) in 440 BC, naming the fief \\"the state of West Zhou\\" (Ë•øÂë®Âúã). In 367 BC during the reign of King Xian of Zhou, the 2nd duke of West Zhou, Duke Wei (Ë•øÂë®Â®ÅÂÖ¨) died, and one of his younger sons, Lord Gen (ÂÖ¨Â≠êÊ†π), rebelled against his brother Duke Hui (Ë•øÂë®ÊÉ†ÂÖ¨) and seceded a portion of his home state centred around Gong (ÈûèÂú∞) with the support of Marquess Cheng of Zhao (Ë∂ôÊàê‰æØ) and Marquess Gong of Han (ÈüìÂÖ±‰æØ), naming it the \\"state of East Zhou\\" (Êù±Âë®Âúã). This effectively splintered two separate vassal states out of the Eastern Zhou royal court, further decreasing the crown land. In 344 BC, Marquess Hui of Wei gathered other vassal lords to pay a visit to King Xian of Zhou, but instead used the occasion to declare himself king. This initially backfired and caused other states to turn hostile towards Wei, but in 334 BC Duke Wei of Qi openly supported King Hui of Wei's crowning, and declared himself king as well, prompting the state of Chu to attack Qi with the intention of forcing Qi to abandon the kingship. However, in 325 BC Duke Huiwen of Qin also declared kingship and supported Qi's crowning, and King Hui of Wei openly encouraged Marquess Wei of Han to claim kingship, who accepted the proposal and crowned himself in 323 BC along with the ruler of Yan and Zhongshan. Out of all the major states, only Marquess Wuling of Zhao refused to declare kingship at the time, as he considered his state not being strong enough to handle the diplomatic fallout, and titled himself \\"Lord\\" (Âêõ) instead. By this point, nearly all major states had claimed royal status equivalent to that of the King of Zhou, and it effectively spelled the complete death of Zhou authority. In 315 BC, the two splinter states of East Zhou and West Zhou declared autonomy and divided up the remaining crown lands between themselves, reducing the King of Zhou, whose seat, Chengzhou, was within East Zhou, to more or less a puppet at the mercy of the duke's charity. When King Nan of Zhou ascended in 314 BC, he was expelled by the Duke of East Zhou, who no longer wanted to provide for a less than useful monarch. King Nan was forced to beg for protection from the Duke of West Zhou, and moved out of Chengzhou to Wangcheng. In 307 BC, King Nan of Zhou hosted King Wu of Qin, who just returned victorious against Han at the Battle of Yiyang. During the visit, King Wu, a keen wrestler, decided to try lifting the \\"dragon-patterned red cauldron\\" (ÈæçÁ¥ãËµ§Èºé) in the Zhou palace. He died from the attempt, bleeding from his eyes and breaking his shin bones. After the childless King Wu died, his hostage half-brother Ying Ji returned to claim the throne as King Zhaoxiang. In 293 BC, East Zhou decided to ally itself with the states of Han and Wei, and sent troops to help attacking Qin. However, the combined forces of this alliance was destroyed at Yique by the young Qin general Bai Qi, with 240,000 men killed and their commander Gongsun Xi (ÂÖ¨Â≠´Âñú) captured and executed. After this loss, the East Zhou was unable to actively participate in future interstate struggles in any significant fashion. In 256 BC, Duke Wu of West Zhou (Ë•øÂë®Ê≠¶ÂÖ¨) allied with other states to stop the Qin offensive on the Han city of Yangcheng. In retaliation, King Zhaoxiang of Qin sent general Jiu to invade West Zhou, successfully breaking into Wangcheng. The Duke Wu was taken to Xianyang to beg for mercy, conceding all his lands. Both King Nan and Duke Wu would die later that year, and the subsequent Duke of West Zhou, Duke Wen (Ë•øÂë®ÊñáÂÖ¨), was exiled to Danhuju (ÊÜöÁãêËÅö). Because the Zhou royal court had fallen from power and King Nan had died without a successor, the Eastern Zhou Dynasty collapsed, ending 879 years of Zhou monarchy. The remaining East Zhou state was also conquered by Qin chancellor L√º Buwei seven years later in 249 BC during the reign of King Zhaoxiang's grandson King Zhuangxiang, after Duke Jing of East Zhou attempted to form an anti-Qin alliance with other states.  Legacy  King Zhaoxiang died at age 75 in 251 BC, having outlived his eldest son, who died in 267 BC while serving as a hostage in the state of Wei. He was succeeded by his second son King Xiaowen. Reigning over 55 years, he was one of the longest-serving rulers during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. Although making numerous policy mistakes during his later years, his aggressive territorial expansions were pivotal in consolidating the state of Qin as the dominant military powerhouse in the late Warring States period. It was the strategic dominance established during his reign that paved the way to Qin's eventual successful unification of China under his great-grandson, Ying Zheng. In manga and anime Kingdom, he was described as a \\"War God\\", which he led Qin through bloody battles alongside his 6 most elite generals, including Bai Qi, Wang He, Wang Yi, Liao, Sima Cuo and Hu Shang.

Nowadays, children buy colourful plastic stones instead of finding pebbles. It can be played alone or with friends. The stones are called gonggitdol (). Since only a few stones and a flat surface are needed for play, the game can be played by anyone almost anywhere. An equivalent game also exists in Nepal and is known as 'gatti'.This game is also played in South India especially in Tamilnadu and Kerala. It's called \\"kallu\\"(meaning stones). same rules apply only that they play using pebbles. The game is also called Jjagebatgi in North Gyeongsang Province, Salgu in South Gyeongsang Province, and Datjjakgeoli in South Jeolla Province.Í≥µÍ∏∞ÎÜÄÏù¥:Encyclopedia of korea cultuere Gameplay The game generally begins with each player tossing the stones from the palm of their hand into the air. While airborne, the player switches their hand backside up. The gonggi stones are then caught on the back of the hand. The person with the leading amount plays first. How to play gonggi * Level 1: The stones are thrown on the playing surface and the player picks a stone to throw up in the air. While airborne, the player picks up one stone on the playing surface. Then, the player catches the stone. These steps are repeated until all the stones have been caught. * Level 2: The stones are thrown on the playing surface again. However, at this level, the player picks up the stones two at a time. * Level 3: The stones are thrown on the playing surface. The stones are picked up once in a cluster of three, and the other in the amount of one. * Level 4: The player throws one stone in the air, places the others on the surface, and catches the airborne stone. Then the player tosses the same stone again, but this time, picks up the four clustered stones on the playing surface and catches the airborne stone. * Level 5: The player tosses the stones from the palm of their hand into the air. While airborne, the player switches their hand backside up. The stones are then caught on the back of the hand. Then, the player throws the stones in the air and catches them. The number of stones caught amount to the score. There are various tricks in this phase. Some examples are \\"The Dragon\\" and \\"The Clap‚ÄìToss\\". However, such ostentations are not allowed in official game play. =Various tricks in Level 5= * Dragon While the stones are airborne, the player switches their hand backside up, catches several stones, switches their hand backside down, and catches the stones that are left over. * Clap Toss While the stones are airborne, the player claps their hand before catching the stones. Both ‚Äúdragon‚Äù and ‚Äúclap-toss‚Äù gives the player twice the score; twice the number of stones. Crisis The game is called crisis because when a player reaches a certain score, the player has to go through crisis. In Korea, the crisis scores are usually the multiples of 5(5, 10, 15, ... ) or numbers that include 3, 6, or 9(3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 19, 23, 26, 29, 30, ‚Ä¶.). When a player reaches a crisis score, the rules become different: * Level 1: The stones are thrown on the playing surface by the player. However, unlike the original game, where the player can choose which stone to throw up first, in crisis, other players choose the first stone for the player. The steps that follow after are the same. While the first stone is airborne, the player picks up another stone on the playing surface. Then, the player catches the stone. These steps are repeated until all the stones get caught. Since other players don‚Äôt want the player to earn more points, they choose the stone that is the hardest for the player to carry on. For example, in the first level, if two stones touch each other, other players make sure not to choose either one of the two stones. As a result, the player has to go through a crisis of needing to grab each stone without touching the other stone. * Level 2&3: The stones are thrown on the playing surface again, and like level 1, other players choose the first stone to throw for the player. Other steps are the same. * Level 4: The player covers their hand over the 5 stones and shakes it on the ground. When another player shouts, ‚Äústop!‚Äù, the player stops shaking. One of the other players picks up one stone carefully and throws it at the other 4 stones. The player picks up the stone that was thrown and continues level 4 by throwing it up in the air, grabbing the other stones, and catching the airborne stone. Other players try to throw the stone with accuracy and strength in order to make the other 4 stones scatter. The more they scatter, the harder it is for the player to grab at 4 stones at once. * Level 5: Before the player tosses the stones from the palm of their hand into the air, other players choose between ‚Äòeven‚Äô and ‚Äòodd‚Äô. The player has to catch that amount of stones on the back of the hand. For example, if other players call out ‚Äòodd,‚Äô the player has to catch either 1 or 3 or 5 stones. If the player fails to do that, the stones go on to the next person, and the player has to do level 5 again in the next turn. Snail This game is usually introduced to children before they learn how to play gonggi. The main and the only difference between snail and gonggi is how to grab the stone. In snail, the edge of the player‚Äôs hand has to be stuck on the ground at every step. Instead of throwing a stone up in the air, the player sweeps his hand across the ground in a large circle and grabs a certain number of stones. The number of stones the player has to grab at once is same as gonggi. Snail is an easy way to make oneself familiar with the number of stones one has to catch at each level. Genius Gonggi This game is taught to people who are adept in playing gonggi. The difference from gonggi is that the player doesn‚Äôt throw one stone in the air but all stones that are in the player‚Äôs hand. After throwing multiple stones, the player grabs other stone(s) from the ground and catches all the stones they threw. Like snail, the number of stones the player has to grab is same as gonggi. Playing calls There are many playing calls in the Gonggi game. The standard calls have been listed here. The penalty for a \\"mess‚Äìup\\" requires that the player who has perpetrated it pass the stones to the next player. * A \\"double touch\\" occurs when a player physically touches the Gonggi stone(s) more than once. * A \\"mushroom\\" or a \\"diamond\\" occurs when a Gonggi stone is balanced on a diagonal position. In some versions, this orientation may be worth either extra points or the instant end of the player's turn. * An \\"overhead\\" occurs when a player throws a Gonggi stone in any distance above their head. * A \\"drop\\" occurs when a player, after catching all 5 Gonggi stones, drops a stone on to the playing surface. * A \\"fixation\\" occurs in level 5 when a player deliberately adjusts the Gonggi stones in their hand. * An \\"interception\\" is when another person distracts the person who is currently playing. * A \\"kong\\" occurs when a player fails catch the stone at once and catches it by bouncing it on their hand several times accidentally. * A \\"movement\\" occurs when a player moves their position to catch or grab another stone. It is forbidden in the official game but is usually allowed in other games. * A \\"tree frog\\" occurs when a player, in level 3, picks up one stone first, and then pick the leftover three. (The player is supposed to pick the cluster of three first, and then the amount of one) See also *Korean culture *List of Korea-related topics *Yut *Knucklebones References Category:Korean games Category:Children's games Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Gonggi"},{"id":"6667872","text":"Gornji Breg may refer to: * Gornji Breg (region), a small geographical region in north-eastern Baƒçka, Vojvodina, Serbia * Gornji Breg, Senta, a village in Senta municipality, Vojvodina, Serbia ","title":"Gornji Breg"},{"id":"6667911","text":"Shri Mangesh, also popularly known as Mangireesh or Manguesh, is the Presiding Deity at one of Goa's most popular prominent temples.

This is distinct from Ishta-devata (personal tutelar) and village deities.  In practice  The word Kuladevata is derived from two words: Kula, meaning clan and Devata, meaning deity. Thus, it can be said that Kuladevatas are deities which are worshiped by particular clans. The deity can be a male, female, animal or even an object, like a holy stone. Hindu families make a pilgrimage to the Kuladevata or Kuladevi temple to obtain the blessing of the deity after an auspicious occasion such as a wedding. Kuladevatas are worshiped in several sects of Hinduism and Jainism. In the state of Maharashtra, the Kuladevatas are mainly manifestations of Shiva or Shakti such as Khandoba or Bhavani, respectively. In the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan, these deities are generally, the various manifestations of Parvati, the wife of Shiva. She is worshiped by different names by different clans. The Indian King Cobra (Nag) is also a famous Kuladevata. It is known by several names, such as, Nagadevata and Nagabaapji and is worshiped by several Hindu, Jain and Kshatriya clans. Some Kshatriya clans also claim themselves to be \\"Nagavanshi\\" or Descendants of the Naga. In South India, Balaji of Tirupati is one of the main Kuladevatas. Dutta Chowdhury family of Andul village. alt= In Kerala, amongst the Nair community, each tharavadu (ancestral family house) has a Kula Devata - often, the devi form of Bhadra, besides Para Devatas of ancestors in tharavadu temples. However, each branch of the family and members also worship Ishta-Devata depending upon village deities and choices. In Andhra Pradesh, Goddess Vasavi Kanyakaparameshwari is the Kuladevi for the Arya Vysya community. In Tamil Nadu, Goddess Kamakshi, Goddess Renukamba and Lord Muruga are family deities among many others, for many Brahmin Iyers and also to Maravar And Vellalars. Goddess Bhadrakali is the tutelary deity of Nadars. Majority of the Nadar Settlements will have a temple for Goddess Bhadrakali. Goddess Angalaparameshwari for majority of chettiars and vellalars. Lord Narashima for Brahmin Iyengars and also to Naidu. Worship of Kuladevta is very much prominent amongst the Brahmins and Kshatriyas of Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra, that are the Konkani Saraswats, Daivajnas and Konkani Kharvis. Most of the Kuladevata temples are found in Goa, Shantadurga, Mahalakshmi, Nagesh, Mangesh, Ramnath to name a few. Kuladevatas play a very pious role in the Saraswat Brahmins, Daivajna Brahmins and Konkani Kharvis, it can even supplant the role of the Istadevata.

Gordon for Allied Artists Pictures Corporation, and starring Richard Carlson. The film was featured in the fourth season of the television series Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K).  Plot  Tormented Jazz pianist Tom Stewart (Carlson), who lives in a Cape Cod island community, is preparing to marry his fianc√©e Meg Hubbard (Lugene Sanders). Shortly before the wedding, Tom's old girlfriend Vi Mason (Juli Reding) visits and informs him that she will end his relationship with Meg, using blackmail if necessary. While she is arguing with him atop a lighthouse, the railing she is leaning on gives way. She manages to hang on briefly, but Tom refuses to help and watches her fall to her death. The next day, Tom sees Vi's body floating in the water. After he retrieves her, the body turns into seaweed. He tries to forget what he has seen, but over the next few days, Vi's watch washes up on the beach, strange footprints appear in the sand, Vi's ghost appears and tells Tom that she will haunt him for the rest of his life, and when Meg's little sister Sandy (Susan Gordon) asks to see the wedding ring Tom will give Meg, a disembodied hand makes off with it. Soon afterward, during a party for Tom and Meg, Vi's disembodied head appears in a photo a guest takes of the couple. Later, when Tom's alone, Vi taunts him that she will now use her voice to tell the world how Tom Stewart killed her. To add to Tom's dilemma, a ferry-driving beatnik comes looking for Tom, intent on collecting the $5.00 Vi owes him for her trip to the island. Tom's haste to pay the fellow off causes the shifty man to stick around, and his attempts to blackmail Tom lead to his death. Unbeknownst to Tom, Sandy has inadvertently witnessed the murder. Sandy keeps quiet about what she has seen. At the wedding she almost speaks up at the point in the ceremony where the minister asks if anyone objects to the marriage, but before she can speak, the church's front doors burst open and causes the flowers all to wilt as the candles to die out, bringing the ceremony to an abrupt, unpleasant halt. Later that night, Tom goes to the lighthouse and tells Vi that he is leaving the island. When he finds Sandy listening in, he realizes that he is trapped: Sandy knows too much and could possibly tell Meg and the others. Desperately Tom leads Sandy up to the broken lighthouse railing with the intent to push her over, but Vi's ghost swoops down on him, causing him to go over the edge as Sandy watches. When the islanders search for Tom's body, the first one they find is Vi's. Shortly afterward, Tom's body is found and placed next to Vi's body, which somehow manages to turn and lay its arm across his body. On Vi's dead hand is the wedding ring that was supposed to be Meg's, signaling that Tom is now stuck forever with Vi.

She has been ministering in Hong Kong since 1966. The early years of her Hong Kong ministry are chronicled in the book Chasing the Dragon (1980). History Pullinger graduated from the Royal College of Music in London having specialized in the oboe. At the age of 22 she wanted to be a missionary, so she wrote to various missionary organizations. Unable to find support from missionary organizations, she then sought advice from Richard Thomson, a minister in Shoreditch, who told her that she should buy a ticket for a boat going as far as she could get and to pray to know when to get off the boat. At first she wanted to go to Africa, but then she had a dream that impressed upon her the idea of going to Hong Kong. She followed the vicar's advice and went to Hong Kong by boat in 1966. However, when she arrived she knew no one there and had only $10 on hand. The only reason the immigration officers allowed her in was because her mother's godson was a police officer there. She found work as a primary school teacher in the Kowloon Walled City, which in the 1960s was not policed and consequently had become one of the world's largest opium producing centres, run by Chinese criminal Triad gangs. Jackie got to know some of the gang members and leaders, despite the danger, and helped them to find that Jesus can give a purpose and reason for living without having to use drugs.Booth, Martin pp. 99-100 Later she established a youth centre that helped the drug addicts and street sleepers inside the walled city. She also taught music at St. Stephen's Girls' College.

Pierce (born January 12, 1937) is the cardiothoracic surgeon and chemical engineer who led development of the first pneumatic heart assist pump. The Pierce-Donachy Ventricular Assist Device, also known as the Penn State Assist Pump, was designated an International Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1990. Born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Pierce received his B.S. degree from Lehigh University in chemical engineering in 1958 and subsequently attended the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine where he obtained an M.D. degree in 1962, together with an Alpha Omega Alpha honor. He received his surgical training at the University of Pennsylvania and at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. In 1970, Pierce was asked to join the surgical faculty at the new College of Medicine of Pennsylvania State University (Penn State Hershey Medical Center). He was appointed professor of surgery in 1977 and subsequently served as chief of the Division of Artificial Organs, chief of the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, director of surgical research, and associate chair of the Department of Surgery. He was awarded the Faculty Scholar Medal in 1983 and in 1986 was named Evan Pugh Professor, the University's highest academic honor. At Penn State, Pierce established an interdisciplinary group to develop mechanical circulatory support devices and the artificial heart. The original pneumatic heart assist pump, now known as the Thoratec ventricular assist device (Thoratec Pneumatic VAD), has been used in nearly 4,000 patients for right, left, and biventricular support. His pioneering work led him to be considered around the world as a father of the ventricular assist device. The group, including Pierce, James Donachy and its current chief, Gerson Rosenberg, went on in partnership with Arrow International of Reading, Pennsylvania, to develop the Arrow Lion Heart, an implantable, permanent, left ventricular heart assist system powered by a wearable, external NiCd battery. The pump represented the first successful use of a transcutaneous energy transfer system, eliminating any transcutaneous wire, and the first clinical use of a compliance sac, eliminating the need for a transcutaneous vent. It has been used in over thirty patients to date. Pierce's artificial-organs group subsequently focused on a completely implantable electromechanical artificial heart consisting of two prosthetic blood pumps actuated by pusher plates driven by a compact DC motor. This biventricular heart pump, with its microprocessor-based digital control system, transcutaneous energy transfer system, and implanted compliance sac, has been successfully used in numerous calf implant studies. Pierce received the 2007 Jacobson Innovation Award, given by the American College of Surgeons to \\"living surgeons who have been innovators of a new development or technique in any field of surgery.\\" He won \\"in recognition of his pioneering work in the conception and development of mechanical circulatory support and the total artificial mechanical heart and his contributions to surgical bioengineering and patient care.\\" Pierce has edited three books and published more than 280 articles and 90 book chapters. He holds nine United States patents.

Santos  When the Spanish first arrived in Puerto Rico, one of their primary tools in converting the indigenous Ta√≠no population were statuettes, known as Santos, depicting the Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ, and other Catholic icons (the practice of religious sculpture already existed on the island through the Ta√≠nos‚Äô use of zemi figures). As there were not many churches and missionaries during the early years of Spanish occupation, Santos were crucial in establishing the Catholic faith in Puerto Rico, as the converts would use the Santos in domestic settings for various religious purposes. Early craftsmen of these Santos, known as santeros (or santeras, if female) would primarily create the figures by using Spanish Cedar wood, clay, or stone, and applying oil paints, and were heavily influenced by the Spanish Baroque style, with the early Santo figures being elaborately detailed with dramatic expressions. Many Santos were adorned with aureolas (halos), though depictions of Jesus exclusively used a three-pointed halo referred to as the Tres Potencias. In the years after Spanish Colonialism, Santos moved away from the Baroque style and into roughly 2 categories: Autoctono and Contemporary. Autoctono (Naive) is characterized by local Puerto Rican colors and simple, childlike features, while Contemporary is a broader category reflective of Santos that are made without necessarily having a direct mystical or religious influence. Santos vary in size, but are usually around eight to twenty inches tall. Over the years, Santos have become a very personal and important tradition in many Puerto Rican households: they are housed in special wooden boxes called nichos where people pray for assistance and protection, and families often pass down collections of Santos (for instance, depictions of the Nativity Scene) for future generations to add new figures and restore old ones. After the 1898 United States Invasion of Puerto Rico, Santos as a handmade craft somewhat reduced in popularity, as Protestant missionaries called for converts to dispose of and destroy the figures, and general modernizations on the island led to a reduced interest in this long-standing tradition. As a result, plastic, mass-produced statuettes of Catholic figures have become more popular as an alternative to traditional Santos craftsmanship.  Caretas  Caretas (masks) which are worn during carnivals, are also popular. Similar masks signifying evil spirits were used in both Spain and Africa, though for different purposes. The Spanish used their masks to frighten lapsed Christians into returning to the church, while tribal Africans used them as protection from the evil spirits they represented. Puerto Rican caretas always bear at least several horns and fangs, true to their historical origins. While they are usually constructed of papier-m√¢ch√©, coconut shells and fine metal screening are sometimes used as well. Though red and black were originally the typical colors for carnitas, their palette has expanded to include a wide variety of bright hues and patterns. Visual arts Perhaps the strongest Spanish influenced on Puerto Rican arts was in painting. During the colonial period, native-born painters emulated classic European styles. The first of these artists to gain international acclaim, Jos√© Campeche, learned techniques from both his father, who was a former slave who had purchased his freedom by carving altarpieces, and from exiled Spanish artist Luis Paret. His work concentrated on religious themes and portraits of important citizens in Spanish Rococo style. Still regarded as the most important 18th-century painter in the Americas, Campeche is also credited with creating the Puerto Rican national painting. Hacienda La Fortuna by Francisco Oller (1885). Brooklyn Museum. In the 19th century, Francisco Oller followed in Campeche's footsteps. He studied in both Madrid and Paris, which greatly influenced his work. Although his paintings often show an Impressionist or Realist style, he altered his style with each piece to suit the subject matter. Landscapes, portraits, and still lifes were all among his works. After moving back to Puerto Rico in 1884, Oller became interested in portraying Puerto Rican subject matter. He also founded an art academy and wrote a book on drawing and painting the natural world. By the end of the 20th century, painting no longer defined Puerto Rican art as it once had. \\"A group of contemporary artists who came into maturity in the 1990s broke away from nationalistic agendas so crucial to previous generations of artists from Puerto Rico\\", according to curator Silvia Karman Cubi√±a. \\"Instead their works are informed by more personal issues, as well as broader topics such as gender, consumerism, world history, film, and literature.\\"Silvia Karman Cubi√±a, ‚ÄúNotes on Neoconceptualism from Puerto Rico‚Äù in None of the Above: Contemporary Work by Puerto Rican Artists (Hartford, CT: Real Art Ways, 2004), 22.

The Check 21 Act makes the digital image of a check legally acceptable for payment purposes, just like a traditional paper check. Before 2004, if someone deposited a check in an account with one bank, the banks would have to physically exchange the paper check to the bank on which the check is drawn before the money would be credited to the account in the deposit bank. Under Check 21, the deposit bank can simply send an image of the check to the drawing bank. This reduction of the transportation time from total processing life cycle of a check provides a longer time for the corporation to process the checks. Often, this additional processing time allows the corporation to deposit more items at an earlier cutoff time than they otherwise would. In addition, most banks offering Remote Deposit Capture have extended the cutoff times for deposit-8:00 pm, while the deadline for regular paper deposits is 4:00 pm. The practical effect of the law is that checks can still be deposited and cleared, even if a disaster makes it impossible for banks to exchange the physical paper checks with each other.  Mobile deposit  On July 4, 2009, Element Federal Credit Union (formerly WV United FCUWV United Federal Credit Union is First with iPhone-based Remote Check Scan & Deposit Finovate Blog, Jim Bruene Posted on July 12, 2009) became the first financial institution to deploy a smartphone app for its members. Members were already able to submit checks for deposit by using a scanner and secure web portal. USAA in 2009 became the first bank to enable customers to deposit checks with a smartphone. Mobile Deposit allows smart phone users to snap a picture of the check with the phone's camera. The application automatically processes the picture and sends it to the bank for deposit. The customer does not mail in the original check, instead voiding or discarding it. According to an industry study conducted in late 2013, only 10% of U.S. banks and credit unions offered mobile deposit, though many more planned to do so. Some of the largest U.S. banks offer mobile deposit, including Bank of America, Chase, Citibank and Wells Fargo and some in Canada, RBC, TD, CIBC, Tangerine offer mobile deposit to retail banking customers.  Implications for businesses and consumers  A side effect of the Check 21 Act is that, because the digital image of a check is now considered a legal document, bank customers who get paid with a check can scan an image of the check and deposit it into their account from their home or office if their bank supports doing so. Advocates of Check 21 claim that remote deposit saves time and money because businesses who use it no longer have to send an employee or a courier to take their checks to the bank. Another potential benefit is that it cuts down on paperwork, and therefore reduces the chances of making mistakes or losing checks in the process of depositing them. Bounced checks also show up faster when processed through remote deposit. Critics, and some advocates, contend that remote deposit ‚Äî and by extension, the entire Check 21 Act ‚Äî is an attempt by the banking industry to eliminate \\"float,\\" the standard one- or two-day waiting period between the time someone writes a check and the time the money is actually taken out of their account. Now that checks can be cashed and cleared electronically, it is theoretically possible for a bank to take the money out of a checking account on the same day a check is used in payment. This would make checks behave much like debit cards, making it impossible, for example, to write a check to pay a bill at the grocery store, then rush to the bank to make a deposit so the check doesn't bounce. So far, all banks in the United States still operate with at least a one-day float period.  Use  Remote deposit use has grown. A June 2009 survey by group Independent Community Bankers of America found that 62% of banks in the United States offered merchant remote deposit, and 78% had plans to adopt the technology by 2011. Client adoption of remote deposit capture was projected to reach 1 million by 2010, and over 5 million by 2012.Celent's estimates were published on 4 June 2007. The banking industry does not keep an official tally of how many businesses use remote deposit nationwide, but, the number is estimated to be in the tens of thousands. Several independent companies such as ProfitStars,ProfitStars BankServ, Diebold, RDM Corporation and NetDeposit claim to have signed up a few thousand customers, although several major banks have also developed their own systems and may eventually end up handling most remote deposit traffic.

Peggy finds herself hopelessly smitten with him, and he is also in love with her. They are engaged to be married, much to the consternation of the frequenters of the hotel in general and of the Hon. Mr. James Bendoyle, M.P., M.F.H., in particular. Bendoyle is the richest of all of Peggy's numerous admirers. Determined to marry her himself, he hatches a plot to obtain her affections. Learning that Umbles has a rich Uncle in South America who has not been heard of for some years, but whose return is confidently expected, he bribes a former friend named Auberon Blow, who, having fallen on hard times is employed as a hawker, to impersonate \\"Uncle Monty\\" and to excite Peggy with a life of luxury to such an extent, that the supply cut off, she will turn to anyone who can afford her the means of continuing it. This seems to be working splendidly, but the real uncle and his daughter arrive and realize immediately that there is an imposter. Bendoyle invites everyone to Friville. Here everything is resolved: the gallant hairdresser forsakes Peggy for vaudeville artist Polly; Bendoyle marries Doris, the daughter of the real uncle, while \\"Uncle Monty\\" (actually Blow) and Peggy have become so fond of each other that they decide never to part.This synopis is based on the public domain synopsis by H.J.

History The station was founded in the 1970s by Dalmatian Enterprises, Inc., which also owned KSYC-AM 1490, the original country music station in Siskiyou County. The new station was given the call letters KYRE and licensed to operate at frequency 97.7 FM. It signed on the air on June 1, 1983 and played the pop/rock format with George Calvin Booth as the station's program director and main on-air talent. In the latter years of KYRE, it was promoted as \\"Hot Hits Y98\\". Y98 later became an affiliate of AT40 with Casey Kasem on August 24, 1985. The station was purchased in 1995 by Siskiyou Radio Partners, Inc., and the call letters were changed to KSYC-FM as a way of moving the country music format over to the FM band and make way for the fast-growing news/talk format on the AM station. The frequency was also moved from FM 97.7 to FM 103.9 that same year. The station's program director became Kevin Sponsler, who was PD of the AM station before the switch. KSYC-FM quickly replaced rival KWHO-FM as the county's only country music station when that station was sold to Huth Broadcasting in 1997 and KWHO's music format changed from country to hot adult contemporary. KSYC-FM was sold to Four Rivers Broadcasting in 2000, as was KSYC, KMJC, and KMJC-FM and later KWHO (from Huth Broadcasting) in 2001.

Its elevation is 782 m. (2565 ft). Although people from Tache, Fort St. James, and Prince George visit the area, it is mostly used by members of Yekooche First Nation who spend most of the summer there before returning to Portage Reserve in the fall. The lake provides them with salmon and kokanee, while moose, deer and bear hunting can be done nearby around Salt Lake, Frank's Meadow, and a lagoon west of the camp. Frank's Meadow was likely named after a hermit named Frank who inhabited the area. People also fish at 4 Mile and 6 Mile Creek, east of the camp near Quarter Island. People from Yekooche rely on their catch from Babine Portage for winter food. History The name originates from the 19th century, when the site was used as an entry point for canoes portaging to the Hudson's Bay Company post. In the past, there were five cabins on the east side of the creek and seven on the west side, but in 2003, all but three were ignited by grass fires and burned down. The cabins on the west side of the creek were used by the Yekooche Indians during the summer hunting and salmon catching season. On the east side of the creek, one of the cabins was the original built by the Hudson's Bay Company while the 4 others belonged to Joseph Chase Ells and Company during the second half of the 20th century.

History The station signed on the air in November 1977 as KEDY 95.3 in Mount Shasta, California, owned and operated by the Shasta Cascade Broadcasting Corporation, run by David Rees Sr. It came on the heels of the success of its sister station KWSD/620. The station was taken over by David's son, David Rees Jr. in the 1980s and had played various formats from adult standards to rock and was home to many great radio talents such as Fred \\"The Big Guy\\" Gerding Jr., Timothy \\"T. Martin\\" Harris and Rick Martin (former owner/talent of what is now KHWA). David Jr's sons and daughter, Dennis, Chris, and Tricia also served as on-air talent. The frequency was moved up to 107.9 FM as the station was sold to Dalmatian Enterprises, Inc., owners of KSYC-AM-FM. KEDY was then sold to Siskiyou Radio Partners, Inc. in 1995 (owned by Tom Huth and Bob Darling), then had the call letters changed to KMJC-FM (MJC stood for \\"Magic\\") and the format was changed to oldies as the station was branded \\"Magic 108\\". KMJC-FM was then sold to Four Rivers Broadcasting in 2001, which also purchased sister stations KMJC, KSYC, and KSYC-FM. The station was then branded \\"The Mountain\\" and played eclectic (or adult album alternative) music. Then, finally the station was picked up by Educational Media Foundation, which operates K-LOVE Radio, in 2004 as Four Rivers also sold its AM stations to Jefferson Public Radio of Ashland, Oregon.

The album title is a grammatically mis-quotedThe text on Wren's tomb is \\"Si monumentum requiris circumspice\\", where requiris is active indicative second person singular present of the Latin word requiro ('I seek'); the form requires is the future tense form of that word, thus \\"If you will seek his monument look around you\\" version of the Latin epitaph on the tomb of Christopher Wren in St Paul's Cathedral (built by him), meaning \\"If you seek his monument look around you\\". This album is the first part in a trilogy of albums released by the band, followed by Fas ‚Äì Ite, Maledicti, in Ignem Aeternum in 2007 and Paracletus in 2010. The trilogy has been described as \\"a theological dispute on the divine essence of the Devil, the roles and virtues of faith and the place of man therein\\", particularly from a Theistic Satanist perspective. One interpretation of the purpose of the album is to examine and proclaim that \\"Satan is pervading every part of our material and metaphysical realms and how Man‚Äôs relationship with Him should be one of reverence and devotion.\\" The album draws on themes of putrefaction, decomposition, antinatalism, as well as the work of the French philosopher Georges Bataille.  Background and artwork  The track \\"Malign Paradigm\\" is a tribute to the Swedish black metal band Malign, and their track \\"Ashes and Bloodstench\\". \\"Drink the Devil's Blood\\" is a re-recording of the song of the same name from the band's first album, Infernal Battles, featuring new lyrics with a Eucharistic theme. The artwork is \\"both a statement on the Logos, providing metaphysical keys to a certain approach on reality, and a statement on our faith and its concrete anchors and applications in the world as every human being can actually experience it. But keep in mind: the light that illuminates us is the very same that blinds us too.\\" The band notes that the artwork is also linked to a lyric from \\"Sola Fide I\\" (\\"The heart of a lost angel is in the earth\\"), taken from Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poem \\"A Drama of Exile\\", which retells the exile of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden and Satan's role in it.  Musical style and writing  Musically, it represents a massive departure in sound from the band's previous work, both for the increase in recording and production quality as well as for the pursuit of far more avant-garde and experimental directions than the band's previous work. The album incorporates Gregorian chants, chaotic moments and significant use of dissonant and atonal riffs and chord structures. The album was also originally intentionally structured in the manner of 1970s double albums, with each LP side opening with a \\"prayer\\" (side four, which opens with \\"Carnal Malefactor\\", being an arguable exception). The album was inspired by Christian sources (often Catholic), particularly in its metaphysical discussions. The band frequently quote passages from the Christian Bible, for example 'Third Prayer' quotes Chapter 17 of the Book of Jeremiah: \\"Thus says the LORD, ‚ÄúCursed is the man who trusts in mankind, and makes flesh his strength, and whose heart turns away from the LORD.\\"\\"H√©to√Ømasia\\" is Greek for \\"preparation\\", which references the empty throne awaiting Christ's return.

The municipal's territory extends along the Saguenay and Saint Lawrence Rivers, whereas the town itself is on the small St. Catherine Bay, which is located at the confluence of these two rivers. Its elevation is 260 feet. It is the west terminus of the Baie-Ste-Catherine / Tadoussac ferry, which offers free and frequent service across the Saguenay River to Tadoussac. The ferry is part of Quebec Route 138 which is the main land link to Sept-√éles along the C√¥te-Nord. Baie-Sainte-Catherine is a gateway to the Saguenay‚ÄìSt. Lawrence Marine Park and to the Saguenay Conservation Park. Therefore it caters to tourism, particularly to whale-watching cruises on the Saint Lawrence and Saguenay Rivers. History Baie-Sainte-Catherine has the reputation of being the location of the historic meeting on May 27, 1603, between Fran√ßois Grav√© Du Pont and Samuel de Champlain and the leaders of three Indian nations with whom they concluded an agreement that opened the Saint Lawrence River to French explorers. On the stormy evening of November 27, 1686, the ship La Catherine went aground and sank in the bay at the mouth of the Saguenay River. On the 1731 map by Laure, this bay was identified as \\"Ance √† la Catherine\\" (archaic French for \\"Catherine Cove\\"). At some uncertain point in time, \\"Saint\\" was added, following the former widespread practice in Quebec of sanctifying toponyms. Around 1820, the first permanent settlers came to the Canard River area and formed a farming village. In 1843, William Price built a sawmill at the first falls on Canards River, that operated some ten years. In 1847, the mission was founded, and named \\"Saint-Firmin\\" by the bishop of Quebec. Its first cemetery opened in 1865 on Alouettes Point, followed by the first chapel of St. Firmin Mission in 1876, also on Alouettes Point. At the beginning of the 20th century, it transformed into an industrial village when another sawmill and cheese factory operated there. In 1903, the village was incorporated as the Municipality of Saint-Firmin. But since the place was called Baie-Sainte-Catherine in common use, the municipality officially adopted this name in 1984.

The Qin commander was general Bai Qi. With half of the alliance force, Bai Qi's army took the alliance's strongholds one by one. The battle ended with the capture of the alliance general Gongsun Xi (), 240,000 casualties on the alliance side, and the capture of five Han and Wei cities including Yique. After the battle, Han and Wei were forced to cede their lands to ensure further peace. Background By 294 BC, the kingdom of Qin had become a major military power in China. Its first step of conquest began with the nearby kingdoms of Wei and Han. Wei and Han had been enemies for many years, and did not pay much attention to Qin. In 294 BC Qin, under General Bai Qi, attacked Han and took an important fortress. Wei and Han realized the might of Qin, and joined forces to stop Qin from further conquests. In 294 BC, Wei and Han gathered 240,000 troops to face Qin. The battleground was a vast area including five fortresses, cities, and defensive positions along rivers and mountain ranges. Bai Qi only had 120,000 men under his command. But the alliance feared Qin's better trained and equipped troops and decided on passive defense. The battle was a stalemate until 293 BC. The battle Bai Qi noticed that Wei and Han were still hostile to each other, so he decided on the divide and conquer strategy. He scouted the area for weaknesses in the alliance defense. He drew away the attention of the main Han forces with small ambushes, then attacked the weakly defended Wei positions with the main Qin army. The officers of Wei believed that Han deliberately failed to support the Wei army positions. Hostility grew worse between the two allies. Han decided to preserve its forces and ceased trying to support Wei. Bai Qi was therefore able to avoid fighting against Han forces. Over the next few months, he defeated Wei positions one by one. Bai Qi then turned his attack against the Han forces. Eventually Han troops were trapped by Qin forces and they tried to escape. However the Qin cavalry ensured that no one made it back. Gongsun Xi was captured. Aftermath This battle brought Qin influence for the first time into central China. Wei and Han's forces were destroyed after the Battle of Yique. Both states ceded land to Qin in return for temporary peace, but their eventual destruction was ensured. Qin conquered Han in 230 BC, and conquered Wei in 225 BC.

The game has a background storyline broken consisting of five chapters, with each chapter corresponding to a different area. Synopsis The player plays the role of a scientist searching for their missing Professor Jaymour whilst re-assembling TubeTwist experiments to unlock the professor's secrets. In so doing, they must also guide balls of energy known as macrotons, which must be guided from Injector Tubes to Reactor Tubes. Three types of macrotons exist: green, blue, and exploding. The green and blue macrotons must reach the reactor of the same color to release the energy from the former. Exploding macrotons are used to clear paths for the green and blue macrotons. After completing all the experiments in a chapter, the story will continue and the player will get closer to finding the missing Professor Jaymour. Development TubeTwist, along with its story element, was originally conceived and developed by Keith Johnston and Mike Panico of Pinoli Software, who partnered with 21-6 Productions to assist in producing the game. The final core team to create the game, along with Johnston and Panico as game designers, was Justin Mette as executive producer, Dave Calabrese as artist/scripter/storywriter, Mike Panico in further roles as texture artist, environment designer and modeler, Chris Brethren as level artist, and Matt Sayre as the game composer who created the audio and music to the game.

Founded in 1996, it does business with over 400 banks in more than 50 countries, primarily supplying banks with the behind-the-scenes programs used for remote deposit, Internet bill payment, mobile payments, wire transfer payments and sending messages over the international SWIFT network. The company operates offices in Las Vegas, San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Houston and London. History BankServ was founded by a group of investors led by current CEO David Kvederis, a former senior vice president of Wells Fargo Bank. Kvederis is widely known in the financial industry for helping introduce Direct Deposit during his tenure as chairman of the National Automated Clearing House Association (now NACHA-The Electronic Payments Association) during the 1980s. He was also hired by the U.S. government in 1993 to assist with the transition from a communist to a capitalist financial system in the former Soviet republic of Lithuania. Originally incorporated under the name Nova Payments, the company now known as BankServ started with the idea of selling check scanners to grocery stores, allowing them to deposit their checks without going to the bank. But in the late 1990s, BankServ‚Äôs wire transfer business (acquired from Ictus Inc) became its main revenue source, and the idea of grocery store check conversion was abandoned. However, when the United States Congress passed the Check 21 Act in 2003, the legal requirements surrounding remote deposit became less strict, and the company decided to re-enter the business with a flagship product named DepositNow! Since 2004, BankServ has expanded into the fields of consumer remote deposit, electronic bill payment and credit card processing,BankServ Explains Various Credit Card Processing Comparisons and added an international division with the acquisition of the London-based Symtec Corporation. BankServ has received a number of awards, including nominations to Inc. Magazine's Inc. 500 list in 2003 and 2004, a list of the fastest-growing privately held corporations in the United States. Most recently, BankServ was nominated to the Inc. 5,000 Fastest Growing Private Companies list every year from 2003-2010.1 In January 2004, BankServ acquired Symtec Solutions LTD, a provider of international money transfer and SWIFT financial messaging software headquartered in London, England. In May 2009, BankServ acquired the assets of Commerciant LP, a Houston-based technology company involved in wireless credit card processing. The company now offers a handheld terminal that can process credit card transactions on the spot over various mobile phone networks. In 2010, BankServ acquired NetDeposit, one of its main rivals in the remote deposit field, from Zions Bancorporation in a primarily cash transaction. As a result of the acquisition, BankServ's check processing operations nearly doubled in size, and added new branch capture and mobile phone check deposit software. The company estimates that it now processes remote deposit transactions for more than 100,000 business customers in the United States. In August 2011, private equity firm GTCR acquired the controlling interest in BankServ, poising the company for expansion and growth. GTCR's portfolio of more than 25 companies includes fast-growing firms in the financial services and technology, healthcare and information services and technology fields. GTCR subsequently announced its intention to merge BankServ with the Israeli payments firm Fundtech Ltd., a transaction that was completed in November 2011.

While a more precise term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from before the 6th century AD to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1650 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. Overview European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European classical and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 11th century.Harvard Dictionary of Music (2nd edition, 1972): \\"Neume\\", Staff Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches and durations for a piece of music. In contrast to most popular styles that adopted the song (strophic) form or a derivation of this form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the symphony, concerto, fugue, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera, cantata, and mass. Alongside traditional musical attributes, Classical music is conscientious about drawing from and re-purposing its formal and social tradition with forms such as the Mass evolving and communicating through over a thousand years. The term \\"classical music\\" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to distinctly canonize the period from Johann Sebastian Bach to Ludwig van Beethoven as a golden age.Rushton, Julian, Classical Music, (London, 1994), 10 The earliest reference to \\"classical music\\" recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary is from about 1829. Timeline The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: * Ancient music period, before 500 AD * Early music period, which includes ** Medieval era (500‚Äì1420) including *** Ars antiqua (1170‚Äì1310) *** Ars nova (1310‚Äì1377) *** Ars subtilior (1360‚Äì1420) ** Renaissance era (1400‚Äì1600) eras * Common-practice period, which includes ** Baroque era (1600‚Äì1750) ** Galant music era (1720s‚Äì1770s) ** Classical era (1750‚Äì1820) ** Romantic era (c.1800‚Äì1910) * Late 19th-century to 20th- and 21st-centuries (1890‚Äìpresent) which includes: ** Modernist era (1890‚Äì1975) that overlaps from the late-19th century *** Impressionism (1890‚Äì1925) that also overlaps from the late-19th century *** Expressionism (1900‚Äì1930) *** Neoclassicism (1920‚Äì1950), predominantly in the inter-war period ** Postmodern era/Contemporary (1950‚Äìpresent) *** Experimental (1950‚Äìpresent) *** Minimalism (early 1960s‚Äì1990) *** Postminimalism (early 1980s‚Äìpresent) Characteristics Given the wide range of styles in European classical music, from Medieval plainchant sung by monks to Classical and Romantic symphonies for orchestra from the 1700s and 1800s to avant-garde atonal compositions from the 1900s, it is difficult to list characteristics that can be attributed to all works of that type. Nonetheless, a universal characteristic of classical music written since the late 13th century is the invariable appliance of a standardized system of precise mensural notation (which evolved into modern bar notation after 1600) for all compositions and their accurate performance. Another is the creation and development of complex pieces of solo instrumental works (e.g., the fugue). The first symphonies were produced during the Classical period; beginning in the mid 18th century, the symphony ensemble and the compositions became prominent features of Classical-period music. Complexity Works of classical repertoire often exhibit complexity in their use of orchestration, counterpoint, harmony, musical development, rhythm, phrasing, texture, and form. Whereas most popular styles are usually written in song form, classical music is noted for its development of highly sophisticated instrumental musical forms, like the concerto, symphony and sonata. Classical music is also noted for its use of sophisticated vocal/instrumental forms, such as opera. In opera, vocal soloists and choirs perform staged dramatic works with an orchestra providing accompaniment. Longer instrumental works are often divided into self-contained pieces, called movements, often with contrasting characters or moods. For instance, symphonies written during the Classical period are usually divided into four movements: # an opening Allegro in sonata form, # a slow movement, # a minuet or scherzo (in a triple metre, such as ), and # a final Allegro. These movements can then be further broken down into a hierarchy of smaller units: first sections, then periods, and finally phrases. Performance Youth concert band in performance Performers who have studied classical music extensively are said to be \\"classically trained\\". This training may come from private lessons from instrument or voice teachers or from completion of a formal program offered by a Conservatory, college or university, such as a Bachelor of Music or Master of Music degree (which includes individual lessons from professors). In classical music, \\"...extensive formal music education and training, often to postgraduate [Master's degree] level\\" is required. Performance of classical music repertoire requires a proficiency in sight-reading and ensemble playing, harmonic principles, strong ear training (to correct and adjust pitches by ear), knowledge of performance practice (e.g., Baroque ornamentation), and a familiarity with the style/musical idiom expected for a given composer or musical work (e.g., a Brahms symphony or a Mozart concerto). The key characteristic of European classical music that distinguishes it from popular music and folk music is that the repertoire tends to be written down in musical notation, creating a musical part or score. This score typically determines details of rhythm, pitch, and, where two or more musicians (whether singers or instrumentalists) are involved, how the various parts are coordinated. The written quality of the music has enabled a high level of complexity within them: fugues, for instance, achieve a remarkable marriage of boldly distinctive melodic lines weaving in counterpoint yet creating a coherent harmonic logic.Knud Jeppesen: \\"Bach's music grows out of an ideally harmonic background, against which the voices develop with bold independence that is often breath-taking.\\" Quoted from The use of written notation also preserves a record of the works and enables Classical musicians to perform music from many centuries ago. Although Classical music in the 2000s has lost most of its tradition for musical improvisation, from the Baroque era to the Romantic era, there are examples of performers who could improvise in the style of their era. In the Baroque era, organ performers would improvise preludes, keyboard performers playing harpsichord would improvise chords from the figured bass symbols beneath the bass notes of the basso continuo part and both vocal and instrumental performers would improvise musical ornaments.Gabriel Solis, Bruno Nettl. Musical Improvisation: Art, Education, and Society. University of Illinois Press, 2009. p. 150 Johann Sebastian Bach was particularly noted for his complex improvisations. During the Classical era, the composer-performer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was noted for his ability to improvise melodies in different styles.David Grayson. Mozart: Piano Concertos Nos. 20 and 21. Cambridge University Press, 1998. p. 95 During the Classical era, some virtuoso soloists would improvise the cadenza sections of a concerto. During the Romantic era, Ludwig van Beethoven would improvise at the piano.Tilman Skowronek. Beethoven the Pianist. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 160 Instrumentation and vocal practices The instruments currently used in most classical music were largely invented before the mid-19th century (often much earlier) and systematized in the 18th and 19th centuries. They consist of the instruments found in an orchestra or in a concert band, together with several other solo instruments (such as the piano, harpsichord, and organ). The symphony orchestra includes members of the string, woodwind, brass, and percussion families of instruments. The concert band consists of members of the woodwind, brass, and percussion families. It generally has a larger variety and number of woodwind and brass instruments than the orchestra but does not have a string section. However, many concert bands use a double bass. The vocal practices changed over the classical period, from the single line monophonic Gregorian chant done by monks in the Medieval period to the complex, polyphonic choral works of the Renaissance and subsequent periods, which used multiple independent vocal melodies at the same time. History Music notation from an early 14th-century English Missal, featuring the head of Christ. Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church. The major time divisions of classical music up to 1900 are the Early music period, which includes Medieval (500‚Äì1400) and Renaissance (1400‚Äì1600) eras, and the Common practice period, which includes the Baroque (1600‚Äì1750), Classical (1750‚Äì1820), and Romantic (1810‚Äì1910) eras. The current period encompasses the 20th century and the 21st-century to date and includes the Modernist musical era and the Contemporary or Postmodern musical era, the dates of which are often disputed. The dates are generalizations, since the periods and eras overlap and the categories are somewhat arbitrary, to the point that some authorities reverse terminologies and refer to a common practice \\"era\\" comprising baroque, classical, and romantic \\"periods\\". For example, the use of counterpoint and fugue, which is considered characteristic of the Baroque era (or period), was continued by Haydn, who is classified as typical of the Classical era. Beethoven, who is often described as a founder of the Romantic era, and Brahms, who is classified as Romantic, also used counterpoint and fugue, but the romantic and sometimes yearning qualities of their music define their era. The prefix neo- is used to describe a 19th-, 20th-, or 21st-century composition written in the style of an earlier era, such as Classical or Romantic. Stravinsky's Pulcinella, for example, is a neoclassical composition because it is stylistically similar to works of the Baroque era. =Roots= Burgh (2006), suggests that the roots of Western classical music ultimately lie in ancient Egyptian art music via cheironomy and the ancient Egyptian orchestra, which dates to 2695 BC. The development of individual tones and scales was made by ancient Greeks such as Aristoxenus and Pythagoras.Grout (1973), p. 28 Pythagoras created a tuning system and helped to codify musical notation. Ancient Greek instruments such as the aulos (a reed instrument) and the lyre (a stringed instrument similar to a small harp) eventually led to several modern-day instruments of a classical orchestra. The antecedent to the early period was the era of ancient music before the fall of the Roman Empire (476 AD). =Early period= Medieval era Musician playing the vielle (fourteenth-century Medieval manuscript) The Medieval era includes music from after the fall of Rome to about 1400. Monophonic chant, also called plainsong or Gregorian chant, was the dominant form until about 1100. Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church. Polyphonic (multi-voiced) music developed from monophonic chant throughout the late Middle Ages and into the Renaissance, including the more complex voicings of motets. Johannes Ockeghem, Kyrie \\"Au travail suis\\" excerpt A number of European classical musical instruments have roots in Eastern instruments that were adopted from the medieval Islamic world. For example, the Arabic rebab is the ancestor of all European bowed string instruments, including the lira, rebec and violin. Many of the instruments used to perform medieval music still exist, but in different forms. Medieval instruments included the flute, the recorder and plucked string instruments like the lute. As well, early versions of the organ and fiddle (or vielle) existed. Medieval instruments in Europe had most commonly been used singly, often self accompanied with a drone note, or occasionally in parts. From at least as early as the 13th century through the 15th century there was a division of instruments into haut (loud, shrill, outdoor instruments) and bas (quieter, more intimate instruments). During the earlier medieval period, the vocal music from the liturgical genre, predominantly Gregorian chant, was monophonic, using a single, unaccompanied vocal melody line.Hoppin (1978) p. 57 Polyphonic vocal genres, which used multiple independent vocal melodies, began to develop during the high medieval era, becoming prevalent by the later 13th and early 14th century. Notable Medieval composers include Hildegard of Bingen, Guillaume de Machaut, L√©onin, P√©rotin, Philippe de Vitry, Francesco Landini, and Johannes Ciconia. Renaissance era The Renaissance era was from 1400 to 1600. It was characterized by greater use of instrumentation, multiple interweaving melodic lines, and the use of the first bass instruments. Social dancing became more widespread, so musical forms appropriate to accompanying dance began to standardize. It is in this time that the notation of music on a staff and other elements of musical notation began to take shape.Grout (1973), p. 61 This invention made possible the separation of the composition of a piece of music from its transmission; without written music, transmission was oral, and subject to change every time it was transmitted. With a musical score, a work of music could be performed without the composer's presence.Grout (1973), pp. 75‚Äì76 The invention of the movable-type printing press in the 15th century had far-reaching consequences on the preservation and transmission of music.Grout (1973), pp. 175‚Äì76 An illuminated opening from the Chigi codex featuring the Kyrie of Ockeghem's Missa Ecce ancilla Domini Many instruments originated during the Renaissance; others were variations of, or improvements upon, instruments that had existed previously. Some have survived to the present day; others have disappeared, only to be re-created in order to perform music on period instruments. As in the modern day, instruments may be classified as brass, strings, percussion, and woodwind. Brass instruments in the Renaissance were traditionally played by professionals who were members of Guilds and they included the slide trumpet, the wooden cornet, the valveless trumpet and the sackbut. Stringed instruments included the viol, the rebec, the harp-like lyre, the hurdy-gurdy, the lute, the guitar, the cittern, the bandora, and the orpharion. Keyboard instruments with strings included the harpsichord and the clavichord. Percussion instruments include the triangle, the Jew's harp, the tambourine, the bells, the rumble-pot, and various kinds of drums. Woodwind instruments included the double-reed shawm (an early member of the oboe family), the reed pipe, the bagpipe, the transverse flute, the recorder, the dulcian, and the crumhorn. Simple pipe organs existed, but were largely confined to churches, although there were portable varieties.Grout (1973), pp. 72‚Äì74 Printing enabled the standardization of descriptions and specifications of instruments, as well as instruction in their use.Grout (1973), pp. 222‚Äì225 Vocal music in the Renaissance is noted for the flourishing of an increasingly elaborate polyphonic style. The principal liturgical forms which endured throughout the entire Renaissance period were masses and motets, with some other developments towards the end, especially as composers of sacred music began to adopt secular forms (such as the madrigal) for their own designs. Towards the end of the period, the early dramatic precursors of opera such as monody, the madrigal comedy, and the intermedio are seen. Around 1597, Italian composer Jacopo Peri wrote Dafne, the first work to be called an opera today. He also composed Euridice, the first opera to have survived to the present day. Notable Renaissance composers include Josquin des Prez, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, John Dunstaple, Johannes Ockeghem, Orlande de Lassus, Guillaume Du Fay, Gilles Binchois, Thomas Tallis, William Byrd, Giovanni Gabrieli, Carlo Gesualdo, John Dowland, Jacob Obrecht, Adrian Willaert, Jacques Arcadelt, and Cipriano de Rore. =Common-practice period= The common practice period is typically defined as the era between the formation and the dissolution of common-practice tonality. The term usually spans roughly two-and-a-half centuries, encompassing the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods. Baroque era Baroque instruments including hurdy- gurdy, harpsichord, bass viol, lute, violin, and baroque guitar Baroque music is characterized by the use of complex tonal counterpoint and the use of a basso continuo, a continuous bass line. Music became more complex in comparison with the simple songs of all previous periods. The beginnings of the sonata form took shape in the canzona, as did a more formalized notion of theme and variations. The tonalities of major and minor as means for managing dissonance and chromaticism in music took full shape.Grout (1973), pp. 300‚Äì32 During the Baroque era, keyboard music played on the harpsichord and pipe organ became increasingly popular, and the violin family of stringed instruments took the form generally seen today. Opera as a staged musical drama began to differentiate itself from earlier musical and dramatic forms, and vocal forms like the cantata and oratorio became more common.Grout (1973), pp. 341‚Äì55 Vocalists for the first time began adding extra notes to the music. The theories surrounding equal temperament began to be put in wider practice, especially as it enabled a wider range of chromatic possibilities in hard-to- tune keyboard instruments. Although J.S. Bach did not use equal temperament, as a modern piano is generally tuned, changes in the temperaments from the meantone system, common at the time, to various temperaments that made modulation between all keys musically acceptable, made possible his Well- Tempered Clavier.Grout (1973), p. 378 Baroque instruments included some instruments from the earlier periods (e.g., the hurdy-gurdy and recorder) and a number of new instruments (e.g., the oboe, bassoon, cello, contrabass and fortepiano). Some instruments from previous eras fell into disuse, such as the shawm, cittern, rackett, and the wooden cornet. The key Baroque instruments for strings included the violin, viol, viola, viola d'amore, cello, contrabass, lute, theorbo (which often played the basso continuo parts), mandolin, Baroque guitar, harp and hurdy-gurdy. Woodwinds included the Baroque flute, Baroque oboe, recorder and the bassoon. Brass instruments included the cornett, natural horn, Baroque trumpet, serpent and the trombone. Keyboard instruments included the clavichord, the tangent piano, the harpsichord, the pipe organ, and, later in the period, the fortepiano (an early version of the piano). Percussion instruments included the timpani, snare drum, tambourine and the castanets. One major difference between Baroque music and the classical era that followed it is that the types of instruments used in Baroque ensembles were much less standardized. A Baroque ensemble could include one of several different types of keyboard instruments (e.g., pipe organ or harpsichord), additional stringed chordal instruments (e.g., a lute), bowed strings, woodwinds, and brass instruments, and an unspecified number of bass instruments performing the basso continuo,(e.g., a cello, contrabass, viola, bassoon, serpent, etc.). Vocal developments in the Baroque era included the development of opera types such as opera seria and op√©ra comique, and related forms such as oratorios and cantatas. Important composers of this era include Johann Sebastian Bach, Antonio Vivaldi, George Frideric Handel, Henry Purcell, Claudio Monteverdi, Barbara Strozzi, Domenico Scarlatti, Georg Philipp Telemann, Arcangelo Corelli, Alessandro Scarlatti, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Jean-Baptiste Lully, and Heinrich Sch√ºtz. Classical era Joseph Haydn (1732‚Äì1809) portrayed by Thomas Hardy (1791) Though the term \\"classical music\\" includes all Western art music from the Medieval era to the 2000s, the Classical Era was the period of Western art music from the 1750s to the early 1820s‚Äîthe era of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Joseph Haydn, and Ludwig van Beethoven. The Classical era established many of the norms of composition, presentation, and style, and was also when the piano became the predominant keyboard instrument. The basic forces required for an orchestra became somewhat standardized (although they would grow as the potential of a wider array of instruments was developed in the following centuries). Chamber music grew to include ensembles with as many as 8 to 10 performers for serenades. Opera continued to develop, with regional styles in Italy, France, and German- speaking lands. The opera buffa, a form of comic opera, rose in popularity. The symphony came into its own as a musical form, and the concerto was developed as a vehicle for displays of virtuoso playing skill. Orchestras no longer required a harpsichord (which had been part of the traditional continuo in the Baroque style), and were often led by the lead violinist (now called the concertmaster).Grout (1973), p. 463 Classical era musicians continued to use many of instruments from the Baroque era, such as the cello, contrabass, recorder, trombone, timpani, fortepiano (the precursor to the modern piano) and organ. While some Baroque instruments fell into disuse (e.g., the theorbo and rackett), many Baroque instruments were changed into the versions that are still in use today, such as the Baroque violin (which became the violin), the Baroque oboe (which became the oboe) and the Baroque trumpet, which transitioned to the regular valved trumpet. During the Classical era, the stringed instruments used in orchestra and chamber music such as string quartets were standardized as the four instruments which form the string section of the orchestra: the violin, viola, cello, and double bass. Baroque- era stringed instruments such as fretted, bowed viols were phased out. Woodwinds included the basset clarinet, basset horn, clarinette d'amour, the Classical clarinet, the chalumeau, the flute, oboe and bassoon. Keyboard instruments included the clavichord and the fortepiano. While the harpsichord was still used in basso continuo accompaniment in the 1750s and 1760s, it fell out of use at the end of the century. Brass instruments included the buccin, the ophicleide (a replacement for the bass serpent, which was the precursor of the tuba) and the natural horn. Wind instruments became more refined in the Classical era. While double-reed instruments like the oboe and bassoon became somewhat standardized in the Baroque, the clarinet family of single reeds was not widely used until Mozart expanded its role in orchestral, chamber, and concerto settings. Major composers of this period include Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Joseph Haydn, Christoph Willibald Gluck, Johann Christian Bach, Luigi Boccherini, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Muzio Clementi, Antonio Salieri, and Johann Nepomuk Hummel. Romantic era The music of the Romantic era, from roughly the first decade of the 19th century to the early 20th century, was characterized by increased attention to an extended melodic line, as well as expressive and emotional elements, paralleling romanticism in other art forms. Musical forms began to break from the Classical era forms (even as those were being codified), with free-form pieces like nocturnes, fantasias, and preludes being written where accepted ideas about the exposition and development of themes were ignored or minimized.Swafford, p. 200 The music became more chromatic, dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms of the older forms) about key signatures increasing.Swafford, p. 201 The art song (or Lied) came to maturity in this era, as did the epic scales of grand opera, ultimately transcended by Richard Wagner's Ring cycle.Grout (1973), pp. 595‚Äì612 In the 19th century, musical institutions emerged from the control of wealthy patrons, as composers and musicians could construct lives independent of the nobility. Increasing interest in music by the growing middle classes throughout western Europe spurred the creation of organizations for the teaching, performance, and preservation of music. The piano, which achieved its modern construction in this era (in part due to industrial advances in metallurgy) became widely popular with the middle class, whose demands for the instrument spurred many piano builders. Many symphony orchestras date their founding to this era. Some musicians and composers were the stars of the day; some, like Franz Liszt and Niccol√≤ Paganini, fulfilled both roles.Grout (1973), p. 543 European cultural ideas and institutions began to follow colonial expansion into other parts of the world. There was also a rise, especially toward the end of the era, of nationalism in music (echoing, in some cases, political sentiments of the time), as composers such as Edvard Grieg, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k echoed traditional music of their homelands in their compositions.Grout (1973), pp. 634, 641‚Äì42 Dublin Philharmonic Orchestra In the Romantic era, the modern piano, with a more powerful, sustained tone and a wider range took over from the more delicate- sounding fortepiano. In the orchestra, the existing Classical instruments and sections were retained (string section, woodwinds, brass, and percussion), but these sections were typically expanded to make a fuller, bigger sound. For example, while a Baroque orchestra may have had two double bass players, a Romantic orchestra could have as many as ten. \\"As music grew more expressive, the standard orchestral palette just wasn't rich enough for many Romantic composers.\\" The families of instruments used, especially in orchestras, grew larger; a process that climaxed in the early 20th century with very large orchestras used by late romantic and modernist composers. A wider array of percussion instruments began to appear. Brass instruments took on larger roles, as the introduction of rotary valves made it possible for them to play a wider range of notes. The size of the orchestra (typically around 40 in the Classical era) grew to be over 100. Gustav Mahler's 1906 Symphony No. 8, for example, has been performed with over 150 instrumentalists and choirs of over 400. New woodwind instruments were added, such as the contrabassoon, bass clarinet and piccolo and new percussion instruments were added, including xylophones, snare drums, celestas (a bell-like keyboard instrument), bells, and triangles, large orchestral harps, and even wind machines for sound effects. Saxophones appear in some scores from the late 19th century onwards, usually featured as a solo instrument rather than as in integral part of the orchestra. The Wagner tuba, a modified member of the horn family, appears in Richard Wagner's cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen. It also has a prominent role in Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 7 in E Major and is also used in several late romantic and modernist works by Richard Strauss, B√©la Bart√≥k, and others Cornets appear regularly in 19th century scores, alongside trumpets which were regarded as less agile, at least until the end of the century. Prominent composers of this era include Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, Hector Berlioz, Franz Schubert, Robert Schumann, Felix Mendelssohn, Franz Liszt, Giuseppe Verdi, Richard Wagner, Johannes Brahms, Edvard Grieg, and Johann Strauss II. Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss are commonly regarded as transitional composers whose music combines both late romantic and early modernist elements. =20th and 21st centuries= Modernist era Igor Stravinsky, by Pablo Picasso, collaborators on Pulcinella (1920) Encompassing a wide variety of post-Romantic styles, modernist classical music includes late romantic, impressionist, expressionist, and neoclassical styles of composition. Modernism marked an era when many composers rejected certain values of the common practice period, such as traditional tonality, melody, instrumentation, and structure. Some music historians regard musical modernism as an era extending from about 1890 to 1930.; Others consider that modernism ended with one or the other of the two world wars. Still other authorities claim that modernism is not associated with any historical era, but rather is \\"an attitude of the composer; a living construct that can evolve with the times\\". Despite its decline in the last third of the 20th century, there remained at the end of the century an active core of composers who continued to advance the ideas and forms of modernism, such as Pierre Boulez, Pauline Oliveros, Toru Takemitsu, George Benjamin, Jacob Druckman, Brian Ferneyhough, George Perle, Wolfgang Rihm, Richard Wernick, Richard Wilson, and Ralph Shapey. Two musical movements that were dominant during this time were the impressionist beginning around 1890 and the expressionist that started around 1908. It was a period of diverse reactions in challenging and reinterpreting older categories of music, innovations that lead to new ways of organizing and approaching harmonic, melodic, sonic, and rhythmic aspects of music, and changes in aesthetic worldviews in close relation to the larger identifiable period of modernism in the arts of the time. The operative word most associated with it is \\"innovation\\". Its leading feature is a \\"linguistic plurality\\", which is to say that no single music genre ever assumed a dominant position. The orchestra continued to grow in size during the early years modernist era, peaking in the first two decades of the 20th century. Saxophones that appeared only rarely during the 19th century became more commonly used as supplementary instruments, but never became core members of the orchestra. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example Maurice Ravel's orchestration of Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition and Sergei Rachmaninoff's Symphonic Dances, the saxophone is included in other works such as Sergei Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2 and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. In some compositions such as Ravel's Bol√©ro, two or more saxophones of different sizes are used to create an entire section like the other sections of the orchestra. The euphonium is featured in a few late Romantic and 20th century works, usually playing parts marked \\"tenor tuba\\", including Gustav Holst's The Planets, and Richard Strauss's Ein Heldenleben. Prominent composers of the early 20th century include Igor Stravinsky, Claude Debussy, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Sergei Prokofiev, Arnold Schoenberg, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Anton Webern, Alban Berg, C√©cile Chaminade, Paul Hindemith, Aram Khachaturian, George Gershwin, Amy Beach, B√©la Bart√≥k, and Dmitri Shostakovich, along with the aforementioned Mahler and Strauss as transitional figures who carried over from the 19th century. Post-modern/contemporary era Postmodern music is a period of music that began as early as 1930 according to some authorities. It shares characteristics with postmodernist art ‚Äì that is, art that comes after and reacts against modernism. Some other authorities have more or less equated postmodern music with the \\"contemporary music\\" composed well after 1930, from the late 20th century through to the early 21st century. Some of the diverse movements of the postmodern/contemporary era include the neoromantic, neomedieval, minimalist, and post minimalist. Contemporary classical music at the beginning of the 21st century was often considered to include all post-1945 musical forms.\\"Contemporary\\" in A generation later, this term now properly refers to the music of today written by composers who are still alive; music that came into prominence in the mid-1970s. It includes different variations of modernist, postmodern, neoromantic, and pluralist music.Leon Botstein, \\"Modernism\\", ¬ß9: The Late 20th Century, Grove Music (subscription access).

Musicologist Marcia Citron has asked \\"[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?\\". Citron \\"examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received 'canon' of performed musical works\\". She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote art songs for performance in small recitals rather than symphonies intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed not to be notable as composers. In the \\"...Concise Oxford History of Music, Clara S[c]humann is one of the only female composers mentioned.\\" Abbey Philips states that \\"[d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing/playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts.\\" Historically, major professional orchestras have been mostly or entirely composed of musicians who are men. Some of the earliest cases of women being hired in professional orchestras was in the position of harpist. The Vienna Philharmonic, for example, did not accept women to permanent membership until 1997, far later than the other orchestras ranked among the world's top five by Gramophone in 2008. The last major orchestra to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the Berlin Philharmonic.James R. Oestreich, \\"Berlin in Lights: The Woman Question\\", Arts Beat, The New York Times, November 16, 2007 As late as February 1996, the Vienna Philharmonic's principal flute, Dieter Flury, told Westdeutscher Rundfunk that accepting women would be \\"gambling with the emotional unity () that this organism currently has\\".Westdeutscher Rundfunk Radio 5, \\"Musikalische Misogynie\\", February 13, 1996, transcribed by Regina Himmelbauer ; translation by William Osborne In April 1996, the orchestra's press secretary wrote that \\"compensating for the expected leaves of absence\\" of maternity leave would be a problem. In 1997, the Vienna Philharmonic was \\"facing protests during a [US] tour\\" by the National Organization for Women and the International Alliance for Women in Music. Finally, \\"after being held up to increasing ridicule even in socially conservative Austria, members of the orchestra gathered [on 28 February 1997] in an extraordinary meeting on the eve of their departure and agreed to admit a woman, Anna Lelkes, as harpist.\\"Jane Perlez, \\"Vienna Philharmonic Lets Women Join in Harmony\\", The New York Times, February 28, 1997 As of 2013, the orchestra has six female members; one of them, violinist Albena Danailova became one of the orchestra's concertmasters in 2008, the first woman to hold that position. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the orchestra's membership. VPO president Clemens Hellsberg said the VPO now uses completely screened blind auditions.James R. Oestreich, \\"Even Legends Adjust To Time and Trend, Even the Vienna Philharmonic\\", The New York Times, February 28, 1998 In 2013, an article in Mother Jones stated that while \\"[m]any prestigious orchestras have significant female membership‚Äîwomen outnumber men in the New York Philharmonic's violin section‚Äîand several renowned ensembles, including the National Symphony Orchestra, the Detroit Symphony, and the Minnesota Symphony, are led by women violinists,\\" the double bass, brass, and percussion sections of major orchestras \\"...are still predominantly male\\". A 2014 BBC article stated that the \\"...introduction of 'blind' auditions, where a prospective instrumentalist performs behind a screen so that the judging panel can exercise no gender or racial prejudice, has seen the gender balance of traditionally male-dominated symphony orchestras gradually shift.\\" Relationship to other music traditions =Popular music= Classical music has often incorporated elements or material from popular music of the composer's time. Examples include occasional music such as Brahms' use of student drinking songs in his Academic Festival Overture, genres exemplified by Kurt Weill's The Threepenny Opera, and the influence of jazz on early and mid-20th-century composers including Maurice Ravel, exemplified by the movement entitled \\"Blues\\" in his sonata for violin and piano. Some postmodern, minimalist and postminimalist classical composers acknowledge a debt to popular music.See, for example, Numerous examples show influence in the opposite direction, including popular songs based on classical music, the use to which Pachelbel's Canon has been put since the 1970s, and the musical crossover phenomenon, where classical musicians have achieved success in the popular music arena.Notable examples are the Hooked on Classics series of recordings made by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in the early 1980s and the classical crossover violinists Vanessa Mae and Catya Mar√©. In heavy metal, a number of lead guitarists (playing electric guitar), including Ritchie Blackmore and Randy Rhoads, modeled their playing styles on Baroque or Classical-era instrumental music. =Folk music= Composers of classical music have often made use of folk music (music created by musicians who are commonly not classically trained, often from a purely oral tradition). Some composers, like Dvo≈ô√°k and Smetana, have used folk themes to impart a nationalist flavor to their work, while others like Bart√≥k have used specific themes lifted whole from their folk-music origins. Commercialization Certain staples of classical music are often used commercially (either in advertising or in movie soundtracks). In television commercials, several passages have become clich√©d, particularly the opening of Richard Strauss' Also sprach Zarathustra (made famous in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey) and the opening section \\"O Fortuna\\" of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana; other examples include the \\"Dies irae\\" from the Verdi Requiem, Edvard Grieg's \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\" from Peer Gynt, the opening bars of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5, Wagner's \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\" from Die Walk√ºre, Rimsky-Korsakov's \\"Flight of the Bumblebee\\", and excerpts of Aaron Copland's Rodeo. Several works from the Golden Age of Animation matched the action to classical music. Notable examples are Walt Disney's Fantasia, Tom and Jerry's Johann Mouse, and Warner Bros.' Rabbit of Seville and What's Opera, Doc? Similarly, movies and television often revert to standard, clich√©d excerpts of classical music to convey refinement or opulence: some of the most-often heard pieces in this category include Bach¬¥s Cello Suite No. 1, Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik, Vivaldi's Four Seasons, Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain (as orchestrated by Rimsky-Korsakov), and Rossini's \\"William Tell Overture\\". Shawn Vancour argues that the commercialization of classical music in the early 20th century may have harmed the music industry through inadequate representation. Education During the 1990s, several research papers and popular books wrote on what came to be called the \\"Mozart effect\\": an observed temporary, small elevation of scores on certain tests as a result of listening to Mozart's works. The approach has been popularized in a book by Don Campbell, and is based on an experiment published in Nature suggesting that listening to Mozart temporarily boosted students' IQ by 8 to 9 points. This popularized version of the theory was expressed succinctly by the New York Times music columnist Alex Ross: \\"researchers... have determined that listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter.\\"Ross, Alex. \\"Classical View; Listening To Prozac... Er, Mozart\\", The New York Times, August 28, 1994. Retrieved on May 16, 2008. Promoters marketed CDs claimed to induce the effect. Florida passed a law requiring toddlers in state-run schools to listen to classical music every day, and in 1998 the governor of Georgia budgeted $105,000 per year to provide every child born in Georgia with a tape or CD of classical music. One of the co-authors of the original studies of the Mozart effect commented \\"I don't think it can hurt. I'm all for exposing children to wonderful cultural experiences. But I do think the money could be better spent on music education programs.\\"Goode, Erica. \\"Mozart for Baby? Some Say, Maybe Not\\", The New York Times, August 3, 1999. Retrieved on May 16, 2008. This study is reflective of several recent studies (i.e. Mike Manthei and Steve N. Kelly of the University of Nebraska at Omaha; Donald A. Hodges and Debra S. O'Connell, review of several studies in this field. of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro) and others.

Alexo is a ghost town in Alberta, Canada. Built as a coal mining town, it lies in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies at an elevation of about , near the David Thompson Highway between the towns of Nordegg and Rocky Mountain House. Shunda Creek and the North Saskatchewan River run to the south of it. History Access to the Alexo area was poor prior to 1913 when the Brazeau Branch rail line (part of the Canadian Northern Railway which later became part of the Canadian National Railway) to the coal mine at Nordegg was opened. This created access to coal markets, and other mining ventures soon started near the tracks. The mine at Alexo, which was named after the Alexo Coal Company, was one of them, as were the mines at Saunders Creek and Harlech. The Alexo mine began operation in 1920, and by 1948 annual production was about 33,000 tonnes. The payroll included about 70 people, of whom 30 were miners. There was a hotel, a cookhouse, a bunkhouse, a store, and 30 cottages.Pullen, P.F. and Tennant, R. 1948. Alexo has quality products. Western Miner, vol. 21, no. 8, p. 88-89, August 1948.

Its elevation is . Originally named Pine Creek, Amber Valley was among several Alberta communities settled in the early 20th century by early black immigrants to the province from Oklahoma and the Deep South of the United States. About 1,000 African Americans emigrated to Alberta from 1909-1911. Amber Valley is the location of the Obadiah Place provincial heritage site, a homestead of one of the first African-American settler families.  History  In 1909, a group of 160 African-American homesteaders established the community. The homesteaders, African Americans from Oklahoma and Texas, were attracted by the government's promises of land to homestead, as it was trying to encourage immigrant settlers to develop the land. They were leaving Jim Crow conditions in the United States that discriminated against their rights. Parson Harrison Sneed, a clergyman and mason, led a group of settlers from Oklahoma to an area by the Athabasca River. For the first few years they had difficulties, as the climate was harsher than what they were used to in Oklahoma. They had both to clear and cultivate land for crops, and build their houses from the ground up. Most of the early ones were log cabins. The settlers were resilient and three quarters of the African Americans stayed on their land in Alberta long enough and developed it in order to secure their homestead patents, a higher percentage than of some other settlers groups. They built a school house in 1913 and a nondenominational church in 1914. They developed a baseball team that was widely known in the north. Amber Valley was the largest community of black people in Alberta until the 1930s. It received a post office in 1931, when it officially established the name of the community. At that time the community had about 300 people, and supported a two-room schoolhouse. Because of a decline in population as people moved to cities and areas with more economic opportunity, the post office was closed in 1968. Other primarily American black settlements formed at this time were Junkins (now Wildwood), near Chip Lake; Keystone (now Breton), southwest of Edmonton; Campsie, near Barrhead; and Eldon, near Maidstone, Saskatchewan. From 1908 to 1911, about 1,000 African Americans settled in Alberta to homestead.\\"Black Settlers Come to Alberta\\", Alberta Settlement Beginning in the 1950s, many descendants of the original settlers began moving to near cities such as Edmonton to escape the rigors of rural life and have more economic opportunity. In Edmonton, Amber Valley descendants founded the Shiloh Baptist Church, one of the few black churches in Western Canada. Amber Valley is now considered a ghost town. Original settlers Willis Reese Bowen (also known as Willace Bowen) organized the original group of five families who moved from Oklahoma to Vancouver, and then to Amber Valley. Willace Bowen established a homestead that his son Obadiah Bowen continued to work. Obadiah replaced the first house with a brick one in 1938. The house and homestead, with outbuildings, has been preserved as Obadiah Place and honored for its historic provincial significance. * John King and Stella King, parents of Violet King Henry, the first Canadian black female attorney * Willace Bowen, also recorded as Willis Reese Bowen * Parson Harrison Sneed * Hazel Proctor * J.D.

Etymology  The name Teith is obscure, but may come from the Scottish Gaelic Uisge Theamhich, which translates into English as the \\"quiet and pleasant water\\".MacKay, Moray S.(1953). Doune Historical Notes, p. 104. Forth Naturalist and Historian Board . The place-name Callander may conserve an older name for the Teith, derived from Brittonic *caleto-dubro, meaning \\"hard- water\\".  Course  The Teith is formed from the confluence of two smaller rivers: one from Loch Venachar, the Eas Gobhain which translates as \\"the smith's cascade\\", and one from Loch Lubnaig - Garbh Uisge which translates as \\"the rough water\\". The river flows through Callander and is joined by the Keltie Water south of Keltie Bridge. The Teith continues to Deanston and Doune where the Ardoch Burn meets it, before its confluence with the (smaller) Forth upstream of Stirling.  Importance  The Teith is renowned for its fishing and for the splendid arched bridge southwest of Doune. Confluence of Ardoch with Teith, 3 km downstream from Doune The Deanston Distillery near Doune uses the Teith to supply water for the manufacture of Deanston Single Malt Whisky. The 'Brig o' Teith' was constructed in 1535 by Robert Spittal, a Royal tailor to Mary Queen of Scots. According to Charles Roger in 'A Week at Bridge of Allan 1851', a ferryman refused Spittal passage across the Teith as he did not have his purse and could not pay. The bridge was built in retaliation.
