It has the property that any G principal bundle over a paracompact manifold is isomorphic to a pullback of the principal bundle EG ‚Üí BG., Theorem 2 As explained later, this means that classifying spaces represent a set-valued functor on the homotopy category of topological spaces. The term classifying space can also be used for spaces that represent a set- valued functor on the category of topological spaces, such as Sierpi≈Ñski space. This notion is generalized by the notion of classifying topos. However, the rest of this article discusses the more commonly used notion of classifying space up to homotopy. For a discrete group G, BG is, roughly speaking, a path-connected topological space X such that the fundamental group of X is isomorphic to G and the higher homotopy groups of X are trivial, that is, BG is an Eilenberg‚ÄìMacLane space, or a K(G,1). Motivation An example of a classifying space for the infinite cyclic group G is the circle as X. When G is a discrete group, another way to specify the condition on X is that the universal cover Y of X is contractible. In that case the projection map :\\\\pi: Y\\\\longrightarrow X\\\\ becomes a fiber bundle with structure group G, in fact a principal bundle for G. The interest in the classifying space concept really arises from the fact that in this case Y has a universal property with respect to principal G-bundles, in the homotopy category. This is actually more basic than the condition that the higher homotopy groups vanish: the fundamental idea is, given G, to find such a contractible space Y on which G acts freely. (The weak equivalence idea of homotopy theory relates the two versions.) In the case of the circle example, what is being said is that we remark that an infinite cyclic group C acts freely on the real line R, which is contractible. Taking X as the quotient space circle, we can regard the projection œÄ from R = Y to X as a helix in geometrical terms, undergoing projection from three dimensions to the plane. What is being claimed is that œÄ has a universal property amongst principal C-bundles; that any principal C-bundle in a definite way 'comes from' œÄ. Formalism A more formal statement takes into account that G may be a topological group (not simply a discrete group), and that group actions of G are taken to be continuous; in the absence of continuous actions the classifying space concept can be dealt with, in homotopy terms, via the Eilenberg‚ÄìMacLane space construction. In homotopy theory the definition of a topological space BG, the classifying space for principal G-bundles, is given, together with the space EG which is the total space of the universal bundle over BG. That is, what is provided is in fact a continuous mapping :\\\\pi: EG\\\\longrightarrow BG.\\\\ Assume that the homotopy category of CW complexes is the underlying category, from now on. The classifying property required of BG in fact relates to œÄ. We must be able to say that given any principal G-bundle :\\\\gamma: Y\\\\longrightarrow Z\\\\ over a space Z, there is a classifying map œÜ from Z to BG, such that Œ≥ is the pullback of œÄ along œÜ. In less abstract terms, the construction of Œ≥ by 'twisting' should be reducible via œÜ to the twisting already expressed by the construction of œÄ. For this to be a useful concept, there evidently must be some reason to believe such spaces BG exist. In abstract terms (which are not those originally used around 1950 when the idea was first introduced) this is a question of whether the contravariant functor from the homotopy category to the category of sets, defined by :h(Z) = set of isomorphism classes of principal G-bundles on Z is a representable functor. The abstract conditions being known for this (Brown's representability theorem) ensure that the result, as an existence theorem, is affirmative and not too difficult. Examples #The circle is a classifying space for the infinite cyclic group \\\\Z. The total space is E\\\\Z =\\\\R. #The n-torus \\\\mathbb T^n is a classifying space for \\\\Z^n, the free abelian group of rank n. The total space is E\\\\Z^n=\\\\R^n. #The wedge of n circles is a classifying space for the free group of rank n. #A closed (that is compact and without boundary) connected surface S of genus at least 1 is a classifying space for its fundamental group \\\\pi_1(S). #A closed (that is compact and without boundary) connected hyperbolic manifold M is a classifying space for its fundamental group \\\\pi_1(M). #A finite locally connected CAT(0) cubical complex is a classifying space of its fundamental group. #The infinite-dimensional projective space \\\\mathbb{RP}^\\\\infty is a classifying space for the cyclic group \\\\Z_2 = \\\\Z /2\\\\Z. The total space is E\\\\Z_2 = S^\\\\infty (this is the direct limit of spheres S^n, equivalently, Hilbert space with the origin removed; it is contractible). #The space B\\\\Z_n = S^\\\\infty / \\\\Z_n is the classifying space for the cyclic group \\\\Z_n. Here, S^\\\\infty is understood to be a certain subset of the infinite dimensional Hilbert space \\\\Complex^\\\\infty with the origin removed; the cyclic group is considered to act on it by multiplication with roots of unity. #The unordered configuration space \\\\operatorname{UConf}_n(\\\\R^2) is the classifying space of the Artin braid group B_n, and the ordered configuration space \\\\operatorname{Conf}_n(\\\\R^2) is the classifying space for the pure Artin braid group P_n. #The (unordered) configuration space \\\\operatorname{UConf}_n(\\\\R^\\\\infty) is a classifying space for the symmetric group S_n. #The infinite dimensional complex projective space \\\\mathbb{CP}^\\\\infty is the classifying space for the circle thought of as a compact topological group. #The Grassmannian Gr(n, \\\\R^\\\\infty) of n-planes in \\\\R^\\\\infty is the classifying space of the orthogonal group . The total space is EO(n) = V(n, \\\\R^\\\\infty), the Stiefel manifold of n-dimensional orthonormal frames in \\\\R^\\\\infty. Applications This still leaves the question of doing effective calculations with BG; for example, the theory of characteristic classes is essentially the same as computing the cohomology groups of BG, at least within the restrictive terms of homotopy theory, for interesting groups G such as Lie groups (H. Cartan's theorem). As was shown by the Bott periodicity theorem, the homotopy groups of BG are also of fundamental interest. The early work on classifying spaces introduced constructions (for example, the bar construction), that gave concrete descriptions as a simplicial complex. An example of a classifying space is that when G is cyclic of order two; then BG is real projective space of infinite dimension, corresponding to the observation that EG can be taken as the contractible space resulting from removing the origin in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, with G acting via v going to ‚àív, and allowing for homotopy equivalence in choosing BG. This example shows that classifying spaces may be complicated. In relation with differential geometry (Chern‚ÄìWeil theory) and the theory of Grassmannians, a much more hands-on approach to the theory is possible for cases such as the unitary groups that are of greatest interest. The construction of the Thom complex MG showed that the spaces BG were also implicated in cobordism theory, so that they assumed a central place in geometric considerations coming out of algebraic topology. Since group cohomology can (in many cases) be defined by the use of classifying spaces, they can also be seen as foundational in much homological algebra. Generalizations include those for classifying foliations, and the classifying toposes for logical theories of the predicate calculus in intuitionistic logic that take the place of a 'space of models'.

Biography Waller was born in Joinerville, Texas and moved to Lake Charles, Louisiana at the age of 2 with his family. He began to play guitar at the age of 10 and moved with his mother to Baltimore, Maryland. In 1952, Waller joined Earl Taylor's bluegrass band, the Stoney Mountain Boys. He returned to Louisiana in 1956 as a guitar player with Buzz Busby and the Bayou Boys, making appearances on television. In 1957 he and Busby returned to the Washington, D.C. area, where Waller met mandolinist John Duffey and banjo player Bill Emerson. When Busby was injured in an auto accident in July 1957, Emerson formed a temporary band with Waller and Duffey to fulfill Busby's bookings. The temporary band soon became permanent, and The Country Gentlemen would continue for more than fifty years. The Country Gentlemen achieved fame across the United States and internationally. While more than 100 musicians have been members at one time, Waller was an original member of the group and has many famous songs to his credit. The band released a new album, Songs of the American Spirit, in September 2004. On August 18, 2004 Charlie Waller suffered a massive heart attack at his Gordonsville, Virginia home.

The book's origin and the meaning of the text and illustrations have been investigated by many scholars and amateurs, with no definitive conclusion, although many Hungarian scholars believe that it is an 18th-century hoax. The name of the codex is often spelled Rohonczi, according to the old Hungarian orthography that was reformed in the first half of the 19th century. This spelling has spread probably due to the book of V. EnƒÉchiuc (see Bibliography below). Today the name of the codex is written in Hungarian as Rohonci k√≥dex. History The codex was named after the city of Rohonc, in Western Hungary (now Rechnitz, Austria), where it was kept until 1838, when it was donated to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences by Guszt√°v Batthy√°ny, a Hungarian count, together with his entire library. The origin of the codex is unknown. A possible trace of its past may be an entry in the 1743 catalogue of the Batthy√°nys' Rohonc library, which says \\"Magyar im√°ds√°gok, volumen I. in 12.\\", (Hungarian prayers in one volume, size duodecimo). The size and the assumable content agree with those of the codex, but this is all of the information given in the catalogue, so it may only be a hint.See Jerney 1844 and N√©m√§ti 1892. Since its existence became widely known, the codex has been studied by many scholars and amateurs, but none has succeeded in providing a widely accepted convincing translation or interpretation of the text. It was studied by the Hungarian scholar Ferenc Toldy around 1840, and later by P√°l Hunfalvy and by the Austrian paleography expert Albert Mahl.See N√©m√§ti 1892, p. 17. Josef Jireƒçek and his son, Konstantin Josef Jireƒçek, both university professors in Prague, studied 32 pages of the codex in 1884‚Äì1885. In 1885 the codex was sent to Bernhard J√ºlg, a professor at Innsbruck University. Mih√°ly Munk√°csy, the celebrated Hungarian painter, took the codex with him to Paris in the years 1890‚Äì1892 to study it.See N√©m√§ti 1892, p. 17‚Äì18. In 1866, Hungarian historian K√°roly Szab√≥ (1824‚Äì1890) proposed that the codex was a hoax by S√°muel Liter√°ti Nemes (1796‚Äì1842), a Transylvanian-Hungarian antiquarian, and co-founder of the National Sz√©ch√©nyi Library in Budapest. He is known to have created many historical forgeries (mostly made in the 1830s) which deceived even some of the most renowned Hungarian scholars of the time.See Szab√≥ 1866. Since then, this opinion has been maintained by mainstream Hungarian scholarship, even though there is no evidence connecting the codex to S√°muel specifically.See e.g. Fej√©rpataky 1878, Pint√©r 1930, or Kelecs√©nyi 1988 (chapter 23: The forgeries and S√°muel Liter√°ti Nemes).

Besides the text, there are 87 illustrations that include religious, laic, and military scenes. The crude illustrations seem to indicate an environment where Christian, pagan, and Muslim religions coexist, as the symbols of the cross, crescent, and sun/swastika are all present. The number of symbols used in the codex is about ten times higher than any known alphabet (N√©m√§ti counted 792See N√©m√§ti 1889.), but most symbols are used rarely, so the symbols in the codex might not be an alphabet, but a syllabary, or logographs like Chinese characters. The justification of the right margin would seem to imply the symbols were written from right to left.See Jerney 1844. Study of the paper on which the codex is written shows that it is most probably a Venetian paper made in the 1530s.See Jerney 1844 and N√©m√§ti 1892, and their minor corrections by L√°ng 2011. This does not provide certainty as to the date of the text, however, since it may have been transcribed from an earlier source, or the paper could have been used long after it was produced.According to Joe Nickell the pages were written not long after the production of the paper, see L√°ng 2011, p. 53. Language and script Concerning the language of the codex, although Hungarian, Dacian, early Romanian or Cuman, and even Hindi have been proposed, none of the hypotheses have been backed with scientific proof so far. Those who claim the codex's Hungarian authenticity either assume that it is a paleo-Hungarian script,See N√©m√§ti 1892. or try to find resemblances to the Old Hungarian script, that is Hungarian (Sz√©kely) runes (\\"rov√°s√≠r√°s\\"). According to others, in the Dobruja region in Romania similar characters or symbols are engraved in Scythian monk caves. Still others tried to find resemblance to the letters of the Greek charter of the Veszpr√©mv√∂lgy Nunnery (Hungary). Another claims it to be a version of the Brahmi script.See Singh‚ÄìB√°rdi 2004. =Sumero-Hungarian hypothesis= Attila Ny√≠ri of Hungary proposed a solution in 1996 after studying two pages of the codex.Ny√≠ri 1996 He turned the pages upside down, identified a Sumerian ligature, and then associated Latin letters to the rest of the symbols by resemblance. However, he sometimes transliterated the same symbol with different letters, and conversely, the same letter was decoded from several symbols. Even then he had to rearrange the order of the letters to produce meaningful words. The text, if taken as meaningful, is of religious, perhaps liturgical character. Its beginning, according to Ny√≠ri, reads: Elj√∂tt az Istened. Sz√°ll az √ör. √ì. Vannak a szent angyalok. Azok. √ì. ‚Äì \\"Your God has come. The Lord flies. Oh. There are the holy angels. Them. Oh.\\" Ny√≠ri's proposition was immediately criticised by Ott√≥ Gy√ºrk, pointing to the fact that with such a permissive deciphering method one can get anything out of the code.See Gy√ºrk 1996. Also, the mere fact that Ny√≠ri makes an uncritical allusion to the fringe theory that the Hungarian language descended from Sumerian, discredits his enterprise. =Daco-Romanian hypothesis= The cover of V. EnƒÉchiuc's book A proposed translation was published in 2002 by Romanian philologist Viorica EnƒÉchiuc.See EnƒÉchiuc 2002. She claims that the text is written in the Vulgar Latin dialect of Dacia, and the direction of writing is right-to-left, bottom-to-top. The alleged translation indicates that the text is an 11-12th century (CE) history of the Blaki (Vlachs) people in their fights against Hungarians and Pechenegs. Toponyms and hydronyms appear as Arad, Dridu, Olbia, Ineu, RarƒÉu, Dniester and Tisa. Diplomatic contacts between Vlad and Alexis Comnenus, Constantine Dukas and Robert of Flanders are also mentioned. Quotations from EnƒÉchiuc's translation: Solrgco zicjra naprzi olto co sesvil cas ‚Äì \\"O Sun of the live let write what span the time\\"EnƒÉchiuc 2002, p. 224. Deteti lis vivit neglivlu iti iti itia niteren titius suonares imi urast ucen ‚Äì \\"In great numbers, in the fierce battle, without fear go, go as a hero. Break ahead with great noise, to sweep away and defeat the Hungarian!\\"EnƒÉchiuc 2002, p. 22. On the one hand, EnƒÉchiuc's proposition can be criticized for the method of transliteration. Symbols that characteristically appear in the same context throughout the codex are regularly transliterated with different letters, so that the patterns in the original code are lost in the transliteration. On the other hand, EnƒÉchiuc is criticized as a linguist and historian. She provided the only linguistic source of a hitherto unknown state of the Romanian language, and her text (even with her glossary) raises such serious doubts both in its linguistic and historic authenticity that they render her work unscientific.See e.g. L√°ng 2011, p. 40‚Äì43., Ungureanu 2003. There is no relation between the illustrations of the manuscript (of clear Christian content) and EnƒÉchiuc's translation. =Brahmi-Hindi hypothesis= Another alleged solution was made in 2004 by the Indian Mahesh Kumar Singh.Singh‚ÄìB√°rdi 2004, pp. 12‚Äì40. He claims that the codex is written left-to-right, top-to-bottom with a so far undocumented variant of the Brahmi script. He transliterated the first 24 pages of the codex to get a Hindi text which was translated to Hungarian. His solution is mostly like the beginning of an apocryphal gospel (previously unknown), with a meditative prologue, then going on to the infancy narrative of Jesus. According to Mahesh Kumar Singh, the upper two rows of page 1 read: he bhagwan log bahoot garib yahan bimar aur bhookhe hai / inko itni sakti aur himmat do taki ye apne karmo ko pura kar sakeSingh‚ÄìB√°rdi 2004, p. 13. ‚Äì \\"Oh, my God! Here the people is very poor, ill and starving, therefore give them sufficient potency and power that they may satisfy their needs.\\" Singh's attempt was immediately criticized in the next issue of the same journal.See G√©za Varga 2005 and Csaba Varga 2005. His transliteration lacks consistency, and is dismissed by many.See L√°ng 2011, pp. 44‚Äì46. =Old Hungarian Alphabet hypothesis= Marius-Adrian Oancea considers that the codex focuses on New Testament-related topics; according to him, the language of the codex is Hungarian and the words are encoded in a version of the Old Hungarian alphabet, also known as sz√©kely rov√°s√≠r√°s or sz√©kely-magyar rov√°s. =Systematic attempts= Strictly methodical (and successful) investigation of the symbols was first done in 1970 by Ott√≥ Gy√ºrk, who examined repeated sequences to find the direction of writing (he argues for RLTB (Right to Left, Top to Bottom), with pages also ordered right-to-left), and identified numbers in the text.Gy√ºrk 1970. His later remarks suggest that he also has many unpublished conjectures, based on a large amount of statistical data. Mikl√≥s Locsm√°ndi did some computer-based research on the text in the mid-1990s. He confirmed the published findings of Gy√ºrk, adding several others. Although with no strong arguments, he claimed the symbol \\"i\\" to be a sentence delimiter (but also the symbol of 11 (eleven), and possibly also a place value delimiter in numbers). He studied the diacritics of the symbols (mostly dots), but found no peculiar system in their usage. As he could see no traces of case endings (which are typically characteristic to the Hungarian language), he assumed that the text was probably in a language different from Hungarian. He could not prove that the codex is not a hoax; however, seeing the regularities of the text, he rejected that it be pure gibberish.Locsm√°ndi 2004. After 2000, research around the codex has become more intense. Benedek L√°ng summarized the previous attempts and the possible research directions in a 2010 articleL√°ng 2010. and in a 2011 book sized monograph.L√°ng 2011. He argued that the codex is not a hoax (as opposed to mainstream Hungarian academic opinion), but instead is a consciously encoded or enciphered text. It may be (1) a cipher, (2) a shorthand system, or (3) an artificial language. L√°ng assessed these possibilities systematically in his publications with the help of historical analogies. In 2010 G√°bor Tokai published a series of three short articles in the Hungarian popular science weekly, √âlet √©s Tudom√°ny. Tokai tries to date the codex by finding historical analogies of the imagery of the drawings. Although he brings up numerous valuable observations, his conclusions are somewhat vague. Nevertheless, his research was the first of its kind. Tokai could not rule out the possibility of a hoax, but he (like Locsm√°ndi) insisted that whatever be the case, the text has regularities that strongly suggest a meaning.Tokai 2010. Several months later Tokai also published two similarly short articles in which he started to give meaning to specific code chunks. He based his arguments mainly on character strings that appear in pictures (such as the INRI inscription on the cross). He claimed to have identified the codes of the four evangelists in biblical references, built up of an evangelist's name and a number, possibly some kind of chapter number. Based on Gy√ºrk's and Locsm√°ndi's work he also showed that many of the four digit numbers in the text are year numbers, using presumably a peculiar Anno Mundi epoch.Tokai 2010‚Äì2011. Simultaneous with, and independently from Tokai, Levente Zolt√°n Kir√°ly made significant progress in describing some structural elements of the code. In 2011 he demonstrated a method for cutting down the text into sentences with a good probability. He identified a 7 page section split by numbered headings, with the whole section preceded by its table of contents. Like Tokai, Kir√°ly also discovered the codes of the four evangelists, and in addition he provided a persuasive argument for a \\"chapter heading system\\" in the codex that contains biblical references. He also dealt with the overall structure of the codex, showing that the chapter structure is not present in the first fourth of the book, partly because that part contains the long, continuous narration of the passion of Jesus Christ.See Kir√°ly 2011. According to Tokai and Kir√°ly, the script is a code system that does not indicate the inner structure of words, and the language of the text is most probably artificial, as optionally proposed by Benedek L√°ng. They claim that the codex contains the date 1593 CE as a probable reference to its writing. They also state that by character it is an ordinary Catholic reader or breviary of the time, mostly containing paraphrases of New Testament texts (primarily from the Gospels), but also some non-Biblical material, like e.g. Seth returning to the gate of Paradise, or prayers to the Virgin Mary. In 2018, Tokai and Kir√°ly reported further progress in their work.

Craniometry is measurement of the cranium (the main part of the skull), usually the human cranium. It is a subset of cephalometry, measurement of the head, which in humans is a subset of anthropometry, measurement of the human body. It is distinct from phrenology, the pseudoscience that tried to link personality and character to head shape, and physiognomy, which tried the same for facial features. However, these fields have all claimed the ability to predict traits or intelligence. They were once intensively practised in anthropology, in particular in physical anthropology in the 19th and the first part of the 20th century. Theories attempting to scientifically justify the segregation of society based on race became popular at this time, one of their prominent figures being Georges Vacher de Lapouge (1854‚Äì1936), who divided humanity into various, hierarchized, different \\"races\\", spanning from the \\"Aryan white race, dolichocephalic\\" (from the Ancient Greek kephal√™, head, and dolikhos, long and thin), to the \\"brachycephalic\\" (short and broad-headed) race. On the other hand, craniometry was also used as evidence against the existence of a \\"Nordic race\\" and also by Franz Boas who used the cephalic index to show the influence of environmental factors. Charles Darwin used craniometry and the study of skeletons to demonstrate his theory of evolution first expressed in On the Origin of Species (1859). More direct measurements involve examinations of brains from corpses, or more recently, imaging techniques such as MRI, which can be used on living persons. Such measurements are used in research on neuroscience and intelligence.  The cephalic index  Swedish professor of anatomy Anders Retzius (1796‚Äì1860) first used the cephalic index in physical anthropology to classify ancient human remains found in Europe. He classified brains into three main categories, \\"dolichocephalic\\" (from the Ancient Greek kephal√™, head, and dolikhos, long and thin), \\"brachycephalic\\" (short and broad) and \\"mesocephalic\\" (intermediate length and width). These terms were then used by Georges Vacher de Lapouge (1854‚Äì1936), one of the pioneers of scientific theories in this area and a theoretician of eugenics, who in L'Aryen et son r√¥le social (1899 ‚Äì \\"The Aryan and his social role\\") divided humanity into various, hierarchized, different \\"races\\", spanning from the \\"Aryan white race, dolichocephalic\\", to the \\"brachycephalic\\" \\"mediocre and inert\\" race, best represented by the \\"Jew .\\" Between these, Vacher de Lapouge identified the \\"Homo europaeus (Teutonic, Protestant, etc.), the \\"Homo alpinus\\" (Auvergnat, Turkish, etc.), and finally the \\"Homo mediterraneus\\" (Napolitano, Andalus, etc.). \\"Homo africanus\\" (Congo, Florida) was even excluded from the discussion. Vacher de Lapouge became one of the leading inspirations of Nazi anti-semitism and Nazi ideology.See Pierre-Andr√© Taguieff, La couleur et le sang ‚Äì Doctrines racistes √† la fran√ßaise (\\"Colour and Blood ‚Äì doctrines √† la fran√ßaise\\"), Paris, Mille et une nuits, 2002, 203 pages, and La Force du pr√©jug√© ‚Äì Essai sur le racisme et ses doubles, Tel Gallimard, La D√©couverte, 1987, 644 pages His classification was mirrored in William Z. Ripley in The Races of Europe (1899).  Craniometry and anthropology  Pithecometra: In the frontispiece from his 1863 Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature, Thomas Huxley compared skeletons of apes to humans. In 1784, Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton, who wrote many comparative anatomy memoirs for the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, published the M√©moire sur les diff√©rences de la situation du grand trou occipital dans l‚Äôhomme et dans les animaux (which translates as Memoir on the Different Positions of the Occipital Foramen in Man and Animals). Six years later, Pieter Camper (1722‚Äì1789), distinguished both as an artist and as an anatomist, published some lectures containing an account of his craniometrical methods. These laid the foundation of all subsequent work. Pieter Camper invented the \\"facial angle\\", a measure meant to determine intelligence among various species. According to this technique, a \\"facial angle\\" was formed by drawing two lines: one horizontally from the nostril to the ear; and the other perpendicularly from the advancing part of the upper jawbone to the most prominent part of the forehead. Camper claimed that antique statues presented an angle of 90¬∞, Europeans of 80¬∞, Black people of 70¬∞ and the orangutan of 58¬∞, thus displaying a hierarchic view of mankind, based on a decadent conception of history. This scientific research was continued by √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772‚Äì1844) and Paul Broca (1824‚Äì1880). In 1856, workers found in a limestone quarry the skull of a Neanderthal man, thinking it to be the remains of a bear. They gave the material to amateur naturalist Johann Karl Fuhlrott, who turned the fossils over to anatomist Hermann Schaaffhausen. The discovery was jointly announced in 1857, giving rise to paleoanthropology. Measurements were first made to compare the skulls of men with those of other animals. This wide comparison constituted the first subdivision of craniometric studies. The artist- anatomist Camper's developed a theory to measure the facial angle, for which he is chiefly known in later anthropological literature. Camper's work followed 18th-century scientific theories. His measurements of facial angle were used to liken the skulls of non-Europeans to those of apes. Selection of Primate skulls. \\"Craniometry\\" also played a role in the foundation of the United States and the ideologies or racism that would become ingrained in the American psyche. As John Jeffries articulates in The Collision of Culture the Anglo-Saxon hegemony present in America during the eighteenth and nineteenth century helped establish \\"The American School of Craniometry\\" which helped establish the American and Western concept of race. As Jeffries points out the rigid establishment of race in eighteenth-century American society came from a new school of sciences which sought to distance Anglo-Saxons from the African American population. The distancing of the African population in American society through craniometry helped greatly in the efforts to scientifically prove they were inferior. The ideologies set forth by this new \\"American School\\" of thought were then used to justify maintaining an enslaved population to sustain the increasing number of slave plantations in the American South during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In the 19th century the names of notable contributors to the literature of craniometry quickly increased in number. While it is impossible to analyse each contribution, or even record a complete list of the names of the authors, notable researchers who used craniometric methods to compare humans to other animals included Paul Broca (1824‚Äì1880), founder of the Anthropological Society in 1859 in France; and T. H. Huxley (1825‚Äì1895) of England. By comparing skeletons of apes to man, Huxley backed up Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and developed the \\"Pithecometra principle\\", which stated that man and ape were descended from a common ancestor. Ernst Haeckel (1834‚Äì1919) became famous for his now outdated \\"recapitulation theory\\", according to which each individual mirrored the evolution of the whole species during his life. Although outdated, his work contributed then to the examination of human life. These researches on skulls and skeletons helped liberate 19th-century European science from its ethnocentric biases.\\"Cultural Biases Reflected in the Hominid Fossil Record\\" (history), by Joshua Barbach and Craig Byron, 2005, ArchaeologyInfo.com webpage: ArchaeologyInfo-003. In particular, Eug√®ne Dubois' (1858‚Äì1940) discovery in 1891 in Indonesia of the \\"Java Man\\", the first specimen of Homo erectus to be discovered, demonstrated mankind's deep ancestry outside Europe.  Cranial capacity, races and 19th‚Äì20th-century scientific ideas  Samuel George Morton (1799‚Äì1851), one of the inspirers of physical anthropology, collected hundreds of human skulls from all over the world and started trying to find a way to classify them according to some logical criterion. Influenced by the common theories of his time, he claimed that he could judge the intellectual capacity of a race by the cranial capacity (the measure of the volume of the interior of the skull). After inspecting three mummies from ancient Egyptian catacombs, Morton concluded that Caucasians and other races were already distinct three thousand years ago. Since the Bible indicated that Noah's Ark had washed up on Mount Ararat, only a thousand years ago before this, Morton claimed that Noah's sons could not possibly account for every race on Earth. According to Morton's theory of polygenism, races have been separate since the start.David Hurst Thomas, Skull Wars Kennewick Man, Archaeology, And The Battle For Native American Identity, 2001, pp. 38 ‚Äì 41 Morton claimed that he could judge the intellectual capacity of a race by the skull size. A large skull meant a large brain and high intellectual capacity, and a small skull indicated a small brain and decreased intellectual capacity. Morton collected hundreds of human skulls from all over the world. By studying these skulls he claimed that each race had a separate origin. Morton had many skulls from ancient Egypt, and concluded that the ancient Egyptians were not African, but were White. His two major monographs were the Crania Americana (1839), An Inquiry into the Distinctive Characteristics of the Aboriginal Race of America and Crania Aegyptiaca (1844). Based on craniometry data, Morton claimed in Crania Americana that the Caucasians had the biggest brains, averaging 87 cubic inches, Indians were in the middle with an average of 82 cubic inches and Negroes had the smallest brains with an average of 78 cubic inches. Stephen Jay Gould (1941‚Äì2002), an American paleontologist, evolutionary biologist and historian of science, studied these craniometric works in The Mismeasure of Man (1981) and claimed Samuel Morton had fudged data and \\"overpacked\\" the skulls with filler in order to justify his preconceived notions on racial differences. A subsequent study by the anthropologist John Michael found Morton's original data to be more accurate than Gould describes, concluding that \\"[c]ontrary to Gould's interpretation... Morton's research was conducted with integrity.\\" In 2011, physical anthropologists at the University of Pennsylvania, which owns Morton's collection, published a study that concluded that almost every detail of Gould's analysis was wrong and that \\"Morton did not manipulate his data to support his preconceptions, contra Gould.\\" They identified and remeasured half of the skulls used in Morton's reports, finding that in only 2% of cases did Morton's measurements differ significantly from their own and that these errors either were random or gave a larger than accurate volume to African skulls, the reverse of the bias that Gould imputed to Morton. Morton's followers, particularly Josiah C. Nott and George Gliddon in their monumental tribute to Morton's work, Types of Mankind (1854), carried Morton's ideas further and backed up his findings which supported the notion of polygenism. Charles Darwin opposed Nott and Glidon in his 1871 The Descent of Man, arguing for a monogenism of the species. Darwin conceived the common origin of all humans (the single-origin hypothesis) as essential for evolutionary theory. Furthermore, Josiah Nott was the translator of Arthur de Gobineau's An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races (1853‚Äì1855), which is one of the founding works of the group of studies that segregates society based on \\"race\\", in contrast to Boulainvilliers' (1658‚Äì1722) theory of races. Henri de Boulainvilliers opposed the Fran√ßais (French people), alleged descendants of the Nordic Franks, and members of the aristocracy, to the Third Estate, considered to be indigenous Gallo-Roman people who were subordinated by the Franks by right of conquest. Gobineau, meanwhile, made three main divisions between races, based not on colour but on climatic conditions and geographic location, and which privileged the \\"Aryan\\" race. In 1873, Paul Broca (1824‚Äì1880) found the same pattern described by Samuel Morton's Crania Americana by weighing brains at autopsy. Other historical studies alleging a Black-White difference in brain size include Bean (1906), Mall, (1909), Pearl, (1934) and Vint (1934). William Z. Ripley's map of the \\"cephalic index\\" in Europe, from The Races of Europe (1899). Furthermore, Georges Vacher de Lapouge's racial classification (\\"Teutonic\\", \\"Alpine\\" and \\"Mediterranean\\") was re-used by William Z. Ripley (1867‚Äì1941) in The Races of Europe (1899), who even made a map of Europe according to the alleged cephalic index of its inhabitants. In Germany, Rudolf Virchow launched a study of craniometry, which gave surprising results according to contemporary theories on the \\"Aryan race\\", leading Virchow to denounce the \\"Nordic mysticism\\" in the 1885 Anthropology Congress in Karlsruhe. Josef Kollmann, a collaborator of Virchow, stated in the same congress that the people of Europe, be them German, Italian, English or French, belonged to a \\"mixture of various races,\\" furthermore declaring that the \\"results of craniology\\" led to \\"struggle against any theory concerning the superiority of this or that European race\\" on others.Andrea Orsucci, \\"Ariani, indogermani, stirpi mediterranee: aspetti del dibattito sulle razze europee (1870‚Äì1914) , Cromohs, 1998 Virchow later rejected measure of skulls as legitimate means of taxinomy. Paul Kretschmer quoted an 1892 discussion with him concerning these criticisms, also citing Aurel von T√∂rok's 1895 work, who basically proclaimed the failure of craniometry.  Craniometry, phrenology and physiognomy Craniometry was also used in phrenology, which purported to determine character, personality traits, and criminality on the basis of the shape of the head and thus of the skull. At the turn of the 19th century, Franz Joseph Gall (1758‚Äì1822) developed \\"cranioscopy\\" (Ancient Greek kranion: skull, scopos: vision), a method to determine the personality and development of mental and moral faculties on the basis of the external shape of the skull. Cranioscopy was later renamed to phrenology (phrenos: mind, logos: study) by his student Johann Spurzheim (1776‚Äì1832), who wrote extensively on the \\"Drs. Gall and Spurzheim's physiognomical System.\\" Physiognomy claimed a correlation between physical features (especially facial features) and character traits. It was made famous by Cesare Lombroso (1835‚Äì1909), the founder of anthropological criminology, who claimed to be able to scientifically identify links between the nature of a crime and the personality or physical appearance of the offender. The originator of the concept of a \\"born criminal\\" and arguing in favor of biological determinism, Lombroso tried to recognize criminals by measurements of their bodies. He concluded that skull and facial features were clues to genetic criminality, and that these features could be measured with craniometers and calipers with the results developed into quantitative research. A few of the 14 identified traits of a criminal included large jaws, forward projection of jaw, low sloping forehead; high cheekbones, flattened or upturned nose; handle-shaped ears; hawk-like noses or fleshy lips; hard shifty eyes; scanty beard or baldness; insensitivity to pain; long arms, and so on.  Criticisms and revival of past cranial theories in the 20th century  An 1839 drawing by Samuel George Morton of \\"a Negro head‚Ä¶ a Caucasian skull‚Ä¶ a Mongol head.\\" After being a main influence of US white nationalists, William Ripley's The Races of Europe (1899) was eventually rewritten in 1939, just before World War II, by Harvard physical anthropologist Carleton S. Coon. J. Philippe Rushton, psychologist and author of the controversial work Race, Evolution and Behavior (1995), reanalyzed Gould's retabulation in 1989, and argued that Samuel Morton, in his 1839 book Crania Americana, had shown a pattern of decreasing brain size proceeding from East Asians, Europeans, and Africans. In his 1995 book Race, Evolution, and Behavior, Rushton alleged an average endocranial volume of 1,364 cm3 for East Asians, 1,347 for white caucasians and 1,268 for black Africans. Other similar claims were previously made by Ho et al. (1980), who measured 1,261 brains at autopsy, and Beals et al. (1984), who measured approximately 20,000 skulls, finding the same East Asian ‚Üí European ‚Üí African pattern. However, in the same article Beals explicitly warns against using the findings as indicative of racial traits, \\"If one merely lists such means by geographical region or race, causes of similarity by genogroup and ecotype are hopelessly confounded\\". Rushton's findings have also been criticized for questionable methodology. Such as lumping in African-Americans with equatorial Africans, as people from hot climates generally have slightly smaller crania.Cernovsky, Z. Z. (1997)A critical look at intelligence research, In Fox, D. & Prilleltensky, I. (Eds.) Critical Psychology, London: Sage, ps 121‚Äì133. Rushton also compared equatorial Africans from the poorest and least educated areas of Africa against Asians from the wealthiest and most educated areas of Asia and areas with colder climates which generally induce larger cranium sizes in evolution. According to Zack Cernovsky, from one of Rushton's own study emerges that the average cranial capacity for North American blacks is similar to the average for Caucasians from comparable climatic zones. Per Cernovsky, people from different climates tend to have minor differences in brain size, which do not necessarily imply differences in intelligence. Though women tend to have smaller brains than men they also have more neural complexity and loading in certain areas of the brain than men.Insider ‚Äì The Female Brain, By Ivory E.

It is a joint project of Philippine Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to interconnect through a common backbone or Internet Exchange Point (IX) for efficient infrastructure. it was interconnecting eight (8) ISPs namely: Evoserve, Infocom, IPhil, Moscom, Pacific Internet, Tridel, Virtualink, and WorldTel in exchanging local Internet traffic and G-Net, Globe Telecom‚Äôs ISP, was in the process of joining the Philippine Internet eXchange. History The idea to connect all the Internet Service Providers in the Philippines was first suggested in mid-1995 during the Internet Society (ISOC)-sponsored Internet Workshop held in Hawaii. Uniting competing ISPs posed a difficulty even though the benefits of an IX were obvious. In August 1995, exploratory discussions started within PLDT on the setting-up of the infrastructure for an Internet hub. In May 1996 it was decided to proceed with the network access point project, called Philippine Internet eXchange (PhIX). PhIX pilot operations started in January 1997. On 29 October 1996, PLDT formally presented its PhIX project to the 15 local ISPs which have their own gateway connections to other countries. Of the 15 ISPs who attended PLDT's presentation, the 5 largest ISPs signified their intention to join the PhIX project by signing the Multi-Lateral Peering Agreement on 19 November 1996, namely: Infocom, IPhil, Moscom, Virtualink and WorldTel Phil. The pilot operation of the PhIX was started in January 1997 and was completed in June 1997, and since then the 5 pioneering ISPs have successfully been exchanging Philippine-Centric New World Hotel on July 3, 1997. Objectives * To improve the efficiency of internet routing in the Philippines. * To enhance the overall quality and reliability of Philippine Internet services. * To maximize existing and future bandwidth capacities of ISPs in the Philippines * To reduce the size of the routing tables worldwide. * To create a truly Philippine-centric Internet. Updates =G-Net to Join PhIX= Globe Telecom‚Äôs Internet Service Provider (ISP), G-Net, is in the process of joining the Philippine Internet eXchange. Globe Telecom is a member of the Ayala Group of companies. G-Net is one of its services. G-Net would be peering via an E1 connection. =Tridel and Moscom Upgrades Bandwidth= Member ISPs are seeing the benefit of exchanging local Internet traffic.

Early life Thomas Oliver Chaplin was born in Hastings, East Sussex, to Sally and David Chaplin OBE, a month apart from future bandmate Tim Rice-Oxley's brother, also called Tom. Their mothers became friends and he started a friendship with the two brothers that endures today. Chaplin's father was headmaster of Vinehall School in Robertsbridge, so both friends were schooled there along with Richard Hughes, who would later be their bandmate. With Rice-Oxley and Hughes, Chaplin then attended Tonbridge School. Studying there, they met Dominic Scott (who was a founding member of Keane but left in 2001). During his time at Vinehall, Chaplin acted in several school plays and was part of the school's choral group. He also played the flute while at school. Chaplin attended the University of Edinburgh, prior to dropping out to pursue a career in music. Meanwhile, in 1995, the trio of Scott, Rice-Oxley and Hughes started their first band, The Lotus Eaters. It was a cover band that played U2, Oasis and The Beatles at Sussex pubs. Tim Rice-Oxley invited Chaplin to join the band as an acoustic guitar player. A short time later, in 1997, the band's name changed to Keane and Chaplin became the lead singer. Keane Chaplin was invited to join the band by Rice-Oxley, after he finally convinced the other two, in 1997, when the name The Lotus Eaters was changed to Cherry Keane, after a friend of Chaplin's mother. 'Cherry' was later removed from the name. In July 1997, Chaplin went to South Africa for his gap year, during which the rest of the band members were preparing themselves for a gig. When Hughes went to collect Chaplin a year later, on 3 July 1998, his first words were, \\"We've got a gig in ten days.\\" This would be the band's first performance at the Hope & Anchor pub on 13 July 1998. Chaplin then began studying for a degree in art history at the University of Edinburgh, before leaving to pursue his music career in London. During their stint in London, Chaplin shared a flat with Rice-Oxley in Stoke Newington and they tried to get money for rehearsal time. Chaplin worked at a publishing company where his chief responsibility was to carry boxes. With Scott in the line-up as the lead guitarist, Chaplin had to play the acoustic guitar. Since Scott left in 2001, he primarily takes lead vocals, but also plays the organ on \\"Hamburg Song\\" during some live gigs, as well as a distorted piano for newer songs on their second album. He also took part in Band Aid 20's re-recording of \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\" in November 2004 doing a solo on the line \\"feed the world\\", something that had not been done on previous versions where all artists sung. Solo career Having said that he intended to make a solo record during Keane's hiatus, Chaplin stated in January 2016 that he was recording his debut solo album in Los Angeles, California, with 40 songs written and whittled down to an album's worth. He announced in late June that the album was complete and that it would be out soon. It was rumoured that Tom was due to join a band with 3 unknown Scotch Whisky Ambassadors but the fact one of them dressed like Cotton Eyed Joe was a stumbling block. =2016‚Äì17: The Wave= The album name The Wave was announced via Twitter and Facebook on 10 August 2016. The same day, Hardened Heart was released with a music video. On 26 August 2016, \\"Quicksand\\" was released as the first single from the album. On 6 September 2016, Chaplin announced he would be playing eight intimate solo shows across the UK in October 2016. These were his first solo gigs for four years. The Wave was released on 14 October 2016 by Island Records. Four singles were released from the album: \\"Quicksand\\", \\"Still Waiting\\", \\"Solid Gold\\" (of which the single release is a collaboration with JONES, rather than the solo version which appears on the album), and \\"See It So Clear\\". The release of The Wave was followed by the announcement of the Carried by the Wave Tour, a longer set of dates running between January and September 2017. The tour consisted of four legs: first in the United States and Canada, then across Europe, a third leg in the UK during May 2017 and a last leg in Latin America. =2017‚Äìpresent: Twelve Tales of Christmas= On 13 October 2017, Chaplin announced that he had recorded his first solo Christmas album, entitled Twelve Tales of Christmas, to be released on 17 November 2017. Simultaneously the first single from the album was released, entitled \\"Under a Million Lights\\". The album consists of eight original tracks and four cover versions: \\"Walking in the Air\\" (written by Howard Blake), \\"2000 Miles\\" (originally by The Pretenders), \\"River\\" (originally by Joni Mitchell) and \\"Stay Another Day\\" (originally by East 17). It was also announced that Chaplin would be performing three gigs to accompany the release of the album; at the Palace Theatre in Manchester on 10 December 2017, at The Forum in Bath on 11 December and at the Royal Festival Hall in London on 12 December. Equipment Chaplin uses a Hammond XK2 organ for \\"Hamburg Song\\" and \\"Nothing in My Way\\". Since May 2006, he has used a Yamaha CP60M for live piano parts in \\"A Bad Dream\\", \\"The Frog Prince\\" and \\"Crystal Ball\\". He has played acoustic guitar in such songs as \\"Your Eyes Open\\" since the 2006 UK tour, and during 2007 played acoustic solos of \\"Broken Toy\\" and \\"The Frog Prince\\". He played guitar on Keane's third album, Perfect Symmetry and has been the lead guitarist in live shows for the album. Tom plays three different Fender Telecaster guitars: one red, one white and one light blue. In an interview with Keane Backline, Rice-Oxley stated that Chaplin had been interested in learning to play the theremin, but \\"couldn't be bothered to learn how to use it\\", also stating that the theremin \\"might be the only way of reproducing the musical saw sound\\" used in some tracks of Perfect Symmetry. Personal life Chaplin married his girlfriend, Natalie Dive in June 2011. He has a daughter born on 20 March 2014. He resides in Wittersham, Kent. Chaplin is a keen golfer, supporter of Ipswich Town and of the England cricket team. Chaplin identifies as an agnostic.Chaplin, T. (18 August 2015) \\"Just agnostic with a mistrust of religion.\\" Twitter.com =Drug rehabilitation= On 22 August 2006, Chaplin stated that he was receiving treatment for drug abuse problems. He and his bandmates cancelled their North American tour for his rehabilitation after he left their hotel in Japan with no warning, choosing to fly back to Britain alone. He left the Priory clinic in London on 6 October, but continued to receive treatment after leaving. In August 2016, Chaplin said in an interview with music critic Neil McCormick that he began using drugs during the anticipation of his solo album. He said anxiety over the album caused him to get \\"back to shovelling coke up (his) nose.\\" Chaplin said he nearly died one night in 2015. He said people began to give up on him, and his wife once told him she loved him in case she never saw him again. Chaplin recovered by seeing a psychoanalyst. He said the past 12 months have been the happiest of his life with his wife and daughter.

In the , Kangaroo Point had a population of 8,063 people. The suburb features two prominent attractions, the Story Bridge and Kangaroo Point Cliffs.  Geography  Kangaroo Point is located directly east across the Brisbane River from the Brisbane central business district, but being on the south side of the river is normally regarded as a southern suburb. Kangaroo Point is located on a peninsula formed of harder rhyolite rock which the Brisbane River flows around. On the northern tip of the peninsula the Story Bridge connects it to the central business district and the suburb of Fortitude Valley. The suburb of Woolloongabba is located to the south. The six-lane Main Street runs from Story Bridge to Woolloongabba. The landscape of Kangaroo Point is predominantly high rise apartments towards the tip of the peninsula while the southern end is predominantly low-medium density apartments and Queenslander type houses. At the northern tip of the peninsula is Captain Burke Park () with the Holman Street ferry wharf, barbeques, picnic facilities, playground, and outdoor fitness facilities.  History  Navy's main stores below the Kangaroo Point cliffs, with the gunship Paluma moored in the Brisbane River in the 1890s. Kangaroo Point Ferry Terminal ca. 1928 Before British settlement, Kangaroo Point was settled by the Turrbal people. It is one of the earliest suburbs settled in Brisbane and subsequently, is one of Brisbane's oldest suburbs, rich in history and character. It had a reputation for violent and rowdy street gangs around the 1900s, with a number of street riots. In 1823, explorer John Oxley described Kangaroo Point as a \\"jungle, fringed with mangroves with the higher land open forest, covered with grass\\". During the time of the subsequent convict settlement (1825‚Äì1841), Kangaroo Point was cleared and used for cultivation of crops. Subsequently, the area was opened up for free settlement, the first land sales taking place on 13 December 1843. Among the early purchasers was Captain John Clements Wickham, the Police Magistrate and later Government Resident. Surveyor James Warner built the first house at Kangaroo Point in 1844. Kangaroo Point's first school was opened in 1861 by the Church of England. It came under the control of the Board of Education in 1867 and consisted of a boys department and a girls department. A separate Girls and Infants school opened on 2 March 1874. This was replaced by the Kangaroo Point Girls School and the Kangaroo Point Infants School which both opened on 20 January 1890. The Kangaroo Point Boys School, Girls School and Infants School closed on 28 April 1950 and amalgamated to become the Kangaroo Point State School.BCM 1960 : Kangaroo Point State School in Main St The Kangaroo Point State School closed on 30 June 1965. The site was subsequently redeveloped as a TAFE college, on the corner of River Terrace and Main Street. In January 2010 this site was redeveloped into parkland extending the Kangaroo Point Cliffs Park (). In September 1865, 42 allotments of portion 35 of Kangaroo Point were advertised to be auctioned for sale by Arthur Martin & Co. A map advertising the auction contained a diagram of subdivisions 1 to 31 situated between Ipswich Road and the Brisbane River. St Joseph's Catholic Primary School was founded by Mary MacKillop and opened on 19 March 1870 in Hubert Street in One Mile Swamp (now Woolloongabba) with 70 students. In January 1871, the school relocated to Leopold Street (not Leopard Street) at Kangaroo Point into an unlined timber building with a shingle roof on land provided by James Toohey. In 1879 the Sisters of Mercy took over the operation of the school, following a dispute between MacKillop and the Catholic Bishop of Brisbane. In 1887, the Yungaba Immigration Centre was built on Main Street at Kangaroo Point to replace the poor facilities at the existing centre in William Street. In June 1888, six allotments, being subdivisions 1 to 6 of subdivisions 7 to 11 of portions 68 in the Parish of Kangaroo Point, on Walmsley Street between the Garden Point Ferry and Main Street were advertised to be auctioned for sale by Simon Fraser & Son. A map advertising the auction contained a local sketch by the surveyors, Hamilton & Raff. In September 1928, 19 subdivisions adjacent to the Brisbane River and titled \\"Town Reach River Sites\\" were advertised to be auctioned for sale by Isles, Love & Co Limited. A map advertising the auction includes an aerial photograph and a panoramic photograph of the area. For many years the suburb was dominated by the factories of heavy engineering businesses, particularly those involved in the maritime industry, such as Evans Deakin, Buzzacott & Co and Evans, Anderson, Phelan & Co. Evans Deakin built the largest ship ever constructed on the Brisbane River, the 66,000 tonne oil tanker Robert Miller, which became adrift in the river during the 1974 Brisbane flood. The last vessel to be built by Evans Deakin was an oil rig called Southern Cross. The company vacated the site in 1976, with it later being redeveloped for high-rise accommodation. Stone was quarried from the cliffs and used as building material. Until the 1930s, Evans Anderson & Phelan built steam locomotives at their Kangaroo Point works for Queensland Railways, however their works were not located near a railway, so the completed locomotives were delivered along Main Street on temporary track. Until the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901, the Queensland Navy's main storage facility was located in the suburb. The first ship-based radio transmission in Australia was made between HMAS Gayundah and the buildings in 1903. The naval stores buildings were occupied by the Royal Australian Navy until 1959, and then by the Australian Army until 1984. The heritage-listed buildings are now used by an adventure company focussing on river activities and rock climbing. The opening of the Story Bridge () in July 1940 was the most significant development of the suburb. Trolleybuses operated by the Brisbane City Council linked the suburb with Fortitude Valley via the Story Bridge from 1953 to 1969, running along Main Street from Woolloongabba and other eastern suburbs. In 2004 2% of sex workers in Queensland were street prostitutes operating in inner Brisbane suburbs such as Kangaroo Point. In the , Kangaroo Point had a population of 8,063 people. Attractions Kangaroo Point is a popular recreation spot, conveniently close to the city and the South Bank Parklands. The Kangaroo Point Cliffs, situated on the east bank of the city bend of the Brisbane River north of the Maritime Museum, opposite Riverstage and the Queensland University of Technology at Gardens Point. The Look-out at Kangaroo Point is also included as one of the stops of Brisbane Transport's City Sights bus service. Kangaroo Point is also home to one of less than 200 Mormon temples in the world {as of August 2015}. Kangaroo Point is also home to Ellis Street, one of the 20 steepest hills in Brisbane according to Brisbane City Council. Kangaroo Point is also home to the more- than-160-year-old St Mary's Anglican Church. CBD from Kangaroo Point cliffs The cliffs are a popular picnic, rock climbing and abseiling site. The steepness of the cliffs was increased by quarrying operations which mined the volcanic rock or rhyolite lava flows which form the cliffs. The lava was deposited in the Triassic Period about 230 million years ago and filled up an ancient river valley. They currently form the banks of the Brisbane River. The Story Bridge is a prominent landmark. It is able to be climbed with authorised tourist groups and provides the main means of access to the north of Brisbane. Directly under the bridge is the Story Bridge Hotel, and Yungaba, one of Brisbane's most unusual and iconic landmarks.Kangaroo Point Brisbane Tourism Guide. Retrieved on 2013-11-07. The Kangaroo Point Natural History Project was implemented by the council in 2013 to recognise the contribution by some of Queensland's pioneering scientists and researchers from the area. Along a heritage trail through the CT White and James Warner parks are a series of signs and sculptures to commemorate their lives and work: Cyril Tenison White (government botanist), Frederick Manson Bailey (colonial botanist), Silvester Diggles (naturalist), Oscar Werner Tiegs (entomologist and zoologist), James Warner (surveyor), and Harry Oakman (landscape artist).

It diverts some traffic travelling through the suburb while providing an additional transport route for residents. A green bridge was proposed in 2010 to the west to connect Kangaroo Point to Brisibane City and to the east to connect Kangaroo Point to Merthyr Road New Farm, but at March 2020 these projects have not been progressed. The Cross River Rail tunnel is planned to connect under Kangaroo Point Cliffs from Woolloongabba to an Albert Street railway station.

Joffe (1909‚Äì2000) was Professor of Mycology and Mycotoxicology at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem. Joffe's professional interests were centered primarily in toxigenic fungi associated with production of mycotoxins (aflatoxins, trichothecenes, and other toxins); ecology and environmental factors favoring formation and distribution of Fusarium mycotoxins in cereal grains, feeds and foods; and phytotoxic action of Fusarium strains, and their toxicity in animals and humans. Joffe is the author of over 130 scientific papers, reviews and monographs. He was a member of several professional associations, a participant in numerous International Conferences and Symposia, and holds two Certificates of Merit from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Ministry of Health of the USSR.

They are traditionally considered radiolarians, but in molecular trees do not appear to be close relatives of the other groups, and are instead placed among the Cercozoa. They are distinguished by the structure of their central capsule and by the presence of a phaeodium, an aggregate of waste particles within the cell. The term \\"Radiozoa\\" has been used to refer to radiolaria when Phaeodarea is explicitly excluded. Phaeodarea produce hollow skeletons composed of amorphous silica and organic material, which rarely fossilize. The endoplasm is divided by a cape with three openings, of which one gives rise to feeding pseudopods, and the others let through bundles of microtubules that support the axopods. Unlike true radiolarians, there are no cross-bridges between them. They also lack symbiotic algae, generally living below the photic zone, and do not produce any strontium sulphate.

They are typically conducted by government or military institutions. In a military setting, a \\"Captain's Mast\\", held by a commanding officer of a U.S. Navy unit is one such administrative proceeding. As a consequence of the proceeding, the commander may impose non-judicial punishment upon members of the command. Various other administrations of government (for example, a department regulating motor vehicles, air pollution, forestry practices, or real estate sales agents) may impose fines or revocation of permits or licenses upon persons or corporations for acts of commission or omission found to be violating operating, permitting, reporting, or other rules. Such rules are typically formulated in the specific by the administrative authority under general authority established and limited by statute. There may be additional paths of judicial appeal in some cases, provided all appeal paths internal to the administrative group have been exhausted., In general, such appeals are usually not based on the determination of fact (unless relevant evidence was not allowed to be presented), but rather on some legal theory that the administrative body exceeded its statutory authority, or that the administrative body did not follow its own established rules of procedure, or that the authorising statute itself or the subsequently derived rules are defective in some way, for example by being an unconstitutional infringement of some constitutional right. In these cases the case may be remanded to the authority for further examination and determination under the new rules established by the court or the administrative decision may be declared null and void with prejudice.

HK-47 is disabled at the beginning of The Sith Lords; the player's character recovers material from damaged droids to repair HK-47. Dialogue in The Sith Lords expands on the droid's backstory and purpose, establishing that Revan used the droid to kill people who destabilized or weakened the galaxy. In the time frame of the Trials of Obi-Wan expansion to Star Wars Galaxies, HK-47's artificial intelligence has transferred into a computer on a Galactic Republic cruiser that later crashed on Mustafar. The droid calls on players to complete several quests to return him to a droid body. HK-47 was included as an action figure in the Champions of the Force line of Star Wars figures.

It was his second collaboration with David Bowie after The Idiot, released earlier in the year. The album achieved critical acclaim and became Pop's most commercially successful album to date; it also remains his only gold-certified release in the United Kingdom. Production The Lust for Life sessions took place soon after the completion of a concert tour in support of The Idiot, the tour ending on April 16, 1977. Pop has stated, \\"David and I had determined that we would record that album very quickly, which we wrote, recorded, and mixed in eight days, and because we had done it so quickly, we had a lot of money left over from the advance, which we split.\\" The singer slept little during its making, commenting \\"See, Bowie's a hell of a fast guy ... I realized I had to be quicker than him, otherwise whose album was it gonna be?\\" Pop prepared only fragments of lyrics before singing, and essentially improvised at the microphone. This spontaneous lyrical method inspired Bowie to improvise his own words on his next project, \\"Heroes\\". Bowie, Pop and engineer Colin Thurston produced Lust for Life under the pseudonym \\"Bewlay Bros.\\", named after the final track on Bowie's 1971 album Hunky Dory. The recording was made at Hansa Studio by the Wall in Berlin and featured Ricky Gardiner and Carlos Alomar on guitars with Hunt and Tony Sales on drums and bass, respectively. With Bowie on keyboards and backing vocals, the team included three-quarters of the future Tin Machine line-up; the Sales brothers' \\"gale-force\\" contribution to this album led Bowie to invite them to join his new band twelve years later (\\"Check out Lust for Life,\\" he told guitarist Reeves Gabrels, \\"I've found the rhythm section!\\"). The sleeve photo was taken by Andy Kent, who also shot the cover for The Idiot. Music and themes Lust for Life is generally considered to be more of an Iggy Pop record than the Bowie-dominated The Idiot, being less experimental and having more of a rock and roll flavor. However, some of its themes were similarly dark, as in \\"The Passenger\\", cited by NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray as one of Pop's \\"most haunting\\" tracks, and \\"Tonight\\" and \\"Turn Blue\\", both of which dealt with heroin abuse. In contrast were more upbeat songs such as \\"Success\\" and \\"Lust for Life\\", the latter of which described by Rolling Stone as Pop's \\"survivor message to the masses\\". According to Pop, Bowie's celebrated riff on \\"Lust for Life\\" was inspired by the Morse code opening to the American Forces Network news in Berlin. At various points in the song, the melody is doubled by the entire band; in Carlos Alomar's words, \\"You can't play a counter-rhythm to that, you just had to follow\\". Joy Division and New Order drummer Stephen Morris declared, \\"On Lust for Life the drums sound not huge but massive! The loudest cymbals known to man, that riff! I wanted to sound like that, still do.\\" \\"The Passenger\\" was inspired by a Jim Morrison poem that saw \\"modern life as a journey by car\\", as well as rides on the Berlin S-Bahn, according to Pop's former girlfriend Esther Friedmann. The lyrics have also been interpreted as \\"Iggy's knowing commentary on Bowie's cultural vampirism\\". The music, a \\"laid-back ... springy groove\\", was composed by guitarist Ricky Gardiner. It was released as the B-side of the album's first single \\"Success\\". Characterized by AllMusic as \\"a glorious throwaway\\" and by Rolling Stone as \\"an infectious throwaway\\", \\"Success\\" was a light-hearted track of the call and response variety. At just under seven minutes, \\"Turn Blue\\", the longest song on the album, was a sprawling confessional that dated back to an abortive recording session by Bowie and Pop in May 1975, when the latter was in the depths of his drug addiction. Originally titled \\"Moving On\\", it was composed by Bowie, Pop, Walter Lacey, and Warren Peace. It was the only set of lyrics that did not appear on the original vinyl record sleeve. The album's remaining tracks included \\"Sixteen\\", the only piece written entirely by Iggy Pop, \\"Some Weird Sin\\", a hard rock number featuring a \\"lost-boy lyric\\", the \\"neo-punk\\" \\"Neighborhood Threat\\", and \\"Fall in Love with Me\\", which grew from an impromptu jam by the band to which Pop composed lyrics apparently evoking his then-girlfriend Esther Friedmann. Release =Original edition= \\"Success\\", backed with \\"The Passenger\\", was released on 30 September 1977 as a single from the album. =2020 deluxe edition= On April 10, 2020, Pop released an alternate mix of \\"China Girl\\" from The Idiot in promotion of the forthcoming release of The Bowie Years, a seven-disc deluxe box set featuring expanded remastered versions of The Idiot and Lust for Life. The box set, released on May 29, includes remastered versions of both albums along with outtakes, alternate mixes and a 40-page book. The two original albums were also re-released individually, each paired with an additional album of live material to create separate stand-alone two-disc deluxe editions. Reception =Critical reception= In a contemporary review, Rolling Stone critic Billy Altman considered that \\"purely on its own terms, Lust for Life is a successful album\\", but complained that Pop's \\"new stance is so utterly unchallenging and cautious.\\" By contrast, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice refuted the critical opinion that Pop's \\"creative power has dissipated\\", finding The Idiot and Lust for Life to be more consistent than Pop's albums with the Stooges. He later noted that of the two, he preferred Lust for Life \\"because it's faster and more assertive‚Äîwhich means, among other things, that the nihilistic satire is counteracted by the forward motion of the music itself.\\" =Charts= Lust for Life reached number 28 on the UK Albums Chart and remained Pop's highest-charting release in the UK until 2016's Post Pop Depression. Initially the album sold well in the United States but the death of Elvis Presley caused RCA to quickly reissue Presley's catalogue and any promotional focus for Pop's album was lost. It eventually performed well in the US, although it only reached number 120 on the Billboard charts at the time of its release. Covers and live versions \\"Lust for Life\\" and \\"Sixteen\\" appeared the following year on the live set TV Eye. Bowie covered \\"Tonight\\" (minus the opening lines referencing drugs) with Tina Turner, along with \\"Neighborhood Threat\\", on his 1984 release Tonight. Siouxsie and the Banshees recorded a cover of \\"The Passenger\\" with brass instruments on their 1987 album Through the Looking Glass. Pop praised it, commmenting: \\"She threw a little note in when she sings it that I wish I had thought of, it's kind of improved it [...] The horn thing is good.\\" \\"The Passenger\\" has also been performed by Nick Cave, R.E.M., Bauhaus, The Lunachicks, Michael Hutchence (on the Batman Forever soundtrack), amongst others (Brazilian band Capital Inicial has recorded a version in Portuguese which is called \\"O Passageiro\\"). Duran Duran covered \\"Success\\" on the favorites collection Thank You. \\"Lust for Life\\" has been played by artists including Yo La Tengo, The Damned, The Smithereens, Tom Jones and The Pretenders, and David Bowie live, and is used as bumper music on The Jim Rome Show; it is also used as the theme music for the ongoing advertising campaign for Royal Caribbean International. Its distinctive riff is commonly cited as inspiring Australian band Jet for their song \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\", while the drum riff was sampled by Welsh band Manic Street Preachers for the outro of their song \\"You Love Us\\" and by Scottish band Travis for the intro to their single \\"Selfish Jean\\". The main riff was interpolated into the break section of \\"What Is Happening\\" by Alphabeat.

Their music can be described to have heavy metal guitars combined with the clear voice of singer Johanna DePierre. History = Formation = Amaran started out as a band in the spring of 2000, in Stockholm, Sweden, and then developed a dynamic and original way of writing songs, combining heavy metal guitars with clear female vocals. Guitarists Kari Kainulainen and Ronnie Backlund started writing some music together and decided to form a band. They found the rest of the band members in bass player Mikael Andersson, vocalist Johanna DePierre and drummer Robin Bergh. All of the members came from different musical backgrounds and were eager to put produce music together. = \\"Promo\\" (2001) = Before they had even found a drummer Amaran recorded their first \\"Promo\\" using a drum machine and sent it to various zines, magazines and record labels. It received excellent reviews in many well-acclaimed contexts, and also ended up landing them a record deal with the French record label, Listenable Records. = A World Depraved (2002) = The band set out to record their debut album A World Depraved in February 2002 in Aabenraa Studio in Denmark together with Jacob Hansen. The album was released over Europe and was highly recommended by critics and fans all over. The album was often described as somewhat original, in the sense that the combination of heavy guitars and intense drums and the clear female vocals was not something that people were used to hearing. = Pristine In Bondage (2004)= Amaran was eager to write new songs after the release of the debut and developed a whole lot in this process and as a band during 2002. Since the band was pretty young when they landed the record deal they went through a whole lot both on a personal and professional level, and became tighter as a band. The band finished about 14 songs that they wanted to record and agreed with Listenable to record the follow-up in April 2003. The new material was oriented in a heavier direction as to accentuate the dynamics between the instrumental and the vocals further. The album was recorded in Studio Underground, Sweden with Pelle Saether and was entitled Pristine in Bondage. Shortly after finishing the recording of the second album, bass player Mikael decided that he wanted to leave the band due to personal reasons. Fortunately they quickly found someone to replace him in Ronnie Bergerst√•hl, an experienced bass player and drummer who was a personal friend and had filled in for Mikael before. Pristine in Bondage was set to be released through Listenable Records on 17 December in Japan (containing three bonus tracks) and, in January, in Europe and the US containing 11 tracks. Amaran has also recorded a video for the song \\"Inflict\\" on the new album, and was set to go on promotion tours in the fall and in January connected the release of the album. = Break up = Drummer Robin Bergh left the band for personal reasons in 2004, he was replaced with P√§r Hjulstr√∂m. 2005 saw a parade of new members pass through Amaran, culminating in December with the dissolution of the band. Primary among the reasons for this is the departure of lead singer Johanna DePierre, and the band's inability to find a suitable replacement (Amaran's sole focus as a band was heavy riffs with clean female vocals). Amaran officially broke up on December 28, 2005.

He was a younger brother of top-scoring ace Manfred von Richthofen (the Red Baron) and a distant cousin of Luftwaffe Field Marshal Wolfram von Richthofen. Following the war he worked for a while on a farm before taking an industrial position. He married in June 1919 and had two children. Yearning for aviation he accepted a position as a pilot, conveying passengers and postal mail between Berlin and Hamburg. He died aged 27 on 4 July 1922 in a flying accident at Fuhlsb√ºttel.  Early career and Jasta 11  Richthofen was born on 27 September 1894. He and his brothers, Manfred and Bolko,Burrows 1970, p. 36.Not to be confused with the archaeologist Bolko von Richthofen, a distant cousin hunted wild boar, elk, birds, and deer.Burrows 1970, pp. 37‚Äì38. Like his brother Manfred, Lothar began the war as a cavalry officer with the 4th Dragoon Regiment. He had remained in the public Gymnasium (high school), he was enrolled in compulsory military training at the Kriegsschule in Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk, Poland) when war began. On his own initiative Lothar returned to his unit. Lothar was nearly cut down by sniper fire while on patrol. In mid-October 1914, while stationed at Attigny, he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class for valour. It was the only consolation that Lothar received during his cavalry service. The following month, his regiment was transferred to the Eastern Front.Kilduff 1994, p. 27. In February 1915 Manfred \\"rescued\\" his brother Lothar from the boredom of training new troops in Luben and encouraged him to also transfer to the Fliegertruppe.Kilduff 1994, p. 41. Richthofen joined the German Army Air Service (Luftstreitkr√§fte) in late 1915. He served from January 1916 as an observer with Jasta 23, sometimes observing for Otto CreutzmannFranks et al 1993 p. 94. and saw action during the Battle of Verdun. He won the Iron Cross 1st Class in December and then began training as a pilot. Lothar von Richthofen (seated on the ground) with other members of Jasta 11. His brother, Manfred, is in the cockpit. Photographed April 23, 1917 His first posting as a pilot was to his brother's Jasta 11 on 6 March 1917. An impulsive and aggressive pilot, unlike his coolly calculating brother Manfred, Lothar's first victory claim followed on 28 March for an FE 2b of No. 25 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps.von Richthofen, Mein Kriegstagebuch (1937), p. 101. The German high command appreciated the propaganda value of two Richthofens fighting together to defeat the enemy in the air.Richthofen, The Red Knight of the Air (n.d.), pp. 164‚Äì165. Taking part in the period of German dominance called Bloody April by the British, Lothar had won 15 more victories by the beginning of May. When his brother went on leave, Lothar von Richthofen assumed command of the squadron.  Albert Ball  During the first week of May 1917, Lothar von Richthofen scored three more victories. On the evening of 7 May near Douai, he led a flight of 5 Albatros D.III's from Jasta 11 that encountered 11 S.E.5s from the \\"elite\\" No. 56 Squadron RFC, including the top English ace of the time, Captain Albert Ball, as well as a SPAD S.VII from No. 19 Squadron, and a Sopwith Triplane of No 8 (Naval) Squadron. In a running battle in deteriorating visibility in the middle of a thunderstorm over Bourlon Wood, both sides became scattered. Richthofen engaged in single combat with the British Triplane. At about the same time, Ball was seen by fellow 56 Squadron pilot Cyril Crowe chasing a red Albatros into a thundercloud. Ball lost control of his plane and crashed fatally. Though forced to land his damaged aircraft, Richthofen escaped injury. The British Sopwith Triplane involved in the action returned to base undamaged. Richthofen posted a claim for shooting down the Sopwith Triplane. However, the propaganda value of Ball's death under the guns of a German pilot was obvious, and the German High Command awarded a victory over Ball to Lothar. The fallacy of the award was readily apparent. The idea that an experienced pilot such as Richthofen would confuse a triplane with a biplane was ludicrous. Leutnant Hailer, a German pilot on the ground who witnessed the crash and was the first German at the crash scene saw no battle damage to Ball's plane. The doctor who autopsied Ball reported massive injuries to Ball from the crash, but no bullet wounds. Nevertheless, the official line was that Lothar von Richthofen shot down Albert Ball. Later research suggests that Ball became disoriented by vertigo, accidentally entering an inverted dive which choked his plane's carburetor and stopped the engine, causing him to crash.  Pour le M√©rite  Richthofen raised his total to 24 by 13 May, when, after shooting down a BE.2, he was wounded in the hip by anti-aircraft fire and crash-landed; his injuries kept him out of combat for five months. On 14 May he was awarded the Pour le M√©rite, and he resumed command of Jasta 11 in September 1917. In early 1918 he suffered a severe ear infection and was hospitalised in Berlin. Returning to his unit in February, he claimed 3 Bristol Fighter F2.Bs on 11 and 12 March, before he was again forced down on 13 March by a Sopwith Camel flown by Captain Augustus Orlebar of No. 73 Squadron. Nursing his crippled Fokker Dr1 Triplane into a landing, Richthofen clipped a high-tension wire and crashed heavily, suffering serious head injuries. He was still recovering when he learned of his brother's death. Lothar returned to service with Jasta 11 in July 1918. He scored his final victory (a DH-9a) on 12 August 1918, flying a Fokker D.VII. The next day he was again wounded in action against Sopwith Camels, probably by Captain Field E. Kindley of the 148th Aero Squadron USAS.Richthofen: Beyond the Legend of the Red Baron, Peter Kilduff, 1993 Lothar may also have been forced down by Canadian RAF pilot William Stephenson, later known as the World War II spymaster code-named \\"Intrepid\\".A Man Called Intrepid, by William Stephenson (1977), Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, p. 9. Lothar was promoted to Oberleutnant, and saw no further combat before the war ended in November. Considering the amount of time Lothar von Richthofen spent on the front and in hospitals, he was one of the most combat efficient and prolific flying aces of the war, perhaps even more so than his brother Manfred. Of his total of 40 confirmed victories, Lothar scored 33 in just three months: 15 in April 1917, 8 in May 1917, and 10 in August 1918.  Post war  With the return of peace, Lothar von Richthofen worked briefly on a farm before accepting an industrial position. He married Countess Doris von Keyserlingk in Cammerau in June 1919, fathering a son, Wolf-Manfred (1922‚Äì2010) and a daughter, Carmen Viola (1920‚Äì1971), before the marriage was dissolved. He then became a commercial pilot, carrying passengers and mail between Berlin and Hamburg.  Death  On July 4, 1922 Richthofen died in a crash of his LVG C VI at Hamburg due to an engine failure. Also on board were actress Fern Andra and her director Georg Bluen. Both Bluen and Andra survived, Andra spending a year recovering from her injuries. Lothar von Richthofen was interred next to his father at the Garrison Cemetery in Schweidnitz, but the cemetery was levelled by the Poles when the city was transferred to Poland after World War II. Today the area is a football field, although von Richthofen's headstone still exists. A plaque to Lothar's memory is next to his brother Manfred von Richthofen's grave on the S√ºdfriedhof in Wiesbaden.

It is on the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines between Wood Lane and Ladbroke Grove stations and is in Travelcard Zone 2. Location Unusually, Latimer Road and the station that bears its name are not geographically close, being approximately 500 metres apart and on opposite sides of the Westway Flyover (A40 road) ‚Äì the road being to the north and the station to the south.Google Maps - Latimer Road Underground Station Prior to the construction of the Westway and the elevated roundabout that joins it to the West Cross Route (A3220), Latimer Road ran further south and closer to the station. The construction of the elevated road required the demolition of the central section of Latimer Road and the truncated and isolated southern end of the road was renamed as part of Freston Road. Despite the renaming of the southern part of the road, the station retained its original name. The road was named after Edward Latymer, who bequeathed the land to build the road in order to help fund the school in Hammersmith that he founded, Latymer Upper School. Freston is the name of the ancestral village in Suffolk of the Latymer family. History Map of stations in Shepherd's Bush area showing Latimer Road and the closed connection to Uxbridge Road station The station opened on 16 December 1868 at a junction formed between two existing railway lines ‚Äì the Hammersmith & City Railway (owned by the Great Western Railway and running between Westbourne Park and Hammersmith stations) and the West London Railway (WLR) (between Willesden Junction and Addison Road (now Kensington (Olympia)) stations). Services to Addison Road were originally provided via the junction to the WLR tracks but these were discontinued in 1940 and the junction no longer exists. The line between Latimer Road and Uxbridge Road was then closed and the raised train track demolished. The remains of that stretch of track can be seen from the west end of the eastbound platform, which now houses a secure Relay Room. In July 2010, the westbound platform 2 was closed to begin refurbishment and extension work, in preparation for the new S Stock, to be introduced on the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines from 2012, which will consist of 7 cars instead of the current 6-car configuration. Volker Rail has been contracted by TfL to demolish and rebuild both the east- and westbound platforms, starting with the westbound platform and then moving over to the eastbound. Reportedly it had been paid 7 million pounds to carry out the work laid out in the original plans. However the plans changed due to the poor conditions of the arches underneath the platforms, the poor condition of the lattice girders on the bridge over Bramley Road, and subsidence at ground level in the ticket hall. The station closed completely on Monday 17 January 2011 for 14 weeks. The westbound platform re-opened first, and the eastbound platform's re-opening on Monday 1 August 2011 heralded the station's full return to service.CULG Hammersmith & City line - Dates A new station entrance is to be built next to the disused kiosk after underpinning work has been carried out to the station's green painted wall facing Bramley Road. From 5 October 2014 to 3 November the same year, eastbound trains did not stop at the station to allow for refurbishment work on the staircase between the ticket hall and the eastbound platform.Latimer Road Closure The station today Latimer Road Tube Station with Trellick Tower in the background. =Design= The station ticket hall at Latimer Road is located at ground level within the arches of the viaduct carrying the tracks above. The platforms are accessed by stairs and retain much of their original character with simple open timber canopies. =Station facilities= The station has a ticket hallLatimer Road Tube Station - FacilitiesLatimer Road Underground Station - Transport for London and 2 passenger-operated machines (or POMs). The larger POM, called a Multi Fare Machine (MFM) accepts UK Sterling notes, up to ¬£20 and gives change of 10p, 50p, ¬£1 and ¬£2 coins. The smaller machine, known as an Advance Fare Machine (AFM), does not give change and accepts overpayment up to 30p. Both machines accept most major credit and debit cards; however, to help combat fraud, individual cards can only be used once a day. These machines are the standard London Underground installation at all LU operated stations. The station also has Electric Service Update Boards or ESUBS. These large screens advertise service information which is updated from the Network Operations Centre, located at London Underground's head office above St James's Park tube station. There are 5 Customer Help Points on the station, 1 in the ticket hall at ground level and 2 on each platform. These communication devices are connected to the Station Control Room at Ladbroke Grove station. They are mostly used by customers to find out where or when their next train is due, but can be used to contact staff or the police in an emergency. There are also 3 payphones at the station and waiting room on the platforms. The station kiosk has been closed for many years. It is now used by London Underground as a storage area. =Proximity to Grenfell Tower= Grenfell Tower, which was destroyed in a fire on 14 June 2017, killing 72 people, stands behind the station, and there is a clear view of the tower from the Paddington-bound platform. Automated announcements asking passengers waiting for trains not to take photos of the fire-damaged building are made by Transport for London, mainly as a mark of respect to those who died or were otherwise affected by the disaster, but also so that any flashes from smartphones or cameras do not distract train drivers looking at signals en route. The UK government has requested that the station be renamed as a tribute to Grenfell Tower, a process that will need to be explored by Transport for London.Principles Governing Consultations on the Future of the Grenfell Tower Site.

He was intimately involved with the investigation of the Cambridge Five and the interrogation of Klaus Fuchs. After rapidly and non-coercively eliciting a confession from Fuchs, Skardon acquired the reputation of a very skilful interrogator. However his own report of the Fuchs interrogation indicates that Fuchs -- apparently in a condition of considerable mental stress -- volunteered his entire confession with very little prompting. Peter Wright also claimed that the success of that interrogation depended mainly on the detailed brief supplied to Skardon, plus the \\"listeners\\" who picked Fuchs' lies to pieces. Skardon's subsequent record in interrogations was considerably less successful, and his success with Fuchs led to these negative results being given too much credence. Some of Skardon's subsequent failures include: * Kim Philby - interrogated ten times without result (although apparently never given a free hand) * Anthony Blunt - interviewed and cleared 11 times between 1951 and 1964. Finally confessed in 1964 when confronted with incontrovertible evidence. * John Cairncross - interviewed and cleared in 1952, despite strong circumstantial evidence being found in Burgess' flat. Left the country very soon after the interrogation but returned in 1967 and confessed when confronted with Blunt's confession. * Jim Hill - liaison officer in the Australian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, access was restricted to classified information in 1949 on the basis of Venona project material, interrogated three times by Skardon in 1959, cleared and access restored.

The son of an early planter family in Mississippi, he became a member of the Democratic Party. Noel was elected to the state house, as a district attorney, and to the state senate before winning election as governor in 1907. As governor, he achieved gains in public education, child labor laws, and established a state charity hospital. After his tenure, he was re-elected to the state senate. Early life, family and education Edmond Favor Noel was born in 1856 on his family's cotton plantation in Holmes County, Mississippi near the city of Lexington, the third son of several children of Leland Noel and his wife Margaret Ann Sanders. Noel's father had become a successful cotton planter before the war. His mother was a daughter of a Virginia planter. The earliest Noel ancestor in America immigrated to the Virginia Colony in the 1660s from the Netherlands, where his French Huguenot (Protestant) ancestor had migrated because of religious persecution in France.Jennie Noel Weeks, The Emigrant Cornelius Noel, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints' Family History Center Edmond was named after his paternal uncle, Edmund Faver Noel, and in some records his name appears with the same spelling. His father Leland Noel had traveled with his brother Edmund to Mississippi in 1835, sent by their father as young unmarried men from their home plantation Paynefield in Essex County, Virginia. They were to develop a 1200-acre property their father had bought in Franklin. The brothers later purchased their own plantation properties in Holmes County and each married Southern women from their class. Together with a younger third brother, William L. Noel, who joined them, the three became major planters and slaveholders in the area. According to the 1860 Slave Schedules of the US Census, the three held 130 slaves in total that year; Leland held the most.\\"HOLMES COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI/ LARGEST SLAVEHOLDERS FROM 1860 SLAVE CENSUS SCHEDULES\\", Transcribed by Tom Blake, 2003, Rootsweb/Ancestry.com, accessed 22 December 2015 They cultivated extensive cotton plantations in Holmes County. Edmond's father Leland lost great wealth as a result of the Civil War, including his property in slaves. Rather than going to law school after college, his son Edmond Noel worked and 'read the law' with an established firm; when he was prepared, he passed the bar. He joined the Democratic Party. Political career When Noel entered politics, he was elected first to the Mississippi House of Representatives and later as a district attorney. In 1890 the Democratic-dominated legislature passed a new constitution with provisions that disenfranchised most African Americans by raising barriers to voter registration. White Democrats maintained this exclusion of blacks from politics through much of the 1960s in the state. These actions crippled the Republican Party in the state, whose members had been primarily made up of newly enfranchised African-American freedmen after the Civil War. In 1895 Noel was elected to the Mississippi State Senate. He served in the U.S. Army in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (1898). He was re-elected to the state senate in 1899. During his time in the State Senate, Noel authored Mississippi's primary election law, designed to exclude blacks from the Democratic Party primary. In 1902, Mississippi passed this law, which defined political parties as private organizations and therefore outside the authority of the 15th Amendment. Thereafter, the Mississippi Democratic Party excluded black citizens from membership and participation in its primaries. The \\"white primary,\\" a device soon imitated in laws passed in most other Southern states, \\"effectively prevented the small number of blacks registered to vote from having any say in who got elected to partisan offices--from the local sheriff to the governor and members of Congress.\\"\\"Race and Voting in the Segregated South\\", Constitutional Rights Foundation, 2015, accessed 28 December 2015 Noel also promoted a state constitutional amendment providing for an elected judiciary. In 1903 Noel tried to gain the party nomination for governor of Mississippi but was unsuccessful. By that time the disenfranchisement of blacks had resulted in a one-party Democratic state; the only competitive races in the state were the Democratic Party primaries; whoever won the primary was sure to win the general election. In 1907, Noel won the Democratic primary and was elected as Governor of Mississippi. He achieved numerous progressive reforms, including in education. These reforms included consolidation of the state's rural school districts, the establishment of agricultural high schools for whites, and the founding of a teacher's college in Hattiesburg (restricted to white students). Noel's administration also gained passage of laws regulating child labor, establishing statewide prohibition of alcohol, founding of a state charity hospital, and establishing pure food laws. The business community in Jackson had recommended that both the 66-year-old Governor's Mansion and the Old Capitol be demolished and the sites redeveloped for commercial use. Noel and his wife Alice worked together to promote preservation and renovation of the mansion. Through their efforts, it received its first major renovation and was updated for continued use. After the end of his term, Noel continued to be active in state politics. In 1918, he was unsuccessful in his run for the United States Senate, which was newly based on popular voting. Since adoption of the 17th Amendment in 1913, US senators were elected for the first time that year by popular vote rather than by state legislatures. Noel ranked third; both he and Pat Harrison lost to the incumbent, populist US Senator James K. Vardaman. Blacks were still effectively disenfranchised and excluded from voting. In 1920, Noel was elected again to the Mississippi State Senate, where he served until his death in 1927. Personal life and death Noel married Loula Hoskins in 1890. They had children together, including sons, before her death. Secondly, he married again in 1905, to young widow Alice Josephine (Tye) Neilson (1868-1933). She brought her two young sons, Halbert and Edwin, with her to the marriage.\\"Alice Tye Neilson\\", 1900 US Census, Beat 3, Holmes County, Mississippi; accessed 28 December 2015 She served as First Lady when Noel was governor.

Sansing, \\"Edmond Favor Noel: Thirty-seventh Governor of Mississippi: 1908-1912\\" , Mississippi History Now, 2004, accessed 28 December 2015 After his death in July 1927, Noel was buried at Odd Fellows Cemetery in Lexington, Mississippi.

Published in 1999, it begins where McCourt ended Angela's Ashes, his Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of his impoverished childhood in Ireland and his return to America. Synopsis The book begins as McCourt lands at Albany, New York, and quickly makes his way to New York City. Friendless and clueless about American customs, he struggles to integrate himself into American blue-collar society. He is then drafted into the US Army, sent to Europe, and rises to the rank of corporal. On his stay in Germany, he has confrontations with many people who try to show Frank how to get a Russian refugee girl to have sexual intercourse with him by giving her coffee or cigarettes. He is granted leave from the army as compensation for his exceptional service as a clerk-typist and goes back home to Ireland to see his family. He then decides to return to the US, where he attends New York University ‚Äì despite never having graduated from high school. He falls in love with and eventually marries a middle-class American-born girl, Alberta Small (nicknamed Mike), whom he meets at university. After graduating from NYU, he teaches English and social studies at McKee Vocational and Technical High School on Staten Island. There, he is forced to deal with apathetic, indifferent students. Eventually, he moves on to teaching at the prestigious Stuyvesant High School. At Stuyvesant, he revises his teaching style to end his reliance on books and other teaching resources, to become an effective teacher. 'Tis examines Frank's relationship to his family and his wife during this time (all his siblings and his mother move to America over the course of the book). Frank's father, who sometimes visits his children, is still drinking and his children will never forgive him totally. Eventually, Frank's relationship with his wife turns sour, and they stay together as long as they do only because of their daughter, Margaret Ann (named after Frank's sister who died in infancy, and his grandmother, who is described in Angela's Ashes). Nonetheless, Frank finally leaves them, an action he compares to that of his father leaving his family. Frank's mother, Angela McCourt, is in increasingly bad health due to emphysema and dies in New York around the same time as Frank's father, Malachy McCourt, Sr., dies in Ireland. Frank goes to Ireland to bury his father and scatter his mother's ashes. The book ends after Frank and his brothers scatter Angela's ashes over the graves of her family. \\"'Tis\\" was the final and only word of the last chapter of Angela's Ashes, while 'Tis ends with the spreading of Angela McCourt's ashes in Ireland. Frank McCourt has remarked in several interviews (perhaps joking) that he originally intended for each book to have the other's title. Frank McCourt followed this book with another memoir, Teacher Man. Character list Frank McCourt: The narrator and author of the book and an immigrant from Ireland, he has a deep love for literature and eventually goes on to marry Alberta after attending NYU. He taught as a school teacher for the latter part of his life, despite many offers to work for higher pay in the auto industry and loading docks. Alberta Smalls: Also known as \\"Mike\\" during her college years, she and Frank meet in college during one of their classes together. Although she had trouble dealing with Frank's frequent drinking problem, they push through together and eventually get married. Tom Clifford: A roommate of Frank's before he left for high school, Tom eventually leaves for Detroit to work in an auto factory, and urges Frank to join him. Frank declines, citing his desire to go to college as reason to stay. Margaret Ann: Named after Frank's sister, Margaret is presented to him with black marks on her feet which Frank mistakenly assumes is a birthmark. This ruins his imagining of his daughter running shoeless on the beach. Frank's brother Malachy speaks to Frank over the telephone and calls him 'an ass' - explaining that the hospital likely took footprints (instead of fingerprints).  Content and structure  The title of the book comes from the last sentence of the previous memoir, \\"Tis\\", an answer to a rhetorical question. The memoir has been criticized because it ignores McCourt's marriage to psychotherapist Cheryl Floyd.  Critical reception  L.S. Keep of Entertainment Weekly, described the memoir as a good successor of Angela's Ashes, concluding that \\"this book has the same clairvoyant eye for quirks of class, character, and fate, and also a distinct picaresque quality. It‚Äôs a quest for an America of wholesome Hollywood happiness that doesn‚Äôt exist, and it‚Äôs about the real America ‚Äî rendered with comic affection ‚Äî that McCourt discovers along the way. \\" Similarly, Margo Hammond of the St. Petersburg Times found the memoir a good read, though McCourt was unable to provide a satisfactory narrative arch to the work. Commenting for the public radio station WKMS, Jacque Day called the memoir \\"an exercise in humanity by a man with a rare gift for a story, and a brogue that sings on.\\"  References  Category:1999 American novels Category:Novels by Frank McCourt Category:Sequel novels Category:American memoirs ","title":"'Tis"},{"id":"923717","text":"Mas, M√°s or MAS may refer to: Film and TV * M√°s y Menos, fictional superhero characters, from the Teen Titans animated television series * \\"M√°s\\" (Breaking Bad), a season three episode of Breaking Bad Songs * M√°s (album), by Spanish singer Alejandro Sanz * \\"M√°s\\", by Jos√© Jos√© from the 1985 album Promesas * \\"M√°s\\", by Kinky from their 2002 album Kinky * \\"M√°s\\" (Nelly Furtado song), from her 2009 album Mi Plan * \\"M√°s\\" (Ricky Martin song), from his 2011 album M√∫sica + Alma + Sexo * \\"M√°s\\", by Selena G√≥mez from her 2014 album For You Computing * MAS 90, Sage accounting software * Motu Audio System, now Digital Performer, audio sequencer software * Multi-agent system, built of multiple interacting agents * Malware Analysis System by FireEye Education * Master of Advanced Studies, an academic degree * Master of Advanced Study, a professional degree * Master of Applied Science, a professional degree * Master of Archival Studies, a professional degree * Master of Aeronautical Science, a professional degree Military * MAS (boat), Italian motor torpedo boats * Manufacture d'armes de Saint-√âtienne, a French government arms factory ** MAS-49 rifle, a French semiautomatic rifle manufactured by them Organizations * Malaysia Airlines, flag carrier of Malaysia * Muerte a Secuestradores (Death to Kidnappers), a Colombian paramilitary group * Football Association of Malaysia, by FIFA report code * Mongolian Academy of Sciences, a Mongolian college * Municipal Art Society, an urban planning organization based in New York City * Muslim American Society, an Islamic revival and reform movement * Macarthur Astronomical Society, a non-profit organization based in Sydney, Australia * Monetary Authority of Singapore, Singapore's central bank * Museum aan de Stroom, museum in the city of Antwerp * Museo de Arte Moderno y Contempor√°neo de Santander y Cantabria, art museum in Santander, Spain * MAS Fez, a Moroccan football club Places * Mas de las Matas, Arag√≥n, Spain * Mas (Proven√ßal farmhouse) * Mas (restaurant), New York City Politics * Movement for Socialism (Argentina) (Movimiento al Socialismo), an Argentine political party * Mouvement pour une Alternative Socialiste (Movement for a Socialist Alternative), a Belgian Trotskyist organization * Movement toward Socialism (Bolivia) (Movimiento al Socialismo), a Bolivian political party * Broad Social Movement (Movimiento Amplio Social), a Chilean political party * Socialist Alternative Movement (Movimento Alternativa Socialista), a Portuguese Trotskyist political party * Movement toward Socialism (Venezuela) (Movimiento al Socialismo), a Venezuelan political party Biology * Macrophage activation syndrome, a potentially life-threatening complication of several chronic rheumatic diseases of childhood * The G protein-coupled receptor Mas, a critical part of the renin‚Äìangiotensin‚Äìaldosterone system (RAAS), encoded by the proto-oncogene MAS1 * Mandibular advancement splint, a device used to treat sleep apnea * Marker assisted selection, a genome-tagging technique * Meconium aspiration syndrome, neonatal aspiration of meconium * McCune‚ÄìAlbright syndrome, a genetic disorder which results in precocious puberty * Mixed amphetamine salts, an abridged generic name for Adderall, a stimulant drug Metrics * Milliampere second (mAs), a fraction of an ampere hour, a unit of electric charge * Milliarcseconds (mas), a unit of angular measurement * Magic angle spinning, a technique used in solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Transport * Chennai Central railway station, code MAS People * Mas (surname), a surname * Mas (Swedish term) * MAS (band) * Marco Antonio Solis, name abbreviation Other uses * Malaysia, IOC country code. * Mas, short for masquerade, traditional Carnival costumes; see List of Trinidad and Tobago Carnival character costumes See also * Mezzi d'Assalto, (Assault Vehicle), in the unit name Decima Flottiglia MAS ","title":"Mas"},{"id":"923721","text":"First edition (publ. Viking Press) Homer Price is the title character in two children's books written by Robert McCloskey. Homer Price was published in 1943, and Centerburg Tales in 1951. Characters Homer lives in Centerburg, Ohio. He is a mild-mannered boy who enjoys fixing radios, and who somehow gets involved in a series of outrageous incidents, such as tending an inexplicably unstoppable doughnut-making machine in his uncle's diner, or caring for mystery plants that turn out to be a giant form of allergy-inducing ragweed. He does odd jobs like raking leaves, and sweeping up the diner or the nearby barber shop. His main job is helping out in his father's business, a motor court, where Homer also resides. James Daugherty said of Homer Price, \\"It is America laughing at itself with a broad and genial humanity, without bitterness or sourness or sophistication.\\"Robert McCloskey, 1914-2003 One of Homer Price's adventures, \\"The Case of the Cosmic Comic\\", parodies the Superman phenomenon, with Homer and his best friend Freddy attending the local personal appearance of Freddy's favorite superhero. Freddy is unable to understand that \\"The Super-Duper\\" is an ordinary actor in a costume, and expects him to be capable of super feats. Homer, however, quietly displays a more mature view of the hero. Another adventure of Homer's is when an adult friend of his in Centerburg wins a contest for composing an advertising jingle for shaving lotion, but the prize money is stolen on the air by an armed robbery. By chance, the robbers are staying at the same motor court, and Homer sees it as his chance to stop them and claim a cash reward in order to build all sorts of radios and (at the time) an expensive television. Although Homer is eager to profit from the reward, he is also genuinely interested in bringing the robbers to justice as they stole from a man he knew. Flim-flam merchants and larger-than-life paraphernalia appear in several stories. One features a snake-oil salesman‚ÄîProfessor Atmos P. H. Ear‚Äîoffloading an odorless, colorless, tasteless chemical called \\"Ever-So-Much-More-So\\" that when sprinkled on things, supposedly enhances everything; a soft bed would become softer, a fast car becomes faster, and so on. Many of the male residents of Centerburg share first names with classical figures; \\"Grandpa Hercules\\", \\"Uncle Ulysses\\", \\"Uncle Telemachus\\", and Homer himself. Miss Terwilliger is a comely and likeable spinster who loves to knit. Both the sheriff and Uncle \\"Telly\\" Telemachus want to marry Miss Terwilliger, but she is unable to decide which of them she likes better. Eventually the two bachelors hold a contest to see who has the largest ball of string, with the winner getting to marry Miss Terwilliger. She ends up beating them both with her collection of saved yarn, but still marries Uncle Telly, who came in second. African-American characters appear in the books, portrayed positively as ordinary citizens. During a centennial celebration of Centerburg, a chorus from the African Baptist Church provides music, although the drawing of the boy who finds the diamond bracelet in the donut is drawn in decidedly tattered and patched clothing. Stories =Homer Price= 1\\\\. \\"The Case of the Sensational Scent\\" The first thing Homer hears upon assembling his new homemade radio is news of a robbery. He and his pet skunk meet the robbers the next day, and the encounter leads to their identification. 2\\\\. \\"The Case of the Cosmic Comic\\" Homer and Freddy meet their comic book hero, the Super-Duper (a pastiche of Superman), when he appears in person at the Centerburg movie theater, but unintentionally learn an uncomfortable truth about him. 3\\\\. \\"The Doughnuts\\" Uncle Ulysses installs a new doughnut maker at his lunchroom in downtown Centerburg. Homer takes a special order from a wealthy customer while his uncle is out. Not only is it enough to feed everyone in town, but the doughnut maker malfunctions, churning them out at an unmanageable pace. 4\\\\. \\"Mystery Yarn\\" Homer's Uncle Telly and the local sheriff are rivals for two things: the hand of a local widow, and the title of World's Greatest String Saver. The contest becomes a County Fair event, heightened when the widow herself enters with a ball of scrap yarn. 5\\\\. \\"Nothing New under the Sun (Hardly)\\" A stranger with the proverbial \\"better mousetrap\\" arrives in Centerburg, offering his services to the town. 6\\\\. \\"Wheels of Progress\\" Centerburg holds its yearly pageant, as the locals celebrate both their history and a new, modern subdivision of prefabricated houses.

Two generations of the EV model were sold in California, and to fleets elsewhere in the US, with a gap of almost ten years between them. The first generation was leased from 1997 to 2003, and at the lessees' request, many units were sold after the vehicle was discontinued. A total of 1,484 were leased and/or sold in California to meet the state's mandate for zero-emissions vehicle. A small number were sold or leased in fleet sales in other states. As of mid-2012, there were almost 500 vehicles still in use in California. Production of the second generation EV was limited to 2,600 units during a three-year run, with sales limited to California beginning in 2012. Production ended in September 2014. A total of 2,489 units of the second generation model were sold in California through April 2015. Toyota worked together with Tesla Motors to develop the second generation RAV4 EV, and the electric SUV was released in the United States in September 2012. The US Environmental Protection Agency rated the second generation RAV4 EV with a combined range of and a combined fuel economy rating of 76 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (). First generation The first fleet version of the RAV4 EV became available on a limited basis in 1997. In 2001 it was possible for businesses, cities or utilities to lease one or two of these cars. Toyota then actually sold or leased 328 RAV4 EVs to the general public in 2003, at which time the program was terminated despite waiting lists of prospective customers. The RAV4 EV closely resembles the regular internal combustion engine (ICE) version - without a tailpipe - and has a governed top speed of 78 mph (~126 km/h) with an EPA rated range of . The 95 amp-hour NiMH battery pack has a capacity of 27 kWh, charges inductively and has proven to be very durable. Some RAV4 EVs have been driven more than using the original battery pack. It was also one of the few vehicles with a single speed gearbox when introduced to the market. Beyond the unusual power train (batteries, controller and motor), the remaining systems in the RAV4 EV are comparable to the gasoline-powered RAV4. The power brakes, power steering, tire wear and suspension components are similar except that they use electric power sources. The power brakes use an electric pump to provide vacuum instead of deriving vacuum from the engine manifold. The power steering use an electric motor instead of mechanical energy delivered by fan belts. The passenger compartment is heated and cooled electrically using a heat pump (the first fleet application of a heat pump in a road vehicle) with supplemental electrical resistance heating as backup. =Performance= The RAV4 EV production has a governed top speed of , a tested 0-60 mph (97 km/h) time of around 18 seconds (depending on state-of-charge on the batteries). Its EPA rated driving range is with an EPA combined fuel economy rating of 43 kW¬∑h/100 mi (equivalent to 78 MPGe). Actual fuel economy and range depends on the same factors as a traditional gasoline-powered vehicle including rolling resistance and average speed (aerodynamic drag). The RAV4 EV battery pack uses 24 12-volt, 95Ah NiMH batteries capable of storing 27 kWh of energy. =Charging= The RAV4 EV's batteries can be recharged from being fully depleted to fully charged in about five hours, and are monitored with a passive battery balancing system. Electricity is supplied via a Magne Charge inductive charging paddle from a wall-mounted 6000-Watt charging unit on a 240 volt, 30 amp, North American \\"clothes dryer\\"-type plug. Some earlier RAV4 EV prototypes were charged via a front fender conductive charger coupling made by Yazaki Corporation. =Mileage costs= Charging a RAV4 EV from full-dead to full-charge uses approximately 30 kW¬∑h of electricity; the excess above the battery pack capacity is used by the charging system. At a rate of per kilowatt-hour, this costs around . As of May 2008, based on a gasoline price-per-gallon cost of and up and the non-EV 2003 RAV4 2-wheel-drive gasoline fuel efficiency of , the RAV4 EV costs approximately 20% as much on a per mile basis, and makes mileage in the RAV4 EV the cost equivalent to a small SUV. In addition, the RAV4 EV has a charge timer built into the dashboard that enables the vehicle to start charging at a specific time. As the RAV4 EV easily becomes the main cost of electricity in an average-sized home, this enables the owner to use a Time-Of-Day Meter to reduce electricity costs. This configuration is a standard practice with RAV4 EV owners. The price of electricity at night depends on the carrier, but is usually in the range of 60% of the normal rate. In the use of charging the RAV4 EV, this equates to a cheaper cost-per-mile, roughly equivalent to a vehicle capable of , based on a price of per gallon. The United States Environmental Protection Agency listed mileage ratings for the RAV4 EV in its yearly Fuel Economy Guide from 2000 through 2003. The 2003 model recorded fuel efficiency of 39 kW¬∑h/100 mi city, 49 kW¬∑h/100 mi highway; the city mileage rating was equivalent to , and on the highway. The EPA rated combined mileage was . In 2007, the EPA updated its rating system and revised the ratings to a city equivalent of , highway equivalent of , and a combined equivalent of . =Consumable items= The RAV4 EV's battery system is a consumable item. Toyota reports that battery pack replacement costs are currently higher than the value of the used vehicle. Toyota tested the RAV4 EV in Japan for over two years before introducing the vehicle in the United States. The economies of scale are affecting the replacement cost of the RAV4 EV. =Prototyping= RAV4 EV pre-production prototypes were first released in a confidential evaluation program with electric utilities throughout the U.S. These prototypes were based on the smaller, shorter, two-door version of the RAV4. The prototypes included some versions fitted with Panasonic NiMH batteries, and others with high-performance Panasonic lead‚Äìacid PbA batteries (the same ones that eventually found their way into the EV1 and other production GM electric vehicles). The RAV4 EV prototypes also were equipped with on-board level 2 chargers and connected via a front fender conductive charger coupling made by Yazaki Corporation. Both prototypes were well accepted. The utility employee evaluators did not have to personally pay for the more costly and advanced NiMH batteries, and the NiMH RAV4 EV prototype received better reviews, due to its increased range. Its energy efficiency, however, was not as good as the PbA version. Due to the impracticality of developing two battery types for a limited volume program, Toyota opted for the higher-performance, higher-cost NiMH RAV4 EV. This resulted in a greater manufacturing cost, and higher purchase price. A number of electric vehicle advocates voiced disappointment that the choice was made to manufacture only the NiMH version. Many electric vehicle advocates claim that automaker's choice of the NiMH battery worked against the 90's deployment of cost- effective electric vehicles based on PbA batteries, and that further development of lead‚Äìacid technology could result in performance equal to NiMH, but at a substantially lower price. Their argument is that a usable electric vehicle is possible at a substantially lower price, and that the lower purchase price would foster greater acceptance of electric vehicles. =Corporate purchasing= Initially, RAV4 EVs were only available for three- year fleet lease, not for sale and not for lease to the public, at a few dealerships beginning in 1997. From 2001, leases were made available to small \\"fleets of one\\" purportedly run by small businesses. =Public availability= Rear view of one of the 328 RAV4 EVs available to the public. In March 2002, due to a shift in corporate policy, the Toyota RAV4-EV was made available for sale to the general public. All 328 that Toyota made were sold. No one knows for certain what prompted Toyota to change their position on the RAV4-EV, since they had long since fulfilled their obligations under the MOA with the California Air Resources Board's zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate via its fleet lease program. The MSRP was ; but in California, ZIP-grant rebates of , decreasing in 2003 to , and a credit from the Internal Revenue Service brought the price down to a more palatable ( for some 2003 deliveries), including the home charger. More RAV4-EVs were sold than had been planned for manufacture through standard assembly line techniques. Toyota filled every order despite the fact that the last few dozen vehicles had to be assembled from spare parts due to a shortfall of production components (a significantly more expensive way of building a vehicle). This unexpected development caused deliveries to trickle on into September 2003. It also caused variations in the vehicles such as heated seats, retractable antennae, mats, etc. The last of the 328 EVs was sold in November 2002. =Sales= A total of 1,484 were leased and/or sold in California. =Chevron Patent Encumbrance= Whether or not Toyota wanted to continue production, it was unlikely to be able to do so because the EV-95 battery was no longer available. Chevron had inherited control of the worldwide patent rights for the NiMH EV-95 battery when it merged with Texaco, which had purchased them from General Motors. Chevron's unit won a settlement from Toyota and Panasonic, and the production line for the large NiMH batteries was closed down and dismantled. This case was settled in the ICC International Court of Arbitration, and not publicized due to a gag order placed on Toyota. Only smaller NiMH batteries, incapable of powering an electric vehicle or plugging in, were allowed by Chevron-Texaco. Second generation The second generation RAV4 EV was released in September 2012 starting at a price of before any government incentives. Toyota also offered a 36-month lease option at per month with down payment of . The RAV4 EV was sold only in California, and sales began in the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles/Orange County and San Diego. Production was limited to 2,600 during three years. The RAV4 EV was available to individual consumers and fleet customers. Due to the capacity of its battery pack the RAV4 EV qualified for the maximum federal tax credit and also was eligible for a rebate in California. A total of 192 units were sold during 2012 and 1,096 during 2013. A total of 2,489 units were sold in the U.S. through April 2015. See section \\"November 2014 Battery Electric Car Sales Numbers\\" A total of 17 RAV4 EVs and 1 Honda Fit EV were sold during the first four months of 2015. The production run ended in September 2014. =History= The first prototype was built in just three weeks after the signing of a Tesla and Toyota joint development agreement, and testing began in July 2010. A second generation RAV4 EV demonstrator was unveiled at the November 2010 Los Angeles Auto Show. Toyota built 35 of these converted RAV4s (Phase Zero vehicles) for a demonstration and evaluation program that ran through 2011. The lithium metal-oxide battery and other power train components were supplied by Tesla Motors. The re- engineered RAV4 EV production version (Phase One vehicle) was unveiled at the May 2012 International Electric Vehicle Symposium in Los Angeles. The second generation RAV4 EV production models use the SAE J1772 charging standard, Early prototypes had a lithium-ion battery pack with a 50 kWh total capacity, 37 kWh usable, and achieved a range of between . The RAV4 EV battery pack, electronics and powertrain components in the production version are similar to those in used in the Tesla Model S sedan launched in June 2012, and the Phase Zero vehicles used components from the Tesla Roadster (2008). =Powertrain= The second generation RAV4 EV combines a Tesla-designed and produced battery and electric powertrain with Toyota's SUV model. The electric motor supplied by Tesla is an AC induction motor, a departure from Toyota's practice of using synchronous permanent-magnet motors in their hybrid electric vehicles. A fixed-gear open-differential transaxle has a gear ratio of 9.73. The RAV4 EV weighs , heavier than a front-wheel drive RAV4 Limited with the V-6 engine. The RAV 4 offers two drive modes: Normal and Sport. Peak power output of the motor is , with peak torque in normal mode of , and peak torque in sport mode of . Maximum vehicle speed in Normal mode is , and maximum in Sport mode, which also has a more aggressive accelerator pedal feel, is . The US Environmental Protection Agency rated the RAV4 EV combined fuel economy at 76 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (), with an equivalent in city driving and on highways. =Battery and range= The battery pack is a 386 V lithium- ion battery pack comprising about 4,500 cells and rated at 41.8 kW¬∑h of usable energy at full charge, with a maximum power output of 129 kW. The RAV4 EV features a 10 kW onboard charger (SAE J1772 240 V, 40 A input). The battery pack is located below the floorpan, reducing the ground clearance as compared with the gasoline-powered version by a couple of inches, but the electric SUV's cargo space of is the same as its gasoline sibling. The battery pack weighs and because it is located in the lowest part of the vehicle, the lower center of gravity provides a better handling than the conventional Toyota RAV4. Toyota electric car badge used in the RAV4 EV The RAV4 EV has two charge modes: Standard and Extended. In standard mode, the high voltage battery charges only up to 35 kWh and Toyota expected the electric SUV to achieve an EPA driving range rating of for this charging mode. Extended mode allows the battery to charge to its full usable capacity of 41.8 kWh, providing an expected EPA driving range of according to Toyota estimates. The EPA rated just one range of . Standard mode is designed to optimize battery life over range; however, the 8-year, 100,000-mile battery warranty cover the packs regardless of the mix of charge modes over the pack's life. However, due to EPA's procedures, Toyota expects the Monroney label to show the combined range of . Charging time with a 40 A/240 V charging station is 5 hours in Standard Mode and 6 hours for Extended Mode; the onboard charger delivers 9.6 kW at 40 amperes input, which yields a recharge time of just 6 hours for Extended Mode. Toyota had arranged with Leviton to offer a custom level 2 charging station priced at including basic installation. On the other end of the scale, and due to its large battery pack, charging at 110 volts with the cord that comes standard under the rear deck takes 44 hours for Standard Mode and 52 hours for Extended Mode. An aftermarket company called Quick Charge Power shop.QuickChargePower.com has come up with a way to add 48 kW CHAdeMO DC Quick Charging to the RAV4ev which dramatically shortens charge times for the 41.8 kWh battery. This can make the car tremendously more useful in areas where this charging infrastructure exists. =Production= Since May 2010, Toyota Motor Company and Tesla Motors worked together to develop the second generation RAV4 EV using Tesla's electric motor and batteries and Toyota's platform and body. The electric SUV was developed by Tesla and Toyota Technical Center U.S.A. in Michigan. On July 15, 2011, Tesla entered into a supply and services agreement with Toyota for the supply of a validated electric powertrain system, including a battery, charging system, inverter, motor, gearbox and associated software, which would be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the Toyota RAV4.Tesla scores $100 million Toyota RAV4 EV-related contract The RAV4 EV began assembly in 2012 at Toyota's facility in Woodstock, Ontario alongside the regular gasoline version. Tesla builds the electric powertrain at its plant at Tesla Factory in Fremont, California, and then ships them to Canada. The battery supply deal between Toyota and Tesla concluded with the end of production in August 2014.

The story follows two friends who need to win at high-stakes poker to quickly pay off a large debt. The term \\"rounder\\" refers to a person traveling around from city to city seeking high-stakes card games. Rounders opened to mixed reviews and earned only a modest box office. With the poker boom in the early 2000s, the film later became a cult hit.  Plot  New York City law student and gifted poker player Mike McDermott (Matt Damon) dreams of winning the World Series of Poker. At an underground Texas hold 'em game run by Russian mobster Teddy \\"KGB\\" (John Malkovich), an overconfident Mike loses his entire $30,000 bankroll in a single hand. Shaken, he promises his girlfriend and fellow student Jo (Gretchen Mol) he has quit poker, and concentrates on law school. His mentor Joey Knish (John Turturro) offers to stake him to rebuild his bankroll but Mike declines, and instead accepts a part-time job to make ends meet. Several months pass and Mike stays true to his promise until his childhood friend Lester \\"Worm\\" Murphy (Edward Norton) is released from prison. While Mike is an honest player, Worm is a hustler and unapologetic cheat. To help Worm pay off a debt, Mike sets him up with games across town, and reluctantly sits in on a game, interfering with his studies and his relationship with Jo. Mike allows Worm to play on his credit at the Chesterfield Club; however, Worm takes out $10,000 and begins a tab in Mike's name. Worm runs into Grama (Michael Rispoli), a dangerous pimp, who has bought Worm‚Äôs debt ‚Äì Worm now owes $25,000 directly to Grama, who is working for KGB. Grama takes Worm‚Äôs $10,000, threatening him to pay the rest. As Mike returns to his poker lifestyle and friends, Jo ends their relationship. Mike learns from Petra (Famke Janssen) at the Chesterfield that Worm has racked up a $6,000 debt in Mike‚Äôs name. In Atlantic City, Worm tells Mike about his debt to Grama but withholds that he is working for KGB. Mike proposes to Grama that Worm pay weekly installments; Grama considers the offer but also mocks Worm for his inability to pay him. Worm responds by insulting Grama and as the two nearly come to blows, Mike defuses the situation by agreeing to vouch for Worm and an angry Grama gives them five days to pay the remaining $15,000. Mike decides to help Worm win the money by playing in several games in and around the city. On a winning streak, Mike earns $7,200 in three days, but still needs to double it in 48 hours. Worm directs Mike to an out-of-town game hosted by New York state troopers, where he wins almost the full $15,000 before Worm unexpectedly joins the game. The officers catch Worm base-dealing to help Mike; they are beaten up and relieved of their entire bankroll. Worm finally confesses that Grama is working for KGB. With their lives in danger, Worm decides to flee, but Mike returns to the city, cutting ties with Worm. Mike asks Grama for more time, to no avail. Mike asks Knish for the money but is refused out of principle. During the conversation with Knish, Mike reveals his motivation for taking the ill-fated risk at KGB's club and why he thinks he can compete and possibly win the World Series of Poker. He even quotes Worm saying that Knish \\"sees all the angles but doesn't have the stones to play any\\" after Knish had already refused to help financially. Desperate, Mike asks his law school professor Petrovsky (Martin Landau), who loans him $10,000. Mike challenges KGB to a second heads-up, No-Limit Texas Hold'em game for the remaining debt, with winner-take-all stakes, which KGB accepts. Mike beats KGB in the first session, winning $20,000. KGB offers to let Mike‚Äôs winnings \\"ride\\" and continue the game, but Mike ‚Äì with enough to pay off most of his debts ‚Äì declines. As he is about to leave, KGB taunts Mike that he is paying him with the money he lost to KGB from their previous game. Mike changes his mind and decides to continue playing. Mike doubles the blinds at the risk of losing everything to KGB again, and possibly his life. As the night wears on, Mike spots KGB's tell and folds, deducing KGB has a better hand. Irate at the missed chance to win it all, KGB begins to play on \\"tilt\\". In the final hand, Mike baits a boastful KGB into going all-in, and defeats him with a nut straight. KGB throws a tantrum at having been lured into a mistake. Despite Grama‚Äôs urging, KGB, rattled, calls off his goons and admits Mike won fairly, allowing him to leave with his winnings. With over $60,000, Mike settles Worm‚Äôs $15,000 debt to Grama, the Chesterfield‚Äôs $6,000 credit, Petrovsky‚Äôs $10,000 loan, and restores his original bankroll of \\"three stacks of high society.\\" Mike drops out of law school, says goodbye to Jo, and leaves New York for Las Vegas to play in the World Series of Poker.  Cast  * Matt Damon as Mike McDermott * Edward Norton as Lester \\"Worm\\" Murphy * John Turturro as Joey Knish, character inspired by wry underground poker player Joel \\"Bagels\\" Rosenberg * John Malkovich as Teddy KGB * Famke Janssen as Petra * Michael Rispoli as Grama * Martin Landau as Abe Petrovsky * Gretchen Mol as Jo * Paul Cicero as Russian Thug * Melina Kanakaredes as Barbara * Josh Mostel as Zagosh * Tom Aldredge as Judge Marinacci * Lenny Clarke as Savino * Chris Messina as Higgins * Goran Vi≈°njiƒá as Maurice * David Zayas as Osborne * Johnny Chan as himself * Bill Camp as Eisenberg * Josh Pais as Weitz * Adam LeFerve as Sean Frye  Production  = Filming = Principal photography for Rounders began in December 1997; it took place mostly in New York. Exceptions include the law school scenes (filmed at Rutgers School of Law- Newarkhttps://www.newarkhappening.com/things-to-do/music-entertainment/film- spots/) and the State Trooper poker game and parking lot scenes (filmed at the B.P.O Elks Lodge in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey).  Reception  = Box office = Rounders was released on September 11, 1998, in 2,176 theaters and grossed $8.5 million during its opening weekend. It went on to make $22.9 million domestically. = Critical response = Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote: \\"Rounders sometimes has a noir look but it never has a noir feel, because it's not about losers (or at least it doesn't admit it is). It's essentially a sports picture, in which the talented hero wins, loses, faces disaster, and then is paired off one last time against the champ.\\" In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote: \\"Though John Dahl's Rounders finally adds up to less than meets the eye, what does meet the eye (and ear) is mischievously entertaining.\\" USA Today gave the film three out of four stars and wrote: \\"The card playing is well-staged, and even those who don't know a Texas hold-'em ('the Cadillac of poker') from a Texas hoedown will get a vicarious charge out of the action.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \\"B\\" rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, \\"Norton, cast in what might have once been the Sean Penn role (hideous shirts, screw-you attitude), gives Worm a shifty, amphetamine soul and a pleasing alacrity ... Norton's performance never really goes anywhere, but that's okay, since the story is just an excuse to lead the characters from one poker table to the next.\\" Peter Travers, in his review for Rolling Stone said of John Malkovich's performance: \\"Of course, no one could guess the extent to which Malkovich is now capable of chewing scenery. He surpasses even his eyeballrolling as Cyrus the Virus in Con Air. Munching Oreo cookies, splashing the pot with chips (a poker no-no) and speaking with a Russian accent that defies deciphering (\\"Ho-kay, Meester sum of a beech\\"), Malkovich soars so far over the top, he's passing Pluto.\\" In his review for the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle said of Damon's performance: \\"Mike should supply the drive the film otherwise lacks, and Damon doesn't. We might believe he can play cards, but we don't believe he needs to do it, in the way, say, that the 12-year-old Mozart needed to write symphonies. He's not consumed with genius. He's a nice guy with a skill.\\" In his review for The Globe and Mail, Liam Lacey wrote: \\"The main problem with Rounders is that the movie never quite knows what it is about: What is the moral ante?\\" Despite an unremarkable theatrical release, Rounders has a following, particularly among poker enthusiasts. There are pro poker players who credit the film for getting them into the game. The film drew in successful players such as Brian Rast, Hevad Khan, Gavin Griffin, and Dutch Boyd. Vanessa Rousso has said of the film's influence: \\"There have been lots of movies that have included poker, but only Rounders really captures the energy and tension in the game. And that's why it stands as the best poker movie ever made.\\"  References   External links    Category:1998 films Category:1990s buddy films Category:1998 drama films Category:1998 independent films Category:American films Category:American buddy drama films Category:American independent films Category:Films scored by Christopher Young Category:Films about the Russian Mafia Category:Films directed by John Dahl Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in Atlantic City, New Jersey Category:Films shot in New York (state) Category:Films shot in New Jersey Category:Films shot in Newark, New Jersey Category:Miramax films Category:American neo-noir films Category:Poker films ","title":"Rounders (film)"},{"id":"923762","text":"The phrase merger doctrine or doctrine of merger may refer to one of several legal doctrines: * Merger doctrine (antitrust law) * Merger doctrine (civil procedure) * Merger doctrine (copyright law) * The merger doctrine in criminal law of lesser included offenses * Merger doctrine (family law) * Merger doctrine (property law) * Merger doctrine (trust law) Category:Legal doctrines and principles ","title":"Merger doctrine"},{"id":"923766","text":"John Daly may refer to: Entertainment * John Charles Daly (1914‚Äì1991), American radio and television newsman and host of the TV panel game show What's My Line? * John Daly (producer) (1937‚Äì2008), British movie producer and director of The Big Bang * John Daly (Irish TV presenter), Northern Irish chat show host Politics * John Corry Wilson Daly (1796‚Äì1878), first mayor of Stratford, Ontario * John Daly (Irish Member of Parliament) (1834‚Äì1888), Irish Nationalist Member of Parliament for Cork City * John Daly (Fenian) (1845‚Äì1916), Irish revolutionary and member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood * John Daly (Irish politician) (1867‚Äì1932), represented Cork in the 1920s * John Daly (Australian politician) (1891‚Äì1942), Australian lawyer and politician * J.

Among the most damaged areas were Greater London, the East Anglian coast, the Home Counties, the west of Brittany and the Cotentin Peninsula of Normandy, all of which weathered gusts typically with a return period of 1 in 200 years. Forests, parks, roads and railways were strewn with fallen trees as well as schools being closed. The British National Grid suffered heavy damage, leaving thousands without power. At least 22 people were killed in England and France. The highest measured gust of was recorded at Pointe Du Roc, Granville, France and the highest gust in the UK of was recorded at Gorleston-on-Sea. The storm has been termed a weather bomb due to its rapid development. That day's weather reports had failed to indicate a storm of such severity, an earlier, correct forecast having been negated by later projections. The apparent suggestion by the BBC's Michael Fish of a false alarm is celebrated as a classic gaffe, though he claims he was misquoted. As a result of this storm, major improvements were later implemented in atmospheric observation, relevant computer models, and the training of forecasters. Development Partially cleared storm damage, Chelmsford On the Sunday before the storm struck, the farmers' forecast had predicted bad weather on the following Thursday or Friday, 15‚Äì16 October. By midweek, however, guidance from weather prediction models was somewhat equivocal. Instead of stormy weather over a considerable part of the UK, the models suggested that severe weather would reach no farther north than the English Channel and coastal parts of southern England. During the afternoon of 15 October, winds were very light over most parts of the UK. The pressure gradient was slack. A depression was drifting slowly northwards over the North Sea off eastern Scotland. A trough lay over England, Wales and Ireland. Over the Bay of Biscay, a depression was developing. = First warnings = The first gale warnings for sea areas in the English Channel were issued at 0630 UTC on 15 October and were followed, four hours later, by warnings of severe gales. At 1200 UTC on 15 October, the depression, which originated in the Bay of Biscay, was centred near 46¬∞ N, 9¬∞ W and its depth was 970 mb. By 1800 UTC, it had moved north-east to about 47¬∞ N, 6¬∞ W, and deepened to 964 mb. At 2235 UTC, winds of Force 10 were forecast. By midnight, the depression was over the western English Channel, and its central pressure was 953 mb. At 0140 on 16 October, warnings of Force 11 were issued. The depression now moved rapidly north-east, filling a little as it did, reaching the Humber Estuary at about 0530 UTC, by which time its central pressure was 959 mb. Dramatic increases in temperature were associated with the passage of the storm's warm front. In some sea areas, warnings of severe weather were both timely and adequate, although forecasts for land areas left much to be desired. During the evening of 15 October, radio and TV forecasts mentioned strong winds, but indicated that heavy rain would be the main feature, rather than wind. By the time most people went to bed, exceptionally strong winds had not been mentioned in national radio and TV weather broadcasts. Warnings of severe weather had been issued, however, to various agencies and emergency authorities, including the London Fire Brigade. Perhaps the most important warning was issued by the Met Office to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) at 0135 UTC, 16 October. It warned that the anticipated consequences of the storm were such that civil authorities might need to call on assistance from the military. =Winds= Storm damaged building, Barton on Sea in Hampshire A highest gust of is estimated from satellite data at Quimper, Brittany, with the highest measured gust at at Pointe du Roc, Granville, Normandy. In south-east England, where the greatest damage occurred, gusts of or more were recorded continually for three or four consecutive hours. During this time, the wind veered from southerly to south-westerly. To the north-west of this region, there were two maxima in gust speeds, separated by a period of lower wind speeds. During the first period, the wind direction was southerly. During the latter, it was south-westerly. Damage patterns in south-east England suggested that tornadoes accompanied the storm. In the UK, winds at Shoreham-by-Sea, Sussex reached before the anemometer failed. Many anemometers were reliant on mains power, and ceased recording as the south east of the United Kingdom was blacked-out by power cuts, thus losing much valuable data. Winds with an estimated 200-year return period hit the counties of Kent, Sussex, Hampshire and along the coastal strip of Essex, Suffolk and South Eastern Norfolk. North of a line from Portland Bill, Dorset to Cromer, Norfolk the return period of the respective gusts were under 10 years. Sustained winds speeds greater than 75 mph were recorded for over an hour in southern Britain. According to the Beaufort scale of wind intensities, this storm had winds of hurricane force 12 (73 mph or greater); as the term hurricane refers to tropical cyclones originating in the North Atlantic or North Pacific, the descriptor \\"great storm\\" has tended to be reserved for those storms in recent years reaching this velocity. Hurricanes have a very different wind profile and distribution from storms, and significantly higher precipitation levels. Impact =United Kingdom= Storm damage in London The storm made landfall in Cornwall, and tracked north-east towards Devon and then over the Midlands, going out to sea via The Wash. The strongest gusts, of up to , were recorded along the south-eastern edge of the storm, hitting mainly Hampshire, Sussex, Essex and Kent. The Royal Sovereign lighthouse off Eastbourne recorded wind speeds on its instruments at the highest velocity it could measure, . The storm caused substantial damage over much of England, felling an estimated 15 million trees (including six of the seven eponymous oaks in Sevenoaks, historic specimens in Kew Gardens, Wakehurst Place, Nymans Garden, Hyde Park, London and Scotney CastleThese much-visited gardens were noted in an editorial in Horticulture: The Magazine of American Gardening, November 1988:13. and most of the trees making up Chanctonbury Ring). At Bedgebury National Pinetum, Kent almost a quarter of the trees were brought down. There have been many claims that the damage to forestry was made worse by broadleaf trees still being in leaf at the time of the storm, though this was not borne out by an analysis by the Forestry Commission. Fallen trees blocked roads and railways and left widespread structural damage primarily to windows and roofs. Several hundred thousand people were left without power, not fully restored until more than two weeks later. Local electric utility officials later said they lost more wires in the storm than in the preceding decade. At sea, as well as many small boats being wrecked, a Sealink cross-channel ferry, the MV Hengist, was driven ashore at Folkestone and the bulk carrier MV Sumnea capsized at Dover, Kent. The National Grid sustained heavy damage during the event, as crashing cables short-circuited, which in some cases overheated the main system. Its headquarters faced the choice of keeping the Grid online to help London as the storm approached but risk an incremental system breakdown, failure and burnout, or to shut down most of South East England including London and avert that risk. The headquarters made the decision, the first one like it since before World War II: to shut down the South East power systems to maintain the network as soon as signs of overheating began. In London, many of the trees lining streets, particularly plane trees, were blown down overnight, blocking roads and crushing parked cars. Building construction scaffolding and billboards collapsed in many places, and many buildings were damaged. The following morning, the BBC's largest broadcasting site, Lime Grove Studios in White City, was unable to function due to a power failure ‚Äî ITV's TV-am and BBC1's Breakfast Time programmes were broadcast from different emergency facilities in emergency formats. TV-am broadcast from Thames Television's Euston Road studios, while BBC newsreader Nicholas Witchell had to broadcast from the BBC1 continuity studio at BBC Television Centre, with the wall decorations used for Children's BBC hastily taken down. Much of the public transport in the capital was not functioning, and people were advised against trying to go to work. TV-am host Anne Diamond did go back to the regular TV-am studio with reporter Kay Burley, whilst Richard Keys remained in the Thames Television studio in case the power supply situation became even worse, and indeed, power did go back down at around 8:15am. =France= The d√©partements of Finist√®re, Morbihan, C√¥tes-d'Armor and Ille-et-Vilaine in Brittany, and the Cotentin Peninsula (Manche and part of Calvados) in Normandy were the areas in France most affected by the storm, which followed a line from Morbihan and Rennes to Deauville. 1.79 million homes were left without electricity supply and water, and a quarter of Brittany's forest was destroyed. The total damage was estimated at ‚Ç£23 billion. M√©t√©o France announced \\"\\" (a little storm coming in from the Azores), which reached Brittany's coast at about 18:00, later than expected. This depression caused little damage, with only winds. A much deeper depression hit Ushant on the extreme western tip of Brittany at midnight. It was measured at 948 hPa (or 948 mb) at the Brest-Guipavas weather station, the lowest reading in its records dating back to 1945. Weather stations on the coast at pointe du Raz, pointe Saint-Mathieu and Penmarch gave no readings, as they were damaged by the high winds. The wind speed measured at Brest was . The centre of the storm crossed Brittany from Penmarch to Saint-Brieuc at , with gusts of wind up to at Quimper, at Ushant and at la pointe de Penmarch and Granville. Waves were measured at off Ushant and Belle √éle. Similar strength storms in France since 1960: *Temp√™te Vivian in 1990 (generally milder) *Cyclones Lothar and Martin in December 1999, which claimed 140 lives, equally severe in Germany, more southern neighbouring countries also saw multiple deaths. *Cyclone Klaus which struck worse southern France and northern Spain in 2009 and claimed 26 lives. The church at Concarneau was damaged but never rebuilt, and was finally demolished a few years later. Honor Oak Park, 16 October 1987. The MS Herald of Free Enterprise was caught in the storm off Cape Finisterre as it was making its way for scrapping in Taiwan. The ship was cast adrift after its tow rope parted, finally resuming its journey on 19 October 1987. Aftermath The storm cost the insurance industry ¬£2 billion, making it the second most expensive UK weather event on record to insurers after the Burns' Day Storm of 1990. Peak wind velocities were in the early hours of the morning, which may have helped reduce the death toll. The storm hit the Isle of Wight at 02:00. Shanklin Pier on the south- east coast of the island was broken into three pieces as a result of mountainous waves. Plans to rebuild the pier were soon abandoned, and the rest of the pier was demolished by contractors shortly afterwards. A monument now stands in front of what used to be the pier entrance. A great deal of effort and money was put into the post-storm clean-up of forests and wooded areas. The writer Oliver Rackham and the charity Common Ground were active in trying to prevent unnecessary destruction of trees which, although fallen, were still living.Oliver Rackham, Trees & Woodland in the British Landscape p. 202‚Äì3 (Dent, 1990) Some landowners, such as the National Trust, did not attempt complete clearing and replanting, realising that there was a unique opportunity to study the patterns of natural regeneration after such an event.see e.g. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/3310333/1987-Great-Storm- Terrible-blow-not-a-knockout.html A number of wild boar may have escaped from captivity during the storm, after enclosures were damaged by falling trees. These boar have since bred and established populations in woods across southern England. A more positive aspect could be found among some British gardeners; as Heather Angel wrote in the Royal Horticultural Society's Journal: > In some places this natural disaster has resulted in splendid vistas- views > long since forgotten by some and never before seen by a whole new > generation. Because of gaps left by fallen trees, visitors to Arundel > Castle, the ancestral home of the Dukes of Norfolk, can now look out over > the picturesque town... At the renowned woodland rhododendron garden at > Leonardslee, Sussex, the gale... opened magnificent views by removing about > a thousand trees which owner Robin Loder said he would never have had the > courage to thin out himself.Angel, in The Garden: Journal of the Royal > Horticulyural Society, March‚ÄìApril 1988. =Criticism of the Met Office= The Met Office was severely criticised by most of the national press for failing to forecast the storm correctly. The Met Office conducted an internal inquiry, scrutinised by two independent assessors, and a number of recommendations were made. Chiefly, observational coverage of the atmosphere over the ocean to the south and west of the UK was improved by increasing the quality and quantity of observations from ships, aircraft, buoys and satellites. Continued refinements were made to the computer models used in forecasting, and changes were made in the training of forecasters. In addition, reforms in the way the Met Office reports warnings of severe weather were implemented, leading to substantially more warnings being issued in the future. Further deployment of improved tracking devices and improvements in the computer model simulations were supported by the purchase of an additional Cray supercomputer. Warnings for the Burns' Day Storm just over two years later were accurate and on time, although the model forecast hinged on observations from two ships in the Atlantic near the developing storm the day before it reached the UK. Michael Fish's 15 October 1987 forecast on the BBC BBC meteorologist Michael Fish drew particular criticism for reporting several hours before the storm hit: > Earlier on today, apparently, a woman rang the BBC and said she heard there > was a hurricane on the way; well, if you're watching, don't worry, there > isn't, but having said that, actually, the weather will become very windy, > but most of the strong winds, incidentally, will be down over Spain and > across into France. Fish has subsequently claimed that his comments about a hurricane had nothing to do with the UK; they referred to Florida, USA, and were linked to a news story immediately preceding the weather bulletin, but had been so widely repeated out of context that the British public remains convinced that he was referring to the approaching storm. According to Fish, the woman in question was actually a colleague's mother who was about to go on holiday in the Caribbean, and had called regarding Hurricane Floyd to see if it would be safe to travel. Fish has also claimed that \\"nobody phoned up\\" and that she was a \\"non-existing woman\\", apparently contradicting the previous declaration, when interviewed about Anita Hart's claims of being the woman who made the call. Fish went on to warn viewers that it would be \\"very windy\\" across the south of England, but predicted that the storm would move further south along the English Channel and the British mainland would escape the worst effects. The remainder of his warning is frequently left out of re-runs, which only adds to the public's misconception of that day's forecasting. His analysis has been defended by weather experts. In particular, the lack of a weather ship in the Southwest Approaches, due to Met Office cutbacks, meant the only manner of tracking the storm was by using satellite data, as automatic buoys had not been deployed at the time. Ironically, earlier forecasts as far back as the preceding weekend had correctly identified that gale-force winds would affect Southern England. However, later runs of the model had indicated a more southerly track for the low pressure system, incorrectly indicating that the strongest winds would be confined to Northern and Central France. The French meteorological office used a different computer weather model to the British, and the French model proved more accurate in predicting the severity of the storm in the Channel. The French meteorological service did correctly predict and warn for the storm and its intensity, but it might have been otherwise. Indeed, the ECMWF model forecast from 14 October 12 UTC failed to predict the strong winds and the storm position (although previous runs were closer to reality), and this could have led to inadequate warnings. This unusual inconsistency of ECMWF could have been a data assimilation issue, or came from poor data. In contrast, the large scale model EMERAUDE made better predictions, while still underestimating the winds. It is recognized that without the experience of the forecasters, the exceptional aspects of the storm would have been missed. In the wake of the storm, the Met Office set up the National Severe Weather Warning Service. It has been saidYoutube video \\"Britain's Biggest Storm\\" that as 15‚Äì16 October 1987 approached, shipping weather forecasts warned of storm movements in the North Atlantic, with the result that ships stayed away from North Atlantic storm tracks, depriving North Atlantic meteorology of a major necessary source of weather report data. =New understandings= Following the storm meteorologists at the University of Reading led by Professor Keith Browning developed the Sting jet concept. During reanalysis of the storm they identified a mesoscale flow where the most damaging winds were shown to be emanating from the evaporating tip of the hooked cloud head on the southern flank of the cyclone. This cloud, hooked like a scorpion's tail, gives the wind region its name the \\"Sting Jet\\". =Climatological context= It is claimed this storm was the worst since the Great Storm of 1703, which has been challenged as a myth. Storms of this strength regularly form over the North Atlantic, where they typically track to the north of Scotland. Storms of such a strength have a return period of 30 to 40 years. The unusual aspect of the storm was that it struck the densely populated southeast of England. That winds in the South East had return periods of 1 in 200 years does not mean the winds of this strength occur once every 200 years, but that the winds have a 0.5% probability of happening in a given year. Following this storm 1.3 million incidents of damage were reported, which is only exceeded by the Gale of January 1976 where destruction covered a wider area of the UK, with 1.5 million incidents of damage reported. The Burns' Day storm hit the United Kingdom in January 1990, less than three years later and with comparable intensity. Wider impacts =Black Monday= Following the storm few dealers made it to their desks and stock market trading was suspended twice and the market closed early at 12.30pm. The disruption meant the City was unable to respond to the late dealings at the beginning of the Wall Street fall-out on Friday 16 October, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded its biggest-ever one-day slide at the time, a fall of 108.36. City traders and investors spent the weekend, 17‚Äì18 October, repairing damaged gardens in between trying to guess market reaction and assessing the damage. 19 October, Black Monday, was memorable as being the first business day of the London markets after the Great Storm. =Cultural references= * The storm features in an important scene near the end of Possession: A Romance, the Man Booker Prize-winning novel by A.

More precisely Fle3 is server software for computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL). Fle3 is designed to support learner and group centered work that concentrates on creating and developing expressions of knowledge (i.e. knowledge artefacts). Fle3 supports study groups to implement knowledge building, creative problem solving and scientific method in an inquiry learning process, for example the progressive inquiry method. Fle3 user interface is translated to more than 20 languages including most of the European languages and Chinese. Fle3 is used in more than 70 countries. Fle3 is a Zope product, written in Python. Fle3 is open-source and free software released under the GNU General Public Licence (GPL). Origin of the name The abbreviation FLE comes from the words Future Learning Environment. The number 3 in the name refers to the number of times the software has been built from scratch. Components Fle3 provides various tab-accessed screens affording functionality considered important for progressive inquiry. Fle3 WebTops the interface that scaffolds students' storing, organizing and sharing their own knowledge resources including documents, files, links and notes. Fle3 Knowledge Building the interface that scaffolds students' knowledge building (and associated) discourse. Knowledge Building tool provides Knowledge Types to scaffold and structure the process. Fle3 Jamming tool is the interface that scaffolds members of a group to collaboratively construct and improve digital artifacts such as pictures, text, audio and videos. Key features of this include the ability of a user to upload the artifact, assign sharing permission and finally the graphical representation of the versioning history of the artifact. There are also interfaces that scaffold teachers and administrators to manage users and analyze student/project activity. Knowledge type sets An important feature of the Knowledge Building tool is the knowledge type sets that are scaffolding and structuring the discussions. For instance, for a progressive inquiry learning teachers may use knowledge type set designed for this purpose. Progressive Inquiry knowledge type set contains the following five knowledge types: Problem, My Explanation, Scientific Explanation, Evaluation of the Process and Summary. Every time a pupil is posting something to the discussion, she must choose what knowledge type her note represents. The knowledge types guides pupils to think adequate and important things related to the process, and this way helps them to write more substantial notes to the discussion forum. As an aid for users to follow the knowledge building discourse, users may take different views to the knowledge building discussion by sorting the notes as a discussion thread, by writer, by knowledge type, or by date. The Knowledge Building tool contains two default knowledge type sets: (1) Progressive Inquiry, and (2) Design Thinking. Depending on the selected knowledge types set, users get guidelines and a checklist on how to write their notes to the discussion forum. Each knowledge type is also color-coded making them fast to recognize and learn. History Development of Fle3 software was started in 1998 in a Future Learning Environment research and development project in Media Lab, Helsinki, Finland. Fle3 software is based on the Future Learning Environment concept promoting learning process, which differs from traditional teacher and didactic-based teaching by emphasising students active role in a learning process. The objective was to study alternative approaches of using information and communication technologies (ICT) in teaching and learning, and to design alternative learning practices and tools. At that time, the strong e-learning movement was seen to promote rather na√Øve conception of human learning. The acquisition metaphor of learning, which emphasizes learning as a process where students are supplied with pieces of knowledge, was getting stronger. The researchers of the FLE project brought to the discussion more advanced conceptions of learning, such as participation metaphor and knowledge creation metaphor . However, the objective of the FLE project was not only to bring new theoretical approaches to the discussion, but also to design learning practices and technology based on the theories. The results of this work culminated in the progressive inquiry learning model and in the Fle3 software. The history of virtual learning environments shows how the e-learning and Learning Management Systems (LMS), with course-centred outlook and focus on delivery of learning content, was, and is probably still, the mainstream approach to use of ICT in education. Although in mid-2000 the growing popularity of blogs and wikis and the consideration how they could be used in teaching and learning has led the mainstream research and development community of virtual learning to re-consider the existing e-learning paradigms. =Fle-Tools (1998‚Äì1999)= In the late 1990s the research, development and design team members of the first FLE project were greatly influenced by the work of Carl Bereiter and Marlene Scardamalia, and their concept of Knowledge building. In the design of FLE software, Bereiter's and Scardamalia's Computer-Supported Intentional Learning Environment (CSILE) was used as a reference. However, there are also many differences between the two software. For instance, already in the early design specifications of FLE there was the idea of shared artefacts that are collaboratively constructed alongside the knowledge building activities. In FLE vocabulary the activity, and the tool supporting it, is called ‚Äújamming‚Äù. Also the idea of archiving the results of the study work and to make them then available for other study groups makes FLE very different from the CSILE, which was primary designed to be a system used in a classroom. Another difference is related to the Web. From the very beginning FLE has been web-based system, and has taken in use all the advantages the flexible platform is offering, whereas the original CSILE was a client-server system. The first prototype server with FLE software was set up in 1998 and announced in early 1999. The software was named to be Fle-Tools. The software was designed in Media Lab in Helsinki but programmed by a Finnish company called NSD Consulting Oy. Fle-Tools was developed in a Future Learning Environment project funded by Tekes - the National Technology Agency of Finland. The project partners were Media Lab of the University of Art and Design Helsinki (coordinator), Centre for Research on Networked Learning and Knowledge Building in the Department of Psychology of the University of Helsinki, Finnish Ministry of Education, Finnish new media company Grey Interactive, Finnish teleoperator Sonera, and Finnish educational publisher SanomaWSOY. Fle-Tools was described to be: (1) www-based service for computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL); (2) on-line learning community and teamwork environment; (3) collection of server-based applications and databases and (4) cross-platform for end users (www-browser in Linux, Mac, Win PC, WebTV, Nokia Communicator, etc.). The tools of Fle3-Tools were: * WebTop: Personal open desk top in the web to store and share digital materials; * Knowledge Building: Asynchronous conferencing system with 'Categories of Inquiry' and different searching capabilities (by date, person, category of inquiry, users own notes, answers to own notes); * Jam Session: Asynchronous multi-user environment for collaborative design, writing, software development, etc.; * Library: Adaptive medium to publish and browse multimedia course materials * Administration: Tools for administer users, groups, courses and course materials. In 1999 Fle-Tools was tested in several university course at the University of Helsinki and the University of Art and Design Helsinki. The results form the pilots were published in scientific conferences and journals. In the end of 1999, The Finnish operator Sonera, who was a key partner in the Future Learning Environment project, decided to draw back from the project and started to develop their own product based on Fle-Tools. This resulted as a breakdown of the original Future Learning Environment research and development project. =Fle2 (1999‚Äì2001)= Fle2 (2001) Knowledge Building - Add note view. The next generation FLE software was developed during the years 1999‚Äì2001. Because of the collapse of the original Future Learning Environment project consortium in 1999 the research and design partners felt that they must continue the FLE development on their own. In 2000 the Fle2 project got funding from the Nordic Council of Ministers NordUnet 2 program. The partners of the project were Media Lab in Helsinki, Department of Communication, Journalism and Computer Science of Roskilde University in Denmark, and Department of Psychology of the University of Helsinki. The new software was named Fle2 and released online for free downloading in April 2001. Fle2 was based on the design of Fle-Tools, but this time the software development and programming was carried-out in Media Lab Helsinki. The Fle2 was built on top of the BSCW - Basic Support for Cooperative Work software developed by the Fraunhofer Society in Germany. The tools of Fle2 were personal WebTops and Knowledge Building. Th Fle2 did not have Jam Session or Library tools of the earlier Fle-Tools. In the Fle2 WebTop there were two new features compared to the earlier Fle-Tools: (1) \\"yellow notes\\" made it possible to add notes to other people WebTops when visiting them, and (2) chat with whiteboard for chating and drawing with other users online. In 2002 the design and development team in Helsinki realized that BSCW was not the right platform for developing the FLE software. The main reason for giving up the development of Fle2 on top of the BSCW was the fact that BSCW was not an Open Source / Free Software. =Fle3 (2002‚Äì2006)= Fle3 (2001) Jamming tool. Fle3 is the third and the latest version of FLE software. The first version of Fle3 was released on February 15, 2002. The latest version 1.5 was released in April 2005. Fle3 was largely developed in the Innovative Technology for Collaborative Learning and Knowledge Building (ITCOLE) project, funded by the European Commission in the Information Society Technologies (IST) framework's 'School of Tomorrow' program. The ITCOLE project was coordinated by the Media Lab in Helsinki. The technical development partners included the developers of BSCW ‚Äì Basic Support for Cooperative Work in Fraunhofer Society and Department of Computer Science of the University of Murcia in Spain. Testing of different software in schools was coordinated by Helsinki City Education Department and pedagogical research was carried out by researcher from University of Helsinki, University of Amsterdam, University of Salerno, University of Rome La Sapienza, University of Athens and University of Utrecht. In the ITCOLE project there were several parallel software development projects. At first Fle3 was developed in Media Lab in Helsinki as a user interface and interaction demonstration for the main software development taking place in Fraunhofer and based on their BSCW system. The University of Murcia's main task was to develop the synchronous communications tools, which were then integrated experimentally to BSCW and Fle3. The software based on BSCW was named at first Synergeia and later BSCL (Basic Support for Collaborative Learning). During the course of the project Fle3 was found user friendly, accessible, and technically reliable for a wider use. This way it ended up to be not only a UI and interaction prototype but also software of its own. Finally Fle3 became one of the main results of the ITCOLE project. There has been no noticeable development in the Fle3 project since 2006. =Fle4 (2009‚Äì2015)= The core component of FLE3, the scaffolded knowledge-building discussion board, was re-created as a simple plugin in WordPress, the ubiquitous open source web server system. FLE4 was not intended to be a new system, but instead a re-implementation of the most important element of the previous system in a very user-friendly technology. Two sets of scaffolds are available in FLE4: Knowledge Building with its 5 knowledge types and de Bono's Six Hat Thinking with its 6 knowledge types. In 2013, a map view was added, providing an automatically generated 2D view of the discussion in which users can both view and post. While FLE4 is not under active development (2015), occasional updates and bug fixes are released.

In addition to his work with The Killers, Flowers has released two solo albums, Flamingo (2010) and The Desired Effect (2015). He has reached number one on the UK Albums Chart eight times, and on the Billboard 200 once, including work by The Killers.  Early life  Brandon Richard Flowers, the youngest of six children, was born on June 21, 1981, in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, Nevada, to Jean Yvonne (n√©e Barlow; 1945‚Äì2010)http://obits.reviewjournal.com/obituaries/lvrj/obituary.aspx?n=jean- flowers&pid;=139671234 and Terry Austin Flowers. He has an older brother and four older sisters. His family lived in Henderson until Flowers was eight, when they moved to Payson, Utah, for two years before moving to Nephi, Utah, at which time he was in the sixth grade. Flowers lived in Nephi until his junior year at Juab High School. He moved to Las Vegas to live with his aunt and graduated from Chaparral High School in 1999. Flowers said that growing up in Las Vegas as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) helped prepare him for the world of rock and roll: \\"Really, being a [member] in Las Vegas prepared me for the lion's den.

After several short-lived bassists and drummers, Flowers and Keuning were joined by bassist Mark Stoermer and drummer Ronnie Vannucci, and the line-up became official in August 2002. Between 2003 and 2017, they released five consecutive chart- topping studio albums and have sold over 22 million records worldwide.No other international act ever has managed an untarnished career streak of five Number 1 studio albums from their debut The Killers are among those artists who have spent more than 1,000 weeks on the UK music charts during their career. Flowers wrote the lyrics to the single \\"All These Things That I've Done\\" and its popular refrain \\"I Got Soul, But I'm Not A Soldier\\" that numbered among the \\"100 Greatest Songs of All Time\\" by The Daily Telegraph and earned one of the band's seven Grammy nominations. He is also the author of the lyrics of single \\"Mr. Brightside,\\" which holds the record for most weeks spent on the UK Singles Chart (242 weeks and counting). Their second album Sam's Town, paid homage to Flowers' hometown and family, and earned the band their first BRIT Awards (Best International Album and Group), and included the chart-topping single \\"When You Were Young\\". Before releasing their first Billboard 200 No.1 album Wonderful Wonderful (2017) and chart topping single \\"The Man,\\" the band took a one-year hiatus during which Flowers released his second and most favorably reviewed solo album to that date. On July 4, 2010, the Killers headlined the \\"Salute to the Military\\" USO Concert at the White House. They performed \\"God Bless America\\" and favorites from their catalogue. On June 22, 2013, the Killers headlined the 90,000-capacity Wembley Stadium, their biggest solo show to date. = Solo career (2010-present) =  Flamingo (2010‚Äì11)  Flowers on Flamingo Road Tour in 2010 Flowers debuted his solo act at the Shimmer Showroom in Las Vegas on August 15, 2010.

The singles later formed the charity compilation album Don't Waste Your Wishes (2016). Sir Elton John listed Flowers as one of his top five heroes while editing The Independent's World Aids Day special edition. The Killers have also contributed songs for cover albums with proceeds going to charities supporting natural disaster relief (Rhythms del Mundo Classics) and famine- stricken areas (AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered). The Killers co-organized a benefit concert in December 2017 for those affected by the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, raising more than $700,000.https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/shootings/benefit-concert-for- las-vegas-shooting-victims-raises-over-700k/  Artistry  = Influences = Flowers has listed the Cars and Depeche Mode as musical influences.https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/brandon-flowers-talks-rock- hall-tom-petty-tribute-cars-w519144 =Musical style and vocals= Flowers is regarded as a prominent frontman of the new wave revival in the 2000s.

Awards in several categories are distributed annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \\"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position.\\" The honor was first presented in 1968 at the 10th Grammy Awards as Best Contemporary Album to The Beatles for Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The category was then discontinued until 1995 where it emerged with the new name Best Pop Album. In 2001, the category became known as Best Pop Vocal Album. According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award is presented to artists that perform \\"albums containing at least 51% playing time of newly recorded pop vocal tracks.\\" The award goes to the artist, producer and engineer/mixer, provided they worked on more than 50% of playing time on the album. A producer or engineer/mixer who worked on less than 50% of playing time, as well as the mastering engineer, do not win an award, but can apply for a Winners Certificate. Kelly Clarkson and Adele are the only two-time winners of this award, and Clarkson was the first to win twice. Clarkson and Justin Timberlake have both been nominated five times, more than any other artist, though Clarkson is the only artist to have the most solo albums nominated. Three of Timberlake's are solo, two are from NSYNC.

Architect William Pereira designed the main structure. It was also known as Hanna- Barbera's Marineland during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Marineland operated from 1954 until 1987, when it was purchased by the owners of SeaWorld San Diego. The new owners moved the popular killer whales and other animals to their San Diego facility and abruptly closed Marineland. Dolphin Show, August, 1962 History =Marineland= When it opened in 1954, one year before Disneyland, Marineland of the Pacific was the world's largest oceanarium. The park was designed by William Pereira whose work, which included the Transamerica Pyramid, the Los Angeles International Airport, and the Geisel Library helped define the architectural look of mid-20th century California. Marineland was best known for its performing orcas or \\"killer whales\\". It was also noteworthy for its Baja Reef concept, a first-of-its-kind swim-through aquarium featuring a wide array of sea life. Visitors could enter the winding aquarium wearing a swim mask and snorkel and swim with the fish and sharks. Marineland also contained educational and research facilities in addition to its unique entertainment structures. Marineland was home to Orky and Corky, two of the most famous orcas on exhibit at any oceanarium at the time. They should not be confused with the original \\"Orky\\" and \\"Corky\\", which did not live long in captivity and had no calves. Marineland was also home to the first pilot whales (\\"Bubbles\\" and \\"Bimbo\\") ever captured for display, as well as dolphins, sea lions, harbor seals, sharks, and a variety of other related sea creatures. =Closing= Pilot Whale & Dolphin Show, August, 1962 Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (the owner of the SeaWorld ocean park family) purchased the facility in December 1986 from a Hong Kong developer. At the time the park was run down and was just breaking even. Restoration plans were canceled on January 30, 1987 as Harcourt claimed that the park was in more disrepair than expected. Yearly losses of $2 million were projected unless improvements costing $25 million were undertaken. Orky and Corky were moved to SeaWorld's San Diego park a few weeks after the purchase supposedly for mating, where Corky was given the new name of \\"Shamu\\". Rancho Palos Verdes city council passed a ordinance requiring them to maintain the park and allow access to its beach. Although the company had promised to keep Marineland open, it was suddenly closed on February 11, 1987, six weeks after the sale was completed. As, the company was getting bomb threats. The animals were trucked out in the middle of the night, and the new owners poured concrete into the drains so the park could not be reopened. Many local residents complained about the sudden closure. On March 1, 1987, the company announced that the park would stay closed. =Abandonment= Bubbles the Pilot Whale, performing, August, 1962 Much of the infrastructure was left abandoned for nearly 20 years. Marineland's most visible landmark, the high tower, remained standing until 1995. The Marineland Restaurant continued operating through 2004 as the \\"Catalina Room\\" (where Santa Catalina Island was visible on a clear day). Several other structures remained through 2006. =Redevelopment= In 1995, developer York Long Point purchased of coastal land that included the Marineland location for $24 million. After several false starts, development began in 2007 on a new $450 million resort, a project by Lowe Destination Development, which was planned to include a hotel, privately owned \\"casitas\\", and full spa and resort facilities. Originally projected to include an 18-hole golf course, the plan was changed to include only an \\"Executive Par 3\\" golf course on the resort property. In early 2006, two small temporary sales offices replaced the abandoned gas station at the park entrance, and the large concrete sign along Palos Verdes Drive South (with a tower resembling a whale's tail) was altered to feature the logo and artist's impression of the resort. In July 2007, principal construction commenced, starting with the demolition of the remains of Marineland. The resort was completed in 2009. The Point Vicente Interpretive Center, located a half-mile north on the same road, reopened in July 2006 after extensive remodeling, and it has a number of items related to Marineland in an exhibit, including a \\"Save Marineland\\" pin and various publications from the park. One of the original dolphin statues that formerly adorned the entrance to Marineland is also on display. Historical Society The Marineland of the Pacific Historical Society was formed in 2003 \\"to provide information and access to historical information and images of the park to students, researchers, industry professionals, and interested parties\\". Television, film and music While still in operation, the park was prominently featured in several television shows, including two episodes of The Beverly Hillbillies, The Munsters, The Partridge Family, Hart to Hart, The Six Million Dollar Man, Emergency!, The Colbys, Wonder Woman, Sea Hunt, and later, Simon & Simon and an A Team episode a year before the park closed.IMDb - \\"The A-Team\\" Beneath the Surface (TV episode 1986) Two episodes of The Chevy Show were taped there with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans featuring an \\"Aquarodeo\\" on May 1, 1960 and January 15, 1961. In an episode of the Lucy Show, Lucille Ball falls into a Marineland animal exhibit which was featured on the August 28, 1965 cover of TV Guide. In 1958, Dixieland jazz artist Red Nichols recorded a live album at Marineland. In an episode of Wonderbug, titled Fish Story, Marineland was integral to the plot. Marineland was also briefly featured in the Charles Bronson film, The Mechanic, the Elvis Presley film, Live a Little, Love a Little, and the John Carradine film \\"Blood of Dracula's Castle\\". The \\"Poor Little Kangaroo Rat\\" episode of \\"Route 66\\" starring Martin Milner and George Maharis was filmed there with guest stars Ronny Howard, Leslie Nielsen, Maggie Pierce, and Joanne Linville which was in season 3 and episode 10 and originally aired on 11-23-62. Since its closing, scenes for several feature films have been shot at the location, including Mermaids of Tiburon, the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films, Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget, Fun with Dick and Jane, Pearl Harbor, The Aviator, Hidalgo, and Life As A House. For the latter, the suburban neighborhood exterior was entirely constructed from scratch on the site, as it was for Fun with Dick and Jane. Mel Gibson's trailer was parked at the bottom of the cliff for Lethal Weapon 2. Beastmaster 2 was filmed there as well. Several TV shows have also used the site for their filming needs, including regular use by NBC's Fear Factor and one episode of Viper. The location was also used for MTV's Motel California.

He was the Prime Minister of France from 29 December 1818 to 18 November 1819. Early life Born in Auch, in 1767, he was educated under the direction of his uncle, Ir√©n√©e-Yves de Solle, who was the Bishop of Digne and later Chamb√©ry. Military career =French Revolutionary Wars= Having entered into military service in 1792, he became an Adjutant-General under the command of Napol√©on Bonaparte during the Italian campaign of the War of the First Coalition. He soon rose to the rank of Brigadier-General on 31 May 1797. During the War of the Second Coalition, he served as Chief of Staff to Jean Moreau in the Italian theatre, where he distinguished himself at Noir in 1799. He defeated the Austrians in the Valtellina in 1800, where under his command, French forces killed 1,200, captured 4,000 men, and eighteen pieces of cannon. He assisted at the Battle of Novi, at the Battles of Sainte-Marie (where he was named Major-General on 13 April 1799, and also at Lodi, where he was honoured with the nickname 'Decius fran√ßais' (French Decius). He contributed to the French victory of Hohenlinden in 1801, and remained in service up to the Peace of Lun√©ville. =Napoleonic Wars= He was named a State Councillor (Conseiller d'√âtat) in ordinary service, attached to the War section, on 30 Frimaire of the year X. In the Year XII, he entered into extraordinary service, and remained a member of the Council of Administration of War (Conseil d'Administration de la Guerre) until 1805. On 12 Pluvi√¥se of the year XIII, he was named Governor of the Palace of Versailles, and Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour in 1805. He received the provisional command of the Army of Hanover, until he was replaced by Bernadotte. He was then on standby until 1808. He was disgraced in 1806 for having held hostile intentions against the Emperor, and was taken off the Council List (Liste du Conseil) on 2 February 1806. Napol√©on wrote to Fouch√© on the subject: > \\"Je vous dirais que le g√©n√©ral Desolles a tenu en confidence des propos fort > extraordinaires qui montreraient l'existence d'une petite clique aussi > envenim√©e que l√¢che.\\" (I would like to say to you that the general Desolles > has taken into confidence very extraordinary intentions which would show the > existence of a little clique as poisoned as it is cowardly.) - > Correspondence, XI, n¬∞ 9088 He thereafter retired to a property that he owned near Auch, the Chartreuse du Pastisse at Preignan. Eventually winning back imperial favour, he did not return to the State Council (Conseil d'√âtat), and from 1808 to 1810 he commanded a division in Spain (during the Peninsular War). He distinguished himself at the Battle of Oca√±a, at the Passage of Sierra Morena, and at Despena-Perros. He also captured Cordoba, where he governed in a manner \\"to reconcile hearts\\". He returned to France in February 1811, and remained until March 1812, when he was named Chief of Staff to Eug√®ne de Beauharnais. In 1812, upon arrival in Smolensk, his health obligated him to return to Paris. Political career under the Bourbons On the first restoration of Louis XVIII, in 1814, the provisional government named him Commander-in-Chief of the National Guard and all troops of the 1st Division; the Comte d'Artois named him a member of the Provisional State Council (Conseil d'√âtat provisoire); and the King named him Minister of State, a Peer of France, Major-General of all the National Guards of the Kingdom, Commander of Saint-Louis, and Grand Cordon of the Legion of Honour. These favours were rewards for his efforts convincing Emperor Alexander I of Russia to reject the proposed Habsburg-Bonaparte regency of Empress Marie-Louise, and instead supporting the restoration of the French Bourbons. He was opposed to the return of Napol√©on during the Hundred Days, and pronounced himself in favour of the Bourbons in 1814. Under the Second Restoration, he pursued a political career. He was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and President of the Council (Prime Minister) with the formation of a liberal ministry in December 1818. In November 1819, he retired, disgusted by the demands of the reactionaries. He received public recognition as 'Ministre Honn√™te Homme' (Gentleman Minister), and was thereafter a supporter of civil liberties. He died in November 1828, at the Chateau de Monthuchet at Saulx-les-Chartreux (Essonne). He was buried at the P√®re-Lachaise Cemetery (28th division).  Family  H√©l√®ne Charlotte Pauline Dessolles (Antoine-Jean Gros) From his marriage with Anne √âmilie (1777-1852), daughter of General Auguste Marie Henri Picot de Dampierre, he had one daughter, H√©l√®ne-Charlotte-Pauline (17 July 1805 ‚Äì 10 July 1864), who married Alexander Jules de La Rochefoucauld (1796-1856), Duc d'Etissac.

Clactonian tools were made by Homo heidelbergensis. It is named after 400,000-year-old finds made by Hazzledine Warren in a palaeochannel at Clacton-on-Sea in the English county of Essex in 1911. The artifacts found there included flint chopping tools, flint flakes and the tip of a worked wooden shaft along with the remains of a giant elephant and hippopotamus. Further examples of the tools have been found at sites including Barnfield Pit and Rickson's Pit, near Swanscombe in Kent and Barnham in Suffolk; similar industries have been identified across Northern Europe. The Clactonian industry involved striking thick, irregular flakes from a core of flint, which was then employed as a chopper. The flakes would have been used as crude knives or scrapers. Unlike the Oldowan tools from which Clactonian ones derived, some were notched implying that they were attached to a handle or shaft. Retouch is uncommon and the prominent bulb of percussion on the flakes indicates use of a hammerstone. An \\"Egyptian verson\\" of the Clactonian industry was proposed in 1972, based on excavations on the banks of the Nile River, at the 100 foot terrace. The Clactonian controversy The Clactonian industry may have co-existed with the Acheulean industry, which used identical basic techniques but which also had handaxe technology; tools made by bifacially working a flint core. The justification for considering \\"Clactonian\\" as a tradition distinct from Acheulean has been called into question in a 1994 article. The Clactonian industry may in fact be the same thing as the Acheulean and only assessed as being different due to its tools being Acheulean ones made by individuals who had no need for handaxes on the occasion that they made them. Differences in environment and the availability and quality of local raw materials may account for the differences between the two industries, which, at one point it was inferred, were only perceived by modern archaeologists. However, the 2004 excavation of a butchered Pleistocene elephant at the Southfleet Road site of High Speed 1 in Kent recovered numerous Clactonian flint tools but no handaxes. As a handaxe would have been more useful than a chopper in dismembering an elephant carcass it is considered strong evidence of the Clactonian being a separate industry. Flint of sufficient quality was available in the area and it is likely that the people who carved up the elephant did not possess the knowledge to make the more advanced bifacial handaxe. Proponents of the Clactonian as an independent industry point to the lack of concrete evidence in favour of it being an anomalous Acheulean industry. The precise provenance of the few attributed bifacial Clactonian tools (which point to Acheulean influence) is in dispute. The traditional chronology of Clactonian being followed by Acheulean is also being increasingly challenged since finds of Acheulean tools were made at Boxgrove in Sussex and High Lodge in Suffolk. These finds came from deposits connected with the Anglian Stage, the glaciation that preceded the Hoxnian Stage and therefore would have preceded the Clactonian. Whether or not they are separate industries it would seem that the 'Clactonian' and 'Acheulean' stone tool makers would have had cultural contact with each other.

Released in 1969, it is recognized as a landmark in soul music. Recorded with The Bar-Kays, the album features four lengthy tracks, including the Burt Bacharach/Hal David cover \\"Walk On By\\" and an almost 19-minute long version of Jimmy Webb's \\"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\\", both songs were edited significantly and released as a double A-side single in July 1969. Background Hayes' 1968 solo debut, Presenting Isaac Hayes, had been a poor seller for the record label Stax Records, and Hayes was about to return to his behind-the-scenes role as a producer and songwriter, when the label suddenly lost its entire back catalog after splitting with Atlantic Records in May 1968. Stax executive Al Bell decided to release an almost-instant back catalog of 27 albums and 30 singles at once, and ordered all of Stax's artists to record new material, encouraging some of Stax's prominent creative staff, including Hayes and guitarist Steve Cropper, to record solo albums. After feeling burned by the retail and creative flop of his first album, Hayes told Bell that he would not record a follow-up or any other album unless he was granted complete creative control. Since Bell had encouraged Hayes to record Presenting... in the first place, he readily agreed. Production Produced by Al Bell with Allen Jones and Marvell Thomas, the record was tracked by engineer Terry Manning at the Ardent Studios location on National Street in Memphis. The Bar-Kays were the tracking band, supplemented by pianist and co- producer Marvell Thomas (son of Rufus Thomas). Isaac Hayes played Hammond organ and sang the vocals live while conducting the tracking band at the same time. Much of the later production was done as part of the package of products brought to Detroit by producer Don Davis to expedite the production process. The strings and horns were arranged by Detroit arranger, Johnny Allen. The producers were looking for a sweeping orchestral sound that would enhance the rock solid rhythm tracks. The project strings and horns were recorded at United Sound Studios by engineer Ed Wolfrum with vocals and final mix at Tera Shirma by engineer Russ Terrana. The pre-delay reverberation technique, recorded in part by Terry Manning on the tracking session, had been used at Artie Fields productions in Detroit in late 1950s, and at Columbia Records; it was also used by Wolfrum and others for numerous productions and commercials previous and after the release of this project including the Marvin Gaye What's Going On project, with orchestration also recorded at United. Russ Terrana went on to the engineering staff of Motown Records and was responsible for the recording and mixing of many hits on that label. Reception American punk musician Henry Rollins has frequently referred to Hot Buttered Soul as being one of his all-time favorite albums; Rollins interviewed Hayes for his book Do I Come Here Often? The album was released in June 1969 and peaked at number 1 on the top R&B; chart, and at number 8 on the Billboard 200.

They are used in pairs. The lower, stationary, stone is called a quern, while the upper mobile stone is called a muller or handstone. The central hole is called the hopper and a handle slot enables the handstone to be rotated. They were first used in the Neolithic era to grind cereals into flour. Uses of quern-stones An old Gaelic proverb is \\"The quern performs best when the grindstone has been pitted.\\" =Design of quern- stones= The upper stones were usually concave whilst the lower was convex. Quern-stones are frequently identifiable by their grooved working surfaces which enabled the movement of flour. Sometimes a millrind was present as a piece of wood (or other material), which allowed the cereal etc to be added but still acted as a centering device. The upper stone sometimes had a cup- shaped area around the hopper hole with a raised edge. Most handstones have a handle hole on the upper surface, however one class of quern-stones have a slot handle which indicates that a piece of wood was placed horizontally and protruded out from the edge so that the operator could turn the stone by standing and using a rod vertically. One class of upper quern-stones has from two to three sockets for the rod used to turn them and this is thought to reflect the need to reduce wear and tear by having alternative points of contact when in active use. =Grain= Revolving beehive quern-stones and [lower] a saddlestone on display at Cliffe Castle Museum, in Keighley, West Yorkshire. Quern-stones have been used by numerous civilizations throughout the world to grind materials, the most important of which was usually grain to make flour for bread-making. They were generally replaced by millstones once mechanised forms of milling appeared, particularly the water mill and the windmill, although animals were also used to operate the millstones. However, in many non-Westernised, non-mechanised cultures they are still manufactured and used regularly and have only been replaced in many parts of the world in the last century or so. The use of grinding stones for vegetal food processing, and possibly the production of flour, was widespread across Europe from at least 30,000 years ago.Anna Revedin et al., Thirty thousand-year-old evidence of plant food processing, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2010, vol. 107, no. 44, pp. 18815‚Äì18819 (18815) In early Maya civilizations the process of nixtamalization was distinctive in that hard, ripe kernels of maize (corn) were boiled in water and lime, thus producing nixtamal which was then made into unleavened dough for flat cakes by grinding with a handstone on a quern (metate). Quern stones were used in China at least 10,000 years ago to grind wheat into flour. The production of flour by rubbing wheat by hand took several hours. Due to their form, dimensions, and the nature of the treatment of the surfaces, they reproduce precisely the most ancient implements used for grinding cereal grain into flour. Saddle querns were known in China during the Neolithic Age but rotary stone mills did not appear until the Warring States Period. A prehistoric quern dating back to 23,000 BCE was found at the Longwangchan archaeological site, in Hukou, Shaanxi in 2007. The site is located in the heartland of the northern Chinese loess plateau near the Yellow River. =Other materials= As well as grain, ethnographic evidence and Mesopotamian texts show that a wide range of foodstuffs and inorganic materials were processed using stone querns or mortars, including nuts, seeds, fruit, vegetables, herbs, spices, meat, bark, pigments, temper and clay.Wright 1992:87f Moreover, one study analysing quern- stones noted that a number of querns had traces of arsenic and bismuth, unlike their source rocks, and had levels of antimony which were ten times higher than those of the rocks. The authors concluded that this was probably due to the use of these querns in the preparation of medicines, cosmetics, dyes or even in the manufacture of alloys.Lease et al. 2001:235 Querns were widely used in grinding metals ores after mining extraction. The aim was to liberate fine ore particles which could then be separated by washing for example, prior to smelting. They were thus widely used in gold mining in antiquity. In Shetland tobacco was not smoked when first introduced, but instead was ground up into snuff, and inhaled up the nose. Snuff-querns consisted of an upper and lower stone, fixed together by a central iron pivot. The quern was held on the user's lap, the eye of the quern was filled with dried tobacco leaves, and then the upper-stone was turned using the handle. The friction caused by the turning ground the leaves into a fine powder that built up around the edge of the lower-stone. Many snuff-querns had a small hole or cut made near the edge of the upper-stone, into which a pointed end of a lamb's horn was placed in order to turn the stone; an alternative to using a handle.Snuff Quern. Accessed  2009-11-20 =Incidental uses= A stack of quern-stones for sale in a market in Haikou, Hainan, China. These quern-stones are only about 30 cm wide. There are, however, more surprising recorded uses of quern-stones. For example, DeBoer, in his review of the traditional gambling games of North American tribes, reports that one of the games involved bouncing a group of split canes off a quern.DeBoer 2001:223. Violence is recorded thus in the Old Testament in the Book of Judges (9:53; NRSV): ‚ÄúBut a certain woman threw an upper-millstone on Abimelech‚Äôs head, and crushed his skull.‚Äù Manufacture of quern-stones The best type of stone from which to manufacture quern-stones are igneous rocks such as basalt. These have naturally rough surfaces, but grains do not detach easily, so the material being ground does not become gritty. However, such rocks are not always available, meaning that quern- stones have been manufactured from a wide variety of rocks, including sandstone, quartzite and limestone. Quernmore Crag near Lancaster in England is named after the quarrying of millstone grit used to make quern stones in these parts. The names of the mountains of Whernside and Great Whernside in the Yorkshire Dales have the same origin. Rutter was able to show, for the southern Levant, that basalt quern-stones were preferred to those manufactured from other rock types. Basalt quern-stones were therefore transported over long-distances, leading him to argue that, despite their everyday, utilitarian function, they were also used as a status symbol. Research in Scotland has indicated that to a degree regional styles existed. Palestine (1900) Evolution of quern-stones Knocking stones were used in the preparation of small quantities of cereal however the earliest forms of quern were the saddle and trough querns. The earliest quern so far discovered dates to c. 9,000 BCE and was found at Abu Hureyra, Syria. A later development was the rotary quern, which takes several forms. =Saddle quern= The saddle quern is produced by rocking or rolling the muller using parallel motions (i.e., pushing and pulling the handstone), which forms a shape looking like a saddle. These are the most ancient and widely used type of quern-stone and were superseded around the 5th to the 4th century BC by the more efficient rotary quern. The handstones for saddle querns are generally either roughly cylindrical (not unlike a rolling pin) and used with both hands, or rough hemispheres and used with one hand. This provides a crushing motion, not a grinding action and is more suitable for crushing malted grain. It is not easy to produce flour from a saddle quern with unmalted grain. The muller is also referred to as a 'rubber' or 'mouler'.MacSween, A & Sharp, M (1989), Prehistoric Scotland. London : B.T.Batsford. . p. 17. =Rotary hand quern= As the name implies, the rotary quern used circular motions to grind the material, meaning both the quern and the handstone were generally circular. The handstone of a rotary quern is much heavier than that of saddle quern and provides the necessary weight for the grinding of unmalted grain into flour. In some cases the grinding surfaces of the stones fit into each other, the upper stone being slightly concave and the lower one convex. Rotary Hand Quern at the Estonian Open Air Museum Beehive quern Querns from the Whithorn Museum In this type the upper stone is hemispherical, or bun-shaped, with a central conical hopper to hold the grain that falls down a hole to the grinding surface. It is held in position with a pivot that fits into a central hole in the bottom stone. The upper stone also has a deep horizontal socket in its steep side in which to place the wooden peg used as a handle to rotate or oscillate the upper stone. This was the earliest type of rotary quern to appear in the British Isles. It arrived in Britain in the middle of the Iron Age (about 400-300 BC) and spread into the northern half of Ireland, probably from Scotland, some time after the 2nd century BC.J.T. Koch, An Atlas for Celtic Studies (2007), p. 150. Disc quern A hand quern being operatedGarnett, T. Observations on a Tour through the Highlands and part of the Western Isles of Scotland, particularly Staff and Icolmkill. Pub. T. Cadell. The Strand. P. 155. The adjustable, discoid rotary quern has larger, flatter and more discoid stones than the beehive type. The lower stone was completely perforated. The long handle rotated in a shallow socket in the upper surface of the upper stone. They are thought to have originated in Spain 2,500 years ago and appear to have arrived in maritime Scotland from about 200 BC with people who built the defensive homes known as brochs. This Iron Age type closely resembles the adjustable Highland quern still in use in historic times.E.W. MacKie, The broch cultures of Atlantic Scotland: origins, high noon and decline: part 2: The Middle Iron Age: high noon and decline c.200 BC ‚Äì AD 550, Oxford Journal of Archaeology, vol. 29, no 1. (2010), pp. 89-117 (100). The quern rests on the earasaid of the woman on the right, possibly to catch grain; she feeds the stone with grain from the bowl at her left. Woodcut from Thomas Pennant's 1772 book A Tour in Scotland. Garnett in his 1800 tour of Scotland describes the use of a hand quern as follows: \\"The quern consists of two circular pieces of stone, generally grit or granite, about twenty inches in diameter. In the lower stone is a wooden peg, rounded at the top; on this the upper stone is nicely balanced, so as just to touch the lower one, by means of a piece of wood fixed in a large hole in this upper piece, but which does not fill the hole, room for feeding the mill being left on each side: it is so nicely balanced, that though there is some friction from the contact of the two stones, yet a very small momentum will make it revolve several times, when it has no corn in it. The corn being dried, two women sit down on the ground, having the quern between them; the one feeds it, while the other turns it round, relieving each other occasionally, and singing some Celtic songs all the time.\\" Miniature quern Under in diameter and varying from roughly dressed to carefully worked, often with vertical handle sockets, a new class of querns has been identified having been overlooked in the past as weights, etc. In all respects they are like full sized quern stones and they show the typical wear signs that indicate that they were used for grinding small amounts of seeds, minerals or herbs. A suggestion that they may have been made as toys is thought to be unlikely. =Other types of quern stones= Other forms of quern-stone include hopper-rubbers and Pompeian mills, both used by the Romans. The larger rotary mills were usually worked by a donkey or horse via an extension arm of wood attached to the upper stone. Sound of a Roman mill. Querns utilizing crank-and-connecting rods were used in the Western Han Dynasty. Laws against use There was a legal requirement in Scotland for tenants to pay for use of the baron's mill. Early leases of mills gave to the miller the legal right to break quern-stones which were being used in defiance of thirlage agreements.Enid Gauldie, The Scottish Miller 1700‚Äì1900(John Donald 1981), . The obligations of thirlage eventually ceased to apply, but thirlage in Scotland was only formally and totally abolished on 28 November (Martinmas) 2004 by the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000. Similar requirements existed and were enforced actively in England.Querns and millstones Ornament and inscription A number of handstones have been found with extra carving however it is not always straightforward to separate decoration from practical functional purposes. The designs invest in the appearance of the handstone when it is in circular motion and the ability of the quern-stones to change seeds into flour may invoke a feeling of transformative magic that attracted both reverence and status to these household objects. Three beehive querns found in Ireland have inscribed ornament of La T√®ne type, as do examples from England and Wales. Many of the horizontal slot-handled quern-stones have decoration that usually follows the basic pattern of motifs that encircle the hopper and/or the handle slot. One type though has an irregular pattern of cup marks that encircle the hopper. A quern was discovered at Dunadd in Scotland which has a cross carved into the upper stone. The cross has expanded terminals and ultimately derives its form from Roman and Byzantine predecessors of the fifth and sixth centuries. This example has a high quality of finishing which reflects its 'cost' and enhances its symbolic value and social significance. The cross is likely to have 'protected' the corn and the resultant flour from evil, such as fungal rust or ergot. Various legends give miraculous power to mill-stones and several have been found which have been re-used in the construction of burial cists or as tomb stones. The association between quern stones and burial may be because they are used in the process of making bread, the staple of life. A broken or disused quern therefore can be seen as symbolic of death.Ewan Campbell, A cross-marked quern from Dunadd and other evidence for relations between Dunass and Iona, Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, vol. 5, no. 117 (1987), pp. 105 - 117. In Clonmacnoise, near Athlone in County Offaly in Ireland, a quern stone was found which had been made into a tombstone, having been ornamented and the name Sechnasach, who died in 928 AD, inscribed onto it.Janet and Colin Bord, Mysterious Britain (Garnstone 1973), . P. 62. A large quern was discovered on the Lough Scur crannog in Ireland. The Wondrous Mauchline Quern In the 9th century the Welsh monk Nennius wrote a history of Britain, the Historia Brittonum, in which he lists the thirteen wonders of Britain, and included in it is the wondrous 'Mauchline Quern' that ground constantly, except on Sundays. It could be heard working underground and the local placename 'Auchenbrain' may celebrate it, translating from the Gaelic as 'field of the quern.Watson, William J. (1926).

Its ruins are the site of a razed stronghold of the Cathars. The present fortress on the site, though described as one of the \\"Cathar castles,\\" is actually of a later period. It has been listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture since 1862. Geography The ruins of Monts√©gur are perched at a precarious altitude in the south of France near the Pyrenees. Located in the heart of France's Languedoc-Occitanie regions, southwest of Carcassonne, Monts√©gur dominates a rock formation known as a pog ‚Äî a term derived from the Languedocien dialect of Occitan ‚Äî pu√≤g or pu√®g, meaning \\"peak, hill, mountain.\\" The top of the ruin is reached by a path and is 170m above the road. History The earliest signs of human settlement in the area date back to the stone age. Evidence of Roman occupation such as Roman currency and tools have also been found in and around the site. Its name comes from Latin mons securus, which evolved into mont s√©gur in Occitan, which means \\"safe hill\\". In the Middle Ages the Montsegur region was ruled by the Counts of Toulouse, the Viscounts of Carcassonne and finally the Counts of Foix. Little is known about the fortification until the time of the Albigensian Crusade. =Cathar castle= Monts√©gur In about 1204, Raymond de P√©reille, one of the two lords of Monts√©gur, the other being his cousin Pierre-Roger de Mirepoix, decided to rebuild the castle that had been in ruins for 40 years or more. Refortified, the castle became a center of Cathar activities, and home to Guilhabert de Castres, a Cathar theologian and bishop. In 1233 the site became \\"the seat and head\\" (domicilium et caput) of the Cathar church. It has been estimated that the fortified site housed about 500 people when in 1241, Raymond VII besieged Montsegur without success. The murder of representatives of the inquisition by about fifty men from Montsegur and faidits at Avignonet on May 28, 1242 was the trigger for the final military expedition to conquer the castle, the siege of Monts√©gur. In 1242 Hugues de Arcis led the military command of about 10,000 royal troops against the castle that was held by about 100 fighters and was home to 211 Perfects (who were pacifists and did not fight) and civilian refugees. The siege lasted nine months, until in March 1244, the castle finally surrendered. Approximately 220 Cathars were burned en masse in a bonfire at the foot of the pog when they refused to renounce their faith. Some 25 actually took the ultimate Cathar vow of consolamentum perfecti in the two weeks before the final surrender. Those who renounced the Cathar faith were allowed to leave and the castle itself was destroyed. Inner courtyard In the days prior to the fall of the fortress, several Cathars allegedly slipped through the besiegers' lines. This led to legends that they escaped with a secret treasure or esoteric knowledge. In 1906, esoteric French writer Jos√©phin P√©ladan proposed that the treasure was really the Holy Grail, arguing that Monts√©gur was the Munsalv√§sche (or Montsalvat) of Wolfram von Eschenbach's 13th-century Grail romance Parzival. This idea was followed and expanded upon by various later writers, especially in France, and has inspired legends, conspiracy theories, and fictional works associating the Cathars and Monts√©gur with the Holy Grail.Wood, Juliette (2012). The Holy Grail: History and Legend, pp. 74‚Äì76. University of Wales Press. . =The later fortress= Monts√©gur from village The present fortress ruin at Monts√©gur is not from the Cathar era. The original Cathar fortress of Monts√©gur was entirely pulled down by the victorious royal forces after its capture in 1244. It was gradually rebuilt and upgraded over the next three centuries by royal forces. The current ruin so dramatically occupying the site, and featured in illustrations, is referred to by French archeologists as \\"Montsegur III\\" and is typical of post-medieval royal French defensive architecture of the 17th century. It is not \\"Montsegur II,\\" the structure in which the Cathars lived and were besieged, of which few traces remain today. Monts√©gur's solar alignment characteristics, visible on the morning of the summer solstice in particular, are part of what set this castle apart as an architectural wonder. This often mentioned solar phenomenon, occurring in an alignment of two windows in the fortress wall, has been observed by hundreds of students, astronomers, spiritual pilgrims and locals alike who come to the chateau specifically to view it every year and has been recorded and included in the documentary \\"The Otherworld,\\" (by Richard Stanley) in 2013. The Groupe de Recherches Arch√©ologiques de Monts√©gur et Environs (GRAME) (Archeological Research Group of Montsegur and Vicinity), which conducted a 13-year archeological excavation of Monts√©gur with minimal funds and the technology available at the time in 1964‚Äì76, concluded in its final report, which was not widely published, is not viewed as solid archeological research, and is hotly disputed by many, that: :\\"There remains no trace within the present-day ruins, neither of the first fortress which was abandoned before the 13th century (Montsegur I), nor of the one which was built by Raymond de P√©reille around 1210 (Montsegur II)...\\" (Il ne reste aucune trace dans les ruines actuelles ni du premier ch√¢teau qui √©tait √† l'abandon au d√©but du XIIIe si√®cle (Monts√©gur I), ni de celui que construisit Raimon de Pereilles vers 1210 (Monts√©gur II)...) The small ruins of the terraced dwellings, immediately outside the perimeter of the current fortress walls on the north-eastern flank are, however, confirmed to be traces of authentic former Cathar habitations.

The debit card has a similar model. Giros are primarily a European phenomenon; although electronic payment systems such as the Automated Clearing House exist in the United States and Canada, it is not possible to perform third party transfers with them. In the European Union, there is the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) which allows electronic giro or debit card payments in euros to be executed to any euro bank account in the area. In the United Kingdom and in other countries the term giro may refer to a specific system once operated by the post office.Oxford English Dictionary (online) In the UK, the giro service was originally known as National Giro. In due course \\"giro\\" was adopted by the public and the press as a shorthand term for the girocheque, which was a cheque and not a credit transfer. Meanwhile, there were Bank Giro Credits, which were instructions to credit a particular bank account: these were not instructions to debit another account, so they had to be accompanied with cash or cheques, and they could be used both for bill payments and as paying-in slips; when used for paying bills they were often free-of-charge to the payer when used at the payer's or payee's bank but with an administration charge at other banks. The use of cheques and paper giros is now in decline in many countriesFederal Reserve: Recent payment trends in the United States, 2008. \\"In 2003 the number of electronic payments in the US exceeded the number of cheque payments for the first time in favour of electronic payments, which are thought to be faster, cheaper and safer due to the reduced risk of fraud. The word 'Giro' is also used in Investment Giro, where 'Giro' is used for a non-bank, administrative account on which investments and transactions are registered. The word Giro in this context has its origin in the Netherlands. Giro is used in names like Investment Giro, Investor Giro, Securities Giro, and in Dutch for Beleggers giro, Beleggingsgiro and is used as synonymous for Investments or Investors administrations, Transfer Agents Services or for the Dutch 'Bewaarinstelling'. Etymology The word \\"giro\\" is borrowed from Dutch \\"giro\\" and/or German \\"giro\\", which are both from Italian \\"giro\\" meaning \\"circulation of money\\". The Italian term comes via Latin \\"gyrus\\" meaning \\"gyre\\" from the Greek \\"gyros\\" meaning \\"circle\\".Glyn Davies, National Giro History and concept Giro systems date back at least to Ptolemaic Egypt in the 4th century BC. State granary deposits functioned as an early banking system, in which giro payments were accepted, with a central bank in Alexandria.A Comparative Chronology of Money, Roy Davies & Glyn Davies, 1996 & 1999. Giro was a common method of money transfer in early banking. The first occurrences of book money are not known exactly. The giro system itself can be traced back to the \\"bancherii\\" in Northern Italy, especially on the Rialto (a financial center, resembling the modern day Wall Street). Originally these were money changers sitting at their desk (\\"bancus\\" = bench) that customers could turn to. They offered an additional service to keep the money and to allow direct transfer from one money store to another by checking the accounts in their storage books. Literally they opened one book, withdrew an amount, opened another book where the amount was added. This handling was naturally a very regional system but it allowed the money to circulate in the books. This led finally to the foundation of the \\"Banco del Giro\\" in 1619 (in Venetian language, Banco del Ziro) which gave the blueprint for similar banking systems. The usage in German language can be seen in the Banco del Giro founded in Vienna in 1703 (to extend the financing business that Samuel Oppenheimer had brought from Venice in 1670). Postal giro or postgiro systems have a long history in European financial services. The basic concept is that of a banking system not based on cheques, but rather by direct transfer between accounts. If the accounting office is centralised, then transfers between accounts can happen simultaneously. Money could be paid in or withdrawn from the system at any post office, and later connections to the commercial banking systems were established, often simply by the local bank opening its own postgiro account. By the middle of the 20th century, most countries in continental Europe had a postal giro service. The first postgiro system was established in Austria on the early 19th century. By the time the British postgiro was conceived, the Dutch postgiro was very well established with virtually every adult having a postgiro account, and very large and well used postgiro operations in most other countries in Europe. Banks also adopted the giro as a method of direct payment from remitter to receiver. The term \\"bank\\" was not used initially to describe the service. The banks' main payment instrument was based on the cheque which has a totally different remittance model than that of a giro. Model In the banking model, cheques are written by the paying party and then handed or mailed to the payee, who must then visit a bank or mail the cheque to his or her bank. The cheque must then be cleared, a complex process by which cheques are sorted once, mailed to a central clearing location, sorted again, and then mailed back to the paying branch, which verifies that the funds are available and pays the payee's bank. In the postal giro model, the paying party sends a request to pay the payee (called a giro transfer) to the giro centre, which verifies that the funds are available, debits the payer's accounts by the amount requested, and credits that amount to the payee's account. The giro centre then sends the giro transfer document to the recipient, and an updated account statement to both the payer and payee. In the case of large utilities receiving thousands of payments per day, statements are sent electronically and incorporate a unique reference number for each payment for reconciliation purposes. In the United States, the rise of electronic cheque clearing (and debit cards as preferred instruments of payment) has made this difference less important than it once was. In some stores in the United States checks are scanned at the cash register and handed back to the customer. The scanned information is forwarded to a payment processor, which transfers the money using the ACH Network. Unlike the banking model, the postal giro model allows an individual to transfer money directly into another individual's bank account, provided the sender has the recipient's account details. The recipient is not required to approve or acknowledge the transfer or visit the bank to claim it. As a result, cheques are rarely used in countries with extensive giro networks, such as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the Nordic countries. Direct deposit systems such as those in common use in North America, by contrast, require the recipient's explicit approval, typically provided by filling out a form. Transferring funds from one personal bank account to another typically requires either a physical check or a wire transfer, which may incur a significant fee and require the paying party to visit the bank. The credit risk with respect to the actual transfer of physical currency is assumed by the giro operators, such as banks, as interbank credit risk. For the payer and payee, giro does not involve credit, unlike cheques or credit cards. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage. The creditworthiness of the payer doesn't need to be evaluated, as he can initiate the transaction only if he already has sufficient funds. As such, the payer doesn't have the benefit of paying on credit. However, the disadvantage is that the transactions are unsecured. The payer lacks the sort of protections against dishonest payees that come with credit cards. Transactions cannot be recalled or disputed after the fact. Thus, committing fraud in e.g. interpersonal trade is relatively easy, and giro payments should be only made to known and trusted payees. Also, even though intra-bank transfer can be quick, interbank transfers can take several days, and they are often executed only on business days, unless both parties are members of an instant transfer system such as the UK Faster Payments Service. Electronic bill payment Modern electronic bill payment is similar to the use of giro. Advantages include: * Instant access to the funds via an ATM, debit card or cheque card. * There is no paper cheque that can be lost, stolen, or forgotten. * Payments made electronically can be less expensive to the payer; typically electronic payments may cost around $0.25¬¢ (US) whereas it could cost up to $2 (US) to generate, print and mail a paper cheque. Banks may not even charge for the service at all; for example many banks in the European Union charge nothing for electronic payments inside the SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area), provided the proper BIC and IBAN account numbers are used. * The payment error rates and subsequent reconciliation issues are significantly reduced. In the United States, the ACH Network, regulated by NACHA and the Federal Reserve Bank, handles all interbank transfers, including direct deposit and direct debit. In entirely electronic bill payment, the payer receives a bill ‚Äî either physically by mail or electronically from a website (electronic billing). Then, the payer reads in the information from the bill, either manually or by using the barcode on the bill (ex: EPC QR Code in the European Union), enters it to the form on the bank website, and submits the form. The payment is immediately deducted from the account balance. This is common in Sweden with giro invoices in the standard formats, which can be scanned by a mobile banking app, have their numbers manually typed in to a web form, or physically presented to a bank in the traditional manner. Cultural significance Before the use of electronic transfers of payments became the norm in the United Kingdom the fortnightly \\"giro\\" payment was the normal way of distributing benefit payments. When unemployment peaked in the 1980s, large numbers of people would receive their benefit payment on the same day leading the concept of Giro Day, marked by the settlement of small debts and a noticeable increase in drinking, partying, and festive activities. It is the focus of the 1996 film Waiting for Giro.

Blanket loans are popular with builders and developers who buy large tracts of land, then subdivide them to create many individual parcels to be gradually sold one at a time. Rather than securing a new mortgage each time a portion of the development is sold, the borrower uses the blanket loan to buy them all. Once a parcel is sold, a portion of the mortgage is released, with the rest of the mortgage remaining intact. Traditional mortgages typically have a \\"due-on-sale clause\\", which stipulates that if property secured by the mortgage is sold, the entire outstanding mortgage debt must be paid in full immediately. With a blanket mortgage, a ‚Äúrelease clause‚Äù allows the sale of portions of the secured property and corresponding partial repayment of the loan. This is done to facilitate purchases and sales of multiple units of property with the convenience of a single mortgage. A builder, for example, might use a blanket mortgage to pay for construction of several homes in one neighborhood. When a home is sold, the portion of the mortgage that was used to fund that home is paid back to the lender, and then retired. The remaining outstanding balance is adjusted accordingly, and the blanket mortgage continues phase by phase in that manner, until all houses are sold and the entire mortgage is repaid and retired.

Design and development The Bearhawk was designed as a personal project by Barrows to carry aircraft engines for delivery as freight. It features a strut-braced high-wing, a four- seat enclosed cabin that is wide and accessed by doors, fixed conventional landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration. The aircraft fuselage is made from welded steel tubing covered in doped aircraft fabric, while the wings are made from aluminum sheet. Its span wing employs a NACA 4412 mod airfoil, has an area of and mounts flaps. The aircraft's recommended engine power range is and standard engines used include the Lycoming O-360 and Lycoming O-540 four-stroke powerplants. Construction time from the supplied kit is 1200 hours. The prototype was fitted with a Lycoming O-360 burning automotive fuel. Operational history By October 2016, 77 examples had been registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration and 11 with Transport Canada.

The species was first described by Jean Baptiste Boisduval in 1875. Range Ceratomia catalpae is a native of southeastern North America and can be located on catalpa trees that grow within this region. It can be found from Maine, west to Iowa, south to Florida, the Gulf States and Texas. Life cycle From oviposition of the eggs to pupation, about four weeks will pass. Where multiple broods occur, pupae will eclose in two weeks, or when conditions are suitable. Adult C. catalpae do not reflect the wonderful colors of their larvae. They are a dull brown color lacking the show-off appearance of its larval stages. =Egg= Translucent, milky-white, green, or yellowish eggs are oval, being about 0.5 mm in diameter. Eggs are deposited in masses of 100-1000 eggs on the undersurface of leaves, while smaller masses are deposited onto branches on the catalpa tree. Eggs incubate and hatch five to seven days after oviposition. =Larva= The larval stage of C. catalpae is known as the catalpa or catawba worm. When first hatching, the larvae are very pale, but become darker toward the last instars. The yellow caterpillars will usually have a dark, black stripe down their back along with black dots along their sides. There is also a \\"pale\\" phase where the black striping is not as prevalent or missing altogether and a shade of white has replaced it. They grow to a length of about and feed on the leaves of the northern catalpa and, more commonly, the southern catalpa, also known as catawba or Indian bean trees. They are highly desired by fishermen as bait. =Pupa= Like most other Sphingidae, Ceratomia catalpae will burrow into the ground after its fifth and final instar in order to pupate. The larvae will go into a \\"wandering\\" stage where it leaves the catalpa tree and climbs to the ground to find a place to bury itself so that it may pupate. The larvae will then shed its fifth instar skin to reveal its pupal skin, which will be soft and almost translucent at first, but will then harden to a light brown for protection from the elements. =Adult= The adult catalpa sphinx is brown with a circular band of dark brown or black surrounding its thorax. Each forewing has a small, dark mark towards the middle, with a white dot in the cell. The body is approximately 30 mm long. The wingspan is 65‚Äì95 mm. =Images of life cycle= Image:Caeratomia catalpae first instar.JPG Two C. catalpae in their first instar Image:Ceratomia catalpae.jpg Catalpa sphinx resting Image:Ceratomia catalpaePCCA20040801-3816A.jpg C. catalpae adult Food plants C. catalpae can be quite harmful to the catalpa tree during large outbreaks. The first trial of aerial crop dusting was an attempt to control the catalpa sphinx. However, more recent research may indicate the caterpillars are not as harmful as once thought. The research of Stephen L. Peele, curator of the Florida Mycology Research Center, indicates that catalpa trees might be completely defoliated multiple times during a single summer yet still survive and return to full health, a process which, Peele says, no other tree could survive. \\"They always come back. They always look healthy,\\" says Peele. \\"I have tried to understand the possible symbiotic relationship between the worm and the tree. There surely must be one.\\"http://www.motherearthnews.com/homesteading-and-livestock/catalpa-worms- zbcz1306 *Catalpa bignonioides, (southern catalpa) *Catalpa speciosa, (northern catalpa) References External links *Catalpa sphinx, Moths of North America *Ceratomia catalpae, Sphingidae of the Americas Category:Ceratomia Category:Moths described in 1875 Category:Moths of Canada ","title":"Ceratomia catalpae"},{"id":"923928","text":"General elections were held in the Netherlands on 25 May 1977.Dieter Nohlen & Philip St√∂ver (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p1396 The Labour Party remained the largest party, winning 53 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives.Nohlen & St√∂ver, p1414 Following the election, it took 208 days of negotiations to form a new government.

It merges with Hecate Strait in the north and Queen Charlotte Strait in the south.Queen Charlotte Sound , Columbia Gazetteer of North America Queen Charlotte Sound is part of the Inside Passage shipping route. Definition According to the BCGNIS, the northern boundary of Queen Charlotte Sound is defined as a line running from the southernmost point of Price Island to Cape St James on Kunghit Island, the southernmost point of Haida Gwaii. The western boundary is a line from Cape St James to Cape Scott at the north end of Vancouver Island. The southern boundary runs along the coast of Vancouver Island from Cape Scott to Cape Sutil, then to Cape Caution on the mainland. An older definition placed the northern boundary as a line from the southernmost point of Aristazabal Island to Cape St James. History Queen Charlotte Sound was named by James Strange on August 5, 1786, in honour of Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the wife of King George III. Strange was the leader of a fur trading expedition of two vessels, Captain Cook, under Captain Henry Lawrie, and Experiment, under Captain John Guise. During a boat excursion up Goletas Channel Strange saw an opening ahead and named it Queen Charlotte Sound. The body of water he named was what is today known as Queen Charlotte Strait. For some time Queen Charlotte Strait was also called Queen Charlotte Sound, until 1920 when the BCGNIS and Hydrographic Service distinguished between Queen Charlotte Sound and Queen Charlotte Strait. George Vancouver, who used the name in his maps and writings, wrote that the sound was named by Mr. S. Wedgeborough, in command of the Experiment under James Strange, but Vancouver was wrong--Strange was the one who gave the name.

To the west of the Capitol extends the National Mall, visible as a slight green band in the image. The Southwest quadrant is the smallest, located mostly on a fairly narrow strip of land along the Potomac River, which is the large river in the map running from the upper left corner to the center of the bottom of the image. Southwest (SW or S.W.) is the southwestern quadrant of Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States, and is located south of the National Mall and west of South Capitol Street. It is the smallest quadrant of the city, and contains a small number of named neighborhoods and districts, including Bellevue, Southwest Federal Center, the Southwest Waterfront, Buzzard Point, and the military installation known as Joint Base Anacostia‚ÄìBolling. Geography Southwest has the following districts and neighborhoods: *the Southwest Federal Center, also called the Southwest Employment District, is the area between the National Mall and the Southeast/Southwest Freeway (Interstate 395). **Southwest Federal Center contains the Smithsonian Institution museums along the south side of the Mall--including the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the National Museum of African Art, the Freer Gallery of Art, the Arthur M.

McNair. **Southwest Waterfront is a primarily residential neighborhood. It also is home to several Washington DC marinas, including the Washington Marina, The Capitol Yacht Club, the Gangplank Marina, and the James Creek Marina. **It is also home to the Maine Avenue Fish Market, Arena Stage, the Washington Marina, Fort McNair, and Hains Point; East and West Potomac Park, a conjunction of two national parks between I-395 and the National Mall that contain the Tidal Basin, the Jefferson Memorial, and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial (West Potomac Park continues into Northwest and includes the Lincoln Memorial and World War II Memorial, both of which straddle the Southwest/Northwest boundary); **Southwest Waterfront is in Ward 6, except for the unpopulated East and West Potomac Parks, which are in Ward 2. *Buzzard Point, a largely under-developed industrial area between South Capitol Street and Fort McNair. **Buzzard Point contains Audi Field, home of local MLS team D.C.

Prior to 2013, Buzzard Point was the home of the U.S. Coast Guard, which was headquartered in a building at the confluence of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers. The headquarters then moved to the former St. Elizabeths Hospital campus in Southeast Washington near Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling to a building renamed the Douglas A. Munro Coast Guard Headquarters Building. *the area of Southwest that is south and east of the Anacostia River contains Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling together with the Naval Research Laboratory and the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant, Job Corps Center, and Fire Department Training Center. **Bolling is in Ward 8. *the Bellevue neighborhood occupies all of the Southwest land between South Capitol Street (to the east) and the Anacostia and Potomac rivers (to the west and north). Included is the small Hadley Hospital. **Bellevue is in Ward 8. =Transportation= The Blue, Orange, and Silver lines of the Washington Metro have the following stations in the Southwest Federal Center: Smithsonian, L'Enfant Plaza, and Federal Center SW. The Green line has a stop in the Southwest Federal Center at L'Enfant Plaza and in the Southwest Waterfront at Waterfront; additionally, the Navy Yard ‚Äì Ballpark stop is one block outside the eastern boundary of the Southwest Waterfront neighborhood. History =Before 1950= Southwest is part of Pierre L'Enfant's original city plans and includes some of the oldest buildings in the city, including the Wheat Row block of townhouses, built in 1793, and Fort McNair, which was established in 1791 as \\"the U.S. Arsenal at Greenleaf Point.\\" Before 1847, much of the Virginia portion of the District of Columbia, including the town of Alexandria, was included in Southwest. After the Civil War, the Southwest Waterfront became a neighborhood for the poorer classes of Washingtonians. The neighborhood was divided in half by Fourth Street SW, then known as 4 Street; Scotch, Irish, German, and eastern European immigrants lived west of 4 Street, while freed blacks lived to the east. Each half was centered on religious establishments: St. Dominic's Catholic Church and Talmud Torah Congregation on the west, and Friendship Baptist Church on the east. (Also, each half of the neighborhood was the childhood home of a future American musical star -- the first home of Al Jolson, whose father was the cantor of Talmud Torah Congregation, after his family emigrated from what is now Lithuania was on 4 Street, and Marvin Gaye was born in a tenement on First Street.) 12th St. tunnel under I-395 in Southwest Washington Waterfront developed into a quite contradictory area: it had a thriving commercial district with grocery stores, shops, a movie theater, as well as a few large and elaborate houses (mostly owned by wealthy blacks). However, most of the neighborhood was a very poor shantytown of tenements, shacks, and even tents. These places, some of them in the shadow of the Capitol Building, were frequent subjects of photographs highlighting the stark contrast.(1) (2) =1950s rebuilding= In the 1950s, city planners working with the U.S. Congress decided that Southwest should undergo a significant urban renewal -- in this case, meaning that the city would declare eminent domain over all land south of the National Mall and north of the Anacostia River (except Fort McNair); evict virtually all of its residents and businesses; destroy all streets, buildings, and landscapes; and start again from scratch. The seizure of the entire area, including well maintained properties, was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in Berman v. Parker. Justice William Douglas emphasized the squalor and segregation the area suffered, noting that the area was 98% black while 58% of dwellings had outside toilets.Berman v. Parker, 384 U.S. 26 (1954). Only a few buildings were left intact, notably the Maine Avenue fish market, the Wheat Row townhouses, the Thomas Law House, and the St. Dominic's and Friendship churches. The Southeast/Southwest Freeway was constructed where F Street, SW, had once been. The rebuilt Southwest featured a large concentration of office and residential buildings in the brutalist style that was then popular. It was during this time that most of the Southwest Federal Center was built. The heart of the urban renewal of the Southwest Waterfront was Waterside Mall, a small shopping center and office complex, which housed satellite offices for the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The Arena Stage was built a block west of the Mall, and a number of hotels and restaurants were built on the riverfront to attract tourists. Southeastern University, a very small college that had been chartered in 1937, also established itself as an important institution in the area. Following a proposal by Chloethiel Woodard Smith and Louis Justement, renewal in Southwest marked one of the last great efforts of the late Modernist movement. Architect I. M. Pei developed the initial urban renewal plan and was responsible for the design of multiple buildings, including those comprising L‚ÄôEnfant Plaza and two clusters of apartment buildings located on the north side of M St. SW (initial termed Town Center Plaza). Various firms oversaw individual projects and many of these represent significant architectural contributions. Noted modernist Charles M. Goodman designed the River Park Mutual Homes complex. Likewise, Harry Weese designed the new building for Arena Stage and Marcel Breuer the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building (located at 451 Seventh Street, SW) to house the newly established United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Hubert H. Humphrey Federal Building. The Tiber Island complex (the design of which was essentially replicated in the adjacent projects that are now termed Carrollsburg A Condominium and Carrollsburg Square), which was designed by Keyes, Lethbridge & Condon, won an American Institute of Architects Honor Award in 1966. However, urban renewal did not fully succeed in Southwest for many of the reasons that plagued other Modernist renewal efforts. Areas of the neighborhood remained run-down, low-income, and somewhat dangerous. This situation intensified in the 1980s and the 1990s, when Washington had among the lowest per capita incomes and highest crime rates in the nation. The Southwest urban renewal has been called \\"a case study of everything urban renewal got wrong about cities and people.\\"Do posh waterfronts make a city world-class? D.C. is betting hundreds of millions on it., The Washington Post, June 26, 2018 =Recent redevelopment= While many of the residential neighborhoods of Southwest remained both highly mixed-race and mixed-income, around 2003, the wave of new development occurring throughout D.C. reached Southwest including a number of apartment building renovations and condominium conversions. Nationals Park stadium, located on the east side of South Capitol Street and thus in Southeast, opened for the Washington Nationals Major League Baseball team in 2008, construction having cost more than $611 million. As part of the Capitol Riverfront revitalization efforts, high rise office buildings and condominiums have been constructed. Developers have created a waterfront greenspace The Yards, and a waterfront bike trail is planned. Public Housing projects continue to occupy the area between the Waterfront metro and the Nationals Park stadium. On April 16, 2010, the new Waterfront Safeway (including a sushi bar) and a Starbucks opened for business. Along Water Street, \\"The Wharf\\" includes restaurants, shopping, theaters, public piers, hotels, and high-rise housing; the first phase opened in October 2017 (see Redevelopment of Southwest Waterfront) with phase two slated to deliver in early 2022.(1) (2) (3) (4) L'Enfant Plaza is also undergoing a facelift, with new retail and hotels, as well as office renovations. In April 2017, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) approved plans for a staircase and ramp that will travel through a grassy slope in Benjamin Banneker Park to connect L'Enfant Plaza to the Southwest Waterfront and to add lighting and trees to the area. The NCPC and the National Park Service intended the project to be an interim improvement that could be in place for ten years while the area awaits redevelopment.(1) (2) (3) (4) Hoffman-Madison Waterfront (the developer of \\"The Wharf\\") and the District of Columbia government agreed to invest $4 million in the project in an effort to improve neighborhood connectivity in the area. Construction began on the project in September 2017.

Boundary dispute The so-called \\"A‚ÄìB\\" line (approximately 54¬∞40'N), which marks the northern boundary of the Dixon Entrance, was delineated by a court of arbitration set up by the 1903 Alaska Boundary Treaty. The meaning of the line remains in dispute between Canada and the United States. Canada claims the line is the international maritime boundary, while the United States holds that its purpose was only to designate the land masses belonging to each country. Hence, the U.S. does not recognize the \\"A‚ÄìB\\" line as an official boundary (to govern, for example, seafloor resources or fishing rights). In 1977 the U.S. defined a maritime boundary as an equidistant line between land masses. The two differing boundary lines intersect to create four separate water areas with different claim status. The two areas south of the \\"A‚ÄìB\\" line (about 2789 km2 and 51.5 km2 in size) are claimed by both countries. The other two water areas are north of the \\"A‚ÄìB\\" line and are not claimed by either country. The two unclaimed areas are about 72 km2 and 1.4 km2 in size. In addition, Nunez Rocks is a low-tide elevation (LTE) (\\"bare at half-tide\\") that lies south of the \\"A‚ÄìB\\" Line, surrounded by the sea territory claimed by the U.S. The United States has not ratified the Law of the Sea Treaty, although it adheres to most of its principles as customary international law. Under the treaty, LTEs may be used as basepoints for a territorial sea, and the U.S. uses Nunez Rocks as a basepoint. As a non-signatory, however, there is nothing preventing the U.S. from claiming areas beyond the scope of the Law of the Sea Treaty. The fact remains that, for about half of each day, above-water territory that Canada regards as Canadian is surrounded by sea territory that the U.S. has declared to be American. Territorial fishing disputes between the countries remain today, as the United States has never shown the \\"A‚ÄìB\\" line as an official boundary on its government maps.

It merges with Queen Charlotte Sound to the south and Dixon Entrance to the north. About wide at its southern end, Hecate Strait narrows in the north to about . It is about in length.Hecate Strait , Columbia Gazetteer of North America Definition According to the BCGNIS, the southern boundary of Hecate Strait is defined as a line running from the southernmost point of Price Island to Cape St James on Kunghit Island, the southernmost point of Haida Gwaii. The northern boundary is a line from Rose Point, the northeastern tip of Graham Island, to Hooper Point at the north end of Stephens Island off the mainland. History Hecate Strait, because it is so shallow, is especially susceptible to storms and violent weather. The Haida crossed the Hecate Strait to the mainland to plunder coastal villages to take slaves and booty. Only the Haida knew the real nature of the Strait's workings, and so could not be followed by the tribes of the mainland. Hecate Strait, therefore, was one of the main defenses of the Haida people from attack. Hecate Strait was named by Captain George Henry Richards in 1861 or 1862 after his surveying vessel, HMS Hecate. Geology During the last Ice Age, the seafloor in this area was a wide coastal plain stretching south to the Olympic Peninsula and including what is now Queen Charlotte Sound. Flora and fauna The strait once contained strong salmon and halibut fisheries. Hecate Strait is one of the few locations in the world with species from the glass sponge class of fauna. Regions with these sponge are currently protected from damage by commercial fishing.Glass Sponge Reefs Living Oceans Society The Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound Glass Sponge Reefs Marine Protected Area was designated by the Fisheries and Oceans Canada in February 2017. The MPA is located in the Northern Shelf bioregion of the Pacific Region, southeast of Haida Gwaii, North and South of the entrance to the Douglas Channel. The MPA is composed of three individual areas known as the Northern Reef, the Central Reefs, and the Southern Reef. Together these three areas cover approximately 2,410 square kilometers. The four reef complexes in the Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound discontinuously cover an area of about 1,000 km2, and are located in glacial troughs between 140 m and 240 m deep.

Shortly thereafter, the division removed to Camp Van Dorn, Mississippi to prepare for deployment to Europe. On three occasions during the next seventeen months, the division trained up fresh recruits into effective combat teams, only to have them pulled from the division and sent overseas as replacements. The first elements of the division, anxious to get in the fight, finally arrived in Europe in December 1944 and were joined by the rest of the division in January 1945. =Order of Battle= Triangular Division example: 1942 U.S. infantry division.

More attached and detached units are listed here: =In action= Three regiments of the 63rd Division arrived in Marseille, France, 8 December 1944, trained at Haguenau and, under the designation Task Force Harris, protected the east flank of the Seventh Army along the Rhine River. The task force fought defensively from 22 to 30 December 1944. On 30 December 44, while the 253d Inf Regt was attached to the 44th Inf Div and the 255th Inf Regt was attached to the 100th Inf Div, the 254th Inf Regt was moved to the Colmar area of France where it was attached to the 3d Inf Div which was at the time a part of the First French Army. The infantry regiments remained with their attachments until early February 1945. The rest of the division arrived at Marseilles, 14 January 1945, and moved to Willerwald on 2 February, where it was joined by the advance elements on 6 February. On 7 February, the 63rd conducted local raids and patrols, then pushed forward, crossing the Saar River on 17 February, and mopping up the enemy in Muhlen Woods. After bitter fighting at G√ºdingen early in March, the division smashed at the Siegfried Line on 15th at Saarbr√ºcken, Germany, taking Ormesheim and finally breaching the line at Sankt Ingbert and Hassel on 20 March. Hard fighting still lay ahead, but the Siegfried Line was Germany's last attempt to defend its prewar boundaries along the western front. Before resting on 23 March, the 63d took Spiesen- Elversberg, Neunkirchen and Erbach. From then until the end of the war, the 63d Division carved a path of \\"blood and fire\\" from Sarreguemines through Germany. On 28 March, the division crossed the Rhine at Lampertheim, moved to Viernheim and captured Heidelberg on 30 March. Continuing the advance, the 63rd crossed the Neckar River near Mosbach and the Jagst River The 253rd Infantry Regiment, received the majority of the German resistance during this time at the Battle of Buchhof and Stein am Kocher.The Battle of Buchhof and Stein am Kocher: The story of Second Battalion 253rd Infantry Regiment. 2014 Timothy A. Malone Heavy resistance slowed the attack on Adelsheim, M√∂ckm√ºhl, and Bad Wimpfen. The division switched to the southeast, capturing Lampoldshausen and clearing the Harth√§user Woods on 7 April. A bridgehead was secured over the Kocher River near Wei√übach on 8 April, and Schw√§bisch Hall fell on 17 April. Advance elements crossed the Rems River and rushed to the Danube. The Danube was crossed on 25 April, and Leipheim fell before the division was withdrawn from the line on 28 April, and assigned security duty from the Rhine to Darmstadt and W√ºrzburg on a line to Stuttgart and Speyer. The 63d began leaving for home on 21 August 1945, and was inactivated on 27 September 1945. From mid-February 1945 until the end of the war, the 63rd Infantry Division made a path of Blood and Fire from Sarreguemines through the Siegfried Line to Worms, Mannheim, Heidelberg, Gunzburg and ending in Landsberg Germany at the end of April 1945 when the division was pulled from the line for a much needed rest.http://www.63rdinfdiv.com/divisionhistorypage1.html =Casualties= *Total battle casualties: 4,502Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Killed in action: 861 *Wounded in action: 3,326 *Missing in action: 98 *Prisoner of war: 219  Post-war History (1945‚Äì1962)  *Headquarters, 63rd Infantry Division ** Inactivated 27 September 1945 at Camp Myles Standish, Massachusetts. ** Assigned 1 March 1952 to the Sixth Army. ** Activated 1 March 1952 at Los Angeles, California (reflagged from 13th Armored Division. ** Reorganized and redesignated 31 March 1959 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 63rd Infantry Division. ** Location changed 27 March 1960 to Bell, California. ** Inactivated 31 December 1965 at Bell, California.

Army Reserve The 63rd Infantry Division was reactivated in February 1952 as a unit reflagged from the 13th Armored Division, and assigned to the Army Reserve, with headquarters in Los Angeles, California. The division was again inactivated in December 1965, and the colors were transferred to the 63rd Reinforcement Training Unit. On 1 January 1968, the 63rd Army Reserve Command (ARCOM) was activated and, as an exception to policy, allowed to wear the shoulder sleeve insignia and distinctive unit insignia of the 63rd Infantry Division. The 63rd ARCOM did not, however, perpetuate the lineage and honors of the 63rd Infantry Division, as Department of the Army policy does not authorize TDA units, such as ARCOMs, to inherit the lineage and honors of TO&E; units, such as divisions. Based at Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center, the command encompassed Army Reserve units in Southern California, Arizona, and Nevada. From 1990 through 1991, over 2,500 Army Reserve soldiers from the 63rd ARCOM served on active duty in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. Twenty-two of the command's units were mobilized, with fourteen of them deploying to the Persian Gulf. In April 1995, the 63rd ARCOM was redesignated as the 63rd Regional Support Command (later revised to Regional Readiness Command), and its geographic boundaries were realigned to coincide with those of Federal Emergency Management Agency Region IX. The 63rd maintained command and control of 14,000 soldiers and 140 units in the states of California, Arizona and Nevada, and assumed additional responsibility to support the major functional reserve commands within its area. The 63rd RRC supported both foreign and domestic active Army missions, including participation in NATO operations in Bosnia and Kosovo. Since 2001, thousands of soldiers from the 63rd RRC have served in Afghanistan and Iraq. In September 2008, the 63rd and 90th Regional Readiness Commands combined into the 63rd which was redesignated the 63rd Regional Support Command again, with its new headquarters at Moffett Field, California. As a key component of the Army Reserve's transition to an operational force, the newly formed 63rd RSC has foregone command and control of units in favor if a greatly expanded area of responsibility. The 63rd RSC provides base support and administrative support to over 40,000 Army Reserve soldiers in the southwest United States. Insignia * Shoulder sleeve insignia: ** Description: On a tear-drop-shaped olive drab background 5.72 cm (2¬º in.) wide and 8.89 cm (3¬Ω in.) long, a scarlet flame of five rays superimposed by an upright gold sword in pale, charged with a scarlet drop of blood. ** Symbolism: The design alludes to the unit's motto, \\"Blood and Fire\\" (see below). *** Background: The shoulder sleeve insignia was designed by the division's first commander, Brigadier General Louis E. Hibbs. It was originally approved for the 63d Infantry Division on 27 March 1943. It was authorized for the 63d Army Reserve Command on 22 April 1968. It was reassigned and authorized effective 16 April 1996, for the 63d Regional Support Command. The insignia was redesignated effective 16 July 2003, for the 63d Regional Readiness Command. It was redesignated effective 17 September 2008, for the 63d Regional Support Command and amended to add a symbolism. * Distinctive unit insignia: ** Description: A silver color metal and enamel device, 3.02 cm (1 3/16 in.) in diameter, consisting of a silver chevron on a red background, bearing seven blue wavy vertical bands; in base, a black embattled area with two merlons; encircling all, a continuous silver scroll of four folds inscribed on the upper three folds, \\"PRIDE\\" \\"HONOR\\" \\"SERVICE\\" in black letters. Overall, a yellow vertical sword, the tip charged with a scarlet drop. ** Symbolism: The elements of the design reflect the history of the 63d Infantry Division. The silver chevron simulates a spearhead and is indicative of the aggressiveness displayed by the 63rd Infantry Division during the crossing of seven European rivers‚Äîthe Saar, Rhine, Neckar, Jagst, Kocker, Rems, and Danube‚Äîduring World War II. The rivers are represented by the seven blue wavy bands. The breaching of the Siegfried Line at Sankt Ingbert and Hassell is symbolized by the two black merlons of the embattled area, surmounted by the yellow sword with the scarlet drop taken from the shoulder sleeve insignia of the organization. ** Background: The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 63d Army Reserve Command on 8 May 1970. It was reassigned and authorized effective 16 April 1996, for the 63d Regional Support Command. The insignia was redesignated for the 63d Regional Readiness Command effective 16 July 2003. It was redesignated effective 17 September 2008, for the 63d Regional Support Command. * Motto: \\"Blood and Fire,\\" inspired by a quote of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. At the Casablanca Conference in 1943, shortly before the activation of the 63d Infantry Division, Churchill promised to make the enemy \\"bleed and burn in expiation of their crimes.\\" The slogan was adopted by Brigadier General Louis E. Hibbs, the division's first commander, who designed the shoulder sleeve insignia.

Bjelovar, Croatian State Archives and the State Archives in Bjelovar, 2003, pp 11‚Äì19 After the drop of the Ottoman Empire domination, Bjelovar (named Bellowar before 1850Handbook of Austria and Lombardy-Venetia Cancellations on the Postage Stamp Issues 1850-1864, by Edwin MUELLER, 1961. ) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Kingdom of Croatia- Slavonia after the compromise of 1867), in the Croatian Military Frontier, Warasdin-Kreutzer Regiment N¬∞V until 1881. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Bjelovar was the seat of the Bjelovar-Kri≈æevci County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. From 1929 to 1939, Bjelovar was part of the Sava Banovina and from 1939 to 1941 of the Banovina of Croatia within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

It is the capital of the Bjelovar-Bilogora county, and the natural, cultural and political centre of the area. Bjelovar is at an intersection of roads in this area: the D28 intersects with the D43, and it lies on the road between Zagreb and west Slavonia, Podravina and Osijek. Bjelovar is currently being connected by dual carriageway with Zagreb. The city of Bjelovar has an area of , and administratively it includes 31 other areas. North-east of Bjelovar there is a long, low elevation called Bilogora, with an average height of 150‚Äì200 m (highest point: Rajƒçevica, 309 m). The geology of the area consists of Pliocene sandy marl and sandstones with lesser layers of lignite. Older rocks do not appear on the surface in this area. In deep boreholes there are crystalline rocks. =Climate= Bjelovar has a temperate continental climate. Winters are moderately cold and summers are warm. Precipitation of about per year is normal. The prevailing wind during winter is northerly, with easterlies becoming stronger in spring, when it may be quite cold, often blowing for several days consecutively. In summer the wind is southerly; it is warm and more humid. The mean yearly temperature in Bjelovar is about . Culture Bjelovar contains three war memorials. The Barutana memorial area is dedicated to those who died defending the city on September 29, 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence. The Lug memorial area is dedicated to Ustashi soldiers killed by Partisans in 1945, and the Borik memorial area is dedicated to Partisans killed during the Second World War. Bjelovar hosts the yearly \\"BOK\\" (Bjelovarski odjeci kazali≈°ta or Bjelovar Echoes of Theatre) theatre festival. It was founded and is run by Bjelovar actor Goran Navojec, and it hosts a selection of the best plays performed in Croatia during previous year. The building of a former synagogue in now used as a cultural center, the Bjelovar Synagogue. Sport In the 1970s, Bjelovar was known as the handball capital of Europe, when its local squad RK Bjelovar (under the name Partizan) dominated Croatian, Yugoslav, and European handball. The team came solely from Bjelovar and its environs.

It is west of Consett. It is one of the biggest inland waters in England. It is 3.5 miles (5.6 km) long) and covers an area of 4 km¬≤ and has a maximum depth of 100 ft (30m) and when full, holds 11,000 million gallons (50,000,000m¬≥). The reservoir is a key part of the water supply network in north east England (which is owned and managed by Northumbrian Water) as it is the principal water source for the Tyne and Wear metropolitan area supplying per day. The reservoir was first proposed in 1957 when the Sunderland and South Shields Water Company promoted the Derwent Water Order. Building work began on the reservoir in 1960, and it was opened in July 1967 by Princess Alexandra. Unlike other reservoirs in Northern England that are flooded valleys with a dam head, Derwent was dug out of the ground and the earth removed was used in its dam head. The flow of the River Derwent can be supplemented, when necessary, by water transferred from the much larger Kielder Water in Northumberland. However this cannot top up the reservoir itself. Sediment within the reservoir has been found to contain elevated levels of zinc, lead and cadmium. These have drained into the reservoir from areas of previous mining activity around Blanchland. Consequently, populations of macroscopic plants in the reservoir are relatively low.Harding, JPC, Whitten, BA (1978) Zinc, Cadmium and Lead in Water, Sediment and Submerged Plants of the Derwent Reservoir, Northern England. Water Research, Vol. 12, p307-316. Derwent Reservoir also hosts a sailing club, which holds many events throughout the year, including windsurfing, sailing, running and triathlons. The area around the reservoir hosts the annual Tour of the Reservoir cycle race. The reservoir also has hydro electric plant installed, with a rating of 97 kilowatts.

Members of this party are called Charterites. Party organizers prefer the term Charter Committee rather than Charter Party. Because of Ohio State laws regarding vote percentage cutoffs for official party recognition, the Charter Party is not an officially-recognized political party in Ohio.  History  The Charter Party claims to be \\"the oldest third party in the nation that has continually elected officials to office\\". It was founded in 1924, during a time when Cincinnati government was under the control of the Republican Party. Cincinnati was infamous for being the most corruptly governed major city in the United States, the era of Boss Cox (established by George Cox in the 1880s), controlled then by his prot√©g√© Rudolph Hynicka, who spent most of his time in New York in the management of the Columbia Burlesque Circuit. Republican reformers, led by members of the Republican Executive and Advisory Committee, then began the Cincinnatus Association. In 1923, Republican lawyer Murray Seasongood became the leader of the reformers' successful anti-tax campaign. The Cincinnatus Association then led to the formation of the Birdless Ballot League, which advocated nonpartisan elections. (The term \\"birdless\\" referred to the use of the Republican eagle and Democratic rooster as party symbols on the ballot). In 1924, the Birdless Ballot League joined with other reformers to create the City Charter Committee. The pre-1925 charter established a 32-member city council, six of whom were elected at-large. Only candidates nominated in a citywide primary by the Republican and Democratic parties were eligible to run. In 1924, there were 31 Republicans and one Democrat on the council. Between 1913 and 1925, only five Democrats had managed to get elected to the council. The real power behind government was held by Hynicka's Republican Central Committee, comprising Republican ward and township captains, which held the real power in the Republican party, to the disadvantage of the Executive and Advisory Committee. The new municipal charter enacted in 1925 as part of the Charterite movement established a Council-Manager form of government (abolishing the mayor-council system) and a civil service bureaucracy to replace political patronage. The new charter, which created a nine-member council, also mandated nonpartisan municipal elections and proportional representation with preference-ranked voting. With Democrats running on the Charter ticket, the first election following adoption of the council resulted in the election of six Charterites to the council. Democrat Ed Dixon, who had won more votes than Seasongood, and, therefore, should automatically have become mayor under the new charter, was persuaded to allow the leader of the reform movement to become the first mayor under the new charter. Although the Charter movement started with Republican reformers like Seasongood, the movement quickly became informally allied with the Democratic party against the Republican machine. Democratic candidates ran as Charterites. By the 1950s, Republicans fought the Charterites by plastering them with the label of socialism. In 1957, the Republicans successfully overturned proportional representation. It is believed that this was done to prevent the election of Theodore M. Berry as the city's first black mayor. In 1959, Democrats broke off from the Charterite coalition. Splitting the progressive vote with the Democrats throughout the 1960s, the Charterites barely survived the return of Republican rule, with Charles Phelps Taft II its only elected official by 1961. In 1963, Berry joined Taft on the council. In 1969, the Charterites joined with the Democrats in a formal coalition that successfully took control of city government in 1971. The coalition was led at times both by Charterites (Bobbie L. Sterne and Charles Phelps Taft II) and by Democrats (Tom Luken and Jerry Springer). From 1973, the two parties divided the two-year mayoral term into two one-year periods that alternated between them. Tom Luken's son, Charlie Luken ended the Democratic-Charterite coalition in 1985 when Arn Bortz was the only Charterite left on the council. In 1983 Marian Spencer was the first African American female elected to Cincinnati City Council and served as Vice Mayor and as a member of the Charter Party for one term. Sterne, who lost her seat in 1985, made a comeback in 1987. Bortz left politics in 1988 to concentrate on business, but anointed as his successor the popular professional football player Reggie Williams. Williams stayed for only two years. When Charterite Tyrone Yates became a Democrat in preparation for running for the state legislature, Sterne found herself again the sole Charterite on the council. Term limits prevented Sterne from running again in 1999, so she resigned her seat in 1998 in favor of restaurateur Jim Tarbell. Over the years, Charterites pursued a number of liberal and progressive causes, including reducing pollution and establishing cost-of- living wage increases for municipal employees. The Charterites instituted the now-common requirement of maintaining a public inventory of municipal property. Another Charterite initiative that has spread throughout the country requires private employers to inform employees of the risks of handling hazardous materials, known as a right-to-know law. The Charter Party reached its height of power in the 1950s, when it ran city government with Democrats running on the Charter ticket. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Charter Party formed a coalition municipal government with the Democrats. The coalition lasted until 1986. In recent years, the Charter Party has sought to expand beyond the Cincinnati city limits, endorsing candidates in neighboring jurisdictions, such as Covington, Kentucky. The Charter Party includes Democrats as well as Republicans and independents. The Charter Party advocates an activist government to address public problems and its main power base has been among the progressive-minded, educated, affluent senior citizens of Cincinnati. The party is currently making efforts to appeal to younger voters. The party has also turned its sights on establishing regional government. The last Charterite mayor of Cincinnati was Arn Bortz. The party was nearly extinguished in the 1990s. From 1993 to 2003, the city council had only one Charterite member. Currently, there are three Charterite members of the city council, Yvette Simpson, Kevin Flynn, and Amy Murray. The Charter Party slowly expands throughout the Greater Cincinnati area. As of January 1, 2003, the current president of the Charter Committee is Michael Goldman. The previous president was Gerald Newfarmer.  Platform  The party disavows any interest in competing for office beyond the local area. It accepts both Democratic and Republican members on its volunteer board of directors. The current party platform includes opposing the elimination of the municipal Planning Department and the Office of Environmental Management. The party, long allied with liberal Democratic interests, finds itself opposing the current wave of business-allied \\"new\\" Democrats, such as former Mayor Charlie Luken. Recent policy statements by Goldman, quoted by The Cincinnati Enquirer in a January 6, 2003, article by Gregory Korte: :\\"Charlie Luken thinks we're going to have a more 'developer friendly' city. Is that going to be at the expense of the residents? The city needs to be friendly to everyone.\\" :\\"If you look at progressive cities that are successful, you don't see them turning back the clock on environmental issues.\\" :\\"Nobody wants to talk about this, but let's look at the cities around us: Indianapolis. Columbus. Even Louisville. They all have some form of metropolitan government. All those cities have moved in that direction, and they're seen as successes.\\" The Charter Committee generally favors public transportation, city parks, and funding for jail and treatment services.

It has its headquarters in Ketchikan, Alaska. The Alaska Marine Highway System operates along the south-central coast of the state, the eastern Aleutian Islands and the Inside Passage of Alaska and British Columbia, Canada. Ferries serve communities in Southeast Alaska that have no road access, and the vessels can transport people, freight, and vehicles. AMHS's of routes go as far south as Bellingham, Washington, in the contiguous United States and as far west as Unalaska/Dutch Harbor, with a total of 32 terminals throughout Alaska, British Columbia, and Washington. It is part of the National Highway System and receives federal highway funding. It is also the only method of transportation of vehicles between the state and the contiguous United States, going through Canada but not requiring international customs and immigration. The Alaska Marine Highway System is a rare example in the U.S. of a shipping line offering regularly scheduled service for the primary purpose of transportation of passengers rather than of leisure or entertainment. Voyages can last many days, but, in contrast to the luxury of a typical cruise line, cabins cost extra, and most food is served cafeteria-style. History =Pre-statehood= The forerunner to the Alaska Marine Highway was the Chilkoot Motorship Lines, founded in 1948 by Haines residents Steve Homer and Ray Gelotte. The company used a converted LCT-Mark VI landing craft, christened the . They operated a weekly service from Tee Harbor (north of Juneau) to Haines and Skagway, connecting the territorial capital to the international road system. The Chilkoot Motorship Lines was purchased by the territorial government, and moved under the Territorial Board of Road Commissioners in 1951. In 1957, the MV Chillkoot was replaced by the MV Chilkat, which remained a part of the system until being decommissioned in 1988. =A state ferry system= In 1959, the year Alaska became a state, voters approved an $18 million ($ million today) bond package to improve the ferry system throughout the Southeast and Southcentral regions. The package included 4 new vessels and new docks throughout. The first of these new vessels built was the MV Malaspina, followed closely by the MV Matanuska and MV Taku. With 3 new ships, and a new name, the Alaska Marine Highway System (AMHS) was born. The following year, the ocean-certified MV Tustumena was completed, the Chilkat moved to Prince William Sound, and the AMHS started service in Southcentral. In 1969, that service was expanded with the addition of the MV E.L. Bartlett, in service with the state until 2004. AMHS vessels docked at Pier 48 in Seattle, 1975. =Farther south= In 1967, two events acted to severely restrict transportation to and from Southeast Alaska. A slide took out the Alaska Highway to the North, and BC Ferries MV Queen of Prince Rupert ran aground, severely limiting transfer passengers ability to move between the AMHS Southern terminus of Prince Rupert, British Columbia to Seattle. Until this time, portions of the passage between Southeast Alaska and Washington State were classified as outside waters, and none of the vessels the AMHS operated in Southeast Alaska had the necessary ocean-going certification required to carry passengers on outside waters. Citing the need for a transportation link between Alaska and the rest of the United States, then governor Wally Hickel ordered the AMHS to send a vessel south to Seattle while putting a request to Congress to re-classify the route as inside waters. The Federal government agreed to do so, which left the AMHS with a significantly longer route system, and no new vessels to serve it. Faced with the lengthy construction time and cost of building a new vessel, the AMHS looked abroad to find a quicker solution. The Stena Britannica, just a year old, was purchased and rechristened the MV Wickersham. While the Wickersham was relatively inexpensive to purchase, and could be added to the system quickly, she was never re-flagged as an American ship, and so commercial operation between US ports of call was a violation of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (commonly known as the Jones Act). Initially, the State of Alaska had felt they would be able to get a waiver of the Jones Act for the Wickersham, but that request was blocked, severely limiting the scheduling flexibility of the ship. While the Wickersham could pick up passengers in Washington State and deliver them to Alaska if there were an intermediary stop in Canada, moving passengers within Alaska was not allowed. Additionally, as the Wickersham was not specifically built for Alaskan ports, she was limited as to which ports she could dock at. The AMHS ordered the new construction of the MV Columbia, which replaced the Wickersham on the mainline Seattle route in 1974. The southern terminus of the AMHS remained in Seattle until October 1989, when it moved to the Bellingham Cruise Terminal in Fairhaven, Washington, after signing a 20-year lease with the city of Bellingham. =Feeder service= Facing the need to increase capacity, both the Matanuska and Malaspina were stretched by 56 feet, beyond the capacity of some of the smaller harbors and leaving the Taku as the only AMHS ship in Southeast able to serve some of the smaller communities. To serve the smaller communities of Southeast, the AMHS ordered the MV LeConte in 1974 and the MV Aurora in 1978. These would be the last new ships built for the AMHS for 20 years, ending the initial construction of the AMHS. =Exxon Valdez oil spill= On March 24, 1989, the Exxon Valdez struck Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound. The State of Alaska's on scene response was managed from the E.L. Bartlett, later relieved by the Aurora. Suction trucks were placed in the car-deck, temporarily converting the ferry into a spill response vessel. The State of Alaska determined a new vessel was necessary, and the new vessel should be designed from the beginning to be able to take on a command and control role in the case of another disaster. Funded in part by settlement money from Exxon, the MV Kennicott joined the system in 1998. =Day boats= New construction since the Kennicott has focused on day boats, which can run their expected schedule and return home within a 12-hour shift. In 2004, the MV Lituya was added to the fleet to make the trip between Ketchikan and Metlakatla in Southeast. With a design heavily influenced by oil rig supply vessels, she is unique among the fleet with an open car deck and limited passenger facilities. Costing only $9.5 million ($ million today), her low fuel consumption and small crew complement make her the most economical vessel in the fleet, giving the AMHS real-world data on the effectiveness of small, short-haul ferries in Southeast waters. = Labor strike = In 2019, a labor strike involving over 400 members of the Inlandboatman's Union of the Pacific shut down the AMH for several days between July 24 and August 2. This strike, the first one the AMH had seen in 42 years, lead to a $3.2 million loss in revenue and reimbursements and was resolved with Federal mediation. Routes Map showing the Alaska Marine Highway System =Southeast Alaska= The southeast AMHS route system is divided into two subsystems: the mainline routes which typically take more than one day for the ship to travel; and shorter routes where the vessels depart their home port in the morning, travel to destination ports and then return to their home port on the same day. The shorter routes are commonly referred to as \\"day boat\\" routes. The mainline routes carry a high percentage of tourists in the summer, and provide service between Bellingham, Washington or Prince Rupert, British Columbia and Skagway, Alaska. Along the way, the ships stop in Ketchikan, Wrangell, Petersburg, Sitka, Juneau, and Haines. The smaller communities Kake and Hoonah are served by certain mainline sailings. During 2008, the five largest AMHS vessels were used on the Southeast mainline routes. These were the , , , , and the . Day boat service was also provided on the North Lynn Canal route during the peak summer season by MV Malaspina. This route provides round-trip service between Juneau, Haines and Skagway. The day boat routes connect the smaller communities of Southeast Alaska with each other and with the Southeast Alaska mainline communities (Ketchikan, Petersburg, Wrangell, Sitka, Juneau, Haines and Skagway) that serve as regional centers for commerce, government health services, and/or connections to other transportation systems. The day boat routes primarily serve local residents, and include Angoon, Hoonah, Kake, Metlakatla, Pelican, and Tenakee. In 2008, three AMHS vessels provided service on the day boat routes. These were the , the and the . The MV Lituya is dedicated to providing day boat service between Ketchikan and Metlakatla. The Southeast System connects with the continental road system at Bellingham, Washington, Prince Rupert, British Columbia, and in Alaska at Haines and Skagway. =Cross-gulf service= When the MV Kennicott, a vessel certified to operate in open waters, joined the fleet in the summer 1998 the ferry system expanded to include regular cross-gulf sailings. Also known as \\"inter-tie trips\\", these sailings connect Southeastern Alaska with Southcentral and Southwest regions of the state. All cross-gulf trips include a stop at the port of Yakutat, a community unique in that it is served only on a cross-gulf route. During 2008, the AMHS provided Yakutat with 10 port calls. =Southwest Alaska= The Southwest system serves Prince William Sound, Kodiak Island, the Alaska Peninsula, and the Aleutian Islands. The MV Tustumena provides regular service between Kodiak, Port Lions, Seldovia and Homer. In 2008, between April and October, the MV Tustumena traveled out the Aleutian chain once a month to Unalaska/Dutch Harbor, stopping at Chignik, Sand Point, King Cove, False Pass, Akutan and Cold Bay. This trip is not made in the winter because of adverse weather conditions. In 2008 service in Prince William Sound to Valdez, Cordova and Whittier was provided by the MV Aurora. The MV Chenega provided additional service during the summer season, and the MV Kennicott provided supplemental service. AMHS also provided fifty-five stops in the village of Tatitlek and thirty-six stops in Chenega Bay. Tourist passengers add a significant percentage to the Prince William Sound traffic in the summer, especially between Valdez and Whittier. In the winter months when traffic demand was significantly reduced and weather conditions worsened, the MV Chenega was moved to North Lynn Canal to replace the Fairweather for its overhaul period. The MV Tustumena also underwent a CIP project, leaving the MV Aurora to provide service between the ports. Communities served The Alaska Marine Highway's main hub is in Juneau, though administrative offices are in Ketchikan. Other smaller operational hubs include Cordova (Prince William Sound), Ketchikan (southern Panhandle), and Kodiak (Southcentral Alaska). The AMHS serves the following communities year-round: Akutan; Angoon; Bellingham, Washington; Chenega Bay; Chignik; Cold Bay; Cordova; False Pass; Gustavus; Haines; Homer; Hoonah; Juneau; Kake; Ketchikan; King Cove; Kodiak; Metlakatla; Ouzinkie; Petersburg; Port Lions; Prince Rupert, British Columbia; Sand Point; Seldovia; Sitka; Skagway; Tatitlek; Tenakee Springs; Unalaska/Dutch Harbor; Valdez; Whittier; Wrangell; and Yakutat. Current vessels The following vessels, from smallest to largest, currently serve in the Alaska Marine Highway's fleet: * MV Tazlina, the newest Alaska-Class vessel and the first AMHS ship to be built in Alaska. * MV Lituya, solely dedicated to serving the Ketchikan-Metlakatla route * MV Aurora operates in Prince William Sound. * MV LeConte serves the feeder communities in northern Southeast as a day boat. * MV Chenega (fast ferry) has been laid up in Seattle, Washington, Lake Washington Ship Canal, due to service reductions. * MV Fairweather (fast ferry) operates a variety of routes in Southeast Alaska. * MV Tustumena, serves Southcentral and Aleutian Island communities. * MV Malaspina, runs backup mainline throughout Southeast Alaska when the MV Columbia is off-line for service. During the summer months it serves a daily shuttle route between Juneau, Haines and Skagway. * MV Matanuska, runs mainline throughout Southeast Alaska, frequently beginning in Prince Rupert, and occasionally running to Bellingham. * MV Kennicott, runs mainline throughout Southeast Alaska, frequently beginning in Prince Rupert and making a cross-Gulf of Alaska trip to Southcentral Alaska once a month. * MV Columbia, runs mainline throughout Southeast Alaska, usually beginning in Bellingham. Most Alaska Marine Highway System vessels are built for multiple-day voyages due to the large distances between ports. For example, it takes just under three days to travel from Bellingham to Skagway, and 18 hours for the Sitka to Juneau \\"milk run\\". Because of this, larger vessels (MV Tustumena and larger) come with staterooms, while all mainline vessels have solariums, showers, and lounges for sleeping. Hot food services and, on the MV Columbia, a sit-down restaurant are also offered. In July 2011 the Marine Highway began the bidding process to build the first of what they refer to as \\"Alaska-Class Vessels\\", made to travel shorter routes. They would not have staterooms available for passengers. One hundred-twenty million dollars have been set aside for the project and the ferries are scheduled to be delivered in 2018. These ships will be named the MV Tazlina and the MV Hubbard. All current vessels are named after Alaskan glaciers. Retired vessels In addition to the current fleet, the following vessels have been retired: * MV Bartlett * MV Chilkat * MV Chilkoot * MV Taku * MV Wickersham Traffic The AMHS carries around 350,000 passengers and 100,000 vehicles every year. In their 2008 Annual Traffic Volume Report, the Alaska Marine Highway reported moving 340,412 passengers and 109,839 vehicles; equating to the highest passenger ridership in eight years and the highest vehicle ridership in sixteen. The Ferry is very popular with summer tourists (one of the primary reasons Bellingham and Prince Rupert are AMHS destinations). Tent cities commonly sprout up on the aft of mainline vessels, and for budget-travellers, the AMHS is one of the top modes of transportation to the \\"Last Frontier\\". Service drops off significantly in winter. Vessels usually undergo overhauls and renovations during this period due to the decline in passenger and vehicle traffic (attributed to lack of tourists).

It is the largest grove of giant sequoias in the park, with several hundred mature examples of the tree. Two of its trees are among the 30 largest giant sequoias in the world. The grove closed on July 6, 2015, for a restoration project and reopened on June 15, 2018. The Mariposa Grove was first visited by non-natives in 1857 when Galen Clark and Milton Mann found it. They named the grove after Mariposa County, California, where the grove is located. The giant sequoia named Grizzly Giant is between probably 1900‚Äì2400 years old: the oldest tree in the grove. It has a volume of , and is counted as the 25th largest tree in the world. It is tall, and has a heavily buttressed base with a basal circumference of 28 m (92 ft) or a diameter of ; above the buttresses at 2.4 m above ground, the circumference is only 23 m. Grizzly Giant's first branch from the base is 2 m (6 ft) in diameter. Another tree, the Wawona Tree, had a tunnel cut through it in the nineteenth century that was wide enough for horse-drawn carriages and early automobiles to drive through. Weakened by the large opening at its base, the tree fell down in a storm in 1969. Abraham Lincoln signed an Act of Congress on June 30, 1864, ceding Mariposa Grove and Yosemite Valley to the state of California. Criticism of stewardship over the land led to the state's returning the grove to federal control with the establishment of Yosemite National Park. The Mariposa Grove Museum is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Noteworthy trees Some of the trees found in the grove that are worthy of special note are: * The Fallen Monarch: A giant sequoia that fell more than three hundred years ago. Giant sequoias are resistant to decay, so their remains can linger for a long period of time if undisturbed. * The Bachelor and Three Graces: A group of four giant sequoias, three of them growing very close together, with a fourth a little more distant. Their roots are so intertwined that if one of them were to fall, it would likely bring the others along with it. * The Grizzly Giant: The oldest tree and second largest tree in the grove, with a volume of . * The Washington tree: The largest tree in the grove, with a volume of . * The General Sheridan tree: A large, tall giant sequoia located south of the Mariposa Grove Cabin. * The General Grant tree: A large giant sequoia located west of the Mariposa Grove Cabin. Not to be confused with the General Grant Tree of Sequoia National Park. * The Columbia tree: The tallest tree in the grove and in Yosemite National Park at . * The California Tunnel Tree: Cut in 1895 to allow coaches to pass through it (and as a marketing scheme to attract visitors to the grove), this is the only living giant sequoia tree with a tunnel in it since the fall of the Wawona Tunnel Tree in 1969 and the fall of the Pioneer Cabin Tree in 2017. * The Faithful Couple: A rare case in which two trees grew so close together that their trunks have fused together at the base. * The Clothespin tree: Countless fires throughout the decades nearly severed this tree's trunk, creating a space in it large enough for a pick-up truck to drive through. * The Telescope tree: A giant sequoia tree that has become completely hollow from repeated fires through the decades. Despite that, the tree is still living, as giant sequoias do not require a whole trunk to survive. It is possible to walk inside the tree and, from there, see the sky. This condition leaves the tree weakened and makes it more difficult for it to withstand strong winds. This tree (and the Clothespin Tree) could topple at any time. * The Galen Clark tree: Of historical importance, as it is said to be the first tree seen by Galen Clark when he entered the grove, and inspired his love for the giant sequoias and struggle for setting aside the land for preservation, a new concept in the mid-19th century. * The Wawona Tunnel Tree: Renamed the \\"Fallen Tunnel Tree\\" after it toppled over during a snow storm in 1969. In 1881, this was the first tree to have a tunnel carved through its trunk. Its collapse is seen as a turning point in the preservation program in National Parks in the United States. So grave was the shock of the tree's collapse that the result was a greater awareness of the sensitivity of ecosystems, even for a living thing as massive as the giant sequoias. * The Fallen Giant: It was one of the largest trees in the grove, until it fell in 1873. * The Massachusetts tree: It was one of the most famous trees in the grove. It fell in 1927. Gallery Image:Fallen Monarch in November 2004.jpegFallen Monarch, a fallen giant sequoia that greets visitors at the parking lot.

Mariposa Grove Museum The Mariposa Grove Museum, also known as the Mariposa Grove Cabin, is a large cabin that was built in 1930. The cabin sits in the shadow of two prominent giant sequoia trees: General Grant and General Sheridan.

They are described as an aggressive cult obsessed with power, violence, and sexual domination. For this reason they are often described as \\"whores\\", especially by their enemies, the Bene Gesserit. The Honored Matres are first introduced in Herbert's Heretics of Dune (1984) and play a continued role in his final Dune novel, Chapterhouse: Dune (1985). They also appear in Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007), novels by Herbert's son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson that conclude the original series. The sequels are based on Frank Herbert's notes for his planned seventh novel in the series. Storylines After the death of the tyrant Leto II Atreides in God Emperor of Dune (1981), trillions of people of the Old Empire take to the stars in a diaspora known as the Scattering. Representatives from each major race and order of the Empire spread out beyond the known universe in fleets of no-ships, beginning the journey along Leto II's Golden Path to save mankind from destruction. = Introduction = The Honored Matres develop during this Scattering; in Heretics of Dune, they return to the Old Empire, wreaking havoc and leaving destruction in their wake. Tleilaxu Master Waff notes that they are \\"Far more terrible than Reverend Mothers of the Bene Gesserit.\\" It is ultimately indicated in Chapterhouse Dune that they are fleeing a powerful \\"unknown enemy\\" who had conquered their own massive empire out in the Scattering. Violent and without mercy, the Matres possess military and sexual skills that seem to indicate to some that they are an outgrowth from or a combination of the Fish Speakers and Bene Gesserit who fled out into the Scattering. They do not, however, possess Other Memory or use melange, though their skill as sexual imprinters has surpassed that of the Bene Gesserit. The Matres target the Bene Tleilax, and capture and torture as many Bene Gesserit Reverend Mothers as possible to glean their secrets. Similarly, the Bene Gesserit hope to decipher their new enemies' motives, and learn enough about the fearsome Matres to defeat them. The Honored Matres make many attacks on Bene Gesserit strongholds throughout the known bounds of the Old Empire. They mark the Bene Gesserit Bashar Miles Teg and the Duncan Idaho ghola for death, destroying the Gammu Keep in an unsuccessful attempt to kill Idaho, and annihilating the planet Rakis with their Obliterators, killing Teg. Eventually, the core of the Honored Matres is destroyed according to the plan of the Bene Gesserit leader, Mother Superior Darwi Odrade. At the Battle of Junction, the Honored Matre stronghold, both Odrade and Great Honored Matre Logno perish, giving Murbella, a former Honored Matre assimilated into the Bene Gesserit, the chance to ascend to both positions, carrying out the rest of Odrade's plan by unifying the orders. = Hunters of Dune = The first sequel to the original Dune series finds the Bene Gesserit unified with the Honored Matres into a New Sisterhood. Joining forces to prepare for their mutual Enemy, both factions struggle to coexist in this new form, under Murbella's rule. But renegade Matres still persist; led by Matre Superior Hellica, they still maintain strongholds on captured worlds such as Buzzell, Gammu, and Tleilax. Over the course of twenty years, Murbella leads the Sisterhood against the renegades, culminating in the Battle of Tleilax, where Hellica is killed and the planet is completely destroyed. Upon killing Hellica, Murbella discovers that she is in fact a Face Dancer. With the fall of Tleilax, and the revelation of Face Dancer infiltration, the unbalanced and vindictive breed of Honored Matres is crushed. Origins Murbella soon learns the \\"missing link\\" in the origin of the Matres by exploring their past through Other Memory; initially a hybrid group of Bene Gesserit and Fish Speakers, they had developed their violent tendencies with their third addition: awakened Tleilaxu females. The best kept secret of the Tleilaxu ‚Äî that their famed axlotl tanks are in fact their race's females kept in a vegetative state ‚Äî had been laid bare before the matriarchal alliance, and their wrath had known no bounds. Attacking every Tleilaxu planet on their way out of the galaxy, the martial prowess of both the Fish Speakers and the Bene Gesserit had ensured their victory. They had managed to liberate a number of the axlotl tanks, and their next task had been to rehabilitate the brain- dead women. The fledgling order had enjoyed a modicum of success, and eventually the Tleilaxu females, angry at their males for treating them in such a way, had vowed revenge. Thus, when the Honored Matres burst upon the universe again, they take special care to lay waste to every extant Tleilaxu world (though the Matres of later generations cannot remember the origin of their own hatred for the Tleilaxu). This anger leads to the name of the order, \\"Honored Matres\\", or Honored Mothers. The Enemy Murbella also discovers the true nature of the unknown Enemy: they are the resurrected thinking machines, thought destroyed 15,000 years before, at the end of the Butlerian Jihad but amassing a force to finally exterminate humanity. Through Other Memory she witnesses the Honored Matres' first encounter with the unknown Enemy. A young Matre commander had invaded an area controlled by the remnants of the machine empire, with initial success. However, the thinking machines' retribution had been terrible, especially when they had realized that humans still existed. The machines had destroyed the Honored Matre empire, and the remnants had then fled back to the Old Empire to build a new dominion.  Characteristics  The Honored Matres rule through sexual enslavement, sheer physical power, and the terror inspired by their draconian methods. They are completely without mercy and quick to anger, often resorting to extreme measures of violence in the face of the slightest provocations. The Bene Gesserit initially believe that these tendencies arise from the rage that comes from their inability to satisfy the increasingly jaded tastes that necessarily come from being able to exercise absolute sexual or sensual control over another person. However, Murbella, the combined Mother Commander of both the Honored Matres and Bene Gesserit, is able to access the Other Memories of the Honored Matres to find that these tendencies come from the Tleilaxu females' retribution towards males from the millennia of abuse they suffered as axlotl tanks. The leadership succession practices employed by the order are severe; a subordinate sister who manages to kill the leader, the so- called Great Honored Matre or Matre Superior, takes her place. The Honored Matres lack the control that the Bene Gesserit have over their internal chemistry, making them vulnerable to disease in ways the Bene Gesserit are not. Lacking Bene Gesserit Other Memory, the Honored Matres use an agony- inducing device known as a T-Probe in order to impress knowledge directly to their nervous system. =Sexual imprinting= The Honored Matres are characterized by their extremely violent tendencies and their ability to imprint a man sexually, amplifying his orgasmic response to such an ecstatic height that the victim of an imprinting becomes \\"addicted\\" to his imprinter, thereby becoming a willing slave of the Honored Matre who \\"marks\\" him. Both of these qualities are presumably evolutions of the unbridled sexual energies of the Siaynoq communion once enjoyed by the Fish Speakers with the God Emperor Leto II Atreides. The sexual imprinting practiced by the Honored Matres also hints at their roots in the original Bene Gesserit, who possessed similar, though significantly less potent, abilities.In Dune, Lady Jessica notes that the Bene Gesserit sometimes \\"prepare\\" a dangerous person by implanting a command word \\"into the deepest recesses by the old pleasure-pain methods\\". Margot Fenring presumably does so to Feyd-Rautha during her \\"hypno-ligation\\" of him. In Heretics of Dune, Bene Gesserit Imprinter Lucilla is tasked to imprint the Duncan Idaho ghola to secure his loyalty to the Sisterhood. =Alternative to melange= As the Bene Gesserit rely on melange and its many beneficial properties, the Honored Matres employ (and are similarly addicted to) a different drug that stimulates the production of adrenaline and other chemicals typically produced by the body when experiencing pain. In addition to heightening the senses and responses of a user, this stimulant causes the eyes of an addict to be covered in flecks of orange when agitated, and when an addict is completely enraged the eyes are consumed by the color orange. =Prana-bindu and the Hormu fighting style= The Honored Matres exercise a form of what the Bene Gesserit refer to as prana-bindu, but they execute movement at a speed that far outmatches that of their Bene Gesserit contemporaries. This is coupled with their fighting style, known as \\"Hormu\\", which is centered on the use of kicks to weak points on the body. The combination of these produces a warrior that is superhumanly fast and more than a match for any fully trained Reverend Mother in direct combat. =Linguistic skills= Honored Matres are capable of using combinations of language and tone in order to compel listeners into obedience on a subconscious level. Through manipulating the use of these skills, an Honored Matre is capable of prompting the unconscious mind on a level that may be difficult to resist. However, in Chapterhouse: Dune both Odrade and Murbella comment that these skills are nowhere near as potent as the Bene Gesserit Voice. Further, in Heretics of Dune, Odrade theorizes that the Honored Matres may have been driven back from the Scattering as their subjects have developed resistance to their form of Voice control due to its over use.  Notable Honored Matres  = Dama = In Chapterhouse Dune, the Great Honored Matre on Junction is Dama; she is referred to as \\"Spider Queen\\" by the Bene Gesserit leader Darwi Odrade. Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Lucilla flees the destruction of Lampadas by the Honored Matres, but is forced to land on Gammu. She is captured and brought before Dama, but not killed outright. A game of words begins, and Dama tries to persuade Lucilla to join the Honored Matres, preserving her life in exchange for Bene Gesserit secrets. Dama does not try to hide the fact that the Matres dearly want to learn to modify their biochemistry as the Bene Gesserit do. These word battles with Lucilla continue for weeks. When she reveals to Dama that, although the Bene Gesserit know how to manipulate and control the populace, they practice and believe in democracy, Dama's desire to destroy the Sisterhood is redoubled when she discovers the Bene Gesserit teach this dangerous knowledge. Dama kills Lucilla. Dama soon meets with Mother Superior Odrade; Dama at first seems surprisingly cooperative, but Odrade soon realizes that Dama intends no reasonable negotiation. Under cover of Odrade's diplomacy, the Bene Gesserit forces under Miles Teg attack Junction with tremendous force. Logno ‚Äî chief advisor to Dama ‚Äî assassinates Dama with poison and assumes control of the Honored Matres. = Hellica = In Hunters of Dune, Hellica has declared herself Matre Superior of the largest renegade Honored Matre force. Based on the conquered planet Tleilax in the formal capital Bandalong, Hellica forces captive Lost Tleilaxu Uxtal to produce increased quantities of the orange spice substitute using the secret of the Tleilaxu axlotl tanks. Uxtal is also producing gholas for the Face Dancer Khrone; Hellica befriends the sociopathic ghola of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. When Guild Navigator Edrik seeks Uxtal's knowledge in producing melange in the tanks, Hellica's price for his expertise is Edrik's help transporting a certain cargo. He agrees, delivering by heighliner the Obliterators that destroy the planet Richese, where the Bene Gesserit are mass-producing weapons and armed battleships. Later, Hellica attempts an Obliterator attack on Chapterhouse itself, but the plan fails. Murbella's forces conquer Tleilax, and Hellica is killed. However, it is revealed that she and some of her elite guard were actually Face Dancer duplicates; it is unknown when the original Hellica was disposed of and replaced. = Logno = In Chapterhouse Dune, Logno assassinates Great Honored Matre Dama with poison while the Bene Gesserit forces are attacking Junction. Logno, the former chief advisor to Dama, assumes control of the Honored Matres and immediately surrenders. Bene Gesserit leader Odrade is surprised, but she and Miles Teg soon realize they have fallen into a trap. The Honored Matres use \\"the Weapon\\" and turn defeat into victory. Murbella saves as much of the Bene Gesserit force as she can and they begin to withdraw to Chapterhouse. Odrade, however, had planned for the possible failure of the Bene Gesserit attack and left Murbella instructions for a last desperate gamble. Murbella pilots a small craft down to the surface, announcing herself as an Honored Matre who, in the confusion, has managed to escape the Bene Gesserit with all their secrets. She arrives on the planet and immediately announces her intentions by killing an overeager Honored Matre with a blinding speed enhanced by Bene Gesserit training that makes her faster than any Honored Matre before her. Murbella is taken to Logno, and immediately declares herself hostile. Logno cannot help herself and attacks, Murbella disposes of her and some allies. She takes charge of the Honored Matres, who are awed by her physical prowess. = Murbella = In Heretics of Dune, Chapterhouse: Dune, Hunters of Dune and Sandworms of Dune Murbella is Honored Matre with above average abilities when compared to other Matres. She eventually becomes the leader of the Honored Matres and the Bene Gesserit, calling it the New Sisterhood.

It is Swedish director Lukas Moodysson's second full-length film. Set in a Stockholm commune called \\"Tillsammans\\" (Swedish for \\"Together\\") in 1975, it is a satirical view of socialist values and a bittersweet comedy. Plot summary Together is set in one of the sharehome communes that was created around Stockholm in the 1970s. Loosely led by the kind-natured G√∂ran, who will do anything to avoid a conflict, the group spend their time arguing about left-wing politics and other more practical issues, such as whether doing the dishes is bourgeois. The sharehome's dynamics are significantly shaken when G√∂ran's sister, Elisabeth, leaves her violent husband Rolf and moves in, bringing her two children Eva and Stefan. Self- declared lesbian Anna lives in the commune with her ex-husband Lasse and their son Tet (named after the Tet offensive), who befriends Stefan. The two play games such as \\"torture the Pinochet victim\\" where, in the spirit of equality, they take turns at being Augusto Pinochet. Eva meanwhile befriends a lonely boy across the street named Fredrik; his family appears conventional on the surface but proves to be even more dysfunctional than the commune of which they so openly disapprove. The children are portrayed as sidelined by everyone in the film, from the new school where they are bullied to the parents who, while genuinely loving, are too busy experimenting with their own freedom to show it. Elisabeth's husband Rolf makes a concerted effort to clean up his act, although not before getting drunk and arrested, leaving his children stranded on a roadside after a disastrous meal in a Chinese restaurant. Further relationship problems are found with Klas, who is desperately in love with Lasse, and between G√∂ran and his selfish and immature girlfriend, who wants the benefits of an open relationship but not the responsibilities. Trivia The character \\"Birger\\" (Sten Ljunggren) had previously appeared in another film from the same director.

In addition to these fields, the Hopkins Center, or the \\"Hop\\" as it is called by students, has a woodshop and jewelry studio which are open for use by students and the public. Features A performance in the Spaulding Auditorium Within the Hopkins Center are Faulkner Recital Hall, Spaulding Auditorium, Warner Bentley Theater, the Moore Theater, and Alumni Hall. These are used for student performances, concerts and plays by visiting artists, and alumni and faculty meetings. Various student groups perform regularly at the Hop, including the Dartmouth College Gospel Choir, Dartmouth Dance Ensemble, the Glee Club, the Barbary Coast Jazz Ensemble, the Wind Symphony, and the Symphony Orchestra, among others. Students receive a reduced ticket price for performances. However, all events are open to the public. Tickets can be purchased at the Hop's box office. The center makes available several classes each term for the enrichment of students and the public. For example, the dance department usually offers classes in different styles of dance, from ballet to hip hop. The Hop is also home to the College's Hinman Mail Center. Each undergraduate student receives his or her own mailbox, known as a \\"Hinman Box\\" or \\"HB\\", at the beginning of freshman year. Packages may be sent to the mail center as well. Among the many artists and groups featured in the 2014 season were renowned musician Reggie Watts and virtuoso American violinist Joshua Bell.http://dartmouth.edu/events/event?event=24646#.UkPYecbryuQ = \\"Top of the Hop\\" = On special occasions, events are held at the \\"Top of the Hop\\", an area on the second floor of the center. The college's president often holds catered events here to celebrate various visitors, donors, exhibits, or performances. History When the Hopkins Center opened in 1962, it was the first academic (or civic) arts center of its kind, and as such, it served as the prototype for an entire generation of such centers that has grown to encompass many hundreds over the succeeding half century. Its genesis was the promise for a new theater made in the late 1920s by then Dartmouth president Ernest Martin Hopkins to Warner Bentley, a newly recruited English faculty member with responsibility for the non-department theatre program. Various calamities intervened‚Äîthe Depression, the Second World War, Korea, and Hopkins' own retirement. But when the building finally reached the construction stage in the favorable economic climate of the early 1960s, its concept had grown to include space for a new concert hall / film theater, a \\"black box\\" theater, music and theatre rehearsal halls, a recital hall, gallery exhibition and art storage space, arts studios, and a student workshop ‚Äî and its new footprint covered four and a half acres. An early architect's rendering revealed a building of Georgian-style brick, matching much of the rest of the Dartmouth campus. But with the engagement of architect Wallace K. Harrison, a favorite of Dartmouth graduate and New York's then-governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, the style moved to 1960s modern, and the arched and glassed-in front fa√ßade took on aspects that Harrison drew upon when he later designed the new Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center. The arts were not new to Dartmouth at the time. A student theatre company, the Glee Club, Handel Society Chorus, Community Symphony Orchestra, Dartmouth Film Society, and artist-in-residence programs all pre-existed‚Äîbut the thought was that students would need to be drawn into the arts activity housed within the center. So, integral to its concept was the use of internal glass. Large windows looked into the theaters and design shops, practice rooms, art studios, and galleries ‚Äî many of which proved impractical given the activity occurring within. Public programs initiated by its first director, Warner Bentley, and his successor, Peter D. Smith, drew significant media coverage and made the Hopkins Center a regional and sometimes national destination. For a number of years in the mid- and late 1960s, the Hop hosted a summer Congregation of the Arts, which featured summer theatre programs, a festival orchestra and resident chamber ensembles that performed works by distinguished contemporary composers invited to residencies, exhibitions of works by artists-in-residents, and special film series. The Hop earned a reputation as a venue friendly to contemporary music that persisted for nearly two decades. In the 1970s it also initiated and hosted Celebration Northeast, an indoor / outdoor festival that was one of the first to celebrate indigenous but non‚Äìmainstream North America folk musics. For many years the Hop remained ahead of the curve in its programming of imported events, and Peter Smith liked to joke that he was the only impresario who could fail to sell out a 900-seat hall for either Luciano Pavarotti or Bruce Springsteen ‚Äî both of whom were engaged just prior to their super- stardom.  Connections  The Hopkins Center is connected to the Hood Museum of Art, North America's oldest museum in continuous operation. This is Dartmouth's own museum, which houses both permanent collections and visiting exhibitions. After a walk through the museum, one can visit the Hood's museum store which is located next to the Courtyard Caf√©. Beneath the museum is the Hood Auditorium which regularly has movie showings.

A second 44th Infantry Division existed in the Illinois Army National Guard from 1946 until October 1954, when that division was disbanded after federal service during the Korean War.  Formation Originally named the 44th Division, it was constituted on 19 October 1920 as a National Guard Division, as a result of the National Defense Act of 1920‚Äôs major expansion of the National Guard.Doubler, Michael D. \\"Civilian in Peace, Soldier in War: The Army National Guard, 1636‚Äì2000\\" (University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KA, 2003), p. 190.Wilson, John B., The Army Lineage Series: \\"Armies, Corps, Divisions and Separate Brigades\\" (US Army Center of Military History Washington, D.C, 1999) As originally conceived, the division was to consist of National Guard units from the States of Delaware, New Jersey and New York, and was to form part of the Second Corps Area. However, only individual members of the division staff, and not any whole units, ended up being assigned to the state of Delaware. The 57th Infantry Brigade from the New Jersey Army National Guard (NJARNG) and the 87th Infantry Brigade of the New York Army National Guard (NYARNG) were incorporated almost immediately and growth continued piecemeal, as subordinate units were organized, until 1940.‚ÄúHistorical and Pictorial Review, National Guard of the State of New Jersey‚Äù (Baton Rouge, 1940) The shoulder sleeve insignia (unit patch) of the 44th Division was approved by the Secretary of War on 5 October 1921.Memorandum for the Adjutant General of the Army from the Assistant Chief of Staff, dated 5 OCT 21, Subject: ‚ÄúShoulder Sleeve Insignia for the 44th Division,‚Äù US Army Institute of Heraldry files, re: 44th Infantry Division, Fort Belvoir, VA.

A regimental combat team, based on the 113th Infantry, was immediately detached from the division and attached to the Eastern Defense Command to provide ground forces for the defense of the East Coast from New York to Philadelphia. Shortly afterwards, the remainder of the division moved to Camp Claiborne, LA, where the 44th Division was reorganized and redesignated, the 44th Infantry Division on 16 February 1942. The division was then sent to Fort Lewis Washington, where it participated in defense of the West Coast under the Western Defense Command for the remainder of 1942. In February 1943, the 44th Infantry Division, much reduced through the loss of personnel and units entered a period of rebuilding and training. After completing the \\"D-Series\\", division-level training, the 44th was sent to participate in the multi- division Fourth Army #6 Louisiana Maneuvers, 7 February-3 April 1944.

Within 6 days, the division was hit by a heavy German counterattack, 25‚Äì26 October. The attack was repulsed and the 44th continued its active defense. On 13 November 1944, it jumped off in an attack northeast, forcing a passage through the Vosges Mountains east of Leintrey to Dossenheim, took Avricourt, 17 November, and pushed on to liberate Strasbourg, along with the 2d French Armored Division. After regrouping, the division returned to the attack, taking Ratzwiller and entering the Ensemble de Bitche in the Maginot Line. On 14 December, regiments of the 44th Division took part in assaulting major Maginot line fortifications. The division's 71st and 324th Infantry Regiments assaulted Fort Simserhof and nearby Hottviller. After six days of fighting, Simershof was captured on 20 December. Displacing to defensive positions east of Sarreguemines, 21‚Äì23 December, the 44th threw back three attempted crossings by the enemy of the Blies River. Mickey Rooney entertains soldiers of the 44th Division in Kist, Germany during a May 1945 jeep tour. An aggressive defense of the Sarreguemines area was continued throughout February 1945 and most of March. Moving across the Rhine at Worms, 26 March, in the wake of the 3d Division, the 44th relieved the 3d, 26‚Äì27 March, and crossed the Neckar River to attack and capture Mannheim, 28‚Äì29 March. Shifting to the west bank of the Main, the division crossed that river at Gross-Auheim in early April, and engaged in a 3-week training period. Attacking 18 April, after the 10th Armored Division, the 44th took Ehingen, 23 April, crossed the Danube, and attacking southeast, took F√ºssen, Berg, and Wertach, in a drive on Imst, Austria. On 2 May, a group of V-2 rocket scientists that included Wernher von Braun surrendered to the 44th. Capture of Werner von Braun by the 324th Regiment Anti-tank Company Pursuing the disintegrating enemy through Fern Pass and into the Inn River valley, the 44th set up its CP at Imst on 4 May.

Activities The members of Schwarze Kapelle were patriotic Germans, including many in the higher echelons of the Wehrmacht and Abwehr, who feared Hitler's policies would ruin the country. By overthrowing the Nazi Party they hoped to preserve German sovereignty. Through Admiral Canaris' Abwehr they were in touch with their counterparts in Britain, in other Allied nations, and in various neutral nations. Elements of the Schwarze Kapelle began making overtures to Britain before war broke out and while Hitler could have been easily ousted or killed. British officials said they would not interfere with German internal affairs at that time. Many hard feelings remained from the First World War, exacerbated by Hitler's treacherous invasion of \\"Rump\\" Czechoslovakia six months after the Munich Agreement, which made the British feel they'd been taken for fools. Moreover, Britain had been burned in the Venlo Incident, losing two SIS officers‚Äîincluding Sigismund Payne Best, who had extensive knowledge of British espionage on the continent‚Äîto supposed \\"discontented conservatives\\" who were actually Sicherheitsdienst counterintelligence operatives. The conspirators were not necessarily seeking to reintegrate Germany into the family of peaceful and democratic nations. If anything, they sought to consolidate the gains Germany had already made under Hitler. Admiral Canaris, for example, had a very aggressive war record from the previous war.Brown, p.134 Thus, although Hitler had built Germany into the world's most dominant power, the conspirators were afraid his hubris would eventually destroy that dominance. Allied officials recognized, more than the conspirators themselves, that the conspirators' goals were not necessarily those of the Allies. They were also reluctant to accept the credibility of the organisation, believing it to be a front for the Gestapo. During the Venlo Incident in late 1939, two British agents were kidnapped yards inside Dutch territory and spirited across into Germany, where they remained in captivity until the last week of the war. The agents had gone there to meet what they thought were German military plotters against Hitler, but the Germans were actually members of the Gestapo. Thus the Allies encouraged the Schwarze Kapelle to act but were not willing to promise anything in return. This reticence was to hamper the German opposition throughout the entire war. By September 1938 the Schwarze Kapelle had drawn up plans for a provisional government, based on the British Constitutional Monarchy. A coup was all ready to take place, when the Munich Agreement failed, as they thought it would. The plotters thought Britain would deny Hitler the Sudetenland, and they were certain that Hitler was not just rattling his saber, that he would then give the order to invade the Sudetenland. The order for the coup depended on Hitler's order to invade. The conspirators were convinced such an invasion would result in a war that Germany was sure to lose, and they were bound and determined to avoid such a war.Shirer, page 375 It was one moment in history in which the military of an aggressive country was specifically against starting a war. When Chamberlain caved in, the invasion was unnecessary, and the coup was aborted. During the coup Captain Friedrich Heinz was to have arranged for Hitler to be shot \\"resisting arrest.\\" This was not to be the last time Heinz had such an assignment. With the Munich Agreement Hitler rose to his highest esteem yet; under those circumstances, no coup could possibly hope to win the support of the German people, or even the military. Chief of Staff Franz Halder called off all coup plans. The plans for a provisional government were brought out of mothballs a year later, in October‚ÄìNovember 1939, when Hitler planned a November 12 autumn attack through the neutral low countries into France. Many on the General Staff thought it would be a military disaster at that time of year. At least as many high-ranking officers were also outraged at the barbarities being reported out of Poland, fearing what it would do to German prestige. The two motivations pushed events to within hours of launching the coup, which included a very detailed plan to quell any opposition from the Gestapo or SS. Captain Heinz was again tasked with capturing and shooting Hitler for attempting to \\"resist arrest.\\" It all revolved around the Wehrmacht‚Äîif Halder, again the man needed to give the go-ahead, would set things in motion. After a meeting between Commander-in-Chief Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch and Hitler‚Äîon the very day, at the very hour, of the planned coup, 1:30 p.m. on November 5, 1939‚ÄîHalder utterly panicked after hearing von Brauchitch's account of the meeting, in which Hitler spoke of the \\"spirit of Zossen,\\" meaning OKH headquarters. Halder (wrongly, it turned out) took it to mean Hitler had found them all out and thought the worst. He ordered everything shut down and all documents burned. There was enough support from high-level military commanders during both the 1938 and the 1939 plots that the chief conspirator, Abwehr head Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, was able to offer the British the end the war, if either coup had succeeded. Ending or preventing war was, in fact, the reason for both coups. Unfortunately, the British were never really on board; the plotters never had enough confidence that Germany would be treated fairly, as opposed to 1919 and Versailles. This, plus the Stab-in-the-back legend, made it difficult for the Wehrmacht conspirators in particular (and they were central to any coup attempt) to be convinced they would not be seen as traitors. It was absolutely necessary that they pick a moment when Hitler was not popular, rather than viewed as a genius. In their minds, a coup in Germany could only take place against Hitler when they could claim successfully that he was taking Germany down a disastrous path. With Chamberlain's capitulation at Munich, and after the Hitler's delays on attacking in the West, the opposition's momentum never quite came in 1938 or 1939. An attack in the spring of 1940 (six months after the original planned attack) was actually seen as the correct military move. The season was right, plus the military had been given all that time to prepare further. Many generals who had earlier seen disaster on the horizon then saw victory ahead and climbed on board with Hitler. In both September 1938 and November 1938, events evolved to make Hitler look like a genius; the plotters did not feel they could capture or kill a popular Hitler, and events conspired against them. Hitler's winning streak did not begin to falter until September 1941 with the stalled Operation Barbarossa. By then, supporters of the earlier plots had almost all given up. Few remained actively opposed to Hitler, but enough remained to seed the Stauffenberg attempt in 1944. When Roosevelt announced at the Casablanca Conference, in January 1943, that the Allies would accept nothing less than unconditional surrender, Churchill and others realized this would force the Germans to fight \\"like rats.\\"Brown, p.239 Canaris also realized this demand would probably doom his efforts to recruit supporters among the German generals. The Schwarze Kapelle was prepared to move against Hitler during the Munich crisis, but Chamberlain's acquiescence made it impossible for them to recruit the Army generals whose support they needed. According to Bodyguard of Lies, on March 13, 1943, Colonel Henning von Tresckow had his adjutant, Fabian von Schlabrendorff, place a time bomb aboard Hitler's plane on March 13, 1943, right after Stalingrad, but it failed to go off, despite their testing and retesting the fuses.Brown, p.268 The July plot and aftermath After the July 20 Plot failed, the Gestapo rounded up the members of the Schwarze Kapelle and many, many more people, and put some 5,000 people to death (the Gestapo's records showed more than 7,000).Shirer, page 1072 Stauffenberg and three others were summarily shot that night.

It was activated in 1920 as a National Guard Division in Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island, and Vermont. The 143rd Regional Support Group of the Connecticut National Guard now carries on the heritage. Creation The 43rd Infantry Division was constituted on 19 October 1920, with the division headquarters being organized and federally recognized in Hartford, Connecticut, on 21 March 1925. The 43rd Division consisted of two infantry brigades, the 85th in Connecticut, and the 86th in Vermont. The 85th Brigade included the 102nd and 169th Infantry Regiment, both based in Connecticut. The 86th Brigade was made up of the 172nd Infantry Regiment in Vermont and the 103rd Infantry in Maine. In addition, the 68th Field Artillery Brigade was based in Providence, Rhode Island. Square Division example: 1940 US Infantry Division. On the far left can be seen two Brigades of two Regiments each World War II The 43rd Division was mobilized for federal service on 24 February 1941. It was reorganized as a \\"triangular\\" division meaning that it had three infantry regiments, rather than four infantry regiments organized into two brigades. The 43rd was originally sent to Camp Blanding, Florida where it was based prior to participating in the Louisiana Maneuvers of 1941 and the Carolina Maneuvers later than same year. The division relocated to Camp Shelby, Mississippi on 14 February 1942 and was officially re-designated as the 43rd Infantry Division on 19 February 1942. The division staged for shipment overseas at Fort Ord, California on 6 September 1942 and departed San Francisco on 1 October. The division arrived in New Zealand on 23 October 1942, prior to being committed to combat in the South West Pacific Theater under the command of General Douglas MacArthur. *Ordered into federal service: 24 February 1941. *Overseas: 1 October 1942. *Campaigns: New Guinea, Northern Solomons, Luzon. *Presidential Unit Citations: 4 Infantry Battalions (Luzon). *Personal Awards: MH-2 ; DSC-40 ; DSM-2 ; SS-736 ; LM-53; SM-51 ; BSM-2,496 ; AM-27. *Commanders: Maj.

The division moved to Noumea, New Caledonia, in November and to Guadalcanal, 17 February 1943. The Russell Islands were occupied without opposition, 21 February, and training continued. Elements landed on Vangunu and Rendova Islands against minor resistance, 30 June. Rendova served as the major staging point for the assault on the island of New Georgia. The assault on New Georgia was met with determined enemy resistance. The Japanese fought fiercely before relinquishing Munda and its airfield, 5 August. Vela Cela and Baanga were taken easily, but the Japanese resisted stubbornly on Arundel Island before withdrawing, 22 September. After training at Munda, the 43rd moved to Guadalcanal and thence to New Zealand for rest and rehabilitation. On 19 July 1944, the division was deployed to the Aitape-Wewak campaign, assuming defensive positions at Aitape. It engaged in patrols and reconnaissance at Tadji and along the Drinumor River, 25 July, and took the offensive, 8 August 1944, ending organized resistance on the 25th. On 9 January 1945, the 43rd made an assault landing in the San Fabian area, Lingayen Gulf, Luzon. Under enemy fire, the Division secured the beachhead and fought into the Lingayen Plain by 12 February. The offensive was resumed against the enemy north and west of Fort Stotsenburg, 27 February. After ending Japanese resistance in the Zambales Mountains with help from the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary, the 43rd swung south against the Shimbu Line. On 6 May 1945, the attack continued in the Bulacan area. Ipo Dam was secured and enemy opposition smashed in the Ipo area, 19 May. Mopping-up activities continued until 30 June 1945. The Division left Manila, 7 September 1945, and arrived in Yokohama, Japan on 13 September for occupation duty. The division began preparations for departure for home on 27 September 1945, and officially began their departure on 29 September. The first ship arrived in San Francisco on 8 October 1945, three years and seven days after the first ship had left on 1 October 1942. The division troops were then moved to Camp Stoneman near Pittsburg, California, and arrangements were made to send each man to the Army separation center nearest his home. =Casualties= *Total battle casualties: 6,026Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Killed in action: 1,128 *Wounded in action: 4,887 *Missing in action: 9 *Prisoner of war: 2 Post World War II (1946-1963) In 1946 the Division was reorganized again, and was now made up of units from Connecticut, Vermont and Rhode Island. The 172nd Infantry with the 206th Field Artillery Battalion were based in Vermont. The division headquarters, 102nd and 169th Infantry Regiments, and 963rd Field Artillery and 192nd Field Artillery were organized in Connecticut. In addition, Connecticut was also home to the 143rd Tank Battalion. Rhode Island was home to the 43rd Division Artillery Headquarters, the 103rd Field Artillery Battalion, the 118th Engineer Battalion and the 43rd Signal Company. Combat Support units were based throughout all three states. During the Korean War, the 43rd Division was again ordered into active Federal Service on 5 September 1950, and was moved to Seventh United States Army, VII Corps in West Germany in 1951. On 15 June 1954, the 43rd Infantry Division was released and returned to state control. Its elements, stationed in the Augsburg/Munich area, were redesignated 5th Infantry Division. The 43rd Infantry Division was inactivated on 1 May 1963 as a result of National Guard restructuring. Its headquarters was reorganized as Headquarters Company, 43rd Brigade, 26th Infantry Division aka the YANKEE Division. The 43rd Brigade was relieved from assignment to the 26th Division on 1 September 1993, when the 26th Division was inactivated. It was then reorganized as Headquarters Company, 43rd Infantry Brigade and now organized as the Headquarters Company, 143rd Regional Support Group. Commanding officers *Morris B.

Though nicknamed \\"Gentleman Jim\\", he was known for fearlessly pitching on the inside of the plate throughout his fifteen-year career. Born in Santa Maria, California, he attended San Luis Obispo High School and graduated from Stanford University. On August 14, 1963, he was signed as an amateur free agent by the Boston Red Sox. Lonborg enjoyed his best year in the Carl Yastrzemski-led Red Sox's \\"Impossible Dream\\" season, when he led American League (AL) pitchers in wins (22), games started (39), and strikeouts (246). That year, the Red Sox were involved in a four-way race for the AL pennant with the Detroit Tigers, Minnesota Twins, and Chicago White Sox; the race was reduced to three teams after the White Sox lost a doubleheader to the Kansas City Athletics, on September 27. The Red Sox and Twins faced each other in the season's final series and entered the final day (October 1) tied for first place; the Tigers were half a game out of first and needed to sweep a doubleheader from the California Angels to force a playoff between the winner of the Red Sox‚ÄìTwins game. Lonborg outdueled Twins ace Dean Chance in that finale, while the Tigers defeated the Angels in the first game but lost the second, putting the Red Sox in the World Series for the first time since . In that World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, Lonborg pitched game two, tossing what was only the fourth one-hitter in Series history and followed that up with another victory in game five by limiting the Cards to three hits. Called upon to pitch the seventh and deciding game with only 2 days' rest, he lasted 6 innings, but allowed 6 earned runs in a 7‚Äì2 loss. Teammate Dan Osinski remembered, \\"Lonborg couldn't break a pane of glass in the bullpen when he was warming up. We all knew that, and [Dick Williams] still started him. You know he could have pitched the bullpen an inning apiece, or something. It just gave Gibson too big a lead against us that we couldn't come back from.\\" Shortly after being fired by the Red Sox, pitching coach Sal Maglie also criticized Williams's handling of Lonborg. \\"It was obvious Lonborg didn't have it. Williams should have gotten him out sooner, and I told him so. It was a crime that he let a man who'd done such a great job for him all season take a pounding like that. It was degrading.\\" Lonborg received the Cy Young Award (becoming the first Red Sox pitcher so honored), played in the All-Star Game, and finished prominently in voting for the MLB Most Valuable Player (MVP) award (placing 6th in the voting, with teammate Yastrzemski winning the award). Lonborg in 1971 In December 1967, Lonborg tore the ligaments in his left knee while skiingJim Lonborg hurt skiing and his pitching career thereafter was marked by many injuries. He won only 27 games from through 1971, and was traded along with George Scott, Ken Brett, Billy Conigliaro, Joe Lahoud and Don Pavletich to the Milwaukee Brewers in a ten- player trade that also sent Tommy Harper, Marty Pattin, Lew Krausse and minor- league outfielder Pat Skrable to the Red Sox on October 10, 1971.\\"Red Sox, Brewers in 10‚ÄêPlayer Deal,\\" United Press International (UPI), Sunday, October 10, 1971. Retrieved April 13, 2020 With the Philadelphia Phillies needing to improve its pitching staff beyond Steve Carlton, both Lonborg and Brett were acquired along with Ken Sanders and Earl Stephenson from the Brewers for Don Money, John Vukovich and Bill Champion on October 31, 1972.\\"Phillies Obtain Jim Lonborg In 7‚ÄêMan Deal With Brewers,\\" United Press International (UPI), Tuesday, October 31, 1972.

After retiring, Lonborg attended the Tufts University School of Dental Medicine, and graduated in 1983. He worked as a general dentist in Hanover, Massachusetts until he retired in 2017. He is active in many nonprofit organizations, including Catholic Charities, Little League Baseball, and The Jimmy Fund. Lonborg lives in Scituate, Massachusetts. Lonborg was selected to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame, in 2002. On the Boston-based sitcom Cheers, the photo of Sam Malone pitching is actually that of Lonborg.

After the collapse of the Nazi regime, Degrelle went into exile in Francoist Spain where he remained a prominent figure in neo-Nazi politics. He died 50 years after being sentenced to death and losing his Belgian nationality for collaboration in 1944. Before the war After studying at a Jesuit college and attempting to get a degree in law and political sciences from the Catholic University of Leuven, but never graduating, Degrelle worked as a journalist for the conservative Roman Catholic periodical Christus Rex. During his time at this publication, he became attracted to the ideas of Charles Maurras and French Integralism. Until 1934, Degrelle worked as a correspondent for the paper in Mexico, during the Cristero War. He led a radical group inside the Catholic Party, based on the √âditions de Rex publishing house. The √âditions drew its name from the battle cry of the Cristeros: Viva Cristo Rey y Santa Mar√≠a de Guadalupe, alluding to Christ the King. Degrelle's actions inside the Catholic Party saw him come into opposition with the mainstream of the same party, many of whom were monarchist conservatives or centrists. The Rexist group, including the likes of Jean Denis, separated itself from the Catholic Party in 1935, after a meeting in Kortrijk. The newly formed party was heavily influenced by Fascism and Corporatism (but also included several elements interested solely in Nationalism or Ultramontanism); it had a vision of social equality that drew comparisons with Marxism but was staunchly anti-communist (anti-bolshevik). The party also came to denounce political corruption in Belgian politics. In 1936, in which Rex reached peak votes, it drew its support from Brussels (18.50%), Wallonia (15.16%), Flanders (7.01%), and Eupen-Malmedy (26.44%).Jean Ladri√®re, Fran√ßois Perin & Jean Meynaud. La d√©cision politique en Belgique, CRISP, Bruxelles, 1965, pp. Annexe III, pp. 85-86. Rexism had a Flemish ideological competitor in the Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond which advocated an independent Flanders and exclusive use of the Dutch language.Kinderen van de collaboratie Ervaringen en getuigenissen van nakomelingen van collaborateurs in de Tweede Wereldoorlog, Ugent 2010 Master thesis history in Dutch Flag of Rex In 1936, Degrelle met Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, both of them providing Rexism with funds (2 million lire and 100,000 marks) and ideological support. Elections in that year had given the Parti Rexiste 21 deputies and 12 senators, although its influence declined by 1939 when it managed to win only four seats in each Chamber. The party progressively added Nazi-inspired Antisemitism to its agenda, and soon established contacts with fascist movements around Europe. Degrelle notably met with Falange leader Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera and the Iron Guard's Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. During this time (mid-1930s), Degrelle became acquainted with the cartoonist Herg√©. In a volume published after his death (Tintin mon copain), the Rexist leader claimed that his years of journalism had inspired the creation of The Adventures of Tintin‚Äîignoring Herg√©'s statements that the character was in fact based on his brother, Paul Remi. Degrelle had been shipping Mexican newspapers containing American cartoons to Belgium, and Herg√© did admit years later in 1975 that Degrelle deserved credit for introducing him to the comic \\"strip\\".; (first published 2007 by John Murray Publishers Ltd.) Collaboration Propaganda from Waffen-SS. SS-Division blindee \\"Wallonie\\" leader Leon Degrelle L√©on Degrelle (center-left) awarding medals to members of the Walloon SS, April 1944 When the war began, Degrelle approved of King Leopold III's policy of neutrality. After the Germans invaded Belgium on 10 May 1940, the Rexist Party split over the matter of resistance. He was arrested as a suspected collaborator and evacuated to France. Unlike other Belgian deportees, Degrelle was spared in the and instead sent into a French concentration camp. He was later released when the occupation began. Degrelle returned to Belgium and proclaimed reconstructed Rexism to be in close union with Nazism‚Äîin marked contrast with the small group of former Rexists (such as Th√©o Simon and Lucien Mayer) who had begun fighting against the Nazi occupiers from the underground. In August, Degrelle started contributing to a Nazi news source, Le Pays R√©el (a reference to Charles Maurras). Degrelle joined the Walloon legion of the Wehrmacht, which was raised in August 1941, to fight against the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front. The leadership of the Rexists then passed to Victor Matthys. Lacking any previous military service, Degrelle joined as a private and was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class in March 1942. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a lieutenant in May 1942, and received the Iron Cross First Class the same month. Initially, the group was meant to represent a continuation of the Belgian Army, and fought as such during Operation Barbarossa, while integrating many Walloons who had volunteered for service. The Walloons were transferred from the Wehrmacht to the Waffen-SS in June 1943, becoming the Sturmbrigade Wallonien and served on the Eastern Front. From 1940, the Belgian Roman Catholic hierarchy had banned all uniforms during Mass. On 25 July 1943, in his native Bouillon, Degrelle was told by Dean Rev Poncelet to leave a Requiem Mass, because he was wearing his SS uniform, which church authorities had prohibited. Degrelle was excommunicated by the Bishop of Namur, but the excommunication was later lifted by the Germans since as a German officer he was under the jurisdiction of the German chaplaincy. 28th SS \\"Wallonien\\" Division made up of French-speaking Belgians. After being wounded at Cherkasy in 1943, Degrelle continued to climb the SS hierarchy after the inclusion of Walloons in the Waffen-SS. During the battle of the Korsun-Cherkassy Pocket, fought from 24 January to 16 February 1944, the Wallonien was given the task of defending against Soviet attacks on the eastern side of the pocket. While General Wilhelm Stemmermann, the overall commander for the trapped forces, moved them to the west of the pocket in readiness for a breakout attempt, Wallonien and Wiking were ordered to act as a rearguard. After Lippert was killed, Degrelle took command of the Brigade, and the Wallonien began its withdrawal under heavy fire. Of the brigade's 2,000 men, only 632 survived. For his actions at Korsun, Degrelle was promoted to SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer (major). He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (Ritterkreuz) by Hitler in February 1944. Degrelle later claimed Hitler told him, \\"You are truly unique in history. You are a political leader who fights like a soldier. If I had a son, I would want him to be like you.\\" Six months later Degrelle was awarded the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, as were seven other non-Germans. The unit was sent back to Wildflecken to be reformed. In June 1944, a 440-man battalion of the Wallonien was sent to Estonia to assist in the defence of the Tannenberg Line. After Operation Bagration began, Army Group North began to fall back into the Kurland Pocket. The battalion left through the port of Tallinn (Reval) on the Baltic Sea. The remnants of the Battalion were sent back to join the rest of the brigade, which was located at Breslau. On 8 July 1944 Degrelle's brother √âdouard, a pharmacist, was killed in Degrelle's hometown of Bouillon by Belgian resistance fighters. Shortly afterwards, a Rexist hit squad executed pharmacist Henri Charles. A few days later, three civilian hostages were executed, apparently on Degrelle's orders, as all three were known to be his political enemies. He commanded Sturmbrigade Wallonien from 18 September 1944 to 8 May 1945. He led the unit in the defense of Estonia against the Soviets. He was promoted to SS- Obersturmbannf√ºhrer (lieutenant colonel) in the early months of 1945. Degrelle was promoted to SS-Standartenf√ºhrer (colonel) on 20 April 1945. On 1 May 1945, Degrelle was promoted by SS Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler to Brigadef√ºhrer (brigadier general). This promotion, however, was extralegal due to Himmler having been removed from office on Hitler's orders on 28 April. Degrelle was wounded in action several times during the war and received the Wound Badge 1st Class and the Gold Close Combat Clasp, although none of his injuries were serious enough to require hospitalization.

The book is based on the author's fourteen months' service in the United States Navy, aboard the frigate USS Neversink (actually ). Overview Based on Melville's experiences as a common seaman aboard the frigate from 1843 to 1844 and stories that other sailors told him, the novel is severely critical of virtually every aspect of American naval life and thus qualifies as Melville's most politically strident work. At the time, though, the one thing that journalists and politicians focused on in the novel was its graphic descriptions of flogging and the horrors caused by its arbitrary use; in fact, because Harper & Bros. made sure the book got into the hands of every member of Congress, White-Jacket was instrumental in abolishing flogging in the U.S. Navy forever. Melville scholars also acknowledge the huge number of parallels between White-Jacket and Billy Budd and view the former as a rich source for possible interpretations of the latter.Hayford, Harrison and Sealts, Jr., Merton, eds. Billy Budd, Sailor (An Inside Narrative), \\"Editors' Introduction\\", p. 31. . The novel takes its title from the outer garment that the eponymous main character fashions for himself on board ship, with materials at hand, being in need of a coat sufficient for the rounding of Cape Horn. Due to a ship-wide rationing of tar, however, White-Jacket is forever denied his wish to tar the exterior of his coat and thus waterproof it. This causes him to have two near-death experiences, once when he is reclining among the canvases in the main-top and, his jacket blending in with the surrounding material, he is nearly unfurled along with the main sail; and once when, having been pitched overboard while reeving the halyards, he has to cut himself free from the coat in order not to drown. He having done so, his shipmates mistake the discarded jacket for a great white shark and harpoon it, sending it to a watery grave. The symbolism of the color white, introduced in this novel in the form of the narrator's jacket, is more fully expanded upon in Moby-Dick, where it becomes an all-encompassing \\"blankness\\".Melville, Herman and Bryant, ed. Tales, Poems, and Other Writings, p. xxv. . The mixture of journalism, history, and fiction; the presentation of a sequence of striking characters; the metaphor of a sailing ship as the world in miniature‚Äîall of these prefigure his next novel, Moby-Dick. White-Jacket and the Log of the USS United States Many of the actual crew and the incidents of the voyage recorded in the ship log are transformed and figure prominently in White-Jacket. As one Melville scholar has stressed, \\"Melville rarely invents...\\" and \\"the ship's records bear him out.\\"Anderson, Charles Robert, Melville in the South Seas (Dover Publications: New York,1966)p.364. Foremost among them is Melville's hero Jack Chase, captain of the maintop, in reality Englishman John J. Chase, age 53. Who Melville introduces in White-Jacket, Chapter 4, Jack Chase, thus, \\"First and foremost was Jack Chase, our noble First Captain of the Top.\\" Melville described Chase, as having fought at the Battle of Navarino and deserted to fight for Peruvian independence. The ship log confirms Melville's narrative, Chase returned to the frigate on 29 May 1842 and was pardoned, at the request of the Peruvian ambassador for his services to the government of Peru.Sharp, John G.M.

Similarly among the officers, Melville's paragon is a Lieutenant, he calls, \\"Mad Jack\\". Melville describes Mad Jack as a model of excellence in chapter, 8 in contrast to an ineffectual Lieutenant whom Melville refers to as \\"Selvagee.\\" \\"Mad Jack is in his saddle on the sea. That is his home...Mad Jack was a bit of tyrant - they say all good officers are- but he sailors loved him all round; and would stand fifty watches with him, than one with a rosewater sailor.\\"White-Jacket, Chapter 8. Mad Jack's original was Lt. Latham B. Avery, who two of Melville's shipmates identified as Mad Jack.Anderson,Ibid,p.363. Melville writes, (chapter 27), ‚ÄúIn time of peril, like the needle to the loadstone, obedience, irrespective of rank, generally flies to him who is best fitted to command.‚Äù Melville recorded one other telling detail about his hero, ‚Äúalas he had one fateful failing. Mad Jack drinks...‚ÄùMelville adds ‚ÄúThough in fine weather he has sometimes betrayed into a glass too many but like a good sailor ‚Äúat Cape Horn even Mad Jack takes the Temperance Pledge outright till that perilous promontory should be far astern.‚ÄùSharp, Ibib, p.3n.27. The log for 15 August and 6 September 1842 confirm Lt. Lantham B. Avery was court marshaled and reprimanded for leaving the deck while he was drunk.Anderson, Ibid.p.364. Another actual crew member is \\"...the Purser, who was a southern gentleman...\\" White-Jacket, Chapter 90. The purser was Edward Fitzgerald, who like many naval officers of the era was a slaveholder.Anderson, Ibid,p.432. On 18 October 1841 Fitzgerald, requested the consent of the Secretary of the Navy, Abel P. Upshur , to entered his \\"servant\\" (slave), Robert Lucas, as a landsman (in reality his personal steward) as a crew member and whose nine dollar per month wages Fitzgerald collected.Parker, Hershel, Herman, Melville A Biography Volume 1, 1819 -1851(Johns Hopkins University Press: Baltimore,1996), p.293.Edward Fitzgerald to A.P.

Commonwealth v Fitzgerald, 7 Monthly Law Reporter (Mass:1844),pp. 379,390. Delbanco, Ibid This important case Commonwealth vs. Edward Fitzgerald re Robert Lucas, became a precedent in the naval service, effectively barring enslaved individuals as seamen. Sharp,Ibid \\"In both the ship log and White- Jacket,mortality is prominent; with Melville relating and the log confirming the various modes of death.\\" For sailors death and burial at sea or on a foreign shore was a commonplace.\\"Sharp, Ibid, p.9. During the long voyage, six crew members died including David Black, the ships cooper,\\"Bungs\\", who fell overboard and perished on 4 October 1843. The actual log entry for 4 October 1843, is terse, ‚ÄúFrom 4 to 8 moderate breezes and clear weather at 5.22 David Black (Cooper) fell overboard, hove to with maintop sail to the mast and sent the Barge & 2nd Cutter in search of him‚Ä¶ at 10.15 wore to the N hove to and hoisted up the 2ndCutter, all search proving ineffectual.\\" Sharp, Ibid. pp. 26-27. In White-Jacket, Chapter 17, headed, \\"Away!

For municipal councils there is a mixed-member system in which wards elect individual councillors alongside those named from party lists. In elections of the National Assembly, every South African citizen who is 18 or older may vote, including (since the 2014 election) those resident outside South Africa.

History  Coloured gathering in South Africa, with large banners demanding votes for all, 1954 =Before Union= When the UK took over the Cape, first in 1795 and then more permanently in 1806, they inherited a sprawling, thinly populated pastoral settlement that depended on the labour of slaves and a rural workforce of indigenous Khoikhoi whose condition was akin to serfdom. In 1806 the entire population of the colony consisted of fewer than 80,000 people: 26,768 whites, 1,200 free blacks (manumitted slaves), 29,861 slaves and 20,426 Khoikhoi.Martin Legassick, The struggle for the Eastern Cape, 1800 ‚Äì 1854, KMM Review Publishing Company, Johannesburg, 2010, p. 5 From early on the British made a determined effort to remodel this society by introducing principles of freedom and equality before the law. In 1807 the British government ended the slave trade and, finally, in 1833 outlawed the practice of slavery throughout the Empire. Under pressure from the humanitarian lobby in the UK, acting in concert with a local missionary campaign, the government abolished the Khoikhoi's serf-like status by the promulgation of Ordinance 50 of 1828.Report of Commission of Inquiry regarding Cape Coloured Population of the Union, U.G. 54 ‚Äì 1937, Government Printer, Pretoria, 1937, p. 212, para. 1034 According to the government's instructions, ‚Äòall Hottentots and other free persons of colour lawfully residing in the Colony are, and shall be, in most full and ample manner, entitled to all and every rights, privileges and benefits of the law to which any other of His Majesty‚Äôs subjects are, or can be, entitled.‚ÄôReport of Commission of Inquiry regarding Cape Coloured Population of the Union, U.G. 54 ‚Äì 1937, Government Printer, Pretoria, 1937, p. 213, para 1034 This became known as the ‚ÄòHottentots‚Äô Magna Carta‚Äô. The equality of all people ‚Äì black or white ‚Äì appeared to be assured. As a result, when municipal boards were set up in the colony's towns and villages from 1836, any male resident who lived in property with a yearly rent of not less than ¬£10 could vote for his town board. From the very beginning, therefore, people of colour were able to participate in local elections.Report of Commission of Inquiry regarding Cape Coloured Population of the Union, U.G. 54 ‚Äì 1937, Government Printer, Pretoria, 1937, p.213, para 1037 This principle of a non-racial franchise was to be entrenched when the Cape was granted representative government in 1853. Part of the reason, no doubt, lay in the desire to give propertied Khoikhoi a greater stake in the political system. In 1850 the Khoikhoi of the Kat River Settlement had risen in rebellion and, though the uprising was defeated, it did concentrate the minds of those colonial officials and politicians who were responsible for drawing up the constitution of 1853. As the Cape's Attorney General, William Porter, famously said: ‚ÄòI would rather meet the Hottentot at the hustings voting for his representative than meet the Hottentot in the wilds with a gun on his shoulder.‚ÄôStanley Trapido, The friends of the natives: merchants, peasants and the political and ideological structure of liberalism in the Cape, 1854-1910, in Shula Marks and Anthony Atmore (eds.), Economy and society in pre-industrial South Africa, Longman, London, 1980, p. 262 In terms of the constitution of 1853, any man who owned property worth at least ¬£25 was entitled to vote for or stand in the Cape's Parliament. By 1886 Africans made up 43 per cent of the vote in six constituencies of the Eastern Cape, and were a real political force.Andre Odendaal, The Founders: The Origins of the ANC and the Struggle for Democracy in South Africa, Jacana, Auckland Park, 2012, p.96 It was not long before white politicians began challenging the rights of Coloureds and Africans to vote. The passage of the Franchise and Ballot Act, which raised the property qualification from ¬£25 to ¬£75 in 1892, met with an angry response from African and Coloured voters.Richard van der Ross, A Political and Social History of the Cape Coloured People, 1880 ‚Äì 1970, Thesis submitted to the University of Cape Town, 1973, UCT Special Collections, p. 11 These developments were not without criticism or opposition. Indeed, the abolition of slavery and the promulgation of Ordinance 50, and the accompanying extension of rights to the black population, were deeply resented by the white Dutch farmers of the Cape as undermining their way of life. Starting in 1834, thousands of these Boers set out on one of the most defining events of white South African history ‚Äì the Great Trek.Great Trek The Dutch who moved away from the Cape did so in the hope of leaving British control and British ways of ordering society behind them. In the interior of southern Africa they would carve out independent states for themselves, the South African (or Transvaal) Republic and the Orange Free State, whose constitutions enshrined the principle of no equality between white and black in either church or state. After the Second Anglo-Boer war, whites made peace with each otherSecond Boer War and in October 1909 came together at the National Convention. Held in Durban it brought together politicians from the Cape, Transvaal, Natal and the Orange River Colony, as well as Rhodesia. Their aim was to draw up a constitution for the a Union of South Africa, uniting the British possessions.South Africa Act 1909 The result was the South Africa Act. Only white men were invited to consider the future of their country; women and all other racial groups were excluded. This was in some ways anomalous. After all, qualified black men had enjoyed the vote in the Cape since the 1850s and ‚Äì as long as they had sufficient property, income and education ‚Äì continued to do so. By 1909 there were 14,388 Coloured and 6,633 African voters in the Cape.L. M. Thompson, The Unification of South Africa, 1902 ‚Äì 1910, Oxford at the Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1960, p. 110 Between them they made up 14.8 per cent of the electorate. In Natal, too, African men had the right to vote, but it was so constrained by hurdles that it was almost theoretical. Not only did they have to prove they had property, but they also had to prove that they were ‚Äòcivilised‚Äô and had been so for seven years. The Governor might then grant them the vote. As we have seen, Indians also had to overcome obstacles designed to prevent them from being enfranchised.L. M. Thompson, The Unification of South Africa, 1902 ‚Äì 1910, Oxford at the Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1960, p. 111 In the Transvaal and Orange Free State only white men could vote. The Cape argued that their non- racial franchise should be extended across the proposed Union. This was rejected by the Transvaal and Orange Free State. Finally a compromise of sorts was arrived at, maintaining the Cape's existing voting system, without extending it to the rest of the country, but insisting that this compromise was entrenched in the constitution.National Archive, Secret Despatch from Selborne to Crewe, 24 October 1908, PRO CO 879/106/8 Africans and Coloured people would retain most of their voting rights in the Cape rights, but would not receive them in any other part of the Union. African and Coloured politicians came together to resist these plans, and called on a former Cape Prime Minister, William Philip Schreiner, to lead a delegation to the UK to call for the Cape franchise to be implemented in the whole of South Africa.William Schreiner This he did, but the delegation was unsuccessful in its appeal, despite receiving considerable support from the infant Labour Party and other liberal British organisations.Martin Plaut, Promise and Despair, the First Struggle for a Non-Racial South Africa, Jacana Press, 2016 =At the Union= The Union of South Africa was created on 31 May 1910 by the South Africa Act 1909, an act of the British Parliament. The House of Assembly (the lower house of the newly created Parliament of South Africa) and the provincial councils were elected by first-past-the-post voting in single- member electoral divisions. The franchise in these elections was initially the same as the franchise for the lower houses in the four colonies that had formed the Union, so there were different qualifications in different provinces. In the Transvaal and the Orange Free State the vote was limited by law to white men over the age of 21. In Natal the vote was limited to men over 21 who met property and literacy qualifications; in theory this could include non-white men but in practice only very small numbers managed to qualify: in 1910 over 99% of the electorate was white. In the Cape Province the franchise was also limited to men over 21 who met property and literacy qualifications, and non-white men did qualify in significant numbers, making up approximately 15% of the electorate in 1910. The qualifications in the Cape and Natal also excluded a substantial number of poorer white men. Only white men could stand for election to the House of Assembly, even from the Cape constituencies. The franchise rights of non-white voters in the Cape (but not in Natal) were entrenched in the South Africa Act by a provision that they could only be reduced by an act of Parliament passed by a two-thirds majority of both houses of Parliament sitting in a joint session. =Enfranchisement of white women and poor whites= In 1930 the National Party government of J. B. M. Hertzog passed the Women's Enfranchisement Act, which extended the right to vote and the right to stand for election to all white women over the age of 21. In the following year the Franchise Laws Amendment Act lifted the property and literacy requirements for white male voters in the Cape and Natal, with the result that all white citizens over 21 were enfranchised. As the exclusion of women and the literacy and property qualifications continued to apply to non- white voters, these acts had the effect of diluting their electoral power by more than doubling the number of white voters. At the next following general election in 1933, Leila Reitz was elected as the first female MP, representing Parktown for the South African Party. =Segregation of black voters= In 1936 the Hertzog government enacted the Representation of Natives Act, which removed black voters from the common voters' rolls and placed them on separate \\"native voters' rolls\\". The act was passed by the required two-thirds majority in a joint session. Black voters could no longer vote in ordinary elections for the House of Assembly or the Cape Provincial Council; instead they would separately elect three members of the assembly and two members of the council. Four senators would also be indirectly elected by chiefs, tribal councils and local councils for \\"native areas\\". The Representation of Natives Act was repealed in 1959 and consequently the seats of the \\"native representative members\\" were abolished in 1960. From this point the only political representation of black South Africans was in the Bantustan legislatures. = Segregation of coloured voters = After coming to power in 1948 the National Party engaged in a policy of removing coloured voters in a similar manner to black voters. In 1951 Parliament passed the Separate Representation of Voters Act, which removed coloured voters from the common voters roll and instead allowed them to separately elect four MPs. The act was challenged on the basis that it had not been passed with a two-thirds majority in a joint sitting, as required by the South Africa Act, and in 1952 the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court declared it to be invalid. A subsequent attempt by the government to circumvent the Supreme Court by creating a High Court of Parliament failed. In the election of 1953, coloured voters in the Cape cast their ballots in the same constituencies as white voters. In 1955 the government introduced a new act which reconstituted the Senate, providing the two-thirds majority necessary to validate the Separate Representation of Voters Act. This separate representation of coloured voters in the House of Assembly was ended in 1970. Instead, all coloured adults were given the right to vote for the Coloured Persons' Representative Council, which had limited legislative powers and was permanently dissolved in 1980. = Republic referendum = In 1960 a whites-only referendum was held to decide whether South Africa should become a republic. No changes were made to the franchise with the Republic's emergence in 1961. However, with the policy of establishing Bantustans the remaining black representation in the Senate was completely removed. = Tricameral Parliament = In 1983 a referendum on constitutional reform was held, as a result of which the Tricameral Parliament was formed, consisting of three separate houses to represent white, coloured and Indian South Africans. The existing House of Assembly was retained with its white electorate, while two new houses were created: the House of Representatives elected by coloured voters, and the House of Delegates elected by Indian voters. Many Indians and Coloureds rejected this powerless government as it was a strategy by the government to divide and rule over the nonwhite vote. Elections to these houses were conducted on the basis of first- past-the-post voting in single-member electoral divisions. = End of Apartheid = During the negotiations to end apartheid the Interim Constitution was enacted. It introduced universal suffrage on a non-racial basis, and replaced first-past-the-post voting with party-list proportional representation. South Africans of all races took part in the first fully democratic elections in 1994. \\"Universal adult suffrage, a national common voters roll, regular elections and a multi-party system of democratic government\\" are founding principles of the 1996 Constitution of South Africa, and the right of all citizens to vote is included in the Bill of Rights. In the post-apartheid era the Constitutional Court has struck down two attempts by the government to deny the vote to convicted criminals in prison. The court has also ruled that South Africans living outside the country must be allowed to vote.  Voting districts  Each voter in South Africa is assigned to a voting district based on the voter's residence at the time that they registered to vote. Each voting district is uniquely associated with a single voting station. Voters who are outside their registered district on election day may vote at another polling station, but additional paperwork is required. Voting districts have no significance outside of the election process, and district boundaries are drawn for purposes of efficiently planning and administering elections. Urban voting districts are drawn so as to have a population of around 3,000 within a radius of , and rural voting districts are drawn so as to have a population of around 1,200 within a radius of . As of 2019, there were 22,933 voting districts nationwide. The district boundaries are set by the Electoral Commission's Delimitation Directorate, and are reviewed and adjusted before each election.

It has long, stiff shoulder straps which raise the lower ribs A training corset is generally a corset used in body modification. A training corset may be used for orthopedic reasons (such as to correct a crooked spine) or for cosmetic reasons (to achieve a smaller waistline, commonly called waist training or in more extreme cases tightlacing.) In addition, the term \\"training corset\\" may refer to a corset which is used to acclimate the body prior to wearing a full corset as an everyday undergarment, or to any corset worn by somebody undertaking training (achieving a desired body shape). Redresseur corset The redresseur corset or preparatory corset was a form of training corset used from the mid-19th century into the early 20th century, designed specifically for young adolescent girls who had not worn stays from an early stage. In addition to moulding a pronounced waist, it served as a back harness and was intended to improve posture. During earlier times in western countries a corset was an everyday item of apparel. In some periods, children were put in stays as soon as they could sit upright or walk. It was believed that the young body was too soft to grow upright on its own. Boys stopped wearing them once they were breeched, i.e. were changed from toddler's dresses to boy's breeches at about 4-7. Girls continued to wear them for their whole lives. It was not until the late 19th century that this practice began to fall away. Orthopedic corsets Corsets may be worn for orthopedic reasons, such as correcting a crooked spine or straightening the back and shoulders. Waist training corsets It was primarily in the 19th century when corsets were used to noticeably reduce a woman's waist in order to achieve a fashionable hourglass figure. The corset was laced progressively tighter, forcing the floating ribs upward and compressing the soft tissue at the waist. This could lead to many negative health ramifications, including difficulty breathing, problems with digestion, and permanent deformity. Waist training, or waist reduction, generally uses an hourglass corset. Waist reduction, sometimes called \\"tightlacing\\", is often used by women who are post-pregnancy or by women involved in BDSM. No structural features distinguish a modern waist training corset from a corset worn as an external garment for special occasions. Training corsets are always made from strong fabric (or leather) and with relatively inflexible boning (not all corsets are strong enough to mold a body). A training corset is designed to be used every day, and will generally be hidden under clothing.

Lilja 4-ever is a story of the downward spiral of Lilja Michailova, played by Oksana Akinshina, a girl in the former Soviet Union whose mother abandons her to move to the United States. The story is loosely based on the true case of Danguolƒó Rasalaitƒó, and examines the issue of human trafficking and sexual slavery. The film received positive reviews both in Sweden and abroad. It won five Guldbagge Awards including Best Film, as well as was nominated for Best Film and Best Actress at the European Film Awards. Plot The film begins with a figure running towards a motorway bridge. When the figure turns around, the film introduces the audience to Lilya Michailova, an adolescent girl who has recently been badly beaten. The film then reveals her past. Lilya lives with her mother in a run-down apartment block in an unnamed former republic of the Soviet Union. Lilya's mother tells her they are emigrating to the United States with the mother's new boyfriend, but instead, she abandons Lilya in the care of her aunt while she and the boyfriend move to America. The aunt moves herself into the larger, nicer flat Lilya and her mother had lived in while forcing Lilya to move into a smaller, squalid apartment. A subsequent succession of humiliations and miseries are heaped upon Lilya. Her best friend encourages her to join her in prostitution, but Lilya declines. When money is discovered in the friend's possession, she lies and says the money belongs to Lilya, whose reputation is subsequently ruined in the community and at school. This culminates in Lilya being raped by a group of boys she knows. She ultimately has to actually become a prostitute to support herself. Meanwhile, Lilya forms another close, protective friendship with a younger boy named Volodya, who is physically abused by his alcoholic single father. She buys Volodya a basketball, but his father punctures it with a pair of scissors. She then meets a young man, Andrei, who becomes her boyfriend and convinces her to move to Sweden, where he says they'll live together. After arriving in Sweden, she is instead met by a pimp who takes her to a nearly empty apartment, where he imprisons and rapes her. Lilya is then forced to perform sexual acts for a large number of clients. Despondent over the departure of the only person who cared about him, Volodya commits suicide, his soul taking the form of an angel. As an angel, Volodya comes to Lilya to watch over her. On Christmas Day, he transports Lilya to the roof of the apartment building where they lived and, deeply regretting having killed himself, gives her the world as a present. However, a disillusioned Lilya rejects it. After an escape attempt, Lilya is violently beaten by her pimp, but she escapes again successfully. With the story arriving full circle to the scene at the beginning of the film, Lilya jumps from the bridge and commits suicide herself. The film's conclusion presents two different endings. One version shows Lilya being sent back in time after killing herself to when she made the decision to go to Sweden with Andrei. However, this time she rejects Andrei's offer, and she and Volodya are shown to presumably live happier lives. In the final scene, Lilya and Volodya are both angels happily playing basketball on the roof of a tenement building. Cast * Oksana Akinshina as Lilya Michailova * Artyom Bogucharsky as Volodya * Lyubov Agapova as Lilya's mother * Liliya Shinkaryova as Lilya's aunt, Anna * Elina Benenson as Natasha * Pavel Ponomaryov as Andrei * Tomasz Neuman as Witek * Anastasiya Bedredinova as Neighbour * T√µnu Kark as Sergei * Nikolai Bentsler as Natasha's boyfriend Production =Writing and pre- production= The script was loosely based on the life of Danguolƒó Rasalaitƒó, a 16-year-old girl from Lithuania whose case had made headlines in Sweden in 2000. A male acquaintance helped Rasalaitƒó travel to Sweden with the promise of a job in Malm√∂. When she arrived, a man referred to as \\"the Russian,\\" who would become her pimp, took her passport and told her she would have to repay him 20,000 SEK ($2410 USD in 1999; $ today) for travel expenses and she was forced to prostitute herself for the next month. She escaped from the apartment where she was being held in the rough suburb of Arl√∂v, moved to Malm√∂ and after three months, day after she had been raped by her boyfriend and two other men, on 7 January 2000 jumped from a bridge and died three days later in the hospital. Three letters she was carrying with her unravelled the story. The screenplay was originally supposed to be deeply religious, with Jesus being a prominent character, walking next to Lilja throughout the story. Moodysson wrote the script in Swedish and then had it translated into Russian. Production was led by Moodysson's usual studio Memfis Film. Co-producers were Film i V√§st, Sveriges Television, and Zentropa. Financial support was provided by the Swedish and Danish Film Institutes as well as Nordisk Film- & TV-Fond. The budget was 30 million SEK. During the casting period, Moodysson and the crew interviewed \\"something like 1000\\" young applicants for the leading roles. The actors had to improvise on a scenario where they had been grounded and were trying to convince their mother to let them go out. While Artyom Bogucharsky had no previous acting experience, Oksana Akinshina had already starred in Sergei Bodrov, Jr.'s 2001 crime film Sisters. Moodysson has commented Akinshina as \\"[not] exactly what I had imagined. She is better than I imagined but different, somehow.\\" =Filming and post-production= Paldiski in Estonia where the film was largely shot. As Moodysson recalls, filming took \\"something like 40 days\\" to finish in total. Outdoor scenes set in the former Soviet Union were shot in Paldiski, Estonia, a former nuclear submarine training centre for the Soviet Navy. Swedish exteriors were filmed in Malm√∂ and studio scenes in Trollh√§ttan. Interpreters had to be present for the Russian actors to be able to understand Moodysson, who in turn had to direct based on emotional impression from the actors' intonation rather than the words. When the lines didn't sound well he would ask the actors to drop the script and improvise. One of the interpreters was Alexandra Dahlstr√∂m, the star from Moodysson's debut feature Show Me Love. Dahlstr√∂m, whose mother is of Russian descent, also served as assistant director, which the producers held as an advantage since she was the same age as the title character. Director of photography was Ulf Brant√•s, who started his career as a cinematographer for Roy Andersson and had filmed both of Moodysson's previous feature films. Lilya 4-ever was shot with an Aaton XTR Prod on 16mm film which was later transferred to 35mm. Minimum lighting was used, mainly from practicals and whenever possible only sunlight. Locations were only sparsely rigged by the crew. A custom built rickshaw, made from the wheels of a mountain bike, was used for the long rearward-facing tracking shots. No correction filters were used though the stock was eventually graded in post- production in order to appear slightly warmer. Release On 23 August 2002, Sonet Film released Lilja 4-ever in Swedish cinemas. Several festival appearances followed including Venice, Toronto, Vancouver, and London Film Festival.Lilya 4-Ever .

International Organization for Migration. Retrieved 2009-12-01. Reception Swedish critics were very positive to Lilja 4-ever upon its release. Malena Janson started her review in Svenska Dagbladet by hailing Moodysson's ability to address different themes and emotional spectra, thereby escaping comparison between his pictures. Janson went on to compare the directing to Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark, but found Lilja 4-ever to be superior: \\"What particularly distinguishes Moodysson's from von Trier's destruction tales and makes it so much more gruesome, are the ties to reality. While we're sitting in the movie theatre and delight and torment ourselves through this masterpiece, happens outside exactly what Lilja encounters perhaps only a few kilometres or miles away from us.\\" The film was fairly successful at the Swedish box office, although significantly less so than Moodysson's previous films. Lilya 4-ever sold 270,000 tickets during the theatrical run, compared to 867,584 and 882,000 respectively for Show Me Love and Together. The film was embraced by most English-language critics as well. As of January 2013, it had an 87% approval from 67 reviews listed at Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The consensus states: \\"A tragic, hard-hitting story about a teenager trapped in a life of prostitution.\\"Lilya 4-Ever. Rotten Tomatoes. Retrieved 2009-11-30. Metacritic gives a score of 82 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". It was rated with four out of five stars by Michael Hayden in the British film magazine Empire, where he praised the performance by Oksana Akinshina and wrote that the film was \\"the darkest of fairy tales, complete with wicked aunts and guardian angels‚Äù while being ‚Äúreminiscent of Ken Loach at his most socially aware‚Äù. Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times noted that the image of the girl lured into prostitution might be a clich√©, but held the director's honest intention as an acceptable excuse: \\"Moodysson wants us to see that there's a real person under the platitudes\\". She also noted that while the story might be unpleasant to take part of, the discomfort is surpassed by the sheer quality of the film: \\"This isn't an easy film -- only a memorable one.\\" A negative review came from Sight & Sound's Tony Rayns. Rayns dismissed the film as melodramatic and lacking in substance, while also criticizing the stylistic choice of the dream sequences, as well as the soundtrack's composition: \\"The most extreme case is [the] use of Rammstein's 'Mein Herz brennt', played at woofer-challenging volume over the opening and closing scenes. ... Even if we take the volume as a metaphor for the girl's wish to block out the world, it's absurd to imagine that Lilja would ever relate to or even listen to a Rammstein track in German. So the wall of sound comes from some 'higher' version of MTV, not from the character or story.\\" Rayns ignored at the time that Rammstein was extremely popular in Russia. Awards and honors Lilya 4-ever won several awards from film festivals around the world including Best Film at Gij√≥n International Film Festival. Akinshina won the awards for Best Actress both in Gij√≥n and at Rouen Nordic Film Festival.Festival Cin√©ma Nordique 2003 . Rouen Nordic Film Festival. Retrieved 2009-11-30. Ulf Brant√•s was prized for Best Cinematography at Zimbabwe International Film Festival and Moodysson won the award for Best Director at Bras√≠lia International Film Festival. The film was the big winner at the 2003 Guldbagge Awards where it received prizes for Best Film, Best Direction, Best Screenplay, Akinshina as Best Actress and Best Cinematography.

It was Sweden's submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 75th Academy Awards, which sparked some controversy when the Academy considered to deem it ineligible since the primary language is not Swedish. Eventually it was accepted, but failed to be nominated. In November 2009 the film magazine FLM published a list of the 10 best Swedish films of the decade as voted by 26 of the country's leading critics. Lilya 4-ever appeared as number three on the list, surpassed only by Involuntary and Songs from the Second Floor.

The 2001 Census recorded a parish population of 2,604, increasing to 2,864 at the 2011 Census. Geography Willington is on the River Trent about southwest of Derby. The parish is within of the Staffordshire county boundary and the village is about northeast of Burton upon Trent. The village is at the crossroads of the north‚Äìsouth B5008 road (for Findern, Repton and Winshill), and the east‚Äìwest A5132 road (formerly the B5009, linking Hilton and Swarkestone). The A5132 carried a lot of Nottingham ‚Äì Stoke-on-Trent traffic before the A50 road was opened in September 1997. History =Toponymy= The toponym Willington is derived from the Old English tun (homestead or farm) among the willows. In the Domesday Book, the village is called Willetune or Willentune, and the land was held by Ralph FitzHubert and was an agricultural village on the flood plain of the Trent. The village is recorded as Wilintun in about 1150 and as Wyliton in 1230. =Manors= Willington, in the hundred of Morleston and Litchurch, comprised two estates as recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, one held by the king in demesne, the other by Ralph FitzHubert: differenced version of their maternal arms of Champernon.Risdon, Tristram (d.1640), Survey of Devon, 1811 edition, London, 1811, with 1810 Additions, p.317 These ancient arms are shown in 19th- century stained glass in Atherington Church impaling the arms of Champernowne Royal manor King Henry II (1154‚Äì1189) gave a manor in Willington to Burton Abbey. This estate was held in 1539 from Burton Abbey by George Finderne, Esquire. John Meynell, Esquire, died seised of it in 1561 and it was sold in 1760 by his descendant Hugo Meynell, Esq. to Sir Henry Harpur, 6th Baronet (1739‚Äì1789), the father of Sir Henry Crewe, 7th Baronet (1763‚Äì1819) who was the proprietor in 1817. No remains survive of the Meynell's manor house.Lysons, Daniel & Samuel, Magna Britannia, volume 5, Derbyshire, 1817, Parishes: Thorpe ‚Äì Youlgreave, pp. 275‚Äì306 de Willington's manor The other manor appears to have been held from FitzHubert by the de Willington family, which took its name from the manor. It appears to have given this manor together with the advowson of the church to Repton Abbey, to whom the tithes were appropriated in 1223. The de Willingtons were later seated at YateRobinson, W.J., West Country Manors, Bristol, 1930, pp.203‚Äì206, Yate Court and Sandhurst in Gloucestershire, and later at Umberleigh in Devon. In about 1554 William Westcote conveyed this manor to Sir John Port (d.1557), founder of Repton School and of the hospital at Etwall, and in 1817 it continued to form part of the estate belonging to those foundations, which also held the tithes and advowson of the vicarage. =Later history= In the 17th century Willington became the highest navigable port on the Trent. It first began to grow from a population of 477 with the construction of the Trent and Mersey Canal in 1777, the same year Bass beer in Burton was started, at which time it became a small inland port and a village with four public houses: the Railway (which was later demolished), the Rising Sun, the Green Man and the Green Dragon, all selling locally brewed beers from Burton upon Trent for the many Irish canal navvies. The village centre and railway station The railway was built in 1838, the railway station being called Repton and Willington railway station and brought the scholars to nearby Repton School. The main-line station was closed in 1964 but a new station was opened in the 1990s as part of the (incomplete) Ivanhoe Line project to link Leicester and Burton-on-Trent and runs mainline trains to Derby, Birmingham and beyond. The village's population increased to 708 by 1940. Trentside Cottage, Bargate Lane is the oldest cottage in the village. A 200-year-old Cedar of Lebanonresponse to planning application mentioning said cedar lies on the site of the now-demolished Potlock's Farm on Twyford Road in the village. Willington Bridge The bridge over the Trent was opened on 7 August 1839, being the only one between Swarkestone and Burton. In 1995 Willington railway station was re-opened at a cost of ¬£565,000 funded by the EU. Economy A former cheese factory in 1920 became a reclaimed aluminium processing plant in 1964 dominating the southern part of the village for twenty years and it was hoped that aluminium car engines would be made nearby for the Toyota Manufacturing UK (TMUK). The site is now closed and the land for sale. Due to the opening of the nearby Toyota car factory (on the A38/A50) in 1992 between Willington (on the former Derby airfield at Burnaston) and Findern, the village has prospered and expanded since the 1980s. Local shops include a post office and newsagent, florist, Co-op supermarket, delicatessen, wools and yarns, beautician, hairdresser, hardware and DIY, general store, pharmacy, a Chinese take-away and the three pubs mentioned above. Willington has an engineering firm, a large GP practice, a Church of England parish church and Baptist ChapelWillington Baptist Chapel and the SOON Ministries literature charity, a large modern primary school and nearby in Etwall (within Willington's catchment area) an expanding secondary school, John Port School. =Willington Power Station= Willington Power Station cooling towers Willington power relays In the 1950s, two coal-fired power stations were built on a site off Twyford Road, between Willington and Findern. The stations were privatised and sold to National Power in the early 1990s and eventually closed in the mid-1990s. Although most of the stations were demolished at the turn of the millennium, the five cooling towers continue to dominate the skyline of the local area. The site was earmarked for a large residential development, but the application was rejected and in 2011 permission was granted for a new power station to be built on the site. In the mid-1990s a pair of peregrine falcons nested in one of the site's huge cooling towers. Unlike many bird of prey breeding sites, this was widely publicised because of its impregnable location. The power station was also the subject of a short documentary by Channel 4 titled \\"Drones in Forbidden Zones\\". =Bus company= Blue Bus Services (Tailby & George Ltd) operated a depot on Repton Road from 1922. The company was privately owned until December 1973 when it was sold to Derby Corporation. Tragically, two years later on 5 January 1976, almost the entire original Blue Buses fleet was destroyed by a fire at the depot. The Saxon Grove and Tailby Drive residential estate was built on the site in the late 1980s (Named after Percy Tailby, co-owner of the Blue Bus Service). Notable residents *John Wetton (1949‚Äì2017), musician, member of King Crimson and founder of Asia. Nature reserve Although some of the former ARC owned aggregate quarry was back-filled with pulverised fuel ash transported via a pipeline from the power station, the remaining gravel pits at the southern edge of the village adjacent to the River Trent have now become a wetland nature reserve managed by the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust and developed with the aid of the Environment Agency. =Views of the nature reserve= image:WillingtonGP1.jpg image:WillingtonGP2.jpg image:WillingtonGP3.jpg image:WillingtonCedarRH.jpgCedar southwest of power station References External links * Pictures Category:Villages in Derbyshire Category:Civil parishes in Derbyshire Category:South Derbyshire District ","title":"Willington, Derbyshire"},{"id":"924103","title":"42nd Infantry Division (United States)"},{"id":"924105","text":"The United States Railroad Administration (USRA) was the name of the nationalized railroad system of the United States between December 28, 1917, and March 1st, 1920.U.S. National Archives. Washington, D.C. Record Group 14, 1917-38. It was possibly the largest American experiment with nationalization, and was undertaken against a background of war emergency.  Background  Although the carriers had made massive investments in the first years of the 20th century, there remained inadequacies in terminals, trackage, and rolling stock. Inflation struck the American economy, and when in 1906 Congress empowered the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to set maximum shipping rates,See Hepburn Act (1906). the rail firms had difficulty securing revenue sufficient to keep pace with rising costs. The ICC did allow some increases in rates, however. Ownership of the United States rail network was divided among 441 distinct corporations. Investors had overexpanded the nation's trackage, so by late 1915 fully one-sixth of the railroad trackage in the country belonged to roads in receivership (bankruptcy). The national railway investment of 17.5 billion dollars, of which more than half was funded debt, had an estimated worth of sixteen billion dollars. European nations engaged in World War I ordered three billion dollars of munitions from United States factories; and most of this production was routed through a few Atlantic port cities. Terminal facilities in these cities were not designed to handle the resulting volume of export tonnage, though German destruction of Allied cargo ships was ultimately a bigger problem. Thousands of loaded railroad cars were delayed awaiting transfer of their contents to ships; they were essentially used as warehouses. This resulted in a shortage of railroad cars to move normal freight traffic. The United States' declaration of war on April 6th, 1917, increased rail congestion by requiring movement of soldiers from induction points through training facilities to embarkation points. The railroad unions (commonly called \\"brotherhoods\\"), desiring shorter working days and better pay, threatened strike action in the second half of 1916. To avert a strike, President Woodrow Wilson secured Congressional passage of the Adamson Act, which set the eight-hour work day as the industry standard.United States. Adamson Act, Sept. 3, 5, 1916, ch. 436, . et seq. When the Supreme Court ruled the law constitutional, the carriers had no choice but to comply.Wilson v. New, . The railroads attempted to coordinate their efforts to support the war by creating the Railroads' War Board, but private action ran into anti-trust and other regulatory barriers. Observers noted, for example, that sometimes competitive practices prevailed that were not in the best interests of efficient mobilization. Also, government departments sought priority for shipment made on their behalf, and congestion in freight yards, terminals, and port facilities became staggering. Finally, in December 1917 the ICC recommended federal control of the railroad industry to ensure efficient operation. The takeover measures were to go beyond simply easing the congestion and expediting the flow of goods; they were to bring all parties‚Äîmanagement, labor, investors, and shippers‚Äîtogether in a harmonious whole working on behalf of the national interest. President Wilson issued an order for nationalization on December 26, 1917.United States. Presidential Proclamation 1419, December 26, 1917, under authority of the Army Appropriation Act, , August 29, 1916. This action had been authorized by the Army Appropriations Act of 1916.Army Appropriations Act of 1916. \\"The President in time of war is empowered, through the Secretary of War, to take possession and assume control of any system or systems of transportation, or any part thereof, and to utilize the same to the exclusion, as far as may be necessary, of all other traffic thereon, for the transfer or transportation of troops, war material and equipment, or for such other purposes connected with the emergency as may be needful or desirable.\\" Federal control extended over the steam and electric railroads with their owned or controlled systems of coastwise and inland water transportation, terminals, terminal companies, terminal associations, sleeping and parlor cars, private cars, private car lines, elevators, warehouses, and telephone and telegraph lines.  Changes and new equipment  Light Mikado was the standard light freight locomotive and the most widely built type of the USRA standard designs. Change happened swiftly. The railroads were organized into three divisions: East, West, and South. Uniform passenger ticketing was instituted, and competing services on different former railroads were cut back. Duplicate passenger services were reduced by eliminating more than 250 trains from eastern railroad schedules to allow increased numbers of freight trains to use crowded lines. Costly and employee-heavy sleeping car services were reduced and extra fares applied to discourage their use. Giving priority to coal trains reduced shortages of locomotive fuel. Ordering all empty box cars to be sent to wheat-producing areas improved the flow of food to European allies. USRA pooled all rolling stock, terminals, port facilities, and shops to reduce congestion in Chicago and New York City. All railroad companies serving those metropolitan areas were given trackage rights over all lines entering the area and equal access to terminal facilities. Available railroad rolling stock inventory of 61,000 locomotives, 2,250,000 freight cars, and 58,000 passenger cars were augmented by new production. Over 100,000 railroad cars and 1,930 steam locomotives were ordered at a cost of $380 million, all of new USRA standard designs. The new rolling stock consisted of up-to-date and standardized types, designed to be the best that could be produced to replace outdated equipment. Before the new USRA standard locomotive types were built and released, locomotives that builders had on hand were issued to various railroads. 2-8-0 \\"Consolidation\\" locomotives built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works for transport and use in France were made available. Then 2-10-0 \\"Decapod\\" locomotives built for Imperial Russia by both ALCO and Baldwin, but stranded in the US by the Russian Revolution of 1917, were also made available to the railroads. The USRA leased these locomotives.  Progression  Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad employee's pass issued by USRA On March 21, 1918, the Railway Administration Act became law, and Wilson's 1917 nationalization order was affirmed.United States. Railway Administration Act of 1918, , . Approved 1918-03-21. Wilson appointed his son-in-law, Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo, as Director General of the newly formed USRA. The law guaranteed the return of the railroads to their former owners within 21 months of a peace treaty, and guaranteed that their properties would be handed back in at least as good a condition as when they were taken over. It also guaranteed compensation for the use of their assets at the average operational income of the railroads in the three years previous to nationalization. The act laid down in concrete terms that the nationalization would be only a temporary measure; before, it was not defined as necessarily so. Both wages and rates for both passenger and freight traffic were raised by the USRA during 1918, wages being increased disproportionately for the lower-paid employees, which proved unpopular among more senior ones. With the Armistice in November 1918, McAdoo resigned from his post, leaving Walker Hines as the Director General.  Winding down  USRA ad from November 1919, promoting travel to California There was support among labor unions for continuing the nationalization of the railroads after the war. However, this position was not supported by Wilson nor the public generally. Because the United States was not a party to the Treaty of Versailles ending the war in 1919, which would have been the legal basis for returning the railroads to private ownership under the Railway Administration Act, legislation was drafted to effect the return. Congress passed the Esch-Cummins Act (Railroad Transportation Act) in February 1920, which substantially increased the ICC's powers over the railroads, and the USRA's authority ended on March 1, 1920.United States. Esch‚ÄìCummins Act, , . Approved 1920-02-28. The ICC was given powers to approve or reject railroad mergers, to set rates, to approve or reject abandonments of service, and additional oversight responsibilities. The government also made financial guarantees to the railroads after control was handed back to them, to ensure their financial survival after the restoration of control.

George became secretary and manager of Aston Villa Football Club in the most successful period of their history. His record of six League Championships and six FA Cups is second only to Ars√®ne Wenger, who has won 7 FA Cups. Early life Ramsay was born at Abbotsford Place in the Tradeston District of Glasgow.https://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/ Statutory register of Births 644/9 154 His father was William Ramsay, an ironmonger, who originated from Perthshire. George's mother was Mary Ann Burrell who was born in Woolwich. Playing career Prior to joining Aston Villa, Ramsay had played for Glasgow Rovers. In 1877 he appeared as a guest player for Welsh club Druids, when they played a fixture against Queens Park. Ramsay came to join Aston Villa almost by accident. Walking past a Villa players' practice match in Aston Park in 1876, he was asked to make up the numbers. Impressed by his skills, the Villa players invited him to join the club, and he soon became captain.https://www.avfc.co.uk/players/g/r/george-ramsay Ramsay later described the newly formed club's approach to the game as 'a dash at the man and a big kick at the ball'.https://spartacus-educational.com/ASTONramsayG.htm He also took charge of training which saw dramatic improvement that showed in the results, introducing what was known as the \\"passing game\\". This had become the main style of play in Scotland whereas in England most teams relied on what was known as the \\"dribbling game\\". In addition to the introduction of a radical change in playing style, Ramsay, along with John Linsay discovered the Wellington Road ground at Perry Barr in 1876, which meant the club was able to charge admission for the first time. He was also responsible for the recruitment of Villa legend Archie Hunter. Hunter later recounted the story in his 1890 memoir Triumphs of the Football Field. Villa played at Perry Barr until 1897 when the club moved to the Aston Lower Grounds, next to Aston Hall, which later became known as Villa Park. Club folklore has it that Ramsay was the first man to kick a ball at Villa Park. Villa gradually improved under his guidance which culminated in Villa winning their first trophy, The Birmingham Senior Cup, in 1880, with Ramsay as captain. Administrative career The hugely successful team Ramsay assembled at the end of the 19th Century. Ramsay can be seen standing on the far left of the back row. Ramsay retired from playing in June 1882, but remained at the club as Secretary from 1884‚Äì1926. This position pre-dates the modern role of a football manager, which meant that Ramsay was responsible for the team. His duties not only involved looking after the players but also included controlling recruitment and transfers, supported by a specialist trainer. The team was selected by the Committee each week, which consisted of such figures as William McGregor and Fred Rinder. He held this position for a remarkable 42 years, in which time Villa won the Football League and FA Cup 6 times each, establishing themselves as the premier football club in England. In 1926, at the age of 71, Ramsay retired as Secretary and became honorary advisor and a vice-president of the Club. His replacement W. J. Smith was unable to continue Ramsay's success, although the club did finish runners-up in the league twice under his guidance. In 1934 Smith stood down and the club decided to appoint its first manager, Jimmy McMullan. The following year Ramsay died at the age of 80. Within a year of his death the Midlands giants were relegated, an unthinkable notion in the Ramsay era. In all Ramsay's association with the football club lasted 59 years, a time which will always be known as Aston Villa's 'Golden Age'. Ramsay was laid to rest at St. Mary's Church, Handsworth, his gravestone reads \\"Founder of Aston Villa\\". Personal life The Glaswegian arrived in Birmingham around 1871 to work as a clerk in a brass foundry, a position he held until he was appointed Villa's Secretary in 1884. He married Fanny Elizabeth Warwick, a native of Aston, in 1893. They had two sons and one daughter.

In early 1955, the Leftist Socialists and the Rightist Socialists reconciled and merged to reform the JSP, months before the Liberal Democrat Party was created through the merger of the Liberal and Democrat parties.

It runs from Interstate 5 (I-5) in the Carmel Valley neighborhood of San Diego to I-15. The eastern terminus of the highway is also the western end of the Ted Williams Parkway. SR 56 serves as an important connector between I-5 and I-15, being the only east‚Äìwest freeway between SR 78 in north San Diego County, several miles away, and SR 52 near Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. It is also named the Ted Williams Freeway, after the San Diego-born baseball player. SR 56 was added to the state highway system in 1959 as Legislative Route 278, and was renumbered SR 56 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Plans in 1964 were to connect SR 56 to the north end of SR 125 and continue east to SR 67, but these plans did not come to fruition. The eastern end from Black Mountain Road to I-15 was completed in 1993; the western end from I-5 to Carmel Creek Road was completed in 1995 after several lawsuits filed by the Sierra Club and other community groups. The two ends were not connected until the middle portion of the freeway was completed in 2004. The delay was largely due to funding issues and environmental concerns. Route description SR 56 west at the Carmel Creek Road interchange Eastbound SR 56 begins as a ramp from the northbound I-5's local bypass lanes. The interchange is not complete; southbound I-5 traffic must exit to Carmel Valley Road before entering SR 56\\\\. Westbound traffic on SR 56 merges into the southbound I-5 local bypass lanes, which provide access to I-805. Continuing east, the route then has an interchange at Carmel Creek Road, which provides access to the nearby San Diego Jewish Academy, and proceeds eastward through a residential area. After passing milepost 2, the freeway has another interchange with Carmel Country Road south of the community of Torrey Hills. SR 56 meets Carmel Valley Road and curves northward, passing Canyon Crest Academy before turning southeastward. The route passes over McGonigle Creek before intersecting Camino Del Sur, which serves the nearby Westview High School. Southeast of Camino Del Sur, SR 56 curves back east, passing under Carmel Mountain Road without an exit. The route encounters exits with Black Mountain Road and Rancho Pe√±asquitos Boulevard in Rancho Pe√±asquitos in a primarily residential area before meeting its terminus at a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-15. Past the bridge over I-15, the road continues as Ted Williams Parkway, ending at Twin Peaks Road in Poway. SR 56 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System; it is not part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. In 2014, SR 56 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 32,000 vehicles between I-15 and the eastern terminus at Ted Williams Parkway, and 81,000 vehicles between Carmel Creek Road and Carmel Country Road, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the freeway. History =Planning and initial construction= Planning for SR 56 started in 1956, according to San Diego Councilwoman Barbara Warden. The route was first added to the California State Highway System in 1959 as Legislative Route Number 278 (LRN 278). The routing ran from LRN 2, which later became US 101, all the way east to LRN 198, which is now SR 67. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, LRN 278 was renumbered SR 56 and was designated to run from I-5 to SR 67. On December 30, 1980, the City of Poway included SR 56 in their city plan extending all the way east through the city to a northern extension of SR 125. In 1983, both the cities of San Diego and Poway supported the extension of SR 56 all the way to SR 67, although Poway wanted the route moved and had reservations about the freeway ending in their city. Nevertheless, there are no plans to construct the portion of SR 56 east of I-15; several arterial roads connect the eastern end of the SR 56 freeway with SR 67, including Ted Williams Parkway, Twin Peaks Road, Espola Road (CR S5), and Poway Road (CR S4). A Bell's vireo, of which the least Bell's vireo is a subspecies Citizens began to lobby for the construction of SR 56 in 1986, in a similar action to efforts for SR 52. As far back as 1987, the Sierra Club opposed the use of sales tax revenue to build the freeway because of environmental concerns. A public forum was held on April 10, 1990, in Rancho Pe√±asquitos. Since funds were not available for constructing the middle of the route, many opposed the construction of the eastern part of SR 56 as a \\"road to nowhere\\". Opposition to the western end of the freeway related to concerns about destruction of \\"farmland, marshland, and willow scrubland\\", the habitat of the endangered least Bell's vireo. The San Diego City Council voted against such widening of Carmel Valley Road on April 12, citing the environmental concerns. Caltrans rejected other routes, and insisted on ending the freeway at I-5 and Carmel Valley Road. The council reversed its decision on May 8; after the public gave several opinions on the matter, Caltrans agreed to set aside for environmental mitigation, and $2 million (about $ in dollars) was to be set aside for the purchase of land for a park near the San Dieguito River. In June 1990, the Del Mar Terrace Conservancy and the Carmel Valley Coalition sued the San Diego City Council to require them to move the western terminus of SR 56 closer to Sorrento Valley. On August 1, the City of San Diego received a petition in which more than 45,000 people requested that the City Council overturn their decision or refer it to a public referendum. The City Council backed down and rescinded the appropriate zoning changes on August 7, in efforts to keep the city from having to run a special election. They also approved the plans for the eastern portion between Black Mountain Road and I-15. Meanwhile, the Carmel Valley Coalition sued the city as well. The California Coastal Commission approved the construction on September 13, and several local residents representing both sides of the debate attended the meeting in Marina del Rey. Construction on the predecessor of SR 56 began on November 16, 1987, the Newland-California Company paying for the work as a local developer. Around 1990, the North City Parkway was completed as a two-lane road between Rancho Pe√±asquitos Boulevard (then Pe√±asquitos Boulevard) and I-15, along the proposed route of SR 56. The first official segment of the freeway from Black Mountain Road to I-15 was constructed next, beginning on July 25, 1991 by Daley Corporation and W.R. Connelly Inc. This was scheduled to open in May 1993, at a cost of $13 million (about $ in dollars). Opposition to the western segment (from I-5 to Carmel Valley Road) persisted. By 1991, the Del Mar Terrace Conservancy filed an appeal with the 4th District Court of Appeals after losing the lawsuit to the city of San Diego and Caltrans. The Sierra Club had also sued the California Coastal Commission. On July 16, 1992, the Sierra Club withdrew its lawsuit after the City of San Diego agreed to work to keep the Pe√±asquitos Lagoon flowing to the ocean and to restore a wetland area. Following the Sierra Club's settlement, the City of Del Mar raised an objection to the club's decision to accept a settlement, since the city had given a $7,000 contribution (about $ in dollars) to the case. The Sierra Club agreed to return the money in August 1992. The Del Mar Conservancy suit continued, and the plaintiffs requested a court order to stop construction. This lawsuit claimed that the state and city had not done enough environmental studies and mitigation. The 4th District Court of Appeals denied an appeal on October 23. In 1993, citizens complained that funds were being diverted from a recreational park to build the freeway, possibly hindering the development of a new elementary school. The segment was finally completed at a projected cost of $27.2 million (about $ in dollars), opening to traffic by 1995. The ramps connecting SR 56 to I-5 were opened between 1997 and 1998; traffic was diverted onto Carmel Valley Road in the meantime. Williams in 1949, soon after leaving San Diego for Boston The freeway is named after Ted Williams, a Hall of Fame baseball player born in San Diego who played for the Boston Red Sox during his 21-year career. The San Diego City Council also considered naming SR 56 after the former governor and San Diego mayor Pete Wilson. The Council voted 7-1 to name it after Williams on May 12, 1992. Since Williams was still alive, the State of California had to approve the name. Lionel Van Deerlin alleged that Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer nominated Wilson for the honor as political ammunition against Councilman Ron Roberts. Williams came to Mt. Carmel High School on July 12, 1992, for the freeway dedication. Kevin McNamara, who had worked with the government to get the name approved despite opposition, was charged $15,000 (about $ in dollars) for the highway signs when the name was official. The freeway was officially named after Ted Williams in 1993 by the Legislature. =Filling the gap= A gap in the freeway remained, nevertheless. Concerns about the missing funds for the freeway date back to 1990. Since the proposed route passed through the open area between Carmel Valley and Rancho Pe√±asquitos, revenue from the Proposition A sales tax hike could not be used. In 1993, a \\"Citizens United for State Route 56\\" group was commissioned to work on the funding issues. Two years later, County Supervisor Pam Slater briefly proposed making SR 56 a toll road in order to raise funds for construction. The city of San Diego agreed to pay $25 million (about $ in dollars), and the state indicated that it would contribute $20 million. Highway 680 was a planned county route that would have run from Encinitas to Rancho Bernardo. The San Diego County Board of Supervisors cancelled the plans in February 1994, respecting the wishes of the city of Encinitas. There were concerns that some of the traffic from this proposed route would now travel on SR 56 instead. On May 17, 1994, $20 million (about $ in dollars) allocated to Highway 680 was given to the SR 56 project. In January 1998, the State Transportation Improvement Program approved a $245 million allocation (about $ in dollars) for the expansion, and hopes were to finish construction by 2000, with traffic projected to decrease by 20 percent on I-15. There were environmental concerns that fostered consideration of four northern alternatives. One of them was chosen in June 1998 by the San Diego City Council, amid concerns that by moving the route away from \\"environmentally sensitive canyons\\", the freeway would be closer to residences. Some of those living in Rancho Glens Estates sued the city over these concerns in August. SR 56 east at Carmel Creek Road; the exits on the sign were constructed with the missing portion of the freeway that was completed in 2004. Construction began on the missing portion of SR 56 on October 21, 1999, amid allegations of a missing Army Corps of Engineers permit, at an estimated cost of $111 million (about $ in dollars). The California Coastal Commission approved the extension on May 10, 2000, after residents lost two lawsuits relating to the proximity of the freeway. Caltrans was required to install a drainage system because of the wetlands; this requirement was similar to a court ruling for a project in the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve. At this time, the completion was estimated to occur in 2004, at a cost of $151 million (about $ in dollars). In October 2000, Carmel Valley Road was extended to Black Mountain Road, providing a paved alternative until SR 56 was completed; commuters had to travel on a unpaved road, one of the only roads between I-5 and I-15 in North County. Local developers contributed $21 million (about $ in dollars) for the construction of the interchange at Camino Ruiz, and construction began on July 11, 2001. An open house was held on the portion of the freeway between the Camino Ruiz (renamed Camino del Sur) interchange and the Black Mountain Road interchange on April 5, 2003. The road was scheduled to open on April 12, 2003, and was projected to decrease the traffic on city streets coming from the extended Carmel Valley Road. The city of San Diego constructed SR 56 from Black Mountain Road to Carmel Mountain Road, and Caltrans built the remaining portion of the route to Carmel Creek Road. The bridges were still under construction in November 2000 on the city portion. San Diego mayor Dick Murphy commissioned the San Diego Freeway Congestion Strike Team to attempt to accelerate stalled freeway projects such as SR 56 in 2001. In May 2001, the City Council allocated another $5.1 million (about $ in dollars) to purchase land to build the freeway. Critics stated that the construction of SR 56 was a short-term solution, and that traffic would return by 2020. FCI Constructors Inc. and W.R. Connelly Inc. won the contract for the Caltrans portion of the new freeway at a bid of $50.2 million (about $ in dollars), with completion scheduled for 2004. The freeway was built with two lanes in each direction, additional land being available to expand to three lanes if necessary. The project continued on schedule through the 2003 California budget crisis, receiving $4.3 million from the state in 2003. In 2004, there were citizen complaints about the lack of a sound wall to reduce the freeway noise in private residences. It took until July 19, 2004, to join the west and east ends of the freeway; a public festival was held on the freeway on July 17\\\\. The cost of completing the middle segment was reported at $220 million in 2004 (about $ in dollars). Citizens complained in 2008 that the bike path along SR 56 was difficult to access from the northern side of the interchange with El Camino Real; however, funding issues prevented the construction of a paved path at the time. =Ramps and bypasses= SR 56 ramps to I-5 The construction of a \\"dual freeway\\" at the western end was scheduled to begin in early 2002, referring to the two carriageways needed for each direction of the freeway. It would require drivers to use the new local lanes to access eastbound SR 56 from I-5 or I-805. The project would allow for trucks to use the new lanes to assist in merging with traffic. The northbound lanes were scheduled to open in February 2006. The southbound I-15 to westbound SR 56 ramp was improved in a construction project in 2005. Concerns about the lack of a ramp from westbound SR 56 to northbound I-5 date back from 1988, because of a projected increase of traffic on local Carmel Valley streets. Planning for the missing ramps at the western end of SR 56 was underway in 2008, despite nearby homeowner opposition. Caltrans agreed not to destroy homes in late June 2008, but concerns about noise and funding remained. On June 13, 2012, Caltrans held a public forum to discuss five proposals to address the missing ramps at the western terminus: *build the westbound to northbound ramp and the southbound to eastbound ramp, *add additional lanes to both SR 56 and I-5, *only build the westbound-to-northbound ramp and add lanes to southbound I-5 and eastbound SR 56, *build the westbound-to-northbound ramp and add lanes on SR 56 only, or *build nothing at all. A Final Environmental Document was scheduled to be released in the middle of 2016. In the meantime, Caltrans has begun studies relating to widening the route to three lanes in each direction, as called for by the 2050 regional plan.

History  Following the defeat of the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) in 1948 at the hands of Japan's two main conservative parties, the Liberal Party and the Democrat Party, the Japan Socialist Party dissolved into chaos and internal bickering between moderates and Marxist‚ÄìLeninists. The SDPJ split, with some of its members forming a moderate and almost centrist social- democratic party while others formed a more radical, socialist, Marxist‚ÄìLeninist party. Both groups claimed the name and are known as the Leftist Socialist Party of Japan and the Rightist Socialist Party of Japan, respectively. The left-wing in Japan was in chaos between 1948 and 1955. In early 1955, the Leftist Socialists and the Rightist Socialists reconciled and merged to reform the JSP, months before the Liberal Democrat Party was created through a merger of the Liberal and Democrat parties. The Leftist Socialists generally had the upper hand in the reunified JSP, causing a few Rightists to leave the party in 1960 to create the Democratic Socialist Party.

These elections determine who, on the national level, takes the position of the head of state ‚Äì the president ‚Äì as well as the legislature.  Federal Level  The federal government of Mexico is made up of three branches of government: the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The executive branch is headed by the president who is also the chief of state and of the army. The legislative branch consists of the Union of Congress and is divided into an upper and lower chamber. The judicial branch is headed by the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation and does not participate in federal elections. = Executive branch = The president of Mexico is elected for a six-year term by direct election of the population. The candidate who wins a plurality of votes is elected president. No president can serve more than a single term in office, therefore every presidential election in Mexico is a non-incumbent election. Mexico does not have an office of vice president.  Eligibility  Candidates for president must be at least 35 years old. They must be Mexican citizens by birth, as must one of their parents. They must have been residents of Mexico for at least 20 years. They also cannot have been either the governor of a state or the chief of government of Mexico City for six months prior to the election. = Legislative branch = The lawmaking authority of Mexico is vested in the Congress of the Union (Congreso de la Uni√≥n) which is composed of two chambers.  Chamber of Deputies  The Chamber of Deputies (C√°mara de Diputados) has 500 members, elected for a three-year term. 300 deputies are elected in single-seat constituencies by plurality. The constituencies are divided among the 32 states based on population. The remaining 200 deputies are elected by proportional representation in five multi-state, 40-seat constituencies. To be eligible to place candidates in the multi-seat districts a party must have candidates in at least 200 of the 300 single-seat districts and must win at least 2% of the vote in those elections. The 200 PR-seats are distributed based on the percentage of the total national votes earned by each party without taking into account the 300 plurality-seats (parallel voting). However, since 1996, a party cannot get more seats overall than 8% above its result nationally (i.e., to win 50% of the legislative seats, a party must win at least 42% of the vote nationwide). There are three exceptions on this rule: first, a party can only lose PR-seats due to this rule (and no plurality- seats); second, a party can never get more than 300 seats overall (even if it has more than 52% of the vote nationally); and third, a party can exceed this 8% rule if it wins the seats in the single-member districts. Deputies may serve up to four consecutive terms.  Chamber of Senators  The Chamber of Senators (C√°mara de Senadores) has 128 members, elected for a six-year term. 96 of these seats are in three-seat constituencies (corresponding to the nation's 31 states and Mexico City, the former Federal District which is the national capital). In these constituencies, two seats are awarded to the party with the most votes and one seat is awarded to the party with the second most votes. The remaining 32 seats are awarded by proportional representation on a nationwide basis. Senators may run for a consecutive term.  Eligibility  Candidates for the Chamber of Senators must be registered voters at least 25 years old. They also must have been born in, or been residents of the states they are running in for at least six months. Electoral magistrates, the Secretary of the Electoral Tribunal, and the Executive Secretary and Executive Director of the INE must separate themselves from their positions for at least three years before seeking legislative office.  State and municipal level  At the local level, each of Mexico's 31 constituent states elects a governor to serve a six-year term; they also elect legislative deputies who sit in state congresses, and municipal presidents (presidentes municipales, or mayors). Mexico City, the national capital, elects a head of government in lieu of a mayor, city assemblymen in lieu of state congressional deputies, and borough mayors in lieu of municipal mayors. = State of Mexico =  Governor  To be a Governor of a state of Mexico: * State-born candidates must have been a resident for three years previous to the election * Mexicans born outside of the state must have been residents for five years previous to the election * Candidates must be at least 30 years old * Candidates cannot have been a minister of any religion for five years previous to the election * Candidates cannot have been in the military or a head of public security forces for 90 days previous to the election * Candidates cannot have citizenship in any country other than Mexico  State legislature  Members of the state legislature (Legislatura del Estado) are elected to three-year terms. Forty-five seats are apportioned in direct elections in single-member districts and 30 are apportioned via proportional appointments. Political parties nominate their candidates for proportional appointments before the election. For a party to be eligible for proportional-appointment seats they must run candidates in at least 30 districts and receive at least 3% of the vote throughout the state. Deputies can serve up to four consecutive terms. Similar to the federal Chamber of Deputies, a party cannot have more than 8% more seats in the legislature than their percentage of state-wide votes (e.g., to win 50% of the legislative seats, a party must win at least 42% of the vote statewide) unless that excess was earned in the direct elections. To be a deputy of the legislature: * State-born candidates must have been a resident for one year previous to the election * Mexicans born outside of the state must have been residents for three years previous to the election * Candidates must be at least 21 years old * Candidates cannot have been a minister of any religion for five years previous to the election * Candidates cannot have worked for any election commission for two years previous to the election * Candidates cannot have been a sitting municipal or federal legislator for 90 days previous to the election * Candidates cannot have been a sitting judge for 90 days previous to the election * Candidates cannot have been in the military or a head of public security forces for 90 days previous to the election * Candidates cannot be a sitting governor  Political parties  Mexico has a multi-party system, with three dominant political parties. Prior to 2000 Mexico had a dominant-party system under the Institutional Revolutionary Party, and a number of smaller opposition parties. Alliances and coalitions are common: normally, they are local (state) affairs and involve one of the big three and any number of minor parties, though in extraordinary occasions two of the big three will ally themselves against the third (e.g., 2003 Colima state election or 2004 Chihuahua state election).  Voter eligibility  In order to be able to vote, all Mexican citizens must obtain a photographic voter identification card from the National Electoral Institute (Instituto Nacional Electoral [INE]). To receive a card, potential voters need: * Proof of either their birth in Mexico or their naturalization * Some form of photo ID * Proof of their residence With these three documents, a potential voter can request their Credentials to Vote card (Credencial para Votar).  Indigenous communities  Article 2 of the Mexican constitution provides for the self-government of indigenous communities according to their 'traditional customs' (Spanish: sistema de usos y costumbres). This has resulted in several indigenous communities in Mexico maintaining local systems, notably those of Cher√°n, and areas under Councils of Good Government control.

It begins at Interstate 8 (I-8) in El Cajon and continues to Lakeside as the San Vicente Freeway before becoming an undivided highway through the eastern part of Poway. In the town of Ramona, the route turns into Main Street before ending at SR 78\\\\. SR 67 provides direct access from the city of San Diego to the East County region of San Diego County, including Ramona and Julian. The route has existed as a railroad corridor since the turn of the 20th century. A highway known as the Julian road was built by 1913, and was designated as Legislative Route 198 in the state highway system by 1935. Route 198 was renumbered SR 67 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. A freeway south of Lakeside was built in the late 1960s, and opened to traffic in 1970. Since then, the portion of the highway north of Lakeside has become known for a high number of traffic accidents and related fatalities. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has made several attempts to remedy the problem and make the road safer. Route description SR 67 north of Poway Road SR 67 begins at I-8 in El Cajon; known as the San Vicente Freeway, it turns north near the Parkway Plaza shopping mall. There are two interchanges in the city of El Cajon: one with Broadway and Fletcher Parkway, and another with Bradley Avenue. Following this, the freeway leaves the El Cajon city limits, entering the city of Santee near Gillespie Field, before coming to an interchange with the eastern end of SR 52 in Santee. Near the Woodside Avenue exit, SR 67 turns northeast, paralleling the San Diego River and entering the unincorporated area of Eucalyptus Hills as it leaves the San Diego urban area. Riverford Road and Winter Gardens Boulevard have interchanges with SR 67. The freeway ends, and SR 67 turns north and becomes an undivided highway at Mapleview Street, crossing the San Diego River and entering the locale of Moreno. SR 67 then enters the rural area east of Sycamore Canyon County Open Space Preserve near the locale of Foster, passing to the west of San Vicente Reservoir. The road intersects the eastern end of Scripps Poway Parkway and County Route S4 (CR S4), the latter within the Poway city limits. In eastern Poway, SR 67 veers east, eventually leaving the city and entering unincorporated Rock Haven. The road continues near Rosemont, California before turning northeast and becoming Julian Road and then Main Street in downtown Ramona. SR 67 ends at the intersection with SR 78; SR 78 intersects to the northwest as Pine Street and continues northeast along Main Street towards Julian. SR 67 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, but is not part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The route is named the CHP Officer Christopher D. Lydon Memorial Freeway from I-8 to Mapleview Street in Lakeside. In 2013, SR 67 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 94,000 between Broadway and Bradley Avenue (the highest AADT for the highway), and 18,100 between Rio Maria Road and Poway Road (the lowest AADT for the highway). History SR 67 near Ramona =Early days= The \\"Julian road\\" had been constructed by 1872, and was used for stagecoaches. In 1883, The San Diego Union and Daily Bee described it as a \\"disgrace to the county. It could hardly be in a worse condition... and should be repaired immediately.\\" On October 21, 1885, the county Board of Supervisors agreed to a realignment of the Julian road, in what was known as the Bernardo District, onto private property. The road was described in 1890 by The San Diego Union and Daily Bee as passing through farms, and the grade was \\"cut on the west side of the canyon and buttressed with granite the greater part of the way.\\" The route continued towards Ramona through vineyards, passing by more boulders. Between 1885 and 1891, the San Diego, Cuyamaca, and Eastern Railroad was extended from San Diego through El Cajon to the town of Foster, northeast of Lakeside. In 1896, the stagecoach line connected the terminus of the railroad line in Foster to Julian, and transported the San Diego newspapers to Ramona by 2:30 pm each day. The county began to survey a new routing of the Julian road in 1913 cutting through the El Monte Ranch, reducing the distance from San Diego to Julian by and removing some steep grades. Bidding was conducted on the Julian road, then known as Road No. 3A, on June 30, 1920; however, progress on the grading of the road fell behind the county engineer's expectations by October, with only of the road complete. The road was paved from Santee to El Cajon by the end of 1920. Between Foster and Julian, the paved road was opened in July 1922, at a cost of $550,000 (about $ in dollars). The \\"Ramona Road\\" remained unpaved between the Mussey Grade and the road to Ballena, a distance of , and the estimated cost of paving it was $400,000 (about $ in dollars). In 1925, there were left of unpaved road between Ramona and Julian, and state and county taxes were to be used to fund this project. The Mussey Grade was completed in April 1925, marking the completion of the paved road between San Diego and Ramona. San Diego County declared the Julian road a county boulevard in 1926, meaning that vehicles were required to stop before entering the highway. The road that would become SR 67 was added to the state highway system in 1933, from El Cajon to near Santa Ysabel, and was designated as Route 198 in 1935. It consisted of Maine and Woodside avenues in Lakeside and Magnolia Avenue in the city of El Cajon all the way to U.S. Route 80 (US 80) at Main Street. Because of the construction of the San Vicente Reservoir north of Lakeside, a section of the road had to be submerged, and it was decided to relocate the road further west by the foot of Mount Woodson. The road was allocated $830,784 in funding (about $ in dollars) to be realigned, widened, and repaved between Lakeside and Mount Woodson in 1942. Grading and paving of the part was scheduled for completion on December 15, 1943. Funding was allocated for traffic signals on the portion between Main Street and Broadway in El Cajon in 1954. Route 198 also extended onto La Mesa Boulevard and Palm Avenue to SR 94. This portion was signed as Sign Route 67 by 1962, from Campo Road to US 80. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, Route 198 was renumbered as State Route 67; the portion south of I-8 was renumbered as SR 125. =Freeway construction= The State Highway Commission decided to reroute SR 67 through Lakeside in 1954, moving it closer to the San Diego River and away from the city center, using the land formerly occupied by the old railroad. In 1961, the construction of the San Vicente Freeway was listed as a high-priority project by the California Chamber of Commerce. During 1964, the county of San Diego received $1 million (about $ in dollars) to construct SR 67 as a freeway from Pepper Drive to Broadway in the city of El Cajon. Another $1 million (about $ in dollars) was allocated in 1965, and the project was extended to I-8. The freeway from I-8 to Pepper Drive was complete by 1967, when Caltrans announced that \\"yellow, non-reflectorized markers interspersed with raised yellow dots\\" would be installed on the freeway portion to delineate the shoulder; this was the first section to use them in the county. By December 1968, the freeway was complete from I-8 north to Woodside Avenue; the grade at the northern end was smoothed out during the widening of the road in early 1970. In March, the freeway was under construction from Woodside Avenue to the San Diego River, at a cost of $3.2 million (about $ in dollars). The freeway portion opened on October 12, 1970; it was constructed four lanes wide. It was planned that SR 67 would be the eastern terminus of SR 56. On December 30, 1980, the City of Poway included SR 56 in the city plan extending east through the city to a northern extension of SR 125. In 1983, both the cities of San Diego and Poway supported the extension of SR 56 to SR 67, although the City of Poway wanted the route moved and had reservations about the freeway ending in the city. There are no plans to construct the portion of SR 56 east of I-15. Several arterial roads connect the eastern end of the SR 56 freeway with SR 67, including Ted Williams Parkway, Twin Peaks Road, Espola Road (CR S5), and Poway Road (CR S4). =Safety concerns= SR 67 south of Ramona The highway portion of SR 67 was popularly known as \\"Slaughterhouse Alley\\" because of the high number of fatal accidents. The road was widened in 1979 to add a shoulder and passing lane between the north end of the freeway and Poway Road. During the construction, there were concerns about speeding cars putting the construction workers in danger. The total cost was $927,000 (about $ in dollars), and Asphalt Inc. performed the work. The reputation of the highway continued into the early years of the 21st century. In 2000, a $1 million project (about $ in dollars) was authorized to widen the shoulders of the road, after there were 413 accidents and 15 fatalities on SR 67 from 1996 to 1999. At this time, County Supervisor Dianne Jacob proposed expanding the highway portion to four lanes along the entire route. Following a safety initiative, including the involvement of law enforcement and trucking companies, accidents and fatalities both decreased by the end of 2001. Accidents continued, however, and by November 2008, electronic signs were installed to inform motorists of their speed, and another publicity campaign had been launched. The reduction from two lanes to one lane heading southbound just after a curve has been blamed for at least some of the accidents, with collisions resulting from cars \\"jockeying\\" to be ahead. Head-on collisions are another source of crashes. Despite this, in 2009 Caltrans did not view the road as unsafe according to official metrics. In May 2009, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) announced that fixing SR 67 was number 17 on its priority list, resulting in an estimated 2030 completion of a four-lane highway that would not be limited-access. A month later, Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol agreed to take more efforts to educate the public about the safety issues. Signs were installed in 2010 to encourage drivers to practice safe driving habits; from January 2007 to early December 2010, twenty-four people died from accidents on SR 67. Following a March 2009 fatal crash, some of the survivors filed a lawsuit against Caltrans for negligence in maintaining and designing the highway, but the suit was decided in favor of the department. In a 2010 report, Caltrans suggested that two lanes could be added along the highway from I-8 to Dye Road in order to improve traffic flow. =Further developments= In 1983, the Kassler Corporation was awarded a contract to renovate the interchange with I-8 for $9.1 million (about $ in dollars). SR 67 from Poway Road to the Poway city limits was proposed to be widened in 1985. There was a movement in 1987 to construct a northbound offramp at Woodside Avenue, due to traffic congestion at the Prospect Avenue offramp; however, it was never built. Call boxes were installed on SR 67 in 1994. There was also a proposal in 2000 to renovate the interchange at Bradley Avenue. The next year, SANDAG approved the construction of a southern bypass of Ramona and widening from Vigilante Road to Dye Road for a cost of $200 million as part of a 2030 transportation plan. The chairman of the Ramona Planning Group suggested calming traffic by using a roundabout instead of widening the highway. The road's guardrails and signs sustained damage in the 2003 Cedar Fire. That year, there were plans to widen Route 67 from Mapleview Street to Dye Road; however, when threatened with a lawsuit from Save Our Forests and Ranchlands, SANDAG agreed to \\"reconsider\\" the project. Traffic jams were prevalent on October 21 and 22 in 2007, during the ongoing local wildfires and the evacuation of Ramona on the narrow road. \\"Heavy construction\\" of SR 52 from SR 125 eastward to SR 67 began in February 2008, after it had been delayed by funding issues that were finally resolved in 2006 with voter-approved statewide transportation bonds. The interchange with SR 52 began to be constructed in mid-June 2008. Completion was scheduled for 2010, but was delayed to early 2011 due to weather-related delays.

The President of Venezuela is elected for a six-year term by direct election plurality voting, and is eligible for re-election. The National Assembly (Asamblea Nacional) has 165 members (diputados), elected for five-year terms using a mixed member majoritarian system. Elections also take place at state level and local level. Since 1998 elections in Venezuela have been automated (using touch-screen DRE voting machines which provide a Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail), and administered by the National Electoral Council. The voting age is 18, and (as of 2011) 95% of eligible voters are legally registered Venezuela has a multi-party system, with numerous parties. The United Socialist Party of Venezuela (Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, PSUV) was created in 2007, uniting a number of smaller parties supporting Hugo Ch√°vez' Bolivarian Revolution with Ch√°vez' Fifth Republic Movement. PSUV and its fore-runners have held the Presidency since 1998. The Democratic Unity Roundtable (Mesa de la Unidad Democr√°tica, MUD), created in 2008, unites much of the opposition. Hugo Ch√°vez, the central figure of the Venezuelan political landscape since his election to the Presidency in 1998 as a political outsider, died in office in early 2013, and was succeeded by Nicol√°s Maduro, initially as interim President, before winning election in April 2013 and re-election in May, 2018. History =1811‚Äì1889: First congress and presidents= On 18 April 1810, agents of the Spanish Regency arrived in the city of Caracas. After considerable political tumult, the local nobility announced an extraordinary open hearing of the cabildo (the municipal council) on 19 April. On that day, an expanded municipal government of Caracas took power in the name of Ferdinand VII, calling itself The Supreme Junta to Preserve the Rights of Ferdinand VII. The Caracas Junta called for the convention of a congress of the Venezuelan provinces which began meeting the following March, at which time the Junta dissolved itself. Francisco de Miranda was elected to the Congress and began agitating for independence. Crist√≥bal Mendoza, first president of the First Republic of Venezuela, took office on July 5, 1811. All three initial presidents had been signatories on the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence. In March 1811 during the Spanish American wars of independence, the first Venezuelan constitutional congress established the executive power a triumvirate in which three men shared executive power and rotated the presidency every week. Crist√≥bal Mendoza became a member of the triumvirate that headed the First Republic of Venezuela and was unanimously elected by the other two as the first to go in rotation on 5 March 1811. Mendoza was author of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence, formally issued on 5 July 1811,In Spanish: Venezuelan Declaration of Independence, Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes on which date the presidential designation also took effect. The first Constitution of the Republic of Venezuela was designed in December 1811.Brice√±o Perozo, Mario. \\"Mendoza, Crist√≥bal de\\" in Diccionario de Historia de Venezuela, Vol. 3. Caracas: Fundaci√≥n Polar, 1999. The Congress established a Confederation called the United States of Venezuela in the Constitution, crafted mostly by lawyer Juan Germ√°n Roscio, that it ratified on 21 December 1811. The Constitution created a strong bicameral legislature and, as also happened in neighboring New Granada, the Congress kept the weak executive consisting of a triumvirate.In Spanish: Federal Constitution of 1811 Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes. The Constitution uses la Confederaci√≥n and los Estados Unidos de Venezuela interchangeably. A second triumvirate followed on April 3, 1812. Brice√±o Perozo, Mario. \\"Mendoza, Crist√≥bal de\\" in Diccionario de Historia de Venezuela, Vol. 3. Caracas: Fundaci√≥n Polar, 1999. . The presidency was disestablished in 1813, when Simon Bolivar established the Third Republic of Venezuela (1817‚Äì1819). In 1830, Jos√© Antonio P√°ez declared Venezuela independent from Gran Colombia and became president, taking office on January 13, 1830. Presidents of Venezuela who served under the 1864 constitution (starting with Juan Cris√≥stomo Falc√≥n) bore the title of \\"President of the Union\\", instead of the usual \\"President of the Republic\\" still used today. Aside from that, all heads of state of the country since 1811 have held the title of \\"President of Venezuela.\\" =1900‚Äì1989: First democratic elections= El Trienio Adeco was a period in Venezuelan history from 1945 to 1948 under the government of Democratic Action, a party which gained office via the 1945 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat against President Isa√≠as Medina Angarita of the two- year-old Venezuelan Democratic Party. El Trienio Adeco saw the first democratic elections in Venezuelan history, beginning with the Constituent Assembly elections held in Venezuela on 27 October 1946, Democratic Action, which won 137 of the 160 seats in the Assembly. Voter turnout was 86.6%.Nohlen, p568 General elections held in Venezuela on 14 December 1947Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume II, p555 are described as the first honest elections in Venezuela. At the time, there were 110 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 46 seats in the Senate, with Democratic Action winning a majority of both. The 1948 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat took place on 24 November 1948, when elected president R√≥mulo Gallegos was overthrown a year after his election. Democracy would not be restored until the 1958 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat overthrew the dictator Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez. A referendum on the presidential term and national and regional governors was held on 15 December 1957, resulting in the referendum's approval. Voters were asked whether they approved of President Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez remaining in power without fresh elections, and appointing government nominees as members of the national parliament, regional assemblies and local councils.Nohlen, p566 The referendum was held under non-democratic conditions. Jim√©nez was overthrown the following year. In the 7 December 1958 general elections, voter turnout was recorded at 94.4% in the presidential election and 92.1% in the Congressional elections. Democratic Action again swept the elections, winning the presidency and two majorities. =1990‚Äì1999: Later constitutions= The 1998 presidential election was the first to be carried out with a new National Electoral Council. Traditionally poll workers had been provided by the parties, but in this election \\"a lottery was set up to draft 300,000 registered voters as poll workers\\". The elections also saw \\"the world's first automated voting system, which featured a single integrated electronic network that was supposed to transmit the results from the polling stations to central headquarters within minutes.\\" The automated vote system enabled the Electoral Council to announce the results within 2.5 hours of the polls closing. After corroborating the results with the Carter Center, the losing candidate conceded several hours later.McCoy, Jennifer (1999), \\"Chavez and the End of \\"Partyarchy\\" in Venezuela\\", Journal of Democracy, 10(3), pp64-77 In the 1998 presidential elections, one of candidate Hugo Ch√°vez's electoral promises was to organize a referendum asking the people if they wanted to convene a National Constituent Assembly. His first decree as president was thus to order such a referendum, which took place on 19 April. The electorate were asked two questionswhether a constituent assembly should be convened, and whether it should follow the mechanisms proposed by the president. The \\"yes\\" vote in response to these two question totalled 92% and 86%, respectively.Wilpert, Gregory. (Venezuela Analysis, 27 Aug 2003). Venezuela‚Äôs New Constitution. Retrieved 9 Nov 2005. The 1998 parliamentary elections were on 8 November 1998. There were 207 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 54 seats in the Senate.Nohlen, p575Nohlen, p573 Under the new Bolivarian 1999 Constitution, the legislative branch of Government in Venezuela is represented by a unicameral National Assembly. The Assembly is made up of 165 deputies (diputados), who are elected by \\"universal, direct, personal, and secret\\" vote on a national party-list proportional representation system. In addition, three deputies are returned on a state-by- state basis, and three seats were reserved for representatives of Venezuela's indigenous peoples. All deputies serve five-year terms. In 1999 a two-term limit of six years each was established for the President of Venezuela. =2000‚Äìpresent: Recent elections= In 2007 the leading Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) party dissolved and the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) formed as the leading government party. On 15 August 2007, PSUV founder and Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez proposed an amendment to 33 articles of Venezuela's 350-article Constitution. Ch√°vez stated that the proposed constitutional reforms were needed to complete the transition to a socialist republic and to implement his Bolivarian Revolution. The proposal was narrowly defeated by 51 to 49 percent. In 2009 a constitutional referendum resulted in the abolition of term limits for the office of President of Venezuela. The 2010 parliamentary elections took place on 26 September 2010 to elect the 165 deputies to the National Assembly. Venezuelan opposition parties (which had boycotted the previous 2005 election, thus allowing the MVR to gain a supermajority) participated in the election through the Coalition for Democratic Unity (MUD).Devereux, Chrlie and Corina Rodriguez Pons. Business Week, 27 September 2010. \\"Venezuela‚Äôs Opposition Pushes Back Chavez in Vote\\".Constitution of Venezuela, article 203 (page 75) The National Electoral council scheduled regional elections for 16 December 2012 to elect state governors and state legislators,Definidas las fechas de elecciones para Gobernadores y Alcaldes Noticias24, 20 September 2011 ‚Äì \\"El 16 de diciembre de 2012 ser√°n las elecciones de Gobernadores y Consejos Legislativos Regionales [...].\\" with PSUV winning the governorships of 20 of the 23 states.PSUV gana 19 gobernaciones Globovision, 16 December 2012 Voter turnout was 53%.Hugo Chavez allies win 20 of 23 Venezuela governorships BBC News, 17 December 2012 Venezuela's municipal elections were delayed from their intended date of 14 April 2013 after the death of President Hugo Ch√°vez on 5 March 2013, as a new presidential election was also scheduled for 14 April. Winning the vote by a narrow margin, Nicol√°s Maduro was sworn in as the new president on 19 April 2013. After around an eight-month delay, municipal elections on December 8, 2013 elected 337 mayors and 2,455 local councillors for their respective 2013‚Äì2017 terms. The parliamentary elections in 2015 took place on 6 December 2015 to elect the 164 deputies and three indigenous representatives of the National Assembly. The result was a decisive defeat for the ruling PSUV, which lost control of the Assembly for the first time since 1999. The Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) won the majority of seats. A week after the 2015 parliamentary elections, the outgoing National Assembly created the \\"National Communal Parliament\\", with President Maduro stating \\"All power to the Communal parliament\\". The move was described as an attempt \\"to sideline and leapfrog the incoming opposition-controlled National Assembly\\". The process to hold a Venezuelan recall referendum to vote on recalling Maduro started on 2 May 2016. In July 2016, the Venezuelan government stated that if enough signatures were collected in the second petition stage, a recall vote would be held no sooner than 2017. However, the government cancelled the recall movement on 21 October 2017, with conventional media describing President Maduro as a dictator following the suspension of movement. After Venezuela entered into a constitutional crisis when the Supreme Tribunal removed power from the National Assembly, months of protests occurred in 2017, resulting in President Maduro calling for the rewriting of the constitution. The 2017 Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election took place, electing all pro-Maduro candidates to the Constituent Assembly of Venezuela, removing power from the National Assembly once again. Voting system =Electoral registration= Under the 1999 Constitution of Venezuela, all Venezuelans over the age of 18 have the right to vote (Article 64). Additionally, long-term resident non-nationals over 18 (resident over 10 years) have the right to vote in regional and local elections (Article 64). Article 56 specifies that everyone has \\"the right to be registered free of charge with the Civil Registry Office after birth, and to obtain public documents constituting evidence of their biological identity, in accordance with the law.\\" According to the National Electoral Council, the proportion of the voting-age population on the Electoral Register has risen from 80% in 1998 to 95% in 2011, with 19m (including nearly 100,000 voters outside Venezuela) registered in 2012 compared with 12m in 2003.Venezuelan Embassy in the UK, 20 May 2012, THE VENEZUELAN ELECTORAL SYSTEM AND THE ELECTIONS OF 2012, accessed 30 April 2013Venezuela en Noticias, 10 February 2012, Venezuela‚Äôs National Electoral Council: Supporting the Venezuelan Opposition Primary Elections Voters register fingerprints and identity card details onto the Electoral Register, and these are to be verified during the voting process. =Electoral system= Venezuela elects at a national level the President of Venezuela as head of state and head of government, and a unicameral federal legislature. The President is elected for a six-year term by direct election plurality voting, and is (since the 2009 Venezuelan constitutional referendum) eligible for re-election. The National Assembly (Asamblea Nacional) has 165 members (diputados), elected for five-year terms (see #Parliamentary voting system below). Party system =Background= R√≥mulo Betancourt voting in the 1946 elections Democracy in Venezuela developed during the twentieth century, with Democratic Action (founded in 1941) and its antecedents playing an important role in the early years. Democratic Action led the government during Venezuela's first democratic period (1945‚Äì1948). After an intervening decade of dictatorship (1948‚Äì1958) saw AD excluded from power, four Venezuelan presidents came from Democratic Action from the 1960s to the 1990s. This period, incorrectly called the \\"Fourth Republic\\" by Hugo Chavez and his followers, is marked by the development of the Punto Fijo Pact between the major parties (originally including the Democratic Republican Union, which later dwindled in significance), with the notable exclusion of the Communist Party of Venezuela. By the end of the 1990s, however, the now two-party system's credibility was almost nonexistent, mostly because of the corruption and poverty that Venezuelans experienced because of the debt crisis developed during the 1980s. Democratic Action's last president (Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez) was impeached for corruption in 1993, and spent several years in prison as a result. The other main traditional party Copei, provided two Venezuelan presidents (Rafael Caldera, 1969‚Äì1974, and Luis Herrera Campins, 1979‚Äì1983). =Current= Confidence in the traditional parties collapsed enough that the 1993 presidential elections were won by Rafael Caldera on around 30% of the vote, representing a new electoral coalition, National Convergence. By 1998, support for Democratic Action and COPEI had fallen still further, and the 1998 election was won by political outsider Hugo Ch√°vez. Since then, a range of newer parties (such as A New Era and Justice First) have been more prominent in opposition to Ch√°vez than the traditional main parties Democratic Action and COPEI. The United Socialist Party of Venezuela (Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela, PSUV) was created in 2007, uniting a number of smaller parties supporting Ch√°vez' Bolivarian Revolution with Ch√°vez' Fifth Republic Movement. It is the lead party of the Great Patriotic Pole coalition. The Democratic Unity Roundtable (Mesa de la Unidad Democr√°tica, MUD), created in 2008, unites much of the opposition. Hugo Ch√°vez, the central figure of the Venezuelan political landscape since 1998, died in office in early 2013, and was succeeded by Nicol√°s Maduro (initially as interim President, before narrowly winning the 2013 Venezuelan presidential election). Polling procedure Since 1998 elections in Venezuela have become more automated, and administered by the National Electoral Council, with poll workers drafted via a lottery of registered voters. Polling places are equipped with multiple touch-screen DRE voting machines, one per \\"mesa electoral\\", or voting \\"table\\". After the vote is cast, each machine prints out a paper ballot, or VVPAT, which is inspected by the voter and deposited in a ballot box belonging to the machine's table. The voting machines perform in a stand-alone fashion, disconnected from any network until the polls close.Consejo Nacional Electoral Manual Operativo para Miembros, Secretaria o Secretario de Mesa Electoral . Retrieved 28 November 2006 Voting session closure at each of the voting stations in a given polling center is determined either by the lack of further voters after the lines have emptied, or by the hour, at the discretion of the president of the voting table. Voters register fingerprints and identity card details onto the Electoral Register, and these are verified during the voting process. Voters sign a register to confirm that they have voted, and have a finger marked with election ink.The Guardian, 14 April 2013, Venezuela votes in hi-tech poll to choose Ch√°vez successor In March 2018, Smartmatic, the electoral product company which had participated in the majority of elections under the Bolivarian government, ceased operations in Venezuela, its native country, stating that they could no longer guarantee the validity of election results through its machines. =Tally scrutinization= After the polls close at any voting table, the following steps are carried out: *The DRE voting machine is ordered to close the voting session. *Tally scrutinization announced. *Each voting machine prints an original tally sheet, each has a voter total and the number of votes cast for each candidate cast in that particular machine/table. *Each voting machine is connected to the network and the results are sent to the vote counting center. *Nine extra tally sheets are printed and distributed to the staff and the six representatives of the candidates that received the most votes. *With the original tally sheet in hand the total number of votes cast is compared to the signed up sheet or electoral notebook. Finally, for those machines chosen for the audit (see below) the electoral ballots, or paper trails, are counted one by one to determine if they add up to the totals in the tally sheet. Any anomaly is mentioned in the tally sheet report, signed by the staff and auditors, and then sealed and given to the military for delivery to the CNE. =Random paper ballot audit= Once the tally scrutinization is complete the staff proceeds to perform a random paper ballot audit of 54.31% of the machines. Each voting center can have anywhere from one to twelve voting machines, occasionally up to fifteen. The staff randomly selects the tables/machines by drawing a number out of a paper hat. The size of the draw is dependent on the number of tables/machines. The following procedures occur step by step: * Polls are closed * Tally scrutinization finishes * Random paper ballot audit announced * The machines are randomly selected drawing numbers out of a paper hat * The machine's serial number is recorded * The corresponding paper ballot box is selected and opened * The paper ballots results for each candidate are openly counted * With the original tally printed from the electronic results, both results are audited * Any anomaly (even if by one vote) is recorded in the audit report * The original audit report is signed by staff and observers, officially sealed and handed to the military for delivery to the CNE * Copies are handed over to the representatives of the two highest vote getters. Parliamentary elections National Assembly of Venezuela =Parliamentary voting system= Elections for the National Assembly of Venezuela in the 2000 and the 2005 were conducted under a weak mixed member proportional system, with 60% elected in first-past- the-post voting districts and the remainder by closed party list proportional representation.CNN, Venezuela (Presidential), accessed 27 September 2010 This was an adaptation of the system previously used for the Venezuelan Chamber of Deputies,Donna Lee Van Cott (2005), From movements to parties in Latin America: the evolution of ethnic politics, Cambridge University Press. p29 which had been introduced in 1993, with a 50‚Äì50 balance between voting districts and party lists,Crisp, Brian F. and Rey, Juan Carlos (2003), \\"The Sources of Electoral Reform in Venezuela\\", in Shugart, Matthew Soberg, and Martin P.

Previously, parties winning nominal district seats had had these subtracted from the total won under the proportional party list, which had encouraged parties to game the system by creating separate parties for the party list.Venezuelanalysis.com, 1 October 2010, A New Opportunity for Venezuela‚Äôs Socialists Under the new law, in 2009, electoral districts were redefined in a way that has been accused of favouring the PSUV, particularly in giving more weight to votes in the countryside over those in the city.Romero, Simon.

One of the first \\"honest\\" presidential elections in Venezuela was held in 1947, with R√≥mulo Gallegos of Democratic Action receiving 74.3% of the vote. The next elections were held in 1958 and won by R√≥mulo Betancourt of Democratic Action, who received 49.2% of the vote. With voter turnout reported to be 92.3%, in the 1963 presidential elections Ra√∫l Leoni of Democratic Action won with 32.8% of the vote.

Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez won a second time in 1988 with 52.9% of the vote, and a voter turnout of 81.9% in the presidential election. Former president Rafael Caldera, newly associated with National Convergence, won with 30.5% of the vote in 1993. The voter turnout in 1993 was 60.2%, the lowest since World War II. After being imprisoned for an attempted coup and then pardoned by Caldera, Hugo Ch√°vez founded the Fifth Republic Movement and was elected president of Venezuela in 1998. He was re-elected in 2000. A recall referendum in 2004 was voted on by the populace to determine whether Ch√°vez should be recalled from office, resulting in no recall (58% no). The authenticity of the results became a point of contention.Weisbrot M, Rosnick D, Tucker T (20 September 2004).

It was entered into the 49th Berlin International Film Festival. It stars Gillian Anderson, Ellen Burstyn, Sean Connery, Anthony Edwards, Angelina Jolie, Jay Mohr, Ryan Phillippe, Dennis Quaid, Gena Rowlands, Jon Stewart and Madeleine Stowe. Plot Playing by Heart is an ensemble work, that explores the path of love in its character's lives. Among the characters are an older couple, whom about to renew their wedding vows (Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands); a theatre director (Gillian Anderson) and architect (Jon Stewart) navigating a new beginning; a gay man dying of AIDS (Jay Mohr) and his mother (Ellen Burstyn) who had not been close; a couple having an affair (Anthony Edwards and Madeleine Stowe) and her husband (Dennis Quaid) who is exploring ways to break, through the staleness of their marriage. As the film continues, and the stories evolve, the connections between the characters become evident. Kellie Waymire, Nastassja Kinski, Alec Mapa, Amanda Peet and Michael Emerson also have roles in the film.

The consensus summaries: ‚ÄúIt's overly talky, but Playing by Heart benefits from witty insights into modern relationships and strong performances from an esteemed cast.‚Äù The film was released in the United Kingdom on August 6, 1999, and opened on #11. Roger Ebert gave it a thumbs down (2.5 stars) due to its entertaining dialogue, star power and charming moments, but determines it to be a 'near miss' because of its soft, gooey center. It was one of the last films reviewed on air, by film critic Gene Siskel, on Siskel and Ebert at the Movies, before his death on February 20, 1999. Like Ebert, Siskel gave it a thumbs down, deeming the film more about behaviour than story.\\"Gene's last show 23 January 1999\\". Siskel&Ebert.org.; Retrieved 24 January 2012.

The vehicles were to be rapidly deployable, network-enabled, capable of operating across the spectrum of operations, and protected against current threats. The programme has now been split into two separate procurement projects for a reconnaissance Specialist Vehicle (SV) and an aspiration for a future Utility Vehicle (UV). The General Dynamics Ajax was selected to fulfill the SV requirement in 2016. History The total FRES fleet was to be divided into two main parts, the Utility Variant (FRES UV) and the Specialist Variant (FRES SV). These types were further broken down into various families of vehicles: The Utility Variant comprises protected mobility, command and control, light armoured support, repair and recovery and medical; the Specialist Variant comprises RECCE Block 1 (Scout, armoured personnel carrier, repair, recovery and Common Base Platform) and RECCE Block 2 (Joint Fires Direction, Command Post and Engineer Recce). Despite long delays in the procurement process, exacerbated by a budget shortfall at the MoD, the FRES programme is moving ahead with the award of the Specialist Vehicle contract to General Dynamics UK for the ASCOD AFV tracked vehicle in March 2010. Due to the complexity of the FRES programme, a \\"System of Systems\\" Integrator (SOSI) was appointed to assist the MoD in selection of the vehicles and cross-vehicle electronic architecture. In October 2007, the FRES SOSI contract was awarded to a joint team of Thales and Boeing. The SOSI team was contracted to act as an independent, honest broker between industry and the MoD to co-ordinate the procurement of more than 3,000 vehicles which were expected to be acquired under FRES. Six main elements of the SOSI role were: programme management; systems of systems engineering and integration; alliance development and management; development of the MoD's SOSI competence; through-life capability management; and through-life technology management. The SOSI role was scrapped when the programme was restructured following the failure to progress with the UV procurement. =FRES Utility Vehicle= The first family of vehicles, known as the Utility Vehicles (UV) were expected to enter service in the 2010s. FRES UV was to have replaced the Army's Saxon wheeled APC, tracked FV432, and some of the CVR(T) vehicle family.Design selected for future armoured vehicle for British Army The design is planned to follow the philosophy of \\"medium weight\\" forces that balance ease of transportability (\\"light\\") with armour (\\"heavy\\"). FRES UV competition GTK Boxer of the German Army In 1999, Germany and United Kingdom began development of the Boxer Multi Role Armoured Vehicle, which was intended to assume different roles via switchable modules. However, the UK announced it would withdraw from the project in 2003, stating that the Boxer did not fulfill requirements.Written Answers for 17 July 2003 House of Commons Hansard - URL accessed on 2 May 2006 The British Ministry of Defence decided to pursue a replacement, with a specification that it could be airlifted by Airbus A400M and smaller C-130 Hercules transport aircraft.

Written Answers for 21 July 2005. House of Commons Hansard. URL accessed on 23 April 2006. On 7 June 2007, the then Minister of State for Defence Equipment and Support, Lord Drayson, announced that three vehicles had been selected for trials to determine the utility vehicle design for FRES UV. These were:Ministry of Defence  Defence News  Drayson: New vehicles will have \\"vital part to play in the Army of the future\\" * Boxer, built by ARTEC Germany. * Piranha V, built by General Dynamics UK. * VBCI, built by Nexter (France). Response to criticism In a defence briefing on 14 June 2007, Lord Drayson made it clear that FRES UV would not be the standard off-the- shelf version of any of these vehicles: > They are designs which are currently in development to provide new models > within existing families of vehicles. I am sure you agree that it would make > no sense to invent a new vehicle from scratch. The designs we will look at > in the trials this summer take proven vehicles, and evolve them to the next > level to have the capacity, mobility, ability to upgrade through life, and, > above all, the level of protection the Army need.Quoted in Defence News > Daily In FRES UV it was envisaged that a further role, that of the \\"vehicle integrator\\", would be required to ensure that the vehicles are customised to meet British Army requirements and be supported and upgraded through life. A number of companies positioned for this role, including BAE Systems and General Dynamics, but when the programme was restructured this was no longer envisaged as a separate role. FRES UV Preferred Bidder The announcement of the winning design was initially planned for November 2007, but the selection was not announced until 8 May 2008. The winning design provisionally selected for the FRES Utility Vehicle contract was the Mowag Piranha V, manufactured by General Dynamics.Ministry of Defence  Defence News  Design selected for future armoured vehicle for British Army (FRES) This decision had been expected, with speculation from February 2008 onwards that General Dynamics was the preferred contractor for the deal. However, as no production order was announced, various sources \\"feared that the FRES programme had fallen victim to the UK defence \\"budget crunch\\". This was borne out in December 2008, when General Dynamics' status as preferred contractor for the Utility Vehicle contract was officially rescinded. =Demise of FRES as a programme= After General Dynamics had its preferred bidder status for UV withdrawn in December 2008, the Ministry of Defence decided to restructure the programme. The utility vehicle programme was scheduled to restart towards the end of 2010.Army Technology: Piranha V Wheeled 8x8 Utility Vehicle The UK MoD's Defence Equipment and Support agency has focused its attention on the tracked variants of the FRES programme; most notably the Specialist Vehicle. The FRES Integrated Project Team (based at MoD Abbey Wood) has disbanded, and the SV has been joined with the Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme (WCSP) in a new procurement team named Medium Armoured Tracks Team (MATT). The two programmes share the Common Cannon and Ammunition Programme, whereby a new 40mm Cannon from CTAI will be the main armament to both the upgraded Warriors and the new Specialist Vehicle. With the demise of the UV procurement, the supporting roles of SOSI and VI were no longer required, and were not pursued as part of the overall procurement scheme. FRES as an overarching programme effectively no longer exists, with future UV and SV projects being separate armored vehicle procurements.

Biography Nakazawa was born in Hiroshima and was in the city when it was destroyed by an atomic bomb in August 1945. Most of his family members who had not evacuated died as a result of the explosion after they became trapped under the debris of their house, except for his mother and an infant sister (who died several weeks later whether from malnutrition or radiation from her mother afterward). In 1961, Nakazawa moved to Tokyo to become a full-time cartoonist and produced short pieces for manga anthologies such as Sh≈çnen Gaho, Sh≈çnen King, and Bokura. Following the death of his mother in 1966, Nakazawa returned to his memories of the destruction of Hiroshima and began to express them in his stories. Kuroi Ame ni Utarete (Struck by Black Rain), the first of a series of five books, was a fictional story of Hiroshima survivors involved in the postwar black market. Nakazawa chose to portray his own experience in the 1972 story Ore wa Mita, published in Monthly Sh≈çnen Jump. The story was translated into English and published as a one-shot comic book by Educomics as I Saw It. Immediately after completing I Saw It, Nakazawa began his major work, Hadashi no Gen (Barefoot Gen). This series, which eventually filled ten volumes, was based on the same events as I Saw It but expanded and fictionalized, with the young Gen Nakaoka as a stand-in for the author. Barefoot Gen depicted the bombing and its aftermath in extremely graphic detail, with Gen's experiences being even more harrowing than Nakazawa's own. It also turned a critical eye on the militarization of Japanese society during World War II and on the sometimes abusive dynamics of the traditional family. Barefoot Gen was adapted into a trilogy of live action movies, two animated films, and a live action TV drama. Nakazawa announced his retirement in September 2009, citing deteriorating diabetes and cataract conditions. He cancelled plans for a Barefoot Gen sequel. In September 2010, Nakazawa was diagnosed with lung cancer; in July 2011, metastasis from lung cancer was found. He died on December 19, 2012.

In mathematics, Volterra's function, named for Vito Volterra, is a real-valued function V defined on the real line R with the following curious combination of properties: * V is differentiable everywhere * The derivative V ‚Ä≤ is bounded everywhere * The derivative is not Riemann-integrable. Definition and construction The function is defined by making use of the Smith‚ÄìVolterra‚ÄìCantor set and \\"copies\\" of the function defined by f(x) = x^2 \\\\sin(1/x) for x eq 0 and f(0) = 0. The construction of V begins by determining the largest value of x in the interval [0, 1/8] for which f ‚Ä≤(x) = 0. Once this value (say x0) is determined, extend the function to the right with a constant value of f(x0) up to and including the point 1/8. Once this is done, a mirror image of the function can be created starting at the point 1/4 and extending downward towards 0. This function will be defined to be 0 outside of the interval [0, 1/4]. We then translate this function to the interval [3/8, 5/8] so that the resulting function, which we call f1, is nonzero only on the middle interval of the complement of the Smith‚ÄìVolterra‚ÄìCantor set. To construct f2, f ‚Ä≤ is then considered on the smaller interval [0,1/32], truncated at the last place the derivative is zero, extended, and mirrored the same way as before, and two translated copies of the resulting function are added to f1 to produce the function f2. Volterra's function then results by repeating this procedure for every interval removed in the construction of the Smith‚ÄìVolterra‚ÄìCantor set; in other words, the function V is the limit of the sequence of functions f1, f2, ... Further properties Volterra's function is differentiable everywhere just as f (as defined above) is. One can show that f ‚Ä≤(x) = 2x sin(1/x) - cos(1/x) for x ‚â† 0, which means that in any neighborhood of zero, there are points where f ‚Ä≤ takes values 1 and ‚àí1\\\\. Thus there are points where V ‚Ä≤ takes values 1 and ‚àí1 in every neighborhood of each of the endpoints of intervals removed in the construction of the Smith‚ÄìVolterra‚ÄìCantor set S. In fact, V ‚Ä≤ is discontinuous at every point of S, even though V itself is differentiable at every point of S, with derivative 0. However, V ‚Ä≤ is continuous on each interval removed in the construction of S, so the set of discontinuities of V ‚Ä≤ is equal to S. Since the Smith‚ÄìVolterra‚ÄìCantor set S has positive Lebesgue measure, this means that V ‚Ä≤ is discontinuous on a set of positive measure. By Lebesgue's criterion for Riemann integrability, V ‚Ä≤ is not Riemann integrable. If one were to repeat the construction of Volterra's function with the ordinary measure-0 Cantor set C in place of the \\"fat\\" (positive-measure) Cantor set S, one would obtain a function with many similar properties, but the derivative would then be discontinuous on the measure-0 set C instead of the positive- measure set S, and so the resulting function would have a Riemann integrable derivative.

Instead of the standard EADGBE tuning, the six guitar strings are tuned, from low to high, D2 A2 D3 G3 A3 D4. Tuning to DADGAD from standard is accomplished by tuning the first, second and sixth strings down a whole step (two frets). The result is an open D suspended fourth chord (see suspended chord). Being suspended, the open tuning is neither intrinsically major nor minor. History DADGAD was popularised by British folk guitarist Davey Graham.Bensusan, P: DADGAD Music: Compositions from Spices and Wu Wei, page 8, John August Music / Mel Bay Publications, 1996 Inspired by hearing an oud player in Morocco, Graham experimented with detuning some of the guitar's strings from standard tuning (E2 A2 D3 G3 B3 E4), arriving at D2 A2 D3 G3 A3 D4 or \\"DADGAD\\". He employed the tuning to great effect in his treatments of Celtic music, but also the folk music of India and Morocco. The first guitarists in Irish traditional music to use the tuning were M√≠che√°l √ì Domhnaill and D√°ith√≠ Sproule; today it is a very common tuning in the genre. Other proponents of the tuning include Roy Harper, Ben Howard, Andy Mckee, Russian Circles, Mike Dawes, Alejandro Aranda, Rory Gallagher, Luka Bloom, Stan Rogers, Jimmy Page, Artie Traum, Pierre Bensusan,Bensusan, P: The Guitar Book, HAL Leonard Publishing Corporation, 1985 Bensusan, P: The Intuite Guitar Book, DADGAD Music (France), 2003 Eric Roche, Midnight, Laurence Juber, Tony McManus, Bert Jansch, Richard Thompson, Dick Gaughan, Alistair Hulett, Imaad Wasif, Mark Kozelek, Jeff Tweedy, Masaaki Kishibe, Paul McSherry, Acle Kahney (uses a 7 string variation, B F B E F B E), Sevendust (although downtuned), Kotaro Oshio, Ben Chasny, Al Petteway, Lankum and Trey Anastasio. English folk musician Martin Carthy now mostly uses a related tuning, CGCDGA, whose explicit evolution from DADGAD he describes in his book.Carthy, M: A Guitar in Folk Music, New Punchbowl Music, 1987. The suitability of DADGAD to Celtic music stems from the fact that it facilitates the use of a number of moveable chords which retain open strings.http://opendtuning.com/dadgad-chords/ These act as a drone on either the bass or treble strings, approximating the voicings used in traditional Scottish and Irish pipe music.

Geer became involved with the young Harry Hay, who later became a homosexual activist.Kevin Starr, Golden Dreams: California in an Age of Abundance 1950‚Äì1963, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 469 In 1934, Hay met Geer at the Tony Pastor Theatre, where Geer worked as an actor. They became lovers, and Hay credited Geer as his political mentor. Hay and Geer participated in a milk strike in Los Angeles. There Hay was first exposed to radical gay activism in the person of \\"Clarabelle\\", a drag queen who held court in the Bunker Hill neighborhood and who hid Hay from police. Later that year, Hay and Geer performed in support of the San Francisco General Strike, where they witnessed police firing on strikers, killing two.Hay, Harry; Roscoe, William.

The Trouble with Harry Hay: Founder of the Modern Gay Movement, Boston: Alyson Publications 1990 Early career Geer made his Broadway debut as Pistol in a 1928 production of Much Ado About Nothing, created the role of Mr. Mister in Marc Blitzstein's The Cradle Will Rock, played Candy in John Steinbeck's theatrical adaptation of his novella Of Mice and Men, and appeared in numerous plays and revues throughout the 1940s. From 1948 to 1951, he appeared in more than a dozen movies, including Winchester '73 (as Wyatt Earp), Broken Arrow, Comanche Territory (all 1950) and Bright Victory (1951). Geer became a member of the Communist Party of the United States in 1934. Geer was also influential in introducing Harry Hay to organizing in the Communist Party. In 1934, Geer and Hay gave support to a labor strike of the port of San Francisco; the 1934 West Coast waterfront strike which lasted 83 days. Though marred by violence, it was an organizing triumph, one that became a model for future union strikes.Michael Bronski \\"The real Harry Hay\\", Boston Phoenix, October 31, 2002 Geer became a reader of the West Coast Communist newspaper People's World.Denning, Michael, The Cultural Front: The Laboring of American Culture in the Twentieth Century, Verso (1998), , , p. 14 Geer became a dedicated activist, touring government work camps of the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s with folk singers such as Burl Ives and Woody Guthrie (whom he introduced to the People's World and the Daily Worker. Guthrie later wrote a column for the latter paper). In 1956, the duo released an album together on Folkways Records, titled Bound for Glory: Songs and Stories of Woody Guthrie. In his biography, Harry Hay described Geer's activism and their activities while organizing for the strike.Stuart Timmons, The Trouble With Harry Hay: Founder of the Modern Gay Movement (1990), pp. 64 & 67 Geer is credited with introducing Guthrie to Pete Seeger at the 'Grapes of Wrath' benefit which Geer organized in 1940 for migrant farm workers. Geer acted with the Group Theatre (New York) studying under Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford and Lee Strasberg. Geer also acted in radio, appearing as Mephistopheles (the Devil) in the 1938 and 1944 productions of Norman Corwin's The Plot to Overthrow Christmas.\\"The Plot to Overthrow Christmas: Norman Corwin\\", Tangent online He also acted in the radio soap opera Bright Horizon. Blacklist Geer was blacklisted in the early 1950s for refusing to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. As a result, Geer appeared in very few films over the next decade. Among them was Salt of the Earth (1954) which starred and was produced, directed and written by blacklisted Hollywood personnel. It told the story of a miners' strike in New Mexico from a pro-union standpoint. The film was denounced as \\"subversive,\\" and faced difficulties in its production and distribution as a consequence. Later years In 1951 Geer founded the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum in Topanga, California, with his wife, Herta Ware. He combined his acting and botanical careers at the Theatricum, cultivating every plant mentioned in Shakespeare's plays. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Geer played several seasons at the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Connecticut. In addition, he created a second \\"Shakespeare Garden\\" on the theater's grounds. By this time he was also working sporadically again on Broadway. In 1964 he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical for 110 in the Shade. In 1972, he played the part of \\"Bear Claw\\" in Jeremiah Johnson along with Robert Redford. In 1972, he was cast as Zebulon Walton, the family patriarch on The Waltons, a role he took over from Edgar Bergen, who played the character in the pilot. He won an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for The Waltons in 1975. Geer maintained a garden at his vacation house, called Geer-Gore Gardens, in Nichols, Connecticut. He visited often and attended the local Fourth of July fireworks celebrations, sometimes wearing a black top hat or straw hat and always his trademark denim overalls with only one suspender hooked. Geer also had a small vacation house in Solana Beach, California, where his front and back yards were cultivated as vegetable gardens rather than lawns. When Geer died, shortly after completing the sixth season of The Waltons, the death of his character was written into the show's script. His final episode, the last episode of the 1977‚Äì78 season, depicted his being reunited with his onscreen wife Esther (played by Ellen Corby; she had been absent for the entire season, due to a stroke). Geer's character was mourned onscreen during the first episode of the 1978‚Äì79 season. His former wife, actress Herta Ware, was best known for her performance as the wife of Jack Gilford in the film Cocoon (1985). Geer and Ware had three children, Kate Geer, Thad Geer, and actress Ellen Geer. Ware also had a daughter, actress Melora Marshall, from another marriage. Although Geer and Ware eventually divorced, they remained close for the rest of their lives. As Will Geer was dying on April 22, 1978, of respiratory failure at the age of 76, his family sang Woody Guthrie's \\"This Land Is Your Land\\" and recited poems by Robert Frost at his deathbed. Geer's remains were cremated; his ashes are buried at the Theatricum Botanicum in the \\"Shakespeare Garden\\" in Topanga Canyon, near Santa Monica, California.Wilson, Scott.

Career Meares' father was Charles Meares, \\"formerly an attorney of great eminence, and for several years pursuivant of his Majesty's Court of Exchequer in Dublin\\".The Gentleman's Magazine for August 1790, Vol.LX, Part II, no.2, death notices for 31 July, p. 767. In 1771, Meares joined the Royal Navy as a captain's servant and was commissioned a lieutenant in 1778. In 1783 he joined the merchant service and in 1785, based in India, formed the Northwest America Company for collecting sea otter furs by trade with the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast and selling them in China. The East India Company held a monopoly on British trade in the Pacific and required all British traders to be licensed with the company and pay duties. Meares did not license his ships with the East India Company and instead tried to conceal the illegal activity by using the flag of Portugal. Meares registered his ships in Macau, a Portuguese colony in China. Non-British ships were not required to have licences from the East India Company. He sailed from Calcutta on 12 March 1786, in the Nootka, a vessel of 200 tons (bm), with which he explored part of the coast of Alaska. He spent the winter of 1786‚Äì1787 in Prince William Sound with poor provisions; his men suffered from the weather and scurvy. Twenty-three of his men died of scurvy and the remaining ten were saved only by the timely arrival of Captain George Dixon, a British trader with proper licences, in the Queen Charlotte. Meares gave Dixon his bond never to trade in the Northwest again, and returned to China by way of the Sandwich Islands. Showing no gratitude to Dixon, Meares proceeded to sue him for allegedly overcharging him for the supplies that saved his life. The launch of the North-West America at Nootka Sound, 1788 In 1788, and in total violation of what he had told Dixon, Meares started a new expedition with two vessels and more false papers. The ships sailed under the Portuguese flag and were given Portuguese names: the Felice Adventurero, captained by Meares, and the Iphigenia Nubiana, under William Douglas. The names are spelled in various ways, such as Feliz Aventureira and Efigenia Nubiana.Meares, John, Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online They sailed from China on 22 January 1788 and arrived at Nootka Sound, on Vancouver Island in May. Using Nootka Sound as a base of operations he spent the summer trading for furs along the coasts of present-day British Columbia and Washington down to after having sailed as far south as Cape Lookout, having missed the Columbia River at Cape Disappointment. Meares later claimed that Maquinna, a chief of the Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka) people, sold him some land on the shore of Friendly Cove in Nootka Sound, in exchange for some pistols and trade goods, and that on this land some kind of building was erected. These claims would become a key point in Britain's position during the Nootka Crisis. Spain strongly disputed both claims, and the true facts of the matter have never been fully established. Maquinna himself later called Meares a liar and denied selling him any land. The land and building aside, there is no doubt that Meares' men, and a group of Chinese workers they brought, built the sloop North West America. It was launched in September 1788, the first non- indigenous vessel built in the Pacific Northwest. In September Meares left, sailing the Felice Adventurero to China. The Iphigenia Nubiana and North West America wintered in the Hawaiian Islands. While on the island of Kauai, Meares picked up a Hawaiian chief or \\"prince of Attooi\\" (Kauai) by the name of Tianna (Ka ªiana ‚Äì also spelled Tyaana & Tyanna), whom he took aboard his ship. He took Tianna to Guangzhou (Canton), China, where Meares found a Hawaiian women by the name of Win√©e, who had been left there by captain Charles William Barkley of the Imperial Eagle. Eventually, Meares returned Tianna to his homeland but Win√©e died of illness on the voyage home. Win√©e and Tianna are considered the first two Hawaiians to have traveled abroad. Later, Meares gained possession of Barkley's nautical gear and his journal. Barkley's wife, Frances Barkley, later wrote that Meares, \\"with the greatest effrontery, published and claimed the merit of my husband's discoveries therein contained, besides inventing lies of the most revolting nature tending to vilify the person he thus pilfered.\\"BARKLEY, Frances, ABCBookWorld During the winter of 1788‚Äì89 Meares was in Guangzhou (Canton), China, where he and others formed a partnership called the Associated Merchants Trading to the Northwest Coast of America. Plans were made for more ships to sail to the Pacific Northwest in 1789, including the Princess Royal, under Thomas Hudson, and the Argonaut under James Colnett. The consolidation of the fur trading companies of Meares and the Etches (King George's Sound Company) resulted in James Colnett being given the overall command. Meares instructed Colnett to establish a permanent fur trading post at Nootka Sound based on the foothold accomplished by Meares the year before. The Iphigenia Nubiana and North West America were to join the Argonaut and Princess Royal at Nootka Sound. Meares himself remained in China. = Nootka Crisis = While the British fur traders were getting organized, the Spanish were continuing their effort to secure the Pacific Northwest. At first the Spanish were responding mainly to Russian activity in Alaska. On a 1788 voyage to Alaska, Esteban Jos√© Mart√≠nez had learned that the Russians were intending to establish a fortified outpost at Nootka Sound. This, in addition to the increasing use of Nootka Sound by British fur traders, resulted in the Spanish decision to assert sovereignty on the northwest coast once and for all. Plans were laid for Nootka Sound to be colonized. Spain hoped to establish and maintain sovereignty on the entire coast as far north as the Russia posts in Prince William Sound. The Viceroy of New Spain, Manuel Antonio Fl√≥rez, instructed Mart√≠nez to occupy Nootka Sound, build some kind of structure, and to make it clear that Spain was setting up a formal establishment. Mart√≠nez arrived at Nootka Sound on 5 May 1789. He found three ships already there. One was Meares' Iphigenia Nubiana. Mart√≠nez seized the ship and arrested its captain, William Douglas. After a few days Mart√≠nez released Douglas and his ship and ordered him to leave and not return. Douglas heeded the warning. The other two ships were American, the Columbia Rediviva and the Lady Washington, under John Kendrick and Robert Gray, which had wintered at Nootka Sound. Over the summer a number of other ships arrived. The vessels of Meares' company were all seized on the grounds of violating Spanish rights of trade and navigation on the coast. The North West America was renamed Santa Saturnina and used by Jos√© Mar√≠a Narv√°ez to explore the Strait of Georgia in 1791. When news of the seizures reached Meares in China he sailed to England. He arrived in April 1790, confirmed various rumors, claimed to have bought land and built a settlement at Nootka before Mart√≠nez, and generally fanned the flames of anti-Spanish feelings. He submitted a report to the Home secretary William Wyndham Grenville, in which he exaggerated the permanence of his settlement in Nootka Sound and the financial losses sustained by his company. In May the issue was taken up in the House of Commons as the Royal Navy began to make preparations for hostilities.The Nootka Crisis, pp. 1-3, Canadian Military Heritage An ultimatum was delivered to Spain. War was averted with the Nootka Convention, which led to George Vancouver's historic voyage in . = Later life = In 1790, Meares published Voyages Made in the Years 1788 and 1789, from China to the North West Coast of America in 1790. It gained widespread attention, especially in light of the developing Nootka Crisis. Meares not only described his voyages to the northwest coast, but put forward a grand vision of a new economic network based in the Pacific, joining in trade widely separated regions such as the Pacific Northwest, China, Japan, Hawaii, and England. His vision required a loosening of the monopolistic power of the East India Company and the South Sea Company, which between them controlled all British trade in the Pacific. Meares argued strongly for loosening their power. His vision eventually came to pass, in its general form, but not before the long struggle of the Napoleonic Wars was over. Meares' Voyages also caused a controversy; Meares' criticisms of George Dixon led the latter to publish a pamphlet about Meares' self-aggrandizement and false claims of discoveries made by others. Meares' claim that Captain Robert Gray had circumnavigated Vancouver island was disclaimed by Gray himself. The explorations of Captain George Vancouver disproved a number of Meares' other claims. Nonetheless, Meares' claims formed a basis for negotiation of British title to Oregon and British Columbia. Not much is known of Meares' life after the settlement of the Nootka controversy. So far as is known he received none of the Spanish indemnity money. He was rewarded for his role by promotion to the rank of commander on 26 February 1795. The marriage of \\"John Meares Esq. of Frome, [Cornwall], to Miss Mary Anne Guilleband, at the Abbey church, Bath\\" was noted in The Whitehall Evening Post of 9 July 1796. Meares apparently considered Bath his home after his retirement from the Navy, and according to his \\"last will and testament\\" he owned property in Jamaica. The death of John Meares, \\"a Commander in his Majesty‚Äôs Navy\\", at Bath on 29 January 1809, was noted in a newspaper advertisement by his solicitors inviting his creditors to a meeting at the George and Vulture Tavern, Cornhill, London, to take consideration of the state of his affairs. The value of his estate when probated was estimated to be under ¬£7,500. His will listed no spouse or child, but a brother and sister were among the beneficiaries. Perhaps his wife, the former Mary Ann Guilliband, whom he married in 1796, was already deceased.

He is best known in France for his live performances‚Äîfour of his albums were recorded live. Life and career He is the son of the French singer Jacques Higelin and Nicole Courtois, and half brother of singers Iz√Øa Higelin and stage and film actor, theatre director and music video director K√™n Higelin. After traveling in the West Indies, he studied music in Boston before returning to Paris and developing his eclectic but highly personal musical style, drawing on such influences as Thelonious Monk, Serge Gainsbourg, the Sex Pistols, jazz, blues, Middle Eastern music and the tango. He first performed in 1988 in clubs in Paris, as leader of a trio with bassist Brad Scott and drummer Paul Jothy. His first album, Arthur H (1990), combined rhythmic experimentation and bal- musette elements with a vocal style which has been compared to Tom Waits. He toured widely around this time, particularly in France and Japan, adding a fourth band member, Jon Handelsman (saxophone), and produced a second album, Bachibouzouk (1992). In early 1993, he did a six-week season at the Magic Mirrors, an antique circus big top, which was later put on as a touring show and recorded on the live album En chair et en os. In 1996, he released the album Trouble F√™te, following which he performed a season at the Gymnase in Paris. The live album F√™te Trouble (1997) included some tracks from these shows as well as others recorded on tour in Africa. He toured the USA and Canada in 1998. In 2000, he wrote the soundtrack for Michel Couvelard's film, Ins√©parables, before touring in Asia and Canada. His next album, Pour Madame X (2000), featured the touring band of Nicolas Repac (guitar), Brad Scott (double bass) and Laurent Robin (drums). In 2001, he took part in the show Le Cabaret Imprudent with \\"Le Cirque Cahin-caha\\". The following year, he released the album Piano Solo, recorded live in a studio and mainly consisting of solo interpretations of earlier songs. This was followed by a band album, N√©gresse Blanche (2003), comprising tracks dedicated to the memory of famous women such as Marilyn Kaddish and Bo Derek. In 2005, a planned tour of China was cancelled, and he returned to the studio to record the album Adieu Tristesse. This was the most commercially successful of his career, and included several duets, one with his father and another, \\"Est-ce que tu aimes?\\", with the musician -M- (Matthieu Chedid). He subsequently toured widely in France, Lebanon and Canada. In 2006, he published a book, Onirique attaque, containing lyrics, reflections and photographs. He also composed the soundtrack for the film L'homme qui r√™vait d'un enfant, directed by Delphine Gleize. The soundtrack was performed by an ensemble of children from a local music school. The album Show Time, issued late in 2006, was recorded live on tour and includes duets with Matthieu Chedid, Pauline Croze, Lhasa de Sela and Jacques Higelin. In June 2008 he released the album L'Homme du Monde, which won the award of Pop/Rock Album of the Year 2009 at La Victoire de la Musique.\\"Arthur H re√ßoit la Victoire de la musique de l'album pop/rock de l'ann√©e\\" His 2010 double CD, Mystic Rumba, contained 24 songs from his repertoire performed solo at the piano, the result in part of a snow storm which cut the power in his studio during recording.HMV.com The next album, Baba Love, was released in October 2011.

In 1845, he was made Professor of Physics at the Royal Naval School in Naples and in 1847 was appointed as Chair of Physics at the university. In 1848, he began working at the Vesuvius Observatory and in 1854 was appointed as Director of the Observatory. Using an electromagnetic seismometer for the detection and measurement of ground tremors, Palmieri was able to detect very slight movements in trying to predict volcanic eruptions. Furthermore, he was the first to detect the presence of Helium on Earth on the lava of Mount Vesuvius.Stewart, Alfred Walter (2008). Recent Advances in Physical and Inorganic Chemistry. BiblioBazaar, LLC. p. 201. . Using a modified Peltier electrometer, he also carried out research in the field of atmospheric electricity. Other scientific contributions included the development of a modified Morse telegraph, and improvements to the anemometer and pluviometer.

It was developed by GKN Sankey from earlier projects, AT 100 IS and AT104, and was due to be replaced by the Future Rapid Effect System. It was first produced by Alvis plc. Design The Saxon was intended to act as a cheap but efficient \\"battle-taxi\\" for units that would have to make long journeys from the UK to reinforce the British Army of the Rhine. It was made as a relatively low cost armoured personnel carrier based on a revised Bedford M series 4x4 truck chassis and other commercially available components. As a lightly armoured wheeled vehicle, it is much faster - especially on roads - and easier to maintain than a tracked vehicle. Indeed, it shares many parts with commercial trucks, reducing the operating cost. It is armoured against small-arms fire and shell splinters, but is not intended to stand up to any anti-vehicle weaponry. The vehicle has a single machine gun for local air defence. The Saxon's hull is welded steel with a V-shaped under-chassis plate to deflect mine detonations. Seating is provided in the rear for up to ten troops, although eight is a more comfortable load if all their equipment is included. There is an equipment stowage area on the hull roof. Some Saxon IS, or Saxon Patrol, vehicles were acquired for service in Northern Ireland, serving as ambulances or troop carriers, which had extendible wings that could be used as protective shields during a riot. Compared to the standard model, these have various minor modifications intended for internal security operations, such as searchlights and wire cutters. History A Hong Kong Police Force Tactical Unit Saxon AT105, all retired in 2009. The first operational Saxons were deployed in Germany in 1983, to equip mechanised infantry battalions. The Saxon has now been withdrawn from service in HM Armed Forces, but 147 are kept in storage. The Saxon has been deployed to places such as Bahrain, Brunei, Bosnia, Malaysia, Oman, Iraq and Afghanistan. Seven Saxons were ordered by the Royal Hong Kong Police from GKN Sankey in 1987 and delivered in 1988 where they replaced 15 Saracens. They were assigned to the Police Tactical Unit and remained there until withdrawn in 2009. 75 Saxons were sold to Ukraine reportedly under a contract made in 2013, i.e. predating the start of the War in Donbass. The Ukraine military announced the deal on 5 December 2014. The former chief commander of British land forces, General Sir Richard Dannatt, said that supplying the vehicles to Ukraine was \\"immoral\\" as they were \\"useless\\" in the type of high intensity warfare they were being deployed in.

After their first 1999 self-titled album, their subsequent album L‚Äôhomme √† tue-t√™te released in May 2001 gained them media acclaim and public popularity. By the time their 2004 album Des singes et les moutons enhanced their repertoire, they were selling out venues such as La Cigale and touring internationally. Songs from their latest album Les Promesses were featured in their first concert at the oldest music hall in Paris, the Olympia, where they played to a full house on May 16, 2006. The band acknowledges influences from traditional French music and Irish music, rock, klezmer, and many styles that are considered dance hall music, such as gypsy jazz, tango, waltz. Background Debout Sur Le Zinc members have described themselves as an Irish folk group synthesized with a rock band. Simon Mimoun and Olivier Sulpice met Christophe Bastien and C√©dric ‚ÄúMomo‚Äù Ermolieff in high school. Simon met Fred Trisson at university, and Fred introduced the band to his childhood friend Romain Sassigneux. They began performing together in bars and on the street and with groups such as Gar√ßons Bouchers and Les Ogres de Barback under the name Debout Sur Le Zinc as of 1996. William Lotvi joined as their bass player in 1998. The idea for the name Debout Sur Le Zinc, literally ‚Äústanding on the zinc,‚Äù originally came after a concert in which Christophe, guitarist/singer was standing on the bar counter playing the accordion. The discovery that the bar or zinc‚Äîthe material bar countertops were once made of‚Äîused to serve as a stage for people to recite poems, sing or make political speeches, and the expression also being in a poem by Jacques Pr√©vert further reinforced the name.

Hayden was best known for his major role as an anti-war and civil rights activist in the 1960s, authoring the Port Huron Statement and standing trial in the Chicago Seven case. In later years he ran for political office numerous times, winning seats in both the California Assembly and California Senate. At the end of his life he was the director of the Peace and Justice Resource Center in Los Angeles County. He was married to Jane Fonda for 17 years, and was the father of actor Troy Garity. Early life and activism Thomas Emmet Hayden was born in Royal Oak, Michigan, to parents of Irish ancestry, Genevieve Isabelle (n√©e Garity) and John Francis Hayden. His father was a former Marine who worked for Chrysler as an accountant and was also a violent alcoholic. When Hayden was 10, his parents divorced, and his mother raised him. Hayden attended a Catholic elementary school, where he read out loud to nuns and \\"learned to fear hell\\". Hayden grew up attending a church led by Charles Coughlin, a Catholic priest noted for his anti-Semitic teachings, and who was also known nationally during the time of The Great Depression as the \\"radio priest\\". Hayden's dismay with Coughlin caused him to break with the Catholic Church as a teenager. Hayden attended Dondero High School in Royal Oak, Michigan. He served as the editor for the school newspaper, and in his farewell column in the newspaper, he used the first letter of successive paragraphs to spell \\"Go to hell\\". As a result, when he graduated in 1956, he was banned from attending his graduation ceremony and only received a diploma. Hayden then attended the University of Michigan, where he was editor of the Michigan Daily. At the National Student Association convention in Minneapolis in August 1960, Hayden witnessed a dramatic intervention by Sandra Cason. To a standing ovation she turned back a motion denying support for sit-ins in the struggle against racial segregation: ‚ÄúI cannot say to a person who suffers injustice, ‚ÄòWait,‚Äô And having decided that I cannot urge caution, I must stand with him.‚Äù Alan Haber of the fledgling Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) recruited her on the spot. Stirred by her \\"ability to think morally [and] express herself poetically,\\" Hayden soon followed her into the left-wing grouping. They married in October the following year.

On December 10, 1961, the Haydens participated in one of the many ‚Äúfreedom rides‚Äù taking place in response to the 1960 Boynton v. Virginia decision. It was from a prison cell in Albany, Georgia, where their ride was to land him, that Hayden began writing the SDS manifesto. The Port Huron vision and SDS Refined and adopted at the first SDS convention in June 1962, the Port Huron Statement called for a \\"new left\\" committed, in the spirit of participatory democracy, to \\"deliberativeness, honesty [and] reflection.\\"The Port Huron Statement. http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/sixties/HTML_docs/Resources/Primary/Manifestos/SDS_Port_Huron.html The sponsoring League for Industrial Democracy (LID) took immediate issue. The Statement omitted the LID's standard denunciation of communism: the regret it expressed at the \\"perversion of the older left by Stalinism\\" was too discriminating, and its references to Cold-War tensions too even handed. Hayden was called to a meeting where, refusing any further concession, he clashed with Michael Harrington (as he later would with Irving Howe).Todd Gitlin (1993).

She later recalled that in contrast to the interminable debates she had witnessed in Ann Arbor, in SNCC discussions the focus was on action and women had a voice. The Haydens divorced in 1965.

By the end of 1964 ERAP had ten inner-city projects engaging 125 student volunteers.Kirkpatrick Sale (1973), SDS: The Rise and Development of The Students for a Democratic Society. Random House, pp. 86‚Äì87 President of the United Packinghouse Workers of America Ralph Helstein arranged for Hayden to meet with Saul Alinsky. With twenty-five years experience in Chicago and across the country, Alinsky was considered the father of community organizing. To Helstein's dismay Alinsky dismissed Hayden's venture into the field as naive and doomed to failure. Hayden's view of the poor and of what could be achieved by consensus was just absurdly romantic.Sanford Horwitt (1989) Let Them Call Me Rebel: The Life and Legacy of Saul Alinsky. New York. Alfred A. Knopf. p. 525 Hayden committed himself to the effort. For three years in Newark he worked with a community union to organize poor black residents to take on slumlords, city inspectors and others. He was there to witness the 1967 Newark Riots which, in Rebellion in Newark (1967), he tried to place in a larger social and economic context.Tom Hayden (1967), Rebellion in Newark: Official Violence and Ghetto Response, Vintages Books His profile in Newark attracted the attention of the FBI. ‚ÄúIn view of the fact that Hayden is an effective speaker who appeals to intellectual groups and has also worked with and supported the Negro people in their program in Newark,\\" agents recommended that he \\"be placed on the Rabble Rouser Index.‚ÄùMichael Finnegan (October 23, 2016). \\"The radical inside the system‚Äô: Tom Hayden, protester-turned-politician, dies at 76.\\" Los Angeles Times https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-tom-hayden-snap- story.html Hayden was later to suggest that if ERAP across the country had failed to build to greater success (the promised \\"interracial movement of the poor\\") it was because of the escalating U.S. commitment in Vietnam: \\"Once again the government met an internal crisis by starting an external crisis.\\"McDowell, Manfred (2013), \\"A Step into America: The New Left Organizes the Neighborhood,\\" New Politics Vol. XIV No. 2, pp. 133‚Äì141 https://newpol.org/review/step-america/ Anti-war activist In 1965, while still committed in Newark, Hayden, along with Communist Party USA member Herbert Aptheker and Quaker peace activist Staughton Lynd, undertook a controversial visit to North Vietnam and Hanoi. The three toured villages and factories and met with an American POW whose plane had been shot down. The result of this tour of North Vietnam, at a high point in the war, was a book titled The Other Side.\\"New Force on the Left: Tom Hayden and the Campaign Against Corporate America\\" by John H. Bunzel, Hoover Press, 1983, p. 8\\"The Other Side\\" by Staughton Lynd, Tom Hayden, New American Library, 1967 Staughton Lynd later wrote that the New Left disavowed \\"the Anti-Communism of the previous generation\\", and that Lynd and Hayden had written, in Studies on the Left: \\"We refuse to be anti-Communist. We insist the term has lost all the specific content it once had.\\"\\"From Here to There: The Staughton Lynd Reader\\" by Staughton Lynd, Andrej Grubaƒçiƒá, PM Press, 2010, p. 101 In 1968, Hayden joined the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (\\"the Mobe\\"), and played a major role in the protests outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois. The demonstrations were broken up by what was later called by the U.S. National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence \\"a police riot\\". Six months after the convention, he and seven other protesters including Rennie Davis, Dave Dellinger, Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin were indicted on federal charges of conspiracy and incitement to riot as part of the \\"Chicago Eight\\", a.k.a. the \\"Chicago Seven\\" after Bobby Seale's case was separated from the others. Hayden and four others were convicted of crossing state lines to incite a riot, but the charges were later reversed and remanded on appeal. The government did not re-try the case, and thereafter elected to dismiss the substantive charges. United States v. Dellinger, 472 F.2d 340 (7th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 970, 93 S.Ct. 1443, 35 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973). Hayden made several subsequent well-publicized visits to North Vietnam as well as Cambodia during America's involvement in the Vietnam War, which had expanded under President Richard M. Nixon to include the adjoining nations of Laos and Cambodia, although he did not accompany his future wife, actress Jane Fonda, on her especially controversial trip to Hanoi in the spring of 1972. The next year he married Fonda and they had one child, Troy Garity, born on July 7, 1973. In 1974, he appeared in a brief scene as an ER doctor in the film Death Wish. In the same year, while the Vietnam War was still ongoing, the documentary film Introduction to the Enemy, a collaboration by Fonda, Hayden, Haskell Wexler and others, was released. It depicts their travels through North and South Vietnam in spring 1974. Hayden also founded the Indochina Peace Campaign (IPC), which operated from 1972 to 1975. The IPC, operating in Boston, New York, Detroit and Santa Clara, mobilized dissent against the Vietnam War and demanded unconditional amnesty for U.S. draft evaders, among other aims. Jane Fonda, a supporter of the IPC, later turned this moniker into a name for her film production firm, IPC Films, which produced in whole or in part, movies and documentaries such as F.T.A. (1972), Introduction to the Enemy (1974), The China Syndrome (1979), Nine to Five (1980) and On Golden Pond (1981). Hayden and Fonda divorced in 1990. New Left legacy Writing about Hayden's role in the 1960s New Left, Nicholas Lemann, national correspondent for The Atlantic, said that \\"Tom Hayden changed America\\", calling him \\"father to the largest mass protests in American history\\", and Richard N. Goodwin, who was a speechwriter for presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and John F. Kennedy, said that Hayden, \\"without even knowing it, inspired the Great Society.\\" Staughton Lynd, though, was critical of the Port Huron and New Left concept of \\"participatory democracy\\", stating: \\"We must recognize that when an organization grows to a certain size, consensus decision-making is no longer possible, and some form of representative government becomes necessary.\\"\\"From Here to There: The Staughton Lynd Reader\\" by Staughton Lynd, Andrej Grubaƒçiƒá, PM Press, 2010, p. 104 In 2007, Hayden made news for his speech at the wedding of his son Troy, where, as Hilton Als wrote in The New Yorker, he \\"said that he was especially happy about his son's union with actress Simone Bent, who is black, because, among other things, it was 'another step in a long-term goal of mine: the peaceful, non-violent disappearance of the white race.'\\" Career in electoral politics During 1976, Hayden made a primary election challenge to California U.S. Senator John V. Tunney. \\"The radicalism of the 1960s is fast becoming the common sense of the 1970s\\", the New York Times reported him saying at the time. Starting far behind, Hayden mounted a spirited campaign and finished a surprisingly close second in the Democratic primary. He and Fonda later initiated the Campaign for Economic Democracy (CED), which formed a close alliance with then Governor Jerry Brown and promoted solar energy, environmental protection and renters' rights policies, as well as candidates for local office throughout California, more than 50 of whom would go on to be elected. Hayden later served in the California State Assembly (1982‚Äì1992) and the State Senate (1992‚Äì2000). During this time, he was frequently protested by conservative groups, including Vietnamese refugees, veterans of the U.S. military and Young Americans for Freedom. He mounted a bid in the Democratic primary for California Governor during 1994 on the theme of campaign finance reform and ran for Mayor of Los Angeles during 1997, losing to incumbent Republican Richard Riordan. As a member of the State Assembly, Hayden introduced the bill that became Chapter 1238 of the California Statutes of 1987. Chapter 1238 enacted Section 76060.5 of the California Education Code. Section 76060.5 allows the establishment of \\"student representation fees\\" at colleges in the California Community Colleges System. The fee has been established at several dozen colleges, and it may be used \\"to provide support for governmental affairs representatives of local or statewide student body organizations who may be stating their positions and viewpoints before city, county, and district governments, and before offices and agencies of state government\\". Student representation fees are used to support the operation of the Student Senate for California Community Colleges. During 1999, Hayden made a speech for the Seattle WTO protests. During 2001, he unsuccessfully sought election to the Los Angeles City Council. Hayden served as a member of the advisory board for the Progressive Democrats of America, an organization created to increase progressive political cooperation and influence within the Democratic Party. He served on the advisory board of the Levantine Cultural Center, a nonprofit organization founded in Los Angeles in 2001 that champions cultural literacy about the Middle East and North Africa. During January 2008, Hayden wrote an opinion essay for the Web site The Huffington Post endorsing Barack Obama's presidential bid in the Democratic primaries.\\"An Endorsement of the Movement Barack Obama Leads\\", The Huffington Post, January 27, 2008. In that same year, he helped initiate Progressives for Obama (now called Progressive America Rising), a group of political progressives that provided assistance for Obama in his initial presidential campaign. Hayden was known widely in California as a staunch endorser of animal rights and was responsible for writing the bill popularly known as the Hayden Act, which improved protection of pets and extended holding periods for pets confined as strays or surrendered to shelters. In 2016, Hayden ran to be one of California's representatives to the Democratic National Committee. Though he originally leaned towards Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic Presidential Primary, Hayden later announced he would support Hillary Clinton and cast his vote for her when the primary reached California. He also claimed that he never endorsed Sanders and only supported his campaign with the hopes that it would push Hillary towards the Left. In his tribute to Hayden following his death, former US President Bill Clinton stated: \\"Hillary and I knew him for more than thirty years and valued both his words of support and his criticism.\\" Hayden insisted to the end that he remained a radical. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Jefferson in terms of democracy,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Thoreau in terms of environment, and Crazy Horse in terms of social movements.‚ÄùGodfrey Hodgson (October 27, 2016). \\"Tom Hayden obituary, The Guardian. https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/27/tom-hayden-obituary In his last years, however, he also described himself as \\"an archeological dig.\\"http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/9/18/tom-hayden- archivesuniversitymichigan.htmlhttp://tomhayden.com/biography/ Academic career Hayden was a teaching assistant at the University of Michigan Journalism Department in the early 1960s. The Law of the Press was one of the courses he taught. Hayden taught numerous courses on social movements, two at Scripps College--one on the Long War and one on gangs in America--and a course called \\"From the '60s to the Obama Generation\\" at Pitzer College. He also taught at Occidental College and at Harvard University's Institute of Politics. He taught a class at University of California, Los Angeles on protests from Port Huron to the present. Hayden taught a class in political science at the University of Southern California during the 1977‚Äì78 school year. He was the author or editor of 19 books, including The Long Sixties: From 1960 to Barack Obama, Writings for a Democratic Society: The Tom Hayden Reader, and his memoir, Reunion, and served on the editorial board of The Nation. His book Hell No: The Forgotten Power of the Vietnam Peace Movement, completed in the months before his death in October 2016, was published on January 31, 2017, by Yale University Press. During 2007, Akashic Books released Hayden's Ending the War in Iraq. In a discussion about the book with Theodore Hamm published in the Brooklyn Rail, Hayden argues, \\"The apparatus of occupation is never going to turn into a peacekeeping economic development agency. We need to withdraw our stamp of approval and our tax dollars from supporting the occupation. That doesn't mean that there can't be some attempts at remedies, but these should never be used as an excuse to stay.\\" Personal life He was married to actress and social activist Jane Fonda for 17 years, and was the father of actor Troy Garity. Hayden lived in Los Angeles from 1971 and was married to his third wife, Barbara Williams, at the time of his death. He and Williams adopted a son, Liam (born 2000). Hayden died in Santa Monica, California, on October 23, 2016, aged 76, following a lengthy illness, including a stroke.

George Dixon was \\"born in Leath Ward, a native of Kirkoswald\\". The son of Thomas Dixon, he was baptised in Kirkoswald on 8 July 1748. He served under Captain Cook in his third voyage, on , as armourer. In the course of the voyage he learned about the commercial possibilities along the North West Coast of America. History has not served Dixon well; for he is the least known of those who served and or were taught by Captain Cook and is only rarely mentioned in history books. When he is mentioned, he is relegated to a minor figure, overshadowed by the more dramatic figures of Cook and William Bligh, another officer on Cook's ill-fated third trip. In 1782, George Dixon was engaged by William Bolts. The ' newspaper of 29 June 1782 carried a report from Fiume that, \\"in the early days of this month, Mr. von Bolts, Director of the Triestine East India Company, together with the English captain, Mr. Digson, arrived in this city\\".see also ', ‚Ññ159, Thursday 4 July 1782 George Dixon wrote in the introduction to his account of the voyage he made for the Etches Company to the North West Coast in 1785‚Äì1788: > So early as 1781, William Bolts, Esq; fitted out the Cobenzell, an armed > ship of 700 tons, for the North-West Coast of America. She was to have > sailed from Trieste (accompanied by a tender of forty-five tons) under > Imperial colours, and was equally fitted out for trade or discovery: men of > eminence in every department of science were engaged on board; all the > maritime Courts of Europe were written to, in order to secure a good > reception for these vessels, at their respective ports, and favourable > answers were returned; yet, after all, this expedition, so exceedingly > promising in every point of view, was overcome by a set of interested men, > then in power in Vienna.George Dixon, A Voyage Round the World, London, > 1789, p.xx The Triestine Society sent the Cobenzell in September 1783 on a commercial voyage to the Malabar Coast and China by way of the Cape of Good Hope. After leaving Trieste, she proceeded to Marseilles, where she took in the principal part of her cargo and departed that port in December. Apparently, Bolts still wished to carry out his North West Coast venture in connection with this voyage, and asked George Dixon to participate.Robert J. King, \\"Heinrich Zimmermann and the Proposed Voyage of the Royal and Imperial Ship Cobenzell to the North West Coast in 1782‚Äì1783\\", The Northern Mariner/Le Marin du Nord, vol.21, no.3, July 2011, pp.235-262. However, Dixon went back to England, where he attempted to interest Sir Joseph Banks and English merchants in the North West Coast fur trade. This resulted in the formation of the Etches consortium, of which Dixon became a member with appointment as captain of the Queen Charlotte. The similarity is notable between the plan of the consortium and that elaborated by Bolts, which was apparently communicated to them by Dixon.Robert J. King, \\"William Bolts and the Austrian Origins of the Lap√©rouse Expedition\\", ', vol.40, 2008, pp.1‚Äì28 In 1785, Dixon became a partner in Richard Cadman Etches and Company, commonly called the King George's Sound Company to develop fur trade in present-day British Columbia and Alaska. In September 1785 Dixon and fellow trader Nathaniel Portlock sailed from England. Portlock was in command of the larger vessel, the 320-ton bm King George, with a crew of 59. Dixon commanded the 200 ton (bm) Queen Charlotte, with a crew of 33. Dixon and Portlock sailed together for most of their three-year voyage. Illustration of Oahu, from the French translation of Dixon's book A Voyage Round the World In the summers of 1786 and 1787, Dixon explored the shores of present-day British Columbia and southeastern Alaska. He spent the intervening winter in the Hawaiian Islands, where he became the first European to visit the island of Molokai. He anchored in Kealakekua Bay, where Cook had been killed, but did not come ashore. His chief areas of exploration were Haida Gwaii and Queen Charlotte Sound, Yakutat Bay (Port Mulgrave), Sitka Sound (Norfolk Bay), and the Dixon Entrance. While not the first European to explore the region of Haida Gwaii, he was the first to realize they were islands and not part of the mainland. On the northwestern part of Graham Island he acquired a large number of sea otter cloaks in trade with the Haida of Kiusta, under Chief Cuneah. Because of the many cloaks, he named the bay where he anchored \\"Cloak Bay\\". After visiting China and selling his cargo, he returned to England in 1788 and published, in 1789, A Voyage Round the World, but More Particularly to the North-West Coast of America.Dixon, (1789) The book was a collection of descriptive letters by William Beresford, his cargo officer, and valuable charts and appendices by Dixon. There was a controversy between Dixon and John Meares, another explorer who had published a book claiming credit for discoveries Dixon thought were made by others. This controversy resulted in three pamphlets by Dixon and Meares denouncing each other. In retrospect, history seems to support Dixon's view that Meares was dishonest. In 1789 Dixon met with Alexander Dalrymple, the Examiner of Sea Journals for the East India Company and an influential advocate of maritime exploration, and the Under- Secretary of the Home and Colonial Office, Evan Nepean. He urged on Nepean the need to take up Dalrymple‚Äôs plan for a settlement on the North West Coast to prevent the Russians, Americans or Spanish from establishing themselves there. Dixon was afraid that if nothing was done the coast and its trade would be lost to Britain.Dixon to Evan Nepean, 14 July 1789, National Archives, Kew, CO 42/72, ff.24‚Äì31 and at Public Archives of Canada, Ottawa, Q series, vol.49, p.354, printed in Report on Canadian Archives 1889, Ottawa, 1890, p. 29; cited in Barry M. Gough, \\"The Northwest Coast in Late 18th Century British Expansion\\", in Thomas Vaughan (ed.), The Western Shore, Portland, Oregon Historical Society and American Revolution Bicentennial Commission of Oregon, 1975, pp.48‚Äì80, p.67. On 20 October 1789, he wrote to Sir Joseph Banks regarding the expedition being fitted out under the command of his former shipmate, Henry Roberts, for discovery in the South Seas. He offered suggestions on the type of vessels that would be suitable and proposed the Queen Charlotte Islands as the best place to form a settlement on the North West Coast.Dixon to Sir Joseph Banks, 20 October 1789, reproduced in Richard H. Dillon, \\"Letters of Captain George Dixon in the Banks Collection\\", British Columbia Historical Quarterly, vol.XIV, no.3, 1950, pp.167‚Äì171. There was a George Dixon who taught navigation at Gosport, England and wrote a treatise entitled The Navigator's Assistant in 1791. This may or may not be the same George Dixon. Dixon arrived in Bermuda with his wife, Ann, via New York in February 1794. His intention was to revert to his original training and work as a silversmith/jeweller. This is borne out by an advertisement in The Bermuda Gazette in April 1794 announcing his intentions: \\"George Dixon, jeweller from London\\". The Bermuda Gazette soon reported that Dixon's wife Ann, \\"lately from England\\", died in childbirth in May 1794: she was buried at St George, Bermuda on 20 May 1794. Dixon was left with his only child, Marianna. He himself died shortly afterwards on 11 November 1795, as confirmed by a notice in the Cumberland Pacquet in February 1796: \\"[died] November 11 at Bermuda, Capt Dixon, the circumnavigator, a native of Kirkoswald in this county\\". The orphaned Marianna Dixon married a Bermudian merchant, Charles Bryan Hayward, in 1814.Duncan L.

The city-recognized Mira Mesa Community Plan Area is roughly bounded by Interstate 15 on the east, Interstate 805 on the west, the Los Pe√±asquitos Canyon on the north and Marine Corps Air Station Miramar on the south. Most of the community plan area is referred to as Mira Mesa; the community plan area also includes the neighborhoods of Sorrento Valley and Sorrento Mesa. The Mira Mesa neighborhood, as defined by the San Diego Police Department's neighborhood map, is roughly bounded by Interstate 15 to the east, Camino Santa Fe to the west, the Los Pe√±asquitos Canyon to the north and Marine Corps Air Station Miramar to the south.  History  file: Mira Mesa Land Use Map as defined by the San Diego City Council] https://www.sandiego.gov/planning/community/profiles/miramesa/plan Around the time of World War II the area now called Mira Mesa was used by the United States Army as a test area. Just west of U.S. Route 395 (now Interstate 15) was a Navy auxiliary landing field, known locally as Hourglass Field because the layout of the runways was a single piece of asphalt in the shape of an hourglass. The Navy also used the surrounding area as a bombing range. Starting in 1969 there was a housing boom in the area that now extends from the I-15 freeway in the east to I-805 in the west and is approximately 10,500 acres (42 km¬≤). This was one of the earliest areas of urban sprawl along the I-15 Corridor. Hourglass Field became the site of San Diego Miramar College and Hourglass Field Community Park. The area was built so quickly that it lacked schools, shopping centers, or other services for its thousands of residents. In 1971 Pete Wilson started his political career running for mayor with the slogan \\"No more Mira Mesas!\\" as a promise to stop quick, unplanned growth in San Diego. Since its inception, Mira Mesa was largely influenced by the military located at the adjacent NAS Miramar. Mira Mesa was the northernmost \\"real community\\" of San Diego, and was separated from the rest of the city by NAS Miramar for many years. For nearly 30 years the Navy's Top Gun School was located here, and most of the pilots made their homes in Mira Mesa. By the late 1990s, the Mira Mesa area had undergone extensive expansion to accommodate the thousands of new residents attracted by its proximity to major employers like UC San Diego, MCAS Miramar, Qualcomm, and dozens of biotech and pharmaceutical companies. Several commercial and industrial centers have been built within the Mira Mesa area. Mira Mesa has a significant concentration of Asian-American residents. Their presence has added to the diverse shopping available in Mira Mesa, including grocery and shops offered mainly by Filipino and Vietnamese people.  Economy  Established in the 1950s as a residential area to support Naval Air Station Miramar, Mira Mesa has grown into the largest community in San Diego. The community has business and residential zoned areas, providing shopping and recreational opportunities as well as business buildings with technology facilities and office space. It offers a variety of ethnic cuisines and restaurants, as well as more traditional dining. There are a total of twelve parks; two are community parks and ten are neighborhood parks. There are also teen and senior centers, an ice arena, an aquatic complex, multiple shopping centers, and a state-of-the-art movie theater.  Demographics  The community has about 80,000 residents, including students, hi-tech employees, families, and single people. There are over 23,000 homes in the community, averaging 3.09 people per household. The median age is 32.4 years. The 2010 census counted: Asian 44.3%, White (not Hispanic or Latino) 31.8%, Hispanic or Latino 13.6%, African American/Black 4.8%, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander 0.8%, and Native American 0.5%.  Transportation  Sorrento Valley Station which serves the Mira Mesa area. Public transportation is provided by the San Diego Transit and the Metropolitan Transit System, through buses and DART (Direct Access to Regional Transit) shuttles. A train station serves Mira Mesa in Sorrento Valley and is served by the Coaster commuter train, of the North County transit district. The Coaster links Mira Mesa to Downtown San Diego, and north to coastal communities like Solana Beach and Oceanside. Main highways include Interstates 805 and 15.  Main Thoroughfares  * Mira Mesa Boulevard runs east to west, and is the main road through Mira Mesa. It is an important link between Interstates 15 and 805. Before the completion of State Route 56, which runs parallel to and north of Mira Mesa Boulevard, the street carried a heavy volume of traffic and was considered one of the most congested streets in the city. * Camino Ruiz is a north-south four-lane thoroughfare that runs the whole length of the Mira Mesa area, and links Miramar Road to Mira Mesa Boulevard, to Calle Cristobal. It is a main thoroughfare for military personnel traveling to and from MCAS Miramar and the surrounding area. * Camino Santa Fe is a north-south four-lane thoroughfare that runs the whole length of the Mira Mesa area, and links Miramar Road to Mira Mesa Boulevard, to Calle Cristobal/Sorrento Valley Boulevard. * Black Mountain Road is a north-south thoroughfare that connects the more southerly portions of San Diego to Mira Mesa, and continues on to Rancho Pe√±asquitos and Del Mar. * Calle Cristobal runs east to west, along the northern perimeter of Mira Mesa, through the Los Pe√±asquitos Canyon. * Sorrento Valley Boulevard becomes Calle Cristobal at its intersection with Camino Santa Fe.Mira Mesa Community Plan, City of San Diego  Sports  * The Mira Mesa Youth Baseball League (MMYB) serves boys and girls age 4-16, and is operated entirely by volunteer parents.

Murga groups also operate in the Buenos Aires Carnival, though to a lesser extent than in Montevideo; the Argentine murga is more centred on dancing and less on vocals than the Uruguayan one. Uruguayan murga has a counterpart in Cadiz, Spain from which it is derived, the chirigota, but over time the two have diverged into distinct forms. A murga performance features up to 17 performers, usually men. In the period preceding Carnival, which takes place from late January to early March in Uruguay, each group will prepare a musical play consisting of a suite of songs and recitative (heightened speech) lasting around 45 minutes. This suite will be performed on community stages known as tablados, set up in Montevideo's various neighbourhoods, throughout the Carnival period. Groups also vie against one another in a prestigious official competition. Lyrical content is based on a particular theme, chosen by the group, which serves to provide commentary on events in Uruguay or elsewhere over the preceding year. Consequently, murga lends itself well to being used as a form of popular resistance. For example, during the dictatorship in Uruguay in the 1970s, groups like became known for their left-wing tendencies, subversive commentary and oppositional stance. A traditional murga group is composed of a chorus and three percussionists and this is the type of murga performed on stages at Carnival. The singers perform in polyphony using up to five vocal parts. Vocal production tends to be nasal and loud with little variation in volume. The percussion instruments, derived from the European military band, are bombo (a shallow bass drum worn at the waist and played horizontally), redoblante (snare drum) and platillos (clash cymbals). The two most important pieces of the performance are the opening song (saludo) and the exit song (retirada or despedida). These get played on the radio during the Carnival period and some of them, such as the Saludo Araca La Cana 1937, are cherished by Uruguayans as cultural icons. Murguistas dress in elaborate, colourful, jester-like costumes. Staging is sparse with minimal use of props. The singers tend to be foregrounded with the percussionists at the back or off to the side of the stage. The musical style or rhythmic structures of the murga is sometimes incorporated into Uruguayan popular music. Examples of artists who have included murga in their arrangements are Jaime Roos, Rub√©n Rada, No Te Va Gustar, M√°ximo Diego Pujol , and Alejandro Balbis. It has also been incorporated by some Argentine artists, such as Bersuit Vergarabat, Los Aut√©nticos Decadentes, and Los Fabulosos Cadillacs. A very famous song involving a Murga is the song El Matador by Los Fabulosos Cadillacs. It also incorporates the use of a whistle, a very common element in the Argentine Murga.

History The mid-engine, rear-wheel drive format can be considered the original layout of automobiles. A 1901 Autocar was the first gasoline-powered automobile to use a drive shaft and placed the engine under the seat. This pioneering vehicle is now in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution. Benefits The Lotus Europa S1 was based on a prototype built to compete for Henry Ford II's contract to build a Le Mans race car in the early 1960s. Mounting the engine in the middle instead of the front of the vehicle puts more weight over the rear tires, so they have more traction and provide more assistance to the front tires in braking the vehicle, with less chance of rear-wheel lockup and less chance of a skid or spin out. If the mid-engine vehicle is also rear-drive the added weight on the rear tires can also improve acceleration on slippery surfaces, providing much of the benefit of all wheel drive without the added weight and expense of all wheel drive components. The mid-engine layout makes ABS brakes and traction control systems work better, by providing them more traction to control. The mid-engine layout may make a vehicle safer, since an accident can occur if a vehicle cannot stay in its own lane around a curve or is unable to stop quickly enough. Mid-engine design is also a way to provide additional empty crush space in the front of the automobile between the bumper and the windshield, which can then be used in a frontal collision to absorb more of the impact force to minimize penetration into the passenger compartment of the vehicle. In most automobiles, and in sports cars especially, ideal car handling requires balanced traction between the front and rear wheels when cornering, in order to maximize the possible speed around curves without sliding out. This balance is harder to achieve when the heavy weight of the engine is located far to the front or far to the rear of the vehicle. Some automobile designs strive to balance the fore and aft weight distribution by other means, such as putting the engine in the front and the transmission and battery in the rear of the vehicle. Another benefit comes when the heavy mass of the engine is located close to the back of the seats. It makes it easier for the suspension to absorb the force of bumps so the riders feel a smoother ride. But in sports cars the engine position is once again used to increase performance and the potentially smoother ride is usually more than offset by stiffer shock absorbers. This layout also allows the transmission and motor to be directly bolted to each other--with independent suspension on the driven wheels; this removes the need for the chassis to transfer engine torque reaction. Drawbacks Underfloor mid-engine in a historical Hanomag truck chassis. The largest drawback of mid- engine cars is restricted rear passenger space; consequently most mid-engine vehicles are two-seat vehicles. The engine in effect pushes the passenger compartment forward towards the front axle (if engine is behind driver). Exceptions typically involve larger vehicles of unusual length or height in which the passengers can share space between the axles with the engine, which can be between them or below them, as in some Toyota vans, large trucks and buses. The mid-engine layout (with a horizontal engine) was common in single- decker buses in the 1950s and 1960s, e.g. the AEC Reliance. The Ferrari Mondial is to date the only successful example of a true mid-engined convertible with seating for 4 and sports car / supercar performance. A version of the Lotus Evora with a removable roof panel is anticipated but no definite date is known. Like any layout where the engine is not front-mounted and facing the wind, the traditional \\"engine-behind-the-passengers\\" layout makes engine cooling more difficult. This has been a problem in some cars, but this issue seems to have been largely solved in newer designs. For example, the Saleen S7 employs large engine-compartment vents on the sides and rear of the bodywork to help dissipate heat from its very high-output engine. Mid engined cars are more dangerous than front-engined cars if the driver loses control - although this may be initially harder to provoke due to the superior balance - and the car begins to spin. The moment of inertia about the center of gravity is low due to the concentration of mass between the axles (similar to standing in the middle of a playground roundabout, rather than at the edge) and the spin will occur suddenly, the car will rotate faster and it will be harder to recover from. Conversely, a front-engined car is more likely to break away in a progressive and controllable manner as the tires lose traction. Variations Super, sport and race cars frequently have a mid- engined layout, as these vehicles' handling characteristics are more important than other requirements, such as usable space. In dedicated sports cars, a weight distribution of about 50% front and rear is frequently pursued, to optimise the vehicle's driving dynamics ‚Äì a target that is typically only achievable by placing the engine somewhere between the front and rear axles. Usually, the term \\"mid-engine\\" has been primarily applied to cars having the engine located between the driver and the rear drive axles. This layout is referred to as rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive, (or RMR) layout. The mechanical layout and packaging of an RMR car is substantially different from that of a front-engine or rear-engine car. When the engine is in front of the driver, but fully behind the front axle line, the layout is sometimes called a front mid-engine, rear drive, or FMR layout instead of the less-specific term front-engine; and can be considered a subset of the latter. In vehicle layout FMR is substantially the same as FR, but handling differs as a result of the difference in weight distribution. Some vehicles could be classified as FR or FMR depending on the factory installed engine (I4 vs I6). Historically most classical FR cars such as the Ford Models T and A would qualify as a FMR engine car. Additionally, the distinction between FR and FMR is a fluid one, depending on the degree of engine protrusion in front of the front axle line, as manufacturers mount engines as far back in the chassis as possible. Not all manufacturers use the Front-Mid designation. Examples =FMR layout ‚Äì Front Mid-engine / Rear-wheel drive= Front mid-engine position / Rear-wheel drive Front mid-engine position / Rear-wheel drive These cars are RWD cars with engine placed between driver and front axle. * Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione * Chevrolet Corvette (second through seventh generations) * Bill Thomas Cheetah (used only one universal joint between transmission tailshaft housing and differential housing) * Dodge/SRT Viper * 599 GTB Fiorano, 612 Scaglietti, F12 Berlinetta and GTC4Lusso T * Honda S2000 *Jaguar E-Type * Lexus LFA * Maserati Quattroporte V, GranTurismo/GranCabrio * Mazda RX-7, MX-5 (second to fourth generations) and RX-8 * Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren and SLS AMG and AMG GT * Opel GT (First generation only) * Toyota Previa and 2000GT * Shelby Daytona * Most pre-World War II front engine rear wheel drive cars =FM4 layout ‚Äì Front Mid-engine / Four-wheel drive= This layout, similar to above FMR layout, with engine between driver and behind front axle, adds front wheel drive to become a four-wheel drive. An engineering challenge with this layout is getting the power to the front wheels past the engine - this would normally involve raising the engine to allow a propshaft to pass under the engine, or in the case of the Ferrari FF taking power from both ends of the crankshaft with two separate gearboxes. *Ferrari FF/GTC4Lusso *Hummer H1 *Toyota Previa All-Trac variant *Toyota Van 4WD variant (first generation) =RMR layout ‚Äì Rear Mid-engine / Rear-wheel drive= Rear mid-engine position / Rear-wheel drive These cars use traditional engine layout between driver and rear drive axle.

Local Jazz singer Jane Harvey Brown leads the way as grand marshal for a brass band at a second line in the French Quarter in New Orleans. \\"Sons of Hope and the Annual Parade of the Young Veterans\\", New Orleans c. 1902 Exuberant dancing in the streets and sidewalks is part of the second line experience. The Second Line is a tradition in parades organized by Social, Aid and Pleasure Clubs (SAPCs) with a brass band parades in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. The \\"main line\\" or \\"first line\\" is the main section of the parade, or the members of the SAPC with the parading permit as well as the brass band. The Second Line consists of people who follow the band to enjoy the music, dance, and engage in \\"community.\\" The Second Line's style of traditional dance, in which participants dance and walk along with the SAPCs in an African-based, free-form style with parasols and handkerchiefs, is called \\"second-lining\\". It is one of the most African- retentive cultures in the United States. It has been called \\"the quintessential New Orleans art form ‚Äì a jazz funeral without a body\\". Another significant difference from jazz funerals is that Second Line parades lack the slow hymns and dirges played at funerals (although some organizations may have the band play a solemn selection toward the start of the parade in memory of members who died since their last parade). Origins The Second Line has its origins in traditional West African circle or ring dances. The Second Line tradition was brought to New Orleans by enslaved Africans, where it became a ritual for Africans in America, especially in various processions, including funerals. Some scholars believe that the West African ring featured children drumming with adults dancing that in turn, forced the ring to straighten into a line. Others note the similarity of the steps ‚Äì exaggerated, stylistic strutting ‚Äì to dances performed in Congo Square by the enslaved given the day off on Sundays. These dances were officially banned for a time because they were deemed threatening to the white inhabitants of the city, and their resurgence in the Second Line culture suggests a similar celebration of individual freedom. African and African-American traditions continued throughout the \\"Code Noir\\" and Jim Crow eras in New Orleans. so African- Americans formed Benevolent Societies and \\"Social, Aid & Pleasure Clubs\\" because white Insurance companies often refused to cover free people of color and/or the formerly enslaved. SAPCs assisted members through illness and supported families with burial costs for deceased members. This is a carry- over from African traditions that believed in celebrating the member's spirit leaving the body to return to the ancestors and God. This led to what became known as a \\"jazz funeral\\", with the SAPC members marching in a dirge with a brass band before the deceased body being \\"cut loose\\" and a celebratory parade begins. The same club exercised their social aspect with a colorful, annual, public Second Line parade through their home community. Second line drumming A second line snare drummer commonly follows the brass band, playing off of the marching beat with improvised polyrhythmic figures that can inspire second line dancers or, if the band is improvising, the band itself. Second line drumming styles became a feature of early jazz drumming and the New Orleans Rhythm and Blues of the 1950s. The Rebirth Brass Band and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band feature traditional second line drumming styles. Drummers such as Billy Higgins and Idris Muhammad adapted second line drum figures to modern jazz. Modern second lining Second line parades are part of the cultural heritage of New Orleans. The locally best known second line parades are held by clubs and benevolent organizations. Some have long histories; the oldest such organization still holding regular parades is the Young Men Olympian Junior Benevolent Association, founded in 1884. During the \\"second line season\\", lasting most of the year with breaks for holidays (including Mardi Gras) and the hottest part of summer, there are second line parades most Sundays. Longer parades often make stops, commonly at bars, where refreshments have been arranged for members and those following the parade for fun can purchase something. There are often vendors selling soft drinks, beer, and street food, including barbecue and yaka mein. Additional second lines, large or small, may be held for any event which people think merits hiring a parading band for such a style of celebration, including weddings and opening of businesses. The historic predominantly African-American neighborhoods of Trem√© and Central City are most strongly associated with the traditions, though second lines can often be seen in the Seventh Ward, Uptown, Marigny, Ninth Ward, Mid-City, and at least on occasion in most of the older neighborhoods of the city. The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival holds second lines at the Fair Grounds each day of the festival to give visitors a taste of this New Orleans tradition. A Second Line parade was featured in the 1973 James Bond film Live and Let Die. In 2010, the opening scene in the pilot episode, as well as the season one finale of the HBO series Trem√© featured a Second Line paradeList of Treme episodes#Season 1 .282010.29 and journalists championed second line culture. The Second Line culture has maintained a dedicated, organized schedule throughout the history of SAPCs in New Orleans with clubs enjoying annual parades on their selected dates with those events contributing to the local economy. The clubs never lost their African-based traditions and mores and immediately restored their scheduled parades as soon as New Orleans reopened to its citizens after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. The Black Men of Labor held the first SAPC Second Line parade in October 2005. New residents of New Orleans embraced the Second Line tradition and parade routes were publicized online inviting outsiders to participate. Second Line parades have been taking place since the late 1800s and with innumerable SAPC events and jazz funerals, the sheer number of events with thousands of people since that time have been lively, fun and memorable - taking place without incident. Violence has marred some parades in recent years, including the May 12, 2013 Mother's Day Parade shooting where 19 were wounded and one was trampled.

Claims of Spain The claims of Spain dated back nearly 300 years to the papal bull of 1493 that, along with the following Treaty of Tordesillas, defined and delineated a zone of Spanish rights exclusive of Portugal. In relation to other states the agreement was legally ineffective (res inter alios acta). Spain interpreted it in the widest possible sense, deducing that it gave them full sovereignty. Other European powers did not recognize the Inter caetera, and even Spain and Portugal only adhered to it when it was useful and convenient. Britain's claims to the region were dated back to the voyage of Sir Francis Drake in 1579, and also by right of prior discovery by Captain James Cook in 1778, although the Spanish had explored and claimed the region in 1774, under Juan P√©rez, and in 1775, under Bruno de Heceta and Bodega y Quadra. Disputed sovereignty The Nootka Sound dispute began in 1789 when Spain sent Jos√© Mart√≠nez to occupy Nootka Sound and establish exclusive Spanish sovereignty. During the summer of 1789 a number of fur trading vessels, British and American, arrived at Nootka. A conflict over sovereignty arose between the captain of the British Argonaut, James Colnett, and Mart√≠nez. By the end of the summer Mart√≠nez had arrested Colnett, seized several British ships, and arrested their crews. Colnett had come to Nootka Sound intending to build a permanent trading post and colony on land previously acquired by his business associate John Meares. At the end of the summer Mart√≠nez abandoned Nootka and took the captured ships and prisoners to San Blas, New Spain. The news about these events triggered a confrontation between Spain and Britain known as the Nootka Crisis, which nearly led to war. Nootka Conventions The Nootka Conventions of the 1790s, carried out in part by George Vancouver and his Spanish counterpart Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra, prevented the dispute from escalating to war. The first Convention was signed on October 28, 1790.Pethick, Derek, The Nootka Connection, p. 260, Vancouver, Douglas & McIntyre, 1980 and was purposefully vague. Its preamble contained the statement, \\"setting aside all retrospective discussions of the rights and pretensions of the two parties...\\". Its first article said that all \\"the buildings and tracts of land\\" at Nootka Sound that had been seized by Mart√≠nez would be restored to Britain. For this purpose Vancouver and Bodega y Quadra were sent to Nootka Sound in 1792. However, no buildings had been seized and Bodega said no land had been acquired by the British, as attested by the indigenous chief Maquinna as well as the American traders Robert Gray and Joseph Ingraham, who were present in 1789. Vancouver was unwilling to accept Bodega's various counter-offers and the whole matter was sent back to the British and Spanish governments.Robert J. King, ‚ÄúGeorge Vancouver and the contemplated settlement at Nootka Sound‚Äù, The Great Circle, vol.32, no.1, 2010, pp.6-34; At the Far Reaches of Empire, p. 263 = First Nootka Convention = The first Nootka Convention plays a role in the disputed sovereignty of the Falkland Islands between the United Kingdom and Argentina. Article VI provided that neither party would form new establishments on any of the islands adjacent to the east and west coasts of South America then occupied by Spain. Both retained the right to land and erect temporary structures on the coasts and islands for fishery-related purposes. However, there was an additional secret article that stipulated that Article VI shall remain in force only so long as no establishment shall have been formed by the subjects of any other power on the coasts in question. This secret article had the same force as if it were inserted in the convention. The Nootka Convention's applicability to the Falklands dispute is controversial and complicated. The United Provinces of the River Plate was not a party to the convention. Therefore, it is defined in the convention as 'other power' and the occupation of the settlement (at Port Louis) by subjects of any other power negated Article VI and allowed Great Britain to re-assert prior sovereignty and form new settlements.See, for example, ; and = Second Nootka Convention = The second Nootka Convention, known as the Nootka Claims Convention, was signed in February 1793 and awarded compensation to John Meares for the Spanish seizure of his ships at Nootka in 1789.Pethick, Derek, The Nootka Connection, p. 266, Vancouver, Douglas & McIntyre, 1980 = Third Nootka Convention = The third Nootka Convention, also known as the Convention for the Mutual Abandonment of Nootka, was signed on January 11, 1794.Pethick, Derek, The Nootka Connection, p. 268, Vancouver, Douglas & McIntyre, 1980 It called for the mutual abandonment of Nootka Sound. Britain and Spain were both free to use Nootka Sound as a port and erect temporary structures, but, \\"neither ... shall form any permanent establishment in the said port or claim any right of sovereignty or territorial dominion there to the exclusion of the other. And Their said Majesties will mutually aid each other to maintain for their subjects free access to the port of Nootka against any other nation which may attempt to establish there any sovereignty or dominion\\".Carlos Calvo, Recueil complet des trait√©s, conventions, capitulations, armistices et autres actes diplomatiques de tous les √©tats de l'Am√©rique latine, Tome IIIe, Paris, Durand, 1862, pp.366-368. Unresolved borders Although the Nootka Crisis originally revolved around the issue of sovereignty and the northern limits of New Spain, the basic issues were left unresolved. Both sides took up positions regarding the border, with Britain desiring it set just north of San Francisco and Spain at the Strait of Juan de Fuca. After Vancouver rejected Bodega's proposal of the Strait of Juan de Fuca the border question was not again addressed and instead left unspecified. The third convention addressed the issue of sovereignty only for the port of Nootka Sound itself. U.S. claims The fledgling United States had no claim in this area at the time of the first Nootka Convention. US claims in the region began with Robert Gray's Columbia River expedition. They were strengthened and enlarged by the Lewis and Clark Expedition and the establishment of Fort Astoria by the Pacific Fur Company. The Spanish claims to the Pacific Northwest were acquired by the United States by the Adams-On√≠s Treaty, signed in 1819. The United States argued that it had acquired a right of exclusive sovereignty from Spain. This position led to a dispute with Britain known as the Oregon boundary dispute. This dispute was not resolved until the signing of the Oregon Treaty in 1846, which divided the disputed territory and established what later became the international boundary between Canada and the United States. Although the Nootka Conventions theoretically opened the Pacific Northwest coast from northern California to Alaska to British colonization, the advent of the Napoleonic Wars distracted any efforts towards this (as recommended by Vancouver at the time) and the proposed settlement colony in the region was to be abandoned. The Hudson's Bay Company, the remaining British presence in the region, was averse to settlement and any economic activity other than its own, such that settlement and resource development did not take place to any degree until the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858, which formalized British claims on the mainland still residual from the Nootka Conventions into the Colony of British Columbia.

His music was influenced by many different styles including rock, electronic, punk and ra√Ø. Early life Taha was born in 1958 in Sig (Mascara Province), Algeria, although a second source suggests he was born in the Algerian seacoast city of Oran. This town was the \\"birthplace of ra√Ø\\" music, and 1958 was a key year in the Algerian struggle for independence against French authority. He began listening to Algerian music in the 1960s, including street-style music called chaabi. Additionally, music from the Maghreb region was part of his upbringing. He moved with his parents to France when he was ten years old, settling in an immigrant community around the French city of Lyon in 1968.Plastino, pp. 111.

The Independent. 6 November 2009. Retrieved 8 November 2009. Career =Ra√Ø roots= Taha grew up in the seaside Algerian city of Oran. In the 1980s, Algeria's indigenous pop music known as ra√Ø began to achieve international attention. Originally ra√Ø music was based on \\"city slickers adapting music from the sticks\\" and was described as ribald, but it became more of a medium for political protest when young people in the 1960s and 1970s used it to \\"express their anger and desires.\\" Taha suggested that Algerian musical styles and rock are \\"closely linked\\". Taha was influenced by the North African cha√¢bi band Nass El Ghiwane which has been described as \\"Morocco's answer to the Beatles or the Stones.\\" =Carte de S√©jour= In 1981, while living in Lyon, Taha met Mohammed and Mokhtar Amini and the three of them, along with Djamel Dif and Eric Vaquer would soon form a band. In 1982, Taha was the lead vocalist for the Arab-language rock group which they named Carte de Sejour, meaning Green Card or Residence Permit depending on the translation. He sang in both English and Arabic, but usually in Arabic. Taha was inspired by the group The Clash: Taha met members of the group The Clash in Paris: Clash singer Joe Strummer Taha believed his early recordings helped to inspire The Clash to create the song \\"Rock the Casbah\\". A New York Times music reporter wrote of Taha's cover version of the Clash's hit song probably influenced by his earlier work: These were difficult years since record stores often refused to stock their records \\"because they didn't want Arabs coming into their shops\\". There was little money; the band performed in suburbs of Lyon. Taha took a standard patriotic French song entitled \\"Sweet France\\" (in French: Douce France) which had originally been recorded by Charles Trenet in the 1940s, kept the lyrics, but sang it with \\"furious irony\\" which irritated many French listeners, particularly coming from a \\"scruffy, bohemian-looking Arabic singer\\", to the point where Taha's version was banned from French radio. The \\"acerbic\\" song created a \\"splash\\", nevertheless, and won Taha some recognition as a serious artist. The group never achieved much commercial success and, as a result, Taha had to work a series of day jobs in a factory, then as a house painter, a dishwasher, and later as an encyclopedia salesman. They recorded their first maxi album Carte De S√©jour in 1983. In 1984, with the help of British guitarist Steve Hillage, the group achieved a \\"sharp, driving sound\\" which played well on the radio, and the LP was entitled Rhoromanie. In his songwriting, Taha wrote about living in exile and the cultural strife associated with being an Algerian immigrant in France. In 1986, his \\"sneering punk-rock cover of 'Douce France'\\" was seen as an \\"unmistakable protest against the nation's treatment of its immigrant underclass\\", and caused consternation in French political circles. His song \\"Voil√†, Voil√†\\" protested racism. Taha had to cope with anti-Arab sentiment and confusion; for example, The New York Times stated in a front-page story that Taha was Egyptian rather than Algerian, but later posted a correction. Later, in 2007, Taha-as-an-immigrant was mentioned in France's National Center of the History of Immigration. Taha performing in Belgium When performing live, Taha wore various outfits, including at one point a leather fedora hat, then later a red cowboy hat. The band's second and last LP entitled Ramsa (Five) was released in 1986. The band dissolved in 1989. =Solo years= In 1989, Taha moved to Paris to launch his solo career. At one point he was invited to Los Angeles to record with musician Don Was, who had been a producer associated with the Rolling Stones. Taha mixed a variety of instruments and styles for his sound. With a drum instrument called a doumbek or darbuka, his new group played Arabic-style beats. It appeared at one point that Taha might become an \\"overnight success\\", but after the release of the album Barb√®s, sales were disappointing in the United States, possibly because Americans were not keen on Arabic-sounding music during the time of the first Gulf War. In 1993, Taha again worked with Hillage who helped produce his second solo album, the self- titled Rachid Taha and helped him achieve \\"the kind of clubland-ra√Ø synthesis\\". Hillage worked on three solo Taha albums from 1993 to 2001, helping Taha return to his \\"north African roots\\". In 1995, he released the album entitled Ol√© Ol√© with Taha looking like an \\"Aryan androgyne\\" with dyed blond hair and blue contact lenses, to make a point about anti-Arab bigotry and at the \\"homophobia of North African culture.\\" Valencia features the singing of Kirsty Hawkshaw. In 1997, his song \\"Ya Rayah\\" became a hit. He performed in the Canary Islands. In 2001, Taha released Made in Medina, and a music critic commented that he used a \\"full and varied instrumental palette\\" along with \\"a dizzying vocal facility that transcends whatever style he's plugged.\\" The album was recorded in Paris, New Orleans, and London with input from the American jam band Galactic. Taha saw parallels between African and American music and said \\"New Orleans is like Algiers ... They were both French colonies at one time, and there's even an area there called Algiers,\\" and he noted that Louisiana Zydeco drum patterns were similar to ra√Ø music. Made in Medina combined Algerian roots, techno, pop music, and early rock and punk influences with \\"remarkable consistency\\" with previous works, according to Hillage. There were elements of political protest in his music leading a BBC critic to describe him as a \\"shit-disturbing artist who risks challenging his own culture as undemocratic.\\" He wanted to record in New Orleans \\"because I see parallels between African and American music, and between the music of the African slaves who came to New Orleans, and that of the Gnawas, the black desert tribes who became slaves of the Arabs in North Africa. And New Orleans is like Algiers. They were both French colonies at one time, and there's even an area there called Algiers.\\" He was delighted to find that some of the local Louisiana Zydeco drum patterns are remarkably similar to ra√Ø. A report in The Guardian suggested that Taha had achieved a cult status in pop music. Guitarist Steve Hillage played a big role in Taha's career, primarily as a producer. Taha's breakthrough album as a solo artist was his bestseller Diw√¢n, featuring remakes of songs from Algerian and Arab traditions. The album featured traditional instruments like the oud but with a \\"contemporary veneer of programmed percussion and samples added in.\\" Taha mixed the oud with strings using a contemporary beat along with guitar work, according to one account. Taha's album T√©kitoi, produced by Steve Hillage and released in 2004, brought acclaim and recognition from other rock musicians. The title track is \\"street slang\\" meaning, roughly, Who the Hell Are You? (from the French Tu es qui, toi ? shortened into T'es qui, toi ?) and the music had \\"echoes of Joe Strummer\\", according to a review in The Observer. In 2005 Taha performed with Robert Plant, Patti Smith and Brian Eno. He covered The Clash song \\"Rock the Casbah\\" which he retitled with the Arabic name of \\"Rock El Casbah\\". This song appeared in the 2007 film about Clash frontman Joe Strummer entitled The Future Is Unwritten. The song suggested rock music as \\"banned but unstoppable\\". Taha performed the song along with The Clash musician Mick Jones. The Guardian selected \\"Rock El Casbah\\" as one of the top 50 cover songs. Taha played in Morocco in 2006. In 2007, Taha performed in Canada and a reporter from the Montreal Gazette described his performance while wearing a \\"pewter pimp suit\\" which was \\"stunning\\": mandole or mandolute, played by a member of Mon c√¥t√© punk. In 2008 he performed with the band Dengue Fever. He was described as a \\"\\"wild Algerian punk fan\\" performing among a lineup which read like a \\"Who's Who of West African music\\", and was part of \\"Africa Express\\", a response to the lack of African musicians at Bob Geldof's Live 8 musical extravaganza. In 2008, Taha was growing increasingly prominent, with greater audiences in places such as Canada, although there were reports that his music had \\"trouble getting airplay\\" in France. He performed with Nigerian artists Femi Kuti and Seun Kuti in Lagos at a \\"Felabration\\" of the music of their late father Fela Kuti, as well as with Brian Eno in an anti-war concert in London. In 2009, Taha released Bonjour which The Guardian music critic Robin Denselow described as \\"calmed down\\" under a new producer, Ga√´tan Roussel. Denselow wrote: \\"The result is an unlikely set in which Taha appears to be deliberately courting a new, wider market by playing down that wild rebel image.\\" Denselow felt the music was more \\"commercial\\" and \\"not his most exciting.\\" It included a \\"rousing tribute\\" on his cover song Rock El Casbah to the late Clash guitarist Joe Strummer. In 2010, Taha played in Toronto, Canada to large audiences. Taha performed with Algerian artist Mehdi Haddab who plays the oud. Taha's song \\"Habina\\" was featured in the 2010 film, It's Kind of a Funny Story. Guitarist Carlos Santana recorded his song Migra which went on to sell over 25 million copies. In recent years, Taha toured nations including the United States and Dubai. In 2013 Taha released the Zoom album, which was produced by guitarist Justin Adams and featured guests Mick Jones and Brian Eno;. Jones toured with Taha as part of the Zoom project. The album included a new recording of \\"Voil√†, Voil√†\\". Taha also recorded \\"Now or Never\\" (words and music by Aaron Schroeder / Wally Gold and previously recorded by Elvis Presley), which features Jeanne Added singing in English. =Use of Taha's songs in movies and computer games= The song Barra Barra from his album Made in Medina was featured in the 2001 film Black Hawk Down as well as in the Games Convention 2008 trailer of the game Far Cry 2. It was also featured in the 2007 film The Hunting Party. His song \\"Garab\\" from Made in Medina was used in the movie The Truth About Charlie in 2002, and also in Blood and Chocolate in 2007. His song Ya Rayah from His album Carte Blanche (Rachid Taha album) was used in the movie Something New (film) (2006) =Reviews= Some critics attribute Taha's unique sound to his use of the mandolute, a mixture of the traditional oud with European fretted instruments. One critic described his arrangements as \\"no less bombastic\\" since they mixed North African rhythms and \\"string orchestra flourishes\\" with \\"pummeling big-beat techno, distorted electric guitars, snatches of Bo Diddley, Led Zeppelin and other macho sounds.\\" * Music critic Philip Brasor in Japan Times commented that Taha's album Made in Medina featured Arabic \\"chanting\\" which was meant to evoke \\"the generalized chaos of society\\" and which features \\"heart-stopping break beats, flamenco guitar, African choruses, crunching hard rock and the inevitable sappy love song.\\" * Music critic Robin Denselow felt Taha's Bonjour album was calm ‚Äì \\"he switches between Arabic and French in this mix of pleasant ballads and novelty pop, with just the occasional reminder of the old passion and anger.\\" Denselow felt his album T√©kitoi (2004) was his \\"most powerful, direct fusion of rock and North African styles to date.\\" Denselow wrote: * The New York Times wrote about Taha's song \\"Ah Mon Amour\\": * BBC News music critic Martin Vennard described Taha's music as a \\"seductive mixture of traditional North African, rock, techno and dance music.\\" * Canadian music critic Philly Markowitz named a Taha album one of the best in 2005. * French music critic Amobe Mevegue described Taha as an \\"eclectic artist\\". = Discography and filmography = Personal life and death Taha was described as \\"gregarious\\" and \\"quick with a smile.\\" A person who liked to party throughout the night, he also had a cosmopolitan group of friends. Taha was quoted as saying \\"I've never wanted to just stay in my own neighborhood, my own community ... It's a kind of conformism. You have to be adventurous.\\" Taha was not fond of contemporary French cinema and said \\"I'd much rather watch some dumb Hollywood movie than another haute bourgeois auteurist piece of crap.\\" He was a critic of the Bush administration although he made comments favoring a bombing raid on Iran, and said that \\"Iran shouldn't be allowed to have nukes.\\" Taha suffered from Chiari malformation diagnosed in 1987. \\"I'm tired of people thinking I'm a drunk on stage. While these are the symptoms of Arnold Chiari disease. I'm stumbling because I'm losing my balance. I'm wavering. It generates a disruption in the body.\\" Taha died from a heart attack in his sleep on 12 September 2018, six days before his 60th birthday.Le Monde: Mort du chanteur Rachid Taha, l√©gende du m√©tissage musical He is survived by his longtime partner V√©ronique Pr√© and their son, Lyes..

It includes residential areas and commercial and light industrial districts. Most residents live on the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar (formerly Naval Air Station Miramar). Miramar was the site of the real Top Gun made famous by the movie Top Gun in 1986. NAS Miramar was realigned by the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) program in 1995 and turned over to the Marine Corps as a fixed wing and helicopter base in 1999. To the north of MCAS Miramar is the suburb of Mira Mesa. The neighborhood is located in City Council District 7 and is represented by Council member Scott Sherman.  History  Miramar was originally part of Scripps Ranch, founded by Edward W. Scripps. He named the home he built on the ranch Miramar in the 1890s, after Archduke Maximilian's castle Miramare in Trieste, Italy. The name eventually became applied to the surrounding mesa. Loosely translated from Italian or Spanish, it means \\"a view of the sea\\". Before becoming a military base in 1950, Miramar was a small, isolated community centered on a railroad station. No buildings from the original Miramar survived. Overtime, a Little India commercial community developed on Black Mountain Road.  Economy  The Miramar submarket consists of approximately 14 million square feet of distribution, warehouse, office, and Miramar Road frontage retail related space. Miramar is one of San Diego County's most recognized real estate markets due in part to its central location, size, and traditional industrial characteristics. This market historically maintains one of the highest occupancy rates in the county. Recent occupancy rates were approximately 91%.Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar (1995), a part of the Miramar air station See also * Ruby Peters Miramar before the planes: of the U.S. Naval Air Station at San Diego, California; a rural settlement and one room school 1890-1950.

NTM do cause pulmonary diseases that resemble tuberculosis. Mycobacteriosis is any of these illnesses, usually meant to exclude tuberculosis. They occur in many animals, including humans. Introduction Mycobacteria are a family of small, rod-shaped bacilli that can be classified into three main groups for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment: * Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, which can cause tuberculosis: M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. africanum, M. microti and M. canetti * M. leprae and M. lepromatosis, which cause Hansen's disease, also called leprosy * Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are all the other mycobacteria that can cause pulmonary disease resembling tuberculosis, lymphadenitis, skin disease, or disseminated disease. Although over 150 different species of NTM have been described, pulmonary infections are most commonly due to Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), Mycobacterium kansasii, and Mycobacterium abscessus (see image). Taxonomy In 1959, botanist Ernest Runyon put these human disease- associated bacteria into four groups (Runyon classification):Grange, J. M. (2007). \\"Environmental mycobacteria\\". In Greenwood, David; Slack, Richard; Peitherer, John; & Barer, Mike (Eds.), Medical Microbiology (17th ed.), pp. 221‚Äì227. Elsevier. , p. 221 *Photochromogens develop pigments in or after being exposed to light. Examples include M. kansasii, M. simiae, and M. marinum. *Scotochromogens become pigmented in darkness. Examples include M. scrofulaceum and M. szulgai. *Nonchromogens include a group of prevalent opportunistic pathogens called M. avium complex (MAC). Other examples are M. ulcerans, M. xenopi, M. malmoense, M. terrae, M. haemophilum, and M. genavense.Grange, J. M. (2007). \\"Environmental mycobacteria\\". In Greenwood, David; Slack, Richard; Peitherer, John; & Barer, Mike (Eds.), Medical Microbiology (17th ed.), pp. 221‚Äì227. Elsevier. ., p. 222 *Rapid growers include four well-recognized, pathogenic, rapidly growing, nonchromogenic species: M. chelonae, M. abscessus, M. fortuitum, and M. peregrinum. Other examples cause disease rarely, such as M. smegmatis and M. flavescens. The number of identified and cataloged NTM species has been increasing rapidly, from about 50 in 1997 to over 125 by January 2007. The surge is mainly due to improved isolation and identification techniques.American Thoracic Society, p.369 Even with these new techniques, though, the Runyon classification is still sometimes used to organize the mycobacteria into categories. Epidemiology NTM are widely distributed in the environment, particularly in wet soil, marshland, streams, rivers and estuaries. Different species of NTM prefer different types of environment. Grange, J. M. (2007). \\"Environmental mycobacteria\\". In Greenwood, David; Slack, Richard; Peitherer, John; & Barer, Mike (Eds.), Medical Microbiology (17th ed.), pp. 221‚Äì227. Elsevier. .p. 226\\" Human disease is believed to be acquired from environmental exposures. Unlike tuberculosis and leprosy, animal-to-human or human-to-human transmission of NTM rarely occurs. NTM diseases have been seen in most industrialized countries, where incidence rates vary from 1.0 to 1.8 cases per 100,000 persons. Recent studies, including one done in Ontario, Canada, suggest that incidence is much higher. Pulmonary NTM is estimated by some experts in the field to be at least ten times more common than TB in the U.S., with at least 150,000 cases per year. Most NTM disease cases involve the species known as Mycobacterium avium complex or MAC for short, M. abscessus, M. fortuitum and M. kansasii. M. abscessus is being seen with increasing frequency and is particularly difficult to treat.American Thoracic Society, p. 370 Mayo Clinic researchers found a three-fold increased incidence of cutaneous NTM infection between 1980 and 2009 in a population-based study of residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota. The most common species were M. marinum, accounting for 45% of cases and M. chelonae and M. abscessus, together accounting for 32% of patients. M. chelonae infection outbreaks, as a consequence of tattooing with infected ink, have been reported in the United Kingdom and the United States. Rapidly growing NTMs are implicated in catheter infections, post-LASIK, skin and soft tissue (especially post-cosmetic surgery) and pulmonary infections.De Groote, MA and Huitt G. Infections due to Rapidly Growing Mycobacteria. Clinical Infectious Diseases 2006;42:1756‚Äì1763. Pathogenesis The most common clinical manifestation of NTM disease is lung disease, but lymphatic, skin/soft tissue, and disseminated diseases are also important. Pulmonary disease caused by NTM is most often seen in postmenopausal women and patients with underlying lung disease such as cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and prior tuberculosis. It is not uncommon for alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, Marfan syndrome, and primary ciliary dyskinesia patients to have pulmonary NTM colonization and/or infection. Pulmonary NTM can also be found in individuals with AIDS and malignant disease. It can be caused by many NTM species, which depends on region, but most frequently MAC and M. kansasii.Grange, p. 225 Clinical symptoms vary in scope and intensity, but commonly include chronic cough, often with purulent sputum. Hemoptysis may also be present. Systemic symptoms include malaise, fatigue, and weight loss in advanced disease.Johnson & Odell (2014); Nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary infections. J Thorac Dis.; 6(3): 210‚Äì220. The diagnosis of M. abscessus pulmonary infection requires the presence of symptoms, radiologic abnormalities, and microbiologic cultures. Lymphadenitis can be caused by various species that differ from one place to another, but again, MAC is the main cause worldwide. Most patients are aged less than 5 years, but the incidence is rare for children having BCG vaccine. The disease has a high curability.Grange, p. 223 Soft-tissue disease due to NTM infection include post-traumatic abscesses (caused by rapid growers), swimming pool granuloma (caused by M. marinum) and Buruli ulcer (caused by M. ulcerans or M. shinshuense). Post-traumatic abscesses most commonly occur after injection. Disseminated mycobacterial disease was common in US and European AIDS patients in the 1980s and early 1990s, though the incidence has declined in developed nations since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy. It can also occur in individuals after having renal transplantation. Diagnosis A) Neck and chest of a 53-year-old woman 14 days after fractionated CO2 laser resurfacing, showing Nontuberculous Mycobacterial infection B) Neck of the patient after 5 months of multidrug therapy and pulsed dye laser treatment. Diagnosis of opportunistic mycobacteria is made by repeated isolation and identification of the pathogen with compatible clinical and radiological features. Similar to M. tuberculosis, most nontuberculous mycobacteria can be detected microscopically and grow on L√∂wenstein-Jensen medium. Many reference centres now use a nucleic acid-based method such as sequence differences detection in the gene coding for 16S ribosomal RNA to identify the species. Pulmonary NTM disease diagnosis requires both identification of the mycobacterium in the patient's lung(s), as well as a high-resolution CT scan of the lungs. Research French researchers finalized the genome sequence of M. abscessus in March 2008. The genome is available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=genome&cmd;=search&term;=abscessus.

Set in 1532, the series follows the adventures of a young Spanish boy named Esteban who joins a voyage to the New World in search of the lost Seven Cities of Gold and his father. The series was originally broadcast in Japan and the French version, edited to have different characterization and music, was subsequently redubbed and distributed in many different countries throughout the world. It is currently licensed for English-language home video release in the United Kingdom, Australia, and North America by Fabulous Films. Opening narration > It is the 16th century. From all over Europe, great ships sail west to > conquer the New World, the Americas. The men, eager to seek their fortune, > to find new adventures in new lands. They long to cross uncharted seas and > discover unknown countries, to find secret gold on a mountain trail high in > the Andes. They dream of following the path of the setting sun that leads to > El Dorado and the Mysterious Cities of Gold. Plot In 1532 a Spanish orphan named Esteban joins Mendoza, a navigator, and his associates Sancho and Pedro, in their search for one of the Seven Cities of Gold in the New World, hoping to find his father. They are joined on their quest by Zia, an Incan girl (who was kidnapped by Gomez, Gaspard, Perez and Mendoza), and Tao, the last descendant of the sunken empire of Mu (Hiva in the English dub). The series is a mix of ancient South American history, archaeology, and science fiction. The travellers encounter the Maya, Inca, and Olmecs during their journey. They discover many lost technological wonders of the Mu Empire, including a solar-powered ship (the Solaris) and The Golden Condor, a huge solar-powered ornithopter (mechanical bird), capable of traveling considerable distances under the sun's power alone. They are constantly pursued by antagonists Gomez and Gaspard, who are also in search of the Cities of Gold. The Seven Cities of Gold were built by the Emperor of Hiva over fear of a global war which would destroy all civilization. Such a war did break out, destroying the Empires of Mu and Atlantis when they used the \\"Weapons of the Sun\\". The Seven Cities of Gold hold copies of books in their \\"Universal Libraries\\" as well as powerful artifacts, including the \\"Great Legacy\\", a portable fusion reactor. Other elements of this technology turn up in unexpected places, like the Solaris in Tao's home island, Esteban's and Zia's medallions as keys to the Cities, or Tao's jar as an important piece of the Great Legacy. Reminiscences of this ancient story are present in Inca legends written on golden quipu, which only Zia can read. This triggers an obsessive quest for the Cities of Gold on the part of the Spaniards Mendoza, Gomez, Gaspard and Francisco Pizarro. Esteban seeks his long-lost father and is tied to Mendoza, who rescued Esteban from a sinking ship when he was a baby. Esteban seems to have a magical ability to make the Sun appear, which proves to be an invaluable asset throughout the series. Zia also seeks her father, from whom she was taken when she was seven and brought to Spain as a gift to the princess. She has a medallion just like the one Esteban carries. Tao seeks signs of his ancestors. He possesses an encyclopedia about their lost technology and a mysterious jar which according to the legend, only the High Priest of the City of Gold can open and proves to be the Great Legacy's cooling or control rod system. Mendoza, Sancho and Pedro are motivated by their search for gold, though Mendoza appears to be genuinely fond of the three children. The Olmecs are the descendants of survivors of the global war who hid under their mountain. Only their elite were able to survive, suspended in cryogenic hibernation. The Olmecs do not appear to be human‚Äîor if they were once Human, it is implied that they have horribly mutated from the fallout of the nuclear war that destroyed their ancestors. They are short, thin and have pointed ears and enlarged frontal bones. They are highly intelligent but devious and selfish. Led by their king, Menator, the Olmecs seek an artifact called the \\"Great Legacy\\" in order to power their cryogenic systems, as well as samples of healthy cells from the children in order to combat their mutations and their sterility. Their technology is generally inferior to that of the modern age, and they use weapons such as spears and swords. They maintain some elements of their advanced technological heritage, such as the stasis and medical technology used to keep the elite of the Olmecs in suspended animation until an opportunity arises when they can be revived, powered by what appears to be a geothermal power system. This power system is destroyed in an escape by the children and Mendoza, starting a frantic search by the Olmecs for the fusion reactor core (the Great Treasure) hidden in the City of Gold. They also have a single flying machine that appears to use very similar technology to that of the Golden Condor. It is armed with some kind of particle beam or focused heat weapon of great power. Eventually the Olmecs succeed, at great cost, in taking control of the Great Legacy. It begins to melt down without the moderation provided by Tao's jar. The resulting earthquakes and volcanism destroy the City of Gold. A world-threatening meltdown is avoided by the personal sacrifice of Esteban's father who, acting as the High Priest of the Cities, is presumed to be dead after replacing the jar. At the end of the series Mendoza, Sancho, and Pedro, having salvaged some gold before the city's destruction, return to Spain‚Äîwhile Esteban and his friends set out across the Pacific on the golden condor in search of the remaining Cities. Characters The main cast of the series dubbed into American English, includes: * () ‚Äì An orphan who was rescued at sea as a baby ten years ago by the Spanish navigator Mendoza. He wears one of the two sun medallions. He dreams of adventure and is extremely impulsive. Esteban has a fear of heights which is exacerbated by the people of Barcelona who believe that he is the \\"Child of the Sun\\" and hoist him up high at the port to call out the sun to aid the departing ships. He joins the Spaniards on their search for one of The Seven Cities of Gold in the New World, hoping to find his father. * () ‚Äì The daughter of an Inca high priest. She was kidnapped from Peru five years ago, when she was seven, by the Spanish invaders and given as a present to the Queen of Spain for her daughter, Princess Margarita. She met Esteban when she was kidnapped by Mendoza for Governor Pizarro who wanted her to read the golden quipu. Zia wears a sun medallion like Esteban's, with an interlocking sun and moon disc. * () ‚Äì The last living descendant of the sunken empire of Mu (Hiva in the English dub). He lived alone on the Gal√°pagos Islands following the death of his father. Initially he is evasive of the others' company when they wash up on his island, but when the ship Solaris was revealed he joined them on their journey. He carries with him an encyclopedia handed down to him by his Hiva ancestors. Being the most intelligent of the children, he often takes a more studious approach to problem solving with Esteban sometimes becoming irritated due to his own impulsive nature. * () ‚Äì A Spaniard, navigator for the Spanish fleet. He rescued a young Esteban from a shipwreck during one of his voyages. An experienced sailor, proficient navigator and master swordsman, Mendoza places himself in the role of a leader. It is not always clear, however, where his loyalties lie and he is often at odds with the other characters. He is accompanied by fellow sailors Sancho and Pedro. Mendoza has spent many years searching for information about the cities of gold, following his theft of a piece of Esteban's medallion when he rescued the latter as an infant. His full name is revealed to be Juan Carlos Mendoza in season three. * () and () are comical, bumbling sailors who, motivated by their greed for gold, join Mendoza and the children on their search for the Mysterious Cities of Gold. They get into a lot of scrapes, and make several attempts to escape from Mendoza's watchful eye, once they realize how tiring the quest is. Production The story was written by Jean Chalopin and Bernard Deyri√®s, and is very loosely based on the novel The King's Fifth by Scott O'Dell. The series' chief director was Hisayuki Toriumi. The producers were Max Saldinger and Atsumi Yajima (NHK). The musical score was composed by Haim Saban and Shuki Levy in the Western version (Nobuyoshi Koshibe in the Japanese version). Shingo Araki was involved with the series as an animator and some episodes were directed by Toyoo Ashida and Mizuho Nishikubo. Originally Koshibe's score was to be used for the Western version as well. However, Bernard Deyri√®s recalled his reaction to the proposed music he heard from Ulysses 31 in that he felt that the score was rather understated as he was expecting a more adventurous feel, something akin to films like Indiana Jones. At that point Haim Saban and Shuki Levy had met Deyri√®s, and became involved with the soundtracks of Ulysses 31 and The Mysterious Cities of Gold. The theme song to the Western version was performed by Noam Kaniel, an associate of Levy's.

Unlike the original series, this sequel is produced entirely in France; as a co-joint venture between the French television channel TF1, the Belgian channel La Trois, the French animation company Blue Spirit and Jean Chalopin's company Movie-Plus Group. The new seasons see the series move to China and subsequently Japan. The design of the characters are more or less the same, although some subtle changes have been made to their physical appearances. Jean Chalopin and Bernard Deyri√®s act as creative consultants on the new series, with Chalopin concentrating particularly on the scripts (which are written by Hadrian Soulez-Lariviere from Chalopin's own draft for the sequel) and Deyri√®s focusing particularly on the graphical aspects. New background music is composed by the original theme song's singer Noam Kaniel. A 45-minute special, consisting of the first two episodes of the new series, was released on December 9, 2012 on TF1. The series started its regular airing during the first half of 2013. Like the 1982 series, each episode has a summary of the previous episode, a teaser to the next and a small documentary at the end. The voices for the English-language version were recorded in Paris under the direction of voice director, Matthew G√©czy. The sequel received a premiere on the Kix (UK and Ireland) channel in the United Kingdom on November 9, 2013 before a daily airing due to start on November 11, 2013. In 2016, the third season of the show started production. =Soundtrack releases= Score by Nobuyoshi Koshibe and Katsuo Ohno  * 1982, Starchild Records, Taiyou no Ko Esteban BGM Collection Vol.1.

It separates Vancouver Island and Nootka Island., part of the Canadian province of British Columbia. It played a historically important role in the maritime fur trade. History John Webber's \\"A Native of King George's Sound\\", drawing published in a 1783 book about Captain James Cook John Webber's 'The launching of the North West America Ships of Meares at Nootka Sound in 1788 John Webber's 'Ship Cove, Queen Charlotte Sound, c. 1788 The inlet is part of the traditional territory of the indigenous Nuu-chah- nulth people. They called it Mowichat. John R. Jewitt is an Englishman who describes the area in some detail in a memoir about his years as a captive of chief Maquinna from 1802 to 1805. =European exploration and trade= On August 8, 1774, the Spanish Navy ship Santiago, under Juan P√©rez, entered and anchored in the inlet. Although the Spanish did not land, natives paddled to the ship to trade furs for abalone shells from California. P√©rez named the entrance to Nootka Sound Surgidero de San Lorenzo. The word surgidero means \\"source\\". When Esteban Jos√© Martinez arrived in 1789 he gave Nootka Sound the name Puerto de San Lorenzo de Nuca. To the Spanish establishment at Friendly Cove he gave the name Santa Cruz de Nuca. In March 1778, Captain James Cook of the Royal Navy landed on Bligh Island and named the inlet \\"King George's Sound\\". He recorded that the native name was Nutka or Nootka, apparently misunderstanding his conversations at Friendly Cove/Yuquot; his informant may have been explaining that he was on an island (itchme nutka, a place you can \\"go around\\"). There may also have been confusion with Nuu-chah-nulth, the natives' autonym (name for themselves). It may also have simply been based on Cook‚Äôs mis-pronunciation of Yuquot, the native name of the place.Alexander von Humboldt, Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain, translated by John Black, Vol. 2, London, Longman, 1822, translator‚Äôs note, p.322. The earlier Spanish and British names for the Sound swiftly went out of use. At the time, the Spanish monopolized the trade between Asia and North America, and had granted limited licenses to the Portuguese. The Russians had established a growing fur trading system in Alaska. The Spanish began to challenge the Russians, with P√©rez's voyage being the first of many to the Pacific Northwest. The British also became increasingly active in the region. The next European to visit Nootka Sound after James Cook was the British trader James Hanna in August 1785. Hanna traded iron bars for furs. He sold the furs in China for a handsome profit, beginning an era of the Maritime Fur Trade. In 1786 another maritime fur trader, James Strange, visited Nootka Sound. One of his crew, John Mackay, volunteered to remain at Nootka and work to establish relationships until Strange returned the next year. But Strange never returned. When the trader Charles Barkley arrived at Nootka in the summer of 1787, he was surprised to find John Mackay who, over the year, had learned the Nuu-chah-nulth's language and customs, adapted himself to their ways, and married a young native girl. At first Mackay was welcomed and befriended by Maquinna, but after unknowingly breaking a taboo he was exiled from Maquinna's house and forced to survive on his own. Barkley took Mackay on board his ship, Imperial Eagle. =Nootka Crisis= Starting in 1774 Spain sent several expeditions to Alaska to assert its long-held claim over the Pacific Northwest which dated back to the 16th century. During the decade 1785‚Äì1795 British merchants, encouraged by Sir Joseph Banks and supported by their government, made a sustained attempt to develop British fur trade in the area, despite Spain's claims and navigation rights. The endeavours of these merchants did not last long in the face of Spain's opposition. The challenge was also opposed by a Japan holding obdurately to national seclusion.Robert J. King, \\"'The long wish'd for object' ‚Äî Opening the trade to Japan, 1785‚Äì1795\\", The Northern Mariner / le marin du nord, vol.XX, no.1, January 2010, pp.1‚Äì35. In 1789 Spain sent Sub-Lieutenant Esteban Jos√© Martinez, commanding Princesa and San Carlos, to enforce Spanish sovereignty and defend its claims. He arrived in February 1789 and established a settlement and built Fort San Miguel. The ship , under Captain William Douglas and owned by John Meares, was impounded and the Spanish navy seized two other British ships, including . Two American ships in the area were allowed to sail as the United States was Spain's ally (Spain had helped the US in its War of Independence). However, the American ship , under Thomas Humphrey Metcalfe, was seized and taken to San Blas, before being released. The capture of the British ships led to the Nootka Crisis and near war between Britain and Spain. The British challenged Spanish claims to allegedly \\"un-colonized\\" land on the Pacific coasts of North and South America. The first Nootka Convention (1790) gave both countries the right to settle along the Pacific coasts, interrupting the Spanish monopoly for the first time in over two centuries. The British quickly sponsored the Vancouver Expedition of exploration. Difficulties in implementing the terms led to a second, and then a third Nootka Convention (1794).Robert J. King, ‚ÄúGeorge Vancouver and the contemplated settlement at Nootka Sound‚Äù, The Great Circle, vol.32, no.1, 2010, pp.3‚Äì30. The Nootka Sound controversy also played a part in the French Revolution. The Spanish Bourbon monarchy asked for French support in the dispute in the event that it led to war between Spain and Great Britain. The French Bourbon king Louis XVI wanted to back Spain against Great Britain, but his right to enter France into an alliance on his own prerogative was disputed by the National Assembly. The Assembly maintained that the King's right to determine foreign policy and declare war was subject to the sovereignty of the people. Eventually the Assembly ruled that a proposal for a declaration of war could be initiated by the king, but had to be ratified by the Assembly; this was a major blow to the monarchy. =Thomas Muir= The Scottish political reformer Thomas Muir had been banished to Port Jackson in Botany Bay in Australia for 14 years for the crime of sedition in 1793. He managed to escape having only spent 13 months there, on board the American merchant ship . After a highly adventurous voyage across the as yet largely uncharted Pacific Ocean to Vancouver Island, Otter finally dropped anchor in Nootka Sound on 22 June 1796. In conversation with Jos√© Tovar, the piloto (master) of , a Spanish vessel at anchor in the Nootka Sound, Muir learned to his dismay of the presence in neighbouring waters of , the British sloop-of- war under William Robert Broughton. This vessel had visited Port Jackson in Australia shortly before Muir‚Äôs escape and, since Broughton had almost certainly become acquainted with the captain or members of the crew, his life was now in real danger. To be captured while under sentence of transportation meant immediate execution. Once again Muir‚Äôs extraordinary luck held out. While a student at Glasgow, he had acquired a fluent command of Spanish and he was now able to persuade Tovar to break his regulations regarding the admission of foreigners into Spanish territory. Changing vessels he sailed with Tovar down the Pacific West Coast to the port of Monterey in Spanish Las Californias. The chronicles of Pierre Fran√ßois P√©ron describe Muir's escape from Australia and the voyage across the Pacific to Nootka Sound, and then as far as Monterey, California. Nootka Sound has not been the scene of any major international disagreements in modern history. It is mentioned in the former unofficial national anthem of English-speaking Canada, \\"The Maple Leaf Forever\\", to represent the western extent of Canada's \\"fair dominion\\". Climate Luna, the orca In 2001, a two-year old male orca, later named Luna, was seen in Nootka Sound alone as far inland as the marina at Gold River. Presumed to be an orphan separated from his pod, Luna became a local and international celebrity by his playful and curious behavior with tug boats and recreational watercraft on Nootka Sound, and with people, including young children, on the Gold River dock. The popularity of Luna made Nootka Sound and Gold River an international attraction from early 2002 through March 2006 when Luna was killed in an accidental collision with the propeller of the Vancouver-based tugboat, General Jackson, on Mooyah Bay in Nootka Sound. In popular culture Nootka Sound is referred to in the 2017 BBC One drama Taboo.

This page explains the theory behind what these tools set out to measure and the issues regarding these measurements. Reasons for measuring throughput in networks. People are often concerned about measuring the maximum data throughput in bits per second of a communications link or network access. A typical method of performing a measurement is to transfer a 'large' file from one system to another system and measure the time required to complete the transfer or copy of the file. The throughput is then calculated by dividing the file size by the time to get the throughput in megabits, kilobits, or bits per second. Unfortunately, the results of such an exercise will often result in the goodput which is less than the maximum theoretical data throughput, leading to people believing that their communications link is not operating correctly. In fact, there are many overheads accounted for in throughput in addition to transmission overheads, including latency, TCP Receive Window size and system limitations, which means the calculated goodput does not reflect the maximum achievable throughput.Comer, D. E. (2008). Computer Networks and Internets 5th Edition Theory: Short Summary The Maximum bandwidth can be calculated as follows: \\\\mathrm{Throughput} \\\\le \\\\frac {\\\\mathrm{RWIN}} {\\\\mathrm{RTT}} \\\\,\\\\\\\\! where RWIN is the TCP Receive Window and RTT is the round-trip time for the path. The Max TCP Window size in the absence of TCP window scale option is 65,535 bytes. Example: Max Bandwidth = 65,535 bytes / 0.220 s = 297886.36 B/s * 8 = 2.383 Mbit/s. Over a single TCP connection between those endpoints, the tested bandwidth will be restricted to 2.376 Mbit/s even if the contracted bandwidth is greater.Nelson, M. (2006). \\"The Hutter Prize\\". Bandwidth test software Bandwidth test software is used to determine the maximum bandwidth of a network or internet connection. It is typically undertaken by attempting to download or upload the maximum amount of data in a certain period of time, or a certain amount of data in the minimum amount of time. For this reason, Bandwidth tests can delay internet transmissions through the internet connection as they are undertaken, and can cause inflated data charges. A more accurate method is to use dedicated software such as Netcps, JDSU QT600, Spirent Test Center, IxChariot, Xena Networks Valkyrie & Vulcan, Iperf, Ttcp, netperf or bwping for measuring the maximum throughput of a network accesshttp://www.ookla.com/docs/, or to use VisuGATOR as a visualization tool for networking protocol analysis. Nomenclature The throughput of communications links is measured in bits per second (bit/s), kilobits per second (kbit/s), megabits per second (Mbit/s) and gigabits per second (Gbit/s). In this application, kilo, mega and giga are the standard S.I. prefixes indicating multiplication by 1,000 (kilo), 1,000,000 (mega), and 1,000,000,000 (giga). File sizes are typically measured in bytes -- kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes being usual, where a byte is eight bits. In modern textbooks one kilobyte is defined as 1,000 byte, one megabyte as 1,000,000 byte, etc., in accordance with the 1998 International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard. However, the convention adopted by Windows systems is to define 1 kilobyte is as 1,024 (or 210) bytes, which is equal to 1 kibibyte. Similarly, a file size of \\"1 megabyte\\" is 1,024 √ó 1,024 byte, equal to 1 mebibyte), and \\"1 gigabyte\\" 1,024 √ó 1,024 √ó 1,024 byte = 1 gibibyte).Nelson, M. (2006). \\"The Hutter Prize\\". =Confusing and inconsistent use of Suffixes= It is usual for people to abbreviate commonly used expressions. For file sizes, it is usual for someone to say that they have a '64 k' file (meaning 64 kilobytes), or a '100 meg' file (meaning 100 megabytes). When talking about circuit bit rates, people will interchangeably use the terms throughput, bandwidth and speed, and refer to a circuit as being a '64 k' circuit, or a '2 meg' circuit -- meaning 64 kbit/s or 2 Mbit/s (see also the List of connection bandwidths). However, a '64 k' circuit will not transmit a '64 k' file in one second. This may not be obvious to those unfamiliar with telecommunications and computing, so misunderstandings sometimes arise. In actuality, a 64 kilobyte file is 64 √ó 1,024 √ó 8 bits in size and the 64 k circuit will transmit bits at a rate of 64 √ó 1,000 bit/s, so the amount of time taken to transmit a 64 kilobyte file over the 64 k circuit will be at least (64 √ó 1,024 √ó 8)/(64 √ó 1,000) seconds, which works out to be 8.192 seconds.Nelson, M. (2006). \\"The Hutter Prize\\" Compression Some equipment can improve matters by compressing the data as it is sent. This is a feature of most analog modems and of several popular operating systems. If the 64 k file can be shrunk by compression, the time taken to transmit can be reduced. This can be done invisibly to the user, so a highly compressible file may be transmitted considerably faster than expected. As this 'invisible' compression cannot easily be disabled, it therefore follows that when measuring throughput by using files and timing the time to transmit, one should use files that cannot be compressed. Typically, this is done using a file of random data, which becomes harder to compress the closer to truly random it is. Assuming your data cannot be compressed, the 8.192 seconds to transmit a 64 kilobyte file over a 64 kilobit/s communications link is a theoretical minimum time which will not be achieved in practice. This is due to the effect of overheads which are used to format the data in an agreed manner so that both ends of a connection have a consistent view of the data. There are at least two issues that aren't immediately obvious for transmitting compressed files: # The throughput of the network itself isn't improved by compression. From the end-to-end (server to client) perspective compression does improve throughput. That's because information content for the same amount of transmission is increased through compression of files. # Compressing files at the server and client takes more processor resources at both the ends. The server has to use its processor to compress the files, if they aren't already done. The client has to decompress the files upon receipt. This can be considered an expense (for the server and client) for the benefit of increased end to end throughput(although the throughput hasn't changed for the network itself.)Comer, D. E. (2008). Computer Networks and Internets 5th Edition Overheads and data formats Comer, D. E. (2008). Computer Networks and Internets 5th Edition A common communications link used by many people is the asynchronous start-stop, or just \\"asynchronous\\", serial link. If you have an external modem attached to your home or office computer, the chances are that the connection is over an asynchronous serial connection. Its advantage is that it is simple -- it can be implemented using only three wires: Send, Receive and Signal Ground (or Signal Common). In an RS232 interface, an idle connection has a continuous negative voltage applied. A 'zero' bit is represented as a positive voltage difference with respect to the Signal Ground and a 'one' bit is a negative voltage with respect to signal ground, thus indistinguishable from the idle state. This means you need to know when a 'one' bit starts to distinguish it from idle. This is done by agreeing in advance how fast data will be transmitted over a link, then using a start bit to signal the start of a byte -- this start bit will be a 'zero' bit. Stop bits are 'one' bits i.e. negative voltage. Actually, more things will have been agreed in advance -- the speed of bit transmission, the number of bits per character, the parity and the number of stop bits (signifying the end of a character). So a designation of 9600-8-E-2 would be 9,600 bits per second, with eight bits per character, even parity and two stop bits. A common set-up of an asynchronous serial connection would be 9600-8-N-1 (9,600 bit/s, 8 bits per character, no parity and 1 stop bit) - a total of 10 bits transmitted to send one 8 bit character (one start bit, the 8 bits making up the byte transmitted and one stop bit). This is an overhead of 20%, so a 9,600 bit/s asynchronous serial link will not transmit data at 9600/8 bytes per second (1200 byte/s) but actually, in this case 9600/10 bytes per second (960 byte/s), which is considerably slower than expected. It can get worse. If parity is specified and we use 2 stop bits, the overhead for carrying one 8 bit character is 4 bits (one start bit, one parity bit and two stop bits) - or 50%! In this case a 9600 bit/s connection will carry 9600/12 byte/s (800 byte/s). Asynchronous serial interfaces commonly will support bit transmission speeds of up to 230.4 kbit/s. If it is set up to have no parity and one stop bit, this means the byte transmission rate is 23.04 kbyte/s. The advantage of the asynchronous serial connection is its simplicity. One disadvantage is its low efficiency in carrying data. This can be overcome by using a synchronous interface. In this type of interface, a clock signal is added on a separate wire, and the bits are transmitted in synchrony with the clock -- the interface no longer has to look for the start and stop bits of each individual character -- however, it is necessary to have a mechanism to ensure the sending and receiving clocks are kept in synchrony, so data is divided up into frames of multiple characters separated by known delimiters. There are three common coding schemes for framed communications -- HDLC, PPP, and Ethernet =HDLC= When using HDLC, rather than each byte having a start, optional parity, and one or two stop bits, the bytes are gathered together into a frame. The start and end of the frame are signalled by the 'flag', and error detection is carried out by the frame check sequence. If the frame has a maximum sized address of 32 bits, a maximum sized control part of 16 bits and a maximum sized frame check sequence of 16 bits, the overhead per frame could be as high as 64 bits. If each frame carried but a single byte, the data throughput efficiency would be extremely low. However, the bytes are normally gathered together, so that even with a maximal overhead of 64 bits, frames carrying more than 24 bytes are more efficient than asynchronous serial connections. As frames can vary in size because they can have different numbers of bytes being carried as data, this means the overhead of an HDLC connection is not fixed.Cisco System, Inc. (2001-2006). Cisco IOS IP Configuration Guide =PPP= The \\"point-to-point protocol\\" (PPP) is defined by the Internet Request For Comment documents RFC 1570, RFC 1661 and RFC 1662. With respect to the framing of packets, PPP is quite similar to HDLC, but supports both bit-oriented as well as byte-oriented (\\"octet-stuffed\\") methods of delimiting frames while maintaining data transparency.Lydia Parziale, D. T. (2006). TCP/IP TUTORIAL AND TECHNICAL OVERVIEW =Ethernet= Ethernet is a \\"local area network\\" (LAN) technology, which is also framed. The way the frame is electrically defined on a connection between two systems is different from the typically wide-area networking technology that uses HDLC or PPP implemented, but these details are not important for throughput calculations. Ethernet is a shared medium, so that it is not guaranteed that only the two systems that are transferring a file between themselves will have exclusive access to the connection. If several systems are attempting to communicate simultaneously, the throughput between any pair can be substantially lower than the nominal bandwidth available.Lammle, T. (2002). Cisco Certified Network Associate. London =Other low-level protocols= Dedicated point-to- point links are not the only option for many connections between systems. Frame Relay, ATM, and MPLS based services can also be used. When calculating or estimating data throughputs, the details of the frame/cell/packet format and the technology's detailed implementation need to be understood.Lydia Parziale, D. T. (2006). TCP/IP TUTORIAL AND TECHNICAL OVERVIEW Frame Relay Frame Relay uses a modified HDLC format to define the frame format that carries data. Comer, D. E. (2008). Computer Networks and Internets 5th Edition ATM The \\"asynchronous transfer mode\\" (ATM) uses a radically different method of carrying data. Rather than using variable length frames or packets, data is carried in fixed size cells. Each cell is 53 bytes long, with the first 5 bytes defined as the header, and the following 48 bytes as payload. Data networking commonly requires packets of data that are larger than 48 bytes, so there is a defined adaptation process that specifies how larger packets of data should be divided up in a standard manner to be carried by the smaller cells. This process varies according to the data carried, so in ATM nomenclature, there are different ATM Adaptation Layers. The process defined for most data is named ATM Adaptation Layer No. 5 or AAL5. Understanding throughput on ATM links requires a knowledge of which ATM adaptation layer has been used for the data being carried.Comer, D. E. (2008). Computer Networks and Internets 5th Edition MPLS Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) adds a standard tag or header known as a 'label' to existing packets of data. In certain situations it is possible to use MPLS in a 'stacked' manner, so that labels are added to packets that have already been labelled. Connections between MPLS systems can also be 'native', with no underlying transport protocol, or MPLS labelled packets can be carried inside frame relay or HDLC packets as payloads. Correct throughput calculations need to take such configurations into account. For example, a data packet could have two MPLS labels attached via 'label-stacking', then be placed as payload inside an HDLC frame. This generates more overhead that has to be taken into account that a single MPLS label attached to a packet which is then sent 'natively', with no underlying protocol to a receiving system.Smith, S. (2003). Introductions To MPLS. CISCO Higher-level protocols Few systems transfer files and data by simply copying the contents of the file into the 'Data' field of HDLC or PPP frames -- another protocol layer is used to format the data inside the 'Data' field of the HDLC or PPP frame. The most commonly used such protocol is Internet Protocol (IP), defined by RFC 791. This imposes its own overheads. Again, few systems simply copy the contents of files into IP packets, but use yet another protocol that manages the connection between two systems -- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), defined by RFC 1812. This adds its own overhead. Finally, a final protocol layer manages the actual data transfer process. A commonly used protocol for this is the \\"file transfer protocolLydia Parziale, D. T. (2006). TCP/IP TUTORIAL AND TECHNICAL OVERVIEW Tools available for measuring throughput This section cannot be exhaustive because there are many tools available, some of which are proprietary and specific to vendor applications. Some of these tools can be used for nefarious purposes. The use of these tools can possibly lead to harmful consequences even if the tester has only good intentions. So use of these should be, at a minimum, done with caution and a good understanding of the tools. * HTTPing * HTTPing for Android - It is not available on playstore. * SpeedOf.Me, HTML5 Speed Test * www.bandwidthspeedtest.co.uk, Speed Test * Iperf bandwidth measuring tool * Pingb bandwidth estimating tool * IxChariot and IxChariot Pro endpoints * ByteBlowerhttp://dst.lbl.gov/publications/ Tools to Measure the Maximum Burst Size, Available Bandwidth and Achievable Throughput * Xena Networks, https://xenanetworks.com/ See also *Asymptotic bandwidth *Network traffic measurement *Packet generation model *SpeedOf.Me - HTML5 Bandwidth Test References  External links  * *Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory paper on measuring available bandwidth Category:Network performance ","title":"Measuring network throughput"},{"id":"924302","text":"GTOPO30 is a digital elevation model for the world, developed by United States Geological Survey (USGS).

It is situated on Olav Kyrres gate in the center of Bergen, within walking distance of both the main shopping areas and the University of Bergen. History Det Akademiske Kvarter Kvarteret hosts a huge number of events each year, ranging from debates and lectures to concerts. The house is run by about 400 volunteer students. In addition to hosting cultural events, it offers the volunteers experience as sound technicians, bartenders, photographers and system administrators. The students who work here primarily come from the University of Bergen as well as from the Norwegian School of Economics (Norges Handelsh√∏yskole) and Bergen University College (H√∏gskolen i Bergen). Kvarteret has an old exterior, but the interior is roughly 10 years old. The house was formerly the property of the University, but was given over to the students to be the cultural centre of student activities in 1995. At that time, the house's interior was completely rehabilitated. Kvarteret was reopened February 5, 2010 after three years of reconstruction. There are now several pubs, a cinema, nightclub, small caf√©, auditorium and concert hall. Affiliates Though Kvarteret hosts a variety of cultural events, none of them are actually organized by Kvarteret itself. Numerous organizations use the building for their cultural activities. These include the Bergen student community (Studentersamfunnet i Bergen), Immaturus student theater club (Studentteateret Immaturus), Active student association (Aktive Studenters Forening), Bergen Realist Association (Bergen Realistforening) and the Bergen film club (Bergen Filmklubben).

Early life Richard Tauber was born in Linz, Austria, to Elisabeth Seifferth (n√©e Denemy), a widow and an actress who played soubrette roles at the local theatre, and Richard Anton Tauber, an actor; his parents were not married and his father was reportedly unaware of the birth as he was touring North America at the time. The child was given the name Richard Denemy (Denemy was his mother's maiden name); he was sometimes known as [Carl] Richard Tauber, and also used his mother's married name, Seiffert; but the claim by the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica that he was ever known as Ernst Seiffert has no support from any of the 12 published books and monographs about him listed in Daniel O'Hara's comprehensive Richard Tauber Chronology. After he was adopted by his father in 1913, his legal name became Richard Denemy-Tauber. Tauber accompanied his mother on tour to theatres, but she found it increasingly difficult to cope, and left him with foster-parents in Urfahr, now a suburb of Linz. In 1897‚Äì98 he was sent to school in Linz, and then his father took over his upbringing, moving him to Graz, Prague, Berlin, Salzburg and finally Wiesbaden. His father, who was born Jewish, but had converted to Roman Catholicism, hoped that young Tauber would become a priest. The boy missed the excitement of the theatre and instead joined his father in Prague and, subsequently, in 1903 at the theatre in Wiesbaden. Tauber hoped to become a singer but failed to impress any of the teachers he auditioned for, probably because he chose to sing Wagner, for which his voice was not suited. His father entered him at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt to study piano, composition and conducting. He made rapid progress but he still hoped to become a singer. Early career After an intense period of vocal training under Carl Beines, he made his public debut at a concert at Freiburg on 17 May 1912. That year his father was appointed Intendant of the Municipal Theatre in Chemnitz and was therefore in a position to arrange for Tauber to appear as Tamino in The Magic Flute on 2 March 1913. Some weeks later, on 16 April, he played Max in Der Freisch√ºtz, a performance which was attended by of the Dresden Opera who had already offered Tauber a five-year contract, commencing on 1 August. The Baron encouraged Tauber to take small roles with other companies to broaden his experience. During his years in Dresden, Tauber acquired his reputation as a remarkably quick student: he learned Gounod's Faust in 48 hours, Bacchus in Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos overnight, to the amazement of the composer, who conducted the performance (in Berlin). People started to call him \\"the SOS Tenor\\". He saved the German premiere of Puccini's Turandot in 1926 at the Staatsoper Dresden, learning the role of Calaf in three days when tenor Curt Taucher fell ill.\\"Tauber, Richard\\", Gro√ües S√§ngerlexikon, Walter de Gruyter (2004), p. 4658, Following some guest appearances at the Wiener Volksoper in 1920, he made his Vienna State Opera debut on 16 June in La boh√®me, substituting for an indisposed Alfred Piccaver. In 1922, Tauber signed a five-year contract with the Vienna State Opera and appearances with the Berlin State Opera followed; for many years he appeared with both companies ‚Äì four months with each, leaving four months for concerts and guest appearances with other companies and touring abroad. He sang the tenor role in many operas, including Don Giovanni, The Bartered Bride, Tosca, Mignon, Faust, Carmen and Die Fledermaus, as well as newer works such as Erich Korngold's Die tote Stadt and Wilhelm Kienzl's Der Evangelimann. Daniel O'Hara's Tauber Chronology lists 100 roles in opera and operetta that he performed on stage. It was in June 1919 that he made the first of over seven hundred gramophone records. All his vocal recordings were made for the Odeon Records label, and after 1933 for the associated Parlophone label. Tauber had a lyrical, flexible tenor voice, and he sang with a warm, elegant legato. His excellent breath control gave him a wonderful head voice and messa di voce with a superb pianissimo. He was elegant in appearance too ‚Äì although he had a slight squint in his right eye; he disguised it by wearing a monocle which, when accompanied by a top hat, added to the elegant effect. Tauber first performed in an operetta by Franz Leh√°r at the Volksb√ºhne in Berlin in 1920. This was Zigeunerliebe, in which he also appeared in Linz and Salzburg in 1921. In 1922 he was offered the role of Armand in Leh√°r's ' at the Theater an der Wien, and the experience was a resounding success. This excursion into operetta was looked down on by some, but did Tauber no harm. It gave him a new audience. It revived Leh√°r's flagging career as a composer of operetta. In the future, Leh√°r composed a number of operettas with roles written specifically for Richard Tauber, including Paganini (1925, although he was unavailable for the Vienna premiere, and first sang it in Berlin in 1926), Der Zarewitsch (1927), Friederike (1928), The Land of Smiles (1929) with the famous aria \\"Dein ist mein ganzes Herz\\", Sch√∂n ist die Welt (1930), and Giuditta (1934). The hit songs usually occurred in the second act and were informally known as Tauberlieder. Tauber appeared in a number of films, both in Germany and later in England. He provided a 'voice-over', singing the title song in the otherwise silent film I Kiss Your Hand, Madame (1929). Richard Tauber and Carlotta Vanconti, c. 1928 When in Vienna, Tauber also conducted at the Theater an der Wien, and it was here in 1924 that he met the soprano Carlotta Vanconti who soon divorced her Italian husband and married Tauber on 18 March 1926. They separated in 1928 and divorced later the same year in Berlin. The divorce was recognised, however, only in Germany. In 1929 he met Mary Losseff at Rudolf Nelson's review in Berlin. They lived together for about five years. Losseff became his muse; it was for her that he wrote Der singende Traum. Losseff's career ended when she became an alcoholic, but Tauber remained her lifelong friend and supported her until his death. In 1931, Tauber made his London debut in operetta, and London appearances became a regular event; he also toured the United States in this year. In 1933, Tauber was assaulted in the street by a group of Nazi Brownshirts because of his Jewish ancestry, and he decided to leave Germany for his native Austria, where he continued to sing at the Vienna State Opera right up to the Anschluss in March 1938. In the mid-1930s, he made several musical films in England, and at the premiere of her film Mimi in April 1935, he met the English actress Diana Napier (1905‚Äì1982); they were married on 20 June 1936, only after protracted legal proceedings to secure an Austrian divorce from Vanconti. Napier appeared in three of his British films: Heart's Desire (1935), Land Without Music and Pagliacci (both 1936). Later career In 1938, he made his London operatic debut in Die Zauberfl√∂te under Sir Thomas Beecham. Earlier that year, the Nazi government of Germany annexed Austria and Tauber left for good. In response, the Nazis withdrew the Taubers' passports and right of abode; because this left the couple technically stateless, Tauber applied for British citizenship. He was touring South Africa when World War II broke out, and returned to Switzerland until receiving the papers allowing him to enter the UK in March 1940. Despite receiving lucrative offers from the United States, he remained in the UK for the entire war. There was little opera staged in wartime Britain so he made a living by singing, conducting and making gramophone records and radio broadcasts. He even composed English operettas, together with the lyric writer Fred S. Tysh, from one of which, Old Chelsea, the song \\"My Heart and I\\" became one of his most popular English recordings. It was only these English records that brought him any royalties; for his earlier recordings he had been paid for each performance and he had been compelled to leave his savings behind in Austria. By now he was so crippled by arthritis that he could no longer move into and away from the microphone for softer and louder notes. A small trolley was built on rubber wheels so the engineers could silently roll him back and forth while recording. In 1946, Tauber appeared in a Broadway adaptation of The Land of Smiles (Yours is my Heart) which flopped, leaving him with huge personal losses and in debt to the backers. He was thus forced to tour the United States, Canada, Central and South America for six months to recoup losses, with Arpad Sandor and George Schick serving as his accompanists, and Neil Chotem as assisting artist. In April 1947, Tauber returned to London and sought medical attention for a persistent cough. He was eventually diagnosed with lung cancer: one lung was already useless and the other nearly so. Gravestone, Brompton Cemetery, London The Vienna State Opera was in London for a short season at the Royal Opera House - their first visit since the war - and they invited Tauber to sing one performance with his old company. On 27 September 1947 he sang the role of Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni, not a large part but with two difficult arias that demand good breath control to bring off well. Those in the audience say that he sang wonderfully and to loud applause. Live excerpts of these two arias from this performance survive, and they reveal a tone of undiminished focus and steadiness, a good line, and somewhat shortened phrasing. Death A week later, Tauber entered Guy's Hospital to have his left lung removed to treat the cancer but it was too late. He died on 8 January 1948 in the London Clinic, Devonshire Place. His Requiem Mass was at St. James' Church, Spanish Place. He was interred in Brompton Cemetery in London. Selected discography Tauber made over 720 vocal recordings for the Odeon/Parlophone companies, plus several as an orchestral conductor, mainly of his own works, but also of music by Grieg and Johann Strauss, Jr. Of the 120 acoustic recordings, the most important are of arias by Mozart, Tchaikovsky and Kienzl, and songs by Schumann, Richard Strauss and Grieg. There are also five duets with Elisabeth Rethberg, arias by Verdi, Puccini etc., and excerpts from Korngold's Die tote Stadt, including a duet with Lotte Lehmann. Among the electrical recordings, there are albums of German folksongs, and 12 songs from Schubert's Winterreise, accompanied by Mischa Spoliansky, and an album of folksongs by Franz Gabriel and Hermann L√∂ns. Perhaps most prized are the four Mozart arias recorded in 1938 and 1939, and the aria from Der Freisch√ºtz made in 1946. Among his last recordings are two songs by Richard Strauss, accompanied at the piano by Percy Kahn. In his lifetime, his many recordings of music by Franz Leh√°r, much of it written for him, and his own songs from the operetta Old Chelsea (1942) were best sellers, along with a huge range of lighter and popular music in German and English. A number of his broadcasts have been preserved, including a series of General Motors Concerts from America in 1937, a Radio Hilversum concert of 1939, and excerpts from his three series of weekly programmes for the BBC (1945‚Äì47).

Lichfield Cathedral, dating from the 13th and early 14th centuries is the only medieval cathedral. Between the 14th and 16th centuries Lincoln Cathedral also had three spires and was the tallest building in the world for 238 years until the central spire collapsed in 1549 and was not rebuilt. Both Truro Cathedral, Cornwall (late 19th-early 20th century) and St Mary's Episcopal Cathedral, Edinburgh (late 19th century) were built in the Gothic Revival style and also have three spires. Lichfield Cathedral Lichfield Cathedral viewed from the West Front approach Lichfield Cathedral is situated in the cathedral city of Lichfield. The cathedral dates from various periods in 13th and early 14th centuries, although this can not be allocated to fixed years, since the archives were destroyed during the English Civil War. The internal length is 370 ft (113 m), and the breadth of the nave 68 ft (21 m). The walls of the nave lean outwards slightly, this was caused by the weight of stone used in the ceiling vaulting, some 200-300 tons of which was removed during renovation work to prevent the walls leaning further. The windows of the Lady Chapel contain some of the finest medieval Flemish painted glass in existence. It came from the Abbey of Herckenrode (now in Belgium) in 1801 having been purchased by Brooke Boothby when that Abbey was dissolved during the Napoleonic Wars. It was then sold on to the Cathedral for the same price. It dates from the 1530s. There are also some fine windows by Betton and Evans (1819), and many fine late 19th century windows, particularly those by Charles Eamer Kempe. There were three sieges of Lichfield during the period 1643‚Äì1646 as the Cathedral was surrounded by a ditch and defensive walls, and made a natural fortress. The Royalists were defeated in March 1643, and the Parliamentarians a month later. In 1646, the Parliamentarians were once again victorious, but the Cathedral suffered extensive damage: the central spire was demolished, the roofs ruined and all the stained glass smashed. It is the only medieval English cathedral with three spires and has an ornate west front extensively renovated in the Victorian era by Sir George Gilbert Scott. Scott also built the three-spired St Mary's Cathedral, in Edinburgh. Truro Cathedral West front of the Cathedral of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Truro Truro Cathedral is a cathedral in the city of Truro in Cornwall in south-west England. It was built in the 19th century (from 1879) on the site of a 16th- century parish church (St Mary the Virgin) to a design by noted church architect John Loughborough Pearson, heavily influenced by Gothic ideas. It features three massive towers and spires. The central tower and spire is 250 feet (75 m) tall, the western ones reach 200 ft (60 m). Foundation stones were laid in 1880, the first section of the cathedral was consecrated in 1887, with the building finally completed in 1910. In the meantime, Pearson had died in 1897; his work was continued by his son, Frank Loughborough Pearson. St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh St Mary's Episcopal Cathedral St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh, is a cathedral of the Scottish Episcopal Church in the city of Edinburgh, Scotland. In 1689 after the abdication of James VII/II, the Reformed Church in Scotland divided over the issue of the Stuart Succession. Two churches came into being: the Presbyterian Church established by King William, and the Episcopal Church which remained loyal to the Stuart cause. One consequence was that St Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh as it then was, came under the Established Church's ministry, and the Episcopal Diocese was left without a cathedral. For a time the Episcopal residue of that congregation worshipped in an old woollen mill in Carrubber's Close, near the site of the present Old St Paul's Church. This was used as a pro-cathedral until the early 19th century, when this function was served by the Church of St Paul in York Pace. The foundation stone was laid on 21 May 1874 by the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry, whose family had been supportive of Scottish Episcopacy over the previous hundred years. Inside the stone was placed a bottle with green mountings containing a copy of the Trust Deed, the Edinburgh Post Office Directory, Oliver and Boyd's Almanac, newspapers and coins. In preparation for the opening of the cathedral a congregation had been formed to worship in a temporary iron church erected on the site now occupied by the Song School. Beginning on 26 May 1876, it was ministered to by the Dean, James Montgomery, and two chaplains, and grew rapidly. The Nave of the cathedral was opened on 25 January 1879 and from that day, daily services have been held in the cathedral. The twin spires at the west end were not begun until 1913 and completed in 1917. The architect for these was Charles Marriott Oldrid Scott, Sir George's grandson. The western spires are known as \\"Barbara\\" and \\"Mary\\" after Barbara and Mary Walker, spinster sisters, who provided funds for the cathedral's construction from 1873. They owned the surrounding Drumsheugh Estate and lived in Easter Coates House, which survives to the north of the cathedral. They were the granddaughters of Rev. George Walker, the Episcopal Minister of Old Meldrum Church (1734‚Äì1781). Their father, William Walker, was Attorney in Exchequer, and Bearer of the White Rod of Scotland. Their mother was Mary Drummond, daughter of George Drummond, six times Lord Provost of Edinburgh and initiator of the New Town.

It entered service with a number of Warsaw Pact member states beginning in 1950, and formed the mainstay of Soviet motor rifle battalions until the advent of the amphibious BTR-60 series during the 1960s. BTR-152s were available in several marks, and were manufactured in large numbers for the Soviet military and export. Late production models utilized automotive components from the more reliable ZIL-157 truck. Three primary variants of the BTR-152 appeared between 1950 and 1959: the base armored personnel carrier with a single pintle-mounted 7.62mm or 12.7mm machine gun, an unarmed command vehicle with a higher roofline, and an anti-aircraft variant armed with a ZPU-2 mount. BTR-152s could carry a single infantry squad each, or specialist weapons teams along with their mortars and anti-tank equipment. In Soviet service, a number were also deployed as artillery tractors. History =Development= During World War II, Red Army tacticians favored combined arms offensives, which emphasized the deployment of light infantry in concert with tanks. However, the Soviet infantrymen lacked the armored protection and rapid mobility of the tanks, and remained comparatively vulnerable to enemy fire.Perrett, Soviet Armour Since 1945 (1987) p. 65. By the end of the war, the initial Soviet tactic of tank desant, in which the infantry rode into battle atop the tanks they were supporting, had been superseded by the introduction of M3 Half-tracks and M3 White armored cars. These were widely used for troop transport, giving rise to a new doctrine in which armored vehicles capable of keeping pace with tanks brought infantry to an engagement. The infantrymen would then debark and enter combat dismounted.Tucker, Spencer. The Encyclopedia of Middle East Wars: The United States in the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq Conflicts, Volume 1. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, 2010. p. 243 Wartime experiences demonstrated that the Red Army had an urgent postwar requirement for more wheeled armored vehicles, and the general staff specified a new reconnaissance vehicle and armored personnel carrier (APC). The APC had to be capable of transporting at least eight troops. A new design bureau at the Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod (GAZ) was set up to study potential concepts accordingly; their final prototype, the Izdeliye 141 (BTR-40), was accepted into service but was regarded as too small to be used in an APC role. Meanwhile, specifications for another APC had been issued, capable of seating 15 to 20 additional passengers and armed with a single heavy machine gun. Existing M3 half-tracks and captured German Sd.Kfz. 251s were studied as potential references for the upcoming pre-production design. Concept work on the new APC began at the Zavod imeni Stalina (ZiS) factory in Moscow, overseen by Soviet engineer Boris Mikhailovich Fitterman, at roughly the same time the Izdeliye 141 was being developed by GAZ. Prototypes were built with automotive components from the ZiS-151 production line; however, the APC chassis incorporated a more powerful engine and a shorter wheelbase than its utility truck counterpart. Design work was carried out by a team of five ZiS employees: Fitterman, K. M. Androsov, A. P. Petrenko, V. F. Rodionov and P. P. Chernyaev. The final prototype was trialed by the Soviet Armed Forces in December 1949 and accepted into service as the BTR-152. Serial production of the BTR-152 under the manufacturer's code ZiS-152 commenced around mid 1950, making it the first mass-produced Soviet APC. Despite being designed around the same time, the BTR-40 did not enter serial production until the end of the year. The BTR-152 was used by the Soviet military as a command and communications vehicle, fire support vehicle, artillery tractor, and general transporter. Being open-topped, the BTR-152's crew was vulnerable to indirect fire. In later years, the vehicle was not ideal for the prospect of a major conventional war in Europe either, as it lacked amphibious capability or NBC countermeasures. However, these early BTRs remained effective as a low-cost option that allowed the Soviets to rapidly motorize their existing infantry divisions. A program in the late 1950s looked at ways to replace the BTR-152 with a more sophisticated APC utilizing a purpose-designed, amphibious chassis. As the BTR-152's six-wheeled configuration was deemed insufficient to reduce ground pressure on the tires and produce optimal cross-country performance, Soviet engineers embarked on an eight-wheeled APC program, which resulted in the BTR-60. Approximately 8,600 BTR-152s of all variants were manufactured in the Soviet Union, with some unlicensed copies being produced in the People's Republic of China as the Type 56. Soviet BTR-152s were produced between 1950 and 1959, being supplemented by the BTR-60 from 1960 onwards. As they became increasingly obsolescent, many were shipped to Soviet client states in Africa and the Middle East; the largest quantity of second-hand BTR-152s were accepted by Arab nations such as Libya, Iraq, Syria, and Egypt. Small quantities were also converted to armored ambulances and combat engineering vehicles for the Soviet Army; these remained in service as late as the 1980s. =Service= BTR-152 knocked out during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. BTR-152s first saw combat during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, when they were deployed by the 12th Motorized Brigade of the Soviet Internal Troops to crush Hungary's fledgling uprising. The BTRs were deployed in Budapest and other settlements, as well as on the Hungarian border with Austria. A number were damaged or destroyed by insurgents armed with molotov cocktails, which were pitched into the open troop compartments without apparent difficulty. Since they were wheeled, some BTR-152s were also immobilized when their rubber tires caught fire, and had to be abandoned by their crews. Egypt was one of the first major export customers for the BTR-152 outside Eastern Europe; in 1954, it ordered 200 from the Soviet Union, and between 1961 and 1966 it received another 600 in second-hand condition, possibly as military aid. Syria likewise received at least 200 BTR-152s in 1966, and another 300 three years later. These were deployed against the Israel Defense Forces during the Six-Day War. In Syrian service, they were utilized as makeshift infantry fighting vehicles rather than APCs; infantrymen remained mounted and used the BTR-152 as a firing platform rather than debark and fight on foot. Nevertheless, failure to coordinate combined arms maneuvers often left the Syrian motorized infantry separated from their supporting tank formations and vulnerable to Israeli heavy armor. Israel captured over 1,000 BTR-152s from Arab armies during the Six-Day War and the subsequent Yom Kippur War. BTR-152s were deployed by the National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) during the First Chadian Civil War, and were instrumental in a motorized assault on Salal in April 1978. The BTRs were knocked out by Panhard AML-90 armored cars of the French Foreign Legion. Libyan mechanized battalions also deployed BTR-152s in Chad during the Chadian-Libyan conflict, often in concert with tank companies or EE-9 Cascavels. Several were destroyed after taking direct hits from AML-90 cannon fire or SS.11 anti-tank missiles. BTR-152s formed the mainstay of mechanized units on both sides during the Ogaden War. The Somali National Defense Force (SNDF) ordered enough BTR-152s from the Soviet Union in the late 1960s to accommodate a massive expansion in its armored and mechanized capabilities, and equip nine new mechanized battalions. About half of Somalia's BTR-152s appear to have been lost in the Ogaden conflict. Soviet weapons deliveries to Ethiopia accelerated after the outbreak of war, and starting in March 1977 included 40 BTR-152s appropriated from the Soviet Army's reserve stocks. These vehicles were mostly BTR-152Vs but also included the BTR-152A anti-aircraft variant. The Soviet Union donated at least six BTR-152s to Mozambique shortly after that country's independence in the mid 1970s. Mozambican BTR-152s were deployed against Rhodesian Security Forces conducting cross-border raids, as well as in search and destroy operations mounted near Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) strongholds. It is likely that all Mozambique's BTR-152s were eliminated by land mines or Rhodesian air strikes; they were not in service long before being superseded by the BTR-60. A second shipment of BTR-152s was delivered to the People's Forces of Liberation of Mozambique (FPLM) in 1983, but it remains unclear whether these were deployed in front-line service. During the Lebanese Civil War, both Lebanese militias and Syrian Army used BTR-152s. Description Troop seating in the BTR-152's rear compartment. The BTR-152 is a modified truck chassis with an armored hull and an open-topped troop compartment. The sides and rear of the troop compartment are vertical, with corners sloping inwards to deflect shell fragments. There are firing ports on each side of the troop compartment and two rear doors for rapid debarking. Infantrymen can fire their individual weapons from the relative protection of the vehicle, and exit through these doors or by jumping over the sides. The crew consists of a driver and a single passenger, who operates the radios. Two types of seating arrangements were available: the first consists of wooden benches on either side of the troop compartment facing inwards; the second consisted of three rows of seats facing forward. Both the driver and the radio operator seated to his right are provided with individual windscreens and, when in combat, these are covered by twin armored shutters with integral vision blocks. Crew members exit the vehicle through side doors, the tops of which are hinged and fold down for observation purposes. The BTR-152's armor plate is fabricated of welded steel and ranges from to in thickness. This protects the crew and passengers from small arms fire, shell fragments, grenades, and anti-personnel mines, but is ineffective against larger shell fragments or even heavy machine gun fire. Late production hulls may have been manufactured from steel plate with a thickness of up to . The vehicle is sometimes fitted with a winch that has a maximum capacity of 5 tonnes and a 70m cable. Depending on the variant, BTR-152s can tow field artillery, transport 1.9 tonnes of cargo, or carry a half platoon of infantry. Most Soviet BTR-152s were powered by a six-cylinder ZiL-123 in-line water-cooled petrol engine developing 110 hp at 2,900 rpm. Those based on the chassis and components of the ZiL-157 utility truck utilized a slightly different ZiL-137K engine. There are several engine louvers on the front of the hull to prevent overheating; these could be safely closed for short intervals during combat, as long as the driver reduced speed and avoided overtaxing the vehicle. A BTR-152's gearbox comprised five forward gears and one reverse gear with a two-speed transfer box. Fifth gear had an overdrive. The suspension consisted of conventional leaf springs with hydraulic shock absorbers. In the late 1950s, a little over 200 BTR-152s were produced with enclosed hulls, as opposed to the traditionally open-topped design; these were designated BTR-152K and BTR-152K1. They were also known unofficially as \\"BTR-152 Model D\\" or \\"BTR-152 M1961\\" by some Warsaw Pact armies. The enclosed hull reduced situational awareness but allowed for the installation of central heating and an NBC overpressure system. Two hatches opening to the right were installed on the new roofline. Driver's position in a BTR-152. The BTR-152 was originally armed with a single pintle-mounted 7.62mm SG-43 Goryunov (SGMB) medium machine gun, fed by 1,250 rounds of stored on-board ammunition. This was mounted behind the driving position. Additional 7.62mm general-purpose machine guns could be mounted on either side of the hull top as needed. The SGMB machine gun could traverse 45 degrees and elevate between -6 and +24 degrees. Some of the BTRs were fitted with single 12.7mm DShK or 14.5mm KPV heavy machine guns in place of the SGMB. Vehicles designated BTR-152A were ground support vehicles with limited air defense capability. BTR-152As carried twin KPVs in a ZPU-2 anti-aircraft mount. Variations included an Egyptian model with a Czechoslovak M53 Quad mounting for four DShKs, which were normally towed on a two-wheeled trailer, and some modified by the Palestine Liberation Organization to accept 23mm ZU-23-2 anti- aircraft guns. Because the original BTR-152 utilized the chassis and engine of the ZiS-151, it shared that truck's maintenance problems and poor cross- country mobility. Later variants, using ZiL-157 components, had more power and larger, single tires that reduced the vehicle's shortcomings but did not entirely eliminate them. Serviceability and reliability remained low.

Running about 89 km (50 mi) north-south and 48 km (35 mi) east-west, it is 2,754.835 km¬≤ (1,063.65 mi¬≤) in area, making it the 12th largest island in the United States and the 167th largest island in the world. Its center is located near . The island is separated from the Alaska mainland to the east by Behm Canal, from Prince of Wales Island to the west by the Clarence Strait, and from Annette Island to the south by Revillagigedo Channel and Nichols Passage. The island is traditional Tlingit territory, and by the nineteenth century was divided between the Saanyaa ·∏¥w√°an and Taant ºa ·∏¥w√°an tribes or subdivisions. The first European recorded as having sighted it was Spanish explorer Jacinto Caama√±o in 1792; it was named the following year by George Vancouver for Juan Vicente de G√ºemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo, then viceroy of New Spain (Mexico). The island's population was 13,950 as of the 2000 census. The only cities on the island are Ketchikan and Saxman, although the unincorporated community of Ward Cove and the historical community of Loring are also on the island. The principal industries are fishing, canning, logging and tourism. In addition to the cities, several logging communities are based on barges, which move about the waterways. These serve the unconnected system of logging roads that dot the island and have access to waterfront.

A prominent member of the Grande chapelle, the Habsburg musical establishment, he was a renowned composer in the years around 1500, and his music was widely distributed throughout Europe. He composed music in all of the important sacred and secular styles of the time.Wegman/Fitch, Grove online  Life  Very little is known of Agricola's early life. He was born in Ghent, as suggested by a recently discovered epitaph, written in 1538. Rob C. Wegman, et al. \\"Agricola, Alexander.\\" In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, (accessed May 22, 2011) Most of his life he spent in posts in Italy, France and the Low Countries, though there are gaps where his activities are not known, and he seems to have left many of his posts without permission. He was a singer for Duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza of Milan from 1471 to 1474, during the period when the Milanese chapel choir grew into one of the largest and most famous ensembles in Europe; Loyset Comp√®re, Johannes Martini, Gaspar van Weerbeke, and several other composer-singers were also in Milan during those years.Lerner, Grove In 1474 Duke Galeazzo Maria wrote a letter of recommendation for him to Lorenzo de' Medici, and Agricola accordingly went to Florence. In 1476 he is known to have been in Cambrai, in the Low Countries, where he probably was employed as a singer. For the long period from 1476 to 1491 nothing definite is known except that he spent part of the time in the French royal chapel, and he must have been building his reputation as a composer during this time, for he was much in demand in the 1490s, with France and Naples competing for his services. In 1500 he took a position with Philip the Handsome, who was Duke of Burgundy and King of Castile. He apparently accompanied the Duke on his travels through his empire; by this time he was one of the most esteemed composers in Europe. He was in Valladolid, Spain, in August 1506, where he died during an outbreak of the plague on 15 August of that year.  Musical style  = Related schools and composers = Agricola is one of the few transitional figures between the Burgundian School and the style of the Josquin generation of Netherlanders who actually wrote music in both styles. Agricola's style is related to that of Johannes Ockeghem, especially early in his career, and towards the end of his life he was writing using the pervasive imitation characteristic of Josquin des Prez. While few of his works can be dated precisely, he does use many of the non-imitative, complex, rhythmically diverse contrapuntal procedures more often associated with Ockeghem. Unlike Ockeghem, however, he was willing to employ repetition, sequence, and florid imitation in the manner of the other composers who were working around 1500 when the technique became widespread. = Genres = Agricola wrote masses, motets, motet-chansons, secular songs in the prevailing formes fixes such as rondeaux and bergerettes, other chansons, and instrumental music. Much of his instrumental music was based on secular music by Gilles Binchois or Ockeghem. Many of these pieces had become quite popular in the late 15th century. = Compositional hallmarks = Above all the variants in his general musical style over his working life, Agricola himself wrote in a highly distinctive style, taking the mysteriously sinuous lines of Ockeghem as his point of departure. His music is often very busy and highly detailed, with repeated sequence, repetition of terse rhythmic and motivic units, and a desire to usurp the underlying pulse, sometimes seeming to border on the perverse, either by prolonging cadential figures to cadence on the \\"wrong\\" beat, or by shifting the metrical beat of some parts against others. As an example, the closing Agnus Dei of his unusually extended Missa 'In myne zin' features the cantus firmus stated in equal notes of eleven quavers' duration each in first statement, followed by a statement of five quavers' duration each, or in the second Salve Regina setting, offsetting part of the statement of the cantus firmus by a quaver for its entire duration, in both cases with the other voices proceeding in a more strict quadruple meter above. Other \\"games\\" played in the music include posing puzzles of mode and musica ficta for the performers (e.g. the Kyrie of the Missa Le serviteur plays with the expectations of the very well known plainchant cantus firmus by setting up some knotty issues of the implied possibility of modal inflection with consistent extra flats.) The music is characteristically athletic in all voice parts, with the lower parts in particular featuring much that requires very fine singers, and not representing the normal simply harmonic function of the tenor-bass combinations used by most of his contemporaries. Often a highly elaborate set of quick motifs will spring unexpected from a previous slow- moving texture (e.g. the eruption of detailed duos beginning at Glorificamus te and climaxing at Adoramus te in the Gloria of the Missa in myne zin). His music was very highly regarded in its day, the very distinctive style leading to one contemporary commentator referring to it as \\"crazy\\", and another as \\"sublime\\".

Alexander's younger sister was the impressionist painter Mary Cassatt. His mother Katherine came from a banking family. She was educated and very well read. It was said that of the seven children Alexander most resembled his mother in \\"appearance and temperament.\\" In 1856 he entered Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to study Civil Engineering where his senior thesis was entitled \\"Review of Pressure Turbine.\\" After graduating in the summer of 1859, Robert Cassatt took Alexander to see a former neighbor from Lancaster Pennsylvania, James Buchanan, 15th President of the United States. By the fall of 1860, Alexander had secured a position as a surveyor or rodman by the Georgia Railroad. By the time the State of Georgia voted to secede from the Union in January 1861, Cassatt had abandoned his work as surveyor on the Dalton-Knoxville line of the Georgia Railroad and returned to Pennsylvania without seeing any military service during the Civil War. Career =Pennsylvania Railroad= Frequently referred to as A. J. Cassatt, the great accomplishment under his stewardship was the planning and construction of tunnels under the Hudson River to finally bring PRR's trunk line into New York City. His purchase of a controlling interest in the Long Island Rail Road and the construction of tunnels under the East River created a PRR commuter network on Long Island. Unfortunately, Cassatt died before his grand Pennsylvania Station in New York City was completed. Pennsylvania Station, New York, NY (1911, demolished 1963). Cassatt joined the PRR in 1861 as an engineer and rapidly rose through the ranks. He was a vice president in 1877 when the Pittsburgh Railway Riots broke out in 1877, and had become Pennsy First Vice-President by 1880. He was disappointed to be passed over for the presidency and resigned from the company in 1882. During his absence he devoted his time to horse raising but still was able to organize a new railroad the New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad (NYP&N;), that connected southern markets with the north. Despite no longer being an executive with PRR, he was elected to the PRR's board of directors and was recalled in 1899 to serve as president. Cassatt more than doubled the PRR's total assets during his term, from $276 million to $594 million, while Track and equipment investment increased by almost 150 percent. The route from New York through Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Altoona to Pittsburgh was made double-tracked throughout; to Washington, D.C., four-tracked‚ÄîPennsy's \\"Broad Way.\\" Many other lines were double-tracked; almost every part of the system was improved. New freight cutoffs avoided stations; grade crossings were eliminated, flyovers were built to streamline common paths through junctions, terminals were redesigned, and much more. Cassatt initiated the Pennsy's program of electrification which led to the road being the United States' most electrified system. Cassatt was succeeded as Pennsylvania Railroad president by James McCrea. =Civil engineer= In the Spring of 1861, Cassatt had been hired as part of the Engineer Corps of the Pennsylvania Railroad, again as a rodman where he worked on the Connecting Railway. It is unknown how Cassatt managed to avoid the Pennsylvania militia draft during the Union mobilization in this period but in 1864, Cassatt was transferred to Renovo, Pennsylvania, as a resident engineer to work on the middle division of the Philadelphia and Erie railroad. In 1866, Cassatt became superintendent of motive power and machinery for the Oil Creek and Allegheny River Railway, recently reorganized in 1864 as the Warren and Franklin Railroad which was growing rapidly due to the discovery of oil in the region and coal mining. In 1867, Cassatt was appointed as superintendent of motive power and machinery for the Pennsylvania railroad in Altoona with a salary of $3,000 per year ($=) when a trainman made less than $10 a week ($=). Sometime during Cassatt's tenure as superintendent, he married Lois Buchanan, daughter of the Rev. Edward Y. Buchanan and Ann Eliza Foster. Lois Buchanan was a niece of James Buchanan, 15th President of the United States, and through her mother, a niece of songwriter Stephen Foster. The couple had two sons and two daughters. =Chesterbrook Farm= Cassatt's Rittenhouse Square townhouse at 202 South 19th St., Philadelphia, PA (demolished 1972). Now the site of The Rittenhouse Hotel. Cassatt was a horse enthusiast and fox hunter who owned Chesterbrook Farm, outside Berwyn, Pennsylvania, where he bred Thoroughbred racehorses. The property is today the site of a subdivision with office buildings and homes using the Chesterbrook Farm name. The original main barn designed by Philadelphia architect Frank Furness has been maintained and restored. (Furness also designed Cassatt's Rittenhouse Square townhouse.) Cassatt initially raced under the pseudonym, Mr. Kelso, and his horses as from the Kelso Stable. He owned the 1886 Preakness Stakes winner, The Bard, and the 1889 Belmont Stakes 1889 winner, Eric. As well, he bred the winner of the 1875, 1876, 1878, and 1880 Preakness Stakes and Foxford, who won the 1891 Belmont. In addition to flat-racing his Thoroughbreds, in 1895 Cassatt helped found the National Steeplechase Association to organize competitive steeplechase racing. He was also responsible for the introduction of the Hackney pony to the United States. In 1878 he acquired 239 Stella in Britain and brought her to Philadelphia. In 1891, Cassatt and several fellow Hackney enthusiasts founded the American Hackney Horse Society. The organization and registry continues to this day, with its headquarters now in Lexington, Kentucky. Death Cassatt died in 1906 at his Rittenhouse Square townhouse in Philadelphia, after a six-month illness. He was interred in the Church of the Redeemer Cemetery in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. His widow died in 1920.  Legacy  His statue at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania The street crossing the former Pennsylvania Railroad tracks at Berwyn station is named Cassatt Avenue. Gramercy Mansion in Baltimore, Maryland, was built by Alexander Cassatt in 1902. In 1910, the Pennsylvania Railroad erected a statue of Cassatt, by Adolph Alexander Weinman, in a niche at New York City's new Pennsylvania Station. An inscription below the niche read: The statue is currently located at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg, Pennsylvania.

Nardwuar got his start in media at the University of British Columbia radio station CITR 101.9 FM in Vancouver.\\"Letter of Recommendation: Nardwuar the Human Serviette\\". New York Times, By DAVID REES MARCH 19, 2015 His show has been running every Friday afternoon since October 1987. The program features a mix of eclectic music, along with interviews and commentary. Nardwuar's interviews are frequently shown on MuchMusic's Going Coastal, or printed in Chart. Although Nardwuar's favourite targets are music artists, he has stated that he will interview any celebrity. He also sometimes appears as a guest host and interviewer on CBC Radio 3 and started his own weekly program on freeform radio station WFMU which ran from 2009 to 2013. A typical interview will begin with \\"Who are you?\\", followed by \\"From?\\" if the subject doesn't volunteer their affiliations. Each interview ends with \\"Keep on rockin' in the free world\\", and the \\"doot doola doot doo...\\" of \\"Shave and a Haircut\\", to which the interviewee is expected to reply with the final \\"doot doo!\\" before Nardwuar freezes with a wide smile until the camera cuts off. Interviews also often end with Nardwuar asking the interviewee \\"Why should people care about [interviewee's name]?\\". When asked to explain his name, Nardwuar has said it is \\"a dumb, stupid name like Sting or Sinbad;\\" and that \\"Human\\" came from the song \\"Human Fly\\" by The Cramps; and \\"Serviette\\" came from the fact that \\"in the U.S.A. they don't have serviettes, they have napkins\\". Early life Nardwuar was born John Ruskin in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in 1968. His father Vernon was an engineer and his mother, Olga Ruskin, was a local journalist, high school history teacher and historian. She published a history of Vancouver historical figure \\"Gassy Jack\\" John Deighton. His mother exposed her son to local history by bringing him to historical society meetups. Nardwuar won a public speaking competition while in elementary school, where he was also a long-distance runner. Nardwuar attended Hillside Secondary School in West Vancouver, where he was a member of the student council. It was through the student council that he began booking bands for school events, and conducted his first interview, with Art Bergmann of Poisoned. He was accepted into the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 1986, the same year he changed his name to Nardwuar. He began volunteering at the campus radio station, CITR. While studying history at UBC, Nardwuar wrote papers on Vancouver's Lions Gate Bridge and the assassination of John F. Kennedy. He graduated in 1990 with a bachelor's degree in history. Interviews Nardwuar does extensive research on the interviewee to confuse, scare or impress them. In 'Nardwuar Vs Skrillex', he produced the first CD Skrillex was ever featured on as Sonny Moore. Skrillex then questioned his manager and girlfriend, Ellie Goulding, during the interview who revealed she did not know that era of Skrillex's past . During an interview with Pharrell Williams from N.E.R.D., Nardwuar pulled out a vinyl record featuring the very first recorded track by Pharrell, causing him to pause and say, \\"This is one of the most impressive interviews I've ever experienced in my life. Seriously.\\" Later in the same interview, Pharrell said, \\"Your research is second-to-none. Second-to-none.\\" During a 2010 interview with rapper Drake and his producer 40, Drake described Nardwuar's interview as the \\"best that I've ever done in my entire life\\". In an interview with Ludacris, Nardwuar mentioned a high-school friend, Vanesha, to which Ludacris replied, \\"You're crazy, you know that?\\" followed by, \\"How the hell did you find that out? What the hell is going on?\\" . Due to his absurd and eccentric style, he has been attacked verbally, physically threatened, and intimidated by people such as Sebastian Bach of Skid Row (who stole Nardwuar's favorite toque), the band Quiet Riot (who chased Nardwuar and crew down the street), Sonic Youth and Dave Rowntree of Blur. Alice Cooper, Henry Rollins, Travis Barker, Lydia Lunch, Harlan Ellison, Beck, Nas, and others have hung up on him or been verbally combative in interviews.Chris Dafoe, \\"It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a punk-rock attack\\" The Globe and Mail, April 23, 1998, p. C1 Chris Fehn of Slipknot, Kid Cudi and Lil Uzi Vert have left midway through an interview. More often the experience confuses the celebrities. Members of GWAR tried not to laugh while in character. Jello Biafra was impressed with his guerrilla interview style, but became noticeably angered in a 2000 interview when Nardwuar began to discuss former Dead Kennedys bandmates' lawsuit against Biafra. Dave Rowntree of Blur apologized to Nardwuar in 2011 for his behavior during a 2003 interview, calling it \\"one of the things I'm ashamed of\\" and classified his actions as \\"bullying\\". Nardwuar accepted the apology via Twitter. Nardwuar's unorthodox approach often ends up in bizarre scenarios. Some of his subjects recognize Nardwuar's eccentric style and successfully manage to reverse the scenario on him, especially Iggy Pop, David Cross, Steel Panther, Mudhoney, \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic, Lil B and Eric Andre. Some interpret his hijinks as intentionally disrespectful, including Nas and pornographer Al Goldstein. Henry Rollins found Nardwuar to be disingenuous, saying \\"I like the character that you're playing. I like that you can turn it on and off. That's cute.\\" Nardwuar made several attempts at contacting Courtney Love, first in 1991 over the telephone, talking about Danelectro guitars and asking her about her P.O. box before she ended the conversation. He later was able to get full interviews out of her after sneaking backstage into a dressing room at a 1993 Hole show in Vancouver, B.C., and again in November 1994 backstage at the Commodore Ballroom. Love was also present during Nardwuar's interview with Nirvana in January 1994 at the backstage of the Vancouver Forum. =Interviews with non- musicians= Nardwuar has also been known to be a \\"guerrilla journalist,\\" often sneaking into press conferences under the guise of an orthodox reporter, to confront political leaders or other non-musical celebrities with surreal questions. He has asked Mikhail Gorbachev which world leader had the biggest pants, and Crispin Glover whether he owns a coffin full of tar. On another occasion, Nardwuar persistently asked faith healer Ernest Angley if there was a cure for \\"the Summertime Blues\\", to which Angley angrily replied, \\"Oh I wish you would shut up, man. You know you're not even funny. You're lucky God don't strike you dead.\\" In November 1997, he cut off all his hair and was able to sneak into an APEC conference to ask Jean Chr√©tien if he supported the pepper spraying of protesters outside. Chr√©tien, apparently unaware of the incident and not knowing what the English terms \\"mace\\" and \\"pepper spray\\" referred to, responded with a line that has become well known in Canada: \\"For me, pepper, I put it on my plate.\\"Kerry Gold, \\"Who is Nardwuar: He's obnoxious, persistent, clever & curious\\", Vancouver Sun, Apr 23, 1998, p. C1 Hip Flip In June 2004, Nardwuar convinced an amused Paul Martin, former Prime Minister of Canada, to play a quick game of the Hasbro game \\"Hip Flip\\" while he was on the campaign trail. After Martin won the election, Nardwuar commented on the great predictive power of the \\"Hip Flip,\\" because neither of the other two candidates had performed the act. On a campaign trip to Vancouver in December 2005, Nardwuar concluded an interview with the late New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton‚Äîwho, in their first encounter, had taken the instructions to the game and said he would practice for their next encounter‚Äîwith a successful, coordinated, swinging of their hips. The 22nd Prime Minister Stephen Harper is the only major candidate from the 2004 election who has never performed a successful \\"Hip Flip\\" with Nardwuar. Nardwuar was escorted out by Harper's security while trying to initiate the game. In the 2015 Canadian federal election, the first federal leader to complete the Hip Flip game was Justin Trudeau, who did so on September 10 after a press conference in Vancouver. Premier Christy Clark (Liberal) , Premier John Horgan (NDP) and Andrew Weaver (Green) all did the Hip Flip during the 2017 British Columbia general election. During the 2019 Canadian Federal Election, New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh was the only head of a political party to attempt the Hip Flip. Tributes The music video for the 2005 Korn song \\"Twisted Transistor\\" is a mockumentary that includes a fictional documentary filmmaker named \\"Rob Piner\\", whose behavior and appearance are based on Nardwuar. On October 12, 2012 a video was posted on YouTube in which rapper Sean Price parodied Nardwuar's distinctive style in an interview with Duck Down labelmate Pharaohe Monch. In the video the rapper dressed and conducted the interview similarly to Nardwuar, entitled \\"Seanwuar.\\" In January 2013, Brother Ali released a song called \\"Nardwuar\\", to commemorate his interview with Nardwuar; the song features a beat taken from one of the records that Nardwuar gave Ali as a gift. At the 2013 South by Southwest Festival film director Brent Hodge and producer Chris Kelly did a retrospective of Nardwuar's career for Time. In his 2013 mixtape Innanetape, Vic Mensa referenced Nardwuar in the song \\"Tweakin' (feat. Chance the Rapper)\\" with the lyric \\"Thumbs up to the camera like Nardwuar.\\" While Nardwuar was recovering from heart surgery, Kyle Mooney produced a mock Nardwuar interview with Matt Mondanile.Watch SNL‚Äôs Kyle Mooney Parody Nardwuar Interviewing Ducktails, by James Rettig, at Stereogum; published January 15, 2016; retrieved May 14, 2016 On his 2016 album Top of the Line, in the song of the same name, Rittz references Nardwuar with the lyric \\"shit I can't recall the last 15 years wishing I could do an interview with Nardwuar\\". The track \\"Night Song\\" from the 2017 EP Brothers of Destruction by The Lemon Twigs, has the line \\"we saw the highway patrol taking selfies with Nardwuar.\\" September 29th 2019 was declared \\"Nardwuar Day\\" in Vancouver by Kennedy Stewart, the Mayor of Vancouver. In 2019, Nardwuar was inducted into the BC Entertainment Hall of Fame and included in their starwalk on Granville Street in Downtown Vancouver.

The line is narrow gauge and long. It is the remainder of what was a much larger network (over ) that also served the western town of Peel, the northern town of Ramsey and the small mining village of Foxdale. Now in government ownership, it uses original rolling stock and locomotives and there are few concessions to modernity. History Isle Of Man Railway Port Erin line (highlighted) Share certificate of the Isle of Man Railway Company Ltd, issued 16 September 1875 The line from Douglas to Port Erin is the last remaining line of the former Isle of Man Railway Company, formed in 1870. Its first line, from Douglas to Peel, opened on 1 July 1873, followed by the Port Erin line on 1 August 1874. Initially the Port Erin line had been planned to terminate at Castletown, but the construction of deep water docks at Port Erin caused an extension to the line. A few years after completion, the dock was destroyed by heavy seas and the idea of deep water vessels abandoned there. The remains of the breakwater are still visible at low tide. A third line was built in 1878‚Äì1879 by the Manx Northern Railway, from St John's (on the Douglas to Peel line) to Ramsey. A further short line was constructed from St John's to Foxdale in 1885 to serve the lead mines there. Although it was built by the nominally independent Foxdale Railway, it was leased to and operated by the Manx Northern. The loss of the mineral traffic from Foxdale and competition for the Douglas-Ramsey passenger traffic from the Manx Electric Railway placed the Manx Northern Railway in financial difficulties. It was taken over by the IMR in 1904. During the mid-1920s the IMR formed a bus subsidiary that operated most of the island's bus services, and helped the railway to remain profitable into the 1960s. The first serious examination of the long term viability of the railway came with the Howden Report in 1949, which recommended the closure of the Ramsey line, which was already losing money; the eventual closure of the Peel line, which was breaking even in the late 1940s; and the retention of the then profitable Port Erin line. Howden also reported that the existing equipment of the railway had an economic life of 10‚Äì25 years. Economies were made throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. These included the ending of evening and Sunday services, the deferral of track maintenance, and cuts to train mileage as locomotives became unserviceable. To further reduce expenses, there were winter closures of the Peel line (1960-61 only) and the Ramsey line after September 1961, but A. M. Sheard, the then general manager, refused to close the Ramsey line which by this time was losing a considerable amount of money each year. Following the closure of the County Donegal Railways in 1960, the IMR purchased the CDR's two most modern diesel railcars, which were then largely used on the Peel line in summer, and after 1962 worked the whole of the winter service except when withdrawn for maintenance. The system closed after the 1965 season but was briefly revived when the Marquess of Ailsa obtained a lease and reopened all three routes in 1967. Both the Peel and Ramsey lines shut following the 1968 season, but goods services between Peel and Milntown (just short of Ramsey) continued until mid-1969. Traffic was poor on the two northern lines, especially that to Ramsey, so after the end of the 1968 season, Ailsa decided to concentrate on passenger service on the South Line for three more seasons until he took the option to end his lease at the close of the 1971 season. There were occasional empty coaching stock workings between Douglas and St John's in 1970 and 1971 for the retrieval of stored stock between seasons. During this time most of the early wooden framed carriages were moved to St John's, where they were lost in a fire in July 1975. The Peel and Ramsey routes and the Foxdale line were lifted in 1975. The IMR operated services between Douglas and Port Erin after Lord Ailsa took his five-year option, beginning in 1972 through the centenaries of the Peel and Port Erin lines in 1973 and 1974 respectively. In 1975, the Port Erin line operated only from its southwestern terminus to Castletown, but it was found that half a railway made twice the loss. The government sponsored a short extension of the service from Castletown to Ballasalla in 1976, and, after extensive campaigning during the 1976 Tynwald elections, the railway returned to Douglas in 1977, the last year in which the railway was operated by the IMR. Following nationalisation the railway has continued to be operated seasonally, for many years from Easter weekend until the end of September, more recently from around 1 March to early November. Ownership Viewed from the steps of the signal box (l-r) No. 13 Kissack, No. 12 Hutchinson and No. 17 Viking at Douglas railway station in July 2006. Formed in 1870 with the first line following three years later, the Isle of Man Railway Company operated services until 1977 (see below) merging with the Manx Northern Railway and Foxdale Railway in 1905. The railway is now marketed as the Steam Railway to differentiate it from the Manx Electric Railway, operated by the same department. It was marketed as \\"Isle of Man Railway\\" until closure in 1965. From 1969 to 1972, it operated as the Isle of Mann Victorian Steam Railway Company Limited, reverting to Isle of Man Railway. When nationalised in 1978 it fell under the banner of \\"Isle of Man Railways\\", along with the Manx Electric Railway. Re-branding to Isle of Man Passenger Transport took place from 1984 but the steam line was not affected, and this reverted to Isle of Man Railways from 1990, when a re-branding exercise took place with the emphasis on the Victorian origins of the railway. A change in management style occurred in 1999, and trains, trams and buses were presented as Isle of Man Transport. The electric railway was affected more by this change, with a series of non-historical and modern liveries, but in 2007 this was changed and the railway is marketed once more as the Isle of Man Railway. In keeping with the historical aspect, coaches and locomotives carry original names and transfers. The banner heading of all the railways was again changed in 2009 and became collectively known as Isle of Man Heritage Railways, although the \\"heritage\\" tag has been dropped latterly. Joint timetabling with the Manx Electric Railway sees the line titled as the Steam Railway in marketing material. South Line described Boarding, Douglas railway station (2008) Entering Port St Mary railway station (1988) Today's railway is a fraction of its original size: it once served the western town of Peel, the northern town of Ramsey and the small mining village of Foxdale. Since 1969 only the southern line has been operational. Although it is only about half of its former size, Douglas railway station is still an impressive complex. After crossing the River Douglas, the line climbs the two-and-a-half- mile-long 1-in-65 Nunnery Bank through a wide rock cutting that brings it through a large estate, and past an industrial estate to the White Hoe, where the island's largest brewery is passed on the left of the train before crossing the first bridge. The train continues to climb to Port Soderick, just before which passengers get the first view of the sea at Keristal, before descending into the railway station. The train then passes through Crogga Woods, under another bridge at Meary Veg (centre for the island's sewage treatment works) and climbs, reaching its summit (,https://www.gov.im/media/1346324/iomsteamrailway_windowgazerguide_aw.pdf Isle of Man Steam Railway Window Gazer Guide marked by a board visible from the train) close to the site of Ballacostain Halt. The train descends to Santon, the only intermediate station in substantially original condition. From here the train descends at 1 in 60 to Ballasalla railway station, with interesting sea-cliff views to the east. Regular service trains formerly passed each other here. After Ballasalla the line runs over relatively flat land past the request halt at Ronaldsway to the ancient capital of Castletown. After Castletown the railway crosses the Silver Burn and heads northwest across country to the diminutive request stop at Ballabeg railway station. It then turns west for the short run to Colby, which is popular with the locals. After a request stop at the Level the train continues to Port St Mary, with views of Bradda Head and Milner's Tower on this stretch of line to Port Erin. Port Erin railway station is home to the Whistle Stop Cafe, providing light refreshments, and the Isle of Man Railway Museum, established in 1975 with two locomotives and rolling stock including the Queen's Coach and Governor's Saloon from the opening of the line in 1873. The majority of the line runs through countryside, with only small stretches close to built-up areas. Many people start or end their journey in Port Erin, a Victorian seaside resort, or in Castletown, the ancient capital. Ronaldsway Halt, between Ballasalla and Castletown, is a few hundred yards' walk from the airport. There are several farm crossings and rural request stops, which largely serve adjoining fields and local communities, especially on the southernmost section which passes through agricultural land. The line passes along the southern plain after traversing the more hilly landscape north of Ballasalla. Post- nationalisation Ballasalla station (1998) No. 12 Hutchinson shunts onto her train at Port Erin (2008) When the railway was nationalised in 1978 Bill Jackson was appointed the first manager. During his time in office much progress was made, not all liked by the preservationists and supporters: negative developments overshadowing his tenure included the loss of the large railway yard at Douglas and the unpopular rebuild of No. 12 locomotive Hutchinson. Upon his retirement in 1987 he was replaced by Robert Smith, whose style was totally different and who made many changes. Smith masterminded the Year of Railways in 1993 and the celebrations that followed. Rolling stock returned to original \\"purple lake\\" livery and No.s 10, 15 and 1 (in that order) were returned to service. When he resigned in 1999 he was replaced by David Howard, with previous bus experience at various UK operators and rail experience from his time at Tyne and Wear Metro. He was more inclined to a corporate approach and the railway had to follow suit. His time in office, finishing in 2006, will be remembered for the thrust on health and safety issues, such as high-visibility clothing and warning signs, as part of a Government-wide drive. The government commissioned a study to see if it would be worthwhile to operate commuter services to help relieve the road traffic congestion in and around Douglas, and although experimental services were implemented in 2007, these operate only during T.T. race periods. The study recommended against such development. Nevertheless, almost all the line was relaid in the first few years of this century as part of the Department of Transport's IRIS sewerage scheme, with all but one of the numerous level crossings converted from manual to automatic operation, saving the cost of employing crossing keepers. After Howard resigned, the Department of Tourism and Leisure's Director of Leisure, Mike Ball, stepped in as acting director of public transport, and in early 2007 the leisure and public transport divisions of the department combined into \\"service delivery\\", Ball becoming \\"Director of service delivery\\" under the minister Adrian Earnshaw appointed in November 2006. Ian Longworth was appointed Director of Public Transport in 2009 and since then the railway has become part of the Department of Community, Culture and Leisure. A number of new services have been introduced since the arrival of the new director, including evening excursion trains, a Rush Hour event at the start of each season, and family-oriented events including a \\"Teddy Bears' Picnic\\" and \\"Fathers' Day\\" specials. A restoration programme for the unique collection of rolling stock and locomotives is ongoing; this has seen most recently two saloon-type coaches completely rebuilt and back in traffic; at least three more coaches are to be restored, one of which has been out of traffic for nearly half a century. Locomotives Douglas station (2009) All but one of the railway's distinctive locomotives were built by Beyer, Peacock and Company of Manchester between 1873 and 1926, with 16 steam locomotives in total. As of March 2020 there are nominally three locomotives in traffic: No. 8 Fenella, No. 13 Kissack and No. 15 Caledonia. In addition, No. 11 Maitland is undergoing a long-term rebuild, whilst No. 4 Loch and No. 10 G. H. Wood are both undergoing overhaul. The Isle of Man Railway Museum is home to No. 1 ‚Äò‚ÄôSutherland‚Äô‚Äô of 1873 and No. 6 Peveril of 1875, with other locomotives at various locations. Only No. 2 Derby has been lost, with only the frames of No. 7 Tynwald in existence, privately owned off-island. The railway also possesses two diesel locomotives: No. 17 Viking which was withdrawn in 2010 and No. 21 Vignoles, a diesel electric locomotive delivered in December 2013. A number of smaller shunting locomotives and people carriers for departmental use also exist. Carriages Douglas station (2010) About 30 carriages remain on the railway, of which 18 are in service, two in the Isle of Man Railway Museum, and the rest in storage. Several vehicles were sold off-island in 1975 for preservation, and at least one has been preserved privately on the island. Over 12 out-of-use carriages were lost in a fire that engulfed the large carriage shed at St John's in 1975, and more were damaged beyond economic repair, including most of the remaining Manx Northern six- wheelers. There is an ongoing maintenance programme for returning coaches to traffic, which saw two saloon coaches completely rebuilt and returned to traffic in 2011, with a further two in 2012. In the winter of 2013, a replica of Empress Van F.27 was built on a steel underframe as a kitchen to work with the saloons as a dining train. Significant work was also done on the Cardinal's Coach F.35, which is used as the bar carriage, and the other saloons have being converted recently to dining cars seating 66 in total, giving the six saloon set as of 2015. Operation The IMR has always had a marked seasonal pattern in traffic. Services evolved around two main considerations: the need to connect with ferries to and from the UK and Ireland, and to transport day trippers out of the major termini. The railway never evolved appreciable commuter traffic, so local traffic tended to revolve around shopping, attending markets, and trips to \\"Town\\". When the Isle of Man and Manx Northern Railways opened between 1873 and 1879, the basic service on all three main routes consisted of four or five trains a day. The first departures were timed to arrive in Douglas just before 08:30 to connect with the morning ferries to the UK. The trains returned from Douglas shortly after 09:00, crossing the second inbound trains of the day en route. All three routes then had a late morning/lunchtime, and late afternoon trains in both the up and down directions, with the day's service ending with an early evening departure from Douglas. The February 1878 timetable shows departures from Douglas to Peel at 09:00, 11:00, 14:15, 17:15 and 19:40, and to Port Erin at 08:30, 10:10, 14:10, 17:00, and 19:35. From Peel to Douglas trains departed at 07:40, 10:05, 13:00, 16:00, and 18:30, and from Port Erin at 07:20, 09:50, 12:30, 15:40, and 18:20. This rather basic service tended to increase until after World War Two: seven trains each way on the three main routes was the usual winter timetable in the 1920s and 30s. From 1886 to 1940, the Foxdale branch was served by up to four round trips on weekdays from St John's. Additional trains were added to the basic service at Easter and again at Whitsun. The high season timetable usually came into effect on the first Monday of July, or immediately following Tynwald Day (July 5). This often stretched the railway's resources to the limit. At its height in the 1920s, the railway was carrying well over a million passengers a year. In this timetable there were up to 15 round trips on the Peel and Port Erin lines, and up to 14 on the Ramsey line, with even Foxdale seeing a half dozen trains each day. In 1927, during the \\"Bus War\\", the IMR boasted that it ran \\"100 trains a day at pre-war prices.\\" =1930s and WW2= In the 1930s, following the integration of train and bus services, the summer train service was trimmed to about a dozen trains each way on all three main routes. This intensive service ran on an entirely single-track system controlled by staff and ticket safeworking, with limited semaphore signalling. As the UK's 1889 Railways Act did not apply on the island, there were no signal interlockings except at Douglas and St John's, though limited interlocking in the form of slot detectors was fitted at passing loops from 1927 onwards. Continuous vacuum brakes were not fitted until 1925‚Äì27. In spite of this the railway has seen very few serious accidents (see below). During World War II, the usual winter timetable of seven or eight trains each way a day on all three main routes between 07:00 and 20:00 ran throughout. However, as the number of servicemen on the island increased, additional late trains were run on Fridays and Saturdays: the last arrivals in Port Erin, Peel, and Ramsey were often around midnight. Military requirements led to a large number of special trains being run, some of them in the small hours of the morning, which led to some minor mishaps. Foxdale passenger services ceased in 1940, but the branch was heavily used for spoil trains during the construction of Jurby and Ronaldsway aerodromes. =Post war= Traffic levels remained very high in the late 1940s due to rationing, but the 1948 Howden Report foresaw the eventual closure of both the Ramsey and Peel lines, with goods services transferred to road transport. The brief post-war resurgence of the Manx tourist industry kept the trains well filled into the mid-1950s, and postponed the day when significant economies and modernisation would be required. From 1955 onwards usage declined sharply; a million passengers were carried for the last time in 1957. By then the high season schedule had been reduced to seven round trips to Port Erin, and five each on the Peel and Ramsey lines. However individual trains, such as the boat trains, and the 10:35 to Port Erin could load very heavily: 9 carriages and almost 500 passengers on a single train was common in high season. The last re-boilering before the 1965 closure took place in 1959; by then the active fleet had been reduced to 11 locomotives from the 16 of 1939 by the withdrawal of No.s 7, 2, 9, 4, and 3. Locos 1, 6, 13, 14 and 16 were known to have limited lives left on their existing boilers, so the future looked grim. Although the railway was still intensively used in summer, winter train services had been reduced to morning and afternoon round trips to Port Erin and Peel, and a solitary working to Ramsey. These trains operated mainly for parcels traffic, and were run at a considerable loss. Winter trains usually consisted of a locomotive and one or two carriages. The St John's - Peel section closed for the winter of 1960, reopening the following Easter, whilst in 1961-65 the St John's to Ramsey service was withdrawn for the winter months, after the long-established Kirk Michael to Ramsey school trains were replaced by buses. From 1962 the ex-County Donegal railcars handled most of the winter service; they were used between Douglas and Peel in the summer. The last two summer timetables reflect the tourism of the mid-1960s. These show six round trips on the Port Erin line, three to five on the Peel line, and two to Ramsey. Except for the Port Erin-Douglas boat train July and August, all trains operated between 09:30 and 17:30: quite a contrast with the 15 or 16 hours-a-day operation of the 1920s and 1930s. Almost the whole of the Peel line service was handled by the ex-Donegal Railcars, allowing the remaining steam locomotives to be divided between the South Line and the service to Ramsey. In June 1967 Ailsa issued an ambitious summer timetable that pushed a reduced locomotive fleet to its limit, leaving no contingency in the event of failure, as by now only five Beyer Peacock steam locomotives and the railcars were available for service. The timetable was modified by mid-August to four round trips to Castletown (unchanged), three to Peel (down from 7) and two to Ramsey. This pattern carried over to the 1968 season, except that the Ramsey service was reduced to one train thrice-weekly by the end of the season. =Closure of Peel and Ramsey lines= Since the closure of the Peel and Ramsey lines, the basic service has generally been four trains a day between Douglas and Port Erin and return, at roughly two-hour intervals between 10:00 and 16:.00. In most seasons an extra train has operated from Douglas around 10:45 during July and August, returning from Port Erin at about 15.30. A brief 1990s experiment of six trains each way in high season was abandoned on grounds of cost. In the 2012, 2013, and 2014 seasons, a six train service has again been run in high season. The service in 2012 followed the conventional pattern of a third locomotive and third set of carriages providing additional departures at 10:50 and 14:50 from Douglas, and 12:50 and 16:50 from Port Erin; but in 2013, a third locomotive was used to shorten turn around times at Douglas, and trains departed at 90-minute intervals through the day. This allowed the use of only two rakes of carriages for the scheduled service, allowing the saloons to be reserved for excursion and charter trains. In the period 1945‚Äì1965 most trains consisted of two and three-carriage sets hauled by a single locomotive. Each three-car set consisted of a brake third or brake-composite, a first-third composite, and a luggage-brake-third, with two car sets omitting the either the brake-composite, or the luggage-brake-third. Three car sets had seats for 120 third class, 12 first class; two car sets carried up to 60 third and 12 first class passengers. Additional carriages - usually older stock such as \\"the Pairs\\" and \\"small Fs\\" - were added when loadings increased in mid-summer. The official maximum loading for a single locomotive was seven carriages until 1977, when it was reduced to six (SRN Spring 1978). However, during locomotive shortages a single Medium Boiler locomotive sometimes handled eight or nine carriages on Port Erin trains, banked as far as Keristal by the Douglas station pilot. Peel and Ramsey trains were usually combined between Douglas and St John's. These trains were often double-headed, usually to balance locomotive workings rather than on account of loading. Apart from the Ramsey Cattle Mart specials and the transport of materials for projects such as the completion of an airfield in the north of the island, freight trains rarely operated. Most freight was conveyed by attaching freight wagons, loose coupled, to the rear of passenger trains. This practice was contrary to UK regulations, but legal on the Isle of Man. The consequent shunting often delayed passenger trains at intermediate stations, but was cost effective for the railway. A miscommunication while detaching a van from a Douglas train at Union Mills was a contributory factor to the 22 August 1925 accident at Douglas. Freight traffic ceased in the 1960s, as road transport was much more effective over the island's short distances. Ailsa's manager, Sir Philip Wombwell, did try to bring container traffic to the railway in 1967/8 and stripped 12 carriages from the F50-75 series of the bodies to act as container flats. The experiment proved unsuccessful as clearance issues prevented containers being carried north of Douglas, and the double transshipment of containers at Castletown - from ship to lorry and from lorry to train - made the traffic uneconomic. Some of the underframes from this project eventually found their way to the Ffestiniog Railway, where they were placed on two foot gauge bogies and used as the basis for some of the \\"Barn\\" carriages running on the FR. Far more successful was a contract to haul oil between Peel and Milntown (near Ramsey) for the Electricity Board. Three 'M' series wagons were fitted with tanks, and the oil was worked as tail traffic until passenger trains ceased in September. The service continued through the winter of 1968/9, but was abandoned in May 1969 following the decision to close the Peel and Ramsey lines. Timetabling Summer 1972 timetable =1873‚Äì1966= The railway operated a modest local train service throughout the year, which was considerably augmented during the summer months to accommodate tourist traffic. Traffic was driven by three requirements: the need to connect with the ferries to and from Britain and Ireland, on-island transportation for tourists, and local passenger traffic. It was common for three or four timetables to be produced each year reflecting seasonal trends, and these would be published in the local newspapers. Winter traffic declined sharply after the 1920s, but it was not until 1960 that the railway was effectively \\"closed\\" for spells during the winter, with services only operating on certain days mainly for parcels traffic. This continued until November 1965 when the railway was closed \\"for essential maintenance to take place\\". No trains ran in 1966 but the following year it reopened on a seasonal basis as a tourist attraction as detailed above. =1967‚Äì1968= The entire network was leased by Archibald Kennedy, 7th Marquess of Ailsa and the lines reopened on 3 June 1967 operating an intensive service, especially on the Peel Line, until September; the following year saw a reduced timetable of operation but proved to be the final year of the lines serving Peel and Ramsey. This has become known as the Ailsa Period known for the change of livery to spring green carried by the locomotives. The timetables utilised the Peel and Port Erin lines heavily whilst there was no service to Ramsey on certain days, and then only a limited service ran. =1969‚Äì1972= From 1969 only the southern route to Port Erin was operated. Services generally operated from May to September thereafter still under the auspices of Lord Ailsa; the former lines remained in situ but disused, save for occasional stock movements to the carriage shed at St John's for the winter storage of rolling stock. A limited oil tanker service operated only in 1969. At this time the now traditional pattern of four trains each way per day was adopted and it is this pattern of operation that broadly speaking remains in place today. =1973‚Äì1974= Lord Ailsa took his five-year option on a 21-year lease and relinquished duties to operate trains from the close of the 1972 season and the Railway Company again took over services with subsidy from the Isle of Man Tourist Board. The centenaries of the Peel and Port Erin lines were commemorated with special trains on the anniversary days in these two years. Services continued to operate on the four each way per day pattern with additional services at peak times in the summer months to coincide with island events. =1975‚Äì1977= In a cost-cutting measure, trains only operated between Port Erin and Castletown in 1975, and Port Erin and Ballasalla in 1976. The line to Douglas was still maintained as locomotives and rolling stock returned there to receive maintenance. There was much political controversy over the short-line workings and services were ultimately restored in 1977 although rails were lifted on the closed sections during this time. 1977 proved to be the final year of Railway Company operation of the line, again on a familiar seasonal basis with four trains each way per day between May and September. =1978‚Äì1986= Various timetables were experimented with in the early period of nationalisation; Notable in this period were the Friday only Winter Shoppers trains which ran during the 1981-1982 and 1983-1983 winter periods, with only one train from Port Erin and return each day. Generally trains operated for Easter Week and the full season began at the end of May to coincide with the annual T.T. race period and ran until the last weekend of September. Aside from the popular Santa Trains, which have operated since 1985 the line remained closed in the winter months. Also of note are the shuttle services which operated between Douglas and the country park at Lough Ned (mid-way to Port Soderick), these ran in peak season and often utilised the railcars; a platform was provided for this service which saw the last regular use of the railcars in passenger service. =1987‚Äì1999= Trains operated for Easter Week with the main season running from mid-May each year; from 1987 trains ran seven days a week in this period (previously there had been no Saturday service for several years) and many additional and extra timetables ran for the Year of Railways in 1993, the International Railway Festival in 1995 and Steam 125 event in 1998. Certain years also saw skeleton services operating in October and November in conjunction with various off-season attractions on the island, although the pattern of passing trains at Ballasalla was adhered to. A familiar pattern during this period was the operation of an additional train on Mondays-Thursdays in July and August which left Douglas mid morning (10:50) and returned from Port Erin at 17:30, utilising the long-closed station at Port Soderick to pass the regular service trains. It was common for a shuttle service to link Port Erin and Castletown during the closure of the Billown Circuit for racing during this time. =2000‚Äì2009= The season was extended so that a daily service also operated during October half term with a three- week closure from the end of September. During this time certain seasons saw trains passing at Castletown rather than the more traditional Ballasalla. There was major disruption to services from 2000 when a sewer pipe was laid beneath the railway seeing short line workings from Douglas to Santon, and various shuttles between Port Erin, Port St Mary and Castletown over three seasons before the full line was reinstated. A courtesy coach for passenger bridging the gap of the closed sections was laid on during this period. The extra peak season train was dropped during this period and only four departures from either termini was the standard operational procedure. From 2007 a commuter service operated during the T.T. period, in the first two years this also ran for Manx Grand Prix week. =2010‚Äì2014= The season now extends until the first weekend of November to tie in with the Ride The Rocket Bonfire Night service and schools' half term. Various timetables that operate at different times of the season, with the peak version seeing three train sets in service and six departures from each termini, the last one at approximately 19:00 from Douglas, returning from Port Erin at 21:00 - depending on the operating pattern. Special event days often see bespoke timetables with additional services often providing shuttle services to intermediate stations, usually Ballasalla and Castletown, although Port St Mary has also been served by these shuttles. On peak days such as the annual Rush Hour event, the service intensity is reminiscent of the Edwardian era with up to eleven trains each way operating over the 16 mile route. =2015-2019= From the start of the 2015 season on 12 February, the passing loop was moved from Ballasalla to Castletown. The railway's new dining train often operates out of season, commonly travelling only as far as Santon, Ballasalla or Castletown before returning to Douglas. There are two basic timetables, the traditional four each way per day for the bulk of the season, with a six train service in peak season. In addition, evening trains operate on Thursdays in July and August, and commuter services continue to operate for the T.T. race period. A new initiative also sees the Commuter Club train which runs on the first Friday of each operating month departing Port Erin at 07:45 and returning from Douglas at 17:45 using the railway's dining train. The 2016 timetable followed a similar pattern to the previous year, the notable alteration being the ex-Port Erin services departing five minutes earlier than previously scheduled, commencing on 5 March and running until early November. The 2017 season commenced on 18 March with a timetable broadly following the pattern of the previous season with the addition of a schedule operating on Sundays in August to accommodate regular dining services. =2020 (Covid-19)= Services commenced as usual on 6 March following a similar pattern to previous years with two trains in operation five days a week (no services on Tuesdays and Wednesdays). However the railway closed after the last trains on 19 March owing to COVID-19; there were only occasional works trains operating in connection with track repairs. From 23 July services resumed on the standard timetable, with all trains crossing at Castletown, but operating only from Thursdays to Sundays (as well as the August bank holiday). Services are expected to end on 13 September, whereas the season would ordinarily conclude at the start of November. Locomotives available were No.8, No.13 and Caledonia, while work continued on the rebuild of No.4. A selection of dining services also operate commencing on 30th July. Use in film The earliest use of the railway as a backdrop for filming purposes appears to have been in 1946 when I See A Dark Stranger used Union Mills station in the opening scenes, doubling as a station in Ireland. The Isle of Man was one of the locations for the movie Thomas and the Magic Railroad when Castletown station became Shining Time station while the goods shed at Port Erin became Burnett Stone's workshop, containing a replica of Lady, although the trains themselves were not used during production. Other locations were used to represent the entrance to Burnett's workshop (an old lead mine) and the entry to the Magic Railroad (near the old lead mine), and a workshop in Port Erin was used to store properties, presumably including the Lady replica. The railway has also been used during the filming of The Brylcreem Boys using on- board views and Douglas station, Five Children & It for which Castletown station was fitted with a temporary canopy and given period set dressing, Channel 4's production of Cinderella that saw Santon station used heavily, the BBC adaptation of The Ginger Tree in which it doubled for communist Russia using the carriage shed at Douglas, lineside scenes and Castletown station (No. 11 Maitland was painted matte black for this production and remained in this guide for the remainder of the 1989 season) as well as being the subject of a 1988 BBC documentary as part of the Train Now Departing... series in an episode called \\"Steam in the Isle Of Man\\". Other television credits include an adaptation of The Legend Of The Tamworth Two, the television movie Stiff Upper Lips and the long-running travelogue show Wish You Were Here...? which featured Sir Norman Wisdom. Events One-off and special events have been expanded from 2009 with further expansion in 2010 to include several now- annual initiatives, with the focus on the local market and families rather than the less lucrative enthusiasts' market which has tailed off since the expansive events beginning with the 1993 Year of Railways and beyond.

This group was known by this name because the advocates of this tradition were based in the city of Antioch, one of the major cities of the ancient Roman Empire. While the Christian intellectuals of Alexandria emphasized the allegorical interpretation of Scriptures and tended toward a Christology that emphasized the union of the human and the divine, those in Antioch held to a more literal and occasionally typological exegesis and a Christology that emphasized the distinction between the human and the divine in the person of Jesus Christ. The school in general tended to what might be called, in a rather loose sense, an Adoptionist Christology. Nestorius, before becoming Patriarch of Constantinople, had also been a monk at Antioch and had there become imbued with the principles of the Antiochene theological school. Periods The school of Antioch is best divided into three periods: =The early school (170-early fourth century)= The earliest author known of this period is Theophilus of Antioch. Then there is a gap of a century and in the first half of the fifth century there are three known antiochene authors: the best known is Eusebius of Emesa; other representatives are Acacius of Caesarea and Theodore bishop of Heraklea. =The middle school (350-433)= John Chrysostom (347 ‚Äì 407) This period includes at least three different generations: Diodorus of Tarsus, who directed an ·ºÄœÉŒ∫Œ∑œÑŒÆœÅŒπŒøŒΩ (school) he may have founded. Among his disciples, the best known are John Chrysostom and Theodore of Mopsuestia. The main figure of the third generation was Nestorius. =The late school (after 433)= After the Council of Ephesus (431), the School of Antioch lost some of its prestige. However, after the Council of Chalcedon (451), the Antiochian school became the sole theological school within Eastern and Western Christianity, where the Oriental Orthodox adopted the Alexandrian School of Theology. Apparently only two later authors are known: Basil of Seleucia and Gennadius of Constantinople.

A strong supporter of the orthodoxy of Nicaea, Diodore played a pivotal role in the Council of Constantinople and opposed the anti-Christian policies of Julian the Apostate. Diodore founded one of the most influential centers of Christian thought in the early church, and many of his students became notable theologians in their own right. Early life Diodore was born into a noble family in the area of Antioch. He received a classic philosophical education at the school of Athens, and very quickly after his education entered into the monastic life.Julian, Letters, 55. During this period, Diodore's work focused on philosophical treatises and opposing Emperor Julian's attempts to restore paganism in the empire. When an Arian named Leontius was made bishop of Antioch, Diodore and his friend Flavian (who later was himself appointed as bishop of Antioch) organized those who followed the Nicene orthodoxy outside the walls of the city for worship. Those services are seen as the beginning of antiphonal singing in the church, a practice that became widespread among Christians. During his time at the monastery in Antioch, Diodore came under the tutelage of Meletius of Antioch. Meletius was elected bishop in 360 and ordained Diodore as a priest. When the Antioch split into factions, Diodore, in turn, was a strong supporter of Meletius and of his move towards Nicene orthodoxy. Diodore was noted for living with few possessions, being dependent on alms for food, frequently being imprisoned on account of his beliefs. His physical appearance was rough, but Chysostom described his expression as angelic. Priesthood During his priesthood, Diodore founded a monastery and catechetical school near the city of Antioch. It was through this school that Diodore became the mentor of the controversial theologian and liturgist Theodore of Mopsuestia, but also of the legendary homileticist John Chrysostom.Socrates, Historia Ecclesiastica, 6.3Rowan A Greer, \\"Diodore of Tarsus,\\" in The Encyclopedia of Early Christianity, ed. Everett Ferguson, second edition (New York:Garland Publishing, 1997). This school would give rise to the unique Antiochene perspectives on both biblical interpretation and Christology known as the Antiochene School.Frederick W Norris, \\"Antioch\\" in The Encyclopedia of Early Christianity, ed. Everett Ferguson, second edition (New York:Garland Publishing, 1997). Ultimately, taken to the extreme, the perspective set out for this school by Diodore led to the teachings of Nestorius, which were first condemned at the First Council of Ephesus in 431. It was his role as the head of the Antiochene School which led to Diodore's exile in 372. Banished to Armenia by Emperor Valens, Diodore encountered a fellow supporter of the Nicene faction, Basil of Caesarea, during his exile.Catholic Encyclopedia, \\"Diodorus of Tarsus\\". When Diodore returned from exile following the death of the emperor in 378, Basil was serving as the archbishop (or patriarch) of Caesarea, and he appointed Diodore as the bishop of Tarsus. Episcopate As bishop of the see of Tarsus, Diodore continued to speak out for the Nicene understanding of the relationship between the human and the divine in the person of Jesus Christ. He actively opposed both the Arianism and the Apollinarianism of his day (Arius taught that Jesus Christ was not fully divine, Apollinaris of Laodicea spoke of the Incarnation in ways that left him open to the charge that Christ was not fully human). Diodore played key roles in both the local Council of Antioch (379) and the ecumenical First Council of Constantinople in 381. When their mentor Meletius died in 381, Diodore recommended his friend Flavian as his successor, thus prolonging the division in the Antiochene church.Norris, \\"Antioch\\". Diodore died around 394. Theology The Christology of Diodore was condemned as heretical by later generations, most explicitly at a local synod in Constantinople in 499 which described Diodore's views as Nestorian.J.N.D. Kelly, Early Christian Doctrines, revised ed, (San Francisco: HarperCollins, 1978) p. 302. Certainly, a similarly negative view of Diodore was held by Cyril of Alexandria. However, in his own generation Diodore was seen as someone who supported the orthodoxy of Nicaea, and in his official decree ratifying the actions of the First Council of Constantinople, Emperor Theodosius I described Diodore as a \\"champion of the faith.\\"Kelly, 302. The specifics of Diodore's theology are difficult to reconstruct, as all that remains of his works are fragments of uncertain provenance. What remains is fragments in the catenae on the Hexateuch and the Pauline Epistles. Recently a complete commentary on the Psalms has been discovered, which its editor ascribes to Diodore. Andrew Louth, 'John Chrysostom to Theodoret of Cyrrhus', in Frances Young, Lewis Ayres and Andrew Young, eds, The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature, (2010), p344Parry, Ken and David Melling (editors). The Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 1999. Much of Diodore's theology has been inferred from the later statements of his students and the intellectual heirs of the Antiochene School. According to the Universalist clergyman John Mather Austin (1855) Diodorus was also a Universalist since Saloman, Bishop of Bassorah in his Book of the Bee (1222) proclaimed the salvation of all men and cited the opinions of both Diodorus and Theodore of Mopsuestia in support of his view.Rev. J. M. Austin. \\"Brief History of Universalism \\". Ca. 1855. According to Universalist writer J. W. Hanson (1899) Diodorus believed that God's mercy would punish the wicked less than their sins deserved, inasmuch as his mercy gave the good more than they deserved and he denied that God would bestow immortality for the purpose of prolonging or perpetuating suffering.J.W. Hanson. Universalism: The Prevailing Doctrine Of The Christian Church During Its First Five Hundred Years. \\"Chapter 18 Additional Authorities \\".

He is considered by many to be the greatest footballer to ever play for Aston Villa Football Club and one of the greatest players to have played for England. As a manager he won the FA Cup with each of Sheffield Wednesday and Nottingham Forest, some 24 years apart, a record to this day. Playing career Walker was born in Wednesbury, Staffordshire. He joined Villa in 1914 and stayed at Villa Park for the rest of his playing career, retiring in 1934. He made 531 appearances for Villa between 1914 and 1934, scoring 244 goals, of which 214 came in 478 league matches. He remains Aston Villa's all-time top goalscorer to this day. He was an FA Cup Winner with Villa in 1920, and runner up in 1924. Walker is the only player to have scored a hat-trick of penalty kicks in a Football League game, doing so against Bradford City in November 1921. Walker played for England 18 times, scoring 9 goals. In March 2003, nearly 40 years after his death, he was named by BBC Sport as the former player Aston Villa needed in their modern-day team ‚Äì who were struggling for goals that season and narrowly avoided relegation from the FA Premier League (top flight of English football). Management =Sheffield Wednesday= He became manager of Sheffield Wednesday in December 1933, and he successfully steered them away from relegation. In 1935 he led them to an FA Cup victory, but Wednesday were relegated two years later and Walker resigned in November 1937. =Chelmsford City= On 24 January 1938, Walker was appointed secretary-manager of newly formed club Chelmsford City. Walker's first signings as Chelmsford manager included former England international Eric Keen, Ireland international Jackie Coulter and Jack Palethorpe, whom he had managed at Sheffield Wednesday. On 20 October 1938, Walker resigned from Chelmsford due to conflict with Chelmsford's directors over transfers. Walker had intended to sign a player from Plymouth Argyle for free, before discovering a ¬£500 fee was demanded, believing \\"that money was going to take a lot of finding\\" from the club. =Nottingham Forest= He managed Nottingham Forest from 1939 to 1960, bringing promotion to the First Division in 1956‚Äì57 and an FA Cup final triumph two years later (beating former team Aston Villa in the semi-finals), becoming the only manager to win the trophy both before and after the second World War.

It primarily sells hand- crafted stoneware tableware, kitchenware and serveware products including dinner sets, mugs and serving dishes, as well as a variety of glassware products and cast-iron cookware. History A Denby \\"neverdrip\\" teapot in blue, a design from the 1920s or 1930s The pottery at Denby was founded on the estate of William Drury-Lowe in 1809 as a manufacturer of stoneware bottles. It was run by Joseph Jager in partnership with Robert Charles George Brohier; the partnership was dissolved in 1814.The notice of dissolution refers to \\"the Partnership hereforeto carried on by the undersigned, Robert Charles George Brohier, and Joseph Jager, as Stone Bottle-Manufacturers, and otherwise, at a place called Jagersburgh, in the Parish of Denby, in the County of Derby, under the stile or firm of Brohier & Jager...\\" By this time, clay from a deposit on the land was already in use at the Belper Pottery. At the beginning of 1815 William Bourne of the Belper Pottery and his sons William, John and Joseph took a 21-year lease on Brohier and Jager's factory. Joseph Bourne ran the works at Denby and Belper in tandem until 1834, when he closed down the Belper pottery and moved its equipment and workforce to Denby. Bourne later took over the Codnor Park and Shipley Potteries, and merged them into the Denby works in a similar manner. Joseph Bourne took his son Joseph Harvey Bourne into partnership, and the company became known as Joseph Bourne and Son, a name it kept even after the death of Joseph Bourne in 1860. Using a new patent process for drying slip invented by Needham and Kite of Vauxhall, the pottery produced at least 25 tons of workable clay each day. In the nineteenth century most of the ware produced was salt-glazed stoneware. Bourne patented improved kilns for stoneware in 1823 and 1848. By the 1870s the pottery was producing a wide range of utilitarian stoneware products including telegraph insulators, ink bottles, pickle and marmalade jars, spirit and liquor bottles, foot warmers, churns, mortars and pestles, pipkins, feeding-bottles, pork pie moulds, druggists' shop-jars, snuff-jars, spirit-barrels, pudding-moulds, and water filters. They also made more decorative \\"hunting jugs\\" sprigged with moulded decorations of huntsmen, windmills, men smoking or beehives, sometimes with the handle in the form of a greyhound, and terracotta goods, both practical and decorative. Denbyware from the Blue Jetty range The company benefited greatly from its transport links into Derby and beyond, particularly when the Midland Railway opened its Ripley Branch. It had a siding at Denby Wharf (the terminus of the Little Eaton Gangway) approximately opposite to the factory. Each week around three or four vans would be dispatched to Chaddesden sidings (near Derby station) where they would be connected to an express to St Pancras in London and the company's warehouse at the Granary. The company, whose name is now principally associated with stoneware, initially produced bottles and jars, before specialising in kitchenware and, eventually, in tableware, for which it is best known today. In order to increase capacity the nearby Langley Mill Pottery was acquired in October 1959. During the 1950s and 1960s a number of designers worked for Denby, including Gill Pemberton who designed the renowned and admired Denby Chevron, and Arabesque amongst others.Gill Pemberton Denby Interview C20 Ceramics 19 December 2016. Retrieved 09 July 2018. In 1987 the company was taken over by the Coloroll Group. After Coloroll went into receivership in 1990, Denby was subject to a management buyout, and was floated in 1994. In the early twenty-first century Denby expanded its use of materials to include glass (wine glasses, tumblers and bowls) and metal (cutlery and cooking utensils). It also introduced fine dining ranges in porcelain and bone china. The company was subject to a ¬£30 million management buyout in 2009, after suffering a decline in sales. The company had ¬£72 million of debt written off at the time of the buyout. In 2010 Denby acquired Burleigh Pottery in Stoke-on-Trent. Shortly afterwards in 2012, the Denby Group acquired Poole Potteryhttps://www.poolepottery.co.uk/pages/faqs. In February 2014, the company was put up for sale by its owner Hilco Capital following expressions of interest from other companies. Hilco cancelled the sale in January 2015 due to improvements in the company's growth. In 2019, Denby launched the Conscious Choice campaign which focused on the versatile, sustainable and functional nature of Denby's stoneware products and aimed to inspire customers to try and live more sustainably by reusing their pottery around the home.

Public John Q. Public (and several similar names; see the Variations section below) is a generic name in the United States, to denote a hypothetical member of society deemed a \\"common man.\\" It is presumed to represent the randomly selected \\"man on the street.\\" The equivalent term used in the United Kingdom is Joe Public. Variations There are various similar terms including John Q. Citizen and John Q. Taxpayer, or Jane Q. Public, Jane Q. Citizen, and Jane Q. Taxpayer for a woman. The name John Doe is used in a similar manner. The term Tom, Dick and Harry is often used to denote multiple hypothetical persons. An equivalent term is Joe Public which is used in the United Kingdom. Roughly equivalent are the names Joe Blow, Joe Six-pack, and the nowadays rather less popular Joe Doakes and Joe Shmoe, the last of which implies a lower-class citizen (from the Yiddish schmo: simpleton, or possibly Hebrew sh'mo: (what's)-his-name). On a higher plane, the Talmudic generic place-marker name Plony (which can be translated to Mr. X. or Anonymous) is used as a reference in any case which is applicable to anyone - Sanhedrin 43a provides an example. Usage In the United States, the term John Q. Public is used by law enforcement officers to refer to an individual with no criminal bent, as opposed to terms like perp (short for perpetrator) or skell to qualify unsavory individuals. 2008 Republican Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin infamously referred to \\"Joe Sixpack and Hockey moms\\" during a debate. Presidential candidate John McCain referenced a similar symbol, this time represented by an actual person, saying that Senator Obama's tax plan would hurt Joe the Plumber's bottom line. A fifteen-minute debate on this issue ensued, with both candidates speaking directly to \\"Joe\\". History John, Quisquam and \\"The Public\\" first appears in the formation of the United States as a nation where English and German were being discussed as the official language of the new United States in the later 1700s. Many new Americans of Lutheran German heritage also spoke Latin and used the term \\"quisquam\\" with a gender neutral meaning of \\"anyone\\" where, in English, John was the generic male term for a person. The term John Q. Public was the name of a character created by Vaughn Shoemaker, an editorial cartoonist for the Chicago Daily News, in 1922. Jim Lange, the editorial cartoonist for The Oklahoman for 58 years, was closely identified with a version of the John Q. Public character,Longtime cartoonist Jim Lange dies, The Oklahoman, April 18, 2009. whom he sometimes also called \\"Mr. Voter\\". Lange's version of the character was described as \\"bespectacled, mustachioed, fedora- wearing\\".Goodbye, Jim: Our hats are off for 58-year cartoonist, The Oklahoman, April 19, 2009. In 2006 the Oklahoma State Senate voted to make this character the \\"state's official editorial cartoon.\\"Mr. Voter Tapped by Senate as State‚Äôs Official Editorial Cartoon, Oklahoma State Senate News, March 9, 2006 (retrieved May 25, 2009). Other English-speaking countries The equivalent in the United Kingdom is Joe (or Jane) Public, John Smith, or Fred Bloggs or Joe Bloggs. Also, the man in the street, the man on the Clapham omnibus, and the aforementioned Tom, Dick and Harry. Tommy or Tommy Atkins is used as a generic soldier's name. In Australia and New Zealand, John (or Jane) Citizen is usually seen as a placeholder in credit card advertisements, while Joe (or Jane) Bloggs is also commonly used in speech. Joe Blow is also used, often to suggest a possibly undesirable person. For example: \\"You left the door open so any Joe Blow could have walked in.\\" Also used: Fred Nurk, Joe Farnarkle. In Ireland Joe Soap is used as a generic reference to a male. Also Se√°n and S√≠le Citizen; Irish: Se√°n √ì Ruda√≠, from rud = thing(s). In Canada, during the 1960s, a person appeared in editorial cartoons called Uno Who, representing an average, downtrodden citizen. He was always shown wearing a bankruptcy barrel (as did Will Johnstone's earlier and similar character, \\"the Taxpayer\\", for the American New York World Telegram). Qu√©becers also use Monsieur-Madame- Tout-le-Monde (\\"Mr-and-Ms-Everybody\\") or Monsieur Untel (\\"Mr-So-and-so\\"). Jos Bleau (Joe Blow, spelled according to the rules of French) and G. Raymond are also used in Canada (George Raymond is a real person at VISA in Montr√©al, where the abbreviated name appears on example cards). Occasionally, names which are invariant when translated between English and French are favoured in advertising material (such as \\"Nicole Martin\\" or \\"Carole Martin\\" on packets of retail coupons).

It is long and is on average wide. It was constructed in the late 1990s and early 2000s to take overflow from the River Thames and so alleviate flooding to areas in and around the towns of Maidenhead, Windsor, and Eton in the counties of Berkshire and Buckinghamshire. It achieves this by taking water from the left (at this point eastern) bank of the Thames upstream of Boulter's Lock near Maidenhead and returning it via the north bank downstream of Eton.Environment Agency ‚Äì A map indicating the location and route of the Jubilee River Although successful in its stated aims, residents of villages downstream, such as Wraysbury, claim it has increased flooding. Construction Parts of the towns of Windsor, Eton and Maidenhead are prone to flooding, because they are built on the flood plain of the River Thames. The concept of a parallel channel which could take water from the Thames above Maidenhead and return it below Windsor was conceived in the 1980s, and became known as the Maidenhead, Windsor and Eton Flood Alleviation Scheme. When the ten regional water authorities were privatised, as a result of the Water Act 1989, responsibility for rivers passed to the National Rivers Authority, and soon after they were constituted they submitted plans for a channel which would be wide and long. In October 1992 a planning enquiry was held to consider the proposals. During that enquiry, P. Ackers, one of the assessors, expressed grave doubts about the hydraulic modelling that had been used to justify the scheme, suggesting that it was too optimistic. The scheme did not receive government approval until 1995; around the same time, there was further reorganisation of the water industry, with the Environment Agency replacing the National Rivers Authority. Although Mr Ackers' concerns had not been addressed, they commissioned the design and construction of the scheme as originally conceived, at a cost of ¬£110 million. Throughout the planning process, from initial feasibility studies to delivery of the project, Lewin, Fryer and Partners were the consulting engineers. Principal works were the creation of the channel, various flow control mechanisms and bridges for road, rail and foot traffic. Dorney Bridge One of the challenges was the Dorney Bridge, built to take the channel beneath the Great Western Railway line. The 19th-century Brunel-designed railway embankment continued in use, carrying passenger and goods trains between London and destinations including South Wales, Cornwall and Bristol throughout construction. The high embankment was stabilised along 30m of its length by freezing over a period of three months, using 175 brine tubes cooled to . A tunnel was excavated through the frozen ground to just wider than the two long preformed concrete box sections, which were jacked through as the excavation proceeded. This created a wide by high concrete culvert which can be seen from the Bath Road Bridge. Black Potts Viaduct The channel also had to be taken through Black Potts Viaduct, a series of 13 brick arches carrying the Waterloo to Windsor railway line over the Thames flood plain. Protective concrete and blue brick barriers were built around the older brickwork to preserve the viaduct's structural integrity, as well as to control gates to adjust the amount of water rejoining the Thames immediately downstream. The channel involved complex civil engineering to deal with utility conduits, roads and railways, as well as ecological and social issues, entailing compulsory purchases, community lectures and consultations and a public enquiry. For example at Manor Farm a weir was constructed. Conception to fruition took about twenty years. Water is admitted to the river through sluice gates at the upstream end of the channel near Taplow. This is normally controlled by measurements of the water levels below Boulters Lock and the estimated flow of the Thames at the Datchet gauging station near Windsor. The first serious test of the new structure occurred during the flooding of early January 2003, and revealed a number of defects in the design. With both the Boulters Lock levels and the Datchet flow indicating that the channel was needed, the Taplow sluices were opened briefly on 1 January, but were then shut again until 4 January, by which time the Boulters Lock levels were above the target levels, and the flow at Datchet was some 320 cubic metres per second, 140 cubic metres per second above the recommended flow. A subsequent investigation revealed that the Environment Agency had known there were defects in the channel since November 2002, and this had been a major factor in not operating it correctly. When flood water was admitted to the channel, the flows were well short of its designed maximum flow capacity, and yet there was significant erosion of the banks in several places. There was considerable erosion at the Taplow Sluice, due to the lack of a stilling basin; embankments at Marsh Lane were badly damaged; the weir at Manor Farm was bent in the middle; the protection on the downsteam face of Slough weir was swept away; and in Datchet, the Myrke embankment nearly collapsed. An independent assessment by the engineering consultancy WS Atkins identified that the actual capacity of the channel was around two-thirds of its design capacity, and factors affecting this were the banks being too low, the use of inappropriate materials, and failure to follow standard design criteria. A programme of repairs and upgrades to rectify the problems began, at a cost of ¬£3.5 million, and took until 2006 to complete. The Environment Agency sued their lead design consultants for recovery of the remedial costs, and were refunded ¬£2.75 million in an out-of-court settlement, after they admitted that the design and construction were sub-standard. Name The name used during planning was the \\"Maidenhead, Windsor and Eton Flood Alleviation Scheme\\" (MWEFAS). The choice of a name for the river was put to the local population in a poll. The result was a strong preference for 'Jubilee', as it was being completed in Queen Elizabeth's Golden Jubilee year of 2002 and one of the Queen's main residences is at Windsor Castle, in one of the three towns being protected by the scheme. In use On most analyses the Jubilee River looks and acts like a natural river. Its banks have artificially constructed wildlife habitats intended to replace those lost from the banks of the Thames during urban expansion in the 19th and 20th centuries. During construction of reed beds and of wet woodland were laid down and about 250,000 trees were planted. The river is well used by walkers, runners, swimmers, canoeists, wildlife enthusiasts and cyclists: a footpath combined with National Cycle Route 61 runs along virtually its entire length. A wide variety of bird life can be seen along the river, including green woodpeckers, cormorants, lapwing and red kites. During flooding in the early months of 2014, some residents of Ham Island (in Old Windsor) and Wraysbury said that the Jubilee River had increased the height of the flooded Thames in those villages which, along with much of the river upstream of London, saw water levels unprecedented since 1947. Wraysbury had also suffered significant flooding in 2003. The Environment Agency in the 2010s is undertaking a widening and dredging programme of Thames works to assist with downstream flows.

It rises as the River Pant in the northwest of the county, just east of Saffron Walden, and flows in a generally southeast direction to Bocking, near Braintree, via Great Sampford and Great Bardfield. At Bocking, it becomes the River Blackwater, and veers east to flow past Bradwell Juxta Coggeshall and Coggeshall. It then veers south, flowing past Kelvedon and Witham, before reaching Maldon. There, it veers east again and empties into the Blackwater Estuary, which in turn meets the North Sea at Mersea Island. The River Blackwater has two major tributaries: the River Brain, which meets it just south of Witham, and the River Chelmer, which meets it just east of Maldon. The lower reaches of the Chelmer, from Chelmsford, were canalised in the 1790s, and the navigation diverts water north of the Blackwater through Maldon before emptying into the Blackwater Estuary at Heybridge Basin. History One of the most famous Viking battles in Britain, the Battle of Maldon, took place directly beside the river in 991. The Vikings were successful in battle against the Anglo-Saxons, claiming victory in this Dark Age battle. The Blackwater was a source of fish and oysters for the town of Maldon during the Roman occupation. The remains of Saxon fish traps were discovered in the river in the 1990s. During the winter of 1776 the Blackwater froze from Maldon to Osea island, a distance of some four miles. The ice trapped fishing and cargo carrying vessels and blocked any imports of coal, oil, wool to Maldon. In 1793 the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation Company was formed by act of Parliament. Over the next four years, the company built a navigation from Chelmsford to meet the tidal estuary of the River Blackwater in Colliers Reach at the place that is today called Heybridge Basin (after the canal basin there). The burgers of the borough of Maldon refused to allow the canal to pass through their borough, so the company routed it just outside the borough boundary, which is why it ended up at Colliers Reach, rather than at Maldon. From Chelmsford, the navigation mainly followed the course of the River Chelmer until it reached Beeleigh, near Maldon. Then it followed the course of the River Blackwater to Heybridge, and from there via a canal to the sea lock at Colliers Reach. A weir connected the navigation to the tidal river Blackwater at Heybridge, where it powered a water mill. Heybridge mill was demolished after severe flooding in this area in 1953, but the mill house still stands. The river (known here as Heybridge Creek) was dammed between Heybridge Hall and Potman marsh in 1954 as part of a programme of flood defence improvements. Most of the water flowing down the River Blackwater nowadays flows over a weir at Beeleigh and along the tidal section of the Chelmer before rejoining the Blackwater at Heybridge Basin. In 1865 HM Government passed the Maldon Harbour Act authorized construction of a wharf on the west side of the southern end of Heybridge Creek on land belonging to the Great Eastern Railway Company, and improving the channels of the rivers Chelmer and Blackwater.UK Parliament: Maldon Harbour Act. (Essex Record Office ref: D/B 3/3/669). Ten thousand pounds were spent on widening, deepening and improving the river from the Fullbridge to just downriver from Herring's Point, near Heybridge Basin. After this, vessels had to pay a toll of 3 pence a ton if they were under 50 tons register or 6 pence a ton if they were over that.Fitch, Edward Arthur: Maldon and the River Blackwater. Gowers, 1895. A medieval 5-arched stone bridge over the River Blackwater at Heybridge (from which that village got its name) was replaced in 1870 by a 2-arched brick one. That bridge was at the north end of the Causeway, at its junction with Heybridge Street and Holloway Road, but the bridge there now is hardly distinguishable as such. Industry The Maldon Crystal Salt Company produces crystalline sea salt by traditional panning techniques from the waters of the Blackwater. Osea Island Osea Island, in the Blackwater Estuary Osea Island is situated on the Blackwater Estuary, north of Steeple. Northey Island Northey Island owned by the National Trust, is approximately one mile to the west of Osea Island. It is part of an ancient landscape and is connected to the shore by a tidal causeway. It is believed by some to have been the site of the Battle of Maldon in 991 AD and offers birdwatching opportunities.

Early life  Yablans was born to a Jewish familyWashington Post: \\"Frank Yablans - 'Someone Has To Play the Heavy'\\" by Gary Arnold March 19, 1978 in Brooklyn, New York to Annette and Morris Yablans. His father was a Brooklyn cab driver. His older brother is film producer Irwin Yablans of Halloween (1978) fame.  Career  Yablans entered the motion picture business in 1956 joining Warner Bros. sales force. In 1959, he joined Buena Vista as the Milwaukee sales manager where he stayed until 1966. He joined Sigma III and later transitioned to Filmways after they acquired Sigma III. He became Executive Vice President of Sales for Paramount Pictures in June 1969. In that position, his expert marketing of the film Love Story (1970) led to his appointment as Paramount Studios' President on May 10, 1971. As head of Paramount, he oversaw the release of such classic movies as The Godfather (1972), The Godfather Part II (1974), and Chinatown (1974). He also personally supervised the 100th birthday celebrations of studio founder Adolph Zukor in January 1973. Seven weeks after Barry Diller moved above him as chairman and chief executive office of Paramount in September 1974, Yablans announced his resignation as president on November 8, 1974, taking effect from January 5, 1975. Following the end of his presidency, he became an independent producer, working primarily through Paramount and 20th Century Fox. He was executive producer of such films as Silver Streak (1976), The Other Side of Midnight (1977), Congo (1995), and the popular HBO series \\"Rome.\\" He also wrote and produced North Dallas Forty (1979) and Mommie Dearest (1981), the latter winning the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screenplay. Yablans was then recruited by Kirk Kerkorian to head his troubled and debt-laden film company, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). While Yablans' reorganization of MGM and United Artists (UA) into a single entity as MGM/UA served to reduce costs and overhead, the company continued to lose value and in 1986 was purchased by Ted Turner Productions for a reported $1.25 billion. In 2003, Yablans founded Promenade Pictures, a production company committed to the production of \\"family-friendly\\" entertainment, with their most ambitious project the \\"Epic Stories of the Bible\\" series of CGI-animated features, inaugurated with The Ten Commandments (2007) and Noah's Ark: The New Beginning (2012).  Death  Yablans died on Thanksgiving, November 27, 2014, from natural causes at the age of 79. He had three children - Robert Yablans (deceased), Sharon Abrams, and Edward Yablans - and a long-time companion, Nadia Pandolfo.

E. Sawyer (January 24, 1860 - September 23, 1924), was a homeopathic physician who was the longtime personal doctor to U.S. President Warren G. Harding and First Lady Florence Kling Harding. Sawyer is often blamed in the matter of Harding's death in 1923. Education and private practice Sawyer was born in Wyandot, Ohio and raised in Nevada, Ohio, in Wyandot County, the eldest of six children and only one to survive to adulthood. He married May Elizabeth Barron (1859‚Äì1945). He died in Marion County, Ohio. Sawyer had one son, Carl, born in 1881.Anthony 1998, p. 66 Sawyer was an 1881 graduate of the Cleveland Homeopathic Hospital College, Cleveland, Ohio, earning his degree in homeopathy, and began his practice outside of LaRue, Ohio in western Marion County, Ohio. Following a brief period in Indianapolis, the Sawyers returned to Marion in 1895 where Dr. Sawyer began the construction of a modern sanatorium for the treatment of medical and emotional maladies.Anthony 1998, p. 65 This building was built in three stages and is currently located on South Main Street in Marion, Ohio; the building is currently known as the Elite (E-light) Apartments. Sawyer also operated the Parkview Sanatorium in Columbus, Ohio under the corporate name of \\"Ohio Sanatorium Company\\". He also became the director of the Marion National Bank and president of the Marion Masonic Temple Company. Sawyer was also a director of the Marion Commercial Club. He was an atheist. In the early years of the 20th century, Sawyer expanded his practice with the construction of the White Oaks Sanatorium immediately south of Marion, Ohio. The sanatorium's name was derived from the White Oaks Farm, which the Sawyers purchased and used as the location of their new facility. White Oaks was a compound of buildings which enclosed a courtyard. Buildings included patient wards, called cottages, which were located inside the cloister. Buildings ringing the outside of the cloister included a Nurses dormitory, administrative offices, dining hall for patients who were ambulatory, sterile surgery, physical rehabilitation building, facilities for dental work and doctors offices. It was here, in Rose Cottage, that former First Lady Florence Kling Harding spent time near the end of her life. She then returned to live in Sawyer's former home at 1201 Bellefontaine Avenue in Marion, where she died in November 1924. The home on Bellefontaine Avenue was destroyed by fire on August 19, 2010. White Oaks institution continued to operate until the late 1960s. The site is now known as Sawyer Ludwig Park and is operated by the Marion, Ohio Department of Parks and Recreation. Dr. Sawyer's relationship with the family of Warren G. Harding‚Äôs parents began when Sawyer stepped forward to save the reputation of Harding‚Äôs mother, Dr. Phoebe Dickerson Harding. Harding‚Äôs mother had been caring for a sick child and provided a prescription for the child, which unknown to her also contained an opiate; the child died from the drug. Sawyer stepped forward to validate Phoebe Harding‚Äôs diagnosis and treatment, thus saving her career. President Harding's death Sawyer at the White House in 1923 Sawyer acted as the personal physician to Warren G. Harding and to Florence Harding as well. He never accepted payment from them for his services; in doing so he felt that he provided himself a level of protection in the event that either died while under his care. Sawyer diagnosed and successfully treated Mrs. Harding‚Äôs \\"floating kidney\\" condition, the first doctor to do so, and thus gained her loyalty. Harding gave Sawyer the rank of Brigadier General in the Army Medical Corps. Sawyer's reliance on dated medical practices resulted in the misdiagnosis of the President's coronary condition that led to the President's death in San Francisco in 1923. Joel Boone, M.D., the Vice Admiral in the United States Naval Medical Corps, had diagnosed the condition while Harding was on tour in Alaska. Sawyer deferred to the attending physician; however, Harding insisted on finishing the trip. It has even been speculated that Sawyer's use of harsh purgatives was the cause of Harding's fatal heart attack. The nursing notes from President Harding's medical records do not support this contention. Harding died of congestive heart failure and suffered a fatal heart attack. Harding's medical records from the western trip (the six-week trip during which he died) exist, and they show a man suffering from high blood pressure, chest pains, respiratory discomfort, indigestion, etc. Cardiac medicine was in its infancy, and these very recognizable symptoms to us were not automatic signals then for an impending catastrophic event. At Sawyer's recommendation, Mrs. Harding did not have an autopsy performed. Following the President's death, Sawyer resigned his commission, and focused his attention on the formation of the Harding Memorial Association, to which the task of designing and building the Harding Memorial in Marion fell. Sawyer died within a month of the announcement that a location had been secured, which delayed completion of the marble memorial until December 1927. The memorial was dedicated in 1931 by President Herbert Hoover. Sawyer's practice and leadership within the Harding Memorial Association fell to his son, Dr. Carl Sawyer, who ran both organizations until his death in the late 1960s. In the 1980s, the Harding Memorial and the Harding Home were transferred to the Ohio Historical Society.

At the time of forming it was only a reserve force but soon developed into a regular force responsible for the defence of Ceylon. The CDF was under the command of the General Officer Commanding, Ceylon of the British Army in Ceylon if mobilised. However mobilisation could be carried out only under orders from the Governor. Personal Its commissioned officers received their commission from the Governor, instead of the British Monarch which was the case in the British Army. Since the force was a volunteer force, its personal were made up of exclusively of the upper and middle class of the island who could spare the free time. Much of the officer carder was made up of Europeans, Burghers and a smaller extent from the Sinhalese, Tamils and Moor communities. A few Europeans had served with the British Army, vast majority were planters, landowners and professionals such as lawyers, doctors engineers and civil servants. Oxbridge graduates could easily gain a commission. Officer training was limited with, much of the training and activity were planned on weekends and at the annual training camp and exercise that took place in Diyatalawa. Infantry companies were formed in cities and towns with local volunteers. History The origins of the Ceylon Defence Force can be traced back to the formation of the Ceylon Volunteers in 1881, whereby the Citizens' Rifle Society rifle section was designated the 1st Battalion Ceylon Light Infantry with Lieutenant Colonel John Scott Armtage appointed as the first Commanding Officer. The Ceylon Volunteers subsequently were renamed the Ceylon Volunteer Force and finally was renamed the Ceylon Defence Force in 1910. Units of the Ceylon Volunteer Force in 1910. * Ceylon Artillery Volunteers (CAV) * Ceylon Light Infantry (CLI) * Ceylon Mounted Infantry (CMI) * Ceylon Planters Rifle Corps (CPRC) * Ceylon Volunteer Medical Corps (CVMC) * Ceylon Engineers (CE) * Cadet Battalion Ceylon Light Infantry =Second Boer War= In 1900 Ceylon Mounted Infantry saw action and in 1902 a contingent of Ceylon Planters Rifle Corps, took part in the Second Boer War in South Africa. Their services were recognised by presentation, in 1902, of a colour to the Ceylon Mounted Infantry, and a presentation in 1904, of a Banner to the Ceylon Planters Rifle Corps. Although there were Ceylonese officers much of the officer corps was made up of British officers and the other ranks where mostly Ceylonese with the exception of the Ceylon Planters Rifle Corps which was completely made up of Europeans. =World War I= In 1914 with the out break of World War I the Ceylon Defence Force was mobilised and expanded. Many volunteers from the Defence Force traveled to England and joined the British Army, and many of them were killed in action. One of them mentioned by Arthur Conan Doyle was Private Jacotine of the Ceylon Light Infantry, who was the last man left alive in his unit at the Battle of Lys, and who continued to fight for 20 minutes before he was killed. The CPRC sent a force of 8 officers and 229 other ranks commanded by Major J. Hall Brown to the Great War. The unit sailed for Egypt in October 1914, and was deployed in defence of the Suez Canal. This unit was officially attached to the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) and was in 1915 dispatched to Anzac Cove (‚ÄòZ‚Äô Beach) on the Gallipoli Peninsula. The CPRC performed operational duties as guards to ANZAC headquarter staff, including the General Officer Commanding ANZAC, Lieutenant General William Birdwood, who remarked, ‚ÄúI have an excellent guard of Ceylon Planters who are such a nice lot of fellows.‚Äù According to its onetime Commanding Officer (CO), Colonel T.Y. Wright (1904‚Äì1912), the Ceylon Planters Rifle Corps had sustained overall losses of 80 killed and 99 wounded in the Great War. Soon after the war the 80th Carnatics, who were the last regular military unit stationed in Ceylon on garrison duties, left. This resulted in the Ceylon Defence Force becoming a regular military unit with some units, such as the Mobilized Detachment of Ceylon Light Infantry Volunteers having troops mobilised on a permanent basis. =World War II= In 1939 with the Second World War Ceylon Defence Force was mobilised and expanded to fortify Ceylon to meet a possible threat posed by the Japanese. CDF came direct command of the South East Asia Command (SEAC) and formed part of the British 11th Army Group. It was sometimes referred to as the British Army in Ceylon during this time. South East Asia Command under Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten had its headquarters located at Kandy, Ceylon. Troops from the Ceylon Defence Force, mainly the Ceylon Light Infantry and the Ceylon Garrison Artillery were placed outside Ceylon undertaking garrison duties on the Seychelles and the Cocos Islands. In Cocos Islands Mutiny took place (encouraged by Trotskyist Lanka Sama Samaja Party) by a few members of the Ceylon Garrison Artillery but was immediately put down by the Ceylon Light Infantry. CLI troops in 1941 escorted Italian POWs from the Middle East to Ceylon, and later in 1946 Japanese POWs from Ceylon to India. In 1945 reached its wartime peak at 645 officers and 14,247 other ranks. At the centre of the expansion was the Ceylon Light Infantry which grew by 1946 from one to five battalions. =Post war= In 1947 the CDF was again mobilised in its last major internal security operation to suppress a left wing hartal, or mass stoppage of work. The Ceylon Defence Force was given additional support by an armed detachment of British Royal Marines from HMS Glasgow, who were utilised to deter strikers in Colombo. The Ceylon Defence Force was officially disbanded on 11 April 1949 and reconstituted by Army Act No. 17 of 1949 which revoked the Ceylon Defence Force Ordinance of 1910 as the Ceylon Volunteer Force (CVF), itself becoming the Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force (SLAVF) in 1972. Impact on the Ceylon Army Soldiers who had experience in the CDF were actively recruited into the newly constructed regular force, and reconstituted volunteer force of the new Ceylon Army. In its first few years, and with few exceptions, the only new recruits enlisted were officer cadets and soldiers below the rank of warrant officer. Ceylon Defence Force veterans featured prominently in the post- independence regular Ceylon Army until General D. S. Attygalle (1967‚Äì1977) finished his term as Commander. The last Ceylon Defence Force veteran to leave the Army was Brigadier T. S. B. Sally, who ended his service tenure in 1979.

On or near the banks of the Fal are the castles of Pendennis and St Mawes as well as Trelissick Garden. The River Fal separates the Roseland peninsula from the rest of Cornwall. Like most of its kind on the south coast of Cornwall and Devon, the Fal estuary is a classic ria, or drowned river valley. The Fal estuary from Tregony to the Truro River was originally called Hafaraell (, meaning fallow place). Toponymy The origin and meaning of the name of the river are unknown. The earliest occurrences of the name are in documents from AD 969 and 1049. Falmouth, a town which was named Smithwick until the 17th century, is named after the River Fal.Ekwall, E. (1940) The Concise Dictionary of English Place-names; 2nd ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press; p. 165 The word Fal in Cornish may refer to a prince, or perhaps to a spade or shovel. Robert Williams notes these meanings in his 1865 Cornish dictionary.Robert Williams, ed., Lexicon cornu- britannicum: a dictionary of the ancient Celtic language of Cornwall (London, 1865). However, he notes F√ÇL as the word P√ÇL after undergoing aspirate mutation; and a word FAL meaning prince, but apparently a ghost word. He does not link either of these to the name of the river Fal. History The river mouth and Falmouth harbour served as an anchorage in the immediate years after the Second World War for scores of laid-up Royal Navy vessels (including battleships, carriers, and cruisers) awaiting sale for scrap. Its size and depth of water made it ideal for this use. The River Fal suffered a severe, high-profile pollution accident in February 1992, when a nearby tin mine was flooded. The river turned red and an extensive cleaning-up operation was needed to decontaminate the water. During times of reduced global trade, ships are mothballed in the upper parts of the estuary of the River Fal. The ships, using the Fal estuary due to its depth and protection from the elements, keep a skeleton crew for ship maintenance. A large number of ships were moored in the estuary during the late-2000s financial crisis, as falling global trade meant a smaller demand for trade ships. Falmouth Harbour authority charges companies for usage of the river, until the ships are either reactivated, scrapped or sold. Geography and hydrology The source can be traced to Pentevale, (more correctly Pentivale http://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?x=198965&y;=58825&z;=115&sv;=198965,58825&st;=4&ar;=y&mapp;=map.srf&searchp;=ids.srf&dn;=855&ax;=198965&ay;=58825&lm;=0 ) (, meaning head spring of the Fal). The catchment of the Fal is predominantly Devonian slates, shales and grits, with granite in the upper reaches. Land use is mainly agricultural with some woodland. Tributaries of the River Fal include the Truro River, River Kennal, Penryn River and Carnon River. Several tidal creeks discharge into the River Fal including Mylor Creek, Pill Creek, Penpol Creek, the Percuil River and Restronguet Creek. The Fal/Truro waterway is navigable between Falmouth and Truro. The River Fal is crossed by the King Harry Ferry, a vehicular chain ferry that links the villages of Feock and Philleigh approximately equidistant between Truro and Falmouth. The river flows through the Carrick Roads, a large ria that creates a natural harbour. Wildlife and conservation Five Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) have been designated along the River Fal. The river rises on Goss Moor which is both a National Nature Reserve and part of a SSSI. The wetland habitats and western dry heath communities were formed, since the Bronze Age, by the mining of the alluvial tin deposits. South Terras Mine SSSI is also a Geological Conservation Review (GCR) site of national importance and was once a commercial uranium mine. The Crowhill Valley SSSI between Grampound and St Stephen is an ancient woodland dominated by sessile oak on the slopes, and of willow and alder carr on the floodplain which has a rich ground flora. The species list includes many ancient woodland indicators including lichens such as Parmelia endochlora. The Upper Fal Estuary and Woods SSSI is mostly within the tidal area of the river between Tregony and Turnaware Point and includes mudflats, salt marsh and ancient woodland. The mudflats support nationally important numbers of black-tailed godwit as well as large populations of wintering waders and wildfowl such as curlew and golden plover. A series of transition zones occur from the salt marsh to scrub, where young trees attempt to grow despite the threat of the highest tides, to ancient woodland on the higher slopes. These zones and the estuary itself are important for otter. The lowest part of the Fal along with the Helford River is designated as the Fal and Helford Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive for the shallow bays and inlets, sandbanks and mudflats, and for its salt marshes. Part of the area is also designated as an Important Plant Area and a SSSI (Lower Fal & Helford Intertidal) for the relatively undisturbed transitions from tidal mud through saltmarsh and scrub to woodland. Recreation The River Fal is accessible for kayaking, sailing and other watersports. =Towns and villages on the Fal= * Falmouth * Feock * Flushing * Grampound * Mylor * Old Kea * Penryn * St Clement * St Just in Roseland * Tregony * Truro References Category:Rivers of Cornwall Category:Falmouth, Cornwall Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Cornwall Category:Special Areas of Conservation in Cornwall Category:Nature Conservation Review sites Category:Cornish Killas ","title":"River Fal"},{"id":"924607","text":"Northwest (NW or N.W.) is the northwestern quadrant of Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States, and is located north of the National Mall and west of North Capitol Street.

February 12, 1995) was an American bass guitar player for the rock group Iron Butterfly and associated groups between 1974 and 1980. He later became a computer engineering executive and inventor. He disappeared in February 1995 and was found dead in May 1999. Early life and music career Philip Taylor Kramer was born in 1952 in Youngstown, Ohio. In 1974, he joined Iron Butterfly as its bass player, playing on two of the group's albums, Scorching Beauty and Sun and Steel, both released in 1975.Swanson, David The mysterious death of Iron Butterfly bassist Philip Taylor Kramer. Ultimate Classic Rock, February 12, 2015. Retrieved July 6, 2016. After the breakup of Iron Butterfly, Kramer continued to play with founding member Ron Bushy in the groups Magic and Gold between 1977 and 1980. Engineering career Kramer later obtained a degree in aerospace engineering, he worked on the MX missile guidance system for a contractor of the US Department of Defense and later in the computer industry on fractal compression, facial recognition systems, and advanced communications. Kramer, the son of a professor of electrical engineering, had a lifelong interest in science and mathematical theorems. In 1964, at the age of 12, he won the science fair at Liberty School in Youngstown, Ohio, by building a laser with a beam strong enough to pop a balloon. In 1990, at the age of 38, Kramer co- founded Total Multimedia Inc. with Randy Jackson (brother of Michael Jackson) to develop data compression techniques for CD-ROMs.Leiby, Richard , Washington Post, October 6, 1996; also archived The firm claims it developed the first video compression capable of producing full motion video from a single speed CD-ROM in 1992. In 1994 the company was reorganized under bankruptcy and hired new leadership. Kramer continued working there until his disappearance, though he was profoundly affected by the bankruptcy and reorganization. Kramer co- developed SoftVideo based on fractal compression and he also claimed to work on a transmission project that would result in faster-than-light speed communications. The latter related to his father Ray's long-running family effort to discredit Albert Einstein's theories. Death and investigation On February 12, 1995, Kramer drove to Los Angeles International Airport to pick up a business associate and his wife. The business associate had been a principal investor in Total Multimedia and also a principal instigator of its bankruptcy reorganization. On his way to the airport, Kramer telephoned his wife to advise that plans had changed, and that the business associate and his wife should go directly from the airport to a hotel, where Kramer and his wife would meet them later. Kramer nonetheless appears to have spent forty-five minutes at the airport, for unexplained reasons.Reed, Leonard Missing: Philip (Taylor) Kramer. Los Angeles Times, March 30, 1995. Retrieved July 6, 2016. During his travel to and from the airport, Kramer made a flurry of cell phone calls, including calls to his wife, Ron Bushy and finally to the police. In the latter call, Kramer said, \\"I'm going to kill myself. And I want everyone to know O.J. Simpson is innocent. They did it.\\" This is supposedly in reference to video evidence in which Taylor was hired just before his disappearance to analyze the authenticity of a video tape that the FBI and the DEA had on the O.J. Simpson murder trial. Kramer was never heard from again. His disappearance led to a massive search, many news reports, and talk show segments including an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show, America's Most Wanted, The Unexplained (\\"Strange Disappearances,\\" first aired June 7, 2000) and Unsolved Mysteries Season 8 Episode 3. An article in Skeptic Vol. 4, No. 2, 1996, by Fredric L.

However, his father never believed he killed himself and is quoted as saying \\"Taylor had told me a long time before there were people bothering him.

Designed by George W. Kelham, the building was the first residence hall on campus, dedicated in 1929, and was California's first state-owned residence hall. It was built in 1928 on a $350,000 grant by Mary McNear Bowles in memory of her husband, Cal alumnus and UC Regent Phillip E. Bowles. Mr. Bowles was said to have three loves: horses, horticulture and the University of California. The Hall displays appearance of a medieval castle, with a stone exterior and a wood entryway. Although a University-operated residence hall, its male-only tradition, classic facade, partitioned four-man rooms, and community facilities gave it a social fraternity atmosphere. \\"Bowlesmen\\" have traditionally been a tight-knit group of students who regularly practice various traditions and rituals that are exclusive to the Hall. In the 1980s, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places, an example of 'Collegiate Gothic' architecture. From 2006 to 2014, a group of Hall alumni worked with University officials to create a plan whereby the Hall would be restored and reconstituted as a co-ed Residential College via public-private financing. Following a 14-month restoration project, the Hall reopened in August 2016. The building An etching of the Bowles Hall crest. \\"Ut Tibi Sic Alteri\\" is the motto and it is translated as \\"As to yourself so to another.\\" Designed by George W. Kelham, the building has eight levels comprising two-room suites and a common room (originally designed to house two, but now housing four). The Julien and Helen Hart Memorial Library was added to the building in 1939 through the gift of James D. Hart, their son, and Joseph Bransten, their daughter. Hart was a professor of English and the editor of the Oxford Handbook of American Literature. Bowles Hall also sits on top of the Hayward Fault. In order to avoid having the aging residence hall dismantled in the late 1980s, the Bowlesmen successfully petitioned to have the building added to the National Register of Historic Places (#89000195, 1989). The hall was also designated a City of Berkeley landmark on October 17, 1988. The hall earned LEED Silver certification in August 2017. Recent history ‚Äì restoration The UC administration attempted to dismantle Bowles Hall and build a new residence hall in its place, but this was deterred when Bowles Hall was entered into the National Register of Historic Places. In April 2001, food service in the dining hall was ended and the dining room made into a generic \\"recreation room.\\" The dining hall had previously hosted popular barbecue dinners on Friday evenings. In 2006, the Haas School of Business was planning to turn Bowles into an educational center and conference facility,The Daily Californian but the university backed down from the decision. At about this time, a group of alumni formed the Bowles Hall Alumni Association, and then the Bowles Hall Foundation, with the aim of establishing Bowles Hall as a modern residential college. In 2014, the Regents of the University of California approved a plan that enables the Bowles Hall Foundation, a 501c(3) entity, to renovate and operate Bowles Hall as a residential college under a 45-year lease. The Foundation developed a plan to completely renovate and refurnish Bowles Hall. In June 2015, formal agreements with the Regents of the University of California were executed. The restored Hall reopened in August 2016. It serves 188 undergraduate students, three live-in faculty members, and several graduate residents. It is considered on- campus housing for the purposes of financial aid.  History  In the late 1940s and the 1950s, Rose Gilmore, the widow of a Berkeley professor who was looking for her own calling at Cal, fulfilled the position of Head Resident. Women have only been welcomed as residents since 2016.

Bowles Hall drinking song Traditionally the Cal Band parades from nearby Memorial Stadium through the campus and streets of Berkeley after a home football game. The band will play in front of Bowles Hall during their tour, playing \\"By\\" for the Bowlesmen. The tradition of playing \\"By\\" for Bowles Hall is said to have begun back when the entire football team lived there. The band would play for the players as they walked back to their residence hall after the game. However, when the football team was relocated, the band decided not to play in front of Bowles Hall. Subsequently, some of the men of Bowles lay down in the road, blocking the Cal Band from playing, until the band was forced to oblige them. Thus, the tradition of the Cal Band playing for the men of Bowles after a home football game has persisted to this day. We're the men of Bowles Association, Coming here from over all the nation. Drinking here together one and all, We lift our voices loud for Bowles Hall! (Chorus) Here's to Bowles Association. Drink it down and then, Drink a toast to home sweet home, Of California men. Rah! Rah! Rah! Fill your glasses to the brim, And lift them in the air. And drink a toast to Bowles Association, And the Golden Bear. Men of Bowles are gathered here together, Toasting everything from girls to weather. But the very greatest toast of all, Is the one that we now give to Bowles Hall!

The effort found little support in the market and dissolved due to a lack of sales and infighting within the group. History = Formation = The consortium was announced on the 9th of April 1991 by Compaq, Microsoft, MIPS Computer Systems, Digital Equipment Corporation, and the Santa Cruz Operation. At the time it was widely believed that RISC-based systems would maintain a price/performance advantage over the ad hoc Wintel systems. However, it was also widely believed that Windows NT would quickly displace many other operating systems through the combined effects of a wide selection of software and the ease of building Wintel machines that supported it. ACE was formed to provide an alternative platform to Wintel, providing a viable alternative with the same advantages in terms of software support, and greater advantages in terms of performance. The environment standardized on the MIPS architecture and two operating systems: SCO UNIX with Open Desktop and what would become Windows NT (originally named OS/2 3.0). The Advanced RISC Computing (ARC) document was produced to give hardware and firmware specifications for the platform. Other members of the consortium included Acer, Control Data Corporation, Kubota, NEC Corporation, NKK, Olivetti, Prime Computer, Pyramid Technology, Siemens, Silicon Graphics, Sony, Sumitomo, Tandem Computers, Wang Laboratories, and Zenith Data Systems. Besides these large companies, several start-up companies built ACE-compliant systems as well. Each of the companies involved had their own reasons for joining the ACE effort. The initiative was used by microprocessor companies as an attempt to take market share away from Intel. System companies used the initiative as an attempt to take market share away from the workstation leader, Sun Microsystems. =The \\"Apache Group\\"= Soon after the initiative was announced, a dissenting faction of seven ACE members declared that the decision to support only little-endian architectures was short-sighted. This subgroup, known as the Apache Group, promoted a big-endian alternative. The group, whose name was conceived as a pun on \\"Big Indian\\", was unrelated to the later Apache Software Foundation. It later adopted the name MIPS/Open. A rift within the ACE consortium was averted when it was decided to add support for big-endian SVR4. =Dissolution= Even so, the ACE initiative (and consortium) began to fall apart little more than a year after it started, as it became apparent that there was not a mass market for an alternative to the Wintel computing platform. The upstart platforms did not offer enough performance improvement from the incumbent PC and there were major cost disadvantages of such systems due to the low volume production. When the initiative started, RISC based systems (running at 100-200 MHz at the time) had substantial performance advantage over Intel 80486 and original Pentium chips (running at approximately 60 MHz at the time). Intel quickly migrated the Pentium design to newer semiconductor process generations and that performance (and operating frequency) advantage slipped away. Compaq was the first company to leave the consortium, stating that with the departure of CEO Rod Canion, one of the primary backers behind the formation of ACE, they were shifting priorities away from higher-end systems. This was followed in short order by SCO announcing that they were suspending all work on moving their version of Unix to the MIPS platform. There were other potential conflicts: earlier that year, MIPS had been purchased by SGI, which may have also contributed to concerns about the neutrality of the target platform. DEC had released their Alpha processor and were less interested in promoting a competing architecture. And finally, the significant improvements in Intel x86 performance made abandoning it less attractive, and although ACE supported x86 for a time, Intel was never a member. ARC The main product of the ACE group is the Advanced RISC Computing specification, or ARC. It was initially based on MIPS-based computer hardware and firmware environment. Although ACE went defunct, and no computer was ever manufactured which fully complied with the ARC standard, the ARC system still exerts a widespread legacy in that all Microsoft Windows NT-based operating systems (such as Windows XP) used ARC conventions for naming boot devices before Windows Vista. Further, SGI used a modified version of the ARC firmware (which it called ARCS) in its systems. All SGI computers which run IRIX 6.1 or later (such as the Indy, Octane, etc.) boot from an ARCS console (which uses the same drive naming conventions as Windows, accordingly). In addition, most of the various RISC-based computers designed to run Windows NT used versions of the ARC boot console to boot NT. Among these computers were: * MIPS R4000-based systems such as the MIPS Magnum workstation * all Alpha-based machines with a PCI bus designed prior to the end of support for Windows NT Alpha in September 1999 (the Alpha ARC firmware was also known as AlphaBIOS) * most Windows NT-capable PowerPC computers (such as the IBM RS/6000 40P). It was also predicted that Intel IA-32-based computers would adopt the ARC console, although only SGI ever marketed such IA-32-based machines with ARC firmware (namely, the SGI Visual Workstation series, which went on sale in 1999). Systems Products complying (to some degree) with the ARC standard include: *Alpha **DEC Multia and AlphaStation/AlphaServer **DeskStation Raptor *i386 **SGI Visual Workstation *MIPS **Acer PICA **Carrera Computers, Inc Cobra R4000 and VIPER **Digital DECstation 5000 **DeskStation Tyne **Microsoft Jazz **MIPS Magnum **Olivetti M700 **NEC RISCstation **NeTpower Fastseries MP **SGI Indigo¬≤, Indy, Challenge, Onyx, Origin etc. Big-Endian ARCS **Siemens-Nixdorf RM200, RM300, RM400 *PowerPC **IBM Personal Computer Power Series 850/830 PReP **IBM RS/6000 40P, 43P, E20, F30 ** Motorola PowerStack ** Tangent MediaStar See also * The AIM alliance‚Äîa competing initiative based on the PowerPC, led by Apple Computer, IBM and Motorola References External links *NetBSD project description of ACE (contains following links) *ARC specification pdf file at www.netbsd.org * * Linux-MIPS (ARC) article Category:Advanced RISC Computing Category:Computer hardware standards Category:MIPS architecture Category:Unix history ","title":"Advanced Computing Environment"},{"id":"924636","text":"The Nestorian Schism (431), in church history, involved a split between the Christian churches of Sassanid Persia, which affiliated with Nestorius, and churches that rejected him. The schism rose out of a Christological dispute, notably involving Cyril (Patriarch of Alexandria) and Nestorius (Patriarch of Constantinople). The First Council of Ephesus in 431 and the Council of Chalcedon in 451 condemned Nestorius and his doctrine, which emphasized the radical distinctness between Christ's human and divine natures. That forced a breach between the churches that defended Nestorius and the state church of the Roman Empire, which caused the Church of the East, the Christian church of Sassanid Persia, to become known as the Nestorian Church, as it took the side of Nestorius. History The doctrine of Nestorianism is associated with Nestorius, the Patriarch of Constantinople from 428 to 431. Prior to becoming Patriarch, Nestorius had been a student of Theodore of Mopsuestia at the School of Antioch. Nestorius argued that Christ's human and divine natures were distinct and so he was against using the title Theotokos (Greek: \\"God bearer\\") for the Virgin Mary. He preferred to call her Christotokos (\\"Christ bearer\\"). Cyril of Alexandria considered the doctrine contrary to Orthodox teaching and encouraged measures against it. Finally, Nestorius and his doctrine were condemned at the First Council of Ephesus in 431, which was reiterated at the Council of Chalcedon in 451. Afterward, churches aligned with Nestorius were centred on the School of Edessa and were separated from the rest of the Christian Church. Anathemised in the Roman Empire, they relocated to the Sassanid Empire, where they were welcomed by Persian Christians, who had already declared independence of Constantinople in an attempt to cast off accusations of foreign allegiance. The School of Edessa relocated to the Mesopotamian city of Nisibis. The School of Nisibis thereafter became a centre of Nestorianism. In 484, the Sassanids executed the pro-Byzantine Catholicos Babowai and enabled the Nestorian bishop of Nisibis, Barsauma, to increase his influence over the bishops of the region. That effectively ended links between Persian Christianity and the Roman Empire. Thereafter, Nestorianism spread widely through Asia, gaining a presence in India, Central Asia, the Mongol territories, and China. The medieval Nestorian movement survives in the Assyrian Church of the East, most widely in Iraq, Syria and Iran.

After an initial November 1992 preview issue, Animerica's first regular issue was released in February of 1993 with a March 1993 cover date. In 1998, Animerica Extra was launched as a separate manga anthology magazine which eventually focused specifically on sh≈çjo titles. It was canceled in 2004. Viz changed the magazine's format in April 2005, with the new magazine being three different free publications of the same name. One is advertising-oriented and created specially for distribution at anime and manga conventions while the other is more general in scope and with a version each for distribution through Waldenbooks and Borders stores. A similar version was later added for Best Buy stores. All three versions have fewer and briefer articles and a lower page count. Animerica was one of the first top professional anime and manga magazines released in the United States, and one of the most popular in the 1990s. In 2004, it had a circulation of 45,000 readers, but low sales and high competition from Newtype USA resulted in the essential cancellation of the original magazine and its reformatting as a free digest. 100 copies of the first issue of the free digest were sent to 1,000 Waldenbooks and Border stores. History Animerica was introduced in 1992 with the release of a very low print issue 0, a preview issue, in November 1992, with the first official issue following in March 1993. With Viz's connections to Shogakukan, the magazine was one of the first professional-quality anime and manga oriented magazine to be released in the United States. At the magazine's launch, it was co-edited by Seiji Horibuchi, Satoru Fujii, and Trish Ledoux. In 1998, Viz introduced a related magazine, Animerica Extra, which was its first monthly manga anthology. This secondary magazine was canceled in 2004. To celebrate the magazine's ninth anniversary, Viz launched a redesign of the magazine starting with the November 2001 issue that included a new cover design, a new logo, and an increased focus on news, reviews, and Japanese trends. Fold-out posters were also added to every issue. During 2002 the magazine was published in a square bound, full colour format without a manga serial that had previously been included. By 2003, the magazine had also doubled its initial page count. When Viz began publication of Animerica, it registered the name as a trademark. In 1997, a Japanese company named Redsun began using the domain name \\"animerica.com\\" to host an adult oriented and hentai distribution website. Viz attempted to purchase the domain name from the company, but Redsun refused. Viz filed a lawsuit claiming the website infringed on its trademark. The court agreed that the website was causing confusion with Viz's publication, but that the confusion was primarily limited to American audiences. The court refused Viz's request that the site be shut down and its assets frozen. It did, however, require that Redsun put a disclaimer on its website and all advertising noting that it was not affiliated with the Animerica magazine nor with Viz Media and that it provide a link to Viz's existing official website for the magazine at \\"www.animerica- mag.com.\\"Viz Communications, Inc. v. Redsun , No. C-01-04235 JF, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24481 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 8, 2004) In November 2004, Redsun's adult website closed. Viz claimed the name in 2005, and by October the site had been relaunched as the official website of the new Animerica magazine. =Reformatted= In April 2005, Viz announced that the magazine would be reformatted into two different free versions, and the monthly subscription version would be discontinued. The first version, similar to the original but with a lower page count, is advertising-sponsored and produced exclusively for specific anime and manga conventions and made available at those conventions for free. The second version is a quarterly digest-sized magazine that focuses more on content and has a wider range of content versus the convention version. Termed \\"magalogs\\" by Viz, these digest versions are distributed freely at Borders and Waldenbooks. A third variety, specifically for Best Buy stores was later added to the line up. The last monthly issue of the original Animerica was released with a cover date of June 2005 (Volume 13, No. 6). Subscriptions to the original magazine were replaced with subscriptions to Viz's Shojo Beat manga anthology which was launched in July 2005. Features Each issue of the original Animerica included articles covering anime and manga releases in both the United States and Japan, interviews with industry professionals such as voice actors and directors, reviews of anime and manga series, and articles and reviews on related areas such as games, model kits, and music releases. They would also include a single chapter from a current Viz manga series. Over the course of the magazine's history, chapters from Area 88, Galaxy Express 999, One-Pound Gospel, and Urusei Yatsura appeared in it. Final issues of the magazine still included articles on anime and manga releases, reviews of titles, and manga previews, but they were all shorter and more concise than the original. The new version had a much lower page count, leaving fewer articles in each issue. Circulation and reception Animerica was one of the most popular anime and manga magazines in North America for nearly a decade. In July 2000, Animerica was named the Best English-language publication at the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation awards at Anime Expo. In 2004, the magazine had a circulation of 45,000, with 80% of its issues bought via newsstands rather than by subscription. This number was a drop from previous years, due to greater competition from other magazines, resulting in Viz's changing its format. Approximately 100 copies of the first issue of the free version of Animerica were sent to 1,000 Borders and Waldenbooks stores around the United States.

She has won several awards for her works. Career Hodgell holds a master's in English literature and a doctorate in 19th-century English literature, both earned at the University of Minnesota. She completed her Ph.D. and subsequent dissertation on Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe between the publication of her first two fantasy novels, God Stalk and Dark of the Moon. She is a graduate of the Clarion and the Milford Writer's Workshops. In academia, Hodgell produced an audio-cassette-based course on science fiction and fantasy for the University of Minnesota. She taught for many years in the English Department at University of Wisconsin‚ÄìOshkosh, but retired in 2006 to pursue a full-time writing career. While at the University of Wisconsin, P. C. Hodgell divided her time between teaching and writing, with a strong emphasis on \\"anything that stirs the imagination\\". This included attending science fiction conventions, and hobbies such as collecting yarn, knitting, embroidering, and raising cats. Over the years, P. C. Hodgell was published by several publishing houses. Two of her more recent publishers, Hypatia Press and Meisha Merlin went out of business, the latter in 2007, respectively, temporarily leaving her without a venue for future works. Her work was picked up by Baen in or shortly before 2010, who published the fifth \\"Jame\\" novel, Bound in Blood, and reissued the previous four books as a pair of omnibus editions, The God Stalker Chronicles and Seeker's Bane.Steve Clark's Kencyr Page Baen also released the novels as e-books. P. C. Hodgell resides in a nineteenth-century wood-framed house which has been in her family for generations. Both her parents were professional artists. Series synopsis The Kencyr books, beginning with God Stalk, focus on the three peoples of the Kencyrath, Highborn (leaders), Kendar (artisans and soldiers) and Arrin-Ken (cat-like judges). They were brought together by the Three-Faced God to oppose the threat of chaos called Perimal Darkling 30,000 years before the events of the books. For eons the Kencyrath have waged a long retreat, seemingly abandoned by their god, awaiting the birth of the promised Tyr- Ridan, the three who would lead the final battle against Perimal Darkling. Three thousand years have passed since the Kencyrath retreated to Rathillien after a devastating betrayal. Much diminished, they remain outsiders to the native powers of Rathillien. Jame (Jamethiel), a Highborn woman, flees into Rathillien after years in the Shadows of the last world to fall, her memories incomplete. Gradually discovers that her twin brother Tori, now known as Torisen Black Lord, has regained their father's place as Highlord of the Kencyrath. She also suspects, from her connection to the destructive side of the Kencyr deity, that she may be one of the Tyr-Ridan. Her brother and her cousin Kindrie, a healer, seem likely to be the other two, representing Creation and Preservation, respectively. The Kencyrath are by no means at peace, beset by the peoples and powers of Rathillien, riven by divisions between the three people and by the political discord between the nine major Houses of the Highborn. Behind this story is another one, the betrayal of the Kencyrath by Gerridon Highlord three thousand years earlier on another world. He and his sister, Jamethiel Dream Weaver, almost destroyed the entire Kencyr host. From his house in the Shadows of the fallen world, Gerridon and his remaining adherents scheme to maintain their immortality, having played no small role in the decline of House Knorth, of which Jame, Tori and Kindrie are the last survivors. As Tori struggles to find his place as leader of their people, Jame struggles to find a place amongst them and unravels the dark secrets of their heritage she learns Gerridon has plans for her other than as one of the Tyr-Ridan. The three young Knorths are products of Gerridon's dealings to create a replacement for his fading sister, a new Dream Weaver to harvest more Kencyr souls to sustain him, for the Dream Weaver was Tori and Jame's mother, while Gerridon himself sired Kindrie.

It has since become a catchphrase and punchline. Origin The phrase was first used by promoter Horace Logan at the Shreveport Municipal Memorial Auditorium in Shreveport, Louisiana, on December 15, 1956.Logan, Horace, and Bill Sloan. 1998. Elvis, Hank, and me: making musical history on the Louisiana hayride, p. 181-183. New York: St. Martin's Press. Elvis had appeared in the middle of the night's lineup, and Logan needed to quiet the audience so that the remaining performers could play. The full quotation was: \\"Elvis has left the building\\" is also heard at the end of Elvis' March 1961 Pearl Harbor Memorial benefit concert, after Elvis exits at the end of \\"Hound Dog\\" and a short coda from the band. Throughout the 1970s, the phrase was captured on record several times, spoken by Al Dvorin. In later years the phrase would be spoken by some of Presley's backup singers to calm down the audience after concerts. In popular culture The phrase has since become a catchphrase and punchline, used to refer to anyone who has exited in some sense (even death). For instance, it might be used when someone makes a dramatic exit from an argument, to relieve tension among those who remain. Baseball broadcasters on radio or television sometimes use the phrase as a humorous way to describe a home run, which is typically hit over the outfield fence, leaving the field of play. Other examples or variants include: *Pittsburgh Penguins hockey hall of fame broadcaster Mike Lange uses the phrase after Penguins home game wins.NYTimes blog mentions Mike Lange *In the early part of his original heel run, WWE wrestler Shawn Michaels's departure from the arena during live events would be announced by the announcers as \\"The Heartbreak Kid Shawn Michaels has left the building.\\" *When singing \\"Tossed Salads And Scrambled Eggs,\\" the closing theme to the television series Frasier, Kelsey Grammer sometimes followed the last line with the statement, \\"Frasier has left the building!\\" It was mostly used by Elvis himself in famous songs.

It is the ancestral home of the Sidney family, and was the birthplace of the great Elizabethan poet, courtier and soldier, Sir Philip Sidney. The original medieval house is one of the most complete surviving examples of 14th-century domestic architecture in England. Part of the house and its gardens are open for public viewing. Many TV shows and movies have been filmed at Penshurst. History Private entrance to Penshurst Place, Penshurst, Kent. The ancient village of Penshurst was situated within the manor of that name: the manor appears as Penecestre or Penchester, a name adopted by Stephen de Penecestre, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, who possessed the manor towards the end of the 13th century. The present manor house was built in 1341 for Sir John de Pulteney, a London merchant and four times Lord Mayor of London who wanted a country residence within easy distance of London. This was at the time when such properties ceased to be castles: they were more dwellings that could be defended in an emergency. When Henry IV's third son, John, Duke of Bedford, occupied Penshurst, the second hall, known as the Buckingham Building, was built: so called after the subsequent owners, the Dukes of Buckingham. Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham was executed in 1521 by King Henry VIII following a lavish feast held at Penshurst Place hosted by the Duke in honour of Henry; it then stayed in the crown estate for the rest of Henry's reign, with documented evidence Henry used Penshurst Place as a hunting lodge and visiting with his courtier Brandon, the property being only a few miles from Hever Castle, childhood home of Henry's second wife Anne Boleyn. See Michael Brennan's books for further details. In 1550, Henry VIII's son, King Edward VI, granted the house and estate to Sir Ralph Fane, a supporter of Protector Somerset, but it was forfeited two years later after Sir Ralph was executed for treason. =Sidney family= Penshurst Place was enlarged after 1552 when King Edward VI granted the house to Sir William Sidney (1482-1554), who had been a courtier to the King's father, Henry VIII. Sir William's son Henry (1529-1586) married Lady Mary Dudley, whose family became implicated in the Lady Jane Grey affair, although Henry himself escaped any such implications. During his lifetime he added apartments and the \\"King's Tower\\" to Penshurst. He employed a joiner Evan Lucas to supply panelling and carve ornaments including leopard's heads for the hall and gallery.HMC Report on the Manuscripts of Lord De L'Isle & Dudley at Penshurst Place, vol. 1 (London, 1925), pp. 260-1. Henry Sidney also created what is now one of England's oldest private gardens, with records going back to 1346. Philip Sidney (1554-1586), Henry's son, was born at Penshurst Place in 1554. Poet and courtier, he was buried in old St Paul's, in London, having died 25 days after a fatal wounding from a bullet in the thigh at the battle of Zutphen, but his tomb was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. Philip's brother, Robert Sidney, inherited Penshurst. His time there resulted in more additions to the state rooms, including an impressive \\"Long Gallery\\". He had also inherited the Earldom of Leicester, and his descendants for the next seven generations continued to live at the mansion. By the 19th century, the building was falling into disrepair, but a new occupant in 1818, Sir John Shelley-Sidney, and his son Philip began to restore it. The latter was created 1st Baron De L'Isle and Dudley in 1835. The 6th Baron, William Sidney (1909‚Äì1991), was one of only two men who held both the Victoria Cross and membership of the Order of the Garter; he was created 1st Viscount De L'Isle in 1956. To him and to his son, the 2nd Viscount, much of the modern restoration of Penshurst is due, in spite of the house having suffered neglect during World War I. Today, the house and gardens are open to the public. Many members of the family are buried or commemorated in the Sidney Chapel at St John the Baptist, Penshurst.

While there are no internationally agreed legal definitions for predatory lending, a 2006 audit report from the office of inspector general of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) broadly defines predatory lending as \\"imposing unfair and abusive loan terms on borrowers\\", though \\"unfair\\" and \\"abusive\\" were not specifically defined. Challenges and FDIC Efforts Related to Predatory Lending June 2006 Report No. 06-011 Though there are laws against some of the specific practices commonly identified as predatory, various federal agencies use the phrase as a catch-all term for many specific illegal activities in the loan industry. Predatory lending should not be confused with predatory mortgage servicing which is mortgage practices described by critics as unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent practices during the loan or mortgage servicing process, post loan origination. One less contentious definition of the term is proposed by an investing website as \\"the practice of a lender deceptively convincing borrowers to agree to unfair and abusive loan terms, or systematically violating those terms in ways that make it difficult for the borrower to defend against\\".Investor DictionaryCached copy of the Investor Dictionary definition before it was updated Other types of lending sometimes also referred to as predatory include payday loans, certain types of credit cards, mainly subprime,Note that the FDIC does not offer a specific definition of \\"subprime\\" or other forms of (again, often subprime) consumer debt, and overdraft loans, when the interest rates are considered unreasonably high.\\"Loans to avoid at all costs\\". CBS Early Show. March 6, 2007 Although predatory lenders are most likely to target the less educated, the poor, racial minorities, and the elderly, victims of predatory lending are represented across all demographicsFannie Mae Overview of Predatory Lending Federal Trade Commission. The continued occurrence of predatory lending can be viewed as a litmus test for the effectiveness of philanthropic lending that aims to foster entrepreneurship. Where such philanthropic lending initiatives (microfinance) are widely available, loan sharks and other predatory lenders should not continue to thrive. Predatory lending typically occurs on loans backed by some kind of collateral, such as a car or house, so that if the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender can repossess or foreclose and profit by selling the repossessed or foreclosed property. Lenders may be accused of tricking a borrower into believing that an interest rate is lower than it actually is, or that the borrower's ability to pay is greater than it actually is. The lender, or others as agents of the lender, may well profit from repossession or foreclosure upon the collateral. Abusive or unfair lending practices There are many lending practices which have been called abusive and labeled with the term \\"predatory lending\\". There is a great deal of dispute between lenders and consumer groups as to what exactly constitutes \\"unfair\\" or \\"predatory\\" practices, but the following are sometimes cited: * Unjustified risk-based pricing. This is the practice of charging more (in the form of higher interest rates and fees) for extending credit to borrowers identified by the lender as posing a greater credit risk. The lending industry argues that risk-based pricing is a legitimate practice; since a greater percentage of loans made to less creditworthy borrowers can be expected to go into default, higher prices are necessary to obtain the same yield on the portfolio as a whole. Some consumer groups argue that higher prices paid by more vulnerable consumers cannot always be justified by increased credit risk.ACORN Reports * Single-premium credit insurance. This is the purchase of insurance which will pay off the loan in case the homebuyer dies. It is more expensive than other forms of insurance because it does not involve any medical checkups, but customers almost always are not shown their choices, because usually the lender is not licensed to sell other forms of insurance. In addition, this insurance is usually financed into the loan which causes the loan to be more expensive, but at the same time encourages people to buy the insurance because they do not have to pay up front. * Failure to present the loan price as negotiable. Many lenders will negotiate the price structure of the loan with borrowers. In some situations, borrowers can even negotiate an outright reduction in the interest rate or other charges on the loan. Consumer advocates argue that borrowers, especially unsophisticated borrowers, are not aware of their ability to negotiate and might even be under the mistaken impression that the lender is placing the borrower's interests above its own. Thus, many borrowers do not take advantage of their ability to negotiate. * Failure to clearly and accurately disclose terms and conditions, particularly in cases where an unsophisticated borrower is involved. Mortgage loans are complex transactions involving multiple parties and dozens of pages of legal documents. In the most egregious of predatory cases, lenders or brokers have not only misled borrowers but have also altered documents after they have been signed. * Short-term loans with disproportionally high fees, such as payday loans, credit card late fees, checking account overdraft fees, and Tax Refund Anticipation Loans, where the fee paid for advancing the money for a short period of time works out to an annual interest rate significantly in excess of the market rate for high-risk loans. The originators of such loans dispute that the fees are interest. * Servicing agent and securitization abuses. The mortgage servicing agent is the entity that receives the mortgage payment, maintains the payment records, provides borrowers with account statements, imposes late charges when the payment is late, and pursues delinquent borrowers. A securitization is a financial transaction in which assets, especially debt instruments, are pooled and securities representing interests in the pool are issued. Most loans are subject to being bundled and sold, and the rights to act as servicing agent sold, without the consent of the borrower. A federal statute requires notice to the borrower of a change in servicing agent, but does not protect the borrower from being held delinquent on the note for payments made to the servicing agent who fails to forward the payments to the owner of the note, especially if that servicing agent goes bankrupt, and borrowers who have made all payments on time can find themselves being foreclosed on and becoming unsecured creditors of the servicing agent.Will My Mortgage Loan Be Sold? Foreclosures can sometimes be conducted without proper notice to the borrower. In some states (see Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 746), there is no defense against eviction, forcing the borrower to move and incur the expense of hiring a lawyer and finding another place to live while litigating the claim of the \\"new owner\\" to own the house, especially after it is resold one or more times. When the debtor demands, under the best evidence rule, that the current claimed note owner produce the original note with the debtor's signature on it, the note owner typically is unable or unwilling to do so, and tries to establish his claim with an affidavit that it is the owner, without proving it is the \\"holder in due course\\", the traditional standard for a debt claim, and the courts often allow them to do that. In the meantime, the note continues to be traded, its physical whereabouts difficult to discover. OCC Advisory Letter AL 2003-2 describes predatory lending as including the following: * Loan \\"flipping\\" ‚Äì frequent refinancings that result in little or no economic benefit to the borrower and are undertaken with the primary or sole objective of generating additional loan fees, prepayment penalties, and fees from the financing of credit-related products; * Refinancings of special subsidized mortgages that result in the loss of beneficial loan terms; * \\"Packing\\" of excessive and sometimes \\"hidden\\" fees in the amount financed; * Using loan terms or structures ‚Äì such as negative amortization ‚Äì to make it more difficult or impossible for borrowers to reduce or repay their indebtedness; * Using balloon payments to conceal the true burden of the financing and to force borrowers into costly refinancing transactions or foreclosures; * Targeting inappropriate or excessively expensive credit products to older borrowers, to persons who are not financially sophisticated or who may be otherwise vulnerable to abusive practices, and to persons who could qualify for mainstream credit products and terms; * Inadequate disclosure of the true costs, risks and, where necessary, appropriateness to the borrower of loan transactions; * The offering of single premium credit life insurance; and * The use of mandatory arbitration clauses.  Predatory lending towards minority groups  Because many minority communities have been excluded from loans in the past, they are and have been more vulnerable to deception. Oftentimes, they are targeted because of these vulnerabilities. Organizations and agencies including ACORN, HUD, the American Civil Liberties Union, United for a Fair Economy and more prove that predatory loans are disproportionately made in poor and minority neighborhoods. Brokers and lenders preyed on these neighborhoods with the knowledge that these people were often denied for loans and the demand for loans were high. Lenders called these neighborhoods never- never land. This created the subprime predatory lending world. Subprime lenders specialize in B, C, and D paper. Predatory lending is the practice of overcharging a borrower for rates and fees, average fee should be 1%, these lenders were charging borrowers over 5%. Consumers without challenged credit loans should be underwritten with prime lenders. In 2004 69% of borrowers were from subprime lending. The 2007 mortgage drop and economy fail were from over lending. Organizations such as AARP, Inner City Press, and ACORN have worked to stop what they describe as predatory lending. ACORN has targeted specific companies such as HSBC Finance, successfully forcing them to change their practices.The Nation: Tax Refund Scheme Targets the Working Poor Some subprime lending practices have raised concerns about mortgage discrimination on the basis of race.Study Finds Disparities in Mortgages by Race The New York Times By Manny Fernandez Published: October 15, 2007 African Americans and other minorities are being disproportionately led to sub-prime mortgages with higher interest rates than their white counterparts.NAACP Fights Loan Discrimination Even when median income levels were comparable, home buyers in minority neighborhoods were more likely to get a loan from a subprime lender, though not necessarily a sub-prime loan.  Other targeted groups  In addition, studies by leading consumer groups have concluded that women have become a key component to the subprime mortgage crunch. Professor Anita F. Hill wrote that a large percentage of first-time home buyers were women, and that loan officers took advantage of the lack of financial knowledge of many female loan applicants.Women and the Subprime Crunch . Economica. Consumers believe that they are protected by consumer protection laws, when their lender is really operating wholly outside the laws. Refer to 15 U.S.C. 1601 and 12 C.F.R. 226. Media investigations have disclosed that mortgage lenders used bait-and-switch salesmanship and fraud to take advantage of borrowers during the home-loan boom. In February 2005, for example, reporters Michael Hudson and Scott Reckard broke a story in the Los Angeles Times about \\"boiler room\\" sales tactics at Ameriquest Mortgage, the nation‚Äôs largest subprime lender. Hudson and Reckard cited interviews and court statements by 32 former Ameriquest employees who said the company had abused its customers and broken the law, \\"deceiving borrowers about the terms of their loans, forging documents, falsifying appraisals and fabricating borrowers' income to qualify them for loans they couldn't afford\\".Mike Hudson and E. Scott Reckard, \\"Workers Say Lender Ran 'Boiler Rooms',\\" Los Angeles Times, Feb. 4, 2005. http://www.latimes.com/ameriquest Ameriquest later agreed to pay a $325 million predatory lending settlement with state authorities across the nation. Disputes over predatory lending Some subprime lending advocates, such as the National Home Equity Mortgage Association (NHEMA), say many practices commonly called \\"predatory,\\" particularly the practice of risk-based pricing, are not actually predatory, and that many laws aimed at reducing \\"predatory lending\\" significantly restrict the availability of mortgage finance to lower- income borrowers.National Home Equity Mortgage Association Report Such parties consider predatory lending a pejorative term. Underlying issues There are many underlying issues in the predatory lending debate: * Judicial practices: Some argue that much of the problem arises from a tendency of the courts to favor lenders, and to shift the burden of proof of compliance with the terms of the debt instrument to the debtor. According to this argument, it should not be the duty of the borrower to make sure his payments are getting to the current note-owner, but to make evidence that all payments were made to the last known agent for collection sufficient to block or reverse repossession or foreclosure, and eviction, and to cancel the debt if the current note owner cannot prove he is the \\"holder in due course\\" by producing the actual original debt instrument in court. * Risk-based pricing: The basic idea is that borrowers who are thought of as more likely to default on their loans should pay higher interest rates and finance charges to compensate lenders for the increased risk. In essence, high returns motivate lenders to lend to a group they might not otherwise lend to ‚Äì \\"subprime\\" or risky borrowers. Advocates of this system believe that it would be unfair ‚Äì or a poor business strategy ‚Äì to raise interest rates globally to accommodate risky borrowers, thus penalizing low-risk borrowers who are unlikely to default. Opponents argue that the practice tends to disproportionately create capital gains for the affluent while oppressing working-class borrowers with modest financial resources.In Defense of Payday Lending Some people consider risk-based pricing to be unfair in principle. Lenders contend that interest rates are generally set fairly considering the risk that the lender assumes, and that competition between lenders will ensure availability of appropriately-priced loans to high-risk customers. Still others feel that while the rates themselves may be justifiable with respect to the risks, it is irresponsible for lenders to encourage or allow borrowers with credit problems to take out high-priced loans. For all of its pros and cons, risk-based pricing remains a universal practice in bond markets and the insurance industry, and it is implied in the stock market and in many other open-market venues; it is only controversial in the case of consumer loans. * Competition: Some believe that risk-based pricing is fair but feel that many loans charge prices far above the risk, using the risk as an excuse to overcharge. These criticisms are not levied on all products, but only on those specifically deemed predatory. Proponents counter that competition among lenders should prevent or reduce overcharging. * Financial education: Many observers feel that competition in the markets served by what critics describe as \\"predatory lenders\\" is not affected by price because the targeted consumers are completely uneducated about the time value of money and the concept of Annual percentage rate, a different measure of price than what many are used to. Recent research looked at a legislative experiment in which the State of Illinois, which required ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù mortgage applicants acquiring or refinancing properties in 10 specific zip codes to submit loan offers from state-licensed lenders to review by HUD-certified financial counselors. The experiment found that the legislation pushed some borrowers to choose less risky loan products in order to avoid counseling.Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Do Financial Counseling Mandates Improve Mortgage Choice and Performance? Evidence from a Legislative Experiment, October 2009 * Caveat emptor: There is an underlying debate about whether a lender should be allowed to charge whatever it wants for a service, even if there is no evidence that it attempted to deceive the consumer about the price. At issue here is the belief that lending is a commodity and that the lending community has an almost fiduciary duty to advise the borrower that funds can be obtained more cheaply. Also at issue are certain financial products which appear to be profitable only due to adverse selection or a lack of knowledge on the part of the customers relative to the lenders. For example, some people allege that credit insurance would not be profitable to lending companies if only those customers who had the right \\"fit\\" for the product actually bought it (i.e., only those customers who were not able to get the generally cheaper term life insurance). Regardless, the majority of U.S. courts have refused to treat the lender-borrower relationship as a fiduciary one and declined to impose a duty of care upon lenders in the making of loans.River Glen Assoc., Ltd. v. Merrill Lynch Credit Corp., 295 A.D.2d 274, 275, 743 N.Y.S.2d 870, 871 (1st Dep‚Äôt 2002) (\\"[T]his Court has repeatedly held [that] an arm‚Äôs length borrower-lender relationship is not of a confidential or fiduciary nature and therefore does not support a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation\\").Nymark v. Heart Fed. Savings & Loan Ass'n, 231 Cal. App. 3d 1089, 283 Cal. Rptr. 53 (1991) (\\"The relationship between a lending institution and its borrower-client is not fiduciary in nature\\"). Thus, once the lender has complied with all relevant statutory disclosure obligations, it remains solely the borrower's problem to ascertain whether the loan they are getting is the right fit for them. Predatory borrowing In an article in the January 17, 2008 New York Times, George Mason University economics professor Tyler Cowen described \\"predatory borrowing\\" as potentially a larger problem than predatory lending: :\\"As much as 70 percent of recent early payment defaults had fraudulent misrepresentations on their original loan applications, according to one recent study. The research was done by BasePoint Analytics, which helps banks and lenders identify fraudulent transactions; the study looked at more than three million loans from 1997 to 2006, with a majority from 2005 to 2006. Applications with misrepresentations were also five times as likely to go into default. Many of the frauds were simple rather than ingenious. In some cases, borrowers who were asked to state their incomes just lied, sometimes reporting five times actual income; other borrowers falsified income documents by using computers.\\" Mortgage applications are usually completed by mortgage brokers or lenders' in-house loan officers, rather than by borrowers themselves, making it difficult for borrowers to control the information that was submitted with their applications. A stated income loan application is done by the borrower, and no proof of income is needed. When the broker files the loan, they have to go by whatever income is stated. This opened the doors for borrowers to be approved for loans that they otherwise would not qualify for, or afford. However, lawsuits and testimony from former industry insiders indicated that mortgage company employees frequently were behind overstatements of borrower income on mortgage applications. Borrowers had little or no ability to manipulate other key data points that were frequently falsified during the mortgage process. These included credit scores, home appraisals and loan-to-value ratios. These were all factors that were under the control of mortgage professionals. In 2012, for example, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman reached a $7.8 million settlement of allegations that a leading appraisal management firm had helped inflate real estate appraisals on a wide scale basis in order to help a major lender push through more loan deals. The attorney general office's lawsuit alleged that eAppraiseIT, which did more than 260,000 appraisals nationally for Washington Mutual, caved to pressure from WaMu loan officers to select pliable appraisers who were willing to submit inflated property valuations. Several commentators have dismissed the notion of \\"predatory borrowing\\", accusing those making this argument as being apologists for the lack of lending standards and other excesses during the credit bubble.Tyler Cowen, Apologist for Fraud? Predatory servicing is also a component of predatory lending, characterized by unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent practices by a lender or another company that services a loan on behalf of the lender, after the loan is granted. Those practices include also charging excessive and unsubstantiated fees and expenses for servicing the loan, wrongfully disclosing credit defaults by a borrower, harassing a borrower for repayment and refusing to act in good faith in working with a borrower to effectuate a mortgage modification as required by federal law.Predatory Servicing v. Predatory Lending by Peter Moulinos, Esq. Legislation In many countries, legislation aims to control this, but research has found ambiguous results, including finding that high-cost mortgage applications can possibly rise after adoption of laws against predatory lending.St. Louis Federal Reserve Review, The Varying Effects of Predatory Mortgage Lending Laws on High-Cost Mortgage Applications =United States= Many laws at both the Federal and state government level are aimed at preventing predatory lending. Although not specifically anti-predatory in nature, the Federal Truth in Lending Act requires certain disclosures of APR and loan terms. Also, in 1994 section 32 of the Truth in Lending Act, entitled the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994, was created. This law is devoted to identifying certain high- cost, potentially predatory mortgage loans and reining in their terms. Twenty- five states have passed anti-predatory lending laws. Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, North Carolina, New York, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Carolina are among those states considered to have the strongest laws. Other states with predatory lending laws include: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, and West Virginia. These laws usually describe one or more classes of \\"high-cost\\" or \\"covered\\" loans, which are defined by the fees charged to the borrower at origination or the APR. While lenders are not prohibited from making \\"high-cost\\" or \\"covered\\" loans, a number of additional restrictions are placed on these loans, and the penalties for noncompliance can be substantial.

He served as Mexico's Secretary of Economy from 2000 to 2002 and Secretary of Foreign Affairs from 2003 to 2006.  Early life and education  Luis Ernesto Derbez Bautista was born April 1, 1947 in Mexico City, Mexico. His parents were small business owners that ran a clothing factory that employed 20 workers. He has a Bachelor's degree in 1970 in economics, from the Universidad Aut√≥noma de San Luis Potos√≠, in San Luis Potos√≠ City. He studied at the University of Oregon and has a Master's degree in economics. He earned a Doctorate in economics in 1980 from the Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa.Iowa State University Alumni Association After graduating in 1980, Derbez was appointed vice rector for academics at the Universidad de las Am√©ricas Puebla in Puebla, Mexico. Before joining the Fox campaign in 1997, he worked 14 years for the World Bank, managing economic adjustment programs in Africa, Asia and Central America. He also was a visiting professor at the Johns Hopkins University, within the School of Advanced International Studies. He began is career in politics in 2000.  Political career  = Secretary of Economy = Upon assuming power in December 2000, President Vicente Fox chose him to serve as his Secretary of Economy. As Minister of Economy, Derbez was in charge of Mexico's international trade negotiations. In 2001, he finalized the trade agreement between China and Mexico which allowed China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), and led the Mexican team which defined the terms for a Free Trade Agreement between Mexico and Japan; in 2004 the FTA was signed. At the 2001 WTO's Ministerial Meetings in Qatar he was a member of the Director's Team which successfully negotiated the start of the Doha Development Round. Following his participation, Derbez became the Chairman- elect for WTO's 2003 Ministerial Meeting. As such, during 2002 and 2003 he co- chaired preparatory Ministerial Meetings in Mexico, Sydney, Geneva, Sharm-el- Sheik, and Paris. In September 2003, Derbez chaired the WTO Ministerial Meeting which produced the so named Cancun Text that served as the basic text for follow up negotiations at the 2005 WTO's Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting. During that period, Derbez also played a key role in the successful outcome of the U.N. International Conference on Financing for Development held in Monterrey, Mexico, where developed nations agreed to contribute 0.7% of its GDP in development aid by the year 2015. Derbez also chaired the 2002 APEC Meeting in Los Cabos, Baja California. In domestic issues, as Minister of Economy, Derbez proposed ten industrial policy programs for key sectors of the Mexican economy. By 2005, over $10 billion in new investments were attracted by those programs in the automotive, electronics, and maquiladora industries, allowing the nation to regain some of its presence in world markets despite the failure to reach structural economic reforms sought by the Fox government. He also created the Undersecretariat for Medium and Small Enterprises, and launched the successful Microcredit program PRONAFIM, which by 2005 had financed over 1.5 million microcredits. = Secretary of Foreign Affairs = In January 2003, following the resignation of Jorge Casta√±eda, Derbez took over as Secretary of Foreign Affairs, a position that he held until President Vicente Fox's term ended on December 1, 2006. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, Derbez has strengthened Mexico‚Äôs bilateral and multilateral relations with the USA and Canada. Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is a key player in the negotiations to improve NAFTA. Its work has led to a program entitled Security and Prosperity Agreement (ASPAN for its acronym in Spanish), launched in 2003 in Waco, Texas, by the three leaders of the North American countries. One of the major results of ASPAN was the constitution of a private-public Competitiveness Council which is defining sector specific policies to standardize the region's economic environment. Derbez has also played a key role in shaping the migration reform debate in the US by organizing and leading a group of 10 Latin American countries (from Mexico to Ecuador), which has presented a common position in discussions with key Senators and Representatives of the US Congress. Reversing a 15-year trend, Derbez has refocused Mexico's policy towards Latin America. At the sub-regional level, increased cooperation with the seven Central American countries has resulted in the creation of the Mesoamerican Group, which currently defines common sub- regional policies in energy development, border security, fight against organized crime, and regional infrastructure. Under Derbez's leadership, Mexico gained associated status in the Andean Countries Group and MERCOSUR, while at the same time signed a strategic, political, and economic alliance with Chile. On the other hand, he gave high priority to the Asia Pacific region. In addition to the FTA with Japan, Mexico created a Ministerial Level Commission with China, the only one of this kind that China has. Under his leadership, Mexico initiated negotiations agreements with India's government in the technology and pharmaceutical sectors. While representing Mexico at the UN Security Council during the Iraq crisis, Derbez realized that a major overhaul of the UN system was required. In 2004, Mexico invited 15 nations to form a group called Friends of the Reform, to propose administrative and organizational changes for the UN. He also organized another 16 nations into a group named United for a Consensus, to propose reforms to the UN Security Council. The proposals of both groups played a major role in the reform decisions approved by the UN Assembly on September 2005. Since January 2007, Luis Ernesto Derbez has been the General Director of the Centre for Globalization, Competitiveness and Democracy at the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey, Campus Santa Fe, and Secretary for International Affairs of the PAN. Between January 2003 and December 2006, he was the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Mexico; and between December 2000 and December 2002, he was the Minister of Economy. From July to November 2000, he chaired President-elect Vicente Fox transition team, which defined Mexico's 2000-2006 economic and social programs. Awards and memberships Derbez was a member of the Board of Directors of PEMEX and Pemex International (PMI), Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior (Bancomext), and Mexico's Science and Technology Council (CONACYT). In 2001 and 2002, he was Chairman of the Board for Exportadora de Sal, S.A. and Transportes de Sal, S.A., joint ventures between the Mexican Government and the Mitsubishi Corporation. He was granted by Iowa State University the Distinguished Achievement Alumni Award in 2006, the first time ever given to a non-US national.  Personal life  Derbez is married and has 2 daughters. He has published many articles and book chapters, and has lectured extensively in many countries. He speaks fluently Spanish, English and French. Derbez is a member of Sigma Xi and Phi Kappa Phi.

The airchain begins with cameras, microphones, CD players, turntables, telephone hybrids, video tape recorders, satellite and other remote feeds, and other input devices in the studio and control room. These feed into a mixing console, possibly via a router. The output then goes to an audio processor, and finally to the transmitter, feedline, and antenna. Often, there is a studio-transmitter link via radio or broadband dedicated circuit (usually T1 or E1 line). The airchain may be all-analogue, all-digital, or most likely some hybrid of the two. All-analog airchains typically use cables terminated in XLR connectors between each device. All-digital airchains also often use XLR connectors, except carrying AES/EBU digital audio instead.

Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc. is the second largest tax- preparation service in the United States; responsible for preparing over 2 million federal, state, and local income-tax returns each year. The company is based in Jersey City, New Jersey. It operated more than 6,000 franchised and company-owned locations throughout the United States, including nearly 3,000 located in Walmart stores nationwide.[jacksonhewitt.com/Our-Story] In January 1998, the Cendant Corporation, a consumer conglomerate, purchased Jackson Hewitt in a transaction valued at approximately $480 million. In 2004, Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc. was spun off as a separate company.. History = Foundation= Jackson Hewitt was founded in 1982. It was assembled by John Hewitt with a variety of investors who purchased the six-location, Norfolk, Virginia-based Mel Jackson's Tax Service and renamed it Jackson Hewitt.. For the next few years, the company grew slowly, adding a handful of additional outlets. =Expansion= In 1986, the same year the Internal Revenue Service first began to experiment with computerized tax filing, the company began selling franchises.. By the following tax season there were 22 offices. In October 1989, the Montgomery Ward department-store chain contracted with Jackson Hewitt to open offices in 169 stores across the United States. For years, Sears a competitor of Montgomery Ward had been host to H&R; Block in its stores. The sudden growth was too much for the company and to avoid entering bankruptcy during tax season, Jackson Hewitt closed 67 of those offices. However, by the end of 1990, the company had returned to profitability and opened more locations in Montgomery Ward stores. By 1992, Jackson Hewitt had 515 offices in almost 30 states and was preparing 311,000 returns for taxpayers per year, making it second-largest tax preparation chain in the United States. During the following year, the company raised funds for expansion and moved into new headquarters in Virginia Beach, Virginia. By 1993, the company had 900 offices in 37 states. In January 1994, the company went public but no new stock was issued; the company's 700 investors' private shares simply converted into public ones. During that same year, the company made a deal to set up offices in Sam's Club stores on a trial basis. The trial was a success, and later that year the company launched plans to establish eighteen offices in Walmart stores, leasing space for use as combined tax preparation and business mail service sites. =Cendant= In December 1997, Jackson Hewitt announced that it was being acquired by HFS Inc. for $480 million. Before the sale was complete, HFS merged with another firm and changed its name to Cendant Corporation. Cendant owned a number of franchise operations, ranging from Ramada Inn, Days Inn and Avis Car Rental to chains including Coldwell Banker and Century 21. Under Cendant, Jackson Hewitt opened a total of 1,000 new offices, and started experimenting with kiosk locations in shopping malls and offices at Century 21 real estate agencies. Following the 1999 tax season, Jackson Hewitt moved its headquarters to Cendant's headquarters in Parsippany, New Jersey, and started acquiring of independent tax preparation offices through its largest franchisee, Tax Services of America. Meanwhile, founder John Hewitt's Liberty Tax Service had grown into the third-largest tax preparation chain in the United States Starting in 2001, Jackson Hewitt began opening offices in Kmart stores. During that year, the company also introduced the issuance of MasterCard cash cards ‚Äì so that their customers would have easier access to accelerated refund accounts ‚Äì as well as the creation of a Premier Tax Service for complex returns. Some Jackson Hewitt locations began to offer ATMs where clients could cash their refund checks on- site. Independent tax-service acquisitions continued throughout the year, with more than 3,300 offices, owned by 600 franchisees.. By year's end, the company was handling over 2.2 million tax returns a year. At its peak, Jackson Hewitt was the second-largest tax preparation firm in the U.S., a position it still holds. The firm prepared some 3.4 million tax returns for low- and middle- income customers through more than 7,400 franchised company-owned offices, including locations within Kmart, Walmart Stores and mall kiosks. Jackson Hewitt maintained two business segments: its franchise operations ‚Äì consisting of its franchise business and associated royalty, marketing-advertising revenue, financial product fees and other revenues and its company owned income tax return preparation offices. During 2008, Jackson Hewitt maintained company-owned offices in 28 markets across the United States and 5,763 franchised offices ‚Äì responsible for preparing 87 percent of the total number of tax returns prepared by its network. Jackson Hewitt Inc. operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of Jackson Hewitt. Its company-owned office operations are conducted through a wholly owned subsidiary of Jackson Hewitt Tax Services Inc., Tax Services of America, Inc. In 2008, the company partnered with the Magic Johnson Foundation to create Community Empowerment Centers that offered comprehensive tax information seminars and financial educational resources in Sacramento, Houston, Chicago, New Orleans and Cleveland. The free seminars offered individuals in underserved communities basic tax information and budget-planning resources. For example, each attendee received free access to the Jackson Hewitt Money Manager, a Web-based home budgeting tool that helps users create and manage a budget and a detailed savings plan. Default In May 2009, the company negotiated out of a default on its debt and technically defaulted for several days in May 2010 (although an agreement with creditors was announced within one week of the \\"default\\").20. On May 4, 2011, the company announced it had agreed to a twenty-day extension of its debt under its various credit agreements with Wachovia/Wells Fargo Bank. The company mentioned at that time that it was considering many options including a prepackaged bankruptcy filing. On May 20, 2011, the extension expired and the company had yet to file for bankruptcy protection or to announce another extension of its debt. On May 7, 2011, Jackson Hewitt ceased being traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The ending share price was $.19. On May 9, 2011, its stock symbol was changed from JTX to JHTX and began trading on a different stock exchange. On May 24, 2011, Jackson Hewitt officially filed for bankruptcy. In August 2011, Jackson Hewitt became a privately held company with Philip Sanford as its president, chief executive officer and a member of the board of directors. Investigation On April 3, 2007, the United States Justice Department announced that the federal government had filed civil injunction suits alleging tax fraud by five corporations owned or partly owned by Farrukh Sohail. According to the four lawsuits filed in federal courts in Chicago, Atlanta, Detroit and Raleigh, the corporations operate under franchise agreements with Jackson Hewitt Tax Services Inc. On September 28, 2007, the Department of Justice announced that it had reached settlements with each of the defendants in the case. Under the settlement agreements, the majority owner, Farrukh Sohail, of each of the businesses was to be barred from preparing tax returns for five years, and roughly fifteen of Sohail's employees were permanently enjoined from preparing tax returns. Neither Sohail nor his incorporated businesses were to pay any financial penalties under the settlement agreement, indicating that the fraud committed was not done with the consent of senior management in Sohail's business. On September 6, 2007, Jackson Hewitt said that its internal review found no evidence its employees knew of the scheme that led to U.S. Department of Justice lawsuits. The internal review, led by former IRS Commissioner Fred Goldberg: \\"...did not find evidence of corporate employee participation in, or knowledge of, the allegedly fraudulent tax return preparation activities.\\" Post-2007 Jackson Hewitt is led by Gregory J Macfarlane, Chief Executive Officer, who joined the company in June of 2020. The company was acquired by Corsair Capital in 2018. Jackson Hewitt has a strong retail presence and has re-emerged after bankruptcy as the second-largest and fastest growing tax preparation company in America, having been named Vendor of the Year for Walmart. During the 2013 tax season, it expanded its presence into Sears throughout the U.S. and Puerto Rico. on January 7, 2015 Jackson Hewitt unveiled its new brand logo and slogan \\"Working hard for the hardest working\\" and the return of refund anticipation loans with 0% interest and no credit check. Products and services =Tax- return preparation= Jackson Hewitt provides its customers with tax-return preparation services and electronic filing. Through the use of its tax software, ProFiler, the company provides computerized federal income tax preparation, state income tax, and individual tax preparation services to customers through its brick-and-mortar operations. In 2014, Jackson Hewitt and Tax Preparer Solutions partnered to provide online federal and state preparation and e-filing services through the Jackson Hewitt website.. =Franchise sales= The company supports more than 5,763 franchise locations throughout the United States. Start-up costs range from around $50,000 to $100,000 per franchise. Jackson Hewitt offers support to franchise owners for approved Jackson Hewitt products, software, and computer hardware. The company offers an online Support Center, as well as staff trained to respond to software and technology needs. The online Support Center also provides remote assistance, email, chat and telephone support. Furthermore, in tax year 2005 Jackson Hewitt unveiled its new ESS scan system which enables paperless uploading of customer documents to its secure server. =Tax School= Jackson Hewitt offers \\"Tax School\\" throughout the country with two ways to learn: in a classroom or online, through the University of Phoenix.

Northfleet has its own railway station on the North Kent Line, just east of Ebbsfleet International railway station on the High Speed 1 line. The area Northfleet's name is derived from being situated on the northern reach of what was once called the River Fleet (today known as the Ebbsfleet River). There is a village at the other end of the river named Southfleet. It has been the site of a settlement on the shore of the River Thames adjacent to Gravesend since Roman times. It was known as Fleote by the Saxons c. 600 AD, Flyote c. 900 AD, and Flete c. 1000 AD. It was recorded as Norfluet in the Domesday Book, and Northflet in 1201. By 1610 the name of Northfleet had become established. A battle took place during the Civil War at the Stonebridge over the Ebbsfleet river. Northfleet became a town in 1874 with the Northfleet Urban District Council being established c. 1894. In 1974 it was merged with the adjacent Borough of Gravesend. The first council offices were off the Hill, but the council then moved to Northfleet House (now a nursing home for the elderly). Northfleet House was once the home of Thomas Sturge who owned a local cement works.Howard, Mark (August 2015). \\"Thomas Sturge and his fleet of South Sea whalers,\\" International Journal of Maritime History, 27(3):421-2. Northfleet was in the lathe of Aylesford and the hundred of Toltingtrough. Romans lived in the area now known as Springhead, which they called Vagniacae. Springhead, the source of the Ebbsfleet River, was the first site in Britain where watercress was grown commercially in the early 19th century. Watling Street, a Roman road which forms the basis of the A2 from London to Dover, bisects the area. History =Rosherville Gardens= In 1815 the first steamboat started plying between Gravesend, Kent, and London, an event which was to bring much prosperity to the area. The number of visitors steadily increased, and in the course of the next ten years several new and rival steam packets were started. The regular service given by the steam packets led entrepreneurs to establish amenities for the entertainment of visitors, one of which was Rosherville Gardens. George Jones laid out the gardens in 1837 in one of the disused chalk pits, covering an area of 17 acres (69,000 m¬≤). Their full title was the 'Kent Zoological and Botanical Gardens Institution'. They occupied an area in what was to become Rosherville New Town (see below). Robert Hiscock, in his A History of Gravesend (Phillimore, 1976) describes them thus: > They were a place of surpassing beauty and a favourite resort of Londoners. > Adorned with small Greek temples and statuary set in the cliffs, there were > terraces, and archery lawn, Bijou theatre, and Baronial Hall for > refreshments, and at one time a lake. At night the gardens were illuminated > with thousands of coloured lights and there were fireworks displays and > dancing. Famous bands such as the American Sousa were engaged during the > season. Blondin, the trapeze artist, performed ... In 1857 as many as 20,000 > visitors passed through the turnstiles in one week. By 1880 the gardens had > reached the peak of their popularity ... in 1901 they were closed. During a > brief revival 1903‚Äì1911, they were used in the making of early films. A pier was built to carry these crowds ashore, and a railway station opened on the Gravesend West branch railway. It was one of the steamboats from Rosherville Gardens that was involved in a horrific accident in 1878. The passenger steamer, after leaving Rosherville pier, was in a collision with the collier Bywell Castle, from Woolwich. 640 people died from the collision, 240 being children. An inquest was held at Woolwich, but no conclusive reason was ever established as to the cause of the disaster at the Devils Elbow on the Thames. =Rosherville New Town= New builds in Rosherville in 2008 Joseph Rosher gave his name to a building scheme which began with the building of new houses in 1830. A prospectus states that ' this spot will ultimate become to Gravesend what St Leonards is to Hastings and Broadstairs to Margate'. That grandiose scheme did not materialise in quite that way, but the area of Northfleet still bears that name. =Northfleet Harbour= Northfleet Harbour is formed from a natural river inlet of the River Ebbsfleet into the Thames. The Harbour formed over solid chalk, and created a marine facility that was originally used by the Romans. Remains of Roman buildings have been found further up the River Ebbsfleet, and during the High Speed 1 railway works, evidence of Saxon occupation was also found. By the 18th century, a flour mill was placed within the Harbour, and later it was home to the cement industry. A local community Trust is now aiming to restore the harbour and bring it back into public use. =Northfleet during the Second World War= On Friday, 16 August 1941 150 German aircraft flew through the Kent skies, to deal the worst blow to civilian life the county had experienced to that point in the war. With the formation splitting into groups to be variously challenged from Manston, Kenley, Hornchurch, Biggin Hill and Hawkinge airfields, a group of Dorniers made it to Northfleet a little after midday. They dropped about 106 bombs ranging from 50‚Äì250 kilos over the town. The bombs killed 29 people, injured 27, and badly damaged two schools. Governance Northfleet Urban District Council was set up under the Local Government Act of 1894. Within its boundaries were the hamlets of Northfleet Green and Nash Street, as well as the now built-up Perry Street; and the later estates at Shears Green, Istead Rise and Downs Road. Northfleet was merged, inter alia, with Gravesend to become Gravesham District Council on 1 April 1974. Industry and commerce Cement works on the Thames estuary With its situation on a busy waterway such as the River Thames, at a point where higher land came close to the river, it was an obvious place for industry to be located. The river provided water supplies and the means whereby raw materials and products could be transported. The forests of the area provided timber for various aspects of most industries. It was an area famous for Gun Flint manufacturing as Flint is found in amongst the Chalk. Flint was also used as a local building material. Flint walls can still be found in the area. The Springhead/Ebbsfleet Valley area was used for the growing of Watercress much of which was supplied to the London market. =Cement= On the quay at Northfleet Cement Works in Dec 2008 The Romans first began to dig chalk from the area, but the making of cement came later. The industry requires plentiful water supplies, and chalk as its main ingredient, both of which were to hand. When in 1796, James Parker set up kilns on Northfleet creek to make his Roman cement, it was the beginning of a large complex of cement works along this stretch of the river.A J Francis, The Cement Industry 1796‚Äì1914: a History, David & Charles, 1977, The manufacture of Portland cement began in April 1846 when William Aspdin, son of Joseph Aspdin, its inventor, acquired Parker's works and built new kilns. Aspdin's works became Robins & Co in 1853, sold on to the Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers (APCM) in 1900, which was taken over by the Lafarge Group in 2001. By 1900, there were nine cement works operating on the Thames between Swanscombe and Gravesend. The last cement plant in Northfleet ceased operation in 2008. Now under water, one of the largest chalk pits, known locally as The Blue Lake, can be found between the A226 and the North Kent Railway line. It is about 200 metres south of the access tunnel to the old (now demolished) Lafarge cement plant, that runs under the North Kent / Channel Tunnel rail- link railway lines. =Paper= Northfleet is the location of a large Bowaters (later Bowater-Scott and Kimberly-Clark) paper mill built in 1923 and makes all of the main ‚Äì line Andrex toilet tissue. =Metals= Britannia Refined Metals (now part of the Glencore group) has a refinery producing lead and silver. =Northfleet Dockyard= Northfleet was by 1800 the home of numerous shipyards which had produced many fine vessels. One such yard was owned by Thomas Pitcher, a shipwright, laid out in 1788. A list of merchant vessels built at his yard included at least 25 ships for the East Indies and West Indies services, and about the same number for the Navy. There is a fine model of such a ship in St. Botolph's Church. The first was , an East Indiaman of 1252 tons burthen (bm), built for the Honourable East India Company.Lewis (1831), Vol. 3, p.403. In 1839 the company was in the hands of Pitcher's sons William and Henry. The docks were in decline by 1843, and Pilcher's yard finally closed in 1860. =Cable works= Henley's Another large employee of labour in Northfleet was the cable works. Originally Henley's, now AEI, they occupied the land originally once used by the Rosherville Gardens. The PLUTO pipeline used in WW2 was built here. AEI Cables closed in 2005 and Henley moved in 2006. The Henley works as of 2010 is completely demolished, and currently an entirely empty site. Transport Northfleet has its own railway station, which opened in 1849 as part of the extension of the North Kent Line from Gravesend to London. All train services at the station are operated by Southeastern. =Ebbsfleet International station= Ebbsfleet International railway station, on the High Speed 1 line (also known as the Channel Tunnel Rail Link), is located less than a mile from Northfleet. Ebbsfleet International is served by Eurostar trains and by Southeastern's Javelin trains, both running to and from London St Pancras. A design flaw that exists in Ebbsfleet International is its lack of pedestrian connections to Northfleet. Although the station's domestic passenger entrance is within a quarter of a mile of Northfleet's local station, the walking distance between the two is greater, hindering the advantage of living in Northfleet over nearby Gravesend, which is served by Southeastern's Javelin trains. Education Non-selective secondary schools serving Northfleet include Northfleet School for Girls and Northfleet Technology College (Boys). Northfleet churches St Botolph's The ancient parish church of Northfleet (dating from the 14th century, but with work from earlier periods) is dedicated to St Botolph. Its tower was built in 1717, after the original had fallen. The church contains a 14th-century carved oak screen, which is thought to be the oldest in Kent. Rosherville St Mark's Church is now part of the Team ministry with St. Botolph's church. The other active church in Northfleet is All Saints, Perry Street which is Anglo Catholic. All Saints Perry Street is the largest Anglican parish in Gravesham Borough with a quarter of the Gravesham population living within its boundaries. The Roman Catholic ChurchThe Roman Catholic church, Our Lady Of The Assumption designed by Giles Gilbert Scott and with its tower foreshadowing his Liverpool Cathedral, is built entirely of brown brick. It was constructed in 1914 on the site of a former Tram Depot. During WW2, and the blitz, the German Air Force used the tower of the Church as a guide into London. The pilots used the tower as a reference point for direct access into London. There a United Reformed Church (URC) on Dover Road in Northfleet. The Dover Road Chapel was opened on Wednesday 20 June 1850 as a Congregational Church. Northfleet URC is grouped with three other churches in the North Kent URC group. These are St Paul's URC, Singlewell Road, Gravesend; Hartley URC and Southfleet URC. Culture and community =Rotary Club in Northfleet= The Rotary Club of Northfleet was founded in 1954 and chartered as the Rotary Club of Northfleet ‚Äì Club No 793 in R.I.B.I. District 1120. The club originally had members from many local industries (cement, engineering, paper making etc.), but as these industries declined along the river front, so membership changed. The club used to meet at lunchtime for many years, but this changed to evening meetings a few years ago. Northfleet Rotary Club, like most Rotary clubs also voted to accept women into Rotary membership, which is by invitation. The club's name was changed in 2005 to Northfleet with Ebbsfleet Rotary Club, to reflect the emerging growth of nearby Ebbsfleet area, with its developing infrastructure of Bluewater shopping complex, new High Speed Rail terminal at Ebbsfleet Station, and commercial and residential properties being developed as part of the wider development the Thames Gateway project. Sports =Ebbsfleet United Football Club= The Fleet's Stadium Although one would suppose Gravesend to be the main influence in the history of this club, as it was listed first when the towns' clubs merged, it was in fact Northfleet that was to be responsible for the early significant accomplishment of the association football club now known as Ebbsfleet United F.C. Ebbsfleet are currently in the National league under manager Garry Hill Star players are Danny Kedwell and Nathan Ashmore =Northfleet Football Academy= Northfleet Football Academy was started in 2009 by local school Northfleet Technology College. Northfleet Football Academy was designed to recruit the elite of Graveshams football players and give them the best possible coaching to help them develop as players. It also offers its participants the opportunity to take a BTEC in Sports and one other additional subject like Science to help the players gain nationally recognised qualifications at key stage 4 whilst the players develop their playing skills. The academy is run by Northfleet Technology College teachers Brian Meaney (manager) and Lisa Donaldson (chairman) and also boasts the professional coaching of former Welsh International and current Ashford Town manager Steve Lovell (Welsh footballer) The Academy is based in Colyer Road, Northfleet. =Fleet Leisure Football Club= Fleet Leisure F.C. are a Non-League football team who play in the Kent Invicta Football League. The team was originally based at Nelson Road, but currently groundshares with Rochester United F.C.. =Gravesham Borough Football Club= Gravesham Borough F.C. are a non-League football team who play in the Southern Counties East Football League. The team was originally based at Nelson Road, but currently groundshares with Chatham Town F.C. =Northfleet Urban Country Park= Northfleet Urban Country Park sits on the eastern side of Northfleet, on Thames Way opposite the new police station, bounded by Springhead Road & Vale Road. The site is 10.5 hectares and provides a variety of wildlife habitats.

Although they are avid genre-hoppers, they are often categorized as indie rock. History The band was formed in 1996 by synthesizer-player/vocalist David James Swanson, bassist Steve Damstra, and drummer Brad Holland, all sixteen years old at the time. The band's name originates from the cover art done by Raymond Pettibon for Sonic Youth's 1990 release Goo. They played their first show on March 17, 1997. In 1999 the group was joined by guitarist Jason Eberspeaker and released a 45, continuing to play gigs around Michigan. One such gig was attended by Jack White of The White Stripes, who offered to record them. On June 20, 2000, the same day as the release of the White Stripes' album De Stijl, Whirlwind Heat recorded a handful of songs in White's attic studio. A single entitled \\"Glaxefusion\\" was released on Italy Records soon after, as well as a track on White's 2001 compilation, Sympathetic Sounds of Detroit released by Sympathy Records. Eberspeaker soon left the band to follow a career in fine arts. In August 2002, over a brief four-day period, the remaining trio recorded what would be the debut album not only for the band, but for White's label collaboration with V2 Records, Third Man Records. (White also produced the album.) The album, Do Rabbits Wonder?, was released on Third Man Records with distribution by V2 Records and XL Recordings on April 15, 2003, as well as later releasing a cover of the White Stripes song \\"You're Pretty Good Looking\\" for the soundtrack of The Hot Chick. The music video for the single \\"Purple\\" was shot by fashion/celebrity photographer Terry Richardson in New Paltz, NY. The video featured models Susan Eldridge and Kemp Muhl. In 2004 the band released a short EP entitled Flamingo Honey, written and recorded in five hours. The EP features ten songs, all approximately one minute in length. The band's second full-length album Types of Wood was released on April 24, 2006 in the UK by Brille Records. The album photos of model Susan Eldridge were shot by Terry Richardson . Types of Wood has 11 tracks including the singles Reagan which also features on the Reagan EP. Along with the release of the album, the band filmed a video for each song. The video for Reagan was directed by Matthew Gray Gubler who cast his younger brother in the video as a fourth member of the band. Whirlwind Heat's last live performance was at Summer Sonic Festival in Tokyo, Japan on August 13, 2006. In 2007 Whirlwind Heat collaborated with Devonte Hynes (of the now defunct Test Icicles, Lightspeed Champion, and currently Blood Orange) and called the project Lightspeed Heat. The band self-released Self Titled or Scoop Du Jour on July 4, 2008, under their own record label imprint Heat Enterprises. The artwork was screen-printed in black ink on a sticker and applied to a blank white LP sleeve. The ice cream in the design was then colored green with a marker. The model on the cover is Erin Wasson and was photographed by Terry Richardson. Illustrations of the band members and art were done by actor/director/artist Matthew Gray Gubler. On April 19, 2014 Record Store Day, Whirlwind Heat performed in the blue room at Third Man Records in Nashville, TN. The first time on stage since playing in 2006 at Summer Sonic Festival in Tokyo, Japan. It was likely their last performance. Their debut album, Do Rabbits Wonder? was reissued, in a variety of colored vinyl.

The loan term was usually about two to three weeks, related to the time it took the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to deposit refunds in electronic accounts. The loans were designed to make the refund available in as little as 24 hours. They were secured by a taxpayer's expected tax refund, and designed to offer customers quicker access to funds. The costs to the borrower could be significant compared to other lending and some consumer organizations warned consumers of the risk involved in this type of loan. They are a largely discontinued financial product and beginning with the 2013 tax filing season, they have been largely replaced with the similar refund anticipation checks (RAC),Refund Anticipation Loans Come With Risks, Better Business Bureau, 2/26/2013. ' . . The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has forced all major national banks to discontinue these types of loans. Be wary of sketchy lenders, both online and off. . 'Tax refund offers include extra fees, KGET [California], Feb. 7, 2013. ' . . \\"They have to disclose all the fees so make sure you carefully read any papers that you sign, giving them rights to your refund, because that's exactly what you're doing,\\" said Hudson [Katy Hudson, Consumer Credit Counseling Services President]. . ' as well as a hodge podge of other financial products.New tax refund loans carry sky-high fees and rates, CNNMoney, Blake Ellis, March 6, 2013. RACs are temporary accounts which wait for the client's IRS tax refund, and which also provides a way for the client to pay for tax preparation out of the refund. Both financial products have similar fees and similar risks of third-party bank \\"cross-collection\\". A similar process in Canada to a RAL is termed \\"tax rebate discounting\\". United States In the United States prior to the 2013 tax filing season, taxpayers could apply for a refund anticipation loan through a paid professional tax preparation service, where a fee is typically charged for the preparation of the tax return. Internal Revenue Service rules prohibit basing this fee on the amount of the expected refund. An additional fee was usually charged for the services of originating a bank product and establishing a short-term bank account. By law this fee must be the same on both loan and non-loan bank products, and in 2004 the average fee was $32. The bank through which the loan was made charges finance charges. According to the National Consumer Law Center, 12 million taxpayers used a RAL in 2004. With e-filing and IRS partnerships that help consumers e-file for free, U.S. taxpayers can generally receive their tax refunds within three weeks and sometimes as quickly as ten to fourteen days if they choose to receive their refund via direct deposit. As of 2017, 70% of US taxpayers have access to free e-file and tax preparation services. This rendered RALs less attractive to some. History RALs began in 1985 when Ronald Smith, an Accountant in Virginia Beach, VA started the practice of Refund Advance Loans at his accounting firm, Action Accounting & Taxes located at 5441 Virginia Beach Blvd. This service of Loans On Tax Refunds was advertised widely through WYAH, TV and on Cox Cable in the Hampton Roads area by Action Accounting & Taxes in 1985, 1986 and 1987. The Advance Refund Loans became a huge business success from the start and a sensation in the area in 1986 and 1987 and was the first and only firm in the United States that was offering that service according to the IRS. In 1986 a salesman from Charlie Falk's Auto on Virginia Beach Blvd, where today Town Centre now exits, asked Mr. Smith if they could make an arrangement where Action Accounting & Taxes could prepare taxes for customers seeking to purchase cars in order to supplement their down payments on used or new car purchases. Mr. Smith agreed to this idea and that was the beginning of Loans on Tax Refunds being used in conjunction with car financing and that practice then quickly spread throughout the area and then throughout the entire United States. Mr. Smith was the first one to invent, organize and pioneer the process of Tax Refund Loans in this way and went on to make millions in this business. The financing was originally fully handled by Joel S. Coplon and Company, a small private financing company closely connected with Mr. Smith at the time. Action Accounting and Taxes, the firm that Mr. Smith owned, was one mile from where John Hewitt was just starting a new business venture. Mr. Hewitt had just recently purchased Mel Jackson's Tax Service which was a run down group of offices throughout the Hampton Road's area. Mr. Hewitt began to offer Refund Anticipation Loans in 1988 and built a national franchise out of the idea which funded and built Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. Then in 1989 H & R Block joined in the industry and it became a billion dollar industry across the United States being coopted into thousands of different accounting firms and tax practices across the United States and abroad. It was reported in 1989 that H & R Block had doubled its business at over 4,000 locations due to the introduction of this new Refund Loan Service. It later spread to Canada as well through Liberty Tax Service and in time this company moved into the United States market as well offering the same service. The proliferation of this tax loan practice coincided with the introduction of electronic filing which IRS introduced electronic filing as a way to decrease its cost of operation. Previous to this time refunds would take on average two to three months to come back from the IRS which is why the Loan on Tax Refund also known as Refund Anticipations Loan business flourished. In 1988, Mr. Smith as well as Mr. Coplon were jointly sued by the Attorney General of Virginia in a Richmond State Court for charging usurious interest. Mr. Smith was eventually dismissed from the case and it was reported by the State's Attorney at the time that the reason for his dismissal from the case was that Mr. Smith was \\"not culpable\\".(WAVY TV News, \\"Action Accounting\\", April 20‚Äì28, 1987),(Virginian Pilot & Ledger Starr, Sept. 21, 1987, Action Accounting & Tax Service), (USA Today, \\"Joel S. Coplon\\", Oct. 6, 1988). (Wall Street Journal, \\"H & R Block Doubled Business With Tax Refund Loan Offer\\", April 25, 1989). A tax preparer would, within 24 hours of submission, receive from the IRS confirmation that the submission was free of mathematical errors, and that the filer had no liens or delinquent federal student loans. This meant that there was good chance that the IRS would pay the refund within weeks, barring fraudulent income reporting. At that point the preparer would issue the filer a check for the amount of the expected refund minus a commission. In 1995, The New York Times reported that Beneficial's $30 electronic filing fee and $59 loan fee amounted to a 250 percent APR on a refund of $1,000. Exploitation of the system had begun by the early 1990s; filers misreported their income to inflate their refund. As a result of this, and also to discourage filers from this rather uneconomical offer, in 1994 the IRS stopped providing tax preparers a confirmation that a deposit would take place for a certain amount and that it would begin sending refunds directly to taxpayers instead of banks that made the loan, but not having the desired effects, the confirmations were re-instated the following year. Controversy According to the Consumer Federation of America and the National Consumer Law Center, RALs are controversial because, like payday loans and title loans, RALs are high- profit, low-risk loans marketed toward the working poor. A 2006 study by the NCLC and the Consumer Federation of America found that \\"Based upon the prices for RALs in 2006, a consumer can expect to pay about $100 in order to get a RAL for the average refund of about $2,150 from a commercial tax preparation chain this year\\". Opponents of RALs, like the National Consumer Law Center, argue that the profit motive of the lender results in RALs being issued too often to low-income individuals who are made to believe the wait for their refund is longer than it really is, who do not realize they are taking a loan, do not understand the high interest rates charged by the loan (often exceeding 100% APR until the last two tax filing seasons), and who do not actually need the funds immediately. Third-party cross-collection of bank debt (\\"previous debt\\") for both RALs and RACs As part of applying for both financial products, the client is directing his or her refund to the account-issuing bank. Cross-collection occurs in cases where the bank uses this occasion to collect debt owed another bank. As the IRS Taxpayer Advocate described the practice in 2006: \\"if a taxpayer owes money on a defaulted RAL to Bank A and subsequently attempts to buy another RAL from Bank B, Bank B is authorized to collect the outstanding debt from the RAL proceeds, transmit the funds to Bank A\\".National Taxpayer Advocate‚Äôs 2007 Objectives Report to Congress, Volume II, The Role Of The IRS In The Refund Anticipation Loan Industry, IRS, page 10, June 30, 2006. It is somewhat unclear how broad is the type of debt for which banks cross-collect. This practice is often not adequately disclosed to the tax preparation client. As a lawsuit filing against H&R; Block by the California Attorney General in February 2006 stated, \\"H&R; Block does not adequately tell such customers about any alleged debts, or that when they sign the new RAL application, they agree to automatic debt collection‚Äîincluding collection on alleged RAL-related debts from other tax preparers or banks. These applications are denied, and the customer's anticipated refund is used to pay off the debt, plus a fee\\".Attorney General Lockyer Files Lawsuit Against H&R; Block for Illegally Marketing and Selling High-Cost Loans as ‚ÄòInstant' Tax Refunds, News Release, Office of the Attorney General, State of California, Bill Lockyer, (former) Attorney General, Edmund G. Brown Jr., (current) Attorney General, Feb. 15, 2006. Tax prep firms often vaguely refer to this practice merely as \\"previous debt\\". This risk exists even if the client is only using the RAC account for purposes of taking the tax preparation fees out of the refund. Jan. 2011: IRS will not be providing \\"debt indicator\\" On August 5, 2010, the IRS announced that for the upcoming 2011 tax filing season, the agency would no longer be providing preparers and associated financial institutions with the \\"debt indicator\\" (a one-letter code that discloses whether or not the taxpayer owes back taxes and whether or not the taxpayer owes federally collected obligations such as child support, student loans, etc.).IRS to end release of taxpayer debt information, EILEEN AJ CONNELLY (Associated Press), Friday, August 6, 2010.IRS Removes Debt Indicator for 2011 Tax Filing Season, (IRS news release), IR-2010-89, Aug. 5, 2010. Taxpayers themselves will continue to have access to information about their refund through the \\"Where's My Refund?\\" feature at the irs.gov website. In the same news release, the IRS stated it was exploring ways to allow filers to directly split off part of the refund to pay for professional tax preparation, possibly starting in January 2012. The IRS is asking for input from filers, consumer advocates, and those in the tax preparation community regarding whether this would be cost-effective. Jan. 2013: Major U.S. banks stop offering RALs Beginning with the 2013 tax season, major U.S. banks will no longer be offering RALs. They will instead be offering the similar financial products of RACs, which are not loans but are rather temporary accounts which sit empty waiting for the client's IRS refund.

She is currently the lead vocalist of Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish. Jansen first became known as a member of symphonic metal band After Forever, standing as their lead vocalist from 1997, when she joined at age 16, to their disbanding in 2009. When After Forever disbanded, she formed ReVamp and has released two albums with them. In 2012 following the departure of their lead vocalist Anette Olzon, Nightwish brought in Jansen as a touring member until the end of their Imaginaerum World Tour. In 2013, they announced Jansen was now their full-time lead vocalist; she subsequently disbanded ReVamp to focus on Nightwish. In 2018, she and Pagan's Mind guitarist J√∏rn Viggo Lofstad premiered their hard rock duo Northward. A frequent collaborator of Arjen Anthony Lucassen, Jansen is a member of his progressive metal supergroup Star One, and sang in the Ayreon albums Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer, 01011001, and The Source, as well as the live album Ayreon Universe ‚Äì The Best of Ayreon Live. She also sang lead vocals in several songs of the MaYan album Quarterpast and in Avalon's Angels of the Apocalypse. She is the older sister of fellow singer Irene Jansen, who also worked with Ayreon. Biography =After Forever (1997‚Äì2009)= Jansen was sixteen when she joined Apocalypse (later known as After Forever) in 1997. Three years later the band released its first album, Prison of Desire. Her ability to sing both classical and rock music has made her reasonably popular in the metal scene. She took sole charge of After Forever's lyrics and vocal melodies since the departure of Mark Jansen (no relation) in 2002. Prior to this, up until the Decipher (2001) album, the two would write together. Before becoming a full-time musician, she worked as a singing teacher. Jansen with After Forever at the Masters of Rock festival in 2007 Because of the burnout that After Forever bandmate Sander Gommans underwent, the band took a year off starting in January 2008 but ultimately decided to call it quits in February 2009. Jansen posted on her website, that while After Forever was on hold (and since then disbanded), she would use this opportunity to start writing music with J√∏rn Viggo Lofstad (Pagan's Mind, J√∏rn Lande) for a new musical project; the two would not be able to make the project come to fruition at the time due to their respective busy schedules, but would eventually reunite in 2017 to give birth to the project as Northward. On 16 June 2009, Jansen announced through her MySpace site, that she had started a new metal band, which has put the project called Sinh with Lofstad on hold. =ReVamp (2009‚Äì2016)= On 17 October 2009, Jansen announced via MySpace, that the name of her new band was ReVamp. ReVamp's first album was produced with After Forever keyboardist Joost van den Broek, bass player Jaap Melman (formerly of Dreadlock Pussy) and guitarist Waldemar Sorychta (Grip Inc., Voodoocult, Eyes of Eden and Despair) as songwriters and producers. The final line-up of ReVamp featured keyboardist Ruben Wijga, bass player Jaap Melman, guitarists Jord Otto and Arjan Rijnen and drummer Matthias Landes. ReVamp performing live in Oslo in September 2010 In August 2011, Van Canto announced on Facebook, that ReVamp would no longer participate in their Out of the Dark tour, as Jansen suffered a burnout herself. In late 2011, Jansen joined her former bandmate in After Forever Mark Jansen for his band MaYan's Latin American tour, performing in S√£o Paulo. In 2012, Jansen joined Adrenaline Mob on stage in Bochum and Weert. ReVamp's second album, Wild Card, was released in 2013. ReVamp announced its breakup in September 2016, citing Floor Jansen's inability to deliver 100% to both ReVamp and Nightwish. =Nightwish (2012‚Äìpresent)= After Nightwish's previous lead vocalist Anette Olzon parted ways with the band, Jansen acted as Nightwish's live lead vocalist for the remainder of the Imaginaerum World Tour in 2012. She was at her sister's wedding when she received the call to replace Olzon. Her first show with the band was in Seattle in October. When commenting on the experience, she said: On 9 October 2013, Jansen was announced as Olzon's permanent replacement in the band, following an invitation she received from the band in a hotel bar. In 2015, Nightwish released their first studio album featuring Jansen as the lead vocalist, Endless Forms Most Beautiful. Out of this tour came the live album Vehicle of Spirit which is the second live album to feature Floor. The second studio album with Jansen as lead vocalist, Human. :II: Nature., was released on April 10, 2020. = Other works = Three albums by the Dutch composer and multi-instrumentalist Arjen Anthony Lucassen's project Ayreon include guest vocals from Jansen: she sang backing vocals on \\"My House on Mars\\" from the album Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer, played the character of Forever (referred to as Œ©) on seven songs from the album 01011001, and was featured as a character named The Biologist on the album The Source. She is also a member of Lucassen's heavy metal supergroup Star One, and was featured on the studio albums Space Metal and Victims of the Modern Age. She was also featured in the 2018 live album Ayreon Universe ‚Äì The Best of Ayreon Live. On 9 December 2013, she was also announced as the main vocalist, playing the lead role, for the second full-length album of former Stratovarius guitarist Timo Tolkki's metal opera act Avalon. The album, Angels of the Apocalypse, was released on 16 May 2014. She has also been a guest for the metal band Nightmare. On 22 February 2018, Northward, a hard rock project by Jansen and Pagan's Mind guitarist J√∏rn Viggo Lofstad, was unveiled. The two created the project in 2007, writing an entire album worth of music in 2008 but being unable to record previously due to their busy schedules; they ultimately reunited in 2017 to finally record the album, which was released on 19 October 2018 under their signed label Nuclear Blast. The album features a duet between Jansen and her sister Irene. In 2019, Jansen participated in the Dutch TV-show Beste Zangers (\\"Best Singers\\"). During all episodes she impressed her fellow singers, but also the TV-audience with her voice. In the last episode she partnered with classical singer Henk Poort to perform Phantom of the Opera. The single of that performance reached the number one position in Dutch charts. That performance generated so much attention that she decided to plan a solo tour in the Netherlands. All venues were sold out. She also won the \\"Popprijs 2019\\" - a prestigious Dutch award for the artist or band with an important contribution to Dutch pop music in the past year. Personal life As a child, she wanted to be a biologist; coincidentally, she played the character \\"The Biologist\\" in the Ayreon album The Source. On 18 September 2016, it was announced, that Jansen and her husband Hannes Van Dahl, drummer of Sabaton, were expecting their first child. On 15 March 2017, Jansen announced via Instagram that she gave birth to a baby girl, Freja. Jansen is vegetarian. In 2018, a new species of beetle was discovered by scientist Andreas Weigel. It was named after Jansen, dubbing it Tmesisternus floorjansenae. This makes Floor Jansen the second Nightwish member to be a namesake for a newly discovered species, as a new kind of fungus gnat was discovered back in 2017 by Finnish biologist Jukka Salmela, who named the species after Tuomas Holopainen. Jansen herself announced the news on Facebook. Singing style Jansen can sing from classical to belting and raspy vocals like screaming and death growls. She is a soprano with a range of more than three octaves (D3 tot F6). Jansen started studying music at the Dutch Rock Academy in 1999, entering the Conservatorium Tilburg three years later. She studied musical theatre and a year of opera. After After Forever split up she started teaching performing in her own course called Wanna be a Star?! She used to play the guitar, piano and flute and has completed several years of music studies.

He is a Kazakh journalist and is the main protagonist of the mockumentary Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006) and its upcoming sequel Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2020). Borat's humour arises from his espousal of outrageous sociocultural viewpoints, his violation of social taboos, and his use of vulgar language and behaviour. Entertainment Weekly put the film on its end-of-the-decade, \\"best-of\\" list, saying, \\"The Kazakhstani journalist gave us some of the most incisive cultural commentary ever filmed.

Entertainment Weekly. (1079/1080):74‚Äì84 Origins The character was first developed for short skits on F2F on Granada Television that Baron Cohen presented in 1996‚Äì1997, with the character at this time being known as Alexi Krickler. The character, now known as Kristo Shqiptari, was picked up by Paramount Comedy 1 and subsequently by BBC Two's Comedy Nation. Alexi and Kristo were nearly identical in looks and demeanor to the later incarnation, although Alexi claimed to be Moldovan and Kristo claimed to be Albanian rather than coming from Kazakhstan. The character remained dormant while Baron Cohen concentrated on his Ali G persona for Channel 4's The 11 O'Clock Show, but with the subsequent success of Ali G and the creation of Da Ali G Show (also on Channel 4) Baron Cohen revisited his Borat character. Fictional character biography Borat in 2006 Borat was born and raised in the village of Kuzcek, Kazakh SSR to Asimbala Sagdiyev and Boltok the Rapist (who is also stated to be his grandfather, uncle and former father-in-law until the demise of Oksana); he says his mother gave birth to him when she was nine years old. She is shown as a short old lady (revealed to be forty-three years old) in his 2006 mockumentary film, where he gives the viewer a guided tour of his hometown. He has a thirteen-year-old son named Hooeylewis, twelve-year-old twin boys named Bilak and Biram, and seventeen grandchildren. He has a sister, Natalya, whom at different times he has described as the \\"number four prostitute in all of Kazakhstan\\"; another sister who appears to be a very young teenage girl is shown at the beginning of Borat's Guide to Britain. It has been revealed in an interview with a general practitioner that he caught syphilis from one of his sisters during a Kazakh folk festival. He also has a younger brother, Bilo, who is intellectually disabled and kept locked in a cage. Bilo was not always disabled and was shown as an average early teenage boy in Borat's Guide to Britain, at some point Bilo suffered brain damage during an exorcism, when another brother of Borat's tried to release a demon from Bilo through the traditional Kazakh folk remedy of opening the skull and sticking the tooth of a red-haired woman in the brain. Borat's neighbours are Nursultan Tulyakbay (whom Borat considers \\"a pain in my assholes\\") and Dr. Yamak, a scientist who works for the Kazakh government and claims to have proven that women have \\"brain the size of squirrel\\". In Borat's Guide to Britain Borat and Yamak settle a dispute in the traditional Kazakh \\"civilised way\\" by beating each other's genitals with a leather glove until one gives in. It is unknown how many times Borat has been married; he has had at least five wives, in Borat's Guide to Britain he admits to being a bigamist and has three additional lovers (two of whom he describes as his \\"mistress\\" and his \\"girlfriend\\" respectively, and the third he \\"has to pay money for\\"). One of his wives (Ludmilla) is said to have been shot by a hunter when he mistook her for a bear as she ploughed the fields. His former wife, Oksana (who was also his half-sister as they had the same biological father), is reported in the Borat film to have been attacked, \\"violated\\", and \\"broken\\" by a bear while taking his brother Bilo for a walk in the forest. Borat is not saddened by the tragedy; he thanks the man who brings him this \\"good news\\" by giving him a high five and celebrates his new-found freedom by pursuing Baywatch star Pamela Anderson and eventually reunites with and marries Luenell, an African- American prostitute he met whilst filming his documentary. According to various in-character interviews with Sacha Baron Cohen, Borat attended Astana University, where he studied English, journalism and plague research. He created five new plagues which \\"killed over five million goats in Uzbekistan.\\" Prior to his plague research, Borat worked as an ice maker, gypsy catcher, animal puller (one who produces semen from animals) and computer maintenance engineer (specifically, removing dead birds which had nested in the vents in the computer's casing). He now works as a journalist and announcer on Kazakh television. This job \\"helps Borat and other Kazakhs express themselves in ways they otherwise would not have been able to do.\\"Borat film in London, 2006 Borat usually speaks English during his reports; his alleged Kazakh language (or possibly intended to be Russian) during some scenes is in fact a mix of Hebrew and Polish. He usually introduces himself with the term \\"Jagshemash\\" (\\"Jak siƒô masz?\\", meaning \\"How are you?\\" in Polish) and ends reports with \\"Chenqui\\" (\\"Dziƒôkujƒô\\", meaning \\"Thank you\\" in Polish). He often uses the phrase \\"Wa wa wee wa\\", an expression for wow, derived from a skit by Dov Glickman on the popular comedy Zehu Ze! show and is often heard in Israel. Although nominally pagan most of his life in a primarily Muslim (albeit secular) country, sometimes remarking that he \\"follow[s] the hawk\\", during his trip to America he attends a Pentecostal church service and later converts his entire village to Christianity, Borat's version of which involves crucifying Jews. Borat is a keen admirer of Joseph Stalin, and claims that both he and Stalin are strong men with powerful \\"chrum\\" (genitals). He is strongly opposed to women's rights and was quite aghast upon learning that in Britain and America women can vote while horses cannot. He frequently comments that allowing women to vote is like allowing \\"a monkey to drive a car\\". In his spare time, he enjoys playing ping pong, sunbathing while clad in a lime green \\"mankini\\", disco dancing, spitting, sitting on comfortable chairs, shooting dogs, and taking pictures of women while they \\"make a toilet\\". He also enjoys hunting Jews in his homeland. He is fond of \\"sexy time\\", particularly \\"mouth- party\\" and \\"hand-party\\". Borat also states that he \\"very much like Korki Butchek\\" (a fictional Kazakh musician). However, he has a great respect for Muslims, even criticizing U.S. president Donald Trump on his immigration policies regarding majority Muslim countries.https://www.facebook.com/jimmykimmel/videos/borat-premieres-the-new- trailer-for-the-brothers-grimsby/1663583550585407/ Ali G In each episode of Da Ali G Show, Borat is shown doing satirical interviews with often unwitting subjects in the United Kingdom and the United States. The segments were shot in low-quality video to maintain the impression of low quality television broadcasts in a poor country (similar to the Chanel 9 segments on The Fast Show). In Ali G Indahouse, the British PM and Ali G greet Borat who proceeds to hug and then kiss Ali G, who pushes him away. The Borat segments on Da Ali G Show use a rock rendition of a Russian folk tune, \\"Korobeiniki\\", as the theme song. =Guide to Britain= This was created as part of a six- part series of Da Ali G Show that was originally broadcast on Channel 4 (UK) starting in March 2000. Five Borat sketches were shown, in the form of \\"Guides\\" to \\"Etiquette\\", Hunting, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Henley. The \\"Guides\\" to \\"English Gentlemen\\", \\"Politics\\" and \\"Sport\\" were also filmed at this time but released at a later date as part of Ali G DVDs. The Cambridge sketch is the only major Borat material from this series not to have made it onto the compilation DVDs. =Guide to USA 1= Shown as part of a six-part Ali G Show originally on HBO (US) in February 2003. This series was screened and released in the UK as Ali G in the USAiii. Six Borat sketches were shown in the form of \\"Guides\\" to \\"Dating\\", \\"Etiquette\\", \\"Acting\\", \\"Men\\", \\"Baseballs\\" and \\"The (Deep) South\\". A \\"Guide to Animals\\" was filmed but released at a later date as part of an Ali G DVD. (Alyssa Greenfill was his co-star.) =Guide to USA 2= Shown as part of a six-part Ali G Show originally on HBO (US) in July 2004. (Channel 4 was the UK channel where Ali G and Borat originally appeared, and the series for America was a joint HBO/Channel 4 co- production). This series was re-edited for the UK to remove all the Ali G material, becoming two prime-time Borat's Television Programme specials for Channel 4. These specials also embodied the Br√ºno segments from the series and Borat's \\"Guide To Hunting\\", not screened in the US version. The uncut second series as it appeared on HBO was later given a UK courtesy transmission on digital channel E4. Six Borat sketches were shown in the form of \\"Guides\\" to \\"Wine Tasting\\", \\"Politics\\", \\"Country Music\\", \\"Hobbies\\", \\"Buying a House\\" and \\"Jobs\\" (careers), with \\"Hunting\\" airing in the UK only. Films =Ali G Indahouse= Borat had a small cameo role in Baron Cohen's film Ali G Indahouse as a Kazakhstani diplomat, in which he greets Baron Cohen's other character Ali G with a hug and kiss, but is rebuffed and accused of being a homosexual \\"batty boy\\", thus calls Ali G a \\"cocksucker\\". =Borat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan= Borat at the San Diego Comic-Con International in 2006. Subtitled Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, the film Borat is mockumentary comedy. Most of those appearing in the film are not paid performers, but real people whom Borat met on his journey. The film was distributed by 20th Century Fox, and directed by Larry Charles. It premiered at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival, and was released across Europe on 2 November 2006 and North America on 3 November 2006. The film follows Borat in his travels across the United States, as he commits cultural solecisms and exposes a few American ones. Over the course of the film, Borat falls in love with Pamela Anderson after watching a rerun of Baywatch, and vows to make her his wife. The film opened at No. 1 in the U.S., taking in $26.4 million on a limited release of 837 screens during its first weekend, beating Fahrenheit 9/11 as the biggest opening weekend for a film released in fewer than 1,000 cinemas. Baron Cohen celebrated the release of the film with a host of promotional in-character interviews. The film expanded its release on the second weekend to 2,566 screens, where it took in an additional $29 million. In 2007, Baron Cohen won a Golden Globe for \\"Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture ‚Äì Musical Or Comedy\\". With a production budget of $18,000,000 the film has grossed $128,501,044 in the United States of America and another $128,848,505 internationally, for a worldwide gross of $257,349,549 by mid-March 2007. =Borat Subsequent Moviefilm= In 2020, Baron Cohen filmed several pranks for a sequel film. Book In 2007, Baron Cohen released a book titled Touristic Guidings to Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan/Touristic Guidings to Minor Nation of U.S. and A., with humour about both countries in a similar vein to the movie. Character fate Sacha Baron Cohen has stated that the character of Borat, alongside his Ali G character, would be retired.Yahoo Movies: Sacha Baron Cohen to shed Borat persona for good Yahoo, 21 December 2007 Borat's last appearances were at Night of Too Many Stars: An Overbooked Event for Autism Education 2006 television special and an online public service announcement ahead of the 2008 United States elections. However, to promote the trailer release of his then latest film Grimsby, Baron Cohen appeared in character as Borat on Jimmy Kimmel Live! He also made an appearance on the show on 7 November 2018 as a part of a guest appearance by Cohen to promote his show Who Is America? However, he has since completed filming of Borat Subsequent Movie Film, slated for a release on October 23, 2020.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13143964/ Criticism and controversy =Criticized as unfair smear against Kazakhstan= There have been arguments that the film's portrayal of the people of Kazakhstan is unfair and unjustified. In August 2004, the Chief Rabbi of Kazakhstan, addressing an international religious conference in Brussels, stated that in 10 years in the country, he had never faced anti- Semitism. He praised the Government of Kazakhstan for its treatment of the Jewish community. On 19 October 2006, the BBC reported that Kazakhstan's Deputy Foreign Minister, Rakhat Aliyev, had invited Baron Cohen to visit Kazakhstan to see how inaccurate his portrayals were. In an interview, Aliyev asserted that \\"His trip could yield a lot of discoveries‚Äîthat women not only travel inside buses but also drive their own cars, that we make wine from grapes, that Jews can freely attend synagogues and so on. =Denigration of Roma= Borat's movie has been accused of promoting antiziganism. The film has been criticised for several scenes portraying Borat's fictional Kazakhstani village which were actually filmed in the impoverished Roma village of Glod in Romania. USA Today reports that poverty-stricken villagers were offered between $3.30 and $5.50 to bring animals into their houses and other gag scenes for the movie that some people described as humiliating. The studio contends that participants were paid double the rate recommended by the Romanian film office for extras. Additionally, Baron Cohen personally donated $5,000 to the village, as well as computers and school supplies. Two villagers of Glod hired controversialFuchs, Mary (24 June 2009). \\"Lawyer Edward Fagan is disbarred in N.J. for misusing Holocaust victims' funds\\". New Jersey Real-Time News.

Fagan planned to refile, but has since been disbarred. =Denigration of Jews= The Borat character has been accused of anti- Semitism but Baron Cohen, himself a Jew, has explained that the segments are a \\"dramatic demonstration of how racism feeds on dumb conformity, as much as rabid bigotry.\\" \\"Borat essentially works as a tool. By himself pretending to be anti-Semitic, he lets people lower their guard and expose their own prejudice,\\" Baron Cohen explained to Rolling Stone. Baron Cohen, the grandson of a Holocaust survivor, says he wishes in particular to expose the role of indifference: (The actual line from Kershaw's 1983 book Popular Opinion and Political Dissent in the Third Reich was that \\"the road to Auschwitz was built by hate, but paved with indifference\\".)Evans, Kershaw Popular Opinion and Political Dissent in the Third Reich: Bavaria 1933‚Äì1945, Oxford University Press, 2002, page 277 Evans, Richard In Hitler's Shadow, New York: Pantheon, 1989 p. 71Marrus, Michael The Holocaust in History, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2000 p. 91. However, the Anti-Defamation League, a United States-based group that \\"...combat[s] anti-Semitism and bigotry of all kinds\\", complained to HBO after Borat performed his country and western song \\"In My Country There Is Problem\\". It called on people to \\"throw the Jew down the well\\", warning that \\"you must be careful of his teeth\\" and that \\"you must grab him by his money\\", and was welcomed with applause and participation by some members of an audience in Tucson, Arizona. The full chorus goes: \\"Throw the Jew down the well / So my country can be free / You must grab him by his horns / Then we have a big party.\\"Letter to Sacha Baron Cohen (\\"Ali G\\") Statement On The Comedy Of Sacha Baron Cohen, A.K.A. \\"Borat\\" Regarding the enthusiastic response to \\"In My Country There Is Problem\\", he says, \\"Did it reveal that they were anti- Semitic? Perhaps. But maybe it just revealed that they were indifferent to anti-Semitism.\\" In another scene, Borat visits the Serengeti Range ranch in Texas, where the owner of the ranch confides that he believes the Holocaust was a necessity for Germany. He further implies that he would have no moral qualms about running a ranch where people can hunt, in Borat's words, \\"deer... then Jew.\\" An interview with James Broadwater, an evangelical Christian and Republican candidate for the United States' Congress from Mississippi, caused Broadwater to receive some hate emails after an episode of Da Ali G Show aired in which Broadwater stated that all non-Christians (including Jews) will go to Hell. He was told that the interview would be played in foreign countries to teach others about the American political system. Broadwater later posted a letter on his website denouncing Da Ali G Show, explaining that his statement referred to a theological belief that anyone that \\"accepts Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour will spend eternity in Heaven, while everyone who rejects Him will spend eternity in Hell.\\" Broadwater did not apologise for his comments. Instead, he insisted that \\"the liberal, anti-God media needs to be brought under the strict control of the FCC, and that as soon as possible.\\" In the film, Borat continues his anti-Semitic stance. When he mentions his decision to avoid flying while in America, Borat says that his colleague \\"insists we not fly in case the Jews repeat their attack of 9/11\\". Later, he finds himself in a bed & breakfast run by a kind elderly Jewish couple. He tries to \\"escape\\", and throws money at two woodlice that have crawled into his room, apparently believing that the Jewish hosts have shapeshifted into the tiny woodlice. He was amazed that they had managed to look human, and states that one \\"can hardly see their horns\\". Borat is completely oblivious to his hosts' religious beliefs or ethnicity when he first meets them, despite how obvious it is: the man wears a kippah and the woman openly displays her paintings of Jewish people all over the house. Borat does not understand until the woman explicitly states to him: \\"I'm Jewish.\\" The film has enjoyed particular success in Israel because Israeli filmgoers understand what Borat is really saying when he is supposedly spouting Kazakh: throughout the film, Borat speaks fluent Hebrew with some phrases in Polish, and his assistant speaks Armenian. =Views on Iraq War= On 7 January 2005, after convincing the authorities that he was shooting a documentary film, Baron Cohen managed to infuriate a crowd at a rodeo in Salem, Virginia. Even though the crowd first cheered at the beginning of his statements of support for the Iraq War: He then went on to sing an off-key rendition of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" with the lyrics replaced by those of the fictitious \\"Kazakh national anthem\\" \\"O Kazakhstan\\" used at the end of the film (composed by Erran Baron Cohen), beginning with \\"Kazakhstan, greatest country in the world / All other countries are run by little girls...\\" \\"If he had been out there a minute longer, I think somebody would have shot him,\\" said one witness. \\"People were booing him, flipping him off.\\" For his own safety, Baron Cohen was escorted from the venue (much of the event appears in the movie).\\"Rodeo in Salem gets unexpected song rendition\\", The Roanoke Times, 9 January 2005. A credulous news report about the incident, aired on a local television station, is included in the DVD extras.

Carr began singing in church, and performed in gospel groups including the Harmony Echoes, at the same time as making tables on an assembly line in Memphis. After being turned down by Stax, he made his first recordings for Goldwax Records, a small Memphis-based independent record label, in 1964. He released several singles for the label before achieving his first success in 1966, when \\"You've Got My Mind Messed Up\\" reached number 7 on the Billboard R&B; chart and number 63 on the pop chart.Biography by Steve Huey, Allmusic.com. Retrieved October 15, 2016 He also released the successful and critically acclaimed album You Got My Mind Messed Up.\\"You Got My Mind Messed Up\\", Allmusic.com. Retrieved October 15, 2016 Carr continued to have chart entries with his later singles on Goldwax, including \\"Pouring Water on a Drowning Man\\", but his greatest success and most critically acclaimed performance came in 1967 with his original recording of \\"The Dark End of the Street\\", written by Dan Penn and Chips Moman. The song reached number 10 on the R&B; chart and number 77 on the pop chart. Carr continued to record for Goldwax until the label closed in 1969 but failed to reach the same heights with his subsequent releases, though \\"A Man Needs a Woman\\" in 1968 reached number 16 on the R&B; chart and number 63 on the pop chart, and he recorded an album of the same title. After Goldwax closed down in 1969, he released a single on Atlantic Records in 1971, and another on his manager Roosevelt Jamison's River City label in 1977. Carr suffered from bipolar disorder for most of his life. This frequently found him unable to deal with the stress of performing and touring, which became most evident during a tour of Japan in 1979 when he froze in front of an audience following an overdose of antidepressants. Despite this he was dubbed \\"the world's greatest Soul Singer\\". However, he completed the Japan tour before returning to Memphis. Thereafter he lived with his sister but was frequently hospitalized. A resurgence in interest in his music, spurred by his portrayal in Peter Guralnick's 1986 book Sweet Soul Music, helped return Carr to the recording studio, and he was able to complete another album, Take Me to the Limit, for a revived Goldwax label in 1991. He also performed at festivals in the US and Europe, and released another album, Soul Survivor, in 1994. He was diagnosed with lung cancer in the mid-1990s, and died in a Memphis nursing home in 2001, aged 58.

It was named after William Crooks, the Chief Mechanical Engineer for the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. He served as a colonel and commander of the 6th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War.Wills, Jocelyn. Boosters, Hustlers and Speculators: Entrepreneurial Culture and the Rise of Minneapolis and St. Paul 1849-1883. Minnesota Historical Society, St. Paul, MN p. 105. 2005 Crooks laid the initial track between Minneapolis and St. Paul and the \\"William Crooks\\" was the first locomotive to run on the line.  History  = 1861 - 1900 = Constructed in 1861 for the Minnesota and Pacific Railroad as their number 1,Keyes & Middleton (1980). p.40 The William Crooks first provided service a year later in 1862 for the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (into which the M&P; had been reorganized by that time). After completion, the locomotive traveled by rail to La Crosse, Wisconsin, which was the nearest rail point to St. Paul at the time. From there, it was loaded onto a Mississippi River barge bound for St. Paul. Though it arrived in St. Paul on September 9, 1861, it was not until June 28, 1862, that the passenger equipment arrived and of track could be laid. The William Crooks carried its first train load of passengers on the same day. The trip began at 2:30 PM from St. Paul with the train and its passengers returning from their trip to St. Anthony (now Minneapolis) at 6 PM.(PDF) While the governor of Minnesota, the founder of the railroad, and other dignitaries were the train's first passengers, the train moved into regular service four days later. The locomotive was originally a wood-burner with a tender that held just two cords of wood. Often the tender's wood was used before the train could reach a wood pile, forcing the crew to make use of the wooden right-of-way fences to keep the train moving. Later the locomotive was converted into a coal-burner. As built, the engine had a straight boiler (not tapered from a larger diameter at the firebox end to a smaller diameter at the smokebox end), had the balloon stack typical of wood burning engines, and three domes‚Äîthe center of which was for sanding the rails to improve traction when needed. As the engine aged and parts replaced, the engine's appearance changed. The engine received a diamond stack for burning coal, its boiler replaced with a tapered design, and was reduced to a two dome configuration. In 1868 a fire partially destroyed the William Crooks. Albion B. Smith was tasked with restoring the locomotive and became the locomotive's engineer once it returned to service. He became a personal friend to James J. Hill through his works and service with the William Crooks. The old locomotive had served almost 50 years and had eventually been assigned to runs in Montana and Washington. The William Crooks was in passenger service until September 30, 1897, after which it was retired, and by the turn of the century was sitting decommissioned in a corner of the Great Northern yard in St. Paul. The locomotive was restored to operation for Hill's 70th birthday in 1908, as he had insisted when informed of its condition. Smith, who worked a regular schedule for the Great Northern Railway, would be reassigned to duty with the William Crooks for special events such as this and, later, the Alaska‚ÄìYukon‚ÄìPacific Exposition. After he received word that the William Crooks was to be scrapped, it was Smith who spoke to Hill about it, with Hill declaring, \\"Not as long as I live\\". After Hill's death in 1916, the Great Northern continued to exhibit the train at special events. The railroad gave the engine a balloon stack similar in appearance to its original, but internally designed to be suitable for coal as well as wood. = 1900 - Present = In 1924 the locomotive went on an exhibition tour from Chicago to Seattle. For this event, the railroad rebuilt the engine to further resemble its original form, restoring it to the original three-dome configuration, though it retained the tapered boiler. The William Crooks was displayed at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's \\"Fair of the Iron Horse\\" in 1927, then at the 1939 New York World's Fair, and finally at the Chicago Railroad Fair in 1948 as part of the \\"Wheels A-Rolling\\" pageant, traveling to and from all three events under its own power. Though the locomotive had been converted from burning wood to burning coal as fuel, its headlight remained lit by kerosene; this restricted the William Crooks' travel to daylight hours only. On the way to the 1939 World's Fair, the locomotive made a stop in Paterson, New Jersey, where it had been built 78 years before. The old locomotive made many stops en route to New York City, drawing crowds everywhere it went. At that time it was the oldest locomotive operating under its own power. Accompanying the William Crooks was John J. Maher, a retired Great Northern engineer. Maher began his career with the railroad in 1881 as a fireman for the William Crooks; he became the locomotive's engineer in 1888. He indicated that there had been no breakdowns during the trip from St. Paul and speculated that the locomotive could probably travel at up to without difficulty. Maher, whose work as a fireman took place before the William Crooks was converted to burning coal, recalled that in the early days, part of a fireman's equipment was an axe, so wood could be chopped if the wood in the locomotive's tender ran out. He said he often needed to go out and look for wood to keep the William Crooks moving. The locomotive was accompanied to the World's Fair by two 1880s vintage coaches which still had their original candle holders from the days when they were lit by candle light, and their original wood stoves for warmth. Its cylinders, rods and bearings were all rebuilt at the Great Northern's Dale Street Shops in St. Paul in 1947-48 by machinist George A. Halvorsen as his last job before retirement. The William Crooks was placed on display at the St. Paul Union Depot in June 1954. In June 1962 the Great Northern transferred ownership of the engine to the Minnesota Historical Society, though the engine remained displayed in the depot. The St. Paul Union Depot closed to passenger traffic in 1971; however, the engine was not removed until 1975, when it was moved to the newly established Lake Superior Railroad Museum in Duluth, Minnesota, where it remains.  Legacy  The William Crooks is one of only a few locomotives from the time of the Civil War that survive today. For the celebration of the 150th anniversary of rail service in Minnesota, the locomotive's whistle was blown for the first time since 1948, when it appeared at the Chicago Railroad Fair. In 1959-1960 Marx Toy Company retailed, through Montgomery Ward, an electric toy train using the William Crooks locomotive design and freight express cars for their Tales of Wells Fargo play-set. In 1973 the train was reissued, as a Heritage play-set, The Pioneer Express, retailed through Sears & Roebuck, with the locomotive pulling the tender, an open lumber car and caboose. https://dfarq.homeip.net/marx-william-crooks-locomotive/  Images  File:William Crooks photo.JPGWilliam Crooks near Elk River, Minnesota in 1864 File:Locomotive William Crooks at St. Paul Union Depot 1954.jpgWilliam Crooks being placed on display at the Saint Paul Union Depot File:Pullman sleeping car circa 1860s.JPGThis Pullman sleeping car, original to the train, was part of the 1924 exhibition tour File:William Crooks at St. Paul Union Depot 1962.JPGThe William Crooks on display in the Saint Paul Union Depot in 1962 File:Minnesota Historical Society dismantling William Crooks.jpgWilliam Crooks being dismantled in preparation for its move to the Lake Superior Railroad Museum in 1975 File:William Crooks at station.jpgPublicity photo of the William Crooks at Union Station, Washington, D.C. on 20 September 1927 while en route to the Fair of the Iron Horse.

Aker Kv√¶rner (OSE: AKVER) was founded in 2004 from the major restructuring of a complex \\"Aker Kv√¶rner\\" business unit, formed originally in 2002 by the merger of Aker Maritime and Kv√¶rner Oil & Gas. On 3 April 2008, Aker Kv√¶rner was renamed Aker Solutions, partly due to the difficulty that most non-Scandinavians found in pronouncing \\"Kv√¶rner\\". In 2007, the company was identified by Amnesty International as an accessory to torture and other human rights abuses for its collaboration in constructing and maintaining the US detention camp at Guantanamo Bay. Aker Kv√¶rner first broke ground at the site in 1993 and continued contract work with the US Department of Defense until 2006. The company was majority controlled by Aker ASA until 2007. Then, via a major ownership restructuring on 22 June 2007, Aker ASA completely gave up its holding in Aker Solutions, and transferred a 40% stake to Aker Holding, which in turn was owned by Aker ASA (60%), the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry (30%), SAAB (7.5%) and Investor AB (2.5%). History Aker Solutions is a result of mergers between several Norwegian companies during the 20th century. =Evolution of Aker Kvaerner: 1841 to 2002= The timeline below summarizes the main events leading to the foundation of Aker Kvaerner‚Äîfrom its origins as Aker Mechanical Workshop (1841)‚Äîuntil the merger of Aker Maritime with Kv√¶rner Oil & Gas to form Aker Kvaerner (2002). *Timeline **1841: Aker established its first mechanical workshop along the Aker river in Oslo called Aker Mechanical Workshop **1853: Kv√¶rner Brug was founded in Oslo. **1922: Kv√¶rner Brug began cooperation with Myrens Verksted **1943: Kv√¶rner and Myren jointly acquired the majority shareholding in Thunes Mekaniske Verksted. **1960: Kv√¶rner Brug's President, Kjell Langballe, was appointed President of all companies within the 'Kv√¶rner Group' **1967: Joint holding company Kv√¶rner Industries AS was established in December that year, and listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The Kv√¶rner Group comprised 10 Norwegian companies with 3,200 employees and operating revenues of NOK 385 million. It entered the offshore oil and gas market from its base in Oslo through Kv√¶rner Engineering, which was established as an engineering and contracting company in the late 1960s. **1978: Offshore construction work started at Kv√¶rner Egersund and during this period the shipyard in Stavanger was converted into an offshore fabrication facility. **1993: Construction work began at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp through its jointly owned subsidiary, Kv√¶rner Process Services Inc. (KPSI), initiating a business partnership with the US Department of Defense that would last until 2006. **1996: Kv√¶rner sought to strengthen its engineering base internationally through the acquisition of the UK-based conglomerate, Trafalgar House and became an international player in shipbuilding, oil and gas, pulp and paper and engineering and construction. It moved its international headquarters to London. **1998: Kv√¶rner's pulp and paper became a core business area in its own right **1999: The company initiated a major sell-off, focusing on realising capital through divestments. These efforts did not solve the mounting financial and operational challenges, which eventually brought the company into an acute liquidity crisis in August 2001. **2000: In July of that year, Aker Maritime ASA, a Norway-based offshore products, technology and services provider, bought a 26 per cent of the shares in Kv√¶rner ASA. **2001: In November of that year, an agreement was reached between Aker Maritime ASA and Kv√¶rner ASA. Aker Maritime injected NOK 2.8 bn in net assets, raised another NOK 3.5 bn through two direct issues and renegotiated NOK 8.6 bn of Kv√¶rner's debt. ** 2002: The Group decided to adopt the Aker Kvaerner brand for the entire Group. =Aker Kv√¶rner, and transition to Aker Solutions: 2002 to 2008= Logo of Aker Kv√¶rner prior to company renaming. Aker Kv√¶rner was the result of a merger of Aker Maritime and Kv√¶rner Oil & Gas in 2002, and a major restructuring of the Aker Kv√¶rner business unit in 2004. Earlier in 2003, the group structure of Aker Kv√¶rner was split into six business areas; Field Development Europe, MMO Europe, Subsea & Oilfield Products, Oil, Gas & Process International, E&C; Europe and E&C; Americas. A need arose in 2004 to simplify a rather complex group structure which led to the formation of two focused industrial groups: Aker Kv√¶rner, specialists within Oil, Gas, Energy and Process; and Aker Yards, specialist shipbuilders. In addition, Aker Kv√¶rner became a minor shareholder in the Finnish engineering company Aker Arctic in 2004. The new Aker Kvaerner started trading on Oslo Stock Exchange under ticker symbol 'AKVER' on 2 April 2004. In 2006, the company's paper/pulp and power businesses were sold to Finnish-based Metso in a deal worth ‚Ç¨335 million. On 7 June 2007, an agreement was announced where a 40.1% stake of the company would be sold from Aker ASA to Aker Holding. The new company would be owned by Aker ASA (60%), the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry (30%), SAAB (7.5%) and Investor (2.5%). In 2007, the company was identified by Amnesty International as an accessory to torture and other human rights abuses for its collaboration in constructing and maintaining the US detention camp at Guantanamo Bay. =Aker Solutions: 2008 to present= During the AGM held on 3 April 2008, Aker Kv√¶rner announced that it was rebranding as Aker Solutions, referencing the connection with Aker's businesses heritage, but also recognizing that non-Scandinavians find the name Kv√¶rner difficult to pronounce. The new company trades under the symbol 'AKSO' on the Oslo stock exchange. Between April 2010 and June 2010, the company was awarded three contracts by Noble Energy to supply steel tube umbilicals, a complete mono- ethylene glycol (MEG) reclamation unit, and subsea control equipment for the construction of offshore oil platforms in the Tamar gas field in Israel. Together, the contracts were worth NOK 1.1 billion. However, on 6 May 2011, the Kv√¶rner name re-emerged when Aker Solutions' EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) division was rebadged, with the resulting new company being spun off and listed on Oslo Stock Exchange in 2011/Q3. Aker Solutions' holding company ‚Äì Aker Holdings AS ‚Äì was also renamed to Aker Kv√¶rner Holding AS owning around 40% of Kv√¶rner ASA. Aker ASA took over the 10% stake owned by Saab and Investor AB, raising its stake in Aker Kv√¶rner Holding AS to 70%. In 2014, Aker Solutions was further divided to two companies, Aker Solutions and Akastor, then in August Aker Solutions leased the entire first phase of the new Aberdeen International Business Park as part of a consolidation and strengthening of its oilfield services in and around Aberdeen, Scotland. However, on 18 February 2015, the company announced the loss of around 300 jobs in Norway as a response to falling oil prices and the decline in demand for drilling services.

It was developed in the mid 1990s by the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory partly in response to growing problem on inner-city fighting, and especially made urgent following the Battle of Mogadishu in 1993. Press materials from the Warfighting Lab in 1997 stated, \\"..the world is becoming increasingly urbanized and increasingly dangerous\\" and described a new fight zone called the \\"urban littoral,\\" or coastal zone where most of the world's population will reside. \\"Parts of the urban littoral will contain all the classic ingredients for conflict. There will be social, cultural, religious and tribal strife between different groups. Many areas will have scarce resources, including the most basic ones like food and shelter as populations grow and resources shrink even further. The chances for conflict will naturally grow with it\\".Marine Corps Warfighting Lab press release 17 October 1997 Some preferred to call it the \\"Three Block War\\".Navy Times - MC edition, 27 October 1997 The concern that Marines would be made responsible for humanitarian assistance, as evidenced by the Bosnian War, was part of the original planning of the program. According to a 1997 Defense Monitor brief, the Marines were facing the burden of excessive operational tempo related to humanitarian concerns. The importance of getting the military out of humanitarian relief was expressed in the 1997 Center for Defense Information brief.DC -I.S.S.N. #0195 - 6450 Background The program has been called one of the most important in the United States Armed Forces. This is because, even though the U.S. is believed to have one of the most powerful conventional military forces in the world, many of the more powerful weapons systems intended for use fighting in open places are useless in urban settings. This was the case in some forested regions of Europe, and in open deserts encountered during the Gulf War and Iraq War. Lines of approach through cities tend to be long and narrow, with sharp turns, civilians, street traffic and local commerce. This environment is one where heavy fighting vehicles like the M1 Abrams can not maneuver well, avoid being seen from a long distance by potential hostiles, nor be certain that all ground surfaces will support vehicle weight. Inhabitants may have any of a huge number of possible reactions, including anger, resentment, disrespect, and a strong potential for spontaneous protest, disorder, and uninitiated response. Those who are friendly may be desperate for assistance but afraid, increasing the risk of stampedes and other problems. Those who are hostile will be on their home ground, have familiarity with the terrain, and decide to defend their home turf. Furthermore, those who use unconventional warfare will have found protection among inhabitants. To use options like airstrikes, artillery, and mortars against cities will have a high cost in missed targets and civilian casualties. History records many military operations involving cities, of which a large number degenerated into torturous situations with massive casualties. Stalingrad and Saigon are two modern examples. As the world's population becomes concentrated in cities, current and future fighting will likely to take place within them. This means that there will be an increase in the demand for infantrymen, on account of the fact that infantrymen are uniquely able to enter built-up areas, uproot and clear them, defend them, and even search the local residence. This is one reason why United States military leaders plans include the reasonable assumption that the infantryman's role in combat operations will increase rather than decrease in the coming years, such as the Land Warrior system. Urban Warrior is seen as having one primary purpose: to fight enemies in urban environments; with a secondary purpose is to conduct and refine disaster relief and humanitarian assistance for use in the United States and abroad. Doing so supposedly involves gaining the support and trust of the local population by engaging in humanitarian efforts, a project the Marine Corps has more recently sought to distance itself from. Some lessons learned from Urban Warrior were applied in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and subsequent occupation. Fighting in Najaf and Fallujah has once again made it clear that local irregular forces tend to have the advantage of home territory and plentiful local support. Religion, ideology, and culture may also play in the local insurgent's favor. Non-combatants often side with them because of nationalism, ethnic connections, general dislike or even hatred, of a foreign invading force. For example, this tendency became clear in Mogadishu, Somalia, when civilians chose to support the Habar Gidir (as opposed to United Nations and U.S. forces), and in Fallujah, where most of the remaining civilians decided the invasion forces were less favorable than the insurgent defenders. Experimental T-pattern BDU jacket Label of the experimental T-pattern BDU jacket for urban environment An experimental urban camouflage Battle Dress Uniform was developed and used during the Urban Warrior exercises of 1999. The pattern, sometimes called T-pattern or T-block, consists of three gray tones arranged in a geometric pattern, intended as a 'pattern breaker' to make Marine troops harder to locate when in such environments. Like all modern BDUs, it is made of a lightweight rip-stop material. The pattern was never officially adopted, and it has since been superseded by MARPAT. History =Exercises in Chicago, May 1998= Eighty Marines from 1st Battalion, 8th Marines, stationed in Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, toured Chicago to enhance knowledge of urban infrastructure, such as a gas plant, water facility, tunnels, bridges, and police and Fire stations. =Exercises in the San Francisco East Bay, March 1999= A four-day military exercise was planned and executed in Oakland, California in March 1999. A combined force of 6,000 Marines and 700 sailors took control of the grounds and buildings of the defunct Oak Knoll Naval Hospital invaded the defunct Naval Air Station Alameda on the second day as part of a national effort called Operation Sea Dragon. After original plans to use the San Francisco Presidio were rejected by the National Park Service based on the size of the spectacle and its inherent environmental damage, and a trial run at the Naval Postgraduate School beach in Monterey, California, Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown and Alameda Mayor Ralph Appezzato welcomed the Marines to use their cities as a proving ground. The operations included numerous aviation assets, such as AV-8B Harrier IIs, CH-46 Sea Knights, CH-53 Sea Stallions, AH-1 SuperCobras, and UH-1N Twin Hueys, as well as several Landing Craft Air Cushion. Five Navy ships, including and ,were brought in and opened for public view during the operations.

Directed by Randal Kleiser and released by Walt Disney Pictures, it stars Rick Moranis, Marcia Strassman, Amy O'Neill, and Robert Oliveri, who reprise their roles as Wayne, Diane, Amy, and Nick Szalinski respectively, as well as newcomer Keri Russell in her film debut as Mandy Park, Nick's love interest and babysitter of Adam, their new son, whose accidental exposure to Wayne's new industrial-sized growth machine causes him to gradually grow to enormous size. It is set three years after the events depicted in the first film. It was filmed in 1991. The antagonist to the Szalinskis is Wayne's coworker, Dr. Charles Hendrickson (John Shea), who wants the giant Adam stopped at all costs and would like to take over Wayne's invention that is now owned by the major corporation they work for, which is in turn owned by the kind Clifford Sterling (Lloyd Bridges). The franchise continued with: a sequel, a television series, and theme-park attractions. Plot Three years after inventor Wayne Szalinski accidentally shrunk his and his next door neighbor's kids, his family have moved to Nevada and have welcomed a new son, mischievous two-year old Adam. One day, Wayne's wife, Diane, leaves with their daughter, Amy, to help her settle in her dorm at college, leaving Wayne to look after Adam and their teenage son, Nick, who struggles with puberty. He has developed a crush on Mandy Park, who Wayne later arranges to babysit Adam. The next day, Wayne takes Nick and Adam to Sterling Labs, where he has constructed an advanced derivative of his shrink ray which could make objects grow. He tests it out on Adam's favorite toy, Big Bunny. However, when his and Nick's backs are turned, Adam attempts to retrieve it and is zapped by the machine, which appears to short circuit and not enlarge the targeted object. Back home, Adam and Big Bunny are exposed to electrical waves from the microwave oven and grow in size, now seven feet tall. Wayne and Nick try to take him back to the lab to reverse the process, but are caught and kicked out by Wayne's coworker, Dr. Charles Hendrickson, who dislikes him and wants to take over Wayne's invention for himself. Diane returns home early and discovers what happened, and she, Wayne, and Nick have a hard time trying to take care of the large Adam. Later, Wayne and Diane drive to a warehouse and retrieve Wayne's first prototype to turn Adam back to normal, with Wayne unintentionally test firing his original prototype on a pair of Nevada Highway Patrol motorcycle troopers pursuing his van for speeding to make sure it still worked before Diane orders him to return them to normal, leaving the troopers completely spooked by the experience. When Mandy arrives to babysit Adam, she panics and faints, forcing Nick to tie her to a chair and gags her so she cannot run away or scream. As he explains the situation to her, Adam is exposed to the television's electrical waves and grows to fourteen feet before escaping through a wall. Nick and Mandy search for him, but are taken into custody, with Adam placed into a truck. Wayne and Diane return home, finding the smug Dr. Hendrickson waiting for them. He has summoned Clifford Sterling, the company chairman, with the plan to fire Wayne, have him and Diane arrested, and experiment on Adam. Sterling arrives, praises Wayne when he admits his mistake, and pledges to help Adam while firing Dr. Hendrickson, much to Wayne's and Diane's amazement. At the same time, the truck carrying Adam passes by high voltage lines, exposing him to more electrical waves and causing him to grow even larger, escaping confinement. He mistakes Nick and Mandy for toys and puts them in his overalls pocket before heading for Las Vegas, pursued by his parents and the authorities. Wayne and Clifford figure out the cause of his growth and realize that exposure to Las Vegas' neon lights will make him grow bigger than ever. The infuriated Dr. Hendrickson refuses to accept his dismissal and turns to board director Terrence Wheeler and they plan to start a boardroom coup to take Sterling out of power. With his permission, Dr. Hendrickson forcefully boards a military helicopter to attempt to tranquilize Adam, despite the pilot's reluctance. Wayne is determined to use his shrinking machine to shrink Adam back to normal, but needs him to stand still for twelve seconds so he can be shrunk. At first, he tries using Big Bunny to pacify him, but it backfires when Wayne suggests for Adam to take a nap (which the baby hates). After growing to 112 feet and wandering through Las Vegas, causing a panic among the crowd, he pursues an ice cream truck driven by Marshall Preston Brooks to distract him away from the city while Sterling has the various hotels and casinos shut off their lights to avoid making Adam grow more. However, Adam then heads towards the Hard Rock Caf√©, where he plays the lit up guitar. Diane realizes Adam just wants to play and doesn't fully acknowledge the damage he's causing, and deduces he will behave should she be enlarged as well. Dr. Hendrickson arrives in the helicopter and starts shooting tranquilizer cartridges at Adam, hitting the guitar instead, causing Adam to cry out in pain of the electric shock. As the panicked crowd begins to feel sorry for Adam and Dr. Hendrickson adamantly attempts to strike again, a giant-sized Diane arrives and stops the helicopter. She then comforts Adam and manages to get him to stand still for the needed time period for the shrinking ray to work. Wayne then fires it, returning them to normal size. Dr. Hendrickson arrives and attempts to justify his actions, but a furious Diane knocks him out cold with a punch to the face. Wayne and Diane then realize that Nick and Mandy had somehow disappeared from Adam's overalls pocket. It is then revealed that the two teens, along with the Lotus Elan M100 that Adam retrieved during his rampage, have been shrunk to the size of insects. They are quickly found by Wayne, who decides to give them a few minutes of privacy before returning them to normal size. The only problem left now pointed out by a state trooper with the Szalinskis is how to shrink the gigantic Big Bunny.

Production The film was not originally written as a sequel to Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. Originally titled Big Baby, it was about a toddler who grew to giant size by a freak accident involving a growth ray and eventually terrorized Las Vegas in a non- violent, yet Godzillaesque way. Disney saw the possibilities of making this into a sequel to the first film and rewrote the script. Whereas most of the characters from Big Baby were rewritten as characters from Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, there was no character in the original that \\"Amy Szalinski\\" could replace, so she is seen going away to college in the beginning of the film. Prior to this, sequel development was offered to screenwriter and teacher David Trottier.http://www.scriptmag.com/reviews/tool-reviews/how-the-writers- store-changed-my-life =Casting= Rick Moranis returns from the first film to portray \\"wacky\\" inventor Wayne Szalinski. Also returning is his wife, Diane, who is portrayed by Marcia Strassman. Amy O'Neill and Robert Oliveri return to portray their kids, Amy and Nick. Nick has matured in his personality and interests since the first film. He is still considered \\"nerdy\\", but has taken more interest in girls and guitars. Casting director Renee Rousselot searched over 1,000 small children for someone to portray Adam, the newest addition to the Szalinski clan. She searched for mostly three- to four-year-old boys because a younger child was thought to be problematic. She came across twins Daniel and Joshua Shalikar from New Jersey and immediately cast them in December 1990. One would act in the morning while the other was eating lunch or taking a nap. Baby consultant Elaine Hall Katz and director Randal Kleiser would plan the twins' scenes a week in advance. Tom Smith reported that, \\"On his own, Dan was almost too adventuresome to repeat one move, and Josh seemed very cautious. Put them together and they could do anything.\\" However, the film did have difficulties in working with such small children, and one crew member later remarked it was \\"like playing hopscotch on hot coals\\". At the time, the twins were scheduled to appear in two more Honey films. They did appear once, but were recast in Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves. In the film, Nick has a crush on a girl named Mandy Park, played by Keri Russell in her first feature film. John Shea portrays Dr. Charles Hendrickson, who is scheming to get Wayne's control of the project, while Lloyd Bridges portrays Clifford Sterling, the owner of Sterling Labs. Fred Rogers and Richard Simmons are also seen in videos in TV scenes in the film. =Production= Randal Kleiser, of Grease and White Fang fame, was chosen to direct the film, replacing Joe Johnston. He would return to film with the cast in the 3D show, Honey, I Shrunk the Audience, which was at several Disney parks until 2010. Like the first film, and Grease, it had animated opening credits. Production began on June 17, 1991. Filming took place in Simi Valley, California for the parts involving the Szalinskis' house. Filming locations in Las Vegas included the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, the Mirage hotel-casino, and Fremont Street. Scenes involving a water park, where Nick worked and where Mandy is first introduced, were filmed at Wet 'n Wild in Las Vegas. Special effects were used heavily throughout the film, but some were not. When Adam knocks down his bedroom door, production designer Leslie Dilley created a set with miniature furniture about four feet away from the camera, while the adult actors would be about fifteen feet away. Kleiser recalled, \\"Danny was generally better at improvising and fresh reactions. Josh was better at following directions, so we would alternate.\\" =Lawsuit before release= Disney would later find itself the subject of a lawsuit as a result of the film. The suit was filed in 1991 by Mark Goodson Productions director Paul Alter, who claimed to have come up with the idea of an oversized toddler after babysitting his granddaughter and watching her topple over building blocks. He wrote a screenplay titled \\"Now, That's a Baby!\\", which had not been made into a film but had received some sort of treatment beforehand.\\"Disney, the Mouse Betrayed\\" by Peter and Rochelle Schweitzer Alter claimed there were several similarities between the film and his script, which consisted of the baby daughter of two scientists falling victim to a genetic experiment gone wrong instead of an enlarging ray. The case went to trial in 1993, with the jury finding in Alter's favor. Disney was forced to pay $300,000 in damages. Release =Home media= The film was first released on VHS and Laserdisc on January 6, 1993. It was released on a bare-bones DVD in 2002. While the VHS release contained no bonus material besides a music video, the Laserdisc release contains the 1992 animated short film, Off His Rockers directed by Barry Cook, which accompanied the theatrical release. To date, Off His Rockers has only appeared on the Laserdisc release, making its availability rare, although the short can be viewed on YouTube. The film was released on VHS in 1997, alongside its predecessor to coincide with the release of the third film in the series, Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves. Reception =Box office= The film opened on July 17, 1992 to 2,492 theaters, almost twice as many as the first film. It opened at number one on opening weekend with $11 million and grossed $58.7 million in the United States. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 40% based on reviews from 20 critics, with an average rating of 4.85/10. On Metacritic the film has a score of 50% based on reviews from 14 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Desson Howe of The Washington Post claimed that the film \\"feels narratively limited. It's a one-joke movie: Adam just gets bigger and bigger. All Moranis needs to do is get the shrinker from the last movie and turn it on Adam.\\" Also from The Washington Post, Hal Hinson agreed that it was \\"a one-joke film\\" while also adding the film \\"squanders most of the comic opportunities its premise offers. As one-joke movies go, it's fairly inoffensive but also never better than mildly diverting. Roger Ebert, reviewing for the Chicago Sun-Times, criticized the weak story writing that there \\"may be, for all I know, comic possibilities in a giant kid, but this movie doesn't find them.\\" He further concluded that the \\"special effects, on the other hand, are terrific, as they were in the first movie. The filmmakers are able to combine the giant baby and the \\"real world\\" in shots that seem convincing, and the image of the toddler walking down Glitter Gulch is state- of-the-art. Too bad the movie relies on special effects to carry the show, and doesn't bring much else to the party.\\" Soundtrack Intrada Records released the record in 1992, in time for the film's release. The score was composed and conducted by Bruce Broughton, who would return to provide the score for Honey, I Shrunk the Audience. \\"Stayin Alive\\" by the Bee Gees appears in it. So does \\"Loco-Motion\\" by Carole King, Gerry Goffin, and \\"Ours If We Want It\\" written by Tom Snow and Mark Mueller. The soundtrack album consists of just the score. In 2017, the label released an expanded edition included Broughton's score for Off His Rockers, the animated short that preceded the film in cinemas. =1992 album= =2017 album= References External links  * Category:1992 films Category:1990s adventure films Category:1990s science fiction comedy films Category:American films Category:American children's comedy films Category:American science fiction comedy films Category:American sequel films Category:English-language films Category:Films about size change Category:Films directed by Randal Kleiser Category:Films set in 1992 Category:Films set in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Films set in Nevada Category:Films shot in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Films shot in Nevada Category:Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (franchise) mass media Category:Fiction about size change Category:Walt Disney Pictures films Category:Fictional portrayals of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Category:Films scored by Bruce Broughton Category:Films about giants Category:1992 comedy films ","title":"Honey, I Blew Up the Kid"},{"id":"924803","text":"The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) is the independent body that checks on standards and quality in UK higher education. It conducts quality assessment reviews, develops reference points and guidance for providers, and conducts or commissions research on relevant issues. QAA checks how universities, colleges and alternative providers of UK higher education maintain their academic standards and quality. It does this through external peer review. Reviewers check that the 19 expectations of the Quality Code, agreed and recognised by the UK higher education sector, are met. It also provides advice to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, on institutions' requests for degree awarding powers and the right to be called a university. In addition to its role in sustaining the reputation of UK higher education, QAA also regulates the Access to Higher Education Diploma, a qualification that enables individuals without A Levels or the usual equivalent to enter higher education. QAA works closely with other organisations that have an interest in the reputation of UK higher education, including the Higher Education Academy, Universities UK and GuildHE. Mission and strategic aims QAA's mission is 'to safeguard standards and improve the quality of UK higher education wherever it is delivered around the world'. Its four strategic aims may be summarised as: to address the needs of students; to safeguard standards; to drive improvements; and to improve public understanding of UK higher education. Structure and funding QAA is an independent body, a limited company and a registered charity in England, Wales and Scotland. Its objects and constitution are set out in its Memorandum and Articles of Association. Its board includes representatives of UK universities, funding councils, and students. QAA's funding comes from contracts with UK higher education funding bodies and government departments, subscriptions from UK universities and colleges, commissioned work, and fees from alternative providers required to undergo a review (in order to recruit international students or run courses funded by the Student Loans Company). It has a head office in Gloucester, a Scottish office in Glasgow, and subsidiary offices in London and Cardiff. Role and responsibilities =Higher education review work= UK degree-awarding bodies (mainly universities) set their own standards for the degrees and other qualifications they award (academic degrees), but since most courses are partly or entirely publicly funded (including through student loans) there is a requirement that they undergo external review to demonstrate that a national 'threshold' standard is met, and that quality is satisfactory. QAA is the body that undertakes this independent role in the UK. It does so through processes of peer review. Reviewers have extensive experience of higher education at a senior level, or are current or recent students. While there are some differences between the methods used by QAA to achieve this, they have some key features in common. All reviews check that UK expectations are met; currently this is done by benchmarking the provision against QAA's Quality Code (see below), but at time of writing the Conservative government elected in 2015 has plans to develop a Teaching Excellence Framework which will play a role in the assessment of quality in higher education. Other resources used for benchmarks of academic standards include the 'subject benchmark statements' (maintained by QAA in consultation with the academic community), relevant qualifications and credit frameworks, institutions' own rules and handbooks, standards set by professional bodies, and the European Standards and Guidelines maintained by the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ENQA). Each review results in a published report containing judgements on whether UK expectations are met. Separate judgements comment on academic standards, academic quality, and the public information provided about courses. Reports include recommendations for improvement, citations of good practice, and affirmations of actions taken by the higher education provider to improve since the last review. QAA's review methods are informed by a self-evaluation submitted in advance by each university or college, and by a 'student submission' - a commentary by its students. At time of writing, review places an emphasis on the existence of robust academic management structures, and policies and approaches that enable national expectations to be fulfilled, combined with evidence that this is happening. Evidence is obtained in a variety of ways, including interviews with relevant individuals and structured discussions with student and staff focus groups. QAA reviews do not generally look at individual courses or programmes of study, neither do they review or evaluate students' work. =Guidance on quality and standards= In cooperation with the UK higher education sector, QAA maintains the UK Quality Code for Higher Education (Quality Code - see below), the subject benchmark statements for bachelor's and master's degrees, and other guidance for helping higher education providers to meet agreed UK expectations. Where appropriate, QAA also works with professional, regulatory and statutory bodies, and employers, to ensure that its guidance is fit for purpose. Draft guidance is published on QAA's website (via a tab on the home page), where it is accessible for public consultation before being formally published. The Quality Code The Quality Code (full name: UK Quality Code for Higher Education) sets out 19 expectations that must be met by UK higher education providers that receive any kind of public or student loan funding. The Quality Code replaced the 'Academic Infrastructure' (see below) in 2012 as the main reference point for checking on the quality of UK higher education, having been developed in close consultation with the UK higher education sector. Owned and maintained by QAA, it sets out 'what higher education providers expect of themselves', and 'what students may expect The Quality Code covers: * setting and maintaining standards, as determined by the UK qualifications frameworks and subject benchmark statements, together with other relevant guidance * meeting UK expectations about the quality of the student experience, and seeking ways to enhance this * providing trustworthy and reliable information about courses. Topics covered by its 19 expectations include: * course planning, design and admissions * effective teaching and learning support * effective and timely assessment and feedback * robust and reliable use of external examining * due diligence in managing partnerships with other education providers * listening to students' views and responding to their needs. In 2015 the Quality Code was extended to include the UK 'frameworks for higher education qualifications' (specifying levels for the different higher education qualifications and defining these through 'level descriptors') and the subject benchmark statements (specifying what outcomes - knowledge, understanding, skills and attributes - are expected of bachelor's and master's graduates in specific disciplines). In Scotland the levels are different, being part of the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework). Wales also has an integrated academic credit and qualifications framework, while England has a separate credit framework maintained by QAA. Higher education providers use the Quality Code, in conjunction with their own internal policies and other guidance, to design the programmes of study that lead to their higher education awards (including academic degrees). QAA reviewers use it to check that expectations are met when they conduct a review. Other guidance QAA provides other guidance to supplement the Quality Code (but which unlike the Quality Code is advisory rather than mandatory). The Higher Education Credit Framework for England (see previous note) enables providers to allocate a credit tariff to courses and modules. Other guidance documents help universities and colleges to address particular student needs, such as learning about sustainable practices or enterprise and entrepreneurship, or they inform the public and students about the higher education experience, for example the balance between self-directed and structured learning. QAA conducts or sponsors research projects and consultation events relating to quality in UK higher education and publishes guidance on topical issues. It also publishes analysis of the collective findings of its reports to identify emergent trends. =Investigation of complaints and concerns= QAA investigates allegations of 'systemic failings' by higher education providers, whereas the Office of the Independent Adjudicator deals with individual complaints and grievances. Both systems are designed as a recourse for students who have already asked for an internal investigation into their complaint and have not found the outcome of this to be satisfactory. Systemic failings are taken to mean a failure by a university or college in meeting its responsibilities for standards and quality. The concern needs to be supported by evidence. Where QAA deems a full investigation necessary it publishes its findings in a report. =Advisory role on degree awarding powers and university title= QAA advises the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, via government ministers, on the merits of applications for degree awarding powers or the right to be called a university. No organisation may award degrees or call itself a university in the UK unless authorised to do so by the government. Applications are considered by a dedicated QAA committee, the UK Advisory Committee on Degree Awarding Powers, enabling its board to offer advice to ministers. =Regulation of the Access to Higher Education Diploma= QAA is the regulator for the Access to Higher Education Diploma which enables adults without A-Levels or their equivalent to progress to higher education. Organisations known as Access Validating Agencies (AVAs) are responsible for validating and reviewing Access courses and awarding the Diploma to successful students. QAA licenses and monitors the AVAs and publishes information about its findings. International relations QAA conducts reviews of locations where courses are provided by, or on behalf of, UK degree-awarding bodies. It is a member of ENQA, and of the International Network for Quality Assurance Agencies (INQAAHE), meeting the quality criteria of both organisations in full. In 2014 the agency was added to the European Quality Assurance Register (EQAR). Having signed memoranda of cooperation with a number of overseas quality assurance bodies, QAA has been endorsed by the Asia Pacific Quality Network (APQN) for promoting international cooperation in quality assurance. History In 1996 the Joint Planning Group for Quality Assurance in Higher Education recommended that the then two streams of quality assurance in higher education - Subject Review and Academic Audit (which had been in use since 1991) - should be brought together under a single body. In April 1997.QAA was established through the transfer of functions and staff from the former Higher Education Quality Council and the quality assessment divisions of HEFCE and HEFCW. =The Dearing Report and its legacy= The Dearing Report published in 1997 \\"gave the QAA the remit of providing assurance about standards and quality\\" , following which it developed a higher education qualifications framework, a code of practice and subject benchmark statements, and established a pool of external examiners. This laid the foundations for the so-called Academic Infrastructure, which QAA developed between 1997 and 2001 (a set of UK benchmarks for quality and standards) and the development of a new, UK-wide process of Academic Review which comprised elements of both Subject Review and Academic Audit - with an emphasis on the latter. The new process was introduced in Scotland, but before it had become fully operational across the UK a number of English universities complained about the administrative burden that this approach entailed, leading to a rethink by the Westminster government. The Scottish and Welsh higher education authorities took this opportunity to set up their own national arrangements, while in England QAA worked with the bodies representing higher education institutions (Universities UK and Guild HE) to devise a modified approach known as Institutional Audit. QAA Scotland developed the procedure known as Enhancement-Led Institutional Review (ELIR), while in Wales the method known as Institutional Review was established. Northern Ireland followed England and adopted Institutional Audit. QAA remained the organisation charged with developing and undertaking these activities. It was agreed that in England there would be a transitional period of three years (2002 to 2005) during which all higher education institutions would undergo their first Institutional Audit. Thereafter audits would take place on a six-yearly cycle. In the year prior to their audit, institutions underwent 'developmental engagements' - unpublished subject-based reviews to support internal quality assurance. There were also 'discipline audit trails' (DATs) - selective subject-based enquiries that enabled a phased reduction of the subject focus of QAA reviews. In 2005 a revised Institutional Audit model was developed and adopted with the agreement of the representative bodies and HEFCE. This removed the DATs, thereby freeing time in the audit process to explore a broader range of topics and themes. This model continued in use on a six-year cycle until 2011. =Criticism and reform= In 2008 an urgent parliamentary inquiry was ordered into allegations, made in a lecture by Professor Geoffrey Alderman at the University of Buckingham, concerning the decline of academic standards in British higher education and the alleged role of the Quality Assurance Agency in that decline. At the parliamentary inquiry (17 July 2008) the chairman of the House of Commons' Select Committee on Universities condemned the Agency as 'a toothless old dog' and declared that the British degree classification system had 'descended into farce.' Alderman himself gave evidence to the Select Committee, whose report (2 August 2009) amounted to a strong endorsement of his views. In October 2009 a new Chief Executive was appointed (Anthony McClaran, formerly of UCAS), and measures were put in place to strengthen QAA's reputation. These included an agenda to increase student participation and public engagement. =The Browne Report and policy change= The Browne Report (October 2010) commissioned by the Labour government, and the subsequent White Paper 'Students at the heart of the system' published by the new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in summer 2011 had a substantial impact on QAA's work. The introduction of tuition fees led to increased focus on how quality in higher education was managed and verified. Between 2011 and 2013, in consultation with the higher education sector, QAA phased in a new Quality Code to replace the Academic Infrastructure, and developed a new method of Institutional Review applicable to degree-awarding bodies in England and Northern Ireland, and (with some variation) in Wales. Under a separate method QAA also continued to review degree courses provided at further education colleges (validated by universities). =Designation to review alternative providers= In spring 2011, under the coalition government, the UK Border Agency announced a requirement for all private colleges that recruit students to UK higher education to undergo a standards and quality review by QAA. A successful outcome would be essential in order to obtain 'Tier 4 accreditation' also known as 'highly trusted sponsor' status. QAA accordingly conducted 260 of these 'educational oversight' reviews in the first two years of operation, with 29 providers failing their review. Since the abolition of UKBA, QAA has continued this work under the auspices of UK Visas and Immigration. =Continuing questions about quality and risk= Following the coalition government's policy changes there was considerable opening up of higher education to more private providers, leading questions to be raised about the efficacy of the quality assurance system. It was thought by many opinion formers and academics that the 'burden' of review needed to be adjusted according to the 'risk' posed by a particular institution. There was an appetite for established universities to be subject to a lighter touch than further education colleges or new private providers. In 2012 the Science and Technology Committee of the House of Lords, after considering the working of QAA, concluded that it was still not fit for purpose because its reviews were based on a 'threshold level' of standards that 'allowed no assessment of quality above that threshold' (paragraph 124) and that more needed to be done to improve quality (paragraph 125). The report recommended that QAA should involve employers in the development of subject benchmark statements and in the quality assurance of standards (paragraphs 130-132). Accordingly, in parallel with its recently introduced 'educational oversight' review methods, QAA developed Higher Education Review, which accommodated more flexibility and was applicable to all institutions subscribing to QAA (recognised and listed bodies).

The last Cavalcade of Jazz concert was a tribute to the city's most prominent r&b; jocks- Charles Trammel, Huggy Boy and Jim Randolph teamed up with Hancock. Lionel Hampton, Big Jay McNeely, Dinah Washington, Betty Carter, Billy Eckstine, Jimmy Witherspoon, Louis Jordan, Nat \\"King\\" Cole, Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Sam Cooke were just a few of the numerous artists that performed over the years. Hancock also appeared briefly on the L.A. CBS TV station, KNXT in 1955 with the Friday night show \\"Rhythm and Bluesville\\", interviewing such musicians as Duke Ellington, Fats Domino, Little Richard, Gene & Eunice and The Platters. For several years, the Pulse survey rated Hancock's shows No. 1 among black listeners in Southern California. In 1950, the Los Angeles Sentinel newspaper rated Hancock the most popular DJ in Los Angeles among blacks. He was also one of the first DJs to play rock and roll music, and landed a cameo spot in a 1957 British rock and roll film called Rock Around the World. A recreated example of Mr. Hancock's program on Los Angeles' former R&B; radio station KGFJ can be found on Ron Jacobs' \\"Cruisin' 1959\\" (Increase Records INCR 5-2004). This recreation includes several classic R&B; songs of that era, contemporary commercials (e.g., Champion spark plugs, the Saturday Evening Post, and others), and DJ patter.

It is the indirect sequel to Without Remorse, and is chronologically the first book featuring Jack Ryan, the main character in most of Clancy‚Äôs novels. The novel focuses on Ryan being the target of Irish terrorist group Ulster Liberation Army for thwarting their kidnapping attempt on the Prince and Princess of Wales in London. It debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list. A film adaptation, starring Harrison Ford as Ryan, premiered on June 5, 1992. Plot summary A kidnapping attempt on the Prince and Princess of Wales and their infant son occurs at the Mall in London. The attack is orchestrated by members of the Ulster Liberation Army, an ideologically Maoist and ultra-radical Irish terrorist group splintered from the Provisional Irish Republican Army. However, Jack Ryan, who happens to be nearby, interferes with their operation, incapacitating one of the attackers, Sean Miller, and killing the other, John Michael McCrory. During the gun battle, Ryan is shot in the shoulder by McCrory as they exchange fire. Miller is later arrested. While recovering from his shoulder wound, Ryan is honored by the British government and later becomes a knight. Meanwhile, Miller is sentenced to life imprisonment for the kidnapping attempt; however, his ULA compatriots led by Kevin O‚ÄôDonnell free him while he is being transported to a maximum security prison in the Isle of Wight. They are then aided by Libyan allies in escaping into their secret training camp in the North African desert. Miller vows revenge on Ryan for making his recent operation fail. Ryan is back teaching history in the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, relieved with the fact that the ULA will not attack him in the United States. Unbeknownst to him, Miller had persuaded his superior O‚ÄôDonnell to launch an operation in the U.S. aimed at targeting Ryan and his family, and had recruited the assistance of an African-American domestic terrorist group referred to as ‚Äúthe Movement‚Äù to do so. While the op is an act of revenge, it is also designed to reduce American support for the rival PIRA, which is to be blamed for the upcoming attack. The assassin sent to kill Ryan at his place of work is intercepted before he manages to complete his task. However, his wife Cathy and their daughter Sally are seriously injured when Miller causes their car to crash on a freeway; they are later transported by helicopter to the University of Maryland Medical Center for treatment. After the attack on his family, Ryan accepts an offer from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to start working as an analyst at their headquarters, partly to collect more information about the previously little-known ULA. Later, the Prince and Princess of Wales come to visit Ryan at his house in Maryland. However, this provides another opportunity for the ULA to strike, once again recruiting the services of ‚Äúthe Movement‚Äù. The night of the visit, they launch a sneak attack on Ryan‚Äôs home and kidnap the Prince and Princess of Wales, as well as Ryan‚Äôs family. Although several guards around the house, including Secret Service personnel, are killed, Ryan, his friend, fighter pilot Robert ‚ÄúRobby‚Äù Jackson, and the Prince manage to kill some of the terrorists. They later receive assistance from the local police, the United States Marines, and sailors from the U.S. Naval Academy, who prevent the remaining terrorists from escaping the country in a container ship. Ryan encounters a cornered Miller and tries to kill him, but is restrained by his weapons instructor. After the ULA terrorists are apprehended, he arrives in Annapolis to witness the birth of his son, Jack Ryan, Jr. Characters * Jack Ryan: History teacher at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland; later an analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency. * Dr. Caroline \\"Cathy\\" Ryan: Ophthalmic surgeon at the Wilmer Eye Institute, which is part of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine; Jack Ryan's wife. * Olivia \\"Sally\\" Ryan: Jack and Cathy Ryan's daughter. * Prince of Wales * Princess of Wales * Special Agent Daniel E. \\"Dan\\" Murray: Legal attach√© for the FBI at the United States Embassy in London. * James \\"Jimmy\\" Owens: English police officer specializing in anti- terrorism operations. * Robby Jackson: Fighter pilot and instructor at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland; Jack Ryan's friend. * Sean Miller: Operations officer for the Ulster Liberation Army (ULA). * Kevin Joseph O‚ÄôDonnell: Leader of the ULA. * James Greer: CIA Deputy Director of Intelligence.

Themes Patriot Games was notable for subverting the moral ambiguity of the antagonists in espionage novels by John le Carr√©, Len Deighton, and Robert Ludlum. According to Marc Cerasini‚Äôs essay on the novel, ‚ÄúClancy‚Äôs sensible revulsion toward the terrorists is so strident and intense...that it verges on the physical.‚Äù He added that ‚Äúthe author‚Äôs understandable disgust toward his villains is ‚Äòbourgeois‚Äô, for there is not a shred of sympathy for these Irish ‚Äòpatriots‚Äô.‚Äù The novel is also said to be inspired by the gothic horror genre in the depiction of the ULA as ‚Äútwisted political misfits‚Äù who practice political violence in the vein of Count Dracula and his ‚Äúfamily‚Äù, as well as other gothic elements like the presence of the Prince and Princess of Wales. Development Clancy started working on Patriot Games in 1979, along with other novels which would later be published: The Hunt for Red October (1984) and The Cardinal of the Kremlin (1988). He says of his passion for accuracy and detail: \\"When I was in London, researching Patriot Games, I spent 20 hours walking around the Mall with a camera, clipboard and tape recorder, just choreographing my opening chapter, to make sure it would happen exactly the way I wrote it. Later, when I took my kids there, I could tell them, 'This is the tree that Jack Ryan hid his wife and daughter behind, and that's the road where the bad guys escaped.' I feel a moral obligation to my readers to get it right. In the insurance business, you have to pay attention to details or a client could lose everything. A doctor has to, a cop, a fireman, why not a writer?\\" Although he was criticized for doubling down on technical details in the novel, Clancy considers Patriot Games to be his best. Discussing the final scene where Jack Ryan lets the primary antagonist Sean Miller live instead of killing him, Clancy remarked: \\"Of all the letters I got on Patriot Games, not one said, 'He should have killed the little bastard.' Personally I'd have done it. You harm my kids and I'll blow you away. You don't touch my kids. But I'm not Jack Ryan. He has to be in control. He plays by the rules.\\" Reception Commercially, Patriot Games debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list for the week of August 2, 1987. It has since sold over 1,063,000 hardcover copies by the next year. Critically, the book received generally positive reviews. The New York Times praised it as \\"a powerful piece of popular fiction; its plot, if implausible, is irresistible, and its emotions are universal.\\" However, Kirkus Reviews's verdict is mixed, stating that \\"Exciting shoot-outs and chases, and lots of Royal wish-fulfillment; but without naval authenticity to bolster the prose, Clancy is a fish out of water.\\" Film adaptation The novel was adapted as a feature film, which was released on June 5, 1992. Jack Ryan was played by Harrison Ford and Sean Miller was played by Sean Bean. The film is notable for being the sequel to the previous movie The Hunt for Red October (1990), although the order is the opposite in the books. Additionally, the Prince and Princess of Wales were replaced by Lord Holmes, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Queen's cousin, as the ULA's primary target. Patriot Games spent two weeks as the No. 1 film, eventually grossing $178,051,587 in worldwide box office business. It has garnered generally positive reviews, and earned a 73% \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 33 reviews. Conversely, the movie was criticized by Clancy for deviating too much from the source material, stating that \\"I don't like eating dirt, and I won't eat any from these guys.\\" \\"There is only one, maybe two, scenes in the shooting script that correspond to a scene in the book,\\" Clancy later added. \\"They have a movie called Patriot Games that uses my characters‚Äîbut it's not my story.\\" He eventually asked for his name to be removed from the film's promotional materials, and in an apparent countermove, entered negotiations with the same team at Paramount Pictures to sell the rights to his other novel The Sum of All Fears (1991). By the time the film was released in 2002, the author had cooled off on the idea of having his books made into films.

He played 12 seasons with the Detroit Tigers, one with the Oakland Athletics and one with the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball (MLB). He bats and throws right-handed. Sportswriter Jayson Stark described Inge as a \\"super-utility dervish.\\" In 2006, his diving stop and subsequent throw from his knees to put out Gary Bennett in an interleague game, on June 25 against the St. Louis Cardinals earned him the ESPN defensive play of the year for a third baseman. Early life Inge played baseball at Brookville High School in Lynchburg, Virginia, also playing American Legion Baseball. He was named Legion Baseball's 2010 Graduate of the Year. Brookville retired Inge's uniform number (7). He then attended Virginia Commonwealth University, where he played on the baseball team as a shortstop and relief pitcher. In 1997 he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Bourne Braves. He was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 2nd round in the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft. Career =Detroit Tigers= Inge began his professional career with the Jamestown Jammers, of the Single‚ÄìA New York‚ÄìPenn League. In 51 games, Inge batted .230. His 8 homers, 10 doubles, and 29 RBI were all team‚Äìhigh totals. Previously a shortstop, Inge became a catcher. Inge was promoted to the West Michigan Whitecaps for the 1999 season, making 100 appearances. In June, Inge put together a hitting streak that lasted for 12 games. For the season, he batted .244, with 9 homers and 46 runs batted in. He also stole 15 bases, the highest single‚Äìseason total for his entire baseball career. Inge split the 2000 season between the Double‚ÄìA Jacksonville Suns and the Triple‚ÄìA Toledo Mud Hens. In 78 games with Jacksonville, he hit 6 homers, drove in 53 runs, and compiled a .258 batting average. Inge saw action in 55 games with the Mud Hens, tallying 5 homers and 20 RBI, but only hitting for a .221 average. Inge began 2001 in the majors, debuting as Detroit's starting catcher on opening day and throwing out a pair of Minnesota Twins baserunners in the game. On April 6, he got his first MLB base hit, a double against Chicago White Sox pitcher Jim Parque. On June 24, Inge sustained a dislocated left shoulder. He was put on the disabled list the next day and was out of action for a month before he was sent to the Gulf Coast League Tigers for a brief rehab stint. After three games with the GCL Tigers and four games with West Michigan, Inge joined Toledo on August 2 and he remained there until he was recalled by Detroit on September 1. In 27 games with Toledo, Inge batted .289, with 2 homers, 11 doubles, and 15 runs batted in. Inge appeared in 79 games with the Tigers, batting .180 and posting 11 doubles and 15 RBI. Initially signed as a catcher, Inge struggled offensively in his first three seasons. After the Tigers signed free-agent Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez in , Inge played in the outfield, catcher and at third base, batting .287 with 13 home runs that season. He started 159 games at third base in , and led all AL third basemen in errors (23), assists (378) and double plays (42).2005 American League third basemen fielding statistics Baseball Reference In 2006, Inge exceeded his 2005 totals with 398 assists. That number broke the Detroit Tigers single season record for assists by a 3rd baseman (previously 389 by Aurelio Rodr√≠guez in 1974) and was only 14 short of the all time MLB record for assists by a third baseman (set by Graig Nettles in 1971). Only five third basemen (including Graig Nettles, Brooks Robinson, and Mike Schmidt) have collected more assists in a season than Inge. In 2006, Inge showed power during the first half, with his 17 home runs tying for the team lead. His slugging percentage was .463 and he placed third on the Tigers with 47 RBIs.Brandon Inge 2006 splits Baseball Reference After the All-Star Break, he raised his season average from .221 to .253 and finished with 27 home runs.Brandon Inge profile Baseball Reference On October 27, 2006, Inge struck out vs. St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright for the final out of the 2006 World Series. Inge became expendable at third base after the Tigers acquired Miguel Cabrera in a blockbuster trade with the Florida Marlins. Inge asked management to trade him to a team where he would have a chance to be an everyday player. However, a deal was never made, and the team stated that he would be used as a utility player for the 2008 season. Inge reported to spring training early with the pitchers and catchers. He was named the opening day center fielder after Curtis Granderson was placed on the disabled list. Detroit Tigers in 2008 With the absence of backup catcher Vance Wilson, Inge filled this role for the 13-time Gold Glove winner Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez.

It stars Brendan Fraser, Steve Buscemi, and Adam Sandler as a band of loser musicians who stage a hijacking of a radio station in order to get airplay for their demo recording. Joe Mantegna, Michael McKean, Ernie Hudson, Judd Nelson, David Arquette and Michael Richards play supporting roles. Plot Chazz, Rex and Pip are in a Los Angeles hard rock band called the Lone Rangers who are continuously turned down as they try to get their demo tape heard by producers. After scolding him for being lazy, Chazz's girlfriend Kayla kicks him out of her apartment. They decide to try to get the local rock station KPPX to play their reel-to-reel tape on the air and attempt to break-in through the back door. After several unsuccessful attempts, a station employee comes out to smoke and they keep the door from shutting behind her. Once inside, laid back DJ Ian \\"The Shark\\" begins talking with them on the air. Station Manager Milo overhears them and intervenes but Ian continues broadcasting. After Milo insults Rex, by calling him \\"Hollywood Boulevard trash,\\" he and Chazz pull out realistic-looking water pistols and demand airplay. After setting up an old reel-to-reel for the demo, the tape begins to play but is quickly destroyed when the player malfunctions. The guys try to run but Doug Beech, the station's accountant, had already called the police and they see the building is surrounded. They negotiate with the police who are now tasked to find Kayla who has a cassette of the demo. Since the station never went off the air, news of the hostage crisis travels quickly and numerous hard rock/metal fans begin showing up outside the radio station interfering with police. A SWAT team has also arrived whose leader prefers using force over negotiation tactics. His team secretly passes a gun through a roof vent to Beech who has been hiding in the air ducts. During the crisis, it is revealed that Milo had secretly signed a deal to change KPPX's format to Adult Contemporary, which includes having to fire Ian and most of the other employees. When this comes out, Ian and a few employees side with the band and turn against Milo. The police find Kayla who arrives at the radio station to deliver the tape. However, the tape is damaged because she threw it out of the car earlier. Chazz and Kayla get into an argument that quickly escalates and results in the studio console being destroyed, dashing any hopes to play the tape on the air. As some of the items the band demanded from police are brought into the station, the door shuts on Rex's plastic gun revealing it to be fake. Seeing this, some of the hostages run out; one telling the SWAT team the band's guns are not real. As the team assembles to storm the station, Beech corners the band from a low hanging air vent. Ian, knowing he no longer will have a job at the station, knocks down Beech's gun. This causes the weapon to wildly fire several rounds and the police are forced to back off. Ian picks up the gun but gives it to a somewhat confused Chazz in a final act of anti-establishment rebellion. Jimmie Wing, a self-serving record executive who had previously turned Chazz down, comes to the radio station and offers the band a contract. They reluctantly agree to the deal knowing they have no more options. Wing arranges an entire stage and sound system to be airlifted to the roof where the band will play their song for the now huge crowd outside. To the band's dismay, they find only the PA is real and everything else is just props. Refusing to lip sync as their tape is played, they instead destroy their instruments in protest to the delight of the crowd and stage dive into the hands of the cheering audience. The Lone Rangers are next seen playing a gig inside the prison where they are incarcerated. The concert is being shown live on MTV. Ian, now their manager, says on the phone the band will start touring in six months, or \\"three months if they behave themselves.\\" A final text crawl states that The Lone Rangers served three months for kidnapping, theft, and assault with hot pepper sauce, with their album LIVE IN PRISON going triple platinum.

She was named for Rear Admiral Edwin Alexander Anderson, Jr., a Medal of Honor recipient. Anderson was laid down on 15 November 1937 at Kearny, New Jersey, by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company; launched on 4 February 1939; sponsored by Mrs. Mertie Loraine Anderson, the widow of Rear Admiral Anderson; towed to the New York Navy Yard, and delivered there to the Navy on 18 May 1939; and commissioned on 19 May 1939, Lieutenant Commander William M. Hobby, Jr., in command. Service history =Inter-War Period= USS Anderson on 18 May 1939, just before commissioning Anderson was the first of the Sims class to be delivered in early 1939, and was found to be 150 tons overweight and dangerously top-heavy due to insufficient metacentric height. This touched off a redesign and rebuilding of the class, completed during 1941. One 5 inch gun (No. 3) and one quad torpedo tube mount were removed, with another torpedo tube mount relocated to the centerline.Friedman, p. 94 It was determined that an underestimate by the Bureau of Engineering of the weight of a new machinery design was responsible and that the Bureau of Construction and Repair did not have sufficient authority to detect or correct the error during the design process. This eventually led to the consolidation of the previous bureaus into the new Bureau of Ships on 20 June 1940. After commissioning, Anderson remained at the New York Navy Yard through June, fitting out, during which time she contributed a landing party of sailors to march in the New York City Flag Day parade on 14 June 1939. Underway from her berth on 5 July, Anderson reached Newport, Rhode Island, on 7 July, mooring to the east dock at the Naval Torpedo Station, and taking on board torpedo warheads, exploders, and test equipment before returning to the New York Navy Yard the next day, pausing there only briefly before getting underway later that afternoon for Washington, D.C. Anchoring off Quantico on the night of 9 July, Anderson steamed up the Potomac River, rendering the prescribed passing honors abeam of Mount Vernon, and arrived at the Washington Navy Yard at 0721 on 10 July. The next day, a number of high-ranking officers informally inspected the new destroyer, the first of the Sims-class to be placed in commission, Admiral Harold R. Stark, the Chief of Naval Operations, accompanied by Captain H. T. Markland; Rear Admirals Robert L. Ghormley, Director of War Plans, and William R. Furlong, Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, as well as Charles Edison, the Acting Secretary of the Navy. On 12 July, assisted by and , Anderson got underway for Yorktown, Virginia. She loaded depth charges at the mine depot at Yorktown before moving to the Naval Operating Base (NOB) at Norfolk before getting underway on 14 July for Wilmington, North Carolina. Wilmington was the hometown of the man for whom the ship had been named, Admiral Anderson; and it accorded the ship a warm welcome. The local paper editorialized: \\"It is a pleasure to have you in port and to inspect the magnificent new destroyer named in honor of a distinguished son. The ship and its personnel are a credit to the record and memory of the man for whom your ship is named... Therefore, we bid you welcome, and if there is aught that can add to your entertainment while here, you have but to ask any resident and it is yours...\\" Anderson gave a tea for Mrs. Anderson, members of the late flag officer's family, and the city officials of Wilmington on the afternoon of 17 July. On the next day, assisted out into the stream by the tug Battler, the destroyer made a departure from Wilmington. Reaching NOB, Norfolk, on 19 July, Anderson shifted to the Norfolk Navy Yard that same day to take onboard ammunition. After embarking six enlisted Marines for transportation to the Marine Barracks at Guantanamo Bay, Anderson got underway on 21 July for Cuban waters and the initial part of her shakedown cruise. Arriving at Guantanamo on 24 July, the destroyer disembarked her passengers before operating locally over the next few days. Anderson then visited San Juan, Puerto Rico (from 1‚Äì5 August); Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone (8‚Äì14 August); and Hamilton, Bermuda (19‚Äì21 August); St. John's, Newfoundland (25‚Äì28 August); before she reached Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on the morning of 31 August. Underway on 5 September, the destroyer called briefly at Quebec (5 to 6 September) before she headed for Newport. On 8 September, while en route, Anderson sighted a merchantman eight miles (13 km) distant, identifying her as Norwegian by the display of national colors on ship's side. Soon thereafter, a plane, identified as \\"British\\" (possibly Royal Canadian Air Force) by the wing markings, circled Anderson at low altitude, obviously scrutinizing the ship thoroughly before banking away and heading for the coast. Anderson made arrival at the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport the following day, 9 September, and over the next few days served as the underway \\"target\\" for torpedo practice conducted by on the testing range in Narragansett Bay. On 16 September, Anderson arrived back at the New York Navy Yard, her shakedown completed, for the installation of her main battery director. After brief periods underway for testing fire control equipment (21‚Äì22 September), Anderson took a departure from New York for NOB, Norfolk, arriving on 24 September. Anderson conducted gunnery exercises on the Southern Drill Grounds off the Virginia Capes, firing at a target towed by on 26 September before firing antiaircraft battery practice on 28 September. She arrived at the New York Navy Yard for post-shakedown availability on the morning of 1 October; these repairs and alterations continuing through the end of January 1940. The destroyer then touched briefly at the Boston Navy Yard before she ran her final acceptance trials off Rockland, Maine, on 7 February 1940, with Rear Admiral H. L. Brinser, president of the Board of Inspection and Survey, embarked. Anderson then paid a return visit to the Boston Navy Yard on 9 February before returning to New York, via the Cape Cod Canal, Buzzards Bay and Oyster Bay, on 12 February. Anderson remained at the Navy Yard through the end of March, after which time she sailed for Newport, for torpedo firing tests on 10 April. At 1130 on 12 April, the destroyer embarked the Honorable John Z. Anderson, a California Congressman and member of the House Naval Affairs Committee, and got underway shortly thereafter, reaching NOB, Norfolk, and mooring to Pier 7, at 2008 the following day, disembarking her passenger the next morning. Underway in company with , Anderson stood out, headed for Guantanamo Bay, on the afternoon of 15 April. The next day, 14 hours out of Norfolk, the ships ran into heavy weather. At 0440 on 16 April, the strongback of the port lifeboat was reported to be cracked. Lieutenant George R. Phelan, the executive officer, gathered men of the deck force in the lee of the galley, amidships, as the ship steered various courses in an attempt to lessen the roll and thereby facilitate efforts to secure the port lifeboat. Between rolls, Lieutenant Phelan and his men attempted to recover the boat and make it fast, but the effort soon became too dangerous, not worth the lives of the men, and the work had to be abandoned, the boat carrying away completely at 0718. Ultimately, Anderson reached Guantanamo Bay at 0618 on 19 April. Underway again nine hours later, Anderson, again in company with Manley, reached the submarine base at Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, on 21 April. Transiting the Panama Canal on 23 April, Anderson proceeded independently up the west coast of Central America, reaching Acapulco, Mexico, on the 27th. The next morning, following by nine hours the visit of Commander W. M. Dillon, the naval attach√© at the United States Embassy in Mexico City, Anderson sent ashore a working party to bring off \\"naval stores salvaged from the wreck\\" of (listed in the 1941 Merchant Vessel Register as \\"abandoned\\" during the previous year). Underway again four hours later, Anderson rejoined Manley on 30 April, and reached San Diego at 0900 on 1 May 1940. After conducting a brief harbor cruise with 85 Army reservists embarked on 18 May, Anderson got underway to conduct a neutrality patrol off the coast of southern California. During the course of this operation on 20 May, the destroyer sighted a tug five miles (8 km) away at 0945 and altered course to close and investigate. Closer examination revealed Ray P. Clark, towing a barge laden with horses and bales of hay and flying a distress signal. Anderson immediately called away her fire and rescue party and stopped to render assistance, help which turned out to be only giving directions to the tug which had become lost and needed the course to San Nicolas Island. The assistance duly rendered, Anderson continued on her appointed rounds, arriving back at San Diego on the morning of 23 May. The warship commenced the month of June as plane guard for , as that carrier conducted local operations out of North Island; she later planeguarded for from 19‚Äì21 June, interspersed with type training and gunnery practices out of Pyramid Cove, San Clemente Island. At 0900 on 22 June, as the ship prepared to sail for Hawaiian waters, Commander Allan E. Smith reported on board and broke his pennant in Anderson as Commander, Destroyer Division 3 (DesDiv 3); Anderson subsequently took a departure from San Diego on the morning of 25 June, sailing in company with Enterprise and , , , and . During the passage to Hawaii, Anderson alternated with the other destroyers in standing plane guard duty for Enterprise and then serving as an antisubmarine screen. On 28 June, during morning flight operations, a plane from Scouting Squadron (VS) 6 lost power after being catapulted from the flight deck and was forced to ditch. Hammann arrived on the scene first and rescued the pilot and his radioman, Enterprise later drew alongside the plane and recovered it. Subsequently, Anderson covered the arrival of the force at Pearl Harbor and then followed it in, mooring on the morning of 2 July. For the next five months, Anderson operated locally put of Pearl Harbor and Lahaina Roads. Her operations within the Hawaiian chain took her to Palmyra (22 July) and Christmas Island (23 July); and included such evolutions as antiaircraft and machine gun practices; battle depth charge practices, and torpedo practices, often operating in company with destroyers, light cruisers, and battleships. Interspersed were periods of upkeep back at Pearl Harbor alongside between 26 and 28 October, and drydocking (28 to 29 October and again from 30 October to 4 November). The ship also patrolled assigned areas adjacent to the Lahaina Roads anchorage, off Maui, and off Honolulu and Pearl Harbor, intercepting and identifying many merchantmen, and local craft, such as fishing boats, as well as noting the movements of American warships. Following this intensive period of operations in Hawaiian waters, Anderson took a departure from Pearl Harbor on 2 December 1940, bound for the West Coast in company with the rest of Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 8. Arriving at San Diego on the afternoon of 8 December, Anderson steamed to the Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, San Pedro, California, the day after Christmas, and underwent an overhaul there through the first week of January 1941. Then, after operating locally out of Long Beach and San Diego, Anderson took a departure from San Diego on the morning of 14 January and rendezvoused with Enterprise and off San Pedro. The force conducted drills and exercises en route to the Hawaiian Islands, reaching Pearl Harbor on the morning of 21 January. Anderson resumed operations in the Hawaiian area on 12 February, conducting such evolutions as depth charge practices, night battle practice runs, and gunnery drills, until returning to Pearl Harbor on 19 February. Underway again two days later she conducted more gunnery runs and damage control problems before returning to port that afternoon to provision from the storeship . Underway again on the morning of 22 February, Anderson patrolled off the entrance to Pearl Harbor and encountered a fishing craft trespassing in a security zone; lowering her motor whaleboat, Anderson investigated the craft and warned her owner to keep away from those waters. Anderson returned to Pearl Harbor the next morning, 23 February, before resuming the intensive schedule of operations with the other ships in her division that lasted through the end of February. During March 1941, Anderson continued the rapid pace of operations out of Pearl Harbor, operating with the fleet and honing her skills in antisubmarine warfare tactics and in gunnery. She also operated for a time with Yorktown as plane guard. During flight operations on the morning of 17 March 1941, two TBD Devastators from Torpedo Squadron 5 collided at and crashed into the sea, from the carrier. Yorktowns boats recovered the bodies of the pilots, but both planes sank in 2,910 fathoms (5,320 m) of water, carrying the other four men ‚Äì two in each aircraft ‚Äì with them. Anderson ‚Äî detailed to remain in the vicinity and continue the search ‚Äì found only small parts of the planes and pieces of clothing. These evolutions in Hawaiian waters proved to be the last for some time; Anderson got underway for the West Coast of the United States shortly after noon on 24 March, and reached Mare Island Navy Yard on the last day of the month after first disembarking, at San Francisco, enlisted passengers transported from Pearl Harbor. The destroyer spent all of April 1941 undergoing repairs and alterations at the West Coast yard, and on 16 May got underway for her post- repair trials. After operating briefly in San Francisco Bay, Anderson shifted to Long Beach on 21 May, and eight days later, took a departure, ostensibly, for the Hawaiian Islands, in company with her division mates, Hammann, Mustin, and Rowan. The ships soon received a change of orders. They rendezvoused with on the afternoon of 30 May, and soon proceeded down the coast, bound for Panama, as another increment of the Pacific Fleet was withdrawn to augment the Atlantic Fleet in its undeclared war with the German Navy in the Atlantic. =Atlantic Neutrality Patrols= Transiting the Panama Canal on the night of 8‚Äì9 June, Anderson, her hull number and name painted out for security reasons, passed the Cristobal breakwater at 0125 on 9 June, en route to Guantanamo Bay. Fueling there on 11 June, Anderson got underway the same afternoon, quickly taking up antisubmarine screening station off the port bow of , which she escorted up the eastern seaboard to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, arriving there on 15 June. The respite in port proved brief, however, since Anderson took a departure early on the morning of 19 June. Joined by shortly thereafter, the destroyer stood down the Delaware River, and out into the Atlantic. They joined the following morning, and, later, shortly after noon on 21 June. Together, these ships proceeded out into the central Atlantic on neutrality patrol, cruising almost as far as the Cape Verde Islands, \\"safeguarding the neutrality of the United States.\\" Their voyage took them almost to the edge of the zones defined in operations orders of April and June 1941. Anderson served as plane guard for Wasp and as an antisubmarine screen for the carrier and for Tuscaloosa during the patrol that ultimately came to an end at Bermuda on Independence Day, 1941. After a brief period in Bermudan waters, a break she utilized for a short stint of close-range battle practice, Anderson took a departure on 12 July for Norfolk, reaching her destination the following day. After getting underway from the Tidewater region for torpedo practice on 17 July, the warship sailed north for Boston, and reached the Boston Navy Yard on the afternoon of 19 July. Anderson then underwent repairs and alterations into early August; during her time in the yard, her number three 5 inch (127 mm) mount was removed to save topside weight and allow the fitting of additional .50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns, extensions to her depth charge tracks, and a \\"Y\\"-gun (depth charge projector), in addition to two dozen additional depth charges. Thus refitted to better perform the escort role needed in the developing Battle of the Atlantic, she participated in intensive antisubmarine exercises out of Provincetown, Massachusetts, during the latter half of August 1941 before returning to Boston on the 30th. Andersons operations now carried her farther north, as she sailed for Casco Bay, Maine, on 2 September, exercising with Tuscaloosa en route. Assigned to Task Force 15 (TF 15), Anderson steamed as part of the escort force for the first major reinforcement convoy bound for Iceland, carrying an Army brigade to augment the Marines who had been there since July. The ships reached Reykjav√≠k on the evening of 15 September after a passage enlivened by two \\"submarine\\" contacts in Andersons vicinity: one summarily depth-charged by on 8 September, the other by on the 10th. Then, between 26 September and 3 October, Anderson escorted a convoy to Placentia Bay, Newfoundland. Anderson remained at Placentia Bay for almost a week before getting underway on 10 October as part of the antisubmarine screen for TF 14, formed around Yorktown. This force reached Casco Bay, Maine, on the afternoon of 13 October. Moving down to Provincetown, Anderson again conducted antisubmarine exercises, and as in previous practices, the ship's performance was \\"outstanding in detecting the presence of a submarine and carrying out a successful attack.\\" Later, after a tender availability alongside at Casco Bay, she resumed her operations at sea with TF 14. Standing out of Casco Bay on the afternoon of 26 October, with Task Group 14.3 (TG 14.3), , , , Yorktown, and seven destroyers as the escort for a convoy of six British cargo ships bound for the British Isles, Anderson, in the inner anti-submarine screen, plane guarded for the carrier as she conducted flight operations covering the convoy as it moved out into the Atlantic. On 30 October, from St. John's, Newfoundland, Yorktown had just completed recovering planes and was proceeding to refuel when, at 1219, Anderson made an underwater contact, distant. Anderson went to general quarters immediately and proceeded ahead to develop the contact dropping a standard pattern of six depth charges at 1225. Five minutes later, dropped an \\"embarrassing barrage\\". Other ships in the vicinity, however, began sighting porpoises and blackfish, leading Commander Frank G. Fahrion, Commander, DesDiv 3 in Anderson, to report over the high-frequency radio (TBS) to Morris that, in view of the fish sightings, the contact was a false one. Soon thereafter, however, Andersons men saw an oil slick and lowered a bucket that, when drawn up, contained a mixture of oil, water, and burnt TNT. At 1305, the destroyer picked up a propeller noise and attacked with a second pattern of six depth charges. Soon thereafter, , also in on the \\"hunt\\", picked up a contact and requested Anderson to develop it. The latter dropped another pattern in 1409. Anderson secured from general quarters at 1421, and then, in company with Hughes, tried to develop further contacts or to obtain concrete evidence of a \\"kill.\\" Unfortunately, it appeared that their quarry had escaped. After securing from the search at 1503, Anderson remained with TF 14 until detached on 6 November. At 1637 on that same day, while steaming in company with Hammann, Anderson sighted an unidentified ship which instituted radical course changes when she apparently sighted the two American destroyers. As Hammann parted company, Anderson investigated the stranger, finding her to be , steaming singly from Belfast, Northern Ireland, to Halifax, Nova Scotia. The destroyer then trailed the tanker for a time until securing from the effort at 2246. Reaching Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur on 7 November and fueling from upon arrival, Anderson then spent the next month operating in Icelandic waters, out of Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur (\\"Valley Forge\\") and Reykjav√≠k (\\"Rinky Dink\\"). The ship's last \\"peacetime\\" operations consisted of a sweep, in company with Idaho and from Reykjav√≠k across the southern end of the Denmark Strait, between Iceland and Greenland, between 1 and 6 December 1941. =World War II= Atlantic Underway from Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur, Iceland, on the morning of 9 December 1941, two days after the Japanese attack upon the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, halfway across the globe, Anderson reached the Norfolk Navy Yard on 17 December, tarrying only a short time before taking a departure at 0537 on 18 December for Charleston, South Carolina in company with Hammann, Mustin, and Morris, and reaching their destination the following morning. Unloading ammunition the following day, Anderson spent the rest of 1941 undergoing repairs and alterations at the Charleston Navy Yard, including the replacement of her .50-caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns with 20 mm antiaircraft guns. Three days into 1942, Anderson sailed for Norfolk, Virginia and after calibrating her degaussing gear on the Wolf Trap degaussing range, near Norfolk, the destroyer arrived at NOB, Norfolk, on the morning of 5 January. mi Once again, the respite in port proved brief, and at midday on 6 January, Anderson cleared Hampton Roads in company with Morris and Hammann, ultimately taking a screening position on the port beam of Mississippi in the force escorting the battlewagons of BatDiv 3 back to the Pacific Ocean. Pacific Over the next four days, the destroyers guarded New Mexico, Mississippi, and as they headed down the East Coast of the United States and across the Gulf of Mexico. Reaching Cristobal on the morning of 11 January, Anderson transited the Panama Canal during the day, mooring at Balboa that afternoon. After taking on fuel, the destroyer was underway once more, that evening, bound for San Diego, California. On the second leg of the voyage, all ships remained alert. Within two days of a departure from Panama, Andersons lookouts reported a torpedo track at 0113 on 13 January. Over the next four days, the ships sighted, challenged and identified two ships, both of which proved to be friendly: the British-registry Ocean Voice and the American- registry Kishacoquillas, on 15 and 17 January, respectively. During the passage, the ships honed up their gunnery skills, and OS2U Kingfishers simulated dive, torpedo, and high-level bombing attacks on the convoy. Off San Francisco Bay, the submarine jitters struck again, this time as Hammann reported a contact on the morning of 22 January and depth charged the \\"contact\\" with negative results. The odyssey from the East Coast completed, Anderson moored in a nest at Pier 54, San Francisco, at 1250 on 22 January 1942. Anderson subsequently unmoored on the morning of 25 January, after having undergone a brief tender availability in a nest alongside and stood out of San Francisco Bay, bound for a rendezvous with Convoy 2019. Hampered by the typical foggy conditions surrounding the bay area, assembly took some time, but ultimately, with all units present and accounted for, the convoy set out for the Hawaiian Islands. Anderson covered the entry of the ships into the Pearl Harbor channel shortly before noon on 2 February. Anderson spent the next two weeks either at or operating locally from Pearl Harbor. Her underway periods included a turn at the Pearl Harbor entrance patrol (11‚Äì12 February) and duty screening as that ship conducted gunnery exercises on 14 February. Underway at 0817 on 16 February, Anderson stood out to sea, joining up with Task Force 17 (TF17), consisting of Yorktown, , Louisville, Hammann, Sims, and Walke, under Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher, later that afternoon. The next two weeks found the Yorktown task force working its way toward the southwest Pacific. On 6 March 1942, TF 17 rendezvoused with TF 11 under Vice Admiral Wilson Brown, to raid the Japanese stronghold of Rabaul. While Brown's and Fletcher's ships were en route to that area, however, Australian reconnaissance planes detected a Japanese invasion force moving toward the settlements of Lae and Salamaua, on the eastern coast of New Guinea. Both fell with little resistance, but the incipient enemy base, and the airfields at both places, presented the Allies with a fine new target, and a chance to get back at the enemy at his most vulnerable time ‚Äì before he had consolidated his beachhead. The raid on Rabaul was shelved. To provide security for the carriers' operations in the Gulf of Papua, Brown detached a surface force to remain in the waters of the Louisiade Archipelago, near Rossel Island, to intercept any enemy thrust toward Port Moresby and cover the arrival of Army troops scheduled to arrive at about that time at Noum√©a, New Caledonia. He placed this force, Astoria, , Louisville, , Anderson, Sims, Hammann, and Hughes, under Rear Admiral John G. Grace, Royal Navy. While the patrol proved uneventful for Grace's ships, which rejoined TF 11 on 14 March, the Lae- Salamaua raid carried out by planes from Yorktown and Lexington forced the Japanese to husband carefully their amphibious resources, already on the proverbial \\"shoestring\\", for their planned operations in the Solomon Islands. Anderson, operated with Yorktown through late April, patrolling the Coral Sea as the sole barrier against Japanese expansion in that region, putting into Tongatapu, in the Tonga (or \\"Friendly\\") Islands, late that month. With intelligence data indicating that the postponed movement against Tulagi, in the Solomons, was imminent‚Äîconfirmed by the Japanese landing men and supplies there on 29 April and establishing a seaplane base on the heels of the retreating Australian garrison, TF 17 moved north to deal with this threat. =Battle of the Coral Sea= On 4 May, Anderson, her men \\"anxious to get a chance to attack\\" the enemy, screened Yorktown as she launched three attacks on the incipient base at Tulagi, the carrier's planes sinking a destroyer and some small auxiliaries, at the relatively modest cost of only three aircraft (whose crews were later recovered). Reinforced on 6 May by Rear Admiral Aubrey W. Fitch's TF 11, Fletcher planned to meet the Japanese in the Coral Sea on 7 May, to stop the enemy thrust toward Port Moresby. On that day, each side attempted to strike blows with carrier aircraft; the Americans enjoying more success in that planes from Yorktown and Lexington sank . Japanese planes, attempting to strike the Americans, could not find them in the gathering darkness, and a twilight encounter between the returning Japanese air groups and American fighters robbed the enemy of experienced crews as well as virtually irreplaceable aircraft. Anderson, assigned to the Air Group (TG 17.5), operated in the screen of Lexington. The Japanese Striking Force, however, formed around and was, on 7 May, well south of Guadalcanal. The same day that American planes had dispatched Sh≈çh≈ç, planes from the enemy carriers sank Sims and damaged so severely that she had to be sunk later. The next morning some separated the two forces. The Americans struck first, crippling Sh≈çkaku; anti-aircraft fire and combat air patrol aircraft soon decimated Zuikakus air group. Meanwhile, the American carriers had taken divergent courses as the incoming Japanese strike neared them, Yorktown, Lexington, and their respective screens drawing three or four miles apart; Anderson continued to screen Lexington. About 1116 on 8 May, the first of the Japanese planes came in on the attack, which lasted until 1200. During the attack, Anderson maintained station on Lexington, constantly firing at the enemy, but scoring no hits. With the exception of one burst of machine gun fire, the destroyer was not attacked, the enemy concentrating his attack on Lexington. \\"Lady Lex\\" took two hits on the port side. Then, Aichi D3A \\"Val\\" dive bombers punctured her with near misses and staggered her with two direct hits. A bomb smashed into the port forward gun gallery, and another exploded inside the carrier's funnel. During the afternoon her fires were brought under control and her list corrected. But the explosions had ruptured her gasoline pipes, and about 1445 a series of explosions occurred, setting off internal fires. Anderson stood by to render assistance and pick up survivors as the big carrier was abandoned, and rescued 377 men. Eventually, had to sink Lexington with torpedoes. The first battle fought with neither side sighting the other except from the cockpits of their respective aircraft, the engagement in the Coral Sea stopped the Japanese thrust toward Port Moresby. It was a strategic victory for the Allies, but a tactical one for the enemy, since the Japanese had inflicted heavier damage on the American carriers. Besides the loss of Lexington, Yorktown had been badly damaged. On 10 May, Anderson transferred the 377 Lexington sailors to , and, the following day, put into Noum√©a, New Caledonia, where she transferred five torpedoes to Phelps, which had expended torpedoes in attempting to sink Lexington. She sailed thence to Tongatapu, where she rejoined TF 17. On 28 May, she reached Pearl Harbor. Her rest, however, was to prove short, for forces were needed to thwart a new Japanese thrust, this one directed at Midway Island to draw out the United States fleet in a decisive battle. Anderson sortied again with TF 17 on 30 May, again in the screen for Yorktown, which had been hastily repaired. =Battle of Midway= On 4 June, Japanese planes struck the island of Midway with little opposition, and returned to their carriers to re-arm for a second strike. Confusion on the Japanese side as to what forces they found themselves facing proved fatal, as the American air attack from Yorktown, Enterprise, and caught the enemy at a vulnerable moment. While torpedo planes from the three carriers successively drew off the combat air patrols, dive bombers from Yorktown and Enterprise wrought mortal damage on three of the four enemy carriers engaged. Planes from , the one enemy aircraft carrier that had escaped destruction that morning, soon sought out the Americans and located TF 17. Although decimated by TF 17's combat air patrol, \\"Val\\" dive bombers managed to score damaging hits on Yorktown, causing her to go dead in the water. Andersons gunners claimed two Japanese planes downed as they retired from the scene. Yorktown, however, was underway again two hours later, her fires put out and power restored, and commencing to launch fighters when a second attack wave, this time composed of Nakajima B5N \\"Kate\\" torpedo planes, showed up. In the developing melee, Anderson shot down one \\"Kate\\" before it had a chance to launch its torpedo, but others managed to penetrate the terrific barrage and drop their ordnance, scoring two hits on the carrier's port side amidships. Andersons gunners claimed one of the retiring planes with a direct hit. As Yorktown, mortally wounded, slowed to a halt for the second time that day, Anderson picked up Ensign Milton Tootle, IV, USNR, a pilot from Fighting Squadron 3 (VF-3) who had been shot down attacking a Japanese torpedo plane. The destroyer then closed Yorktown and picked up 203 more men. While TF 17 gathered Yorktowns men and then cleared the area, the ship remained stubbornly afloat. When it became evident that the carrier would not sink immediately and might be saved, Admiral Fletcher ordered a salvage party put on board. Under tow by and with a salvage party on board composed of volunteers from the various ship departments, Yorktown appeared to be on the threshold of salvage. The arrival of , however, changed all that, and the gallant carrier was torpedoed on 6 June, along with Hammann. The latter sank immediately; Yorktown lingered until the following morning when she, too, sank. Anderson returned to Pearl Harbor on 13 June. From 8‚Äì15 July she escorted to Midway, and from 22‚Äì27 July, she escorted to Palmyra Island and back to Pearl Harbor. =Guadalcanal= On 17 August, Anderson sortied from Pearl Harbor with TF 17, en route to the Solomons area, where she sighted and joined TF 61 on 29 August. Anderson was assigned as screen for Hornet in TG 61.2. The Battle of the Eastern Solomons, which had taken place on 24 August, had turned back a major Japanese attempt to recapture Guadalcanal. Enemy submarines, however, still lurked in the waters east of Guadalcanal. On 31 August, , in TG 61.1, was torpedoed and damaged, and forced to retire to Tongatapu. On 14 September, six transports carrying reinforcements and supplies for Guadalcanal departed Espiritu Santo, with the task groups formed around and Hornet in support. Enemy submarines, however, again made their deadly presence felt. On 15 September, the torpedoed Wasp. At that time, Anderson was screening Hornet, about six miles (10 km) northeast of Wasp. A few minutes later, torpedoes were spotted racing toward Hornet, which maneuvered to avoid them. They passed ahead, one smashing into and the other into . Anderson was ordered to stand by the damaged battleship, and escorted her to Tongatapu on 19 September. During the remainder of September 1942, Anderson escorted a Dutch convoy to Dumbea Bay, New Caledonia, then on 3 October sortied with TF 17 en route to launch an air attack against enemy vessels in the Buin-Faisi area. On 3 October, Anderson was detached to proceed to the rescue of a downed pilot. The pilot was not found, and since the task force was by that time too far away to enable her to rejoin before the mission was accomplished, she proceeded singly to Noum√©a. =Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands= She rejoined TF 17 on 8 October, and on 15 October, received orders to proceed north to the Guadalcanal area to strike enemy forces in order to relieve pressure there. Hornet launched strikes on 16 October, and on 24 October the force joined with TF 16 to form TF 61. On 26 October, the American ships engaged a numerically superior Japanese striking force in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. Contact between the two opposing forces, as at Coral Sea, was almost simultaneous. During the day planes from Enterprise and Hornet damaged two enemy carriers, a cruiser, and two destroyers. American ship casualties, however, were considerably heavier. At 1010 on that morning some 27 planes attacked Hornet. Anderson opened fire, scoring hits on two planes, and splashing one. One bomb hit Hornets flight deck, then a \\"Val\\" crashed the ship. A moment later two \\"Kates\\" swept in, launching torpedoes which hit the carrier's engineering spaces. As she slowed to a halt, she was hit by three more bombs and another \\"Val\\". During this melee, Anderson succeeded in downing another torpedo plane, scored hits on several others, and took one machine gun bullet hit causing a small crack and dent in her side plating amidships. At noon, attempted to take Hornet in tow, but at 1815, another flock of enemy dive-bombers and torpedo planes roared in to attack the crippled carrier. A veritable sitting duck, she took a torpedo and a bomb hit, and abandoned ship. Anderson moved in to pick up survivors, taking on board 247 men. was ordered to sink the hulk, and scored three torpedo hits, but Hornet remained stubbornly afloat. Anderson was ordered to finish the job and slammed six torpedoes into the target, but she still remained afloat. Anderson and Mustin shelled Hornet, but the arrival of Japanese destroyers on the horizon forced the two American destroyers to take a hurried a departure. On the morning of 27 October, Japanese destroyers performed the final rites for Hornet with four torpedoes. During the Japanese attack on Hornet, the Enterprise group over the horizon had not gone unscathed. was sunk inadvertently by torpedo from a Japanese submarine while rescuing a downed pilot; Enterprise suffered three bomb hits; was severely damaged by a suicider; and both and suffered minor damage from bomb hits. Although the American forces had suffered heavier damage, they had succeeded in stopping the Japanese thrust toward Guadalcanal. In November 1942, Anderson participated in further operations in the waters off Guadalcanal, screening a transport group landing troops in Lunga Roads and providing call fire during landings on 4 to 6 November, and screening Enterprise during strikes against enemy shipping at Guadalcanal on 13‚Äì14 November. From December 1942 to 23 January 1943, the ship operated with TF 16 out of Espiritu Santo on antisubmarine patrol and training. Between 23 January and 3 February, she escorted Task Unit 62.4.7 (TU 62.4.7), a merchant ship convoy, to Guadalcanal to unload, and returned to Espiritu Santo. While in the Solomons, she conducted a photographic reconnaissance and bombardment of enemy-held beaches on northern coast of Guadalcanal on 29 January in company with . Anderson, continued to operate out of the New Hebrides Islands on hunter-killer missions, and escort runs for a fueling rendezvous with TF 67 and TF 68 until 7 March 1943. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 22 March and received onward routing back to the United States. From 9 April to 8 June, she lay at San Francisco undergoing overhaul and repairs. Following an escort run to Pearl Harbor and back in June, Anderson departed San Francisco on 11 July with TG 96.1 en route to Kodiak, Alaska, arriving on 21 July. Joining TG 16.17 on 30 July, she participated in bombardments of Kiska on 2 and 15 August 1943. The ship remained in the Aleutians on patrol duty until 21 September, when she departed for Pearl Harbor. From 14 October to 1 November, Anderson lay at Wellington, New Zealand, staging with the transports for the next operation. With TF 53, she arrived at Tarawa Atoll on 19 November 1943. As a part of Fire Support Group No. 3, she took station off the eastern end of Betio on D-day, 20 November, and began conducting bombardments of assigned targets. Betio was captured by 24 November, but Anderson remained in the general area on radar picket patrol and rendered intermittent call fire until 29 November, when she departed for Pearl Harbor. =Battle of Kwajalein= By 21 December 1943, she was back in San Diego to escort the 4th Marine Division to Kwajalein. En route, Anderson was one of the units designated to conduct a diversionary strike at Wotje on 30 January 1944. As one of the leading destroyers she opened the bombardment at 0642 and began to maneuver to avoid enemy return fire. At 0646, a shell hit in her combat information center (CIC), killing the commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander John G. Tennent, III, two ensigns, and three enlisted men, and wounding 14 others. Her executive officer immediately assumed command and kept her firing until she could maneuver to seaward to act as antisubmarine screen until completion of the Wotje bombardment at noon. The next day, Anderson approached the objective islands of Roi and Namur, Kwajalein Atoll, and screened to seaward as the heavy units began the bombardment. On 1 February, while transferring her wounded, she struck an uncharted pinnacle and had to be towed to Pearl Harbor. Following the completion of repairs on 15 June, the destroyer sailed to the southwest Pacific. Following an escort run to Oro Bay, New Guinea, Anderson arrived off Cape Sansapor, New Guinea, on 1 August with TG 77.3. During the landing operations she operated on antisubmarine station between Amsterdam Island and Cape Opmarai, then conducted patrols off Woendi Harbor, and Cape Sunsapor until 25 August. During the Morotai landings on 15 September 1944, the ship rendered call fire and conducted patrols off White beach. =Battle of Leyte Gulf= On 12 October, Anderson departed Seeadler Harbor with TG 78.2 for the landing operations at Leyte Gulf. Arriving in the area on 20 October, she took up patrol during the initial assault and until she joined TG 77.2 on 25 October. This group was under enemy air attack and Anderson fired on several planes without results. On 1 November, enemy air attacks were intense. The ship scored hits on several planes, splashing one. At 1812 on that day, a Nakajima Ki-43 \\"Oscar\\" fighter crashed into the ship's port side, aft of the break in the deck. Anderson suffered 14 dead and 22 wounded. Two of the wounded later died. Departing Leyte on 3 November 1944 and steaming via Hollandia, Manus, and Majuro, Anderson arrived at Pearl Harbor on 29 November 1944. There she received orders to proceed to San Francisco, where she moored on 9 December to begin repairs. =Duty off Japan= On 11 May 1945, she arrived at Attu Island, Alaska where she was assigned to TG 92.2. Eight days later, Anderson took part in a bombardment of Suribachi Wan and a sweep in the Sea of Okhotsk. From 10‚Äì12 June, she participated in the bombardment of enemy shore installations on Matsuwa To, Kuril Islands, and another anti-shipping sweep in the Sea of Okhotsk. While the remainder of the task group entered that body of water to intercept an enemy convoy headed south from Paramushir from 23‚Äì25 June, Anderson, Hughes, and established a patrol east of the Kurils to thwart any attempt of the convoy to escape into the Pacific. From 15‚Äì22 July, Anderson conducted a patrol east of the Kurils, an anti-shipping sweep in the Sea of Okhotsk, and another bombardment of Suribachi Wan, Paramushiru To, Kuriles. Another sweep was made in the Sea of Okhotsk, coupled with another bombardment of Matsuwa To, Kuriles, on 11‚Äì12 August 1945. Anderson remained with the Northern Pacific Force for the remainder of the war, and departed Alaskan waters for Japan on 27 August. She reached Ominato, Japan, on 8 September, and supported the occupation of northern Honsh≈´ through 30 October. She departed Japanese waters on that date, bound for the United States, and arrived at San Diego on 1 December. She was earmarked for retention in an inactive status in view of the experimental tests to which she would be subjected. Two days after Christmas, she got underway for Hawaiian waters. =Post-War= Operation Crossroads Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 3 January 1946, Anderson was assigned to Joint Task Force 1 on 15 May, and was slated to be utilized in the tests of the atomic bomb at Bikini Atoll. She reached her ultimate destination on 30 May 1946. On 1 July 1946, the bomb used in Test \\"Able\\" Operation Crossroads sank Anderson in Bikini lagoon. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 September 1946. Awards Anderson was awarded ten battle stars for her service in World War II.

Early life and education Mary Leahy, known as May in her youth, was born 2 March 1901 at the family farm of Creeves, near Shanagolden, County Limerick. Her parents were John and Hannah Leahy (n√©e Cuddihy). It is believed she had an older brother and sister, a younger sister and two younger brothers. She attended the Dominican College, in Eccles Street, Dublin. After she left school, she was employed in Guineys & Co. on Talbot Street owned by Denis Guiney. Career She married Denis Guiney on 19 October 1938 in the St Mary's Pro- Cathedral, Dublin. Guiney became a partner in the business, with the couple overseeing the flourishing of their shop at 79-80 Talbot street. This success allowed them to purchase Clerys & Company on O'Connell Street after it went into receivership in 1941. After buying Clerys, they formed a new private limited company in August 1941. In an unusual move for the time, Guiney was a director of the company alongside her husband with no others sitting on the board at first. Despite the timing of their takeover, during World War II, she was noted as a 'keen businesswoman' with Clerys seeing an increase of 1,000% in turnover. The Guineys invested in Clerys, installing two restaurants, a ballroom, three bars, and 42 sales counters over the store's four floors. Many have credited Clerys with keeping numerous Irish small suppliers in business during the war, emergency and afterwards, and having a positive effect on the Irish economy more broadly. By 1967 the store had over 1,000 employees drawing in thousands of customers from throughout Ireland. Clerys became known for its sales which took place twice a year. During the first sale in 1941, O'Connell Street was blocked with traffic, and ¬£100,000 was taken in its first week. Owing to Guiney's strong religious belief, Clerys hosted many charity events, in particular for the elderly or isolated Dublin residents. Beginning in 1954, Clerys provided afternoon tea with entertainment for 100 older people. Denis Guiney died in 1967, and after contesting her husband's will, Guiney retained control of their business with 52% share and remaining chair of the board. Denis Guiney's nephew, Arthur Walls, took over the day-today running of the stores. Guiney nearly died in May 1974, when Guineys on Talbot Street was caught in Dublin and Monaghan bombings. Later life Over time, Guiney gave relatives positions as managers and directors, but continued to retain the controlling share in the business and resisted suggestions to sell the company or assets. Among the sales she refused, was a takeover bid from John Teeling in 1987, and a failed buyout in 1999 by the general manager, Tom Rea. She commented on the Teeling bid, stating \\"Why would I want to sell the best business and building in Ireland?\\" Until the age of 99, Guiney visited the shop and attended board meetings. She signed the company's annual accounts until 2004 at age 103, making her potentially the oldest company director in the Ireland or United Kingdom. Largely, Guiney was seen as not making the most of the opportunities which arose during the Irish boom economic years in the late 1990s. In 1999 she did sell her house on the Howth Road for ¬£4 million, the site of which was developed. In these later years, Guiney continued to resist changes within Clerys, which some think damaged the store and hindered its ability to garner new or younger customers. Following her death, her shares were redistributed to a number of the extended Guiney family. Guiney died in Beaumont Hospital on 23 August 2004. Following a funeral mass in St Anthony's Church, Clontarf, Guiney was buried alongside her husband and his first wife in Glasnevin Cemetery.

The longitude of the ascending node (‚òä or Œ©) is one of the orbital elements used to specify the orbit of an object in space. It is the angle from a specified reference direction, called the origin of longitude, to the direction of the ascending node, as measured in a specified reference plane.Parameters Describing Elliptical Orbits, web page, accessed May 17, 2007. The ascending node is the point where the orbit of the object passes through the plane of reference, as seen in the adjacent image. Commonly used reference planes and origins of longitude include: * For geocentric orbits, Earth's equatorial plane as the reference plane, and the First Point of Aries as the origin of longitude. In this case, the longitude is also called the right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN). The angle is measured eastwards (or, as seen from the north, counterclockwise) from the First Point of Aries to the node.Keplerian Elements Tutorial, amsat.org, accessed May 17, 2007. * For heliocentric orbits, the ecliptic as the reference plane, and the First Point of Aries as the origin of longitude.

In the case of a binary star known only from visual observations, it is not possible to tell which node is ascending and which is descending. In this case the orbital parameter which is recorded is simply labeled longitude of the node, Œ©, and represents the longitude of whichever node has a longitude between 0 and 180 degrees., chap. 17;, p. 72. Calculation from state vectors In astrodynamics, the longitude of the ascending node can be calculated from the specific relative angular momentum vector h as follows: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{n} &= \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{h} = (-h_y, h_x, 0)  \\\\Omega &= \\\\begin{cases} \\\\arccos { {n_x} \\\\over { \\\\mathbf{\\\\left n \\\\right }}}, &n;_y \\\\ge 0;  2\\\\pi-\\\\arccos { {n_x} \\\\over { \\\\mathbf{\\\\left n \\\\right }}}, &n;_y < 0\\\\. \\\\end{cases} \\\\end{align} Here, n=x, ny, nz> is a vector pointing towards the ascending node. The reference plane is assumed to be the xy-plane, and the origin of longitude is taken to be the positive x-axis. k is the unit vector (0, 0, 1), which is the normal vector to the xy reference plane. For non-inclined orbits (with inclination equal to zero), Œ© is undefined. For computation it is then, by convention, set equal to zero; that is, the ascending node is placed in the reference direction, which is equivalent to letting n point towards the positive x-axis.

Background Question P was approved by the voters of Baltimore, Maryland, U.S., in November 2002 and took effect in the 2004 election. The ballot initiative proposed \\"that the City Council consists of 14 members, each to be elected from a different district, and a Council President, to be elected Citywide.\\" Baltimore City had previously had six council districts, each electing three council members. These 18 members, plus one City Council President elected at-large made up the body's 19 seats, cut from 21 to 19 in 1967. Question P amended the City Charter, restructuring the Council into 14 single-member districts, and retained the provision for an at-large Council President to be elected to preside over the body and function as a 15th member in voting. In favor of Question P The effort to gather the 10,000 signatures required to put Question P on the ballot was spearheaded by Community and Labor United for Baltimore (CLUB), a grassroots coalition of community groups and labor unions. Members of CLUB included organizations such as the League of Women Voters, ‚Äîa national association for labor unions of public sector employees, and 's Baltimore chapter‚Äîa collection of local community organizations that advocate for low-income families and people living in poverty. Two members of the Maryland legislature from Baltimore City, Delegates Jill P. Carter and Curt Anderson, also supported Question P. Both Carter and Anderson did radio commercials that aired on Baltimore radio stations prior to the election. CLUB's position was that approving Question P would save City taxpayers money by eliminating redundant positions, increase the transparency and accountability of Council members, and make it easier for less-established candidates to get elected. Opposition to Question P Council members who opposed Question P attempted to add an alternative measure to the ballot, Question Q, which was worded very similarly and also proposed cutting the number of city council seats from 19 to 14, but the retained larger, multi- member districts. According to Baltimore Sun reporter Laura Vozzella, \\"Critics accused [council members] of trying to sabotage the coalition plan and save their $48,000-a-year part-time jobs, since the two measures [...] likely would have canceled each other out if both passed.\\" Outcome In late September 2002, a Court of Appeals judge ruled in favor of CLUB's lawsuit and removed Question Q from the ballot because Shiela Dixon had violated the City's Open Meetings Act (Maryland Rule 15-505) by holding a closed-door committee meeting in August 2002 without giving public notice as required by law. At the private meeting, Council decided to put Question Q on the ballot, which led to Question . Despite the disapproval of City Council President Sheila Dixon and Mayor Martin O'Malley, Question P passed with more than two thirds (67%) of the vote.

Lindholm is currently the national coach of the Swedish Curling Association. Many regard him as the best European skip ever, and his longtime team of the same 4 players as the best European team in curling history. Over his two-decade curling playing career, Lindholm won three world championships as a skip, winning in 1997, 2001 and 2004, and also being runner up in both 1998 and 2000. He is also a two-time European champion (1998 and 2001) and is a former world junior champion (). He had constant disappointment in his career though at the Olympics, where despite being one of the gold medal favorites in each of 1998, 2002, 2006 his team ended up medalless, coming closest in 2002 with a 4th-place finish. One thing he was known for was amazing success against and being the career nemesis of Kevin Martin, even running up a streak of 10 consecutive wins at one point which was broken in the semi finals of the 2002 Olympics. He also had an excellent record vs. the all-time great team of Randy Ferbey (David Nedohin throwing skip stones) in the 2000s.

Its design and concept are based on the Canadian CADPAT pattern. The pattern is formed of small rectangular pixels of color. In theory, it is a far more effective camouflage than standard uniform patterns because it mimics the dappled textures and rough boundaries found in natural settings. It is also known as the \\"digital pattern\\" or \\"digi-cammies\\" because of its micropattern (pixels) rather than the old macropattern (big blobs). The United States government has patented MARPAT, including specifics of its manufacture. By regulation, the pattern and items incorporating it, such as the MCCUU and ILBE backpack, are to be supplied by authorized manufacturers only and are not for general commercial sale, although imitations are available such as \\"Digital Woodland Camo\\" or \\"Digital Desert Camo\\". MARPAT was also chosen because it distinctively identifies its wearers as Marines to their adversaries, while simultaneously helping its wearers remain concealed. This was demonstrated by a Marine spokesman at the launch of MARPAT, who stated: \\"We want to be instantly recognized as a force to be reckoned with. We want them to see us coming a mile away in our new uniforms.\\" As such, the U.S. Marine Corps restricts use of the camouflage, preventing its use in most other divisions of the United States military with the exception of some elements of the U.S. Navy. Development A U.S. Marine showcasing the MCCUU in woodland MARPAT in 2001 MARPAT was designed by Timothy O'Neill, Anabela Dugas, Kenneth G. Henley, John Joseph Heisterman, Jr., Luisa DeMorais Santos, Gabriel R. Patricio, and Deirdre E. Townes. The concept of using miniature swatches of color as opposed to large splotches is not new. In World War II, German troops used various patterns similar to the current German Flecktarn, which involved similar small dabs of color on a uniform to provide camouflage. The Canadian Forces originally developed the pattern called CADPAT, on which MARPAT was based. Timothy O'Neill's USMC design team in charge of this process, initially with the assistance of Kenneth G. Henley and then John Joseph Heisterman, Jr. (both active duty U.S. Marine Scout Snipers), went through over 150 different camo patterns before selecting three samples that met their initial objectives. These were two versions of tigerstripe and an older design of Rhodesian Brushstroke. The influence of tigerstripe can still be seen in the final MARPAT. These three samples were then reconstructed using new shapes and unique color blends that would allow a more effective uniform in a great range of environments. The new patterns were then field tested in different environments, day and night, with night vision and various optics. MARPAT did exceptionally well in their wet uniform test when viewed with night vision while illuminated with IR, where normally patterns appear as a solid. The MARPAT patent lists U.S. Army research into fractal pattern camouflage as the basis for MARPAT. The MARPAT pattern was chosen in a run-off against seven other patterns at the USMC Scout Sniper Instructor School. Preliminary development of MARPAT began in April 2000, with field testing of the pattern and the MCCUU beginning in 2001. The patent for the MARPAT pattern was filed on 19 June 2001, whereas the patent for the MCCUU uniform was filed on 7 November 2001. Early prototypes of the MARPAT desert pattern from 2001 featured grey, whereas the finished product did not. The uniform made its official debut at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina on 17 January 2002. In February 2003, MARPAT-patterned helmet covers began to be produced.https://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsDocDetails.aspx?ident_number=212748%20 The replacement of the BDU and DCU by the MCCUU was completed on 1 October 2004, a year ahead of the original requirement date set in 2001 of 1 October 2005. The MARPAT uniform was officially fielded as standard issue to the recruits of 3rd BN Mike Company in late 2002 at MCRD San Diego; it continues to be the USMC's standard issue uniform pattern to date. In all, the MARPAT development process from concept to completion took 18 months, the fastest time for a U.S. military-developed camouflage pattern to be produced. Design and colors Different ratios and variations of colors were tested before final candidate patterns were actually printed to textile for field trials. A modified version of Vietnam War‚Äìera tiger stripe also made it to final trials but was eliminated due to MARPAT being superior in all environments. The purpose of the digitized pattern is to create visual \\"noise\\" and prevent the eye from identifying any visual templates. Thus, the pattern is intended to not register as any particular shape or pattern that could be distinguished.Kenneth G. Henley, \\"MARPAT - A Personal Tale - From one of the designers of the Marine Pattern camouflage\\", MilitaryMorons, Sept 2003 There were initially three MARPAT patterns tested: Woodland, Desert, and Urban. While keeping the rights for Urban, only the Woodland and Desert patterns were adopted by the Marine Corps for general issue, replacing the U.S. Woodland pattern and the U.S. Three-Color Desert pattern. Webbing and equipment worn with MARPAT Woodland and MARPAT Desert is produced in Coyote Brown, a mid-tone color common to both the woodland and desert patterns. Although a digital snow pattern has also been adopted on cold-weather training over-garments, this uses a different pattern from the Canadian company Hyperstealth.Snow Camouflage Uniform data sheet Authentic MARPAT material is distinguishable by a miniature \\"Eagle, Globe, and Anchor\\" emblem incorporated into the pattern above the letters \\"USMC\\", in both the woodland and desert patterns.Eagle, Globe and Anchor example, Magna Fabrics.

The United States Army used the same shapes in designing its Universal Camouflage Pattern, which uses a much paler three-color scheme of sage green, grey and sand for use on the Army Combat Uniform. After major questions about its effectiveness arose, the Army adopted the \\"Scorpion W2\\" Operational Camouflage Pattern in 2015, to be fully phased in by 2019. The United States Air Force has designed its own Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) using a standard tiger stripe pattern and slight variation on the color scheme of ACU, also designed to be phased out by the OCP uniform by 2021. The United States Navy announced approval for a digital \\"BDU-style\\" work uniform in late 2008. The Navy Working Uniform (NWU) was chosen by surveyed sailors for consistency and longer life, while the blue-grey-black Type I pattern was designed for aesthetic purposes rather than camouflage to disguise them at sea. In January 2010, the Navy began considering new Navy Working Uniform patterns modified from MARPAT, named Type II and Type III, desert and woodland respectively. The Woodland pattern was actually an earlier coloration of the MARPAT scheme, not adopted following USMC trials. These patterns are overall darker than their respective MARPAT progenitors, modified with different color shades, and addressed the fact that the blue and grey Type I pattern was not meant for a tactical environment (the Battle Dress Uniform in M81 woodland and Desert Camouflage Uniform were still used for this purpose until the Type II and III patterns were introduced). Backlash from Marines, including an objection from former Commandant Conway, led to restrictions when NAVADMIN 374/09 was released: Type II pattern to Naval Special Warfare personnel, while the NWU Type III is the standard shore working uniform for all Naval personnel effective 1 October 2019.

History Gerritsen Avenue without bike lanes Bikers on Gerritsen Avenue The beach just past the end of Gerritsen Avenue, called \\"The Point\\" by local residents The neighborhood is named for Wolphert Gerretse, a Dutch settler, who, in the early seventeenth century, built a house and mill on Gerritsen Creek, which is now part of the nearby Marine Park neighborhood.Cohen, Joyce. \\"If You're Thinking of Living In/Gerritsen Beach; Secluded Peninsula in South Brooklyn\\", The New York Times, March 3, 2002. Accessed November 11, 2007. \\"The area, named for Wolfert Gerritsen, a 17th- century settler, was mostly marshland until around 1920, when a company called Realty Associates began building summer homes.\\" The three-hundred-year-old mill was destroyed by fire in 1931. The famous Whitney family owned property by the mill and built a mansion. The Mansion had horse stables, servant quarters, a carriage house, and a private race track. The Mansion was knocked down in 1936 for the Marine Park Building Developments but the carriage house was still left standing. The Carriage house was converted into a private home that is still standing today. Until the early twentieth century, the area remained undeveloped except for a few squatters‚Äô bungalows clustered at the foot of Gerritsen Avenue. In 1920, Realty Associates, a speculative real- estate builder, began constructing a middle-class summer resort there. The southwestern section of Gerritsen‚Äôs meadow was soon covered to one-story bungalows with peaked roofs and no backyards. The popularity of this venture spurred further growth. Some bungalow-owners made them suitable for year-round habitation; others built two-story houses with backyards; and, within a decade, there were fifteen hundred houses in Gerritsen Beach. After WWII, there were apartments for returning veterans and their families. They were located on the opposite side of Gerritsen Avenue in what is now park land. They were demolished around 1955 after all the residents had relocated. Almost all homes in the Gerritsen Beach area were damaged and/or affected by seawater on October 29, 2012, from Hurricane Sandy due to its peninsula characteristics. Almost all of the residents did not leave the neighborhood before the flooding began. The flood waters reached a record 10‚Äì12 ft in some parts of the neighborhood. A bar from Deep Creek Marina, two miles away, floated into the neighborhood, with bottles and seating intact.\\"The Neighborhood News,\\" New York magazine, Nov. 19, 2012, p. 10 The damage was so severe that it led Mayor Michael Bloomberg to reclassify Gerritsen Beach as being in a Zone A flood zone. Geography Gerritsen Beach lies on a peninsula in the southeastern part of Brooklyn, south of the neighborhood of Marine Park and west of the eponymous park. It is bounded on the north by Midwood at Avenue U, to the east by Marine Park at Gerritsen Avenue, to the south by Plumb Beach and the Plumb Beach Channel, and to the west by Sheepshead Bay at Shell Bank Creek and Knapp Street. It is bisected, from west to east, by the Gotham Avenue Canal. The area north of the canal, known as the \\"new section\\" by local residents, has traditional city streets lined with stores, brick houses, and wide sidewalks. The area south of the canal (the \\"old section\\") is a popular spot for party and chartered fishing boat berths. The typical size of the land lots in the community are in the old section, in the new section, and on the waterfront. The streets in Gerritsen Beach are in alphabetical order (that is, Aster, Bevy, Celeste, Dictum, etc.). Community The neighborhood has a large Irish-Catholic presence in the community. A few long-standing residents of Irish descent refer to the community as being cois fharraige, which is an Irish language phrase meaning \\"by the sea\\". The remaining percentage of the population is predominantly of Scandinavian, Italian and German descent. The neighborhood is also famous for sporting a disproportionate amount of hate crimes against African Americans, garnering a new found reputation as a ‚Äúsundown town‚Äù within New York City. Education The neighborhood is the location of the New York City Department of Education's Public School 277, an elementary school known as the Gerritsen Beach School. Brooklyn Blue-Feather School, 2335 Gerritsen Ave. is for special-needs children operates in the former Resurrection school building. The Brooklyn Public Library's Gerritsen Beach branch is located at 2808 Gerritsen Avenue. The library has been operating since the 1950s, though it moved to its current location, a structure, in 1997. Recreation The Gerritsen Ballfields, consisting of three baseball fields, two athletic fields for soccer or football, and one Little League field, are located on the east side of Gerritsen Avenue, in addition to a \\"mini-airport\\" for motorized model airplanes located at Seba Avenue and Gerritsen Avenue. In 1993, this site benefited from a $192,000 renovation sponsored by Borough Council Member Herbert E. Berman. Also, recreational fishing is very popular with citizens of the community, as anglers are found fishing along the shore at the southern end of Gerritsen Avenue and along the adjacent shoreline of the Gerritsen Creek-Marine Park \\"salt marsh\\". The Gerritsen Creek estuary and the adjacent salt marsh is also a major spawning ground for various species of marine fish. Although riding quads is popular at this park, the activity is illegal everywhere in New York City and is destructive to the park's fragile ecosystem. Police and crime Gerritsen Beach is patrolled by the 61st Precinct of the NYPD, located at 2575 Coney Island Avenue. The 61st Precinct ranked 5th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. The 61st Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 88.2% between 1990 and 2018. The precinct reported 1 murder, 17 rapes, 150 robberies, 170 felony assaults, 169 burglaries, 584 grand larcenies, and 72 grand larcenies auto in 2018. Fire safety =New York City Fire Department= Gerritsen Beach is served by the New York City Fire Department (FDNY)'s Engine Co. 321/Foam 321/Brush Fire Unit 6, located at 2165 Gerritsen Avenue. =Volunteer Fire Department= Gerrittsen Beach Fire Department Vehicles The local Volunteer Fire Department (a.k.a. \\"the Vollies\\"), the last remaining volunteer fire department in Brooklyn, was organized in 1922 when Gerritsen Beach was a small summer-resort community. The name of the department is officially spelled Gerrittsen Beach Fire Department . In 1921, a damaging fire on Abbey Court demonstrated to the community that the city‚Äôs regular fire apparatus could not reach the beach in time to put out a fire. A mass meeting was called by the residents, and that resulted in the organization of the only volunteer fire department in Brooklyn. Before the city added water mains under Gerritsen Beach streets, the Volunteers had to handle fires at least three times a week. The danger posed to Gerritsen Beach residents by fire was especially acute because most families relied on oil stoves and kerosene lamps, and the water to fight fires had to be pumped from wells. The city did not build Engine Company 321's firehouse at Gerritsen Avenue and Avenue U until October 4, 1930. Members of the fire brigade, currently known as the Vollies, were, in earlier times, nicknamed \\"the Vamps\\". Members are not only trained to fight fires, but also to rescue people who are drowning and to assist in other medical emergencies. According to the Vollies 1976 anniversary booklet, the Vollies were approved by the New York State Department of Health as an Emergency Services Training Center. Although the community is now served by Engine Company 321, strong support for the \\"Vollies\\" continues. The following historical events involved the Gerritsen Beach volunteers in actions outside their own neighborhood: * The Vollies responded with medical aid to the victims of the jet airliner crash at 7th Avenue and Sterling Place, on December 16, 1960. * Just three days after the New York air disaster, on December 19, 1960, the Vollies responded to the city‚Äôs call for assistance in fighting a blaze aboard the aircraft carrier USS Constitution at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. * During heavy fog, the powerful beam of the department's Mack searchlight is used at Kennedy Airport when requested. * When there was a major oil fire in Mill Basin in 1962, the Vollies responded with foam to help put it out. * On 9/11 The Vollies assisted FDNY Battalion 33 by temporarily relocating their apparatus to the Firehouse of Engine 321 on Gerritsen Avenue and Avenue U when E321 responded to the WTC. Doing so allowed the Vollies to cover the response areas normally covered by E321 such as Marine Park and Sheepshead Bay while continuing to provide service to the residents of Gerritsen Beach. * During the blizzard of 2010, the department responded rapidly to Gerritsen Beach while the EMS system was heavily delayed. * During Hurricane Sandy the Gerrittsen Beach Fire Department assisted in evacuating and rescuing residents trapped by flood waters, In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy the department set up a relief center providing food, shelter, medical resources and agency support to its residents.

It was negotiated at the 1855 Walla Walla Council. A variant spelling is Palus. Today they are enrolled in the federally recognized Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation and some are also represented by the Colville Confederated Tribes.  Ethnography  The people are one of the Sahaptin-speaking groups of Native Americans living on the Columbia Plateau in eastern Washington, northeastern Oregon, and North Central Idaho: these included the Nez Perc√©, Cayuse, Walla Walla, Umatilla and the Yakima.. The people of the region lived in three main groups, the Upper, Middle, and Lower bands. Traditional lands included areas around waterways such as the Columbia, Snake and Palouse rivers. The ancestral people were nomadic, following food sources through the seasons. The Palus people gathered with other native peoples for activities such as food-gathering, hunting, fishing, feasting, trading, and celebrations that included dancing, sports and gambling. They lived near other groups including the Nez Perce, Wanapum, Walla Walla, Umatilla and Yakama peoples. The people were expert horsemen. The term Appaloosa is probably a derivation of the term \\"Palouse horse.\\" They bred the horses for their distinct markings. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, the United States Army captured and slaughtered hundreds of tribal horses to cripple the tribe during the Indian Wars.  History  In October 1805, Lewis and Clark met with the tribe, although most were away from the area for fall food-gathering and hunting. Lewis and Clark presented one of the expedition's silver peace medals to paramount Chief Kepowhan. The Diaries of the Corps of Discovery describe the people as a separate and distinct group from the Nez Perc√©. After Kepowhan, during the decades 1830', 1840', 1850, Wattaiwattaihowlis (Kepowhan's son and probably principal chief), Kahlotus (known also as Quelaptip and Talatuche, chief of the Upper Palouse), Soei (chief of the Middle Palouse), Nehtalekin (called also Hahtalekin the Elder), Tilcoax (chief of the Lower Palouse), Hinmahtutekekaikt alias ‚ÄúJames‚Äù (one among the first to be christianized, friend to Henry H. Spalding and Marcus Whitman, often associated to the Nimiipu band of Hollolsotetote), were the leaders until the Isaac I. Stevens Treaty in 1855, when the Palouse refused to take part but sent, as observers, Kahlotus (already a good friend to Marcus Whitman), Tilcoax (a war chief) and Slyotze; \\"Old\\" Hathalekin and Tilcoax led the Palouse warriors against the U.S. troops during the Cayuse's uprising in 1847-1848, defeating col. Cornelius Gilliam and his \\"Oregon Volunteers\\" on the Tucannon Creek (march 14th-15th 1848). In 1858 Tilcoax led again the Palouse warriors in the \\"Skitswish (Coeur d'Alene) War\\": in May 1858 the Palouses succeeded in taking possession of an herd of Army's horses, but, on September 8, 1858, their own herd of 800 horses was slaughtered by col. George Wright's soldiers, and they surrendered. Husishusis Kute, chief of the Wawawai Palouse, and \\"Young\\" Hathalekin (also known as Taktsoukt Jlppilp), war-chief, led a small Palouse band as allies of the last free Nimiipu of Heinmot Tooyalaket alias \\"Chief Joseph\\"; \\"Young\\" Hathalekin died fighting on august 9th 1877 at Big Hole; Husishusis Kute surrendered with Heinmot Tooyalaket on October 5, 1877.

Origins  The first naval aviation units in Russia were formed in 1912‚Äì1914 as a part of the Baltic Fleet and the Black Sea Fleet. During World War I, the hydroplane units were used in the Black Sea for conducting aircraft reconnaissance, bombing and firing at coastal and port installations and enemy ships, and destroying submarines and enemy aircraft on the airfields.  Civil War and Interwar Period  The regular Soviet naval aviation units were created in 1918. They participated in the Russian Civil War, cooperating with the ships and the army during the combats at Petrograd, on the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, the Volga, the Kama River, Northern Dvina and on the Lake Onega. The newborn Soviet Naval Air Force consisted of only 76 obsolete hydroplanes. Scanty and technically imperfect, it was mostly used for resupplying the ships and the army. In the second half of the 1920s, the Naval Aviation order of battle began to grow. It received new reconnaissance hydroplanes, bombers, and fighters. In the mid-1930s, the Soviets created the Naval Air Force in the Baltic Fleet, the Black Sea Fleet and the Soviet Pacific Fleet. The importance of naval aviation had grown significantly by 1938‚Äì1940, to become one of the main components of the Soviet Navy. By this time, the Soviets had created formations and units of the torpedo and bomb aviation. At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War, all of the fleets (except for the Pacific Fleet) had a total of 1,445 aircraft.  Second World War  The Morskaya Aviatsiya (Naval Aviation) was the Soviet Navy's air service during World War II. Such air units provided air support to the Voyenno-Morskoy Flot SSSR (Soviet Navy) in the theaters of operations in the Barents, Baltic and Black Seas and also to the Soviet Naval Detachment in the Sea of Okhotsk. Russian Navy Aviation managed all land, shore and vessel-based (tender seaplanes and catapult vessels) hydroplanes and aircraft, as well as flying boats. The air units also conducted land operations in support of the Red Army during landings and disembarkations and served in special wartime operations. Naval Aviation provided some air cover to Allied convoys bringing equipment to Soviet forces from North Sea to the Barents Sea and via the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Okhotsk. In particular, Naval Aviation was deployed in defense of Odessa (June‚ÄìOctober 1941), in operations in the Crimea and the Black Sea and carried out successful air strikes in the last stages of the conflict on the European and Pacific Fronts. During the war, Naval Aviation delivered an immense blow to the enemy in terms of sunken ships and crews‚Äîtwo and a half times more than any other unit of the Soviet Navy. Seventeen naval aviation units were honored with the title of the Soviet Guards, while 241 men were awarded with the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union (including five pilots twice). =Aviation divisions of the Red Navy= * 1st Guards Fighter Aviation Division VVS VMF * 2nd Torpedo Rananskaya Red Banner Aviation Division in the name of N.A.

Cold War  To attack surface ships at long ranges, the Soviet Navy was unique in deploying large numbers of bombers in a maritime role for use by Naval Aviation. The Kiev class of Soviet aircraft carriers was deployed in the late 1970s and carried up to 30 aircraft including Yak-38 VTOL fighters. The next class of Soviet aircraft carriers, named the Admiral Kuznetsov class, supported more conventional aircraft such as the Su-33 \\"Flanker-D\\" and the MiG-29 \\"Fulcrum\\". Land-based aircraft such as the Tupolev Tu-16 \\"Badger\\" and Tu-22M \\"Backfire\\" bombers were deployed with high-speed anti-ship missiles. Previously believed to be interceptors of NATO supply convoys traveling the sea lines of communication across the North Atlantic Ocean between Europe and North America, the primary role of these aircraft was to protect the Soviet mainland from attacks by U.S. carrier task forces. =Inventory= Soviet Naval Aviation in 1990: ;Ship based *80 strike fighters **80 Yakovlev Yak-38 *219 naval helicopters **113 Kamov Ka-25 **106 Kamov Ka-27 ;Shore based *140 bombers **125 Tupolev Tu-16 **15 Tupolev Tu-22 *195 attack aircraft **95 Sukhoi Su-17 **100 Sukhoi Su-24 *180 Anti-submarine warfare aircraft **50 Tupolev Tu-142 **40 Ilyushin Il-38 *65 reconnaissance aircraft **50 Tupolev Tu-16 **15 Antonov An-12 *45 electronic-warfare aircraft **10 Tupolev Tu-22 **20 Tupolev Tu-95 **15 Sukhoi Su-24 *90 seaplanes **90 Beriev Be-12 *118 anti-submarine warfare helicopters **118 Mil Mi-14 *40 refueling aircraft **Tupolev Tu-16 N and Z  References  External links *http://www.ww2.dk/new/navy/aviation%20divisions.htm - Naval aviation divisions *https://web.archive.org/web/20101128053719/http://orbat.com/site/history/historical/russia/navalaviation.html- Naval aviation order of battle *Norman Polmar, Guide to the Soviet Navy (Fifth Edition), United States Naval Institute, Naval Institute Press, 1991, , 9780870212413 (Chapter 8) Naval Aviation Category:Naval aviation services Category:Aviation in the Soviet Union ","title":"Soviet Naval Aviation"},{"id":"924929","text":"The French term ', literally translated, is \\"the Quebec State\\".

The film stars Kirk Douglas as Dr. Rolf Pedersen and Richard Harris as Knut Straud, along with Ulla Jacobsson as Anna Pedersen. It was filmed on location in Norway. Plot The Norwegian resistance sabotage the Vemork Norsk Hydro plant in the town of Rjukan in the county of Telemark, Norway, which the Nazis are using to produce heavy water, which could be used in the manufacture of an atomic bomb. Kirk Douglas plays Rolf Pedersen, a Norwegian physics professor, who, though originally content to wait out the war, is soon pulled into the struggle by local resistance leader Knut Straud (based on Knut Haukelid, portrayed by Richard Harris). They are both smuggled to Britain to have microfilmed plans of the hydroelectric plant examined, and then return to Norway to plan a commando raid. When a force of Royal Engineers, who were to carry it out, are all killed, Pedersen and Straud lead a small force of saboteurs into the plant. The raid is successful, but the Germans quickly repair the equipment. The Germans then plan to ship steel drums of heavy water to Germany. Pedersen and Straud sabotage a ferry carrying the drums and it sinks in the deepest part of a fjord. Besides this sequence, the raids (Operations Grouse, Freshman and Gunnerside) and the final attack are depicted in location filming, in which snowy Norwegian locations serve as a backdrop for the plot.

John Drummond wrote a novel based on the same story called But for These Men. Both books formed the basis of the screenplay. The film was originally announced in 1963. It was made by Benton Film Productions, a company of director Anthony Mann and producer S. Benjamin Fisz. Financing came from America's Allied Artists and Britain's J Arthur Rank Productions. Scenes early in the film when the main characters escape from occupied Norway were filmed around Poole and Hamworthy in Dorset with the former Channel Islands ship TSS Roebuck playing the role of the hijacked steamer. SF Ammonia was used to represent the train ferry SF Hydro in the final fjord scenes. The movie was originally called The Unknown Battle and was to have starred Stephen Boyd and Elke Sommer and be written by Ben Barzman. Later, Anthony Perkins was announced as star. Eventually Kirk Douglas signed as the lead. Cliff Robertson was mentioned as a possible co-star before Richard Harris came on board. \\"I hear they are spending five million dollars, so it's got to be spectacular and that means more fiction and less fact\\", said Haukelid during filming. Stephen Boyd later sued Mann for half a million dollars when funding for the initial project fell through in early 1964. \\"I missed out on four good roles and plenty of money when he signed me without financial backing and then dropped the project\\", said Boyd later. \\"He asked me again later but I'd made other commitments so Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris made it under another title.\\" Reception It was amongst the 15 most popular films at the British box office in 1966. Other versions Ray Mears made a documentary called The Real Heroes of Telemark. Despite mainly sticking to the factual evidence, some scenes in the documentary, like the film, were partly dramatised, focusing more on the survival skills involved in the operation. The same story was also covered in the 1948 Franco-Norwegian film Kampen om tungtvannet (La bataille de l'eau lourde ‚Äî \\"The battle for heavy water\\"). Quite faithful to the real events, it even had many of the original Norwegian commandos starring as themselves. In 2015, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation showed a TV series called Kampen om tungtvannet (also known as The Heavy Water War or The Saboteurs) based on the events.

It can reach a height of 10 m. The leaves are 6‚Äì10 cm long, smooth, oval, leathery, shiny and dark green above, yellowish-green below, with deep furrows for the leaf stem. The bark is dark reddish brown and smooth. The small, scented, cream-white flowers open in early summer, and are followed later by berries which start red and turn black when ripe. Sakaki is one of the common trees in the second layer of the evergreen oak forests. It is considered sacred to Japanese Shint≈ç faith, and is one of the classical offerings at Shint≈ç shrines. Uses Wands of Sakaki are used in Shinto ritual Sakaki wood is used for making utensils (especially combs), building materials, and fuel. It is commonly planted in gardens, parks, and shrines. Sakaki is considered a sacred tree in the Shinto religion, along with other evergreens such as and . Shinto shrines are traditionally encircled with consisting . In Shinto ritual offerings to the , branches of sakaki are decorated with paper streamers (shide) to make tamagushi. Linguistic background The Japanese word sakaki is written with the kanji character , which combines (ki, \\"tree; wood\\") and (kami, \\"spirit; god\\") to form the meaning \\"sacred tree; divine tree\\". The lexicographer Michael Carr notes: > In modern Japanese, sakaki is written with a doubly exceptional logograph. > It is an ideograph (in the proper sense of 'logograph representing an idea' > rather than loosely 'Chinese character; logograph') and is a kokuji > 'Japanese [not Chinese] logograph.' Ideograms and kokuji are two of the > rarest logographic types, each constituting a small percentage of a typical > written Japanese sample. First, the idea of sakaki is expressed with a > melding of boku or ki 'tree' and shin or kami 'god; divine, sacred' [of > Shinto ]; comparable to a graphic fusion of the word shinboku 'sacred tree.' > Second, the sakaki ideograph is a kokuji 'national [i.e., Japanese] > logograph' rather than a usual kanji 'Chinese logograph' borrowing. Kokuji > often denote Japanese plants and animals not native to China, and thus not > normally written with Chinese logographs. (1995:11) The kanji first appears in the (12th-century) Konjaku Monogatarish≈´, but two 8th-century transcriptions of the word sakaki are , meaning \\"sage tree\\" (Kojiki, tr. Chamberlain 1981:64 \\"pulling up by pulling its roots a true cleyera japonica with five hundred [branches] from the Heavenly Mount Kagu\\"), and , meaning \\"slope tree\\" (Nihon Shoki, tr. Aston 1896:42‚Äì43, \\"True Sakaki tree of the Heavenly Mt. Kagu\\"). Sakaki ( or ) is the title of Chapter 10 in The Tale of Genji (ca. 1021). It comes from this context. > \\"May I at least come up to the veranda?\\" he asked, starting up the stairs. > The evening moon burst forth and the figure she saw in its light was > handsome beyond describing. Not wishing to apologize for all the weeks of > neglect, he pushed a branch of the sacred tree in under the blinds. \\"With > heart unchanging as this evergreen, This sacred tree, I enter the sacred > gate.\\" She replied: \\"You err with your sacred tree and sacred gate. No > beckoning cedars stand before my house.\\" And he: \\"Thinking to find you here > with the holy maidens, I followed the scent of the leaf of the sacred tree.\\" > Though the scene did not encourage familiarity, he made bold to lean inside > the blinds. (tr. Seidensticker 1976:187) The etymology of the pronunciation sakaki is uncertain. With linguistic consensus that the -ki suffix denotes (\\"tree\\"), the two most probable etymologies are either sakae-ki (\\"evergreen tree\\"), from ; or saka-ki (\\"boundary tree\\"), from ‚Äì an older form of modern reading sakai, from the way that trees were often planted at a shrine's boundary line. Carr (1995:13) cites Japanese tradition and historical phonology to support the latter etymon. The Shogakukan Kokugo Dai Jiten Dictionary entry for this term also notes that the pitch accent for sakayu () ‚Äì the origin of modern sakae () ‚Äì is different than what would be expected, suggesting that may be the more likely derivation (Shogakukan 1988).

(retrieved 22 May 2011) The tribes' traditional territories in the Pacific Northwest once encompassed most of what is now known as eastern Washington state and extended into British Columbia, Idaho, and Oregon. Eight of these related bands are the names of rivers that flow off of the eastern slopes of the North Cascades or the Okanagon Highlands. Several of these rivers have small towns or communities where the rivers flow into the Columbia River. Beginning in the Southwest the rivers in order as you go north and then east are the: Wenatchee (Town of Wenatchee), Entiat (Town of Entiat), Chelan (Town of Chelan), Methow (Town of Methow, upstream of the confluence with the Columbia), Okanogan (Town of Okanogan, upstream of the Confluence), Nespelem (Tribal community of Nespelem, upstream of the confluence), Sanpoil (Tribal community of Sanpoil, on the Sanpoil arm of Lake Roosevelt), and Colville (Town of Colville, upstream of the confluence). The Arrow Lakes are upstream on the Columbia River a little ways above the border in British Columbia. The Moses Coulee, Moses-Columbia, is an Ice Age Canyon (coulee) just south of the Columbia River west of Coulee City on U.S. Highway 2. Not to be confused, Coulee City is located in the Grand Coulee, a similar and more famous Ice Age Canyon that lies east of the Moses Coulee. The Nez Perce are the descendants of Chief Joseph band which came from Northeast Oregon. As part of the conditions of surrender Chief Joseph and his band were not allowed to return to their home in Oregon and were eventually re-located to the Colville reservation after the so called \\"Flight of the Nez Perce\\" in 1877. The Nez Perce (not including the small group re-located to Colville) are located on the Nez Perce Indian Reservation in West central Idaho along the Clearwater River. In 1872, the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation was formed by executive order under President Ulysses S. Grant for the purpose of occupying the Colville Reservation. It was a large area encompassing a wide variety of habitats and resources.

She was the first actress in the Rumberas films in the 1940s and 1950s, in the Golden Age of Mexican cinema. Career Mar√≠a Antonieta Pons began her career as a dancer in Cuba in numerous theaters and night clubs. When she was 16, she met Spanish actor and film director Juan Orol, who became her partner in various dance competitions on the island. After becoming Orol's wife, he took her to Mexico so she could act in films. Mar√≠a Antonieta Pons debuted in the Cinema of Mexico in the film Siboney (1938). After her debut in this film, Maria Antonieta performed with Orol in international dance tours in the United States, particularly in New York and Chicago. Towards the end of 1943, Pons returned to film, invited by the producer Guillermo Calderon to act in the film Noches de ronda, along with the actors Susana Guizar and Ramon Armengod. In the same year, she performed in the film Red Konga beside Pedro Armend√°riz. Eventually, Pons returned to Orol's films with Cruel destino. While still an employee of Orol, Pons began shooting other films with other directors. Highlights from these films are ¬°Viva mi desgracia! (1944), with Pedro Infante; Balaj√∫ (1944), along with Katy Jurado; and Rosalinda (1945), with Rafael Baled√≥n, among others. Her last film with Orol was Pasiones tormentosas (1946). After her break with Orol, Pons was hired by film producer Gregorio Wallerstein. Under the guidance of Wallerstein, she filmed movies like La reina del tr√≥pico (1946); La vida √≠ntima de Marco Antonio y Cleopatra (1946), with the Argentine actor Luis Sandrini and directed by Roberto Gavald√≥n; La sin ventura (1947); √Ångel o demonio (1947) and The Well-paid (1948), among others. In 1949, she performed in the second film version of La mujer del puerto (the first version was realized by the actress Andrea Palma in 1934), directed by Tito Davison. Pons met her second husband, the actor and director Ram√≥n Pereda in 1950, when he contracted her to film El cicl√≥n del Car√≠be. Pons and Pereda married soon after. With Pereda as director, Pons made films like La reina del mambo (1950), Mar√≠a Cristina (1950), La ni√±a popoff (1952) and Casa de perdici√≥n (1954), among others. In 1952 she joined the Brazilian market with the film Carnaval Atl√°ntida In the 1950s, she had famous film collaborations with Evangelina Elizondo in ¬°Que bravas son las coste√±as! (1955); Antonio Espino Clavillazo in Nunca me hagan eso (1956); and with Germ√°n Vald√©s \\"Tin Tan\\" in Teatro del cr√≠men (1956), Las mil y una noches (1957), La Odal√≠sca no. 13 (1957), and Una estrella y dos estrellados (1959). Pons began alternating performances in films with performances in major theaters in Mexico City, like The Margo (today Blanquita) or the Follies Bergere. With the decline of the Rumberas films, Pons retired from the cinema in the early sixties. Her last film was Ca√±a brava (1965), alongside the singer Javier Sol√≠s. =Retirement= After Ca√±a Brava, Pons's public appearances were limited. Speculation regarding the location of her residence appeared: Los Angeles, Miami, and New York have been proposed.SOMOS (1999), p. 13 Starting in the 1970s, she refused to have contact with the public. When her husband Ramon Pereda died, her isolation was higher. She even refused to receive a Diosa de Plata Award. Her reason was: All that can be said of me, was reflected in my films.SOMOS (1999), p. 24 After the death of Ramon Pereda she remarried in 1989, this time to Benjamin Alvarez. Death Mar√≠a Antonieta Pons died in Mexico City on 20 August 2004. Pons had started to have mental lapses, but her death was caused by a heart attack. At her request, her death was announced after the funeral services had concluded. In several interviews, her widower denied that Pons was overweight, and held that she kept the statuesque figure that characterized her in her films. She is survived by her only daughter, Maria Guadalupe Pereda, from her second marriage.

Origin The whirlpool is caused by local bathymetry and extreme tidal range where waters exchange between Passamaquoddy Bay and the Bay of Fundy, combined with the unusual topography of the location's sea floor at the confluence of the numerous local currents. The whirlpools form in an area with a diameter of approximately , as determined by the president of the Old Sow Whirlpool Survivors' Association in 1997 by way of an aerial photograph. The photograph was calibrated using the Deer Island Point Light beacon tower of known width that was included in the photograph. Old Sow is one of five significant whirlpools worldwide (Corryvreckan, Scotland; Saltstraumen, Norway; Moskstraumen, Norway; and the Naruto whirlpools, Japan are the others). Although the tidal currents within Western Passage surrounding Old Sow compare with faster whirlpools elsewhere, the speed of Old Sow's vortex is considerably slower than the Moskstraumen, the world's most powerful whirlpool. Tremendous water turbulence occurs locally in the greater Old Sow area, but it does not usually constitute a navigation hazard for motorized vessels with experienced operators at the helm; however, small craft‚Äîespecially vessels with keels (sailboats) and human-powered vessels‚Äîare warned to avoid these waters when the tide is running. Besides Old Sow and its numerous \\"piglets\\" (small and medium whirlpools surrounding Old Sow), other area phenomena include standing waves, upwellings (that on rare occasion may even spout several feet into the air), and deep or more, circular and trench- shaped depressions in the water. The failed Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project/\\"Quoddy Dam\\" Project saw a series of tidal dikes constructed during the 1930s to connect Moose Island (Eastport, Maine) to Carlow Island (in Eastport), Carlow Island to Pleasant Point and to connect Treat Island (in Eastport) to Dudley Island (in Lubec, Maine). The changes in local water flow from the dikes reportedly reduced predictability of the \\"funnel\\" effect of Old Sow.

Loosely based on Nakazawa's own experiences as a Hiroshima survivor, the series begins in 1945 in and around Hiroshima, Japan, where the six-year-old boy Gen Nakaoka lives with his family. After Hiroshima is destroyed by atomic bombing, Gen and other survivors are left to deal with the aftermath. It ran in several magazines, including Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump, from 1973 to 1987. It was subsequently adapted into three live action film adaptations directed by Tengo Yamada, which were released between 1976 and 1980. Madhouse released two anime films, one in 1983 and one in 1986. In 2007, a live action television drama series adaptation aired in Japan on Fuji TV over two nights, August 10 and 11. Publication history Cartoonist Keiji Nakazawa created the feature Ore wa Mita (translated into English as I Saw It), an eyewitness account of the atomic- bomb devastation in Japan, in the monthly manga Monthly Sh≈çnen Jump in 1972. In the United States it was published through Educomics in 1982.Barefoot Gen a.k.a. Gen of Hiroshima at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on August 3, 2016. Nakazawa went on to serialize the longer, autobiographical Hadashi No Gen (Barefoot Gen) beginning in the June 4, 1973 edition of Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump manga magazine, It was cancelled after a year and a half, and moved to three other less widely distributed magazines: Shimin (Citizen), Bunka Hy≈çron (Cultural Criticism), and Ky≈çiku Hy≈çron (Educational Criticism). It was published in book collections in Japan beginning in 1975. Plot The story begins in Hiroshima during the final months of World War II. Six-year-old Gen Nakaoka and his family live in poverty and struggle to make ends meet. Gen's father Daikichi urges them to \\"live like wheat,\\" which always grows strong despite being trod on. Daikichi is critical of the war. When he shows up drunk to a mandatory combat drill and talks back to his instructor, the Nakaokas are branded as traitors and become subject to harassment and discrimination by their neighbors. To restore his family's honor, Gen's older brother Koji joins the Navy against Daikichi's wishes, where he is subjected to a brutal training regimen by his commanding officer and lost one friend who killed himself because of this. On August 6, the atomic bomb is dropped on Hiroshima. Gen's father and siblings perish in the fires, but he and his mother escape. The shock causes her to give premature birth; Gen's new sister is named Tomoko. In the days following the attack, Gen and his mother witness the horrors wrought by the bomb. Hiroshima lies in ruins, and the city is full of people dead and dying from severe burns and radiation sickness. Gen meets a girl named Natsue, whose face has been severely burned. She attempts to commit suicide, but Gen convinces her to continue living. Gen and his mother adopt an orphan named Ryuta, who by sheer coincidence looks identical to Gen's deceased younger brother Shinji. After Gen returns to their burnt-out home and retrieves the remains of his father and siblings, he and his family go to live with Kime's friend Kiyo. However, Kiyo's crotchety mother-in-law conspires with her grandchildren to drive the Nakaokas out. Gen looks for work to pay the family's rent. A man hires him to look after his brother Seiji, who has been burnt from head to toe and lives in squalor. Though Seiji is reluctant at first, he warms up to Gen over time: The boy learns Seiji is an artist who has lost the will to live because his burns have left him unable to hold a brush. With Gen's help, Seiji learns to paint with his teeth but, eventually, he dies of his wounds. On August 14, Emperor Hirohito announces Japan's surrender over the radio, ending the war. Following Japan's unconditional surrender, American occupation forces arrive to help the nation rebuild. Gen and Ryuta, fearing rumours they've heard about the Americans, arm themselves with a pistol they find in an abandoned weapons cache. They learn the Americans aren't as bad as they'd thought when they're given free candy, but they also witness a group of American soldiers harvesting organs from corpses for medical research. Kiyo's mother-in-law evicts the Nakaokas after Gen gets into a fight with her grandchildren, and they move into an abandoned bomb shelter. Gen and Ryuta attempt to earn money to feed Tomoko, getting involved with the local Yakuza. After the Yakuza betray them, Ryuta kills one of them with the pistol they found and becomes a fugitive. Later, Gen learns that Tomoko has been kidnapped. He finds her with the help of a classmate, only to learn that she's become ill. Tomoko dies soon after. In December 1947, Gen is reunited with Ryuta, who has become a juvenile delinquent, doing odd jobs for the Yakuza. He meets Katsuko, a girl scarred by burns from the bomb. As an orphan and a hibakusha, she is subject to discrimination and cannot go to school; Gen lends her his books and teaches her himself. Themes Major themes throughout the work are power, hegemony, resistance and loyalty. Gen's family suffers as all families do in war. They must conduct themselves as proper members of society, as all Japanese are instructed in paying tribute to the Emperor. But because of a belief that their involvement in the war is due to the greed of the rich ruling class, Gen's father rejects the military propaganda and the family comes to be treated as traitors. Gen's family struggles with their bond of loyalty to each other and to a government that is willing to send teenagers on suicide missions in battle. This push and pull relationship is seen many times as Gen is ridiculed in school, mimicking his father's views on Japan's role in the war, and then is subsequently punished by his father for spouting things he learned through rote brainwashing in school. Many of these themes are put into a much harsher perspective when portrayed alongside themes of the struggle between war and peace. , author of believes that the characters Katsuko and Natsue coopt but change the stereotypical \\"Hiroshima Maiden\\" story, as typified in Black Rain, as although courageous, Katsuko and Natsue are severely scarred both physically and mentally. \\\\- Article translated by Nele Noppe. - Original Japanese article, Translations A volunteer pacifist organization, Project Gen, formed in Tokyo in 1976 to produce English translations. Leonard Rifas' EduComics (together with World Color Press) published it that same year as Gen of Hiroshima, the \\"first full-length translation of a manga from Japanese into English to be published in the West.\\" It was unpopular, and the series was cancelled after two volumes. The group Rondo Gen published an Esperanto translation as Nudpieda Gen (Barefoot Gen) in 1982. The chief translator was Izumi Yukio.

He was one of the most inventive, influential, and popular composers of the time, probably second only to Monteverdi in northern Italy. Life Grandi was born in Venice and spent the first part of his life there, likely studying with Giovanni Gabrieli. He held several posts in Ferrara as maestro di cappella at different cathedrals and academies. In 1617 he won a post at St. Mark's in Venice, during the time Monteverdi was choirmaster there. Eventually he became Monteverdi's assistant, and during this time seems to have chosen to write works in some of the smaller forms which Monteverdi was neglecting. In 1627 he went to Bergamo, probably because he had an opportunity to be maestro di cappella at a place where he could build up the music program from scratch. Most likely he met Heinrich Sch√ºtz on that composer's second visit to Italy. Unfortunately, after only three years at Bergamo, Grandi died in 1630 during an outbreak of the plague. Works Most of Grandi's music is vocal with instrumental accompaniment. Stylistically, his early music is similar to that of Giovanni Gabrieli, with alternating short passages of greatly contrasting rhythms and texture; however he usually wrote for smaller forces. Most of Grandi's early compositions are motets in the concertato style: some are duets and trios, an innovation in motet writing, which usually involved larger groups. Grandi was one of the few composers who continued to write involved vocal polyphony over the basso continuo right after its introduction‚Äîmost composers using the continuo in the first decades of the 17th century wrote monodies, or preferred more homophonic textures. Grandi experimented with extreme emotionalism in some of his music, with chromaticism, ornament, and affectation. While harmonically he was not as adventurous as Gesualdo, he was connected to the larger tradition, and thus his works were almost as influential as Monteverdi's. He ceaselessly innovated, writing monodies with instruments such as violins, and in a sectional form with repeating parts for instruments only‚Äîan idea which would develop into the ritornello. The music of Grandi shows a link between the concertato style which began the Baroque era, and the form of the cantata which culminated in the work of J.S. Bach. Grandi was one of the most popular composers of his day; his works were published throughout Italy, Germany, and the Low Countries, and continued to be reprinted long after his death. He wrote motets, psalm settings, madrigals, as well as some of the earliest compositions to be called \\"cantata.\\" References  Further reading  *Manfred Bukofzer, Music in the Baroque Era.

In March 2012, The New American Haggadah, edited by him and translated by Nathan Englander, was released to mixed reviews. In 2009, Foer published his third book, Eating Animals. A New York Times bestseller, Eating Animals provides a morally dense discussion of some of the ramifications that followed the proliferation of factory farms.

The book offers a significant focus on \\"storytelling\\"‚Äïthe title of both the first and the last chapters of the book. Storytelling is Foer's way of recognizing and dealing with the complexity of the subject that is eating animals, and suggests that, ultimately, our food choices tell stories about who we are, or, as Foer has it in his book, \\"stories about food are stories about us‚Äïour history and our values.\\" In May 2012, Foer signed a two-book deal with Little, Brown.

Overview The Corcoran School, founded in 1878, hosts exhibitions by its students and visiting artists and offers degrees in Fine Art, Photojournalism, Interaction Design, Interior Architecture, etc. Prior to the Gallery's closing, it was one of the oldest privately supported cultural institutions in the United States. Starting in 1890, a museum school, later known as the Corcoran College of Art + Design, co-existed with the gallery. The museum's main focus was American art. In 2014, after decades of financial problems and mismanagement, the Corcoran was dissolved by court order. A new non-profit was established and the Corcoran's $2 billion, 17,000 piece art collection was given away for free to the National Gallery of Art (NGA). What works the NGA did not accession were donated to cultural institutions throughout Washington, D.C. and across the United States. The Corcoran School of Art and Design was given to George Washington University (GWU) along with the $200 million historic 17th Street building and $50 million. History =Founding= Entrance of the former Corcoran Gallery of Art When the gallery was founded in 1869 by William Wilson Corcoran, the cofounder of Riggs Bank, it was one of the first fine art galleries in the country. Corcoran established the gallery, supported with an endowment, \\"for the perpetual establishment and encouragement of the Fine Arts.\\" While an independent institution, the Corcoran was the oldest and largest non-federal art museum in the District of Columbia. Its mission was \\"dedicated to art and used solely for the purpose of encouraging the American genius.\\" The Corcoran Gallery of Art was originally located at 17th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, in the building that now houses the Renwick Gallery. Construction of that building started before the Civil War. The building, near completion, was used by the government as a warehouse during the Civil War. It was finally completed in 1874 and the gallery opened to the public. By 1897, the Corcoran Gallery collection outgrew the space of its original building. A new building was constructed, designed by Ernest Flagg in a Beaux-Arts style. The 135,000 square feet (12,500 m2) building was built to house an expanded Corcoran collection in addition to the nascent school, which had been formally founded in 1890. The new building features a pair of bronze statues, the Canova Lions, at its entrance. These lions were purchased at auction by the Corcoran Gallery in 1888 and placed in front of the museum at its original location. The iconic bronze castings were moved to their current location in 1897 when the museum moved to its current building at 17th Street and New York Avenue. = Years of growth = In 1928, the art collection of former Senator William A. Clark joined the Corcoran in a new wing designed by Charles Adam Platt, and inaugurated by President Calvin Coolidge. For decades, the Corcoran examined the possibility of adding on a final wing which would complete the campus footprint. These plans abruptly ended in 2005 after a Frank O. Gehry -designed wing was scrapped due to lack of funding, and the remainder of the available property was sold to a private developer. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, the gallery continued to display its main collection from Corcoran, Clark, and a few select major donors. At its peak, the museum owned a significant collection including work from Rembrandt Peale, Eug√®ne Delacroix, Edgar Degas, Thomas Gainsborough, John Singer Sargent, Claude Monet, Mariano Fortuny, Pablo Picasso, Edward Hopper, Willem de Kooning, Joan Mitchell, Gene Davis, and many others. Space was always a challenge - only a small percentage of the gallery's permanent collection was able to be displayed in the confines of the 17th Street gallery, which shared its roughly with the art school. = Mapplethorpe controversy = In 1989, the Corcoran Gallery of Art had agreed to host a traveling solo exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe's works. Mapplethorpe decided to show a new series that he had explored shortly before his death, Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment curated by Janet Kardon of the Institute of Contemporary Art. Several Trustees of the Corcoran and U.S. Representatives Dick Armey (TX) and Jesse Helms (NC) were horrified when the works were revealed to them, and the museum director, Christina Orr-Cahall succumbed to pressure and cancelled the exhibit, which had already been announced to its members through an exhibition preview invitation. The Coalition of Washington Artists organized a demonstration to protest the Corcoran Gallery's cancellation of the exhibit. An estimated 700 people attended the demonstration. In June 1989, pop artist Lowell Blair Nesbitt became involved in the controversy over Mapplethorpe's work. It was at this time that Nesbitt, a long-time friend of Mapplethorpe, revealed that he had a $1.5 million bequest to the museum in his will. Nesbitt publicly promised that if the museum refused to host the exhibition he would revoke his bequest. The Corcoran refused and Nesbitt bequeathed the money to the Phillips Collection instead. After the Corcoran cancelled the Mapplethorpe exhibition, the underwriters of the exhibition went to the nonprofit Washington Project for the Arts, which showed the controversial images in its own space from July 21 to August 13, 1989, to large crowds. The 1990 NEA Appropriations Bill included language against \\"obscene\\" work. As a result of the controversy, more than a dozen artists canceled exhibitions while the director, Christina Orr- Cahall, resigned and moved to the Norton Museum of Art. = Final years = By 2018, artwork accessioned by the National Gallery of Art from the Corcoran collection had been incorporated into displays at the Gallery; these four paintings are among those currently visible in the rooms dedicated to American art. In its final years, the museum and its affiliated art and design college Corcoran School of the Arts and Design together had a staff of about 140 and an operating budget of about $24 million. Revenue came from grants and contributions, admissions fees, tuition, membership dues, gift shop and restaurant sales, and an endowment worth around $30 million. In February 2001, two AOL executives (Robert W. Pittman and Barry Schuler) and their wives donated $30 million to the museum, its largest single donation since its founding. In 2014, following decades of financial problems, the Corcoran Trustees chose to break the founder's deed of trust by going to court to have the Corcoran dissolved. Following a court order dissolving the city's oldest independent museum, the trustees gave the former college of art and design, the $200 million Beaux Arts building, and $50 million to George Washington University to renovate the facility and operate the school programs. The 17,000 piece art collection worth $2 billion was donated to the National Gallery of Art. In the beginning of 2018, the director of the Corcoran School of the Arts and Design officially disclosed plans for the National Gallery of Art to bring art back to the second floor of the Flagg building.  Interior  Flagg also designed the interior of the building. When one enters the building's front doors on 17th Street, they first enter the atrium. The vast space, separated into three connected sections, consists of forty limestone columns and twin skylights (to light the intended display of sculptures). The Beaux-Arts-inspired room rises two interior stories and has housed exhibit space and other uses.National Register of Historic Places nomination Directly across the atrium from the front entrance stands the grand staircase, leading to the second floor. Low rise stairs, wide, are watched over by six statues on pedestals atop marble platforms, and lead to a landing halfway to the second floor. Hold onto the brass-topped railing for balance. From the grand staircase, one can access the rotunda and the second story level of the atrium, including a bridge that heads across the atrium back towards the direction of the front door. Gallery space exists throughout. Back on the first floor, three galleries lead from the atrium (originally there were seven). The second floor originally had eight galleries. The rotunda came later, designed by Charles Platt in 1925. Forty eight feet wide, the room's domed ceiling culminates in an oculus skylight. Reminiscent of the Pantheon, the space offers an exquisite entry to the building's Clark Wing. An observer would access a marble-floored, square, dark staircase hall with wood panels to reach the Clark Wing galleries. At the northern end of the building, the Hemicycle's unusual shape fills the angle created by New York Avenue and 17th Street. The space is the auditorium, being with a 300-person capacity. The Salon Dor√© appears on the building's opposite side. Also referred to as the \\"French Room,\\" it displays intricate French decorations; it was designed in the early 1700s by Jean‚ÄêFran√ßois‚ÄêTh√©r√®se Chalgrin and was moved from Paris to the United States sometime before 1904. In 2015, preservationists added the interior portions of the Corcoran Gallery to the National Register of Historic Places (the exterior had been listed in 1971). The interior nomination includes the grand staircase, atrium, rotunda, gallery, and other notable spaces.

Narco-state (also narco-capitalism or narco-economy) is a political and economic term applied to countries where all legitimate institutions become penetrated by the power and wealth of the illegal drug trade. The term was first used to describe Bolivia following the 1980 coup of Luis Garc√≠a Meza which was seen to be primarily financed with the help of narcotics traffickers. Examples of some narco-states are described below. Other well- known examples are Mexico, Colombia, and Guinea-Bissau, where drug cartels produce, ship and sell drugs such as cocaine and marijuana. The term is often seen as ambiguous because of the differentiation between narco-states. The overall description would consist out of illegal organisations that either produce, ship or sell drugs and hold a grip on the legitimate institutions through force, bribe or blackmail. This situation can arise in different forms. For instance, Colombia, where drug lord Pablo Escobar ran the Medell√≠n Cartel (named after his birthplace) during most of the 1970s and 1980s, producing and trafficking cocaine to the United States of America. Escobar managed to take over control of most of the police forces in Medell√≠n and surrounding areas due to bribery, allowing him to expand his drug trafficking business. Nowadays scholars argue that the term ‚Äúnarco-state‚Äù is oversimplified because of the underlying networks running the drug trafficking organisations. For example, the Guadalajara cartel in Mexico, led by Miguel √Ångel F√©lix Gallardo, who managed to combine several small drug trafficking families into one overarching cartel controlling the Marijuana production in the rural areas of Mexico while trafficking Colombian cocaine to the U.S.A at the same time. Over time the cocaine market expanded to Europe, leading to new routes being discovered from Colombia through Brazil or Venezuela and Western Africa. These new routes proved to be more profitable and successful than shipping from North-America and turned African states such as Nigeria, Ghana and (later on) Guinea-Bissau into actual narco-states. While cocaine was transported through Western Africa, the Taliban produced opium in the rural areas of Afghanistan using the revenues to fund their guerrilla war. Despite American and NATO efforts to impose laws on the Afghan opium production, the early 2000s incumbent Afghan governments shielded the opium trade from foreign policies as much as possible. Ongoing discussions divide scholars into separate groups either claiming or disclaiming the resemblance between narco- states and failed states. Depending on which properties are assigned to the definition of a failed state, the definition is in accordance with the narco- state. While most narco-states show signs of high rates of corruption, violence and murder, properties that are also assigned to failed states, it is not always clear if violence can be traced back to drug trafficking. Obvious to say is that failed states are not consequently narco-states, but uncertain is whether all narco-states are also failed states.  Usage  It has been argued that narco-states can be divided into five categories depending on their level of dependence on the narcotics trade and the threat the narcotics trade in said country poses to domestic and international stability. These five categories are (in ascending order): incipient, developing, serious, critical, and advanced. However, recent use of the term narco-state has been questioned by some for being too widely and uncritically applied, particularly following the widespread media attention given to Guinea-Bissau as \\"the world's first narco-state\\" in 2008, and should instead refer only to those countries in which the narcotics trade is state-sponsored and constitutes the majority of a country's overall GDP. Examples = Guinea-Bissau = Guinea-Bissau, in West Africa, has been called a narco-state due to government officials often being bribed by traffickers to ignore the illegal trade.Washington Post newspaper: Guinea-Bissau coup: Prime minister arrested for helping drug trade, military says 13 April 2012 \\"Analysts told the AP that in Guinea-Bissau, traffickers have bought off members of the government and military, turning the country into a 'narcostate.'\\" Colombian drug cartels used the West African coast as Jamaica and Panama increased policing. The Guardian noted Guinea-Bissau's lack of prisons, few police, and poverty attracted the traffickers. An article in Foreign Policy questioned the effectiveness of money from the United States, the European Union, and the United Nations designated to combat the illegal trade. = Honduras = Honduras has been labeled as a narco-state due to drug trafficking involvement of president Juan Orlando Hern√°ndez and his brother Tony Hern√°ndez, who was a congressman. Tony Hern√°ndez was captured in 2018 in the United States and was accused of conspiracy of cocaine trafficking to the US in 2019. Also Fabio Lobo, who is the son of former president Porfirio Lobo was arrested by DEA agents in Haiti in 2015. All of them are members of the conservative right- wing National Party of Honduras. = Mexico = Corruption within the Mexican government has been a problem within Mexico for decades. The Mexican cartels have been known to be quite influential within Mexican politics, going so far as to pump large sums of money into Mexican electoral campaigns, supporting candidates sensitive to bribery in order to keep their businesses safe. As far back as the early 20th century, drug trafficking had been tolerated by the Mexican government. Since 1929, the dominant party of Mexico, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) forged ties with various groups in order to gain political influence. Among them were the drug traffickers. The ties between the PRI and the drug lords became so close that the PRI even went so far as to have an alliance with the drug traffickers and sanctioned their activities. During the 1980s and 1990s the drug scene in Mexico accelerated. Before the 1980s most of Mexico's drug production yielded marijuana and small bits of heroin. Cocaine mostly reached the U.S.A. through the Bahamas and the Caribbean. After the U.S.A. shut down the routes that entered the state from Florida, Colombian drug cartels established a partnership with Mexican traffickers and cartels, finding new routes smuggling cocaine over land into North-America. A few small Mexican cartels merged into the Guadalajara cartel, led by Miguel √Ångel F√©lix Gallardo, increasing the volumes of marijuana production and drug trafficking. The Guadalajara cartel trafficked the cocaine produced by the Colombian Cal√≠ cartel, while expanding the marijuana production in the rural areas of Mexico at the same time. The U.S.A. established a special force, named the Drug Enforcement Administration (D.E.A.), to fight the war on drugs within their own borders and beyond. The D.E.A. office situated in Mexico received extra resources to investigate the murder of one of their own; Enrique \\"Kiki\\" Camarena, who was abducted, tortured and murdered by a state police officer paid by members of the cartel. These insights confirmed the corruption rate that grasped Mexico during the 1980s and 1990s. Although, not only police officers on payroll obeyed to Miguel √Ångel F√©lix Gallardo and his cartel. Investigations show transactions to high officers in federal government, such as the Federal Directorate of Security and the Mexican Federal Judicial Police. The beginning of the Mexican Drug War in 2006 was the first time any significant government effort took place to fight the drug cartels in Mexico and was initiated by Mexico's newly elected president, Felipe Calder√≥n. Calder√≥n's predecessor, Vicente Fox, who was elected in 2000, marked the first time Mexico had a president who was not from the PRI. However, despite Calder√≥n's efforts, the PRI was returned to power in 2012 with the election of Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. During the court hearing for the most wanted cartel leader, Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n, it was alleged that former president Enrique Pe√±a Nieto had accepted a $100 million bribe from the drug kingpin. On 1 December 2018, Mexico elected a new president, Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador (AMLO). Despite presenting himself as being non-established, AMLO was a member of the PRI from 1976 to 1989. = Suriname = Suriname has been labeled as a narco-state due to President D√©si Bouterse and his family involvement in drug trafficking. Bouterse was sentenced in absentia in the Netherlands to 11 years' imprisonment after being convicted of trafficking of cocaine. His son Dino Bouterse has been arrested twice in three different countries and currently serving 16 years imprisonment in the United States on charge of drug trafficking. = Syria = Syria was labeled as a narco-state by the United States for nearly a decade until 1997, during the Syrian occupation of Lebanon when they controlled the cannabis cultivation in the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon. During the Syrian Civil War, several shipments containing tonnes of amphetamines were seized in different countries smuggled from Syria, those shipments had sometimes millions of pills of Fenethylline which is also known as Captagon. = United Kingdom = The United Kingdom has been called the first narco-state: thanks to the Opium Wars, the UK became a powerful force in the traffic of illegal drugs in the mid to late 19th century. = United States = = Venezuela = More recently, Venezuela has been labeled a narco-state, due to the relations between some Venezuelan government officials to drug cartels and criminal factions all across Latin America. For example, former vice president of Venezuela Tareck el Aissami has been accused of supporting drug trafficking and helping Mexican drug cartels. El Aissami has been sanctioned by the United States since 2017. The nephews and sons of Venezuela's president Nicolas Maduro are also being accused of financing drug trades and being involved in the Narcosobrinos affair. In November 2017, the United States's UN ambassador Nikki Haley accused Venezuela of being a \\"dangerous narco-state\\".

Early years Ram√≥n L√≥pez-Irizarry, born in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, was a professor of agricultural sciences at the University of Puerto Rico. In the late 1940s, the Government of Puerto Rico gave a grant to the University of Puerto Rico to assist in the development of Puerto Rican industries.ProQuest Historical Newspapers Coco L√≥pez In 1949, L√≥pez-Irizarry, with the use of some of these funds, was able to work in his laboratory on an idea that he had. L√≥pez- Irizarry set out to find an easier way to extract the cream from the coconut pulp. The heart of the coconut has always been an important ingredient in many of the desserts in Puerto Rico. The main problem was extracting the coconut cream from the pulp which was a difficult task. L√≥pez-Irizarry discovered an easier way by blending the cream from the hearts of the Caribbean coconuts with an exact proportion of natural cane sugar. He named the product which he developed Coco L√≥pez. L√≥pez-Irizarry kept the ingredients of the product a secret. The project was so successful that L√≥pez-Irizarry soon left the University and commercialized it. Coco L√≥pez became the basis for the famous pi√±a colada drink, which made its first appearance in 1954. The pi√±a colada is also known as the \\"Official Beverage of Puerto Rico\\".Coco L√≥pez Later years L√≥pez-Irizarry was very successful. He packaged his product at the Industrias La Famosa canning factory, owned by Wilbert Parkhurst and family, for years. In 1966, he sold the brand to the Parkhurst family who later forged a deal with David Ballachow to distribute the product in the United States.Slammed Magazine Eventually the Parkhurst family sold the brand to the Borden company. L√≥pez-Irizarry's Coco L√≥pez can be found in supermarkets worldwide. Personal life L√≥pez-Irizarry was married to Georgina Ram√≠rez- Banuchi and had four children: Rosabel, Myrna, Ram√≥n and Jorge.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 62, based on 13 reviews. AllMusic's Heather Phares praised the band for displaying their idiosyncratic sludge rock with gusto and charm throughout the color-filled track list, concluding that the band's \\"major-label-level exposure is almost as refreshing as its noisy weirdness.\\" Tom Moon of Rolling Stone praised the album for utilizing the punk blues formula set by The White Stripes and adding their own take on it, concluding that the result is \\"the kinetic rush of vintage punk minus the self-conscious nostalgia, the discipline of pop songcraft with, thankfully, no sugar added.\\" Jason Jackowiak of Splendid was mixed about the album, saying that there were great ideas heard throughout but were brought down by the instruments taking away the songs' melody, concluding that \\"Any hopes that their label boss/producer might plug in and inject some six-string vitality into the humdrum proceeding are dashed to bits as \\"Grey\\" fizzles out in a tempest of gargling mini-moog.\\" Cam Lindsay of No Ripcord was also intrigued by the band's approach to their music with the color-coded track list but was put off by the instrumentation being overly idiosyncratic and stripping the melody away from the songs, saying that \\"for those who have difficulty trusting the hype, Do Rabbits Wonder? is just too much of a silly mess to really enjoy.\\" Pitchforks Eric Carr heavily panned the album, criticizing the band for being similar to Devo but with misused vocals and instruments that become incoherent arrangements that are hard to listen to, concluding that, \\"If nothing else can be said in its favor, this is music that will instantly, violently polarize people: some folks' inner masochists may welcome it as an alternative to self-flagellation; personally, I'd rather take sandpaper across my corneas than sit through this thing again.\\" He also singled out Jack White, V2 and Rolling Stones promotion of the band for the album's creation.

The locality is best known for the solar temple of King Nyuserre Ini, the largest and best preserved solar temple, as well as the solar temple of Userkaf, both built in the 25th century BCE during the Old Kingdom Period. Evidence suggests that as many as six solar temples were constructed during the 5th Dynasty, however, only the two temples previously mentioned (Nyussere's and Userkaf's) have been excavated. Abu Gorab is also the site of an Early Dynastic burial ground dating back to the First Dynasty. Early dynastic cemetery North of Nyuserre's sun temple is a cemetery dating back to the First Dynasty of Egypt (c. 3100-2900 BCE), where people belonging to the middle ranks of the Ancient Egyptian society were buried. The area was primarily used as a burial site during the 5th dynasty and became nearly obsolete as a necropolis after the 5th dynasty. Sun temple of Nyuserre Ini left The Sun Temple of Nyuserre was excavated by Egyptologists Ludwig Borchardt and Friedrich Willhelm von Bissing sometime between 1898 and 1901, on behalf of the Berlin Museum. The sun temple is situated near Memphis, and is closely linked with the Abusir necropolis, both geographically and functionally. The temple was constructed on the orders of Nyuserre Ini, sixth king of the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt. The exact dates of his reign are unknown but it is estimated that he came to the throne early in the second half of the 25th century BCE. Nyuserre also built a pyramid complex in what was then the royal necropolis, to the south of Abu Gorab in Abusir. The temple was probably constructed late during Nyuserre's reign. It was built in honor of the Egyptian Sun god Ra and named (Ssp-ib-R‚Äô) meaning ‚ÄúRe‚Äôs Favorite Place‚Äù or \\"Joy of Re.\\" The temple consists of a rectangular walled enclosure, 100 by 76 meters with an entrance situated on the eastern face. The complex is primarily built out of mudbrick covered with limestone, and is situated on the shores of the ancient Abusir lake bed. The main temple was built on a natural hill that had been enhanced. Artificial terraces on this hill were created, which then served as the foundation for the temple. Entrance to the temple is gained through a small structure called the Valley Temple, on the eastern edge of the complex. It is partially submerged and has suffered extensive damage. It is known that an entrance corridor ran from the portico through the building and led to a causeway on the opposite side. Altar at Solar Temple of NyuserreInside the temple is a large, open courtyard. At the western end of the courtyard lie the ruins of a colossal stone obelisk. The obelisk's had a pedestal red-granite base, sloping sides, and a square top. The obelisk itself, however, was constructed out of irregularly shaped limestone blocks. Estimates of the combined height of the obelisk and base vary, although the obelisk was most likely between thirty-five and fifty meters tall. An altar is located in the center of the courtyard, near the eastern face of the obelisk. It was constructed from five large blocks of alabaster, which are arranged to form a symbol that has been translated as \\"May Ra be satisfied\\". Records recovered from Userkaf's sun temple, suggest that two oxen and two geese were sacrificed each day. On the North side of the courtyard are the remains of several storerooms, which may have been where the sacrificial animals were slaughtered. left Along the east wall of the courtyard are a set of nine circular alabaster basins. It has been theorized that there were originally ten basins. Some scholars believe these basins were used to collect blood from animal sacrifice. To support this hypothesis, they point to evidence of grooves cut into the stone floor of the courtyard that may have been used to drain away the blood. Other researchers, however, think that the basins were probably only symbolic, or decorative, since no knives or other equipment related to sacrifice have been discovered in the area. It has also been hypothesized that these basins were used as leveling devices for large areas, linked together and filled with water to provide a common point of reference. Further examination, however, is required to determine the exact role of the alabaster bins. A large, 30 x 10 m brick built sun barque buried in a mud- brick chamber was excavated to the south of the temple.Fowling with a dragnet, agricultural scene, and handling ducks. Wall fragment from the Sun Temple of Nyuserre Ini at Abu Gorab, Egypt. c. 2430 BCE. Neues Museum, Berlin In the covered corridor, on the east and southern edges of the temple, there were carved reliefs along the interior walls. The passageway was decorated with relief scenes depicting the sed-festival, an important Ancient Egyptian ritual of renewal. These carvings highlight Re's beneficent attitude towards Nyuserre's reign through episodes of the sed-festival. Such depictions, in fact, represent the most detailed display of this theme from the Old Kingdom. Similar sed-festival scenes also appear in the chapel towards the southern edge of the chapel. Additionally, in the short passageway connecting to the obelisk platform from the south, known as the Room of the Seasons, are detailed painted reliefs in limestone depicting two of the three Egyptian seasons, akhet (inundation) and shemu (harvest). The reliefs from the Room of the Seasons essentially illustrate the sun's life-giving and sustaining role in nature, particularly during the spring and summer seasons. Accompanying these seasonal scenes are illustrations of seasonal activities (i.e. netting fish, trapping birds, making papyrus boats, and phases of the agricultural cycle). The vast illustrations of animal and plant life as well as human engagement with nature may be some of the earliest extensive corpus of such scenes. The artwork was likely commissioned by King Nyuserre himself. Although, the reliefs do not reflect typical royal funerary decoration scene during The Old Kingdom, and although skillfully designed, they are not as carefully executed as similar carvings from the 4th and early 5th dynasties. The image to the right shows a fragmented relief from the temple. The carving portrays Egyptians trapping birds in a clap net. The clap net itself is missing, but six men are shown in the lower register holding the rope that will pull the net shut. In the upper right register, two figures are shown caging two birds that have already been caught, while in the upper left corner, a cow and her calf make up the remnants of a much larger animal husbandry scene. Nearly all reliefs at the site were removed, mostly to German collections, and many perished during World War II. Unfortunately as a result, today nearly all reliefs have been either destroyed or severely fragmented. Other ruins The German archaeological expedition under the direction of Friedrich Wilhelm von Bissing uncovered the ruins of large buildings of mudbricks beneath the sun temple of Nyuserre in Abu Gorab. It is possible that these represent the remains of the sun temple of Neferefre, called Ra Hotep, \\"Ra's offering table\\", although this is still conjectural.

The screened entrance court faces the Place du Palais-Royal, opposite the Louvre. In 1830 the larger inner courtyard of the palace, the Cour d'Honneur, was enclosed to the north by what was probably the most famous of Paris's covered arcades, the Galerie d'Orl√©ans. Demolished in the 1930s, its flanking rows of columns still stand between the Cour d'Honneur and the popular Palais-Royal Gardens. The Palais-Royal now serves as the seat of the Ministry of Culture, the Conseil d'√âtat and the Constitutional Council. History =Palais-Cardinal= The Palais-Cardinal, circa 1641 Originally called the Palais-Cardinal, the palace was the personal residence of Cardinal Richelieu. The architect Jacques Lemercier began his design in 1629; construction commenced in 1633 and was completed in 1639. Upon Richelieu's death in 1642 the palace became the property of the King and acquired the new name Palais-Royal. After Louis XIII died the following year, it became the home of the Queen Mother Anne of Austria and her young sons Louis XIV and Philippe, duc d'Anjou, along with her advisor Cardinal Mazarin. From 1649, the palace was the residence of the exiled Henrietta Maria and Henrietta Anne Stuart, wife and daughter of the deposed King Charles I of England. The two had escaped England in the midst of the English Civil War and were sheltered by Henrietta Maria's nephew, King Louis XIV. =House of Orl√©ans= Henrietta Anne was later married to Louis' younger brother, Philippe de France, duc d'Orl√©ans in the palace chapel on 31 March 1661. The following year the new duchesse d'Orl√©ans gave birth to a daughter, Marie Louise d'Orl√©ans, inside the palace. After their marriage, the palace became the main residence of the House of Orl√©ans.Philippe de France, duc d'Orl√©ans the younger brother of Louis XIV. The Duchess created the ornamental gardens of the palace, which were said to be among the most beautiful in Paris. Under the new ducal couple, the Palais-Royal would become the social center of the capital. The court gatherings at the Palais-Royal were famed all around the capital as well as all of France. It was at these parties that the cr√®me de la cr√®me of French society came to see and be seen. Guests included the main members of the royal family like the Queen Mother, Anne of Austria; the duchesse de Montpensier, the Princes de Cond√© and de Conti. Philippe's favourites were also frequent visitors. The palace was redecorated and new apartments were created for the Duchess's maids and staff. Several of the women who later came to be favourites to King Louis XIV were from her household: Louise de La Valli√®re, who gave birth there to two sons of the king, in 1663 and 1665; Fran√ßoise-Ath√©na√Øs, marquise de Montespan, who supplanted Louise; and Ang√©lique de Fontanges, who was in service to the second Duchess of Orl√©ans. After Henrietta Anne died in 1670 the Duke took a second wife, the Princess Palatine, who preferred to live in the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Cloud. Saint-Cloud thus became the main residence of her eldest son and the heir to the House of Orl√©ans, Philippe Charles d'Orl√©ans known as the duc de Chartres.Brother to the Sun king:Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans by Nancy Nicholas Barker =Palais Brion= The House of Orl√©ans did not occupy the northeast wing, where Anne of Austria had originally lived, but instead chose to reside in the palais Brion to the west of the main block, where the future regent, before his father died, commissioned Gilles-Marie Oppenord to decorate the grand appartement in the light and lively style R√©gence that foreshadowed the Rococo. These, and the Regent's more intimate petits appartements, as well as a gallery painted with Virgilian subjects by Coypel, were all demolished in 1784, for the installation of the Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais, now the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. The palais Brion, a separate pavilion standing along rue Richelieu, to the west of the Palais-Royal, had been purchased by Louis XIV from the heirs of Cardinal Richelieu. Louis had it connected to the Palais-Royal. It was at the palais Brion that Louis had his mistress Louise de La Valli√®re stay while his affair with Madame de Montespan was still an official secret. Later on, the royal collection of antiquities was installed at the palais Brion, under the care of the art critic and official court historian Andr√© F√©libien, who had been appointed in 1673. =Fran√ßoise Marie de Bourbon, Duchess of Orl√©ans= General site plan by Fran√ßois d'Orbay, 1692 In 1692, on the occasion of the marriage of the duc de Chartres to Fran√ßoise Marie de Bourbon, Mademoiselle de Blois, a legitimised daughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, the King deeded the Palais-Royal to his brother. For the convenience of the bride, new apartments were built and furnished in the wing facing east on the rue de Richelieu. It was at this time that Philippe commissioned the gallery for his famous Orleans Collection of paintings, which was easily accessible to the public. The architect was Jules Hardouin-Mansart,Rudeck 2010. and the cost of this reconstruction was totaled to be 400,000 livres.Nancy Nicholas Barker, Brother to the Sun King:Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans.

Nancy Freeman-Mitford When the Duke of Orl√©ans died in 1701, his son became the head of the House of Orl√©ans. The new Duke and Duchess of Orl√©ans took up residence at the Palais-Royal. Two of their daughters, Charlotte Agla√© d'Orl√©ans, later the Duchess of Modena, and Louise Diane d'Orl√©ans, later the Princess of Conti, were born there. La R√©gence and the reign of Louis XV map of Turgot, 1739. The palace itself fronts on its small square. At the death of Louis XIV in 1715, his five-year-old great-grandson succeeded him. The Duke of Orl√©ans became Regent for the young Louis XV, setting up the country's government at the Palais-Royal, while the young king lived at the nearby Tuileries Palace. The Palais-Royal housed the magnificent Orl√©ans art collection of some 500 paintings, which was arranged for public viewing until it was sold abroad in 1791. After the Regency, the social life of the palace became much more subdued. Louis XV moved the court back to Versailles and Paris was again ignored. The same happened with the Palais-Royal; Louis d'Orl√©ans, who succeeded his father as the new Duke of Orl√©ans, and his son Louis Philippe lived at the other family residence in Saint-Cloud, which had been empty since the death of the Princess Palatine in 1722. The Palais-Royal was soon the scene of the notorious debaucheries of Louise Henriette de Bourbon who was married to Louis Philippe in 1743. New apartments (located in what is now the northern section of the Rue-de-Valois wing) were added for her in the early 1750s by the architect Pierre Contant d'Ivry.Ayers 2004, p. 47. She died at the age of thirty-two in 1759. She was the mother of Louis Philippe II d'Orl√©ans, later known as Philippe √âgalit√©. The Palais under the stewardship of Louis Philippe II A few years after the death of Louise Henriette, her husband secretly married his mistress, the witty marquise de Montesson, and the couple lived at the Ch√¢teau de Sainte-Assise where he died in 1785. Just before his death, he completed the sale of the Ch√¢teau de Saint- Cloud to Queen Marie Antoinette. Louis Philippe II d'Orl√©ans succeeded his father as the head of the House of Orl√©ans. He was born at Saint-Cloud and later moved to the Palais-Royal and lived there with his wife, the wealthy Louise Marie Ad√©la√Øde de Bourbon whom he had married in 1769. The couple's eldest son, Louis-Philippe III d'Orl√©ans, was born there in 1773. Louis Philippe II, who controlled the Palais-Royal from 1780 onward, expanded and redesigned the complex of buildings and the gardens of the palace between 1781 and 1784. In 1780, he decided to commercialise the residence by letting out the area under the colonnades to retailers and service-providers and in 1784, the gardens and surrounding structures of the Palais-Royal opened to the public as a shopping and entertainment complex. Though the corps de logis remained the private Orl√©ans seat, the arcades surrounding its public gardens had 145 boutiques, caf√©s, salons, hair salons, bookshops, museums, and countless refreshment kiosks. These retail outlets sold luxury goods such as fine jewelry, furs, paintings and furniture to the wealthy elite. Stores were fitted with long glass windows which allowed the emerging middle-classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies. Thus, the Palais-Royal became one of the first of the new style of shopping arcades and became a popular venue for the wealthy to congregate, socialise and enjoy their leisure time. The redesigned palace complex became one of the most important marketplaces in Paris. It was frequented by the aristocracy, the middle classes, and the lower orders. It had a reputation as being a site of sophisticated conversation (revolving around the salons, caf√©s, and bookshops)], shameless debauchery (it was a favorite haunt of local prostitutes), as well as a hotbed of Freemasonic activity. Byrne-Paquet, L., The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping, ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp 90-93 =Shopping arcade= Over a decade or so, sections of the Palais were transformed into shopping arcades that became the centre of 18th-century Parisian social, economic and social life. Mitchell, I., Tradition and Innovation in English Retailing, 1700 to 1850, Routledge, Oxon, p. 140 Inspired by the souks of Arabia, the Galerie de Bois, a series of wooden shops linking the ends of the Palais Royal, was first opened in 1786. Conlin, J., Tales of Two Cities: Paris, London and the Birth of the Modern City, Atlantic Books, 2013, Chapter 2; Willsher, K., \\"Paris's Galeries de Bois, Prototype of the Modern Shopping Centre,\\" [A history of cities in 50 buildings, day 6], 30 March, 2015 For Parisians, who lived in the virtual absence of pavements, the streets were dangerous and dirty; the arcade was a welcome addition to the streetscape as it afforded a safe place where Parisians could window shop and socialise. Thus, the Palais-Royal began what architectural historian describes as l‚Äô√àre des passages couverts (the Arcade Era), which transformed European shopping habits between 1786 and 1935.Lemoine, B., Les Passages Couverts, Paris: D√©l√©gation √† l'action artistique de la ville de Paris [AAVP], 1990. . Designed to attract the genteel middle class, the Palais-Royal sold luxury goods at relatively high prices. However, prices were never a deterrent, as these new arcades came to be the place to shop and to be seen. Arcades offered shoppers the promise of an enclosed space away from the chaos that characterised the noisy, dirty streets; a warm, dry space away from the elements; and a safe-haven where people could socialise and spend their leisure time. Promenading in the arcades became a popular eighteenth century pastime for the emerging middle classes. Byrne-Paquet, L., The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping, ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 90‚Äì93; Mitchell, I., Tradition and Innovation in English Retailing, 1700 to 1850, Routledge, Oxon, p. 140 Galeries de bois at the Palais-Royal, by Theodor Josef Hubert Hoffbauer, lithograph, c. 1825 Within a decade, new arcades were opened at the Palais site, and it was transformed into a complex of gardens, shops and entertainment venues situated on the external perimeter of the grounds, under the original colonnades. The area boasted some 145 boutiques, caf√©s, salons, hair salons, bookshops, museums, and numerous refreshment kiosks as well as two theatres. The retail outlets specialised in luxury goods such as fine jewellery, furs, paintings and furniture designed to appeal to the wealthy elite. Retailers operating out of the Palais complex were among the first in Europe to adopt fixed prices and thereby spare their clients the hassle of bartering. Stores were fitted with long glass exterior windows (at the time shop glazing was virtually unknown in Paris), which allowed the emerging middle classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices. Thus, the Palais-Royal became one of the first examples of a new style of shopping arcade, frequented by both the aristocracy and the middle classes. By day the galleries, bookshops, salons, caf√©s, and restaurants were an important gathering place for the aristocracy, intellectuals, students and financiers. By night, it became the haunt of libertines, off-duty soldiers and prostitutes, many of whom rented apartments in the building.Byrne-Paquet, L., The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping, ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, pp. 90‚Äì93 In addition, charlatans, gambling houses, ventriloquists, pimps, and prostitutes held court on the doorstep of the royal palace.

It was built from 1637 to 1641 to designs by Lemercier and was initially known as the Great Hall of the Palais-Cardinal. This theatre was later used by the troupe of Moli√®re beginning in 1660, by which time it had become known as the Th√©√¢tre du Palais-Royal. After Moli√®re's death in 1673 the theatre was taken over by Jean-Baptiste Lully, who used it for his Acad√©mie Royale de Musique (the official name of the Paris Opera at that time).Clark 1998, pp. 1‚Äì2, 19‚Äì20. 1780 plan of the Palais-Royal with Moreau's opera house (1770‚Äì1781) The Opera's theatre was destroyed by fire in 1763, but was rebuilt to the designs of architect Pierre-Louis Moreau Desproux on a site slightly further to the east (where the rue de Valois is located today) and reopened in 1770. This second theatre continued to be used by the Opera until 1781, when it was also destroyed by fire, but this time it was not rebuilt. Moreau Desproux also designed the adjacent surviving entrance facades of the Palais- Royal.Pitou 1983, vol. 1, pp. 13, 26‚Äì30; Ayers 2004, pp. 47‚Äì48. Today's Th√©√¢tre du Palais-Royal, originally designed by Victor Louis in 1784 with fire escapes added by Paul S√©dille in 1880 At the request of Louis Philippe II, two new theatres were constructed in the Palais-Royal complex shortly thereafter. Both of these new theatres were designed by Victor Louis, the architect who also designed the garden galleries for the complex. The first theatre, which opened on 23 October 1784, was a small puppet theatre in the northwest corner of the gardens at the intersection of the Galerie de Montpensier and the Galerie de Beaujolais.Hemmings 1994, p. 37; Wild 2003; for the opening date see the entry \\"Beaujolais (th√©√¢tre des)\\" in Lecomte 1905, p. 15. Initially it was known as the Th√©√¢tre des Beaujolais, then as the Th√©√¢tre Montansier, after which Victor Louis enlarged it for the performance of plays and operas. Later, beginning with the political turmoil of the Revolution, this theatre was known by a variety of other names. It was converted to a caf√© with shows in 1812, but reopened as a theatre in 1831, when it acquired the name Th√©√¢tre du Palais-Royal, by which it is still known today.Wild 2003; Ayers 2004, pp. 47‚Äì48; see also the first entry for \\"Vari√©t√©s (th√©√¢tre des)\\" in Lecomte 1905, p. 55, and the entry \\"Palais-Royal (2e th√©√¢tre du)\\" on p 47. The Salle Richelieu, designed and constructed 1786‚Äì1790 by Victor Louis, became the theatre of the in 1799. Palais-Royal (c. 1790) with Victor Louis' second theatre and the rue de Valois replacing Moreau's opera Louis Philippe II's second theatre was larger and located near the southwest corner of the complex, on the rue de Richelieu. He originally intended it for the Opera, but that company refused to move into it. Instead he offered it to the Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s-Amusantes, formerly on the boulevard du Temple but since 1 January 1785 playing in a temporary theatre in the gardens of the Palais-Royal. This company changed its name to Th√©√¢tre du Palais-Royal on 15 December 1789, and later moved into the new theatre upon its completion, where they opened on 15 May 1790. On 25 April 1791 the anti-royalist faction of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, led by Talma, left that company's theatre on the left bank (at that time known as the Th√©√¢tre de la Nation, but today as the Od√©on), and joined the company on the rue de Richelieu, which promptly changed its name to Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais de la rue de Richelieu. With the founding of the French Republic in September 1792 the theatre's name was changed again, to Th√©√¢tre de la R√©publique. In 1799 the players of the split company reunited at the Palais-Royal, and the theatre officially became the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, also commonly known as the Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais, names which it retains to this day.Netter 1996, pp. 69‚Äì70; Hemmings 1994, pp. 60‚Äì63; see also the entry \\"Vari√©t√©s-Amusantes\\" in Lecomte 1905, p. 55, and the entry \\"Fran√ßais de la rue Richelieu\\" on p. 29.. =Palais de l'√âgalit√© and the Revolution= Palais Royal Gardens: Illustration, from an 1863 guide to Paris, enlarges the apparent scale.

During the revolutionary period, Philippe d'Orl√©ans became known as Philippe √âgalit√© and ruled at the Palais de l'√âgalit√©, as it was known during the more radical phase of the Revolution,Segard; Testard (1814).

Along the galeries, ladies of the night lingered, and smart gambling casinos were lodged in second-floor quarters. There was a theatre at each end of the galleries; the larger one has been the seat of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, the state theatre company, since Napoleon laid its administrative reorganisation in the d√©cret de Moscou on 15 October 1812, which contains 87 articles.Bouchard, Alfred (1878).

The very first theatre in the Palais-Royal was built by Lemercier for Cardinal Richelieu, and inaugurated in 1641. Under Louis XIV, the theater hosted plays by Moli√®re, from 1660 to Moli√®re's death in 1673, followed by the Opera under the direction of Jean-Baptiste Lully. From the 1780s to 1837, the palace was once again the centre of Parisian political and social intrigue and the site of the most popular caf√©s. The historic restaurant \\"Le Grand V√©four\\" is still there. In 1786, a noon cannon was set up by a philosophical amateur, set on the prime meridian of Paris, in which the sun's noon rays, passing through a lens, lit the cannon's fuse. The noon cannon is still fired at the Palais-Royal, though most of the ladies for sale have disappeared, those who inspired the Abb√© Delille's lines; :\\"Dans ce jardin on ne rencontre :Ni champs, ni pr√©s, ni bois, ni fleurs. :Et si l'on y d√©r√®gle ses m≈ìurs, :Au moins on y r√®gle sa montre.\\" (\\"In this garden one encounters neither fields nor meadows nor woods nor flowers. And, if one upsets one's morality, at least one may re-set one's watch.\\") The Marquis de Sade referred to the grounds in front of the palace in his Philosophy in the Bedroom (1795) as a place where progressive pamphlets were sold. Upon the death of the Duke, the palace's ownership lapsed to the state, whence it was called Palais du Tribunat. Bourbon restoration After the Restoration of the Bourbons, at the Palais-Royal the young Alexandre Dumas obtained employment in the office of the powerful duc d'Orl√©ans, who regained control of the Palace during the Restoration. In the Revolution of 1848, the Paris mob trashed and looted the Palais-Royal. Under the Second Empire the Palais-Royal was home to the cadet branch of the Bonaparte family, represented by Prince Napoleon, Napoleon III's cousin.

At the rear of the garden, north of the Palais-Royal on the Rue de Richelieu are the older buildings of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France.

It serves light rail, intercity rail, intercity bus, and local bus services. It is the eastern terminus for the METRO Green Line light rail line, with the stop located outside the station's headhouse. It is also the Twin Cities' stop for Amtrak, the national intercity railroad service. In addition to rail, Union Depot also serves Metro Transit, MVTA, Jefferson Lines, Greyhound, and MegaBus. The headhouse, located at the 4th Street entrance, was designed by architect Charles Sumner Frost and is neoclassical in style. The concourse and the waiting room that extend over the tracks are viewed as a great architectural achievements. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. It is also a contributing property to the Lowertown Historic District. In addition to its transit uses, Union Depot also contains a Hertz rental car location, coffee shop, restaurant, a bike shop, offices, a museum, and loft condominiums. History =Original Union Depot= There have been two Union Depots in Saint Paul. The first was completed in 1881, and combined the services of several different railroads into one building (hence the \\"union\\"; see Union station). In 1888 the old station had its peak year, handling eight million passengers. That year, about 150 trains departed daily. Around this time, the building was remodeled with a taller central tower and other alterations to the roofline. This station burned in 1915. =Current building= The current structure was started in 1917 but was not completed until 1923 because World War I caused construction to halt for several years. During its heyday, the depot hosted the passenger trains of nine railroads, and more than 20 million pieces of mail passed through the station to the neighboring St. Paul Central Downtown Post Office annually. At its peak in the 1920s, there were 282 train movements daily. The waiting room stood atop nine platforms serving 18 tracks; the eight northern ones closest to the headhouse were stub-end tracks, while the other ten ran through. However, track ownership and trackage rights west of the station meant that most trains operated as though the station was a stub terminal. These trains, when they were intended to continue beyond the station, instead backed up to a wye just to the east to get to other main lines. The Saint Paul Union Depot Company controlled of St. Paul trackage and terminal facilities, including the depot building. The company was operated in tandem with the Minnesota Transfer Railway Company, with effective control of both properties exercised by the same board, composed of representatives of the nine tenants. Train ridership began to erode in the 1920s as the automobile took hold and airlines began to operate. The railroads sought ways stem the flow of passengers and compete with these new forms of transportation. As the Great Depression unfolded, more aggressive moves were required. The streamliner era in the United States began in 1934 with the introduction of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy's Zephyr. After making a \\"Dawn-to-Dusk Dash\\" from Chicago to Denver, Colorado, the CB&Q;'s interest soon turned to the Twin Cities run. A demonstration run was completed in 6 hours and 4 minutes, including six one-minute stops. Other railroads were soon busy investigating how to run faster trains to Saint Paul and Minneapolis. William Crooks locomotive being set up as a static display in the station's waiting room in 1954. The engine remained on display there until 1975, when it was moved to the Lake Superior Railroad Museum in Duluth. The first locomotive to run in Minnesota, the William Crooks, was displayed at the depot from 1955 until the station's 1971 closure, after which it was moved to the Lake Superior Railroad Museum in Duluth. =Early high-speed trains= On January 2, 1935, high-speed express service to Chicago was introduced on the Chicago and North Western Railway's 400, cutting the scheduled time between the two cities from about 10 hours down to 7. Time dubbed the 400, \\"the fastest train scheduled on the American Continent, fastest in all the world on a stretch over 200 mi.\\" The C&NW; beat two other railroads which had been planning 6¬Ω hour service to begin in the spring. The Milwaukee Road's Hiawatha and the Burlington Route's Twin Cities Zephyr were introduced with 6¬Ω hour service a few months later at the same time, and C&NW; matched their schedules. The Burlington Zephyrs were the first streamlined diesel-electric trains to serve the Twin Cities, and originally ran in an articulated configuration. The 400 (now renamed the Twin Cities 400) followed in 1939, but using more conventional trucks and couplers to link passenger cars together. The Hiawatha had always been powered by a streamlined (or, in the terminology of the Milwaukee Road, \\"speedlined\\") steam locomotive. The Twin Cities Zephyrs added a second set of trains daily in 1936, running the Morning Zephyr and Afternoon Zephyr from each terminal. The Hiawatha added a second set of trains in 1939, and the Morning Hiawatha and Afternoon Hiawatha each provided daily service from Minneapolis-St. Paul and Chicago. The Morning Hiawatha may have held the record as the world's fastest steam train on two or more measures: The run from Sparta to Portage, Wisconsin was scheduled for 58 minutes--an average of . Speeds up to and above were achieved on a daily basis, and the powerful Milwaukee Road class F7 engines (designed for a \\"reserve speed\\" of ) likely ran more miles at or above than any other steam locomotives in history. Burlington's diesel Zephyrs were also very fast, and they had to be‚Äîthe Zephyr route was about longer than the competition. In southwestern Wisconsin, a stretch of track between stations required an average speed of . Eventually, the Hiawathas, Zephyrs, and the 400 ran 6¬º-hour service between St. Paul and Chicago, and for a time the Morning Zephyr from Chicago reached St. Paul in six hours flat. In the 1950s, the federal government began imposing stricter rules for high-speed operation, and expensive advanced signaling was installed along the routes to the Twin Cities, though trains generally traveled a maximum of . Unable to keep up with an increasing automobile speeds on an improving road network and other factors that kept passengers away from trains, train ridership declined and the five daily fast trains became unprofitable. =End of service= The Twin Cities 400 was the first victim, ending service on July 23, 1963. It was announced that when Amtrak formally took over most passenger service on May 1, 1971, it would consolidate its Twin Cities service in Minneapolis at the Minneapolis Great Northern Depot. Accordingly, the Burlington (later Burlington Northern) Zephyrs ended service on April 30, 1971, the same day the depot closed. The Afternoon Zephyr was the last train to serve the depot when it departed that evening bound for Minneapolis. At this time, this train was normally combined with the Empire Builder and North Coast Limited from Chicago to St. Paul, except on Fridays when it ran as a separate train. Since April 30 was a Friday, the Zephyr had the \\"honor\\" of being the last train to depart the station.Steve Glischinski, eyewitness account at depot on April 30, 1971. =Restoration and return of passenger service= Exterior of the station during renovation Area boosters had long hoped that trains would return to the Union Depot, and plans gathered steam as the Blue Line light rail project in Minneapolis drew toward completion. Planners envisioned the depot being used for a restored Amtrak service along with Metro and Jefferson Lines buses. A few businesses had occupied the headhouse since the halt of train service in 1971, while the United States Postal Service (USPS) took over the rear of the building. The concourse and waiting room were used for some postal service activities and storage. After lying dormant for several years in the 1970s, the train tracks were removed from the train deck and it was paved with a flat surface. It began to be used for staging semi-trailer trucks carrying mail to and from the neighboring Downtown St. Paul Central Post Office as well as USPS employee parking. A driveway ramp was sliced into the train deck at the intersection of Kellogg Boulevard and Broadway Street for USPS vehicles. In the early 2000s, the upper levels of the headhouse were converted into 33 2-story loft condominiums. Grand opening of the newly renovated waiting room In 2005, the Ramsey County Regional Railroad Authority secured funding to renovate the station as an intermodal transit hub served by Amtrak trains, Metro Transit light rail, and intercity bus lines. In June 2009, the Ramsey County Board approved purchasing the depot headhouse for $8.2 million, to serve as a METRO Green Line light rail station and for future passenger rail use. In 2010, USPS moved most of the truck operations to a bulk mail processing center in Eagan, Minnesota, making way for rehabilitation of the depot as a rail hub. Demolition of the Postal Service building that blocked track access to the station began in mid-March 2011. The USPS ramp cut all the way across the train deck and blocked the ability for tracks to be installed, so the ramp was modified during restoration to make a roughly right-angle turn to access new bus platforms on the north end of the train deck while freeing up room for a few tracks to be restored on the south end. The renovation was completed in late November 2012 at a cost of $243 million, of which $35 million was provided by the US government through the TIGER program. The renovated station re-opened to the public on December 8, 2012. The first Amtrak train to service Saint Paul Union Depot was the westbound Empire Builder which stopped at the station at 11:30pm on May 7, 2014, 70 minutes late heading en route to Seattle and Portland. Officials welcomed the first passengers to depart the train at the depot. Special Events Milwaukee Road 261 decorated as the North Pole Express in 2014 at St. Paul Union Depot Since opening in late 2012, the Depot has hosted a number of events. On May 10, 2014 (National Train Day), the depot hosted Great Northern Railway Historical Society's SD45 #400 (Hustle Muscle) from the Jackson Street Roundhouse, as well as some historical equipment. Amtrak displayed three Superliner cars. There were several other displays around the Depot grounds. In December 2014, for the first time in nearly 50 years, an active steam locomotive returned to St. Paul Union Depot. Milwaukee Road 261 and some historic passenger cars, decorated as the \\"North Pole Express\\" ran short excursions to and from the depot. It was determined to be an overwhelming success, with intentions to operate the train again in 2015. While Milwaukee Road 261 was present, the Depot also got a visit from Canadian Pacific's traveling Holiday Train. On May 9, 2015, the depot hosted National Train Day events once more, with GN SD45 #400 from the Great Northern Railway Historical Society and Jackson Street Roundhouse, BNSF Railway sent a GE ES44C4 to the event and pulled some of the Milwaukee Road 261 excursion cars that were also displayed there. Amtrak displayed a new Viewliner II baggage car that was about to begin service on the Empire Builder. On December 9, 2017 Metro Transit and BNSF operated a Northstar Holiday Train between Big Lake and St. Paul Union Depot. Service was free of charge, and ridership was around 1,500. The event has become an annual tradition. =Union Depot Train Day= Every year in May, the depot hosts a weekend of events named \\"Train Day\\" which showcases the history and future of railroad travel. Those in attendance are treated to model train layouts, exhibitors, tours and railroad equipment displays. This event replaced \\"National Train Day\\" after Amtrak disbanded the program after 2015. http://www.uniondepot.org/traindays/ On April 30 and May 1, 2016, the depot hosted a two-day event titled \\"Union Depot Train Days\\" to celebrate the building's 90th Anniversary. Various displays, vendors, and photographers were featured inside the depot. Outside featured numerous rail equipment, including Milwaukee Road 261 under steam with 4 passenger cars, Amtrak's Exhibit Train, Twin Cities and Western Railroad locomotive, Great Northern 325, a rare EMD SDP40 and Northern Pacific RPO #1102 from the Minnesota Transportation Museum, and Soo Line FP7a #2500. https://www.eventbrite.com/e/laker-rail-program- friday-night-photoshoot-tickets-20920727459# On May 6, 2017, featured railroad equipment included Amtrak 42, the Veteran's locomotive, two Union Pacific locomotives, a TC&W; locomotive and GN 325 and NP 1102. NP RPO #1102 had the distinction of being the \\"Last Mail Train\\" as Train Day attendees had mail transported inside the car from Union Depot to Osceola, Wisconsin. On May 5, 2018, Burlington Northern 6234 and Soo Line 559 were displayed along with Great Northern business car A-11, once an executive car for James J. Hill's family, along with Union Pacific's Chicago & Northwestern 'heritage' locomotive. 2019 Train Days was held May 31-June 2 and featured Soo Line 700 from Duluth and other unannounced equipment. Services =Amtrak= Empire Builder at Union Depot Serving this station is the Empire Builder, named to honor Saint Paul-based mogul James J. Hill who constructed the Great Northern Railroad, and whose nickname was \\"The Empire Builder\\". Westbound trains head for Spokane, Washington and split there to serve both Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon; eastbound trains head for Chicago. The Empire Builder originally stopped at the station from 1929 until 1971. In 1971, Amtrak consolidated all passenger rail service for the Twin Cities at the Great Northern Station in Minneapolis, and in 1978 moved to the Midway Station in Saint Paul, about halfway between the downtowns of the two cities. Service returned to the Union Depot from Midway in 2014 after it was delayed for almost two years from the depot's initial grand re-opening in 2012 due to negotiations with the owners of the railroads (Canadian Pacific Railway, BNSF Railway, and Union Pacific Railroad) in the area and the construction of new complex signals on the Merriam Park Subdivision. Westbound trains arrive from Chicago in the middle of the night, usually around 10:30 p.m. Eastbound trains arrive from Seattle or Portland around breakfast time. Also included is an Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach to Duluth via Jefferson Lines. The station appears as St. Paul-Minneapolis in Amtrak timetables. =Light rail= Union Depot Light Rail Station The depot serves as the METRO Green Line light rail line's eastern terminus. The Green Line runs between St. Paul and Minneapolis with its western terminus at Target Field station in the North Loop area of Downtown Minneapolis. The stop is in front of the headhouse, rather than at a platform under the waiting room. The line opened on June 14, 2014. Utility relocation work in preparation for the Green Line began in front of the depot on 4th Street in August 2009, well before the line received final funding or approval. Track was laid from 2011‚Äì2012. While the Union Depot is the eastern terminus of service, the tracks continue beyond the station to the line's maintenance facility. =Intercity bus service= *Greyhound Lines arrived at Saint Paul Union Depot in March 2014 after initially pulling out of the project two years prior. Greyhound offers at least six coach bus departures a day and additional weekend service. *Jefferson Lines relocated from Midway Station to Saint Paul Union Depot in 2013. *Megabus =Local and regional bus service= *Metro Transit: 3, 16, 21, 54, 63, 70, 94, 262, 350, 351, 361, 364 and 417. *Minnesota Valley Transit Authority: 480, 484, 489. Planned services The current vision for the depot is to create a hub for intercity connections for local & regional bus service, light rail, and commuter rail. =Light rail and bus rapid transit= Bus rapid transit (BRT) has been selected for the Rush Line Corridor between St. Paul and White Bear Lake. The southern terminus of this route is planned to be at St. Paul Union Depot. The Gateway Corridor (now called the Gold Line) is also planned to be bus rapid transit and will operate between St. Paul and Woodbury. The Red Rock Corridor has also been proposed as a BRT service and eventually being upgraded to commuter rail, however plans are on hold as ridership on the current bus routes in this corridor are low. The Riverview Corridor is planned to be a LRT/modern streetcar hybrid operating between St. Paul Union Depot and Mall of America. Riverview Corridor trains would share tracks and stations with the Metro Green Line between Central Station and Union Depot Station. =Regional rail= Numerous existing freight rail lines branch out from St. Paul Union Depot and could be upgraded and utilized by regional passenger trains. Currently MnDOT has studied regional rail from St. Paul Union Depot to Mankato, Northfield, and Minneapolis (continuing further west as a through- service). In 2010, the Minnesota Department of Transportation also released a plan for regional rail stretching out from the Twin Cities to rural Minnesota and neighboring states, and at least some of the lines would run to Saint Paul. =High-speed rail= New trains running at speeds above to Chicago have also been discussed since at least 1991. The Midwest Regional Rail Initiative (MWRRI), led by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation, has proposed a link to the Twin Cities running at up to . The planned schedule time to Saint Paul would be just 5¬Ω hours. Others including the French national railway SNCF, which operates the TGV network, have proposed trains running at up to . Local significance Prior to the station's reopening in December 2012, Josh Collins, a spokesperson for Ramsey County Regional Rail Authority, referred to the potential of the station to be \\"the living room of Saint Paul.\\" =Architecture= The entrance to Union Depot, the headhouse, is considered a somewhat severe example of neoclassical architecture, with a robust aesthetic. A series of tall Doric columns line the front fa√ßade. The concourse and the waiting room that extends out to the platforms, where trains once rolled in, is considered to be one of the great architectural achievements in the city. The building was designed by Charles Frost. The waiting room is flooded with natural light from skylights. These skylights were blackened during the Second World War, but restored for the 2012 re-opening. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The restoration and new addition were designed by Hammel, Green and Abrahamson Architects & Engineers (HGA). =Railway mapping= Milepost for rail lines that originated in Saint Paul, such as the Great Northern and Northern Pacific, had used the depot as milepost 0. This is still evident in timetables and mileposts used by the BNSF RailwayBNSF Twin Cities Division Timetable No. 2. November 17, 2004. Note: The Midway Subdivision and St. Paul Subdivision both begin at Seventh Street junction. The Staples Subdivision (ex combined GN and NP) and Wayzata Subdivision (ex GN) continue the numbering.

It carries Interstate 405 and US 30 traffic between downtown and North Portland where it intersects with Interstate 5. It has the longest main span of any bridge in Oregon and is the second longest tied-arch bridge in the world (after Caiyuanba Bridge across the Yangtze River, China). The bridge was designed by Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade and Douglas, and built by Murphy Pacific Corporation. The bridge has two decks carrying vehicular traffic, each with four lanes. The upper deck is signed westbound on US 30 and southbound on I-405. The lower deck is signed eastbound on US 30 and northbound on I-405. Design and construction Due to the public's dissatisfaction with the appearance of the Marquam Bridge, the Portland Art Commission was invited to participate in the design process of the Fremont. The improvement in visual quality resulted in a bridge that was nearly six times as expensive as the purposely economical Marquam Bridge. Designers modeled the bridge after the original 1964 Port Mann Bridge in Vancouver, British Columbia. The steel tie-girder (I-beam) is tall and wide. On October 28, 1971, while still under construction, a crack was found on the west span of this girder that required a $5.5 million redesign and repair. The ramps and approaches are steel box girders. If the lanes of the bridge were placed end-to-end, there are on the arch bridge and on the ramps and approaches. The center span of the bridge, where the rib of the arch is above the deck, is long. It was fabricated in California then assembled at Swan Island, downstream. After assembly it was floated on a barge the 1.7 mile trip to the construction site. On March 16, 1973, the steel arch span was lifted using 32 hydraulic jacks. At the time, it was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the heaviest lift ever completed. The bridge was opened on November 15, 1973,\\"Fremont Bridge opens with wheeze\\". The Oregonian, November 16, 1973, p. 22. at a final cost of $82 million (equivalent to $ million in ), most of which was financed by the Federal Highway Administration. In 1976, an American flag and an Oregon flag were added atop the structure as part of the bicentennial celebration for the United States.\\"News Q&A;\\", The Oregonian, May 1, 2005. The flags were installed with the use of a helicopter. The flags are attached to tall flagpoles at the crest of the arches. Falcon nest The Fremont Bridge was also the 26th Peregrine falcon nest site designated in Oregon in 1995 after the raptor was placed on the U.S. Threatened and Endangered Species list in 1970. Etymology The bridge as well as Portland's associated Fremont Street were named for John C. Fremont (1813‚Äì1890). Fremont was an early explorer of the Oregon Country. He served in the United States Army at the time as a Captain and later promoted to General. In 1856, he ran for president, but was defeated by James Buchanan.Snyder, Eugene E..

Requirement of statutorily prescribed procedures to improve effectiveness of child support enforcement. Bill Bradley requires state courts to prohibit retroactive reduction of child support obligations. Specifically, it: * automatically triggers a non-expiring lien whenever child support becomes past-due. * overrides any state's statute of limitations. * disallows any judicial discretion, even from bankruptcy judges. * requires that the payment amounts be maintained without regard for the physical capability of the person owing child support (the obligor) to promptly document changed circumstances or regard for his awareness of the need to make the notification. But, like any other past-due debt, the obligee may forgive what is owed to them. When past-due child support is owed to a state as a result of welfare paid out, the state is free to forgive some or all of it under what's known as an \\"offer in compromise\\". The state and government agencies are non-profit organizations. History The amendment text was included in the Sixth Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, 1986, bill S.2706. > Subtitle C: Miscellaneous Provisions - Amends part D Child Support of title > IV of the Act to prohibit the retroactive modification of child support > arrearages except with respect to such arrearages which accumulate after the > obligee and entity which is issued the child support order receive notice > that the obligor has pending an active application for modification of such > order. Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, introduced the amendment in an earlier bill on May 5, 1986. It passed in the Senate with amendments with an 88-7 yea-nay vote on September 20, 1986. Intent The amendment was intended to correct a perceived imbalance between the power of the obligee usually the mother and the obligor usually the father during subsequent child support disputes. It had been alleged that a significant number of men were running up large child support debts and then finding a sympathetic judge, often in another state, to erase them. Results The Bradley Amendment is credited with increases in the collections success of wealthy debtors including a New York plastic surgeon who owed $172,000, a professional athlete who owed $76,000 and a yacht company owner who owed $50,000. According to Sherri Z. Heller, Ed.D, Commissioner of U.S. Office of Child Support Enforcement, the child support system collects \\"about 58% of current support due.\\" The US Department of Health and Human Services estimates that 68% of child support cases had arrearages owed in 2003 a figure up from 53% in 1999 - however this information is based on data supplied only by the custodial parent so it is viewed with extreme doubt. Some believe that the process can never collect the full amount because a high proportion of obligors are unable to make the required payments. According to Ford Foundation Project Officer Ronald B. Mincy, between 16 percent and 33 percent of obligors are \\"turnip dads\\" obligors earning less than $130 a week. According to one study 38% of non- custodial parents not paying child-support said they lacked the money to pay. The Health and Human Services numbers above omit closed cases. Typically, cases are closed after four years of inactivity. Open or closed, past-due child support automatically triggers a non expiring lien. Legality In September 1999, Marilyn Ray Smith, the Chief Legal Counsel for the Massachusetts Department of Revenue, Child Support Enforcement Division gave the following testimonyMarilyn Ray Smith's testimony before the United States House of Representatives September 1999 Marilyn Ray Smith's testimony before the United States House of Representatives. > As you know, under the Bradley Amendment enacted by the U.S. Congress in > 1986, a child support obligation becomes a judgment by operation of law as > of the date that that it is due and unpaid. In addition, under Section 368 > of PRWORA an administrative lien also arises by operation of law against any > unpaid child support. It is therefore not necessary to return to court after > each payment is missed to get past-due support reduced to a judgment in > order to obtain a lien or enforce a judgment. This means that a child > support agency can move quickly to seize income and assets of a delinquent > noncustodial parent without first passing through a judicial or quasi- > judicial hearing process. From 2004, the Bradley Amendment was challenged as unconstitutional and was the subject of a repeal effort; in February 2006 the court case was dismissed. On March 10, 2013, a petition was posted on the Obama administration's We the People website to \\"stop\\" the Bradley Amendment, on the grounds that it was unconstitutional. Controversy =Notable cases= The Amendment has been a controversial law and has resulted in several notorious examples: * Bobby Sherrill, a Lockheed employee in Kuwait from North Carolina, was captured by Iraqis and spent nearly five months as an Iraqi hostage. Sherrill was arrested the night after his release for not paying $1,425 in child support while he was a hostage. * Clarence Brandley, a Texas high school janitor, was wrongly convicted in 1980 of murder. After spending many years in prison and on death row, he was released in 1990 and he then sued the state of Texas for wrongful imprisonment in 1993. The state then responded with a bill for nearly $50,000 in child support that had not been paid while in prison. Dianna Thompson of The American Coalition of Fathers and Children told the Houston Chronicle that federal law makes it illegal for states to forgive child support payments regardless of circumstance. Michael McCormick, of the American Coalition of Fathers and Children said, concerning child support payments, \\"I'm not aware of any state where it says a wrongly convicted individual is relieved of their obligation.\\" Despite paying child support every month since his release via wage garnishment, Brandley's child support total reached $73,000 in 2003, when a judge reduced his total to $22,000; however, this amount is still more than triple the $7,000 in back child support Brandley owed at the time of his arrest in 1980. Brandley lost his job in the economic downturn in 2008; he has since lost his car and house as the child support bills and interest keep coming. * Taron James, a U.S. Navy veteran from California, was forced to continue to pay child support until 2006, even after the child was demonstrated by DNA test in 2001 to be not his; James paid $12,000 in such payments. A California District Court of Appeal eventually set aside the paternity judgment against James in 2006, but the same court denied James' request to have his child support payments reimbursed. * Larry Souter was wrongly convicted of murder in 1992 and spent 13 years in prison before being exonerated and released in 2005. Upon release, he was ordered to court to explain why he shouldn't be held in contempt for failing to pay $38,000 in combined back child support, interest, and penalties. Payments were not suspended for at least 3 years while he was in prison. The interest and penalties accumulated while he was still in prison, and presumably unable to pay. * Geoffrey Fisher was taken to court in 2001 due to being delinquent on child support payments, and had his driver's license suspended. Fisher pushed for custody, and a state-ordered paternity test determined he was not the biological father. In January 2002 a judge determined he no longer had to pay child support, but the attorney general's office claimed that Fisher still owed $11,450, approximately 3 year's worth of back support payments from the time of the child's birth until the time of the paternity test. State officials have stated that this is because Fisher failed to file a court motion to relieve himself of financial responsibility to the child, and that Fisher is thus regarded as the legal father and responsible for child support.

Hoshin Engi is inspired by the Chinese literary classic Investiture of the Gods, a shenmo novel. The story involves the Chinese mythology and history of China, in particular the last members of the In (Yin Dynasty aka Shang Dynasty) and the plot to overthrow them. The manga series was serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine from 1996‚Äì2000 and compiled in 23 tank≈çbon volumes by Shueisha. The manga has been re-released and re-compiled into fewer larger volumes with new cover art, illustrations and afterwords. The 18 kanzenban volumes were released periodically between July 2005 and April 2006 in Japan only. The story has been adapted into a 26-episodes anime series titled Senkaiden H≈çshin Engi, broadcast on TV Tokyo from July to December 1999. A new 23-episode anime television series adaptation titled Haky≈´ H≈çshin Engi and featuring a new cast aired from January to June 2018. Fujisaki also wrote a short manga series that was serialized in Weekly Young Jump from April to June 2018. In North America, Viz Media acquired the rights to the manga for English language release. The first anime series was first licensed by ADV Films and released as Soul Hunter in 2001. It was later acquired by Discotek Media in 2016. Synopsis =Setting= The fantastic world of Hoshin Engi encompass both the pre-historical world‚Äîin which primitive human society coexist with the revered divine gods and goddesses‚Äîand the futuristic world‚Äîin which highly technological weaponry, combat strategy, as well as futuristic visions, are employed. Paopei, the sacred weapons used by Doshi and Sennin alike, are versatile instruments created Sennin. The Seven Super Paopei were the ones left from the Original People, and all the rest are copies made from those. Paopei can only be used by Sendou, those born with Sennin bones which are trained to be used to power paopei. If someone born with these bones is not trained, then they become a Tennen Doushi, and the potential of their skeleton creates almost super natural strength or speed; however, they would never be able to use a Paopei. It is possible to transplant Sennin bones into a normal human, as in the case with Younin, but it does not appear to be a common practice. There are such beings as \\"human Paopei,\\" that is, a living being created from a paopei. They all have a core they are built around, and can take extensive damage and be rebuilt so long as the core remains intact. Besides paopei, there are spells, an ancient form a magic rarely used by the time series takes place. The only ones seen in the series are the peaches that can turn water into sake, Youzen's transformation technique, and Nentou's various fighting and healing abilities. =Plot= The story is set in legendary China. A beautiful female fox spirit named is controlling the emperor and the ruling dynasty, and is using her power over him to do evil in the nation. An immortal-in-training named is chosen by the great immortal sages for the ‚Äîto seal away or destroy the evil demons that infest the world. In the course of his adventures, Taik≈çb≈ç gathers other powerful companions and sets out to seal away the demons and eventually destroy the fox spirit Dakki. There are significant plot differences between the novel, the manga series and the animated adaptations. Manga plot The 23-volume-long series follows the adventures of Taikobo and his trusty . Taikobo was given a mission by Genshi-tenson (ÂÖÉÂßãÂ§©Â∞ä) (Taikobou's mentor and the leader of the Sennin (‰ªô‰∫∫) World‚ÄîKonron (Â¥ëÂ¥ô)) to complete the Houshin Project. The goal of the Hoshin Project, as explained by Genshitenson, is to trap Dakki and her minions in a 'middle' world between the Sennin World and the Human world, renamed (Deity or Gods) World, named 'Shinkai', Realm of the Gods. Taikobo's mission is to hunt down the 365 people whose names were written on the Hoshin Scroll. As Taikobo defeats and seals off each of the 365 people on the scroll, their souls are instantly transported to the Hoshindai (a floating island made to trap souls) and sealed there until all the 365 souls are gathered. At first, Taikobo refused to take up such a troublesome mission, but when threatened with expulsion from Konron, he quickly relented. After that, he was given a , (in Chinese literally \\"Gods-Hitting Whip\\"), as his weapon along with Supushan. Upon leaving Konron, Taikobou and Supushan immediately met up with the first person listed on the Houshin Scroll, the all-powerful Shinkouhyou (Áî≥ÂÖ¨Ë±π) and his Riding Beast‚ÄîKokutenko (ÈªíÁÇπËôé). After a short battle between the two , in which Taikoubou was easily defeated, Taikoubou suspected that the order of the Houshin Scroll is sorted according to strength (Shinkouhyou being the first on the list) and decides to avoid fighting him. Aiming for the core of the whole problem, he enters the capital, Chouka and defeating one of Dakki's sisters, Ou Kijin (who reverted to her original form, a stone lute), he used her to enter the service of the emperor in order to spot Dakki's weakness. Furious with her sister's plight, Dakki contrives a plan to reclaim her sister. Taikoubou, overwhelmed by her guile, was defeated and was about to be thrown into the taibon (a pit full of poisonous snakes) along with some of the Kyou clan, when during a commotion caused by them, Buuseiou Ko Hiko saved him. It was then that he came to a realization that there was no way he could take on Dakki and her followers, on his own. That's why he set off searching for strong fighters to join him on his quest to rid the world of Dakki. Taikoubou soon met up and joined forces with Nataku (Âì™Âêí), Raishinshi (Èõ∑ÈúáÂ≠ê), Kou-Tenka (ÈªÑÂ§©Âåñ) and Youzen (Ê•äÊà©). As the series progresses, Taikobo slowly realises that there is no hope in disrupting Dakki's strangle hold on the Yin Dynasty or her influence over Chuuou. As such, he abandoned the kingdom and requested that Ki Sh≈ç (Âß´Êòå) form a new Monarchy to rival the Yin, renamed the Sh≈´ Dynasty (Âë®) with their new emperor‚ÄîBu-ou (Ê≠¶Áéã), who is the second son of Ki Hatsu who had died due to self-starvation caused by Dakki serving him his son as a hamburger during his capture. Taikoubou then became the military advisor to Zhou, helping the Western Army conquer the lands once owned by Yin. Bunch≈´ (ËÅû‰ª≤), the senior advisor to the emperor Ch≈´-ou in the country of Yin and also a pao-pei user, sees Taikoubou as an obstacle and sends out some of his best Doushi companions to attack Taikoubou and company. The ensuing fights between the two groups eventually lead to the involvement of almost all members of the 2 Sennin Worlds‚ÄîKonron (where Taikoubou originates) and (where Bunchuu learnt his arts). At the climax of the Sennin war, both worlds were completely destroyed with hundreds of souls sealed into the Houshin Dai. And though Bunchuu was eventually defeated, Taikoubou lost many friends and his home in the process. Eventually, after Taikoubou and the Zhou army successfully defeated Chuuou and officially declared the fall of the Yin Dynasty, Taikoubou and company decided to leave the Human world and return to what's left of the Sennin world. It is then revealed to him that there is possibly a third Sennin World, one that belongs to Dakki, and is probably where she and the last of her minions fled to when the Yin country was finally conquered. Genshitenson also reveals to Taikoubou that the real goal of Houshin Project isn't just about defeating Dakki, it is about defeating the eternal being supporting Dakki throughout all her chaos years‚ÄîJyoka (Â•≥Â™ß), one of the ancients. The ultimate enemy of Houshin Engi, Jyoka, is a \\"Jui Que\\", one of five 'aliens' which landed on the Earth, millions of years ago. Jyoka had a dream to recreate her home world on Earth (which had self-destructed some time ago), but the other aliens disagreed and enclosed her in a glass cage. Later, she was able to move about in her \\"soul\\" form and direct the trend of history to her liking. This is when she met up with Dakki, and the two started working together to make Jyoka's dream come true. Each time history diverted from what Jyoka wants it to become, she completely destroyed the civilization that existed and started all over again, like a child moulding a perfect sand castle. No one really knows how many civilisations Jyoka had destroyed throughout time in her pursuit to perfectly replicate her old home, but when asked why she's trying to do this, Jyoka simply states that she would like to know what would have happened if her home planet had not made those simple mistakes that led to its own destruction. After hearing the ultimate truth, the Sennins retaliated against Jyoka. Soon, she finally decided to destroy Earth once and for all, and find another world in order to replicate her old home. The battles raged for a while before the deceased Taikoubou (who had 'died' recently) reappeared in front of his comrades again. This time, it is revealed that he was once one of the \\"Jui Que\\" as well, the last of the 5 aliens and was left on this earth for the sole purpose of killing Jyoka once and for all. Using the energy of his friends as well as those souls trapped in the Houshin Dai, Taikoubou (now renamed 'Fukki') was finally able to defeat Jyoka and release the world from her influences. Just prior to this happening, Dakki somehow managed to take over Jyoka's body for a time and merged with the life energies of the Earth, becoming the mother of all life. After the fight with Jyoka ended, Jyoka selfishly asked Taikoubou to disappear together with her, afraid of being left alone again and since Taikoubou felt that he had done what he had set out to do, complies (also due to severe injuries in the last fight). When he was about to fade away, Dakki came and saved his life, thus reviving him. In the epilogue, Youzen was made the Headmaster of the new Sennin World, with Choukei (Bunchuu's only disciple) representing the Youkai (demons) and Nentou-doujin (ex-Juunisen, who helped defeat Jyoka) representing the Humans, supporting him. Genshi-tenson manages the ex-Houshindai, which houses all the souls which had been houshined, and dispatches them to the Human World if their help is needed. Since these souls are invisible to the Human eye, they are able to solve matters without being seen. When Supushan and Bukichi went to the Human World to update Buou on the happenings of the Sennin World, they found out that Taikoubou is still alive (he visited Buou before they arrived) and went in search for him but to no avail as Taikoubou seemed keen on avoiding them to the extent of following them behind their backs without them knowing, and somehow prevents the people they meet from revealing his whereabouts. In the end, Supushan and Bukichi returned to the Sennin World to request Youzen's help. While Taikoubou was lazing around, Shinkouhyou approached him and wanted a duel, but he left saying that it would be boring if his only rival were to perish so quickly by his hand. Taikoubou then disappeared to places unknown. Anime plot The 26-episode anime storyline somewhat follows the main plot of the manga, with the young (72-year-old) \\"doushi\\" (Apprentice to a Sennin) Taikoubou told to go from the Sennin (Immortal) world to Earth (and specifically Yin China) to hunt down 365 renegade evil spirits in order to bring down the fall of Queen Dakki, a Fox spirit who has enslaved the Emperor. Taikoubou recruits Nataku, a human/weapon hybrid, and Raishinshi, a would-be vigilante, in his quest to hunt down Dakki. He is later joined by Youzen, the Tensai (Genius) Doushi of Kunlun and Kou Tenka, the son of the duke Kou Hiko. He also rides a talking 'hippopotamus' (actually a Reijuu) named Suppushan, who remains the most popular character of the series. Ki Shou, the Lord of the West, is a man who is unwittingly destined to found the Zhou dynasty. Imprisoned for trying to stop Dakki's evil, he suffers a grievous guilt when his son is murdered and served to him as a meal, causing him to refrain from eating. Escaping from his captors, he returns with an army to overthrow the Yin with the help of Taikoubou. In the midst of this historical drama, the Immortal High Council (a group of three Immortals seemingly of a higher position than Genshi-tenson) is plotting some form of magical spell that requires the capturing of many souls, which made them deliberately lie about the purpose of the Houshin Project to Taikoubou. The anime ends with Dakki's death due to the combined efforts of Taikoubou's group and Shinkouhyou, with the Juunisen making a short appearance near the end and no mention of Jyoka.

History  In 1940, there were 156 schools in New Zealand offering secondary education: 39 secondary schools, 96 district high schools, and 21 technical high schools. In 1944, the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 15. At the same time, a gradual move started away from separate secondary schools and technical high schools toward comprehensive secondary schools serving both, and district high schools started falling out of favour to separate secondary schools. Combined with the post-World War II baby boom, the number of secondary students swelled and a large number of new secondary schools had to be built. To save construction time and costs, most secondary schools built in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were built to standard plans. By 1960, the number of secondary students had tripled from 39,000 to 140,000, and the number of secondary schools had increased to 239, comprising 102 secondary schools, 96 district high schools, and 41 technical high schools. By 1980, there were 265 secondary schools and 35 district high schools, with technical high schools having been completely phased out. In 1989, the school leaving age was raised to the present age of 16. Also in 1989, the Tomorrow's Schools reform was implemented, moving the governance of secondary schools from district education boards to individual school communities through elected boards of trustees.  Types of school  There are three types of school: state, private (or registered or independent) and state integrated schools. State and state integrated schools are government funded. Private schools receive about 25% of their funding from the government, and rely on tuition fees for the rest. State integrated schools are former private schools which are now \\"integrated\\" into the state system under the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975 \\"on a basis which will preserve and safeguard the special character of the education provided by them\\". According to Ministry of Education statistics, of the 284,052 secondary students (Years 9‚Äì15) enrolled in New Zealand schools at 1 July 2012, 81.6 percent (231,817) attend state schools, 12.6 percent (35,924) attend state integrated schools, and 5.7 percent (16,230) attend private schools. Many private schools, state area schools and state integrated schools take students from Years 0 to 13, or Years 7 to 13.  State school enrollment schemes  For state schools, the Education Amendment Act 2000 puts in place a new \\"system for determining enrollment of students in circumstances where a school has reached its roll capacity and needs to avoid overcrowding.\\" Schools which operate enrolment schemes have a geographically defined \\"home zone\\". Residence in this zone, or in the school's boarding house, if it has one, gives right of entry to the School. Students who live outside the school's home zone can be admitted, if there are places available, in the following order of priority: special programmes; siblings of currently enrolled students; siblings of past students; children of board employees; all other students. If there are more applications than available places then selection must be through a ballot, which is randomly selected. Critics have suggested that the system is fundamentally unfair as it restricts the choice for parents to choose schools and schools to choose their students. In addition, there is evidence that property values surrounding some more desirable schools become inflated, thus restricting the ability of lowers socio-economic groups to purchase a house in the zone.  School qualifications  The Government-run student qualification system is the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (\\"NCEA\\"). At some schools students can opt for IGCSE/A-levels (popularly known as \\"Cambridge exams\\") or the International Baccalaureate Diploma. NCEA has three levels, one for each of the last three years of secondary school. It contains a mix of internal and external assessments. NCEA replaced the old School Certificate, Sixth Form Certificate and Bursary systems. The IGCSE and A-level exams of the Cambridge International Examinations Board are offered at some schools. For these qualifications, IGCSE is sat in year 11, AS-level in year 12 and A-level in year 13. Neither of these independent qualifications are registered on the NZQA National Qualifications Framework. University Entrance, based on NCEA results, allows entrance to New Zealand universities. New Zealand Scholarship is a qualification pitched at students within the top stanine level.  Fees and donations  Strictly speaking, no fees need to be paid for education at a state school provided the student is a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident, or an Australian citizen. However, most schools also ask for a \\"voluntary donation\\" from parents, informally known as \\"school fees\\" or a \\"parental contribution\\".  Trades unions  The Post Primary Teachers' Association (PPTA) is the largest trade union in secondary education in New Zealand with 18,000 teaching staff employed in state and state integrated secondary schools being members. Independent Schools Education Association (ISEA) is the union for teaching and non-teaching staff in New Zealand independent (private) schools.http://www.isea.org.nz See also * Education in New Zealand * For a list of New Zealand schools with wikipedia articles, see Category:Schools in New Zealand References External links * Ministry of Education (New Zealand) * Guide to Schooling in New Zealand‚Äîcovers primary, intermediate and secondary schooling.

The districts were named by Emperor Heizei, and the name of ‚ÄúIwate‚Äù was originally written with the kanji Á£êÊâã, and appears in this form in the Yamato Monogatari, compiled in the year 951.

As with the rest of the region, the early history of Iwate District is uncertain. Although Shiwa Castle was constructed in 803 as a major army base in the region, it fell into ruins only ten years later. The area came to be ruled by the Abe clan until the Former Nine Years War (1051-1063), followed by the Kiyohara clan until the Gosannen War (1083-1089) and the Northern Fujiwara until 1189. During the Muromachi period, the area gradually came under the control of the Nanbu clan from Nukanobu District to the north. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, Iwate county consisted of one town (Morioka) and 85 villages under the control of Morioka Domain. =Early Meiji period= Following the Meiji restoration, Iwate District came under Rikuch≈´ Province and became part of Morioka Prefecture in 1871.

History The town of ≈åhasama created on April 1, 1889 with the establishment of the municipalities system. On January 1, 1955, it annexed the neighboring villages of Kamegamori, Uchikawame and Sotokawame. On January 1, 2006, ≈åhasama, along with the town of Ishidoriya (from Hienuki District), and the town of T≈çwa (from Waga District), was merged into the expanded city of Hanamaki (which lies to the south), and no longer exists as an independent municipality. As of January 1, 2006, the town had an estimated population of 6,568 and a population density of 26.6 persons per km2. The total area was 246.84 km2. Geography ≈åhasama is located roughly in the center of Iwate Prefecture; about 25 km south of the prefectural capital of Morioka. ≈åhasama is itself composed of four major areas: ≈åhasama (Â§ßËø´Ôºâproper, which lies in the center; Uchikawame (ÂÜÖÂ∑ùÁõÆ), a valley to the north; Sotokawame (Â§ñÂ∑ùÁõÆ), to the east; and to the west is the flatter farmland of Kamegamori (‰∫Ä„ÄÖÊ£Æ). In the northeast section of ≈åhasama is Mt. Hayachine (Êó©Ê±†Â≥∞Â±±Ôºâwhich, at an altitude of 1,917 m. (6,289 ft.), is the second highest mountain in Iwate Prefecture after Mt. Iwate in Morioka. ≈åhasama lies in the mountainous region of the Kitakami River area. This results in a sharp contrast between daytime and nighttime temperatures - most noticeably in the summer. It also receives little snow or rainfall compared to surrounding areas. Local Culture The climate of ≈åhasama is well suited to the growing of grapes. The town is home to the regionally well- known Edel Wine. In September, the ≈åhasama Wine House hosts the annual Wine Festival. The shrine at Mount Hayachine is famous for a local variety of Kagura ÔºàÁ•ûÊ•ΩÔºâ. Kagura dancers often appear at area festivals or functions. On a hill above the town of ≈åhasama proper stands a statue resembling the wolf-like costumes donned by Hayachine Kagura dancers. Mt. Hayachine is also home to a particular species of edelweiss, called Hayachine Usuyukisou, which grows exclusively on the mountain. It was because of this flower that mountain climbers from ≈åhasama forged a friendship with those from Berndorf, Austria, resulting in the two becoming sister cities in 1965. Around the time of Japan's Girls' Festival, ≈åhasama puts on displays of its collection of dolls: many of which are several hundred years old. Local history suggests that the dolls may have been given to residents of ≈åhasama by travelers from Kyoto on their way to trade in Hokkaid≈ç. Sister cities ≈åhasama has been twinned with Berndorf, Lower Austria, since 1965. The student exchange programme between Berndorf grammar school and ≈åhasama high school will be continued despite the incorporation. As part of the city of Hanamaki, Ohasama is also twinned with Hot Springs, Arkansas. As of 2007, ≈åhasama Junior High School has begun a sister school partnership with Jessieville Middle School in Arkansas, thanks to a friendship forged during a visit to Hanamaki by visitors from the Jessieville School.

Bryant, Jr. (March 5, 1925 - September 22, 1980), known as Jimmy Bryant, was an American country music guitarist. Biography Bryant was born in Moultrie, Georgia, the oldest of 12 children. During the Great Depression he played the fiddle on street corners to help the family buy food, pushed to do so by his father. After being wounded in World War II, he began working seriously on his guitar playing, influenced heavily by Django Reinhardt. After the war, he returned to Moultrie, then moved to Los Angeles county where he worked in Western films and played music in bars around L.A.'s Skid Row, where he met pioneering pedal steel guitarist Speedy West. West, who joined Cliffie Stone's popular Hometown Jamboree local radio and TV show, suggested Bryant be hired when the show's original guitarist departed. That gave Bryant access to Capitol Records since Stone was a Capitol artist and talent scout. In 1950 Tex Williams heard Bryant's style and used him on his recording of \\"Wild Card\\". In addition, Bryant and West played on the Tennessee Ernie Ford-Kay Starr hit \\"I'll Never Be Free\\", leading to both men being signed to Capitol as instrumentalists. Bryant and West became a team, working extensively with each other. Bryant was a difficult musician to work with. By 1955 he left Hometown Jamboree (retaining his friendship with West) and after various clashes with his Capitol producer Ken Nelson, the label dropped him in 1956. In 1957 Jimmy Bryant was a part of one of the first integrated television shows featuring popular radio and television star Jimmie Jackson who hosted the show along with black Jazz violinist and recording star, Stuff Smith and black jazz percussionist and recording star, George Jenkins. He continued working in Los Angeles and in the early 1960s he and his trio made an appearance in the Coleman Francis film The Skydivers. During the 1960s he shifted into music production. Waylon Jennings made a hit of his song \\"Only Daddy That'll Walk the Line\\". He can also be heard playing fiddle on the Monkees' \\"Sweet Young Thing\\". In the early 1970s Bryant ran a recording studio in Las Vegas, but finally relocated to Georgia before settling in Nashville in 1975, the same year he reunited with Speedy West for a reunion album produced by Nashville steel guitarist Pete Drake. Bryant played in Nashville bars and did some recording work but his personality did not mesh well with Nashville's highly political music and recording industry. In 1978, in declining health, Bryant learned that he had lung cancer; he was a heavy smoker. He died in Moultrie in September 1980 at the age of 55.

History The area of present-day Kanegasaki was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and has been settled since at least the J≈çmon period by the Emishi people. During the later portion of the Heian period, the area was ruled by the Northern Fujiwara. During the Sengoku period, the area was contested by various samurai clans before coming under the control of the Date clan of Sendai Domain during the Edo period, under the Tokugawa shogunate. The village of Kanegasaki was founded on April 1, 1889, with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. It was raised to town status on September 1, 1925. On March 1, 1955 Kanegasaki absorbed the neighboring village of Nagaoka, also from Isawa District. Government Kanegasaki has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 16 members.Kanegasaki Town official home page: Listing of town council members Kanegasaki, together with the city of ≈åsh≈´ contributes five seats to the Iwate Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Iwate 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan. Economy Kanegasaki has a relatively diverse economy that includes rice paddies typical of the region, but also extensive dairy farms in the western portion of the town and a large industrial park. The industrial park has several different manufacturing facilities, such as a Toyota plant that produces Lexus automobiles (Kant≈ç Jid≈çsha) and a Fujitsu semiconductor facility. Education Kanegasaki has five public elementary schools and one public junior high school operated by the town government and one public high school operated by the Iwate Prefectural Board of Education. In addition, the town is known for having developed a system of Life-Long Learning Centers situated throughout the town that provide educational and other opportunities for the local residents.

Authorized June 27, 1990, the 7,236 acre (29.28 km2) monument is cooperatively managed by the National Park Service and the City of Albuquerque. The western boundary of the monument features a chain of dormant fissure volcanoes. Beginning in the northwest corner, Butte volcano is followed to its south by Bond, Vulcan, Black and JA volcanoes. Petroglyph National Monument protects a variety of cultural and natural resources including five volcanic cones, hundreds of archeological sites and an estimated 24,000 images carved by Ancestral Pueblo peoples and early Spanish settlers. Many of the images are recognizable as animals, people, brands and crosses; others are more complex. Their meaning was, possibly, understood only by the carver. These images are the cultural heritage of a people who have long since moved into other areas and moved on through history for many reasons. The monument is intended as a protection for these lands and sites from and for visitors to see and appreciate for generations to come. The National Monument is managed in a manner that allows recreational use. The monument has four major sites that visitors can access, Boca Negra Canyon, Rinconada Canyon, Piedras Marcadas Canyon, and the Volcano Day Use trails.  Geologic history  Approximately 200,000 years ago, six volcanic eruptions created a cliff containing thick basalt layers of rock and cooled lava. When the volcanoes erupted, molten lava ranging in depth from 5 to 50 feet flowed downhill using old water ways, called arroyos, which eventually formed triangular, peninsula shaped channels that flowed around hills. The hills have long since eroded away over time, while the stronger basalt rocks remained, which eventually cracked and formed canyons and escarpments. As time progressed, more eruptions occurred and thicker lava cooled to form the now-extinct volcanic cones to the west of the monument; these cones can be seen from the top of the mesa. This unique formation of the landscape is called reverse topography. The basalt rocks' geologic nature allows for the creation of the petroglyphs, or rock carvings, on their surface. The rocks contain high concentrations of iron, manganese and calcium; this combination creates rocks of a gray-like color. However, over thousands of years of exposure to the desert's rough environment, a \\"desert varnish\\" forms on the surface. The varnish is formed from the oxidization, or rusting, of the manganese and iron when mixed with oxygen in the air and water from rain; this varnish is dark, almost-black and glossy in appearance. Long ago, Native Americans, as well as Spanish settlers discovered that images can be created on the faces of the rocks by chipping away at this layer using rocks and other tools.  Cultural history and significance  The petroglyph images within the monument hold deep cultural significance to Pueblo peoples and neighboring Native peoples. This rock art has complex and varied meanings. Archaeologists have dated some carvings, primarily those in the Boca Negra Canyon area, as far back as 3,000 years ago. The relative age is determined based on the darkness of the image, its context, and its comparison to other works of the same age. It is estimated that about 90 percent of the petroglyphs were created during the period between AD 1300 until the end of the 17th century because of the \\"Southwestern Style\\" used. At this time, the Native population was increasing quickly and Pueblo adobe villages were being built along the Rio Grande River and at the base of the Sandia Mountains. Stupa controversy In 1989, at least a year prior to the National Monument's establishment, a Tibetan Buddhist stupa was built and consecrated on what was then private land owned by Harold Cohen and Ariane Emery. The National Park Service subsequently used eminent domain to seize this land and make it part of the Monument, over the owners' objections. The stupa was not removed, but all buildings on the land were razed. On June 10, 2010, the Superintendent of Petroglyph National Monument sent an email stating that \\"[w]hile soils are being stockpiled nearby for the future construction of an amphitheater, the National Park Service has no plans for the Stupa.\\"News from stupa owner The Monument website was also updated to describe the construction projects and clarify that the Stupa was not to be demolished. Other controversies Suburban development currently affects the Petroglyph National Monument site. The city of Albuquerque succeeded with their plans to build a 4 lane highway directly through the site itself. Paseo del Norte Extension, Albuquerque - New Mexico  Wilson & Company The issue was featured in the documentary, Reclaiming Their Voice: The Native American Vote in New Mexico & Beyond. Documents posted on June 6, 2012 by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) allege that although the Petroglyph National Monument is a valuable resource and location for the City of Albuquerque and the state of New Mexico, the historical resources contained within is in danger because of the City and the National Park Service (NPS) inability manage up to two-thirds of the monument that is City-owned land. In their opinion, there are no persistent standards or patrols protecting the petroglyphs or the surrounding areas. Under a five-year Cooperative Management Agreement, National Park Service and the City specify the delegation of their respective responsibilities for the monument. The City, however, refuses to allow NPS rangers to patrol or enforce Park Service rules on City lands, which constitute the bulk of the monument. Due to City service cutbacks, most of the Petroglyph is left unpatrolled. In a July 25, 2011 letter to PEER, NPS Intermountain Regional Director John Wessels stated ‚Äì Southwest PEER Director Daniel Patterson said \\"It is a disgrace that ancient rock art is obscured by both years of debris and last weekend's vandalism ... Petroglyph is not just a regional but a national treasure which deserves the same protections as other national parks.\\"Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility Petroglyph National Monument Press Release The 2008 Cooperative Management Agreement must be renewed by May 2013. PEER has launched a citizen petition and national campaign to persuade Albuquerque Mayor Richard J. Berry to allow NPS to provide full monument protection in the upcoming cooperative management pact.

It is located at Nagatach≈ç 1-chome 7‚Äì1, Chiyoda, Tokyo. Sessions of the House of Representatives take place in the left wing and sessions of the House of Councillors in the right wing. The Diet Building was completed in 1936 and is constructed out of purely Japanese materials, with the exception of the stained glass, door locks, and pneumatic tube system. History The construction of the building for the old Imperial Diet began in 1920; however, plans for the building date back to the late 1880s. The Diet met in temporary structures for the first fifty years of its existence because there was no agreement over what form its building should take. =Early designs= German architects Wilhelm B√∂ckmann and Hermann Ende were invited to Tokyo in 1886 and 1887, respectively. They drew up two plans for a Diet building. B√∂ckmann's initial plan was a masonry structure with a dome and flanking wings, similar to other legislatures of the era, which would form the core of a large \\"government ring\\" south of the Imperial Palace. However, at the time there was public resistance in Japan to Foreign Minister Inoue Kaoru's internationalist policies, and so the architects submitted a more \\"Japanese\\" design as well, substituting traditional Japanese architectural features for many parts of the building. Ende and B√∂ckmann's Diet Building was never built, but their other \\"government ring\\" designs were used for the Tokyo District Court and Ministry of Justice buildings. In 1898, Prime Minister It≈ç Hirobumi interviewed American Ralph Adams Cram, who proposed a more \\"Oriental\\" design for the building, featuring tiled roofs and a large enclosure of walls and gates. The It≈ç government fell as Cram was en route to the United States, and the project was dropped. = First building, second building, and fires at both = With an internal deadline approaching, the government enlisted Ende and B√∂ckmann associate Adolph Stegmueller and Japanese architect Yoshii Shigenori to design a temporary structure. The building, a two-story, European-style wooden structure, opened in November 1890 on a site in Hibiya. An electrical fire burned down the first building in January 1891, only two months later. Another Ende and B√∂ckmann associate, Oscar Tietze, joined Yoshii to design its replacement. The second building was larger than the first, but followed a similar design: it housed the Diet until 1925 when another fire destroyed the building.Watanabe, Hiroshi. The Architecture of Tokyo: An Architectural History in 571 Individual Presentations, p. 111 (2001). File:The First Japnese Diet Hall 1890-91.jpgFirst building File:The Second Japnese Diet Hall 1891-1925.jpgSecond building = Current Diet Building = In 1910, the Finance Ministry started a commission in an attempt to take control over the new Diet Building design from the Home Ministry. Prime Minister Katsura Tar≈ç chaired the commission, which recommended that the new building emulate an Italian Renaissance architectural style. This recommendation was criticized by many who thought that choice to be too arbitrary. The ministry sponsored a public design competition in 1918, and 118 designs were submitted for the new building. The first prize winner, Watanabe Fukuzo, produced a design similar to Ende and B√∂ckmann's. The Diet Building was eventually constructed between 1920 and 1936 National Diet Building ‚Äì International Database for Civil and Structural Engineering with a floor plan based on Fukuzo's entry. The roof and tower of the building might have been inspired by another entrant, third prize winner Takeuchi Shinshichi, and are believed to have been chosen because they reflected a more modern hybrid architecture than the purely European and East Asian designs proposed by other architects. While the actual source for the \\"Pyramid\\" roof remains unclear, Japanese historian Jonathan Reynolds suggests it was \\"probably borrowed\\" from Shinshichi although an image of the entry is not provided but instead he thanks fellow historian of Africa studies at Columbia, Zoe Strother, for mentioning that Shinshichi's design resembles the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, which was a model for some prominent Western designs in the early 1900s, such as John Russell Pope's 1911 award-winning House of the Temple in Washington, D.C. and the downtown Los Angeles City Hall, completed in 1928.

Main facilities in the National Diet Building  National Diet Building and skyscrapers The building assigns jurisdiction over the central entrance, the central hall, Gokyusho (emperor's resting space), and the central tower to the House of Councilors (Upper House), the front courtyard to the House of Representatives (Lower House), and the National Diet Library suboffice on the 4th floor of the central tower to the National Diet Library. = Central entrance = The central entrance stands behind the main gate and below the central tower. It is characterized by the wide driveway and the entrance doors that are made of bronze and each measure 3.94 meters in height, 1.09 meters in width, and 1.125 tons in weight. These doors for the central entrance, the separate entrance doors for each House building, and the bronze doors inside the building were outsourced to and built by Tokyo School of Fine Arts (currently Tokyo University of the Arts). The central entrance is not for daily use to enter and exit the Diet building and is called ‚Äúthe door that never opens‚Äù because of its restricted access. The entrance is used when Diet members attend their first session after a House of Representatives general election or a House of Councilors regular election and when welcoming the Emperor or foreign heads of state into the Diet building. It is also used to allow visitors into the building in open house events. = Central hall = National Diet Building Central Hall Central stairwell The lobby behind the central entrance and right below the central tower is what is called the central hall. The hall has a stairwell that reaches from the 2nd floor to the 6th floor and a ceiling that is 32.62 meters high. The ceiling is made of stained glass and has four oil paintings of Japan's four seasons in the four corners of the ceiling. The paintings each depict Mount Yoshino in the spring, Lake Towada in the summer, Okunikko in the fall, and the Japan Alps in the winter. They were drawn not by famous artists but by art students. In the four corners of the central hall, there are statues of Itagaki Taisuke, Okuma Shigenobu, and Ito Hirobumi who were instrumental in establishing constitutional government in Japan, and an empty pedestal. It is not clear why there is an empty pedestal. Some claim original designers could not reach consensus on whose statue to build, or that it encapsulated the idea that politics is never complete. Others say designers left it open to urge politicians today to outstrip the three grand predecessors, or that they avoided building a statue with its back to the Imperial palace. The empty pedestal is displayed with a big pine bonsai on the first day of the Diet session. = Central tower = The central tower measures 65.45 meters in height, and surpassed Mitsukoshi‚Äôs main store (60.61 meters) which was the tallest building at the time the Diet building was constructed. It remained the tallest building in Japan until Hotel New Otani‚Äôs main building (73 meters) was built in 1964. Inside the pyramid-shaped dome is a large hall, from the center of which a spiral staircase leads up to the observatory on the top floor of the tower. The 7 square meters-large observatory is said to have offered a panoramic view over Tokyo, but both the observatory and the hall are closed today and do not allow anybody other than the building manager, even Diet members, to enter without permission. The fourth floor of the central tower is a suboffice of the National Diet Library and can be used freely by anyone affiliated with the Diet. The fourth floor does not have a restroom because it would be situated above the restroom designated for the Emperor, located nearby Gokyusho (as described later). In September 2003, the central tower was hit by a lightning, and the granite stone at the top of the tower ruptured, breaking the stained glass beneath. Employees of Kajima Corporation who happened to be present at the scene to fix a restroom requested help from their own company which ended up being in charge of the repair work of the tower. The ruptured granite stone is currently owned by Tohoku University and the Kiseki Museum of World Stones in Fujinomiya, Shizuoka. = Goky≈´sh≈ç = The Goky≈´sh≈ç (Âæ°‰ºëÊâÄ) was originally referred to as Gobinden (Âæ°‰æøÊÆø) and was built as a place for the Emperor to rest upon his visit to the Diet to attend events like the opening and closing ceremonies. The chamber is located at the top of the main stairway covered with a red carpet that leads from the central hall. The ‚ÄúL‚Äù shaped desk for the Emperor is a remnant from the pre-war era when the Emperor dressed in military uniform and needed a place for his hat. In this room, the Emperor receives courtesy visits from chairmen and vice chairmen of both Houses before attending the opening ceremony in the Chamber of the House of Councilors. Supposedly with ten percent of the entire construction cost spent on this room, Goky≈´sh≈ç is entirely made of cypress coated with Japanese lacquer, and adornments above the outside of the room are made from cuckoo, a type of stone extracted in Anan, Tokushima. The materials and decorations used for this room are particularly rich in craftsmanship and glamour among all the rooms in the Diet building. The chandelier is made of crystal. A private restroom for the Emperor stands close to Goky≈´sh≈ç and has both western and Japanese style toilets. When the Emperor travels between the Imperial Palace and the Diet, he is escorted by police motorcade, police cars, and an open limousine accompanied by Imperial Palace guards and law enforcement officials from the Tokyo police department. Diet guards put on white ceremonial robes in the summer and black robes in the winter on the day of the Emperor's visit. It is said that Mount Fuji could be viewed from the windows of Goky≈´sh≈ç before office buildings blocked the view. Much of the interiors of the Diet building are designed by Naigai Technos Co. = Chambers of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors= House of Councillors House of Representatives These large halls are usually called the ‚Äúmain chambers‚Äù and are located on the 2nd floor of each House building with a ceiling that opens up to the 3rd floor. The ceiling is partly made from stained glass which lets in sunlight, so the ceiling lights are kept turned off unless there is a plenary assembly in the chamber. The floor is structured in the so-called ‚Äúcontinental‚Äù fashion; the floor forms a fan shape with the chairman and the podium at its center, and member seats are allotted to each parliamentary group in accordance to their size. The chairman sits in the center accompanied by the secretary general on his right. The podium stands in front of the chairman's seat, and the stenographer sits beneath the podium. Two rows of seats stretch on both sides of the chair, the front row for cabinet members (the seat closest to the chairman is for the Prime Minister) and the back row for the Diet administrative staffs. The Diet members‚Äô seats are designated by the chairman at the beginning of a Diet session but can be switched during a session if necessary. The House of Representatives makes it a custom to allocate larger parliamentary groups to the chairman's right. In other words, the majority party will sit on the furthest right to the chairman followed by the second largest party, and independents sit in the far left. In the House of Councillors, by contrast, the largest parliamentary group sits in the center with smaller groups on either side. Within a parliamentary group, members who have been elected the fewest times are seated in the front rows closest to the chairman, while those with a longer record as politicians sit in the back rows. Each seat has a number and a name plate with white letters in a black background. The House of Councillors. Name plates are erected when in attendance. In the House of Councillors, the Emperor's throne is at the top of the stairs behind the chairman's seat which will be removed in preparation for the opening ceremony. As a legacy of the historic custom to invite the Emperor to the Chamber of the House of Peers in the opening ceremony of the Imperial Diet, even today the opening ceremonies invite the Emperor to the Chamber of the House of Councillors, a successor of the House of Peers, where the Emperor makes his opening statement from his throne. In the Chamber of the House of Councillors, the microphones are only for the chairman and the podium, while in the Chamber of the House of Representatives, they are also given to the secretary general who report voting results and the Diet member in charge of making procedural motions. There are currently 242 members of the House of Councillors but 460 seats in the Chamber as members of the House of Representatives also attend the opening ceremony held at the Chamber. The number of seats, however, is still not enough to accommodate the entire 722 members of the Diet, so at the opening ceremony Diet members are sometimes seen standing in the aisles or space in the back of the floor. Both Chambers prohibit Diet members from entering without a jacket and a member badge based on precedent (identification cards are accepted since 2005). No exceptions are allowed to this rule; then-Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda once attempted to enter the Chamber while forgetting to wear his badge and was halted by the guards, the situation of which was resolved when Fukuda hastily borrowed a member badge from a nearby Diet member, Yoshiro Mori. Parenthetically, either House restricts its members from wearing hats, coats, scarfs, or carrying umbrellas or walking sticks without permission from the chairman. Smoking is also prohibited. Diet members are also forbidden to read newspapers and literatures other than reference materials. = Public gallery = Above the back end of the Chamber is a public gallery. The public gallery is physically a part of the Chamber but is considered a different jurisdiction under the Diet internal regulations. According to those rules, visitors to the public gallery are forbidden from entering the Chamber. The public gallery in the House of Representatives is divided into seats for VIPs, diplomats, members of the House of Councillors, government officials, the general public and journalists. The public gallery in the House of Councillors accommodates the imperial family, VIPs, foreign diplomats, members of the House of Representatives, government officials, the general public and journalists. The general public seats are partly assigned to guests invited by a Diet member with the rest open to visitors on a first-come-first-served basis. Those who visit the public gallery must present their admission tickets, but newspaper and news service reporters are given a pass valid for an entire Diet session. The public gallery must follow internal statutes mandated by the chairman, and the chairman retains the authority to command the guards and law enforcement officials to maintain order in the public gallery. = Committees = The largest committee room in each House is Committee Room Number 1 which is widely known for its live broadcasts and where the budget committee, key special committees and political party debates are hosted. Summoning of sworn and unsworn witnesses also takes place in this room.

The park is located in northwestern New Mexico, between Albuquerque and Farmington, in a remote canyon cut by the Chaco Wash. Containing the most sweeping collection of ancient ruins north of Mexico, the park preserves one of the most important pre-Columbian cultural and historical areas in the United States. Between AD 900 and 1150, Chaco Canyon was a major center of culture for the Ancestral Puebloans. Chacoans quarried sandstone blocks and hauled timber from great distances, assembling fifteen major complexes that remained the largest buildings ever built in North America until the 19th century. Evidence of archaeoastronomy at Chaco has been proposed, with the \\"Sun Dagger\\" petroglyph at Fajada Butte a popular example. Many Chacoan buildings may have been aligned to capture the solar and lunar cycles, requiring generations of astronomical observations and centuries of skillfully coordinated construction. Climate change is thought to have led to the emigration of Chacoans and the eventual abandonment of the canyon, beginning with a fifty- year drought commencing in 1130. Comprising a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the arid and sparsely populated Four Corners region, the Chacoan cultural sites are fragile ‚Äì concerns of erosion caused by tourists have led to the closure of Fajada Butte to the public. The sites are considered sacred ancestral homelands by the Hopi and Pueblo people, who maintain oral accounts of their historical migration from Chaco and their spiritual relationship to the land. Though park preservation efforts can conflict with native religious beliefs, tribal representatives work closely with the National Park Service to share their knowledge and respect the heritage of the Chacoan culture. The park is on the Trails of the Ancients Byway, one of the designated New Mexico Scenic Byways.Trail of the Ancients. New Mexico Tourism Department. Retrieved August 14, 2014. Geography Chaco Canyon lies within the San Juan Basin, atop the vast Colorado Plateau, surrounded by the Chuska Mountains to the west, the San Juan Mountains to the north, and the San Pedro Mountains to the east. Ancient Chacoans drew upon dense forests of oak, pi√±on, ponderosa pine, and juniper to obtain timber and other resources. The canyon itself, located within lowlands circumscribed by dune fields, ridges, and mountains, is aligned along a roughly northwest-to-southeast axis and is rimmed by flat massifs known as mesas. Large gaps between the southwestern cliff faces‚Äîside canyons known as rincons‚Äîwere critical in funneling rain-bearing storms into the canyon and boosting local precipitation levels. The principal Chacoan complexes, such as Pueblo Bonito, Nuevo Alto, and Kin Kletso, have elevations of . The alluvial canyon floor slopes downward to the northwest at a gentle grade of per mile (6meters per kilometer); it is bisected by the Chaco Wash, an arroyo that rarely bears water. The canyon's main aquifers were too deep to be of use to ancient Chacoans: only several smaller and shallower sources supported the small springs that sustained them. Today, aside from occasional storm runoff coursing through arroyos, substantial surface water‚Äîsprings, pools, wells‚Äîis virtually nonexistent. Geology Summer thunderstorms over Fajada Butte and the Fajada Gap, near the southwestern rim of Chaco Canyon After the Pangaean supercontinent sundered during the Cretaceous period, the region became part of a shifting transition zone between a shallow inland sea‚Äîthe Western Interior Seaway‚Äîand a band of plains and low hills to the west. A sandy and swampy coastline oscillated east and west, alternately submerging and uncovering the area atop the present Colorado Plateau that Chaco Canyon now occupies. The Chaco Wash flowed across the upper strata of what is now the Chacra Mesa, cutting into it and gouging out a broad canyon over the course of millions of years. The mesa comprises sandstone and shale formations dating from the Late Cretaceous, which are of the Mesa Verde formation. The canyon bottomlands were further eroded, exposing Menefee Shale bedrock; this was subsequently buried under roughly of sediment. The canyon and mesa lie within the \\"Chaco Core\\"‚Äîwhich is distinct from the wider Chaco Plateau, a flat region of grassland with infrequent stands of timber. As the Continental Divide is only east of the canyon, geological characteristics and different patterns of drainage differentiate these two regions both from each other and from the nearby Chaco Slope, the Gobernador Slope, and the Chuska Valley. Climate Fajada Butte: Chaco averages three or four snowstorms a winter. An arid region of high xeric scrubland and desert steppe, the canyon and wider basin average of rainfall annually; the park averages . Chaco Canyon lies on the leeward side of extensive mountain ranges to the south and west, resulting in a rainshadow effect that fosters the prevailing lack of moisture in the region. The region sees four distinct seasons. Rainfall is most likely between July and September, while May and June are the driest months. Orographic precipitation, which results from moisture wrung out of storm systems ascending the mountain ranges around Chaco Canyon, is responsible for most of the summer and winter precipitation, and rainfall increases with higher elevation. Occasional aberrant northward excursions of the intertropical convergence zone may boost precipitation in some years. Chaco endures remarkable climatic extremes: temperatures range between , and may swing 60¬∞F (33¬∞C) in a single day. The region averages fewer than 150frost- free days per year, and the local climate swings wildly from years of plentiful rainfall to prolonged drought. The heavy influence of the El Ni√±o- Southern Oscillation contributes to the canyon's fickle climate. Flora and fauna Chacoan flora typifies that of North American high deserts: sagebrush and several species of cactus are interspersed with dry scrub forests of pi√±on and juniper, the latter primarily on the mesa tops. The canyon is far drier than other parts of New Mexico located at similar latitudes and elevations, and it lacks the temperate coniferous forests plentiful to the east. The prevailing sparseness of plants and wildlife was echoed in ancient times, when overpopulation, expanding cultivation, overhunting, habitat destruction, and drought may have led the Chacoans to strip the canyon of wild plants and game. It has been suggested that even during wet periods the canyon was able to sustain only 2,000 people. Among Chacoan mammals are the plentiful coyote (Canis latrans); mule deer, elk, and pronghorn also live within the canyon, though they are rarely encountered by visitors. Important smaller carnivores include bobcats, badgers, foxes, and two species of skunk. The park hosts abundant populations of rodents, including several prairie dog towns. Small colonies of bats are present during the summer. The local shortage of water means that relatively few bird species are present; these include roadrunners, large hawks (such as Cooper's hawks and American kestrels), owls, vultures, and ravens, though they are less abundant in the canyon than in the wetter mountain ranges to the east. Sizeable populations of smaller birds, including warblers, sparrows, and house finches, are also common. Three species of hummingbirds are present: one is the tiny but highly pugnacious rufous hummingbird, which compete intensely with the more mild-tempered black-chinned hummingbirds for breeding habitat in shrubs or trees located near water. Western (prairie) rattlesnakes are occasionally seen in the backcountry, though various lizards and skinks are far more abundant. History =Archaic‚ÄìEarly Basketmakers= The first people in the San Juan Basin were hunter-gatherers: the Archaic‚ÄìEarly Basketmaker people. These small bands descended from nomadic Clovis big-game hunters who arrived in the Southwest around 10,000 BC. More than 70 campsites from this period, carbon-dated to the period 7000‚Äì1500 BC and mostly consisting of stone chips and other leavings, were found in Atlatl Cave and elsewhere within Chaco Canyon, with at least one of the sites located on the canyon floor near an exposed arroyo. The Archaic‚ÄìEarly Basketmaker people were nomadic or semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who over time began making baskets to store gathered plants. By the end of the period, some people cultivated food. Excavation of their campsites and rock shelters has revealed that they made tools, gathered wild plants, and killed and processed game. Slab-lined storage cists indicate a change from a wholly nomadic lifestyle. =Ancestral Puebloans= By 900 BC, Archaic people lived at Atlatl Cave and like sites. They left little evidence of their presence in Chaco Canyon. By AD 490, their descendants, of the Late Basketmaker II Era, farmed lands around Shabik'eshchee Village and other pit-house settlements at Chaco. A small population of Basketmakers remained in the Chaco Canyon area. The broad arc of their cultural elaboration culminated around 800, during the Pueblo I Era, when they were building crescent-shaped stone complexes, each comprising four to five residential suites abutting subterranean kivas, large enclosed areas reserved for rites. Such structures characterize the Early Pueblo People. By 850, the Ancient Pueblo population‚Äîthe \\"Anasazi\\", from a Ute term adopted by the Navajo denoting the \\"ancient ones\\" or \\"enemy ancestors\\"‚Äîhad rapidly expanded: groups resided in larger, more densely populated pueblos. Strong evidence attests to a canyon-wide turquoise processing and trading industry dating from the 10th century. Around then, the first section of Pueblo Bonito was built: a curved row of 50 rooms near its present north wall. Archaeogenomic analysis of the mitochondria of nine skeletons from high-status graves in Pueblo Bonito determined that members of an elite matriline were interred here for approximately 330 years between 800 and 1130, suggesting continuity with the matrilineal succession practices of many Pueblo nations today. The cohesive Chacoan system began unravelling around 1140, perhaps triggered by an extreme fifty-year drought that began in 1130; chronic climatic instability, including a series of severe droughts, again struck the region between 1250 and 1450. Poor water management led to arroyo cutting; deforestation was extensive and economically devastating: timber for construction had to be hauled instead from outlying mountain ranges such as the Chuska mountains, which are more than to the west. Outlying communities began to depopulate and, by the end of the century, the buildings in the central canyon had been neatly sealed and abandoned. Some scholars suggest that violence and warfare, perhaps involving cannibalism, impelled the evacuations. Hints of such include dismembered bodies‚Äîdating from Chacoan times‚Äîfound at two sites within the central canyon. Yet Chacoan complexes showed little evidence of being defended or defensively sited high on cliff faces or atop mesas. Only several minor sites at Chaco have evidence of the large-scale burning that would suggest enemy raids. Archaeological and cultural evidence leads scientists to believe people from this region migrated south, east, and west into the valleys and drainages of the Little Colorado River, the Rio Puerco, and the Rio Grande. Anthropologist Joseph Tainter deals at length with the structure and decline of Chaco civilization in his 1988 study The Collapse of Complex Societies. =Athabaskan succession= Prehistoric roads and great houses in the San Juan Basin, superimposed on a map showing modern roads and settlements Numic-speaking peoples, such as the Ute and Shoshone, were present on the Colorado Plateau beginning in the 12th century. Nomadic Southern Athabaskan-speaking peoples, such as the Apache and Navajo, succeeded the Pueblo people in this region by the 15th century. In the process, they acquired Chacoan customs and agricultural skills. Ute tribal groups also frequented the region, primarily during hunting and raiding expeditions. The modern Navajo Nation lies west of Chaco Canyon, and many Navajo live in surrounding areas. =Excavation and protection= The first documented trip through Chaco Canyon was an 1823 expedition led by New Mexican governor Jos√© Antonio Vizcarra when the area was under Mexican rule. He noted several large ruins in the canyon. The American trader Josiah Gregg wrote about the ruins of Chaco Canyon, referring in 1832 to Pueblo Bonito as \\"built of fine-grit sandstone\\". In 1849, a U.S. Army detachment passed through and surveyed the ruins, following United States acquisition of the Southwest with its victory in the Mexican War in 1848. The canyon was so remote, however, that it was scarcely visited over the next 50 years. After brief reconnaissance work by Smithsonian scholars in the 1870s, formal archaeological work began in 1896 when a party from the American Museum of Natural History based in New York City ‚Äîthe Hyde Exploring Expedition‚Äîbegan excavating Pueblo Bonito. Spending five summers in the region, they sent over 60,000 artifacts back to New York and operated a series of trading posts in the area. In 1901 Richard Wetherill, who had worked for the Hyde expedition, claimed a homestead of that included Pueblo Bonito, Pueblo del Arroyo, and Chetro Ketl. While investigating Wetherill's land claim, federal land agent Samuel J. Holsinger detailed the physical setting of the canyon and the sites, noted prehistoric road segments and stairways above Chetro Ketl, and documented prehistoric dams and irrigation systems. His report went unpublished and unheeded. It urged the creation of a national park to safeguard Chacoan sites. The next year, Edgar Lee Hewett, president of New Mexico Normal University (later renamed New Mexico Highlands University), mapped many Chacoan sites. Hewett and others helped enact the Federal Antiquities Act of 1906, the first U.S. law to protect relics; it was, in effect, a direct consequence of Wetherill's controversial activities at Chaco. The Act also authorized the President to establish national monuments: on March 11, 1907, Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed Chaco Canyon National Monument. Wetherill relinquished his land claims. A ceramic bowl excavated from Pueblo Alto, dating from AD 1030 to 1200 In 1920, the National Geographic Society began an archaeological examination of Chaco Canyon and appointed Neil Judd, then 32, to head the project. After a reconnaissance trip that year, Judd proposed to excavate Pueblo Bonito, the largest ruin at Chaco. Beginning in 1921, Judd spent seven field seasons at Chaco. Living and working conditions were spartan at best. In his memoirs, Judd noted dryly that \\"Chaco Canyon has its limitations as a summer resort\\". By 1925, Judd's excavators had removed 100,000 short tons of overburden, using a team of \\"35 or more Indians, ten white men, and eight or nine horses\\". Judd's team found only 69 hearths in the ruin, a puzzling discovery as winters are cold at Chaco. Judd sent A. E. Douglass more than 90 specimens for tree-ring dating, then in its infancy. At that time, Douglass had only a \\"floating\\" chronology. it was not until 1929 that a Judd-led team found the \\"missing link\\". Most of the beams used at Chaco were cut between 1033 and 1092, the height of construction there. In 1949, the University of New Mexico deeded over adjoining lands to form an expanded Chaco Canyon National Monument. In return, the university maintained scientific research rights to the area. By 1959, the National Park Service had constructed a park visitor center, staff housing, and campgrounds. As a historic property of the National Park Service, the National Monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. In 1971, researchers Robert Lister and James Judge established the \\"Chaco Center,\\" a division for cultural research that functioned as a joint project between the University of New Mexico and the National Park Service. A number of multi-disciplinary research projects, archaeological surveys, and limited excavations began during this time. The Chaco Center extensively surveyed the Chacoan roads, well-constructed and strongly reinforced thoroughfares radiating from the central canyon. The richness of the cultural remains at park sites led to the expansion of the small National Monument into the Chaco Culture National Historical Park on December 19, 1980, when an additional were added to the protected area. In 1987, the park was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. To safeguard Chacoan sites on adjacent Bureau of Land Management and Navajo Nation lands, the Park Service developed the multi- agency Chaco Culture Archaeological Protection Site program. These initiatives have identified more than 2,400 archeological sites within the current park's boundaries; only a small percentage of these have been excavated. Management Major Chacoan sites within park margins Aerial park overview Chaco Culture National Historical Park is managed by the National Park Service, a federal agency within the Department of the Interior; neighboring federal lands hosting Chacoan roads are controlled by the Bureau of Land Management. In the 2002‚Äì03 fiscal year, the park's total annual operating budget was $1.434 million. The park has a visitor center, which features the \\"Chaco Collection Museum\\", an information desk, a theater, a book store, and a gift shop. Prior to the 1980s, archeological excavations within current park boundaries were intensive: compound walls were dismantled or demolished, and thousands of artifacts were extracted. Starting in 1981, a new approach, informed by traditional Hopi and Pueblo beliefs, stopped such intrusions. Remote sensing, anthropological study of Indian oral traditions, and dendrochronology‚Äîwhich left Chacoan relics undisturbed‚Äîwere pursued. In this vein, the \\"Chaco American Indian Consultation Committee\\" was established in 1991 to give Navajo, Hopi, Pueblo, and other Indian representatives a voice in park oversight. Current park policy mandates partial restoration of excavated sites. \\"Backfilling\\", or re-burying excavated sites with sand, is one such means. Other measures attempt to safeguard the area's ancient ambiance and mystique, such as the \\"Chaco Night Sky Program\\", which seeks to eliminate the effect of light pollution on the park's acclaimed night skies; under the program, some 14,000 visitors make use of the Chaco Observatory (inaugurated in 1998), park telescopes, and astronomy-related programs. The park was named a Gold-tier Dark Sky Park by the International Dark-Sky Association in 2013. Chacoan relics outside the current park's boundaries have been threatened by development: an example was the proposed competitive leasing of federal lands in the San Juan Basin for surface coal mining beginning in 1983. As ample coal deposits abut the park, this strip mining threatened the web of ancient Chacoan roads. The year-long \\"Chaco Roads Project\\" thus documented the roads, which were later protected from mining. Sites The Chacoans built their complexes along a stretch of canyon floor, with the walls of some structures aligned cardinally and others aligned with the 18.6-year cycle of minimum and maximum moonrise and moonset. =Central canyon= NPS site maps of the major ruins of Chaco Canyon The central portion of the canyon contains the largest Chacoan complexes. The most studied is Pueblo Bonito. Covering almost and comprising at least 650 rooms, it is the largest great house; in parts of the complex, the structure was four stories high. The builders' use of core-and- veneer architecture and multi-story construction necessitated massive masonry walls up to thick. Pueblo Bonito is divided into two sections by a wall precisely aligned to run north-south, bisecting the central plaza. A great kiva was placed on either side of the wall, creating a symmetrical pattern common to many Chacoan great houses. The scale of the complex, upon completion, rivaled that of the Colosseum. Nearby is Pueblo del Arroyo, which was founded between AD 1050 and 1075 and completed in the early 12th century; it sits at a drainage outlet known as South Gap. Pueblo Bonito, largest of the great houses, abuts the foot of Chaco Canyon's northern rim. Aerial view of Pueblo Bonito Casa Rinconada, isolated from the other central sites, sits to the south side of Chaco Wash, adjacent to a Chacoan road leading to a set of steep stairs that reached the top of Chacra Mesa. Its sole kiva stands alone, with no residential or support structures whatsoever; it did once have a passageway leading from the underground kiva to several above-ground levels. Chetro Ketl, located near Pueblo Bonito, bears the typical 'D'-shape of many other central complexes. Begun between 1020 and 1050, its 450‚Äì550 rooms shared one great kiva. Experts estimate that it took 29,135man-hours to erect Chetro Ketl alone; Hewett estimated that it took the wood of 5,000 trees and 50 million stone blocks. Kin Kletso (\\"Yellow House\\") was a medium-sized complex located west of Pueblo Bonito. It shows strong evidence of construction and occupation by Pueblo peoples from the northern San Juan Basin. Its rectangular shape and design is related to the Pueblo II cultural group, rather than the Pueblo III style or its Chacoan variant. It contains 55 rooms, four ground- floor kivas, and a two-story cylindrical tower that may have functioned as a kiva or religious center. Evidence of an obsidian-processing industry was discovered near the village, which was erected between 1125 and 1130. Chaco's smaller kivas numbered around 100, each hosting rituals for 50‚Äì100 worshipers; the 15 much larger \\"great kivas\\" each held up to 400. Pueblo Alto is a great house of 89 rooms located on a mesa top near the middle of Chaco Canyon, from Pueblo Bonito; it was begun between AD 1020 and 1050 during a wider building boom throughout the canyon. Its location made the community visible to most of the inhabitants of the San Juan Basin; indeed, it was only north of Tsin Kletzin, on the opposite side of the canyon. The community was the center of a bead- and turquoise-processing industry that influenced the development of all villages in the canyon; chert tool production was common. Research at the site conducted by archaeologist Tom Windes suggests only a handful of families, perhaps as few as five to twenty, lived in the complex; this may imply that Pueblo Alto served a primarily non-residential role. Another great house, Nuevo Alto, was built on the north mesa near Pueblo Alto; it was founded in the late 12th century, a time when the Chacoan population was declining. =Outliers= Another cluster of great houses lies in Chaco's northern reaches; among the largest is Casa Chiquita (\\"Small House\\"), a village built in the 1080s, when, in a period of ample rainfall, Chacoan culture was expanding. Its layout featured a smaller, squarer profile; it also lacked the open plazas and separate kivas of its predecessors. Larger, squarer blocks of stone were used in the masonry; kivas were designed in the northern Mesa Verdean tradition. Two miles down the canyon is Pe√±asco Blanco (\\"White Bluff\\"), an arc-shaped compound built atop the canyon's southern rim in five distinct stages between 900 and 1125. A nearby cliff painting (the \\"Supernova Platograph\\") may record the sighting of the SN 1054 supernova on July 5, 1054. Hungo Pavi, near the center of Chaco Canyon. A staircase leads out of the complex. Hungo Pavi, located from Una Vida, measured in circumference. Initial probes revealed 72 ground-level rooms, with structures reaching four stories in height; one large circular kiva has been identified. Kin Nahasbas, built in either the 9th or 10th century, is sited slightly north of Una Vida, positioned at the foot of the north mesa. Limited excavation of it has taken place. Tsin Kletzin (\\"Charcoal Place\\"), a compound located on the Chacra Mesa and positioned above Casa Rinconada, is due south of Pueblo Alto, on the opposite side of the canyon. Nearby is Weritos Dam, a massive earthen structure that scientists believe provided Tsin Kletzin with all of its domestic water. The dam worked by retaining stormwater runoff in a reservoir. Massive amounts of silt accumulated during flash floods would have forced the residents to regularly rebuild the dam and dredge the catchment area. Interior of Wijiji, an outlier site occupied between AD 1100 and 1150 Deeper in the canyon, Una Vida (\\"One Life\\") is one of the three oldest great houses; construction began around 900. Comprising at least two stories and 124 rooms, it shares an arc or \\"D\\"-shaped design with its contemporaries, Pe√±asco Blanco and Pueblo Bonito, but has a unique \\"dog leg\\" addition made necessary by topography. It is located in one of the canyon's major side drainages, near Gallo Wash, and was massively expanded after 930. Wijiji (\\"black greasewood\\"), comprising just over one hundred rooms, is the smallest of the great houses. Built between 1110 and 1115, it was the last Chacoan great house to be constructed. Somewhat isolated within the narrow wash, it is positioned from neighboring Una Vida. Directly north are communities even more remote: Salmon Ruins and Aztec Ruins, sited on the San Juan and Animas Rivers near Farmington, were built during a thirty-year wet period commencing in 1100. Some directly south of Chaco Canyon, on the Great South Road, lies another cluster of outlying communities. The largest, Kin Nizhoni, stands atop a mesa surrounded by marshy bottomlands. Casamero Pueblo is located on McKinley County Road 19, near Tecolote Mesa, a red sandstone mesa. It was connected to its nearby outlier, Andrews Ranch, by a Chacoan road.Casamero Pueblo. Bureau of Land Management. Retrieved August 15, 2014. Chaco Canyon, Aztec Ruins, Salmon Ruins, and Casamero Pueblo are on the Trail of the Ancients Scenic Byway. Ruins =Great houses= Doorways, Pueblo Bonito Immense complexes known as \\"great houses\\" embodied worship at Chaco. The Chacoans used masonry techniques unique for their time, and their building constructions lasted decades and even centuries. As architectural forms evolved and centuries passed, the houses kept several core traits. Most apparent is their sheer bulk; complexes averaged more than 200 rooms each, and some enclosed up to 700 rooms. Individual rooms were substantial in size, with higher ceilings than Anasazi works of preceding periods. They were well-planned: vast sections or wings erected were finished in a single stage, rather than in increments. Houses generally faced the south, and plaza areas were almost always girt with edifices of sealed-off rooms or high walls. Houses often stood four or five stories tall, with single-story rooms facing the plaza; room blocks were terraced to allow the tallest sections to compose the pueblo's rear edifice. Rooms were often organized into suites, with front rooms larger than rear, interior, and storage rooms or areas. Ceremonial structures known as kivas were built in proportion to the number of rooms in a pueblo. One small kiva was built for roughly every 29 rooms. Nine complexes each hosted an oversized great kiva, each up to in diameter. \\"T\\"-shaped doorways and stone lintels marked all Chacoan kivas. Though simple and compound walls were often used, great houses were primarily constructed of core-and-veneer walls: two parallel load-bearing walls comprising dressed, flat sandstone blocks bound in clay mortar were erected. Gaps between walls were packed with rubble, forming the wall's core. Walls were then covered in a veneer of small sandstone pieces, which were pressed into a layer of binding mud. These surfacing stones were often placed in distinctive patterns. The Chacoan structures altogether required the wood of 200,000 coniferous trees, mostly hauled‚Äîon foot‚Äîfrom mountain ranges up to away. =Uses= Around 200,000 pieces of turquoise have been excavated from the ruins at Chaco Canyon. These turquoise and argillite (red) beads were found at Pueblo Alto.Chaco technology at NPS The meticulously designed buildings composing the larger Chacoan complexes did not emerge until around AD 1030. The Chacoans melded pre-planned architectural designs, astronomical alignments, geometry, landscaping, and engineering into ancient urban centers of unique public architecture. Researchers have concluded that the complex may have had a relatively small residential population, with larger groups assembling only temporarily for annual ceremonies. Smaller sites, apparently more residential in character, are scattered near the great houses in and around Chaco. The canyon itself runs along one of the lunar alignment lines, suggesting the location was originally chosen for its astronomical significance. If nothing else, this allowed alignment with several other key structures in the canyon. Turquoise was very important to the people of Chaco. Around 200,000 pieces of turquoise have been excavated from the ruins at Chaco Canyon,The Turquoise Trail, by Eric A. Powell (abstract) , Archaeology Magazine, Volume 58 Number 1, January/February 2005 and workshops for local manufacture of turquoise beads have been found. The turquoise was used locally for grave goods, burials and ceremonial offerings.\\"The Organization of Turquoise Production and Consumption by the Prehistoric Chacoans\\", by Frances Joan Mathien, American Antiquity, Vol. 66, No. 1 (Jan., 2001), pp. 103-118 Over 15,000 turquoise beads and pendants accompanied two burials at Pueblo Bonito. Around this time, the extended Ancestral Puebloan (Anasazi) community experienced a population and construction boom. Throughout the 10th century, Chacoan building techniques spread from the canyon to neighboring regions. By AD 1115 at least 70 outlying pueblos of Chacoan provenance had been built within the composing the San Juan Basin. Experts speculate the function of these compounds, some large enough to be considered great houses in their own right. Some suggest they may have been more than agricultural communities, perhaps functioning as trading posts or ceremonial sites. Thirty such outliers spread across are connected to the central canyon and to one another by an enigmatic web of six Chacoan road systems. Extending up to in generally straight routes, they appear to have been extensively surveyed and engineered. Their depressed and scraped caliche beds reach wide; earthen berms or rocks, at times composing low walls, delimit their edges. When necessary, the roads deploy steep stone stairways and rock ramps to surmount cliffs and other obstacles. Though their purpose may never be certain, archaeologist Harold Gladwin noted that nearby Navajo believe that the Anasazi built the roads to transport timber; archaeologist Neil Judd offered a similar hypothesis. Archaeoastronomy =Sun Dagger= supernova of AD 1054 This supernova and the Moon were in this configuration when the supernova was near its brightest. An imprint of a hand at the top signifies that this is a sacred place.Chaco: 1054 Supernova Petrograph at National Center for Atmospheric Research Two whorl-shaped etchings near the top of Fajada Butte compose the \\"Sun Dagger\\" petroglyph, tucked behind the eponymous rock panels of the \\"Three-Slab Site\\". They are symbolically focal. It consists of two spirals ‚Äî one principal and one ancillary. The latter left-hand spiral captured both spring and fall equinoxes; its artifice was revealed by a descending spear of light, filtered through the slabs, that shone upon it and split it in two. The former and larger whorl to its right was lit by the titular \\"sun dagger\\", which bisected it through another interplay of slab and sunlight. It struck it, brilliantly, as the summer sun attains its solstice midday peak. The Chacoans were said to be marking, as artist, \\"Sun Dagger\\" discoverer, and leading proponent Anna Sofaer puts it, \\"the middle of time\\". Each turn of the 9.25-turn large spiral was found to mark one year in the 18.6-year \\"lunar excursion cycle\\" of the rising mid-winter full moon. This record is kept by a slab-cast lunar shadow whose edge strikes in succession each ring. As the full \\"minimum moon\\" closest to the winter solstice rises, the shadow's edge precisely strikes the center of the larger spiral; it steps outward year by year, ring by ring, until it strikes the outermost edge of it during the full \\"maximum moon\\", again in mid-winter. Fajada Butte bears five other petroglyphs ‚Äî including a carving of a \\"rattlesnake\\", other spirals, and a rectangle ‚Äî that are conspicuously lit by contrasts between sunbeams and shadows during equinoxes or solstices. Public access to the butte was curtailed when, in 1989, erosion from modern foot traffic was found to be responsible for one of the three screening slabs at the \\"Sun Dagger\\" site shifting out of its ancient position; the assemblage of stones has thus lost some of its former spatial and temporal precision as a solar and lunar calendar. In 1990 the screens were stabilized and placed under observation, but the wayward slab was not moved back into its original orientation. =Alignments= Casa Rinconada Some parties have advanced the theory that at least 12 of the 14 principal Chacoan complexes were sited and aligned in coordination, and that each was oriented along axes that mirrored the passing of the Sun and Moon at visually pivotal times. The first great house known to evince fastidious proportioning and alignment was Casa Rinconada: the twinned \\"T\\"-shaped portals of its radius great kiva were north-south collinear, and axes joining opposing windows passed within of its center. The great houses of Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl were found by the \\"Solstice Project\\" and the U.S. National Geodetic Survey to be sited along a precisely east-west line, an axis that captures the passage of the equinox sun. The lines perpendicularly bisecting their principal walls are aligned north-south, implying a possible intent to mirror the equinox midday. Pueblo Alto and Tsin Kletsin are also north-south aligned. These two axes form an inverted cross when viewed from above; its northbound reach is extended another past Pueblo Alto by the ramrod-straight Great North Road, a pilgrimage route that modern-day Pueblo Indians believe to be an allusion to myths surrounding their arrival from the distant north. Pueblo Pintado, an outlying Chacoan great house Two shared- latitude but diametrically opposed complexes, Pueblo Pintado and Kin Bineola, are located some from the core buildings of the central canyon. Each lies on a path from the central canyon that is collinear with the passage and setting of the full mid-winter \\"minimum moon\\", which recurs every 18.6 years. Two other complexes that are less distant from Pueblo Bonito, Una Vida and Pe√±asco Blanco, share an axis collinear with the passage of the full \\"maximum moon\\". The terms \\"minimum\\" and \\"maximum\\" refer to the azimuthal extreme points in the lunar excursion cycle, or the swings in direction relative to true north that the setting full moon exhibits. It takes roughly 9.25 years for the rising or setting full moon nearest to winter solstice to proceed from its maximum azimuthal north, or \\"maximum extremum\\", to its southernmost azimuth, known as \\"minimum extremum\\".

History The area of present-day Hiraizumi was part of ancient Mutsu Province. It was the home of the Northern Fujiwara clan for about 100 years in the late Heian era, during which time it served as the de facto capital of ≈åsh≈´, an area containing nearly a third of the Japanese land area. At its height the population of Hiraizumi reached 50,000Tertius Chandler, \\"Four Thousand Years of Urban Growth: An Historical Census\\", The Edwin Mellen Press, Lewiston (1987). or more than 100,000,Toshio Sanuki, \\"Toshi no Seisui Rankingu (Rise and Fall Ranking of Urbans)\\", Jiji Tsushin Sha, Tokyo (1996). rivaling Kyoto in size and splendor. The first structure built in Hiraizumi may have been Hakusan Shrine on top of Mount Kanzan (Barrier Mountain). A writer in 1334 recorded that the shrine was already 700 years old. Although rebuilt many times, the same shrine is still standing in the same location. In about 1100, Fujiwara no Kiyohira moved his home from Fort Toyoda in present-day Esashi, in the city of ≈åsh≈´ to Mount Kanzan in Hiraizumi. This location was significant for several reasons. Kanzan is situated at the junction of two rivers, the Kitakami and the Koromo. Traditionally the Koromo River served as the boundary between Japan to the south and the Emishi peoples to the north. By building his home south of the Koromo, Kiyohira (half Emishi himself) demonstrated his intention to rule ≈åsh≈´ without official sanction from the court in Kyoto. Kanzan was also directly on the ≈åsh≈´ Kaid≈ç, the main road leading from Kyoto to the northern lands as they opened up. Kanzan was also seen as the exact center of ≈åsh≈´ which stretched from the Shirakawa Barrier in the south to Sotogahama in present-day Aomori Prefecture. Kiyohira built the large temple complex known as Ch≈´son-ji. The first structure was a large pagoda at the very top of the mountain. In conjunction with this, he placed small umbrella reliquaries (kasa sotoba) every hundred meters along the ≈åsh≈´ kaid≈ç decorated with placards depicting Amida Buddha painted in gold. Other pagodas, temples and gardens followed including the Konjiki-d≈ç, a jewel box of a building intended to represent the Buddhist Pure Land and the final resting place of the Fujiwara lords. Hiraizumi's golden age lasted for nearly 100 years. It was destroyed in 1189,https://wordpress.com/post/matsuobashohaiku.home.blog/160 and, after the fall of the Fujiwara clan, the town sank back into relative obscurity, and most of the buildings that gave the town its cultural prominence were destroyed. When the poet Matsuo Bash≈ç saw the state of the town in 1689 he penned a famous haiku about the impermanence of human glory: :Natsukusa ya! / Tsuwamono-domo ga / yume no ato ::Ah, summer grasses! / All that remains / Of the warriors' dreams.

As an athlete, he won the bronze medal in the 10,000 metres at the 1976 Summer Olympics, and the gold medal in the 5,000 metres at the 1974 European Championships and the 10,000 metres at the 1978 Commonwealth Games. He has provided commentary and analysis on athletics, particularly long-distance events, for BBC Sport since the end of his running career. Early life Educated at St Joseph's RC Grammar School in Hebburn, the University of Sussex and Carnegie College of Physical Education, Foster returned to St Joseph's Grammar School as a chemistry teacher. His pupils included footballer turned manager Phil Brown, whom he tried to encourage to take up running over football. Athletics career Brendan Foster's athletic career saw him compete in three Olympic Games, claiming Britain its only track and field medal (bronze in the 10,000 metres) at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. In 1973 he broke the World Record for two miles at Crystal Palace with a time of 8:13.68. In 1974 he won a silver medal in the Commonwealth Games in Christchurch in a time of 13:14.6 behind Ben Jipcho before winning the European Championships 5,000m, beating Olympic champion Lasse Vir√©n en route to Gold in 13:17.2. Having built up a commanding lead before the final lap he ran it in a relatively sedate 62 seconds when the then world record was within his grasp. In the same year he broke the 3,000m World Record on his home track, Gateshead International Stadium with a time of 7:35.1. That year, Foster was awarded the BBC's prestigious Sports Personality of the Year award. He established his personal best in the 10,000 m with a time of 27:30.3 run at Crystal Palace on 23 June 1978, while also winning 10,000 m gold at the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton. Foster was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1976. Foster only placed fourth in the 1978 European Athletics Championships 10,000-metre race, but he ran faster than any 10,000-metre European Champion has run ever since (see various European countries' books about the European Athletics Championships from 1982 to 2006). Foster finished fifth in the 1976 Olympics 5,000-metre final, just 1.4 seconds behind the winner, Lasse Viren of Finland.

That record would hold through the final until it was surpassed in the final of the 1984 Olympics. Foster's final major race was the 1980 Olympics 10,000-metre final, where he finished eleventh, almost 40 seconds behind the winner, Ethiopia's Miruts Yifter. In 2010, he was inducted into the England Athletics Hall of Fame. Business, media and other activities Brendan joined the sports company Nike International Limited in 1981 as UK managing director. Progressing to European managing director, Vice-President Marketing (Worldwide) and Vice-President of Nike Europe. In 1988 he set up a company, Nova International with three friends from Nike. This company was later renamed to View From International, which won a contract to supply the British athletics team. The brand was later sold to Marks and Spencer in 2002 for an estimated ¬£2m. Since retiring from the sport after the Moscow Olympics in 1980, Foster has worked for BBC Television, commentating and reporting on Athletics at every major event since 1983. In 1977, he helped organise the \\"Gateshead Fun Run\\", a pioneering running event. In 1981, Foster founded the Great North Run, an annual half marathon from Newcastle upon Tyne to South Shields. The race became the biggest running event in the UK, and one of the biggest half marathons in the world. By 2014, the race had been run by over 1 million competitors, the first IAAF event to pass this milestone. Foster ran in the 2003 event for the first time in many years, after being challenged to do so by radio presenter Ray Stubbs. Foster has also promoted sport in Ethiopia and other African countries.

It was formerly known as Kl√∂ckner Humboldt Deutz AG, maker of the Deutz engines, so the brand commonly used was Magirus Deutz, and for a short time Kl√∂ckner. Most trucks from Magirus were also known as Magirus-Deutz. The logo of Magirus Deutz was a stylised M with a sharp, long centre point to represent the spire of Ulm Minster. Magirus is one of the largest manufacturers of fire fighting equipment. Its fire trucks are primarily based upon chassis and engines from Iveco, but occasionally also uses platforms from other truck manufacturers.  History  The company began manufacturing fire-fighting vehicles in 1866. In the late 1910s, it started the production of trucks and buses. These vehicles developed a reputation for high engineering standards, able to operate under the most arduous conditions. The company also invented the turntable ladder, as Magirus Leiter, which quickly became an essential item of fire brigade equipment worldwide. In 1975, Magirus became part of Iveco which continued producing some Magirus trucks for a short while under the name \\"Iveco Magirus\\" before abandoning it completely in most countries. KHD's collaboration with Fiat ended abruptly and less than harmoniously in 1979, leaving Fiat as owner of the Magirus-Deutz brand. However, Iveco trucks were sold under the Magirus brand in Germany and other European and Middle Eastern markets until the end of the 1980s. Today, the Magirus brand is only used for the company's firefighting equipment section, not for the whole fleet of manufactured trucks. =Airship ladders= Though seldom seen today, the Magirus company produced almost all of the early, movable ladders used in the construction of large, rigid airships in Germany and in the United States. The multi- extension, wooden ladders were mounted on massively constructed, wooden carriage frames with a \\"fifth-wheel\\" style, forward axle assembly. Although it appeared to be designed for horses, the ladders could be easily moved by two men. The carriage was equipped with four, hand screw type \\"outriggers\\" that would resist the ladder from tipping. The ladder did not swivel on the carriage. It was elevated and extended only towards the front of the carriage. In the \\"working\\" position, the ladder had to be elevated to about an 80 degree angle in order to allow full extension to 85 feet. (It is not known what the maximum extended length of the largest wooden Magirus ladder was, but the ones used during the erection of the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation's USS Akron and USS Macon reached to 85 feet.) They can be seen, commonly, in early photographs of airships under construction in the 1920s and 1930s. =In the Soviet Union= In 1974 the firm was awarded a contract (called the Delta Project) for delivery in 1975-1976 of about 9,500 dumper and flatbed trucks (Magirus –ú232 D19 and M290 D26) to the USSR to work on the construction of the Baikal‚ÄìAmur Mainline (BAM). see 1974- das \\"Delta-Projekt\\" (deutsch) This order was the largest in the company's history. These models were export only options KHD products which were not offered on the domestic market in Germany. By January 1, 1975 for the first batch of Magirus trucks for BAM construction was ready to be sent to the Soviet Union. Many of these trucks are still in service today. Largely because of this single order, in 1975 export products accounted for 70% of total production Magirus-Deutz, and the firm took the second place among the German truck manufacturers. In 1982 Magirus-Deutz erstwhile owners KHD sold the licensing rights for Soviet production of up to 25,000 Series 413 diesel engines. These were meant to be installed in heavy USSR trucks and other vehicles.

Today it is part of the city of Miyako. History The village of Tar≈ç created on April 1, 1889 within Higashihei District with the establishment of the municipality system. Higashihei merged with Kitahei and Nakahei Districts to form Shimohei District on March 29, 1896. Tar≈ç was raised to town status on April 1, 1944. On June 6, 2005, Tar≈ç, along with the village of Niisato (also from Shimohei District), was merged into the expanded city of Miyako and no longer exists as an independent municipality. In June 2005, the town had an estimated population of 4,679 and a population density of 46.3 persons per km2. The total area was 101.05 km2. The former town is located to the east of the prefectural capital Morioka and to the north of the regional center Miyako with which it has now merged. The area has a rugged coastline to the east, which is a part of Sanriku ria coast. The main local industry is commercial fishing. The town had been destroyed a number of times due to tsunami incidences all through its history. An early recorded one was in 1611, later in 1896 when 1,859 deaths were recorded, and another in 1933, when 911 people died. Due to its history of repeated destruction by tsumanis, two layers of seawalls in the form of an X-shaped structure were constructed. The seawalls had two joined sections forming seaward and landward levees, and ran to a total of long. It was known as a Banri no Chojo, Japanese for \\"Great Wall of China\\". The high seawalls were completed in 1958 after 30 years of work to protect Tar≈ç. The seawalls, which could theoretically stop breaking waves up to high, were designed to divert tsunamis to the sides around the town using channels and river dykes. Local municipal agencies regularly carried out annual tsunami drills simulating an emergency. Volunteers would close the seawall gates and residents would go to muster points above the town. The system worked well when a tsunami from the 1960 Valdivia earthquake in Chile struck the town and there was no death reported in Tar≈ç. =2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami = However, the seawalls failed when tsunami waves with height estimated to be to high struck Tar≈ç following the earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011. Survivors said they saw some residents climb on to the sea defences to watch the approaching tsunami only to be swept away when the waves went over the wall. Many in the town said they felt the wall lulled them into a false sense of security. A section of the seaside wall was swept away by the tsunami. Large amounts of concrete debris was left around Tar≈ç and scattered in its bay. 181 people were dead or missing in the tsunami, with nearly 1,700 houses damaged or destroyed. Four years after the tsunami, on 22 November 2015, a \\"town opening\\" ceremony was held in Tar≈ç after the completion of 450 new houses. The new houses were built on higher ground some 40 to 60 meters above the sea level, as well as on ground that had been raised by about 2 meters. A 14.7-metre seawall was also rebuilt by 2017. The population of the town however had dropped to 3,173, around 70 percent of the 2011 level.

Early life and career Ray Dennis Steckler was born in Reading, Pennsylvania where his grandmother, who largely raised him, nurtured his love of movies. At 15, upon receiving an 8mm home movie camera from his stepfather, Steckler shot an amateur pirate film with friends. Ray served three years in the United States Army from 1956 to 1959, being discharged as a Sergeant.Walentis, All You Can Go Home Again Reading Eagle Jun 5, 2005 He was an Army photographer,Martin, Douglas, \\"Ray Dennis Steckler, Low-Budget Auteur, Dies at 70\\", The New York Times, January 31, 2009 and served in Korea and spent a year at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Astoria, Queens with the Army Pictorial Service of the Signal Corps. In 1959, Steckler and a friend drove to Hollywood, California to enter the film industry. Steckler worked as a prop man before becoming assistant cameraman on the film, The World's Greatest Sinner, directed by and starring Timothy Carey. When the initial director of photography was fired, Steckler replaced him. Continuing to work in cinematography in the Los Angeles area, Steckler acquired a union card and established himself at major studios, including Universal Studios. When he was reportedly fired for almost knocking an A-frame onto Alfred Hitchcock, Steckler turned to the B-movie circuit. Working with Arch Hall Sr.'s Fairway Pictures, Steckler started as cinematographer and sometimes actor in the vehicles for Hall's son, Arch Hall, Jr. Steckler made his directorial debut in the Hall vehicle Wild Guitar. When Arch Hall Senior was worried whether his film would play when the original choice of the heavy was black, Steckler told his friend he had to go and took the role under his onscreen name, Cash Flagg.Quarles, p. 12 =The Incredibly Strange Creatures= In 1963 he co-produced his first solo film, The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies, co-starring his then wife, Carolyn Brandt. Filmed for a budget of $38,000,Ray Dennis Steckler official website the film was photographed by cinematographer Joseph V. Mascelli with then newcomers L√°szl√≥ Kov√°cs and Vilmos Zsigmond as camera operators; both men acknowledged the film as their first major career break. Initially distributed on the lower half of a double-bill by Fairway, Steckler took Creatures on the road himself and made it a success under a number of titles, including Diabolical Dr. Voodoo and The Teenage Psycho Meets Bloody Mary. Falling into semi-obscurity past its eccentric title, the film gained notoriety once again in 1997, when it was featured on the television series Mystery Science Theater 3000. Steckler's next film was his answer to Psycho, entitled The Thrill Killers, released in 1964. The film marked the first effort between Steckler and Ron Haydock, who would be Steckler's creative partner up until the latter's death in the 1970s. It also notably features Gary Kent as a blood-thirsty killer. Steckler continued to produce a number of low-budget but fanciful films which soon attained cult status, including Rat Pfink a Boo Boo (a spoof of Batman) and Lemon Grove Kids Meet the Monsters (an homage to the East Side Kids films). By the late 1960s, he also directed the music video for Jefferson Airplane's \\"White Rabbit\\", as well as \\"Open My Eyes\\" by The Nazz. Steckler's low-budget often meant working for little to nothing, but his comradeship was often reflected in his productions. In his 1969 film Body Fever, Steckler created a bit part for then destitute fellow director Coleman Francis, who, by coincidence, also achieved belated fame via Mystery Science Theater 3000. Francis died not long after the making of the film. Later life and career With the decline of drive-in horror films of the nature Steckler was producing in the 1960s, and following his divorce from Brandt, with whom he had daughters Linda and Laura, Steckler produced hardcore adult films during the 1970s and 1980s. Circa 1986, he married his second wife, Katherine, with whom he had daughters Morgan and Bailey. Steckler named daughter Morgan after his partner George Morgan who financed The Incredibly Strange Creatures. The Thrill Killers, Rat-Pfink a Boo-Boo, The Incredibly Strange Creatures and Las Vegas Serial Killer were first released on home video 1986‚Äì1987 by CAMP Home Video, a small independent company based in Los Angeles, CA. In the late 1980s, Steckler opened Mascot Video in Las Vegas and sold it in 1995 to local businessman Dan Wayman. Up until his death in 2009, Steckler continued to sell videos of his works via the web, including six volumes of young actresses and dancers in nude auditions for Steckler's camera. Steckler says these auditions were shot in 1991 for The Hollywood Strangler in Las Vegas (a.k.a. Las Vegas Serial Killer), but that film was finished by 1987. In 2008, Steckler announced production of his new film One More Time, which he described as an \\"extension\\" (as opposed to a \\"sequel\\") to The Incredibly Strange Creatures, and launched two MySpace pages and a website for casting actresses for his upcoming films. Steckler completed post- production of One More Time shortly before his death. It was filmed on location on the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and Las Vegas on a budget of $3,800 using two Digital 8 cameras. The film was released direct-to-DVD via his website in 2009.

It is the capital of the province of Treviso and the municipality has 84,669 inhabitants (as of September 2017):. Some 3,000 live within the Venetian walls (le Mura) or in the historical and monumental center; some 80,000 live in the urban center while the city hinterland has a population of approximately 170,000.. The city is home to the headquarters of clothing retailer Benetton, Sisley, Stefanel, Geox, Diadora and Lotto Sport Italia, appliance maker De'Longhi, and bicycle maker Pinarello. Treviso is also known for being the original production area of Prosecco wine and radicchio, and is thought to have been the origin of the popular Italian dessert Tiramis√π.  History  = Ancient era = Some believe that Treviso derived its name from the Celtic word \\"tarvos\\" mixed with the Latin ending \\"isium\\" forming \\"Tarvisium\\". Others believe it comes from a word from the language of a tribe who first came to Treviso. Tarvisium, then a city of the Veneti, became a municipium in 89 BC after the Romans added Cisalpine Gaul to their dominions. Citizens were ascribed to the Roman tribe of Claudia. The city lay in proximity of the Via Postumia, which connected Opitergium to Aquileia, two major cities of Roman Venetia during Ancient and early medieval times. Treviso is rarely mentioned by ancient writers, although Pliny writes of the Silis, that is the Sile River, as flowing ex montibus Tarvisanis. During the Roman period, Christianity spread to Treviso. Tradition records that St. Prosdocimus, a Greek who had been ordained bishop by St. Peter, brought the Catholic faith to Treviso and surrounding areas. By the 4th century, the Christian population grew sufficient to merit a resident bishop. The first documented bishop was John the Pious who began his episcopacy in 396 AD. = Early Middle Ages = Treviso went through a demographic and economic decline similar to the rest of Italy after the fall of the Western Empire; however, it was spared by Attila the Hun, and thus, remained an important center during the 6th century. According to tradition, Treviso was the birthplace of Totila, the leader of Ostrogoths during the Gothic Wars. Immediately after the Gothic Wars, Treviso fell under the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna until 568 AD when it was taken by the Lombards, who made it one of 36 ducal seats and established an important mint. The latter was especially important during the reign of the last Lombard king, Desiderius, and continued to churn out coins when northern Italy was annexed to the Frankish Empire. People from the city also played a role in the founding of Venice. Charlemagne made it the capital of a border march, i.e. the Marca Trevigiana, which lasted for several centuries. = Middle Ages = Treviso joined the Lombard League, and gained independence after the Peace of Constance (1183). This lasted until the rise of seignories in northern Italy. In 1214, Treviso was the scene of the Castle of Love that turned into a war between Padua and Venice. Among the various families who ruled over Treviso, the Da Romano reigned from 1237 to 1260. Struggles between Guelph and Ghibelline factions followed, with the first triumphant in 1283 with Gherardo III da Camino, after which Treviso experienced significant economic and cultural growth which continued until 1312. Treviso and its satellite cities, including Castelfranco Veneto (founded by the Trevigiani in contraposition to Padua), had become attractive to neighbouring powers, including the da Carrara and Scaligeri. After the fall of the last Caminesi lord, Rizzardo IV, the Marca was the site of continuous struggles and ravages (1329‚Äì1388). Treviso notary and physician Oliviero Forzetta was an avid collector of antiquities and drawings; the collection was published in a catalog in 1369, the earliest such catalog to survive to this day.Taylor, F. H. (1948). The Taste of Angels: a history of art collecting from Rameses to Napoleon . Boston: Little, Brown. p. 43. Retrieved 13 September 2014. = Venetian rule = After a Scaliger domination in 1329‚Äì1339, the city gave itself to the Republic of Venice, becoming the first notable mainland possession of the Serenissima. From 1318 it was also, for a short time, the seat of a university. Venetian rule brought innumerable benefits; however, Treviso necessarily became involved in the wars of Venice. From 1381‚Äì1384, the city was captured and ruled by the duke of Austria, and then by the Carraresi until 1388. Having returned to Venice, the city was fortified and given a massive line of walls and ramparts, still existing; these were renewed in the following century under the direction of Fra Giocondo, two of the gates being built by the Lombardi. The many waterways were exploited with several waterwheels which mainly powered mills for milling grain produced locally. The waterways were all navigable and \\"barconi\\" would arrive from Venice at the Port of Treviso (Porto de Fiera) pay duty and offload their merchandise and passengers along Riviera Santa Margherita. Fishermen were able to bring fresh catch every day to the Treviso fish market, which is held still today on an island connected to the rest of the city by two small bridges at either end. Gate San Tomaso, with the Lion of Saint Mark, emblem of the Venetian Republic = French and Austrian rule = Treviso was taken in 1797 by the French under Mortier, who was made duke of Treviso. French domination lasted until the defeat of Napoleon, after which it passed to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The citizens, still at heart loyal to the fallen Venetian Republic, were displeased with imperial rule and in March 1848, drove out the Austrian garrison. However, after the town was bombarded, the people were compelled to capitulate in the following 14 June. Austrian rule continued until Treviso was annexed with the rest of Veneto to the Kingdom of Italy in 1866.See wikipedia page Veneto = 19th century and later = During World War I, Treviso held a strategic position close to the Austrian front. Just north, the Battle of Vittorio Veneto helped turn the tide of the War. During World War II, one of several Italian concentration camps was established for Slovene and Croatian civilians from the Province of Ljubljana in Monigo, near Treviso. The Monigo camp was disbanded with the Italian capitulation in 1943. The city suffered several bombing raids during World War II. A large part of the medieval structures of the city center were destroyed‚Äîincluding part of the Palazzo dei Trecento, later rebuilt‚Äîcausing the death of about 1,600 people.La mostra Treviso il 7 aprile 1944 In January 2005, a bomb enclosed in a candy egg and attributed to the so-called Italian Unabomber detonated on a Treviso street.

Rovigo (, ; ) is a town and comune in the Veneto region of Northeast Italy, the capital of the eponymous province.It should not be confused with the town of Bougara in Algeria which previously, under French rule, was called Rovigo. Geography Rovigo stands on the low ground known as Polesine, by rail southwest of Venice and south-southwest of Padua, and on the Adigetto Canal. The comune of Rovigo extends between the rivers Adige and Canal Bianco, west of the Adriatic Sea, except the frazione of Fenil del Turco that extends south of the Canal Bianco. Polesine is the name of the low ground between the lower courses of the rivers Adige and Po and the sea; the derivation of the name is much discussed, generally applied only to the province of Rovigo, but is sometimes extended to the near towns of Adria and Ferrara.  History  The \\"Don√†\\" tower. Rovigo (both Rodigium and Rhodigium in Latin script) appears to be first mentioned in a document from Ravenna dating April 24, 838; the origin of the name is uncertain. In 920 it was selected as his temporary residence by the bishop of Adria, Paolo Cattaneo, after the destruction of his city by Hungarian marauders; the fortifications he ordered were already finished in 945. The viscounts of Rovigo built a line of brick walls in the 1130s in the name of the House of Este. The current Torre Don√† is a remnant of the castle built some time in between; it is 66 m high and it may have been the highest brick tower at that time if the date of construction is correct. In 1194 Rovigo became a formal possession of Azzo VI d'Este, duke of Ferrara, who took the title of conte (count) of Rovigo. The Este authority ended in 1482, when the Venetians took the place by siege and retained possession of it by the peace of 1484. Although the Este recovered the city during the War of the League of Cambrai, the Venetians, returning in 1514, retained possession until the French Revolution. In 1806 Napoleon I Bonaparte created it a duch√© grand-fief for general Anne Jean Marie Ren√© Savary. The Austrians in 1815 made it a royal city. Stamp of Lombardy and Venetia, 5 soldi issue 1864, cancelled at ROVIGO With the fall of the 1815-1866 Kingdom of Lombardy‚ÄìVenetia, Rovigo was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy in 1866; in the same year it was connected by railway to Padua, Ferrara, Verona (through Legnago), and Chioggia (through Adria). In the 1900s the first modern industries were established, the most important of which was a sugar refinery. In 1927 the territory of the comune was extended including close municipalities. In 1937 the course of the Adigetto Canal was diverted to the west edge of the town and a large avenue called Corso del Popolo was built in place of the former course. In the years 1943‚Äì1945 Rovigo was part of the Italian Social Republic and it has been in Italy since 1946. In the 1950s and 1960s Rovigo had a dramatic development and it had the highest urbanization rate among the towns in the Veneto region after World War II.

His final rank was 23rd overall. Petersson was also a member of the 9th-place Swedish men's archery team. He won the World Indoor Championships in 1995 and 1999, and became the first male archer to win this tournament twice. 2008 Summer Olympics At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing Petersson finished his ranking round with a total of 646 points. This gave him the 49th seed for the final competition bracket in which he faced Crispin Duenas in the first round. Both archers scored 108 points and the match had to be decided by an extra round in which Petersson scored 19 points and Duenas 18. In the next round Maksim Kunda was too strong and advanced to the third round with 112-110.

The term is popular in the United States, but the setting is similar to a retirement home, in the sense that facilities provide a group living environment and typically cater to an older adult population. There is also Caribbean assisted living, which offers a similar service in a resort-like environment (somewhat like assisted vacationing). Assisted living exemplifies the shift from \\"care as service\\" to \\"care as business\\" in the broader health care arena predicted more than three decades ago.Starr, P. 1982. The Social Transformation of American Medicine. New York: Basic Books. A consumer-driven industry, assisted living offers a wide range of options, levels of care, and diversity of services (Lockhart, 2009) and is subject to state rather than federal regulatory oversight. What \\"Assisted living\\" means depends on both the state and provider in question: variations in state regulatory definitions are significant and provider variables include everything from philosophy, geographic location and auspice, to organizational size and structure. Assisted living evolved from small \\"board and care\\" or \\"personal care\\" homes and offers a \\"social model\\" of care (compared to the medical model of a skilled nursing facility). The assisted living industry is a segment of the senior housing industry and assisted living services can be delivered in stand-alone facilities or as part of multi-level senior living community. The industry is fragmented and dominated by for-profit providers. In 2010, six of the seventy largest providers were non-profit and none of the top twenty was non-profit (Martin, 2010). Information in this edit is from an article published in 2012 that reviewed the industry and reports results of a research study of assisted living facilities.Cirka, C.C., & Messikomer, C.M. 2012. Behind the facade: Aligning artifacts, values and assumptions in assisted living. Business & Professional Ethics Journal, 31 (1), 79 - 107. In 2012 the U.S. Government estimated that there were 22,200 assisted living facilities in the U.S. (compared to 15,700 nursing homes) and that 713,300 people were residents of these facilities.CDC, Long Term Care Services, 2013, https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nsltcp/long_term_care_services_2013.pdf The number of assisted living facilities in the U.S. has increased dramatically since the early 2000s. In the U.S., ALFs can be owned by for-profit companies (publicly traded companies or limited liability companies [LLCs]), non-profit organizations, or governments. These facilities typically provide supervision or assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs); coordination of services by outside health care providers; and monitoring of resident activities to help to ensure their health, safety, and well-being. Assistance often includes the administration or supervision of medication, or personal care services. There has been controversy generated by reports of neglect, abuse and mistreatment of residents at assisted living facilities in the U.S. Canada In Canada, there are also some differences in how assisted living is understood from one province to the next. In most provinces, the phrase is understood as less independent than it is in the United States. People often require help with more than one of the activities of daily living or the more intensive ADLs like feeding or bathing. In the province of Alberta, \\"supportive living\\" is the distinct phrasing used for a type of care that is otherwise synonymous. The province's Supportive Living Accommodation Licensing Act is a comprehensive act with specific prescriptions governing care homes licensing, inspections and more. United States Within the United States assisted living spectrum, there is no nationally recognized definition of assisted living. Assisted living facilities are regulated and licensed at the US state level. These regulations include staffing, training, and quality and safety standards. This is differentiated from nursing homes, which are regulated on a federal level and are generally held to more stringent standards. More than two-thirds of the states use the licensure term \\"assisted living.\\" Other licensure terms used for this philosophy of care include residential care home, assisted care living facilities, and personal care homes. Each state licensing agency has its own definition of the term it uses to describe assisted living. Because the term assisted living has not been defined in some states it is often a marketing term used by a variety of senior living communities, licensed or unlicensed. Assisted living facilities in the United States had a national median monthly rate of $3,500.00 in 2014, a 1.45% increase over 2013 and a 4.29% increase over a five-year period from 2009-2014. =Types= As widely varied as the state licensing and definitions are, so are the types of physical layouts of buildings in which assisted living services are provided. The average assisted living facility is in a commercial building, yet some assisted living services use large residential buildings, known as Residential Assisted Living homes, or \\"RAL\\". Residential Assisted Living homes can vary in price and amenities, and can even be grouped into a separate term known as a Luxury Residential Assisted Living Home, or \\"LRAL\\". Assisted living facilities can range in size from a small residential house for one resident up to very large facilities providing services to hundreds of residents. Assisted living falls somewhere between an independent living community and a skilled nursing facility in terms of the level of care provided. Continuing care retirement facilities combine independent living, assisted living, and nursing care in one facility. People who live in newer assisted living facilities usually have their own private apartment. There is usually no special medical monitoring equipment that one would find in a nursing home, and their nursing staff may not be available at all hours. However, trained staff are usually on-site around the clock to provide other needed services. Household chores are performed: sheets are changed, laundry is done, and food is cooked and served as part of the base rent and included services. Depending on their disclosure of services, assisted living services may include medication management, bathing assistance, dressing, escorts to meals and activities, toileting, transferring, and insulin injections by an RN. Some assisted living providers also offer amenities like exercise rooms or a beauty parlor on site. Grocery service is often available too. Where provided, private apartments generally are self-contained; i.e., they have their own bedroom and bathroom, and may have a separate living area or small kitchen. Registered nurses and licensed practical nurses are available by phone or e-mail 24 hours a day, to ensure proper teaching and/or education of staff is available. Alternatively, individual living spaces may resemble a dormitory or hotel room consisting of a private or semi-private sleeping area and a shared bathroom. There are usually common areas for socializing, as well as a central kitchen and dining room for preparing and eating meals. =Typical resident= An assisted living resident is defined as a resident who needs assistance with at least one of the activities of daily living. A typical assisted living facility resident would usually be an older adult who does not need the level of care offered by a nursing home but prefers more companionship and needs some assistance in day-to-day living. Age groups will vary with every facility. There is currently a transformation occurring in long-term care. Assisted living communities are accepting higher and higher levels of care and nursing homes are becoming a place for those who are undergoing rehabilitation after a hospital stay or who need extensive assistance. Many assisted living communities now accept individuals who need assistance with all activities of daily living. The \\"Overview of Assisted Living Report\\" from 2010 stated that 54 percent of assisted living residents are 85 years or older; 27 percent are 75‚Äì84 years old; 9 percent of residents are between 65 and 74 years; and 11 percent are younger than 65 years old. 74% of assisted living residents are female; 26 percent are male. =Special needs= The residence may assist in arranging the appropriate medical, health, and dental care services for each resident. The resident generally chooses his or her medical doctor and dental services. Residents who have periods of temporary incapacity due to illness, injury, or recuperation from surgery often choose assisted living as a supportive option to help them recover quickly so then can return home. In the case of these short-term respite stays, assisted living residences act as the bridge between hospital and home. Short-term respite stays in assisted living are also an option for families when the primary caregiver goes out of town or is otherwise unable to provide the needed care. More recently built facilities are designed with an emphasis on ease of use for disabled people. Bathrooms and kitchens are designed with wheelchairs and walkers in mind. Hallways and doors are extra- wide to accommodate wheelchairs. These facilities are by necessity fully compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) or similar legislation elsewhere. The socialization aspects of ALFs are very beneficial to the occupants. Normally the facility has many activities scheduled for the occupants, keeping in mind different disabilities and needs. =Locked units= Many ALFs also serve the needs of people with some form of dementia including Alzheimer's disease and others with mental disabilities, as long as they do not present an imminent danger to themselves or others. The sections of the building where these residents live are often referred to as memory care. In the United States, legislation enacted by each state defines not only the level of care, but often what conditions are prohibited from being cared for in such a home. * In California, these units are not \\"locked\\" they are secured by alarms, delays, keypads needing a code, etc. However, they are not locked units like a psychiatric ward. Many ALFs will work to accommodate a person who suffers from severe forms of Alzheimer's by having separate private units. These specialized care areas are part of the main building but are secured so residents with Alzheimer's cannot leave and possibly do harm to themselves. These care areas usually house fewer people and more attention from the caregivers is provided. The units, usually called locked units, focus on applying cognitive and mental activities to try to help keep the mind fresh. Since there is no cure for the disease, the goal is to work at prolonging or delaying the disease. If one is not engaged in activity, his or her memory will deteriorate more rapidly. =Controversy= 2011 Miami Herald investigation A 2011 investigation by the Miami Herald into assisted living facilities in Florida won the Pulitzer Prize, and found that: # \\"the safeguards once hailed as the most progressive in the nation have been ignored in a string of tragedies never before revealed to the public,\\" # \\"that the Agency for Health Care Administration, which oversees the state‚Äôs 2,850 assisted-living facilities, has failed to monitor shoddy operators, investigate dangerous practices or shut down the worst offenders,\\" and # \\"as the ranks of assisted-living facilities grew to make room for Florida‚Äôs booming elderly population, the state failed to protect the people it was meant to serve.\\" The investigation found dozens of incidents of gross mismanagement and criminal behavior at assisted living facilities across Florida, a state of 20 million people which is popular with American retirees. The newspaper requested the release of state documents related to the deaths of over 300 people in assisted living facilities between 2003 and 2011 but were denied these documents. Still, the newspaper's investigation found no less than 70 people who had died due to the \\"actions of their caregivers.\\"Miami Herald, April 30, 2011 5:00 AM, NEGLECTED TO DEATH  Part 2: Assisted-living facility caretakers unpunished: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a lack of justice‚Äô, http://www.miamiherald.com/news/special-reports/neglected-to- death/article1938087.html The deaths were found to have resulted from the mismanagement of assisted living facilities and by the practices of their staff and managers who drugged residents, deprived them of basic necessities such as food and water, abused residents verbally, psychologically and physically, and neglecting their needs. 2013 Frontline investigation On July 30, 2013 Frontline ran an hour long program with help from ProPublica detailing some tragedies that happened in assisted living. At the time the documentary was broadcast and published, Frontline stated that, \\"Today, nearly 750,000 people live in assisted living facilities across the country. National for-profit chains, concerned both about caring for their residents and pleasing their shareholders, have come to dominate the industry. Standards for care and training‚Äîand even definitions for the term 'assisted living'‚Äîvary from state to state. Assisted living facilities, unlike nursing homes, are not regulated by the federal government.\\" An accompanying written brief cites deaths of residents, facilities that are understaffed, employees that are inadequately trained, and that an overall \\"push to fill facilities and maximize revenues has left staff overwhelmed and the care of residents endangered.\\" A related article by ProPublica (Thomson and Jones, July 29, 2013) states that a facility operated by Emeritus Senior Living \\"...had been found wanting in almost every important regard. And, in truth, those 'specially trained' staffers hadn‚Äôt actually been trained to care for people with Alzheimer‚Äôs and other forms of dementia, a violation of California law.\\" It goes on to say, \\"The facility relied on a single nurse to track the health of its scores of residents, and the few licensed medical professionals who worked there tended not to last long,\\" but also that \\"During some stretches, the facility went months without a full-time nurse on the payroll.\\" ProPublica's article claimed the problem was not specific to one facility and that \\"State inspectors for years had cited Emeritus facilities across California.\\" Emeritus replied to that claim, describing \\"any shortcomings as isolated,\\" as well as that \\"any problems that arise are promptly addressed.\\" The company cited their \\"growing popularity as evidence of consumer satisfaction.\\" =Comparison between assisted living and personal care= In Pennsylvania, personal care and assisted living are terms that are defined separately. Personal care and assisted living in PA are regulated by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Human Services Licensing (a division of the Department of Human Services). Up until January 2011, the terms ‚Äúassisted living‚Äù and ‚Äúpersonal care‚Äù were considered interchangeable. At that time, Pennsylvania began licensing assisted living facilities separately from personal care facilities. Chapter 2800 of the 55 Pennsylvania Code defines assisted living as ‚Äúa significant long-term care alternative to allow individuals to age in place,‚Äù where residents ‚Äúwill receive the assistance they need to age in place and develop and maintain maximum independence, exercise decision-making and personal choice.‚Äù Likewise, Chapter 2600 of the 55 Pa. Code defines personal care as ‚ÄúA premise in which food, shelter and personal assistance or supervision are provided for a period exceeding 24 hours, for four or more adults who are not relatives of the operator, who do not require the services in or of a licensed long-term care facility, but who do require assistance or supervision in activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living.‚Äù The differences between the two levels of care is broken down into three categories: Concept ‚Äì Assisted living residences permit residents to age in place, meaning that even as their health care needs increase, they will not have to relocate to another senior living home to receive that care, such as skilled nursing. Construction ‚Äì Assisted living residences must provide residents a private room with a lockable door, a private bathroom and small kitchen. Personal care homes are not required to offer these amenities. Level of Care ‚Äì Assisted living residences must ensure that residents receive skilled nursing care if their needs surpass standard assisted living services. United Kingdom Assisted living is known as extra-care housing or retirement living which allows residents over the age of 55 or 60 to live independently. They are offered a self-contained flat or bungalow and have staff that are available to them 24 hours a day to provide personal care. Staff help with washing, dressing residents, taking medication and they do domestic duties such as shopping and laundry for them, they also prepare and serve meals to residents if provided. Residents are often asked whether to own or rent their properties independently, the average cost ranges from ¬£500 to ¬£1,500 depending on where the resident lives. Assisted living accommodations would often include a scheme manager or a team of support staff, nurses and care staff onsite, 24-hour emergency alarm systems, communal lounges to socialise with other residents. Assisted living housing is regulated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).

It is the second bridge at the same site to carry that name. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in November 2012. Design The bridge was designed by Ira G. HedrickIra Grant Hedrick, Designer of Bridges; Built the Burnside Lift Span at Portland, Ore.-Firm Did Work in Mexico-Dies at 69. The New York Times. and Robert E. Kremers, incorporating a bascule lift mechanism designed by Joseph Strauss. The bridge almost fully opened Including approaches, the Burnside has a total length of and a center span. While lowered this span is normally above the river. The deck is made of concrete, which contributes to its being one of the heaviest bascule bridges in the United States. The counterweights, housed inside the two piers, weigh . The lifting is normally controlled by the Hawthorne Bridge operator, but an operator staffs the west tower during high river levels. As of 2005, the bridge opened for river traffic an average of 35 times a month. The bridge provides shelter for the initially unauthorized Burnside Skatepark under the east end. On weekends, the Portland Saturday Market was held mostly under the bridge's west end for many years. The market was reoriented in 2009, but the Burnside Bridge continues to provide shelter for a few vendor stalls at the market's northern end. History In 1891, Burnside Street was renamed from \\"B\\" street to take the name of Dan Wyman Burnside, a local businessman who was a proponent of the 1866 dredging of the Willamette River. Construction of the original Burnside Bridge began in November 1892, and the bridge opened on July 4, 1894. It was a swing-span truss bridge made of wrought iron and steel. The replacement was part of a $4.5 million bond that also included the construction of the Ross Island and Sellwood bridges. The public would later learn that the contract was given for $500,000 more than the lowest bid. Three Multnomah County commissioners were recalled as a result of the scandal, and a new engineering company assumed control of the project. One of the bridge's two ornate towers The bridge opened on May 28, 1926, at a final cost of $4.5 million (including approaches). It was the first Willamette River bridge in Portland designed with input from an architect. This led to the Italian Renaissance towers and decorative metal railings. The bascule system was designed by Joseph Strauss. The initial principal engineer for the bridge construction was the firm of Hedrick & Kremers. The bridge was then completed by Gustav Lindenthal, who also supervised its construction. Streetcars crossed the Burnside Bridge until 1950,Hatch, Tom (February 27, 1980). \\"End of lines 30 years ago: New 'trolleys' can't beat old ones\\". The Oregonian, p.

Los Angeles: Interurbans. LCCN 74-20367. Currently, three TriMet bus routes use the bridge. In the 1990s the Burnside Bridge was made a Regional Emergency Transportation Route, the one non-freeway bridge to be used by emergency vehicles. In 1995 one of the six lanes was removed to accommodate new bicycle lanes. From March until November 2002 the bridge went through a $2.1 million seismic retrofit, making it the first bridge operated by Multnomah County to receive earthquake protection. The bridge was under construction in 2006 in order to replace the deck. The electric streetcar tracks, abandoned in 1950, were visible during the construction. This project was budgeted at $9 million and the majority of the work was completed on December 9, 2007. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in November 2012. Burnside Skatepark The Eastbank Esplanade, which opened in 2001, is connected to the bridge by stairs added during the esplanade's construction. However, because of the bridge's age, it cannot support any extra weight, so the stairways must be supported by separate pilings. In 2020, the Earthquake Ready Burnside Bridge project deemed thet the current short span bridge would not survive a major earthquake, and recommended a replacement long span bridge.https://multco.us/earthquake-ready- burnside-bridge In popular culture Indie rock band the Mountain Goats prominently mention the Burnside Bridge in the lyrics of their 2012 song \\"Steal Smoked Fish\\".

Visitors can access the Monument by traveling northbound from Silver City, New Mexico approximately 37 miles on NM 15.  Cliff dwellings in New Mexico  Map of major prehistoric Oasisamerica archaeological cultures Considered by archaeologists to be on the northernmost portion of the Mogollon People's sphere of influence, the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument is home to two prominent ruins sites among a collection of smaller sites located within the Gila Wilderness inside the Gila National Forest. The Monument landscape ranges in elevation from around 5,700 to 7,300 feet above sea level and follows the branches of the Gila River. The terrain around the ruins is rugged and arid, and contains steep-sided canyons cut by shallow spring rivers and mesas and bluffs forested with Ponderosa pine, Gambel's oak, Douglas fir, New Mexico juniper, pinon pine, and alligator juniper (among others). The area geologic history stems from the Oligocene epoch and volcanic activity that subsequently covered the area with ash. The Monument's hot springs are remnants of this volcanic history. The Monument consists of and contains the remains of a Mimbres Culture community in various locations, two of which are most prominent. The namesake ruins' developers made use of natural caves to build interlinked dwellings within five cliff alcoves above Cliff Dweller Canyon.http://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/gicl/adhi/images/fig3.jpg The TJ Ruinshttp://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002451607 are located on a bluff overlooking the Gila River.http://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/gicl/adhi/images/fig14.jpg The Mogollon Peoples are believed to have inhabited the region from between 1275 and into the early 14th century, during the Pueblo III Era.

Dendrochronology (tree ring dating) determined that the wood used in the dwellings were cut between 1276 and 1287. The region provided for growing, gathering and hunting food. To visit the namesake dwellings, requires visitors to hike a well- traveled mile (1.6 km) long trail loop with several foot bridges over a stream. The entire walk takes about an hour. The hike begins at an elevation of 5695 Feet (1736 Meters) and ends at 5875 Feet (1790 Meters). Modern history  Though local Native American Indians were aware of the location of ruins, the first European contact with the Gila Cliff Dwellings was by Henry B. Ailman (an emigrant to New Mexico who was residing in Silver City at the time). In the summer of 1878, Ailman and several friends were summoned to serve for jury duty and in an effort to avoid the summons, they organized a prospecting trip to the Gila River where they subsequently came upon the site. Throughout the following years, many visitors would study the dwellings. Soon the site became more accessible and in the 1890s the Hill brothers had established a resort at the nearby Gila Hot Springs. The Hill brothers would begin the first tours to the ruin for their guests. In June 1906, Rep. John F. Lacey of Iowa and chairman of the House Public Lands Committee introduced a bill for the regulation of prehistoric sites. The Act for the Preservation of Antiquities, commonly known as the Antiquities Act, authorized the US President to set aside land that contained prehistoric and historic ruins by executive order. Gila Cliff DwellingLooking out from one of the cave dwellingsThese federal reservations were called national monuments and were to be managed by the Interior, Agriculture, and War departments, depending on which agency had controlled a particular site before it was withdrawn for preservation.National Park Service - Antiquities Act In December 1906, Gila Forest Supervisor R. C. McClure reported to the chief forester in Washington, D.C. that the Gila Cliff Dwellings warranted preservation by the national government to avoid further removal of artifacts by hunters and other prospectors. Several mummified bodies had been found at the Gila Cliff Dwellings location, though most were lost to looters and private collectors. In 1912, a burial ground was found; a mummified infant later referred to as \\"Zeke\\" was located. The discovery gained national attention and increased the monument's popularity and visitor numbers. In turn, additional improvements were made in the following years. The mummy is the only known mummy to be acquired by Smithsonian from the monument. The first park ranger was an early settler to the region Doc Cambell. He helped Park service crews stabilize the ruins . The Campbell‚Äôs still guide wilderness trips from their Campels Post in nearby Gila Hot Springs. Administration of the monument was transferred from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to the National Park Service on August 10, 1933, by Executive Order 6166. President Kennedy would later sign proclamation no. 3467, that added approximately and contained the TJ site, as well as additional wilderness area. In the spring of 1975, the National Park Service and the United States Forest Service signed a cooperative agreement where the Gila National Forest is responsible for administration of the monument. Monument exhibits and services T-shaped doorway, common in precontact Southwestern stacked stone buildings A museum and visitors center is located at the monument near the TJ Ruins. The visitor center is jointly operated by the U.S. Forest Service, and the National Park Service. The Museum hosts exhibits of Apache and Mogollon artifacts, uncovered both in the surrounding wilderness, and at the Monument. Displayed items include a bracelet crafted from Glycymeris (shells) Bittersweet clam shell found by a student park ranger Charles Grymko . Believed to have been brought via trade from the Gulf of California, to Snaketown (an ancient village on the right bank of the Gila River on the modern-day Gila River Indian Community south of the village of Ahwatukee), the shell eventually was etched and drilled by Hohokam artisans. The bracelet is believed then to have made its way up the Gila River from Arizona to the Gila river community, again, by way of trade. Other nearby attractions include hot springs, associated ruins sites, national forest hiking trails and fishing along the Gila River and in the Gila Wilderness.

His father was born to an Algerian Jewish family while his mother was a convert to Judaism.Joseph Tol√©dano, Les Juifs maghr√©bins, Brepols, 1989, p. 287 Lelouch says that his first contact with cinema was very young: \\"My mother hid me in movie theaters when I was little. We were wanted by the Gestapo. [...] Cinema, for starters, saved my life.\\" Of his personal faith, he says \\"Today I believe in God. My faith was sparked when I made a film in Israel. Over there, it is impossible not to believe in God. I loved the places of worship of all the religions. Everything which happens is for the best.

He started his career with a reportage ‚Äì one of the first to film daily life in the Soviet Union, with the camera hidden under his coat as he made his personal journey. He also filmed sporting events, like the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Tour de France. His first full-length film as director, Le Propre de l'homme, was decried by the critics: \\"Claude Lelouch, remember this name well, because you will not hear it again\\" ‚Äì Cahiers du cin√©ma said. La femme spectacle (1963), following prostitutes, women shopping, going for nose-jobs, was censored for its misogynist tendency. A Man and a Woman changed his fortunes and was met with favour even by the Cahiers group. The 1981 musical epic Les Uns et les Autres is widely considered as his masterpiece, and his credits now add up to 50 or so films. His 1976 film, C'√©tait un rendez-vous purportedly features a Ferrari 275 GTB being driven at extreme speed through the streets of Paris at dawn. The entire short is shot from the point of view of the car. Legend has it that Lelouch was arrested after it was first shown publicly. In a 2006 interview, Lelouch stated that he drove his own Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 in the film and created a soundtrack of the radically different sounding Italian sports car for effect.IMDB Trivia , imdb.com; accessed 21 February 2016. He collaborated more than two dozen times with composer Francis Lai.

Magog (; Hebrew: ◊û◊í◊ï◊í ; Greek: ŒúŒ±Œ≥œâŒ≥) is the second of the seven sons of Japheth mentioned in the Table of Nations in Genesis . While the origin of the term is unclear, it may have referred to Lydia, in what is now Turkey. Its use in the Book of Ezekiel, Chapter 38 has led to it being associated with apocalyptic traditions. Various ancient and medieval traditions have built on the biblical references and added details to it. Etymology The origin of the name Magog is unclear. It may come from the Akkadian mat Gugi, \\"land of Gog\\", that is, the land of Gyges: Lydia.Daniel Block (2013), Beyond the River Chebar: Studies in Kingship and Eschatology in the Book of Ezekiel, p. 107. In the Bible Magog is often associated with apocalyptic traditions, mainly in connection with Ezekiel 38 and 39 which mentions \\"Gog of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal\\" (Ezek 38:2 NIV); on the basis of this mention, \\"Gog and Magog\\" over time became associated with each other as a pair. In the New Testament, this pairing is found in the Book of Revelation 20:8, in which instance they may merely be metaphors for archetypal enemies of God. Ancient and medieval views Josephus refers to Magog son of Japheth as progenitor of Scythians, or peoples north of the Black Sea. According to him, the Greeks called Scythia Magogia. An alternate identification derived from an examination of the order in which tribal names are listed in Ezekiel 38, \\"would place Magog between Cappadocia and Media.\\"Encyclopedia Biblica, 1899. Entry on 'Gog and Magog'. According to Rabbi Shlomo Ganzfried (19th century) Magog refers to the Mongols. He cites an Arab writer who refers to the Great Wall of China with the name 'Magog'.Scherman, Nosson. The Artscroll Tanach Series: Bereishis/Genesis. Mesorah Publications, 1995, p. 311. Jordanes' Getica (551) mentions Magog as ancestor of the Goths, as does the Historia Brittonum, but Isidore of Seville (c. 635) asserts that this identification was popular \\"because of the similarity of the last syllable\\" (Etymologiae, IX, 89). Johannes Magnus (1488‚Äì1544) stated that Magog migrated to Scandinavia (via Finland) 88 years after the flood, and that his five sons were Suenno (ancestor of the Swedes), Gethar (or Gog, ancestor of the Goths), Ubbo (who later ruled the Swedes and built Old Uppsala), Thor, and German.Johannes Magnus, Historia de omnibus Gothorum Sveonumque regibus, 1554, I, Chapters 4‚Äì5, GMC., Cambridge Mass, oclc 27775895 Magnus's accounts became accepted at the Swedish court for a long time, and even caused the dynastic numerals of the Swedish monarchs to be renumbered accordingly. Queen Christina of Sweden reckoned herself as number 249 in a list of kings going back to Magog. Magnus also influenced several later historians such as Daniel Juslenius (1676‚Äì1752), who derived the roots of the Finns from Magog. According to several medieval Irish chronicles, most notably the Auraicept na n-√âces and Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn, the Irish race are a composite including descendants of Japheth's son Magog from \\"Scythia\\". Baath mac Magog (Boath), Jobhath, and Fathochta are the three sons of Magog. Fenius Farsaid, Parthol√≥n, Nemed, the Fir Bolg, the Tuatha de Danann, and the Milesians are among Magog's descendants. Magog was also supposed to have had a grandson called Heber, whose offspring spread throughout the Mediterranean. There is also a medieval Hungarian legend that says the Huns, as well as the Magyars, are descended from twin brothers named Hunor and Magor respectively, who lived by the sea of Azov in the years after the flood, and took wives from the Alans. The version of this legend in the 14th century Chronicon Pictum equates this Magor with Magog, son of Japheth. In Islam The Monster of Gog and Magog, Muhammad ibn Muhammad Shakir Ruzmah-'i Nathani Magog's appearance in the Quran and other Islamic sources is chiefly due to his apocalyptic renown as part of the pairing of Gog and Magog (Arabic: Ya'juj wa Ma'juj). In sura Al-Kahf (\\"The Cave\\", 18:83-98) of the Quran (early 7th century AD), an individual called Dhul-Qarnayn (\\"The Two- horned One\\") journeys to a distant land in a pass between two mountains where he finds people who are suffering from the mischief of Gog and Magog. Dhul- Qarnayn then makes a wall of copper and iron to keep Gog and Magog out, but warns that it will be removed in the Last Age. In sura 21, Al-AnbiyƒÅ (The Prophets), the wall is mentioned again: there Allah tells His Prophet (Muhammad) that there is a \\"prohibition upon [the people of] a city which We have destroyed that they will [ever] return, until [the dam of] Gog and Magog has been opened and thou shall see them, from every higher ground, descending.\\"  In popular culture  *In the season 13 episode Good Intentions of the TV series Supernatural, Magog appears as a warrior, alongside another named Gog. They battle protagonists Castiel and Dean Winchester. After Dean kills them, Magog and Gog are revealed to be primitive beasts formed of rock and sand, a type of creature Castiel had believed to have gone extinct during the Great Flood. *In the 23-minute epic Genesis song Supper's Ready from 1972 the \\"Guards of Magog\\" are mentioned in the 6th section entitled \\"Apocalypse in 9/8 (Co-Starring the Delicious Talents of Gabble Ratchet)\\". During live performances of the song lead singer Peter Gabriel would wear an outfit to represent Magog. *In the TV series Andromeda, the Magog are depicted as a hostile race of aliens who attack earth and decimate its population. They are shown to reproduce by laying eggs in human hosts only to devour the host upon birth. *In the tabletop RPG Shadow of the Demon Lord, Magog is the name of a powerful Genie who eventually creates the Men of Gog, a race dedicated to destroying the immortal races of the world of Urth.

Early life and career Frank grew up in Mount Kisco, New York. He started his career as a sales executive for Paramount Pictures, subsequently moving on to Guild Films, and NBC television. Later, he was Senior Vice President of Worldwide Sales with the television division of the Wrather Corporation, which produced and distributed the Lassie and Lone Ranger TV programs. In 1964, he opened Sandy Frank Program Sales Inc. as his first company. His first distribution successes were You Asked For It and Lassie, for which he had acquired the rights from the Wrather Corp. Sandy Frank Entertainment Among the programs Frank's company produced or distributed were Name That Tune (1984‚Äì1985), Face the Music (1980‚Äì1981), The New Treasure Hunt (1973‚Äì1977), The Bobby Vinton Show (1975‚Äì1978), The Bill Cosby Show (1969‚Äì1971), The Dating Game (1973‚Äì1974), and Lee Mendelson's Superstar Specials. Frank later produced and distributed Name That Tune and Battle of the Planets. Frank was also the leading distributor of travel adventure shows including America, High and Wild, Across the Seven Seas, The Traveler, and American West. The company obtained rights and provided English dubbing for the entire line of Daiei Film monster movies . Due to the constraints of airing in the then-new UHF television \\"movie of the week\\" format, however, the English versions are substantially shortened from the Japanese originals. Many of these films have now lapsed to the public domain. In 1972 the cover of Broadcasting read: \\"Sandy Frank Film Syndication, Inc. sets a new syndication sales record with The Parent Game: 125 markets sold in just 100 days of selling.\\" =Battle of the Planets= In April 1977, Frank attended the MIP-TV conference in Cannes. It was here Frank first encountered the Japanese animation Science Ninja Team Gatchaman from producer Tatsunoko Production run by the Yoshida brothers. Frank committed to release the series in the United States after he saw the success of Star Wars in May 1977. Battle of the Planets is the title of the American adaptation of this series, created by Frank. He authorized new footage and hired writers to add dialog to fit the look of the animation without reference to original scripts. Of the 105 original Science Ninja Team Gatchaman episodes, 85 were used in the Battle of the Planets adaptation produced by Sandy Frank Entertainment in 1978. Frank's company is also known for its films‚Äô frequent appearances on Mystery Science Theater 3000, where some of the company's dubs of Japanese films were lampooned, including in a song titled \\"The Sandy Frank Song\\". =Later career= In 2000, NATPE, the professional organization of television program executives, featured Frank in the video The Legends of Syndication, an overview of the history of syndicated media selling. Frank formed alliances in 2011 with a number of companies such as The Asylum in the United States and Sony in other countries. SFE has marketed Dangerous Minds (hosted by Rudy Giuliani) for Primetime Network, You Asked for It for Prime Time Network, and Face the Music which is being re- launched in a new prime time version.  Film tax credit suit  In 2011 Frank filed suit against the denial of a tax credit to his production under Michigan's system of offering of up to 42% tax credits for the production of films in Michigan. The films supported are subject to restrictions such as that Michigan residents must be portrayed in a positive way, and game shows are not supported. Frank described his show as a reality show about the making of a game show and said that he made commitments of $350,000 after being told by state officials that his show would qualify for the credit, which was denied in 2009. The lawsuit claimed the restrictions were enforced arbitrarily, as other shows about competitions, including Crash Course and The Wedding Day, had received state support, as had potentially negative depictions in Hung, A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas, and Up In The Air. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Sandy Frank Productions claimed \\"violations of Michigan's film tax credit law, Michigan's administrative procedures act, unjust enrichment, breach of contract, fraud, misrepresentation, and violation of equal protection and due process under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\\" A federal district court judge dismissed the complaint on January 4, 2012.

The sitatunga is confined to swampy and marshy habitats. Here they occur in tall and dense vegetation as well as seasonal swamps, marshy clearings in forests, riparian thickets and mangrove swamps. Sitatungas in Chester Zoo, England. Taxonomy and genetics The scientific name of the sitatunga is Tragelaphus spekii. The species was first described by the English explorer John Hanning Speke in 1863. Speke first observed the sitatunga at a lake named \\"Little Windermere\\" (now Lake Lwelo, located in Kagera, Tanzania). In his book Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile, Speke called the animal \\"nzo√©\\" (Kiswahili name for the animal) or \\"water-boc\\" (due to its resemblance to the waterbuck). The scientific name has often been misstated as T. spekei, and either Speke or Sclater is referred to as the binomial authority. Speke had stated in a footnote in his book that the species had been named Tragelaphus spekii by English zoologist Philip Sclater. However, according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (Article 50.1.1) and the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, that acknowledge the person who first described the species, simply declaring Sclater as the authority in a footnote is insufficient to recognise him as the author. Hence, Speke was recognised as the correct authority and T. spekii (where spekii is the genitive of the Latinised \\"Spekius\\") was considered the correct name for the species. The sitatunga is placed under the genus Tragelaphus and in the family Bovidae. In 2005, Sandi Willows-Munro of the University of KwaZulu-Natal (Durban) carried out a mitochondrial analysis of the nine Tragelaphus species. mtDNA and nDNA data were compared. The results showed that sitatunga plus bongo (T. eurycerus) form a monophyletic clade with the mountain nyala (T. buxtoni) and k√©wel (T. scriptus). The greater kudu (T. strepsiceros) split from this clade approximately 8.6 million years ago. Within Tragelaphus, the k√©wel, bongo, sitatunga and nyala (T. angasii) are particularly close relatives. The bushbuck, that includes both imbabala (T. sylvaticus) and k√©wel, and sitatunga are genetically similar enough to hybridise. Hybrids between bongo and sitatunga have proved to be fertile. The sitatunga is more variable in its general characters than any other member of the tribe Strepsicerotini, that consists of the genera Taurotragus (elands) and Tragelaphus, probably because of their confinement to swampy and marshy habitats. On the basis of physical characteristics such as hair texture, coat colour and the coat stripes, up to ten subspecies of the sitatunga have been described. However, these factors may not be reliable since hair texture could vary with the climate, while pelage colour and markings vary greatly among individuals. Moreover, the coat might darken and the stripes and spots on it might fade with age, especially in males. The species might even be monotypic, however, based on different drainage systems, three distinct subspecies are currently recognised: * T. s. spekii (Speke, 1863): Nile sitatunga or East African sitatunga. Found in the Nile watershed. * T. s. gratus (Sclater, 1880): Congo sitatunga or forest sitatunga. Found in western and central Africa. * T. s. selousi (W. Rothschild, 1898): Southern sitatunga or Zambezi sitatunga. Found in southern Africa. Description The sitatunga is a medium-sized antelope. It is sexually dimorphic, with males considerably larger than females. The head-and- body length is typically between in males and in females. Males reach approximately at the shoulder, while females reach . Males typically weigh , while females weigh . The tail is long. The saucer-shaped ears are long. Only the males possess horns; these are spiral in shape, have one or two twists and are long. The sitatunga is almost indistinguishable from the nyala, except in pelage and spoor. Speke pointed out that, though \\"closely allied\\" to the waterbuck, the sitatunga lacks stripes and is spotted instead. The coat colour varies geographically, but, in general, is a rufous red in juveniles and chestnut in females. There are white facial markings, as well as several stripes and spots all over, though they are only faintly visible. White patches can be seen on the throat, near the head and the chest. A pair of inguinal scent glands are present. The coats of males darken with age, becoming gray to dark brown. Males develop a rough and scraggy mane, usually brown in colour, and a white dorsal stripe. There is a chevron between the eyes of the males. The body and legs of this antelope are specially adapted to its swampy habitat. The hooves of the male are elongated and widely splayed. The rubbery, shaggy, water-repellent coat is minimally affected by slimy and muddy vegetation. The wedge-like shape and lowering of the head, coupled with the backward bend of the horns (in males) provides for easy navigation through dense vegetation. The pasterns are flexible, and the hooves, banana-like in shape, can reach a length of up to in the hindlegs and in the forelegs. The pointed toes allow it to walk slowly and almost noiselessly through the water. Moreover, the colour of the coat provides an excellent camouflage. Hearing is acute, and the ears are so structured that the animal can accurately determine the direction from where a sound has originated. This adaptation is of profound use in habitats where long sight is of very little value due to the density and darkness of the environment. Ecology and behaviour Sitatunga standing in water Sitatunga are active mainly during the early hours after dawn, the last one or two hours before dusk, and at night, and spend a large part of this time feeding. Basically sedentary, they rest in flat areas and reed beds, especially during the hotter part of the day. They seldom leave their swamp habitat during the daytime. Though sitatunga commonly form pairs or remain solitary, larger groups have also been observed. A study in Kenya recorded a herd of as many as nine individuals, comprising an adult male, four females and four juveniles. Loose groups may be formed but interaction among individuals is very low. Individuals generally associate only with their own sex. The sitatunga is not territorial. Males may engage in locking horns with other males and attacking vegetation using their horns. They may perform feinting by raising their forelegs with the hindlegs rooted in the ground as a threat display. Sitatunga interact with each other by first touching their noses, which may be followed by licking each other and nibbling. Alarmed animals may stand motionless, with the head held high and one leg raised. Sitatunga may occasionally emit a series of coughs or barks, usually at night, which may cause other animals to join in, and these sounds can be heard across the swamp. This barking may be used by females to warn off other females. Males often utter a low bellow on coming across a female or a herd of females in the mating season. A low-pitched squeak may be uttered while feeding. Mothers communicate with their calves by bleats. Sitatunga can feed or rest close to southern lechwe herds, but do not interact with them. They often attract yellow-billed oxpeckers, African jacanas and great egrets. Sitatunga are good swimmers, but limit themselves to water with profuse vegetation in order to escape crocodiles. In some cases, for instance when troubled by flies or pursued by predators, the sitatunga might fully submerge themselves in the water except for the nose and the eyes, which they keep slightly above the water surface. Due to its close association with water, the sitatunga are often described as \\"aquatic antelopes\\", like the waterbuck. They often dry themselves under the sun after feeding in water. Predators of the sitatunga include lions, wild dogs, crocodiles and leopards. =Diet= Sitatunga are selective and mixed feeders. They feed mainly on new foliage, fresh grasses, sedges and browse. Preferred plants include: bullrushes (Typha), sedges (Cyperus), aquatic grasses (Vossia, Echinochloa, Pennisetum, Leersia, Acroceras and Panicum. Species in Umbelliferae and Acanthaceae are preferred in Saiwa Swamp National Park (Kenya), and Fabaceae species are preferred in Bangweulu and Busanga (in Kafue National Park). They feed mostly in the wetland fringes. Diet preferences may vary seasonally in swamps where water levels change notably. Like the gerenuk, the sitatunga may stand on its hindlegs to reach higher branches of trees, or even use its horns to pull down the branches. A study recorded forty major species eaten by the animal, the majority of which were herbs. Sweet potato was the most preferred crop. The study predicted an increase in preference for crops due to seasonal food variations. Another study showed that annual floods affect the seasonal movement and diet of the species. These floods force the animals out of the reed beds onto the flooded grasslands when the water levels are high. At low water levels the cattle take over the flooded plains and send the sitatunga back to their original place. =Reproduction= Juvenile sitatunga in Salzburg Zoo, Austria Females are sexually mature by one year of age, while males take one-and-a-half-year before they mature. Breeding occurs throughout the year. When females gather, the males compete among each other for the right to mate, showing polygyny in males. The rutting male approaches the female in a lower bending posture, sniffing her vulva. The female may move slowly or react nervously. Even if the female flees, the male continues pursuing her steadily, without showing any sign of hurry. A receptive female will raise her head with her mouth wide open, following which the male will begin attempts at mounting. At the time of mounting the female lowers her head, while the male first bends and then straightens his forelegs and rests his head and neck on her back. The two remain together for one or two days, during which time the male ensures that no other male can approach the female. Gestation lasts for nearly eight months, after which generally a single calf is born. Parturition occurs throughout the year, though a peak may occur in the dry season. Calves are hidden adroitly, and brought out of cover only in the presence of many other sitatunga. The mother gazes and nods at the calf to summon it for nursing. A calf follows its mother about even after she has given birth to another calf. The mother suckles and licks her calf for about six months. The calf takes time to master the specialised gait of the sitatunga, and thus often loses its balance and falls in water. Males, and even some females, have been observed to leave their herds even before reaching sexual maturity due to intrasexual competition. Lifespan recorded in captivity averages 22 to 23 years. Habitat and distribution The sitatunga is an amphibious antelope (meaning it can live on both land and water) confined to swampy and marshy habitats. They occur in tall and dense vegetation of perennial as well as seasonal swamps, marshy clearings in forests, riparian thickets and mangrove swamps. Sitatunga move along clearly marked tracks in their swampy habitat, often leading to reed beds. These tracks, up to wide, can lead to feeding grounds and nearby riverine forests. The sitatunga hold small home ranges near water bodies In savannas, they are typically found in stands of papyrus and reeds (Phragmites species and Echinochloa pyramidalis). They share their habitat with the Nile lechwe in the Sudd swamps and with the southern lechwe in Angola, Botswana and Zambia. The sitatunga is native to Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. It is extinct in Niger, where it formerly occurred in the Lake Chad region, and is feared to be extinct in Togo, where its habitat has been taken over by dense human settlements. While it is localised and sporadic in western Africa, the sitatunga is still common in the forests of central Africa and certain swampy regions in central, eastern and southern Africa. Threats and conservation Habitat loss is the most severe threat to the survival of the sitatunga. Other threats include the increasing loss of wetlands, that has isolated populations; and long-term changes in the water level, that affects the nearby vegetation and thus bears upon their diet. Vast areas of Bangweulu and Busanga are burnt every year, placing animals like the sitatunga at grave risk given the inflammability of swamps. The sitatunga has been classified under the Least Concern category by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), and under Appendix III (Ghana) of the Washington Convention (CITES). In Senegal, intensive hunting for meat and habitat degradation have made the sitatunga very rare. Formerly it was common throughout Gambia, but now it is confined to a few inaccessible swamps; a population has been introduced in the Abuko Nature Reserve. On the other hand, though the animal is hunted by locals primarily for food, Botswana still supports a large portion of the total population. The species is of great economic significance for northern Botswana, that produces some of the world's biggest sitatunga trophies. Its status is unclear in Chad, Ghana, Guinea, Burundi and Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Significant populations still exist in countries such as Cameroon, Central African Republic, The Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Tanzania and Zambia. The inaccessibility of its habitat has rendered population estimates very difficult. In 1999, Rod East of the IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group estimated a total population of 170,000, but this is likely to be an overestimate. Its numbers are decreasing in areas of heavy human settlement, but are stable elsewhere. Around 40 percent of the populations (based on the overestimate of 170,000) occurs in protected areas, mainly in Okavango Delta and Linyanti and Chobe swamps (Botswana); Dja Faunal Reserve and Lob√©k√© National Park (Cameroon); Bangassou (Central African Republic); Odzala National Park, Lake T√©l√© Community Reserve, Likouala and Salonga National Park (The Democratic Republic of Congo); Monte Al√©n National Park (Equatorial Guinea); Saiwa Swamp National Park (Kenya); Akagera National Park (Rwanda); Moyowosi and Kigosi Game Reserves (Tanzania); Bangweulu and Busanga Swamps (Zambia). However, only a few are of these parks and reserves are well-protected and managed.

Foundation as the Gen'y≈çsha A Gen'y≈çsha memorial In 1881, the Koy≈çsha changed its direction again. This time, the declared aims of the Gen'y≈çsha were \\"to honor the Imperial Family, respect the Empire and to guard the rights of the people\\". However, its true agenda was to agitate for Japanese military expansion and conquest of the Asian continent. The true agenda was reflected in its new name of Gen'y≈çsha, taken after the Genkainada strait which separates Japan from Korea.Victor, The Pearl Harbor Myth, Rethinking the Unthinkable, page 128 The tactics which the Gen'y≈çsha was prepared to use to achieve its goals were also far from peaceful. It began as a terrorist organization, and although it continued to recruit disaffected ex- samurai, it also attracted figures involved in organized crime to assist in its campaigns of violence and assassination against foreigners and liberal politicians.Crowdey, The Enemy Within, page 217 In 1889, the Gen'y≈çsha strongly criticized the unequal treaty revision plan drafted by foreign minister ≈åkuma Shigenobu. A Gen'y≈çsha member threw a bomb which wounded him severely.Gordon, A Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa Times to the Present, page 92 In the election of 1892, the Gen'y≈çsha mounted a campaign of intimidation and violence with the tacit support of the Matsukata administration to influence the outcome of the election. One of the primary targets of the Gen'y≈çsha were the many Chinese secret societies, some of which were very hostile to Japan. However, the Chinese secret societies had a shared goal with the Gen'y≈çsha in wanting the overthrow of the Qing dynasty.Harries, Soldiers of the Sun, The Rise and Fall of the Imperial Japanese Army In 1881, Mitsuru T≈çyama sent over 100 men into China to gather information and to infiltrate these secret societies. One of the first and most detailed histories of the secret societies was written by Gen'y≈çsha member Hiraya Amane, who assisted in the establishment of the Gen'y≈çsha's Chinese headquarters in Hangzhou. The Gen'y≈çsha not only provided funds and weapons to the secret societies, but also arranged for refuge in Japan for leaders targeted by the Qing government. The Gen'yosha established a large network of brothels across China (and later throughout Southeast Asia) to provide meeting locations, and also to gather information. In addition to being a profitable side-business, the brothels provided opportunities to gather useful information for the later blackmail or subversion of patrons. However, although blackmail and bribery were often resorted to, more often information was obtained by employing prostitutes highly skilled in extracting information from their clients. The Gen'y≈çsha even established a training school for such agents in Sapporo in Hokkaid≈ç. Another sphere of Gen'y≈çsha activity was Korea. The Gen'y≈çsha established a task force to prepare detailed topographical survey maps of Korea in secret, in anticipation of a future Japanese invasion. The Gen'y≈çsha also actively supported the Donghak Peasant Movement, knowing that the uprising was likely to draw China and Japan into a war. The assassination of Queen Min of Korea in 1895 is believed to have been conducted by Gen'yosha members, at the instigation of the Japanese Minister in Seoul, Miura Gor≈ç.Min, The Last Empress, page 203 Originally ignored by the Japanese military, during the First Sino-Japanese War and Russo-Japanese War, both the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy found the Gen'y≈çshas extensive intelligence gathering network throughout East Asia to be invaluable. The Gen'y≈çsha network was also useful for the military in conducting sabotage activities behind enemy lines. After the annexation of Korea in 1910, the Gen'y≈çsha continued to support efforts towards Pan- Asianism. Domestically, it formed a political party called the Dai Nippon Seisant≈ç (\\"Greater Japan Production Party\\") to combat the influence of socialism in worker trade unions. Towards its later years, the Gen'y≈çsha was far removed from its origins as a secret society, but had evolved almost to the mainstream of Japanese politics. A number of cabinet ministers and members of the Japanese Diet were known members, and mainstream political leaders, such as Hirota K≈çki and Nakano Seig≈ç emerged from its ranks. It continued to exert considerable influence on the politics and foreign policy of Japan until the end of World War II. The Gen'y≈çsha was disbanded by the American authorities during the Occupation of Japan. Legacy The Gen'y≈çsha was the forerunner of a number of organizations which inherited and developed its ideology. It also set the stage for the post-World War II ties between right- wing politicians and yakuza organized crime syndicates. Although modern yakuza share many of Gen'y≈çsha's political and social philosophies, and although many of Gen'y≈çsha's members were drawn from yakuza ranks, the Gen'y≈çsha was primarily a political organization that often used criminal means to attain its goals, and was not a yakuza itself, as some authors have claimed.

She won a silver medal in 1993 in Stavern, Norway and a bronze medal in 1999 in Boden, Sweden (both 70 kg). At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens she placed 5th in the 72 kg women's freestyle. She retired from competition a year after the Athens Games. Nordhagen first started winning titles at Canada‚Äôs first national championship in 1992. When she began competing at world championships in 1993, there were fewer than 150 Canadian women registered in wrestling. By the time she retired, there were more than 4,000 women, not counting non- registered girls at the high-school level, registered in wrestling, according to Greg Mathieu, executive director of the Canadian Amateur Wrestling Association. Nordhagen helped get the women‚Äôs side of the sport into the Olympics for the first time at Athens in 2004, where she finished fifth. Upringing and Motivation Nordhagen says she never ran well using hate as emotional fuel, as some athletes do. Her modus operandi involved a smile of confidence and the work ethic of a girl raised on a farm where the labours did not have genders. > \\"In a farm family, there‚Äôs a different perspective,\\" she said. \\"I had a > mother who did everything my father did, because on a grain and cattle farm, > things have to get done. . . .

In 2006, besides maintaining a busy schedule as a motivational speaker and role model for students (under the sponsorship of Alberta oil and gas companies), Nordhagen began coaching Canadian junior women. Hall of Fame On June 26, 2006, Nordhagen‚Äôs husband and longtime coach, Leigh Vierling, received a phone call to inform Christine that she had been voted into the class of 2006 inductees to the international wrestling hall of fame. She became the first Canadian and first woman to be named to the hall by the Federation Internationale de Luttes Associees (FILA), wrestling's international and Olympic governing body. The ceremony was scheduled to take place during the world wrestling championships September 23 to October 2 at Guangzhou, China. The permanent display of honorees is housed at the Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Nordhagen was inducted into the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame & Museum in May 2010 for her achievements in Wrestling.

Situated near the mouth of the Fox River, on the east bank as it flows into Green Bay, the park contains rides, concessions, a roller coaster, and a food pavilion. Dances, movies, and other events are held in a pavilion. The park is adjacent to the Bay Beach Wildlife Sanctuary.  History  The park's history dates to the 1890s when entrepreneur Mitchell Nejedlo purchased the land. Originally intended to be divided and sold for summer cottages, he turned it into Bay View Beach. Bay View Beach had a dance hall, a bar, and a bathhouse, however, because it was swampy and infested with mosquitoes, the park didn't attract many visitors. In 1908 Captain John Cusick bought the resort from Nejedlo. Cusick built an 8-foot dock that extended 570 feet into the bay, then bought a steamboat to transport customers from Walnut Street Bridge to Bay View Beach. When swimming became popular, Cusick began renting swimsuits for $0.10. On a good day, he could bring in as much as $450. In 1901 a roller coaster was built. Then in 1908, Cusick built a ride called \\"Shoot the Chutes\\", a flat- bottomed boat that could hold 12 people. The boat was slid down a 50-foot ramp and onto the water. The ride cost $0.10. In 1911 Bay View Beach was sold to Frank Emery Murphy, born 1862 (Green Bay Alderman, corporate executive of Murphy Lumber, Murphy Supply, Morley - Murphy Company, and owner of the prestigious Horse Shoe Bay Farms in Door County, Wisconsin) and Fred A. Rahr born 1863, (Green Bay Alderman, operator of Rahr's Brewing Company, Treasurer of the Green Bay Volunteer Fire Department when it was organized in 1887). In 1920 they donated the 11 acres, along with all its buildings and attractions, to the city of Green Bay to be used as a City Park, Called Bay Beach Park.Tim Freiss. Haunted Green Bay. Charleston, SC: History Press, 2010. From the site's earliest days as a private park, a public beach was available, but pollution of the bay eventually caused the swimming beach to close. From the 1930s to the early 1970s, Bay Beach's pavilion hosted concerts, political rallies, dances, Fourth of July fireworks, and other events. On August 9, 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited Bay Beach in celebration of Green Bay's tercentennial of the landing of French explorer Jean Nicolet in 1634. Today the park is a family place, with scenic views and rides for children, including bumper cars, two small-scale passenger train rides, a large slide, and a Ferris wheel. = Upgrades = Zippin Pippin 2013 opening morning In 2006, of land west of the Bay Beach boundary was purchased to upgrade and expand the park. Plans include tearing down and replacing the original Ferris wheel, replacing the Scat with a new ride, and expanding the train tracks to circle the enlarged acreage. On March 2, 2010, the city of Green Bay approved the purchase of the nearly century-old Zippin Pippin wooden roller coaster from Memphis, Tennessee, where it had sat derelict for five years. A groundbreaking took place on August 25, 2010, and construction on the Zippin Pippin began in September 2010. Construction was completed in April 2011 and the Zippin Pippin is now open. In early 2013, a Bay Beach Master Plan was proposed. Phase 1 of the plan is broken into five two-year segments.

He started his career in 1964 at Blackpool before moving to Liverpool in 1967. He made 665 appearances for Liverpool, and captained the side to four league titles and an FA Cup victory in the 1970s. Added to these domestic honours were two European Cups, including Liverpool's first in 1977; and two UEFA Cup titles. Hughes won the Football Writers' Player of the Year in 1977. Hughes completed a full set of English football domestic honours by winning the League Cup with Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1980. In addition to Wolves, he later played for Rotherham United, Hull City, Mansfield Town and Swansea City. Hughes earned 62 caps for the England national team, which he also captained. After retiring from football he worked as a media personality, mainly with the BBC. He was made an OBE in 1980 for his services to sport. Hughes died of a brain tumour, aged 57, in 2004. Early life Emlyn Hughes was the son of Fred Hughes, a Great Britain, Wales, Barrow, and Workington Town rugby league footballer.David Lawrenson (2007). \\"The Rugby League Miscellany [Page-6]\\". Vision Sport Publishing. Career =Blackpool: 1964‚Äì1967= After being refused a trial by local side Barrow, Hughes joined Blackpool, then a first division side. He made his debut for Blackpool in 1964 playing alongside Jimmy Armfield and Alan Ball, initially as an inside forward, but later at left-half. =Liverpool: 1967‚Äì1979= 1960s In February 1967, after 28 appearances for Blackpool, Hughes joined Liverpool for ¬£65,000 (). Manager Bill Shankly was stopped in his car by the police as he drove Hughes to Liverpool for the first time and said \\"Don't you know who I've got in this car? The captain of England!\\" The policeman peered through the window and said that he didn't recognise the man, to which Shankly replied: \\"No, but you will!\\" Hughes did indeed go on to captain his country. Hughes made his Liverpool debut in a 2‚Äì1 league win over Stoke City at Anfield on 4 March 1967. He scored his first goal in a 6‚Äì0 defeat of Newcastle United at Anfield on 26 August the same year. Hughes settled into the midfield at Liverpool during a transitional period for the club, earning the nickname Crazy Horse after an illegal rugby tackle on Newcastle United winger Albert Bennett. Liverpool did not win any honours in his first four seasons there but Hughes was seen as a forerunner of the future which Shankly had in mind. His versatility was noticed too ‚Äì he filled in at left back and central defence, a trait which was spotted by England coach Alf Ramsey in 1969. Ramsey gave Hughes his debut on 5 November of that year, playing him at left back in a friendly against the Netherlands in the Olympic Stadium, Amsterdam. England won 1‚Äì0. He played in the next game in the same position. Hughes scored his only international goal against Wales, the opening goal of a 3‚Äì0 British Home Championship victory at Ninian Park in 1972. 1970 For Hughes, 1970 was an important year in his career. After Liverpool were humiliated by Second division side Watford in the quarter finals of the FA Cup, Shankly made a decision to clear out many of the senior players who had in the previous eight years won two League Championship titles, an FA Cup, and reached a European Cup Winners Cup final, and recruit younger players to replace them. Hughes, not yet 23, survived the cull, together with Ian Callaghan and Tommy Smith, and the new recruits who would help establish Liverpool's dominance in the 1970s began to arrive. Meanwhile, England were about to fly to Mexico and defend the World Cup won four years earlier. Hughes had six caps by the time Ramsey included him in his provisional squad of 27 which flew to South America for altitude-acclimatising friendly games against Colombia and Ecuador. Hughes featured in neither game, but was selected in the final squad of 22. He was the youngest player selected by Ramsey, and the only Liverpool player in the squad. Along with Nobby Stiles, Hughes was one of only two outfield players who did not feature in any game. England progressed to the quarter finals, where they were defeated by West Germany. Questions were raised about Ramsey's decisions during the game. He controversially withdrew Bobby Charlton and Martin Peters in the second half, but retained a clearly exhausted Terry Cooper, who played at left back the entire 120 minutes although Hughes was available to replace him. Hughes would ultimately never play in a World Cup. 1970‚Äì1971 In the 1970‚Äì71 season, Liverpool reached the FA Cup final, losing 2‚Äì1 after extra-time to Arsenal, who completed the then-rare double of League title and FA Cup. Hughes was distraught as he collected his loser's medal, and BBC commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme remarked: \\"Emlyn Hughes there, really absolutely sick.\\" By this time, Hughes had established a reputation for charging upfield from his defensive midfield position on long runs, and for constantly berating referees. 1972 In 2008, Tommy Smith claimed in his autobiography that on 8 May 1972, Hughes told him that he had been speaking to a number of Arsenal players who were \\"willing to throw a match for ¬£50 a man.\\" Liverpool subsequently failed to win the vital match at Highbury, which allowed Derby County to snatch the title instead. Smith wrote that he was disgusted with what Hughes said and never spoke to him outside the field again. Smith maintained that the only witness was Ian Callaghan. Smith also stated that he thinks Hughes was trying to set him up and was not really trying to bribe Arsenal players. Smith said he never told Shankly because it would have \\"broken his heart\\".Anfield Iron ‚Äì Tommy Smith (2008) When Saturday Comes ‚Äì Reviews/64-Players/1015 ‚Äì Anfield Iron wes.co.uk Retrieved 3 February 2014 Hughes appeared again for England in the quarter-final of the 1972 European Championships, again under Ramsey, again facing West Germany, again with the same result; victory for West Germany. 1973‚Äì1974 In 1973, Hughes won his first League Championship title with Liverpool FC and his first European honour with the UEFA Cup, against Borussia M√∂nchengladbach. After scoring goals in a memorable win over Merseyside rivals Everton at Goodison Park, Hughes was made Liverpool captain after Tommy Smith had a publicised falling-out with Shankly, who nonetheless kept him in the team. Smith and Hughes' off-field relationship, already strained due to the bribery incident 18 months before, fractured beyond all repair after this, although it never visibly affected their football. In October 1973, Ramsey selected Hughes to be left back as England hosted Poland at Wembley. Victory would secure a place at the 1974 World Cup finals, but anything else would take Poland through. England dominated the match but were denied constantly by Polish goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski. Then Poland had a breakaway after a misplaced tackle by Norman Hunter in the second half, and only Hughes and goalkeeper Peter Shilton were back to defend. The ball was passed to Jan Domarski who shot from the edge of the area. Hughes lunged into a last-ditch tackle but Domarski's shot evaded his block and slipped under the body of Shilton and into the net. England equalised through an Allan Clarke penalty but was unable to score again. At the end of the 1973‚Äì74 season, Liverpool reached the FA Cup final and beat Newcastle United 3‚Äì0, with Hughes receiving the trophy from The Princess Anne. Later that month Hughes was also appointed England captain ‚Äì as successor to Bobby Moore ‚Äì by caretaker boss Joe Mercer. Hughes led out England for the first time on 11 May 1974 against Wales in Cardiff, which England won 2‚Äì0. 1975 Hughes captained England for all of Mercer's seven games in charge, and initially maintained the role when Don Revie was appointed as Ramsey's permanent successor. However, after the first two qualifiers for the 1976 European Championships, Revie dropped Hughes from the team, giving the captaincy to Hughes' former Blackpool teammate Alan Ball. With Liverpool under the guidance of Bob Paisley following Shankly's retirement, Hughes focused on club football. Liverpool won nothing in 1975, but achieved another League Championship and UEFA Cup double in 1976. 1977 The 1976‚Äì77 season began with a shock recall to England by Don Revie, who played Hughes in the second qualifier for the 1978 World Cup, under national captain and clubmate Kevin Keegan. Hughes was now predominantly a central defender, and played in a tactically disastrous team against Italy in Rome, which marked the lowest point of Revie's tenure as England manager. England lost 2‚Äì0. Revie selected Hughes for further games through the early part of 1977, during which time Liverpool sought an unprecedented treble of League Championship, FA Cup and European Cup. They won the title but lost the FA Cup final to bitter rivals Manchester United. Four days later, Hughes captained Liverpool to a 3‚Äì1 win over Borussia M√∂nchengladbach in Rome to win the 1977 European Cup Final, the first time the team won Europe's most prestigious club title. He was voted the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year. 1978‚Äì1979 Revie gave Hughes the England captaincy back for a Home International match against Scotland when Keegan was unavailable, before selecting him for the squad which would tour South America in the summer. On returning to England, Ron Greenwood took over as England manager, returning the captaincy to Hughes. England could not qualify for the World Cup after a defeat by Italy, but Hughes nonetheless celebrated a 50th cap when England beat the Italians 2‚Äì0 in the final qualifier at Wembley at the end of 1977. In 1978, Hughes was in the Liverpool team which played and lost its first ever League Cup final, to Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest in a replay. The league title went to Forest too, but Liverpool retained the European Cup with a 1‚Äì0 win over FC Bruges at Wembley, allowing Hughes to lift the trophy for a second consecutive year. By this time Hughes's place in the side was under threat from talented young Scottish defender Alan Hansen, who had arrived the previous season for ¬£100,000 from Partick Thistle. The following season Hughes made just 16 appearances in the side, enough to earn his final title medal. Liverpool lost to Manchester United in the FA Cup semi- finals, with Hughes caught out of position for the winning goal. He never played for Liverpool again. He was sold to Wolverhampton Wanderers for ¬£90,000 in August 1979. Hughes left Liverpool after 665 appearances, scoring 49 goals, for the club. His 59 appearances for England while at Liverpool made him the club's most capped player until Welsh striker Ian Rush broke the record more than ten years later. =Wolverhampton Wanderers: 1979‚Äì1981= Hughes made his Wolves debut at the Baseball Ground on Wednesday, 22 August 1979 in a 1‚Äì0 win over Derby County. He went on to win the League Cup in his first season with Wolves ‚Äì the only trophy he did not win with Liverpool ‚Äì lifting it as captain after a 1‚Äì0 win over Nottingham Forest at Wembley. He continued to be selected for England squads even after leaving Liverpool. He featured sporadically in England's successful qualifying campaign for the 1980 European Championships, he captained the team for the final time in the 1‚Äì1 1980 Home International game with Northern Ireland draw at Wembley, and won his 62nd and final cap against Scotland in the next game as a substitute. Greenwood included him in the squad for the European Championship finals in Italy as an experienced reserve, but Hughes ultimately did not play and England were eliminated in the group stages. Hughes was England's only connection with their previous foray into the finals of a tournament ‚Äì the 1970 World Cup ‚Äì but his non- participation in either made him England's most capped player never to feature in a major finals. He also became only the fifth player to represent England in three separate decades, joining Jesse Pennington, Stanley Matthews, Bobby Charlton and Peter Shilton. The 57 caps Hughes earned in the 1970s make him the most capped England player of that decade. =Rotherham United: 1981‚Äì1983= Hughes left Wolves in 1981, joining Rotherham United as player- manager. Inheriting a side that had won the Third Division championship under Ian Porterfield, including such players as John Breckin, Tony Towner and Ronnie Moore, Rotherham made a patchy start to the season and were in the relegation zone in January. However, a run of nine wins in a row followed and Rotherham climbed from third last to third place in the league. Promotion was missed by four points, but the finish of 7th place was the Millers' highest since the 1960s. The following season Rotherham appeared to be holding their ground in the Second Division and were 9th at the start of 1983. However, the side plummeted down the table. On the morning of 20 March Hughes was asked to resign as manager. He refused and was sacked, to be replaced by George Kerr the following day. Rotherham were relegated, as they won only one more game afterwards. =Later football career= Hughes also played for Hull City, later becoming a director. He joined Mansfield Town briefly in 1983, but did not make any appearances for the Stags. Later that year he also turned out for Swansea City, with whom he brought his playing career to a close. Post- football career In 1979, Hughes became a team captain on the long-running BBC quiz A Question of Sport, opposite the former rugby union footballer Gareth Edwards. He left the programme in 1981, but returned in 1984, this time playing against England's former rugby union captain Bill Beaumont. Hughes became much-mimicked for his competitive nature and high-pitched protestations when not being able to recall an answer. He once identified a picture of a heavily muddied jockey as John Reid, only to be told it was Princess Anne. Later in the same series, she appeared on the programme, joining Hughes's team. Hughes caused a minor national debate when he defied protocol and put his arm around her. He called her \\"ma'am\\" throughout. Hughes later joined her team for the much-criticised It's a Royal Knockout project, the brainchild of her brother Prince Edward. Hughes' involvement with the BBC also included work as an analyst on radio. Alongside Peter Jones he was present at the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985, saying \\"Football has died and the hooligans have won.\\" He also was a member of the punditry panel for BBC Television's coverage of the 1986 FIFA World Cup. Hughes hosted the short-lived BBC game show Box Clever during 1986 and 1987. However, he left A Question of Sport ‚Äì and the corporation as a whole ‚Äì in 1987 to go to ITV and captain a team on Sporting Triangles. Through this, he occasionally appeared as a pundit on ITV's football coverage. He was also immortalised in comic strip form as he was signed by Melchester Rovers in the Roy of the Rovers strip; he also wrote a column for the teenage football magazine Match. Alongside Peter Jones again, he was present at the Hillsborough disaster in April 1989. Later, he paid visits to the parents of Andrew Devine, who was left comatose after the tragedy, in hospital and offered them support and help.Hillsborough remembered. Mirror, 11 April 2009 Final years In later years, Hughes lived a quiet retirement, occasionally working as an after-dinner or motivational speaker. In 1992, he appeared on an episode of GamesMaster promoting the football video game which carried his name, Emlyn Hughes International Soccer. From March 2002, he became a presenter and pundit on the nightly football phone-in on Real Radio Yorkshire. From 1995 Hughes became chief patron to the Sheffield based charity F.A.B.L.E. (For A Better Life with Epilepsy). In 2003, it was announced that he was suffering from a brain tumour, for which he underwent surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Hughes was married to Barbara and had a son and daughter, both named after him (Emlyn Jr. and Emma Lynn). His last public appearance was at the 2004 Grand National, seven months before his death; he was interviewed on BBC Grandstand as an owner of Mantles Prince, one of the runners. He died at his home in Dore, Sheffield, at the age of 57. A minute's silence was held the following evening at Anfield before Liverpool's game against Middlesbrough in the League Cup. His funeral service took place at Sheffield Cathedral. Legacy A statue of Hughes outside Emlyn Hughes House, Barrow-in-Furness Eight days after Hughes' death, England players wore black armbands in a friendly against Spain. England forward Wayne Rooney attracted controversy after throwing his black armband to the floor, following a 42nd minute substitution for Alan Smith. Rooney later apologised. Hughes was voted at No.10 on the official Liverpool Football Club web site poll \\"100 Players Who Shook The Kop\\". A statue of Hughes was unveiled in his birthplace of Barrow-in-Furness in 2008, it is placed in front of a new office building on Abbey Road which was also named after him. A cancer support charity in Hughes' name is run by the Freemasons of Tapton Masonic Hall in Sheffield, of which Hughes was a member. Hughes is also remembered at Anfield, a statue of him being carried off by Liverpool legend Bob Paisley was unveiled in 2020. Awards In 1980, Hughes was decorated with the OBE for services to football, and later featured on the television tribute show This Is Your Life. On 24 July 2008 it was announced that Hughes would be inducted into the National Football Museum's Hall of Fame. The National Football Museum in Preston started its Hall of Fame in 2002 with the inductees chosen by a selection panel that included Gordon Banks, Sir Trevor Brooking, Sir Alex Ferguson, Sir Bobby Charlton, Jack Charlton, Mark Lawrenson and Gary Lineker. The awards were presented at the annual ceremony, held at the Millennium Mayfair Hotel in London on 18 September.

The Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie (Flemish Radio and Television Broadcasting Organisation), or VRT (), is the national public- service broadcaster for the Flemish Community of Belgium.  History  VRT is the successor to the Nationaal Instituut voor de Radio-omroep (NIR, 1930‚Äì60), Belgische Radio- en Televisieomroep (BRT, 1960‚Äì1991), and Belgische Radio- en Televisieomroep Nederlandstalige Uitzendingen (BRTN, 1991‚Äì1998). The NIR (known as the INR in French) and BRT (RTB in French) had each been single state-owned entities with separate Dutch- and French-language production departments. However, in 1977, as part of the ongoing state reform in Belgium broadcasting became reserved to the language communities rather than the national government in 1977. Accordingly, BRT/RTB went their separate ways in 1977. While the former French half changed its name to RTBF in 1977, the Dutch side retained the BRT name until becoming BRTN in 1991. However, the two broadcasters share production facilities on Auguste Reyerslaan (French: Boulevard Auguste Reyers) in Brussels. The final renaming to VRT, on 1 January 1998, followed a change in the organization's legal status: from being part of a semi-governmental entity (a parastatale in Belgian terminology) it had, on 16 April 1997, became a publicly owned corporation (NV van publiek recht) in its own right. As successors to the NIR/INR, VRT and its counterpart in the French Community of Belgium, RTBF, share the Belgian membership in the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) ‚Äì an association of public broadcasters in the countries of Europe and the Mediterranean rim that, amongst other activities, organizes the annual Eurovision Song Contest. With the ending of its television monopoly ‚Äì marked by the creation of VTM, a commercial television company that initially captured more than half of VRT's audience ‚Äì the public broadcaster has been compelled to fight back, and part of its successful response has been the use of external production houses such as Woestijnvis, the creator of such formats as The Mole (De mol) and ' (Man bijt hond).

Since then, it has been replaced or supplanted in every branch of the U.S. Armed Forces. BDU-style uniforms and derivatives still see widespread use in other countries (some of them being former U.S. surplus stocks transferred under U.S. security assistance programs), while others are still worn by some U.S. federal, state and local law enforcement agencies or activities who may work in tactical situations, such as the DEA FAST and SWAT teams. As late as 2014, BDUs were worn by officers of the U.S. Public Health Service as the prescribed uniform for deployment, but have since been replaced by a variant of the U.S. Coast Guard's Operational Dress Uniform. Background A man and woman modelling early prototypes of the BDU in 1980 While the Italian Army was the first military organization to issue camouflaged clothing, albeit in limited numbers, the Germans were noted for their efforts in this field before the Second World War. After much trial, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (abbrev. OKW) authorized Heeres-Splittermuster 31, more commonly known as \\"splinter pattern\\", for use in shelter-quarters (Zeltbahnen) in the 1930s. In 1940, SS-Verf√ºgungstruppe (abbrev. SS-VT; renamed Waffen-SS) designed, tested and issued its own distinctive patterns and layout not long after. The United States Marine Corps received its first military camouflage pattern in 1942, when the reversible, beach-jungle, three- and five-color frog-skin pattern uniform was issued, based on a 1940 trial design. The pattern was mostly employed in the Pacific Theatre, but was not found to be particularly effective and in the European Theatre the pattern was withdrawn altogether in 1944‚Äîin part because of anticipated friendly fire incidents after D-Day, due to its similarity to the Waffen SS's pattern (not to be confused with Flecktarn, a post-war design). Camouflaged helmet covers and shelters were issued in the 1950s in \\"wine leaf\\" and \\"brown cloud\\" patterns. The U.S. Army also tried a lesser-known camouflage uniform on D-Day and throughout the Normandy operations, like the Marine Corps' uniforms, but it was replaced by the M43 uniform before being used much. During the Vietnam War, the United States Armed Forces' four-color ERDL pattern saw limited use among specialist units in the U.S. Army, though most were issued the solid olive green OG107 sateens or jungle fatigues, while the Marines adopted the pattern service-wide after 1968. The ERDL pattern fatigues were identical in cut to the third-pattern OD jungle fatigues, and were available in both a highland pattern (more brown), and a lowland pattern (more green), though the lowland pattern was eventually phased out. Other, unofficial, patterns utilized in Vietnam included black-dyed or spray painted jungle fatigues, often used by special purpose forces, and various Vietnamese Tigerstripe patterns (themselves being based on French Army airborne and Foreign Legion patterns and a British design utilized in Malaysia), or commercial \\"duck hunter\\" patterns. The general design and configuration of the U.S. BDU uniform was similar to that of Vietnam War's jungle fatigues, which were in turn similar in configuration to specialty uniforms worn by U.S. paratroopers during World War II. History Woodland camouflage (in near infrared) First issued in limited number to garrison leaders, officers and generals to all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces in September 1981 for replacement of the long worn and aging Olive Drab colored uniforms or OG-107, the following month, the Battle Dress Uniform began field issue military wide.http://www.olive-drab.com/od_soldiers_clothing_bdu_.php. Since 1981, changes included the addition and subsequent elimination of buttoned waist adjustment tabs, the size reduction of the collar, and refinements in stitching and fit. BDUs were initially only issued in a 50/50 nylon and cotton twill blend, called the Temperate Weather BDU, or TWBDU. Complaints regarding the heat retention of these uniforms, especially following the invasion of Grenada in 1983, led to the introduction of the Hot Weather BDU, the HWBDU. The Hot Weather BDU coat and trousers were constructed of 100 percent ripstop cotton, in a four-color woodland camouflage pattern. However, after complaints of shorter wear and frayed cuffs, along with requirements imposed by unit commanders to starch the all-cotton uniform for parade, the Enhanced Hot Weather BDU (EHWBDU) replaced the HWBDU commencing in 1996. The EHWBDU's components are made with 50/50 ripstop nylon and cotton poplin blend. BDUs were printed with infrared-brightened dyes. Near infrared (NIR) Signature Management Technology is used in the uniforms to help prevent detection by NIR Image Converters. These photocathode devices do not detect temperatures, but rather infrared radiation variances. NIR-compliant uniforms use a special fabric that allows soldiers to appear at the same radiation level as the surrounding terrain, thus making them more difficult to detect. It is advised not to use starch when cleaning or ironing BDUs, since starch weakens the fabric and ruins the infrared protective coating. A pair of BDUs that has been starched even once should not be worn in combat. The tropical weight uniform was not as durable as the temperate weight uniform. The tropical uniform would only last for 4‚Äì6 months of use when rotating four uniforms for duty, while the temperate uniform would last over a year under the same conditions. =U.S. Army= All United States Army soldiers formally received their first batches of the BDU as its new field and garrison uniform in the temperate weight cut on October 1, 1981. In addition, Patrol caps, boonie hats and the M-65 jacket were issued in the new camouflage pattern in time, including a new light brown T-shirt and black webbed belt with brass buckle. The BDU was the first camouflage uniform approved by the U.S. Army since the Vietnam War, where the ERDL pattern was in limited use. The BDU soon replaced all earlier camouflage pattern uniforms for all wooded, jungle, and tropical environments, and by 1989, had completely replaced the standard olive drab uniforms that had been used since 1952. =U.S. Department of Defense= The BDU was worn by DoD civilians and DoD Police officers. =U.S. Marine Corps= The ERDL-patterned BDU was first introduced to the United States Marine Corps in 1977, as they phased out the olive green OG-107, which had been standard wear since the early 1950s. Originally, no nametapes were worn with the USMC's BDUs, which was officially referred to by the USMC as a \\"camouflage utility uniform\\" (CCU) during its usage. However, in October 1991,http://www.militarytraining.net/Cpl%20Course/Classes/Slide%20shows/CPL0106%20Inspection%20Preparation%20Sgt%20Stuart.ppt the USMC began the wearing of nametapes on their BDUs (and DCUs and DBDUs) in order to comply with NATO Standardization Agreement (STANAG), becoming mandatory by October 1992. In the USMC's case, a nametape bearing the wearer's last name was worn embroidered above the right pocket, and a nametape reading \\"U.S. MARINES\\" being embroidered was worn above the left pocket. The MCCUU which replaced the BDU continues this. The USMC's BDU was worn with a stenciled iron-on Eagle, Globe, and Anchor (EGA) centered on the wearer's left breast pocket, below the pocket flap. Early USMC BDUs featured \\"USMC\\" lettering below that EGA, however, that was discontinued later on, with only the EGA being used by the end of the BDU's tenure with the USMC. The EGA was ironed-on to the BDU blouse pocket by USMC recruits at the end of MCRD upon completion of their training to signify their christening as U.S. Marines. The same was done on the eight-pointed \\"utility cover\\" hat that was worn with the USMC's version of the BDU. The BDU's successor, the MCCUU, has the EGA embroidered instead of stenciled on the blouse's chest pocket and all hats. =U.S. Air Force= The U.S. Air Force initially only issued ERDL BDUs to combat arms units stationed overseas, such as United States Air Force Security Forces, Combat Controllers, and United States Air Force Pararescue, as of October 1981, the same time as the Army and Marines. The Air Force did not allow non combat arms to wear the woodland pattern BDU until the summer of 1987, and mandated them as the only \\"Fatigue\\" uniform in 1988. The BDU was no longer authorized for wear in the USAF on November 1, 2011. =U.S. Navy= Sailors of the United States Navy started issuing the BDU in the new woodland scheme and temperate cut the same time as the other branches. The U.S. Navy referred to the uniform as the \\"Camouflage Utility Uniform\\" (CUU) during its usage. =U.S. Coast Guard= Coast Guardsmen started issuing the new woodland BDU around the same time as the other service branches.  Successors  U.S. soldiers (from left to right) showcase the Army Combat Uniform (left), Desert Camouflage Uniform (center), and a World War II-era uniform (right), in May 2005 U.S. soldiers in 2006 wearing BDUs while on a training exercise in Louisiana; the BDU was authorized by the U.S. Army until 2008. The U.S. military has run trials of many camouflage patterns (some being used by foreign militaries), and issued environment-specific uniforms, notably the six-color Desert Battle Dress Uniform (DBDU), nicknamed the \\"chocolate chip camouflage\\", designed in 1962, and the \\"nighttime desert grid\\" (NCDBDU). Both uniforms were used in 1991, during the Persian Gulf War. These Desert BDUs were discontinued after the war. The Desert Camouflage Uniform (DCU) in three- color desert camouflage was introduced in 1992, and was utilized in operations in Somalia (1993); it was in service in Afghanistan and Iraq from the start of hostilities, but the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps have both replaced the DCU with newer uniforms (ACU and MCCUU, respectively). In testing, U.S. Army researchers found that, as in other environments, the color of desert terrain varies, and can range from pink to blue, depending on the minerals in the soil and the time of the day. Since patches of uniform color in the desert are usually 10 times larger than those in wooded areas, it was decided to alter the existing six-color DBDU pattern. This led to the development of a three- color pattern DCU, which was adopted. The BDU is made in various camouflage patterns by various manufacturers, such as in the MultiCam camouflage, which is in use today mainly by the public, public service persons, and some foreign military units. BDUs can be purchased from civilian vendors in the UCP pattern analogous to the ACU as well, but these are not authorized for wear by the U.S. Army's soldiers. =U.S. Marine Corps= The development of modern camouflage patterns and the rising desire of the various U.S. military branches to differentiate themselves from each other has resulted in new patterns for uniforms. The U.S. Marine Corps was the first branch to replace their BDUs. The Marine Corps Combat Utility Uniform (MCCUU) uses the computer- generated MARPAT pattern and several other enhancements. It was approved for wear in June 2001, became available for purchase in 2002, and the changeover was completed by October 1, 2004. Beyond that date, the BDU was authorized for wear until April 1, 2005 in limited exceptions for those small numbers of Marine Corps personnel who did not yet have the MCCUU. USMC Special Operations units (MARSOC) have recently issued M81 woodland-patterned uniforms to supplement MARPAT uniforms for special missions. =U.S. Army= A U.S. Army medical officer wears a BDU while examining a man's eyes in January 2000 In 2004, the U.S. Army unveiled the Army Combat Uniform (ACU), its successor to the BDU. From late 2005 to early 2008, the U.S. Army undertook the process of replacing the BDU with the ACU, with the BDU being formally discontinued by the Army in April 2008 (though most soldiers had been wearing the ACU for years by then). The Army Junior ROTC followed suit thereafter in 2009.lionsbattalion.weebly.com/uploads/8/7/2/8/8728410/how_to_wear_the_acu.ppt The original version of the ACU used a pixelated \\"digital\\" pattern known as the Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP). UCP is similar to MARPAT, but uses more neutral, less saturated colors. The neutral colors, primarily foliage green and sand yellow, are designed to be work best in desert, woodland, and urban combat situations. The ACU in UCP was used by the army in all environments except for areas with snow, as the UCP pattern works poorly against white despite the heavy use of grey. An all-white BDU and the ECWCS are used instead for winterized warfare. Beginning in 2014, the Army switched the ACU to use the Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP), as UCP was seen as inadequate in many environments. =U.S. Department of Defense= Civilian employees of the U.S. Department of Defense in combat zones began wearing the Airman Battle Uniform and Army Combat Uniform in place of the BDU (and its cousin DCU) after it was replaced. =U.S. Navy= From 2004 to 2007, the U.S. Navy began issuing a pixelated blue and gray \\"digital\\" pattern Navy Working Uniform (NWU) in limited quantities to some sailors on an experimental test basis. While the NWU is neither a tactical uniform nor a battle dress uniform, it is intended to take the place of many existing work ensembles (utilities, wash khaki, coveralls, M81 BDU, etc.). The disruptive pattern is primarily intended to complement U.S. Navy ship colors and to hide stains and wear, and supposedly to make the wearer a less obvious visual target for hostile forces while working aboard a naval vessel in port. To meet the Navy's cold-weather requirements, the NWU includes a fleece jacket, pullover sweater, and parka options. U.S. Navy SEALs, Seabees, and other U.S. Navy personnel deployed ashore under the cognizance of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command used \\"M81\\" woodland BDUs (referred to by the navy as CCUs)https://media.defense.gov/2017/Mar/06/2001707436/-1/-1/0/CI_1020_10A.PDF and DCUs for outdoor operations or activities in specific areas of responsibility (AOR), until the issuance of the NWU Type III in the AOR camouflage pattern. =U.S. Air Force= In 2004 and 2005, the U.S. Air Force experimented with, but rejected, a blue-toned tigerstripe uniform. In 2006, a new BDU-style uniform called the Airman Battle Uniform (ABU) was adopted, using a semi-pixelated tiger pattern with four soft earth tones consisting of tan, grey, green and blue. It failed, however, to incorporate many of the significant improvements of the ACU and MCCUU. By 2007, it was in current production. In 2008, responding to criticism that the new Airman Battle Uniform was too heavy and hot in high-temperature environments, the USAF's 648th Aeronautical Systems Squadron at Brooks City-Base revealed plans to switch to a lighter, more breathable fabric for the combat blouse section of the ABU. The original heavyweight nylon-cotton blend was changed to a lighter- weight nylon-cotton poplin material. Priority will go to those serving in the Middle East or other hot-weather theaters.Winn, Patrick, Better, Lighter ABU Blouse Is On The Way, Air Force Times, May 9, 2008 On May 4, 2016, the National Commander of the Civil Air Patrol announced the USAF's approval for the Civil Air Patrol to begin its transition to the Airman Battle Uniform. On May 14, 2018, the Air Force announced the adoption of the Army's Operational Camouflage Pattern uniform, however, insignia will be distinctive. Transition is to be complete by April 1, 2021. =U.S. Coast Guard= The U.S. Coast Guard has introduced the new Operational Dress Uniform (ODU) uniform in 2004 to replace the winter and summer \\"Undress Duty\\" uniform. Resembling the BDU, the ODU retains the basic design of the old-style BDU uniforms, but with the lower pockets on the blouse being eliminated. The sleeves can be worn \\"folded up\\" in a manner similar to the old U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force BDUs and the trousers \\"bloused\\" into the boots (unless boating shoes are worn, as is common for the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, which patrols for the Coast Guard aboard privately owned watercraft), with the ODU black belt and blackened buckle being worn with the metal tip two to four inches from the buckle. The ODU is also issued in a single blue color as opposed to any camouflage pattern. The BDU and DCU were formally retired by the USCG in 2012.https://media.defense.gov/2017/Mar/06/2001707436/-1/-1/0/CI_1020_10A.PDF The dark blue Coast Guard unit baseball-style cap is worn with this uniform. The ODU also has all of its allowable insignia sewn on, eliminating the chance of puncture wounds created by the pins if the individual suffers a blow to the chest while wearing a PFD or body armor. The ODU is not intended to be worn by Coast Guard units which engage in combat operations or are deployed overseas. These units continued to wear older woodland BDU and DCU uniforms before adopting the Navy Work Uniform for USCG units overseas or part of other DoD operations.

The Newcastle-under-Lyme Canal was a 3 mile 6 furlongs (6 km) level canal from the Trent & Mersey Canal at Stoke-on-Trent to Newcastle-under-Lyme. It was completed in 1800. The canal has been disused since 1935. Historical timeline 1795 - an Act of Parliament in granted permission for the making and maintaining a navigable Canal, from and out of the Navigation from the Trent to the Mersey, at or near Stoke-upon-Trent, in the county of Stafford, to the town of Newcastle-under-Lyme, in the said county. 1796 - a rival canal, Sir Nigel Gresley's Canal opened and had secured exclusive rights to supply Newcastle with coal for 21 years on condition that the price was no higher than 25 pence per ton. The agreement forbade the Newcastle-under-Lyme Canal from carrying any coal other than for use in the pottery trade. 1800 - the canal opened and because Gresley had exclusive rights to coal carrying, limestone became the main cargo on the Newcastle Under Lyme Canal. 1863 - the canal was sold to the North Staffordshire Railway. By this time the railway company also owned the Trent & Mersey Canal which the Newcastle Canal very much depended on. The canal's shareholders did very well out of the deal considering the route had only ever paid out occasional and very low dividends during their ownership. The railway company did not close down the Newcastle Canal and it continued in commercial use. 1921 - the northernmost part of the canal was closed. 1935 - the remaining part of the Newcastle Canal was closed and the whole waterway was abandoned. present - after its closure the canal was filled in, and today little evidence of the canal remains. The route The terminus of the Newcastle Canal was close to Brook Lane at an elevation of around 110m. A pub named the Boat & Horses still stands near the former basin though the basin itself was converted into railway sidings many years ago during the construction of the Stoke-on-Trent to Newcastle-under-Lyme train line, which began construction on 26 June 1846. Although still extant in 1971 these sidings have also now been removed. The canal headed southeast on the west side of London Road (A34). Where Occupation Street leaves London Road is the spot that would have been the bottom of the inclined plane providing a link to the Newcastle-under-Lyme Junction Canal, which was never built. Near here is the newly developed Lyme Valley Parkway, a recreational park built on a former rubbish tip. To the west of the canal line there is a small stream, Lyme Brook. A little further south there is a small Jewish synagogue/cemetery and a bowling green. The canal ran behind these into a cutting surrounded by a small wood. Past here it emerges by the side of the busy A34 opposite the General Hospital and the newly built University Hospital of North Staffordshire. Surprisingly this section has survived and today it is the only part of any of the canal that holds water. A couple of minor roads crossed the canal as it ran south close to the A34. At Oak Hill the canal curved southwest for a hundred yards or so and then curved back round to head east under the A34. The crossing point on the main road was about halfway between the B5041 (heading north east towards Stoke) and the A34/A500 Hanford roundabout. At Oak Hill the dry bed of the canal can be found behind The Cottage pub. Roughly following the B5041, the canal continued east until it reached the now minor road but former A5006 which runs north east from the afore mentioned roundabout. When the canal reached the old A5006 it turned again and headed northeast into Boothen. The route pulled away from the A5006 until it came close to the B5041. In Boothen the line of the canal can still be seen where it is grassed over alongside this London Road. Just before the B5041 and the former canal line met the A52 in Stoke the canal disappeared into a relatively short tunnel. On the far side of the tunnel is Spode factory and museum, shortly after this the Newcastle Canal ran into the Trent & Mersey Canal near Glebe Street. Until the early 1970s there was a 100 yard stretch of navigable Newcastle-under-Lyme Canal here which was used as moorings for Stoke Boat Club, this stretch was wiped out when the A500 by-pass was built. The one remaining item of the canal which can still be seen in Stoke is the site of a bridge in Corporation Street where both parapets have survived near the junction with London Road (B5041).

Biography  =Early life= Falkenhausen was born in Guben. His parents were the Prussian Lieutenant-General D. Alexander von Falkenhausen (1821‚Äì1889) and his wife Catherine n√©e Rouanet (1825‚Äì1907). Falkenhausen first attended a private school in Berlin and then, from May 1856, was a Cadet in Potsdam. In 1859 he moved to the main military academy in Berlin. In May 1862 he was attached to the 1st Foot Guards. Later, he was regimental adjutant of the combined Guards Reserve Infantry Regiment. He also took part in an 1866 campaign with the main army. Between October 1868 and May 1869, he served with the Guards Field Artillery as regimental adjutant. In the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì71) he participated in the battles of Gravelotte-St.Privat, Beaumont and Sedan and at the Siege of Paris. At the end of 1870, he was released from the position as regimental adjutant, from July 1871 he served as adjutant of the 28th Division in Karlsruhe. In subsequent years, he was transferred several times: from the 40th Fusiliers to the Army General Staff, then to the General Staff of the 16th Division in Trier and the General Staff of the VIII Army Corps (Koblenz). In 1885 he was transferred as commander of the First Battalion (Cologne) in the 65th Infantry. In March 1887 Falkenhausen was Chief of Staff of the Guards Corps (Berlin). In June 1890 he commanded the Queen Augusta Garde-Grenadier Regiment Nr 4 (Koblenz). Two years later he led the 29th Infantry Brigade (Cologne) and 1893 was chief quartermaster of the Chief of General Staff of the Army. Between 1893 and 1895, he was also a member of the Study Commission of the Military Academy. After working at the War Department, in January 1895 he became director of the General War Department in the Ministry of War. In February 1895 he was appointed representative in the Bundesrat. In January 1897 he became commander of the 2nd Guards Infantry Division (Berlin) in 1899 and commanding general of the XIII (Royal W√ºrttemberg) Corps. In March 1902 he retired, but kept busy with military science studies. =World War I= Falkenhausen's grave at Invalidenfriedhof, Berlin Upon mobilization in August 1914, Falkenhausen became commanding general of the Ersatz Corps of the 6th Army. As commander of Armee-Abteilung Falkenhausen he commanded the German troops during the battles for the 1914/15 Delmer back and in the trench warfare in Lorraine (1915-1916). He was highly successful during the first half of World War I and was awarded the Pour le M√©rite on 23 August 1915, with oak leaves following on 15 April 1916.Pour Le M√©rite website After having commanded the coastal defenses near Hamburg (April‚ÄìSeptember 1916), on 28 September 1916 Falkenhausen was given command of the 6th Army at the Battle of Arras in April 1917. He failed to deploy correctly the newly developed defence in depth to counter new British and Dominion tactics and was removed from field command by General Erich Ludendorff. Thereafter, he succeeded Moritz von Bissing and served as governor-general of the General Governorate of Belgium during the German occupation, from May 1917 until November 1918. In early 1918, The Times published an article ‚Äì entitled Falkenhausen's reign of terror ‚Äì describing 170 military executions of Belgian civilians that had taken place since he had been appointed governor.The Times, 6 January 1918, page 9 He died in G√∂rlitz. During the Second World War, his nephew Alexander von Falkenhausen served as military governor of Belgium (22 May 1940 - 15 July 1944).

Telephone calls are routed across a network of potentially many switching systems, often owned by different telephone carriers. Switching systems are connected with trunks. Each switch may have many neighbors. Neighboring switches owned by different operators are connected at interconnect points. The PSTN is a network that uses destination routing to direct calls from origin to the recipient. It is not a full mesh network with the nodes of every operator directly connected to those of every other, which would be impractical and inefficient. Therefore, calls may be routed through intermediate operator networks before they reach their final destination. Efficient least-cost routing is an important procedure in PSTN routing.  Call routing  Each time a call is placed for routing, the destination number (also known as the called party) is entered by the calling party into their terminal. The destination number generally has two parts, an area code which generally identifies the geographical location of the destination telephone, and a telephone number unique within that area code that determines the specific destination terminal. The telephone number may be subdivided into a prefix that may identify a more specific geographic location or a telephone exchange, and the rest of the number. For example, in the number (301) 555-1212, 301 is the area code and 555 is the prefix. (The area code is sometimes known as an \\"NPA,\\" and the area-code and prefix combination is known as an \\"NPA-NXX.\\") Sometimes if the call is between two terminals in the same local area (or, both terminals are on the same telephone exchange), then the area code may be omitted, but in other places, including the area code is required for the call to complete. When a call is received by an exchange, there are two treatments that may be applied: * Either the destination terminal is directly connected to that exchange, in which case the call is placed down that connection and the destination terminal rings. * Or the call must be placed to one of the neighboring exchanges through a connecting trunk for onward routing. Each exchange in the chain uses pre-computed routing tables to determine which connected exchange the onward call should be routed to. There may be several alternative routes to any given destination, and the exchange can select dynamically between these in the event of link failure or congestion. The routing tables are generated centrally based on the known topology of the network, the numbering plan, and analysis of traffic data. These are then downloaded to each exchange in the telephone operator's network. Because of the hierarchical nature of the numbering plan, and its geographical basis, most calls between telephone numbers on the same network can be routed based on their area code and prefix using these routing tables. Some calls however cannot be routed on the basis of prefix alone, for example non-geographic numbers, such as toll-free or freephone calling. In these cases the Intelligent Network is used to route the call instead of using the pre- computed routing tables. In determining routing plans, special attention is paid for example to ensure that two routes do not mutually overflow to each other, otherwise congestion will cause a destination to be completely blocked. According to Braess' paradox, the addition of a new, shorter, and lower cost route can lead to an increase in overall congestion.Wainwright M., A Small Road Network, Included in: Kennedy I., Teletraffic Lecture Notes, School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of the Witwatersrand, 2003.  Hybrid routing  Hybrid routing uses numbering plans and routing tables to permit the colocation, in the same area code, of switches using a deterministic routing scheme with switches using a non-deterministic routing scheme, such as flood search routing. Routing tables are constructed with no duplicate numbers, so that direct distance dialing service can be provided to all network subscribers. This may require the use of ten-digit telephone numbers.  Trunk reservation  When congestion causes many calls to use indirect alternative routes that pass through more exchanges than a direct route, the overall capacity of the network is reduced since each of these calls occupies several inter-exchange trunks. Trunk reservation reduces this effect by reserving a fraction of the capacity of each trunk for directly routed calls. Dynamic alternative routing Dynamic alternative routing (DAR) is a method of decentralized dynamic routing of telephone calls that uses only a limited amount of local information, which consists of trunk reservation thresholds, or simply knowing the collection of outgoing trunks from the exchange. An 1989 US patent by British Telecommunications describes dynamic alternative routing as: > A call between two nodes interconnected by a direct link is first offered to > the direct route, and if that is blocked it is offered to a currently > nominated two-link alternative route between the two nodes. If that route is > busy, the call is lost, and a randomly chosen two-link route is assigned to > be the new current nominated alternative route. Thus the chosen route varies to take changing traffic patterns and demands into account. The technique was the subject of Richard Gibbens' doctoral thesis at Cambridge University under Frank Kelly, in collaboration with BT Research, and a British patent was granted in 1985. DAR was implemented in British Telecom's national network in 1996.

MacArthur Boulevard (once called Conduit Road) is the main thoroughfare that passes through the Palisades. In 1893, this subdivision was laid out by the Palisades Improvement Company. The Palisades had the Great Falls Electric Railway that ran from 36th and Prospect streets out to Glen Echo. The International Athletic Park and Amusement Company secured a large block of the Palisades and constructed a Bicycle Track and General Amusement Park, which opened on Decoration Day in 1896.

History In June 1909, the Potomac Heights Land Co. (based in North Carolina) acquired previously known as the Athletic Park tract at the reported cost of $1000 an acre. The tract extends parallel with and between Conduit Road and the Potomac. It is divided by the Washington Railway and Electric Company, which ran from Georgetown to Glen Echo for a 5 cent fare. There were 800 lots at $450‚Äì$500 per lot and no home was to be erected at less than $2500. The Palisades is part of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 3D in Ward 3, the far northwest corner of the Northwest Quadrant just north of Georgetown. The current Palisades Citizens Association (PCA) was started as the Conduit Road Citizens Association in 1916. The old MacArthur Theater, now used as a CVS/pharmacy, in the Palisades The Palisades is one of the lesser- known neighborhoods in Washington, with a mixture of detached houses, townhouses and apartments. The homes along the bluff on Potomac Avenue offer a broad view of the Potomac River and the Virginia riverfront, with often impressive sunset views. Since 1928, the Palisades has been served by the Francis Scott Key Elementary School, which is part of the DC Public Schools. Extensive capital improvement of Key Elementary was completed in fall 2003. The renovated and expanded school currently enrolls 285 students and will gradually increase to approximately 300. Arizona Avenue Railway Bridge, part of the Capital Crescent Trail, crosses the C&O; Canal in the Palisades The current Palisades Neighborhood Library opened in 1964 and was renovated in 2018. Battery Kemble was at an elevation on Ridge Road (now Nebraska Avenue). The battery held two 100-pounder Parrott rifles, placed to sweep Chain Bridge and Virginia beyond. The site is located within Battery Kemble Park, bounded by Chain Bridge Road, MacArthur Boulevard, 49th Street, and Nebraska Avenue, NW. Fletcher's Cove is on the Potomac River and the C & O Canal National Historical Park, between Chain and Key Bridges. Fletcher's has been in this location since the 1850s and is renowned as a superb fishing and recreational area. The nearby Abner Cloud House is the oldest building on the canal, dating back to 1802. After 145 years of business, the fourth generation of Fletchers retired in 2004 and Guest Services Incorporated, a National Park Service concessionaire, assumed responsibility for the operation of the concessions. The area surrounding the boat house was then officially named Fletcher's Cove, though most people still call it Fletcher's Boat House. Other notable landmarks making the Palisades unique are the old Conduit Road Schoolhouse on MacArthur Boulevard, Palisades Community Church (1923), The Lab School of Washington (1967) (formerly the Florence Crittenton Home for Unwed Mothers), the German Embassy, St. David's Episcopal Church (1940), Sibley Hospital (1961) and Gen. Montgomery C. Meig's Washington Aqueduct/ Delcarlia Filtration/ Water Treatment Plant (1853). Remnants are everywhere of the old Capitol Transit #20 trolley (Union Station to Cabin John) that was a very popular ride thRough the Palisades out to the Glen Echo Amusement Park (1898‚Äì1968). In addition, the Georgetown Branch of the B & O railroad once worked its way through The Palisades, the most notable landmark being the steel trestle bridge over Arizona Ave. Since the Georgetown Branch's abandonment in 1985, it has been part of the Capital Crescent Trail. The Palisades Firehouse (Engine Company 29), at 4811 MacArthur Blvd. NW, built in 1925 is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was designed by architect Albert L. Harris in Colonial Revival style. Also National Register- listed are: *Conduit Road Schoolhouse *Dr. Franklin E. Kameny House, ordinary- looking home of gay rights leader *Northwest No. 4 Boundary Marker of the Original District of Columbia *Washington Aqueduct. Designed by John J. Zink, the MacArthur Theater, originally a single 1,000 seater that was tri-plexed in 1982, was in use from December 1946 through March 1997. On September 11, 1936, at a cost of $40,000, the Palisades Playground and field house was dedicated at its current Sherier and Edmunds Place location. The Palisades neighborhood is the home for a variety of popular restaurants such as Figs, Makoto, Bambu, Bistro Aracosia, BlackSalt, Chen's Gourmet, Seventh Hill Pizza, Kotobuki, DC Boathouse, Et Voila' and the new Salt and Pepper Restaurant, and its very own pet supply store, Profeed of DC. A high point of the year for many in the neighborhood is the annual July 4 parade, featuring local bands, fire engines and children on highly decorated tricycles and bicycles. Education District of Columbia Public Schools operates public schools. Mann Elementary School, Key Elementary School, Hardy Middle School, and Wilson High School serve Palisades. Private schools in Palisades include Our Lady of Victory Catholic School, the Lab School, the lower and middle divisions of Georgetown Day School, the River School, and St. Patrick's Episcopal Day School.

President Theodore Roosevelt's son Archibald, President Richard Nixon's daughter Tricia, President Bill Clinton's daughter Chelsea Clinton, President Barack Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, Vice President Joe Biden's grandchildren, and Vice President Al Gore's son, Albert Gore III, graduated from Sidwell Friends.  History  Thomas Sidwell started a \\"Friends' Select School\\" in 1883 on I Street in downtown Washington, four blocks from the White House. It opened with just eleven students. Beginning in 1911, Sidwell began buying property between Wisconsin Avenue and 37th St. Initially, the new property was used for athletic fields‚Äîand, with the central campus' downtown location‚Äîmeant students had to shuttle between the two sites by streetcar. However, in 1923, Sidwell built a building for school dances and other social gatherings on what came to be known as the Wisconsin Avenue campus. In 1925, the school added a kindergarten, making it the first K‚Äì12 school in Washington. In 1934, the name of the school was changed to \\"Sidwell Friends School\\", and began its gradual re-location to the Wisconsin Avenue building. By 1938, the transition to the new building had been completed, and the I Street property was sold. At the urging of the students, the school briefly adopted a dress code in 1955, which included a coat and tie for all male high school students. The dress code was later dropped‚Äîagain at the urging of students‚Äîin the 1970s. Previously all grade levels were in Washington, DC. In 1963 the elementary school moved to the former Longfellow School for Boys, purchased by Sidwell Friends. Sidwell became racially integrated in 1964. Before 1964 it was a white-only school. Since 2005, the Wisconsin Avenue campus has seen the completion of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) platinum Middle School; a new indoor athletic facility; underground parking garage; and two turf fields. A new Quaker Meeting House facility is located in the newly renovated Arts Center. Thomas B. Farquhar was removed from his position as the Head of School after the 2013‚Äì2014 school year. He became the Head of School after the retirement of former Head of School Bruce Stewart at the end of the 2008‚Äì2009 school year.Sidwell Head of School Search Committee Report Bryan K. Garman, the current Head of School, took office beginning with the 2014‚Äì2015 school year. In April 2020, the school received $5.2 million in federally backed small business loans as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. The school received scrutiny over this loan, which meant to protect small and private businesses. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin tweeted that the schools should return the money, but the school stated they were keeping it, despite having a $53 million endowment. the school plans to move elementary grades back to the District of Columbia, as it purchased the former Washington Home in 2017 for campus expansion purposes.  Academics  In 2005, Sidwell's AP English Exam scores were the highest in the nation for all medium-sized schools (300‚Äì799 students in grades 10‚Äì12) offering the AP English exam.College Board: Advanced Placement: Report to the Nation Sidwell does not offer an AP English course. All students must acquire at least 20 credits before graduating. Students are required to take four years of English, three years of mathematics, three years of history, two years of one foreign language, two years of science, and two years of art. In addition to this, all freshmen must take a full year Ninth Grade Studies course that involves a service project. Tenth and eleventh graders must also take courses corresponding to their grade level.Sidwell Friends School: Graduation Requirements Sidwell is a member school of School Year Abroad.  Student safety  In 2016, the school revised its policy on sexual misconduct after reports that a teen had been raped by her ex-boyfriend on the school's campus. No charges were filed against the teen, and the school installed more security cameras to deter future assaults. Despite the measures, a year later another student reported sexual assault on the campus grounds. A teenage girl was coerced into vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Former Sidwell psychologist and sex ed teacher James Huntington was the target of a 2013 lawsuit for his affair with the parent of a student he was counseling. The case exposed teachers that hit on students.  Athletics  Sidwell's athletic teams are known as the Quakers; their colors are maroon and gray. The Quakers compete in the Mid-Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAC) for boys' sports (after previously competing in the Interstate Athletic Conference (IAC) until 1999) and the Independent School League (ISL) for girls' sports.

The most famous kuromaku, or behind-the-scenes power broker, of the 20th century, he was active in Japan's political arena and criminal underworld from the 1950s to the early 1970s. Early life Born in Nihonmatsu, Japan, Kodama lived with relatives in Japanese-occupied Korea early in his life, and during that time formed an ultranationalist group with the intent to assassinate various Japanese politicians. He was caught in 1932 and served a prison term of three and a half years. Sino-Japanese War After his release from prison, the Japanese government contracted Kodama to help move supplies for the Japanese war effort out of continental Asia and into Japan. He accomplished this through a network of allies he made during his time working in Korea as a youth. Kodama became involved in the drug trade at this time, moving opiates to Japan along with the supplies he was paid by the government to smuggle. He formed a vast network of allies and built a fortunemore than $175 million U.S. making him one of the richest men in Asia during this time. Post-war At the end of World War II, Kodama was arrested by the United States as a suspected Class A war criminal. He was held in Sugamo Prison with Ryoichi Sasakawa, where the two formed a long friendship. While imprisoned, he wrote Sugamo Diary (a chronicle of his experience in prison) and I Was Defeated (an autobiographical work). Post-war political efforts In 1948, the U.S. intelligence community later secured his release in exchange for his aid in fighting communism in Asia. Kodama, being a right- wing ultranationalist, eagerly obliged, using his fortune and network of contacts to quell labor disputes, root out Communist sympathizers and otherwise fight socialist activities in Japan. In 1949, the CIA paid him to smuggle a shipment of tungsten out of China. The shipment never arrived but Kodama kept his money. Organized crime Kodama used his power in the yakuza to suppress anything he deemed the least bit communist or anti-nationalist. In 1947 he ordered the Meiraki-gumi, an affiliated gang, to break up a labour movement at the Hokutan coal mine. He also offered his support to the anti- communist right-wing Liberal Democratic Party. During this period, Kodama used his underworld connections to help unite the various gangs, which had greatly proliferated in the years immediately following World War II. The short-lived Kanto-kai was the most prominent example of these efforts. He also brokered a truce between the Yamaguchi-gumi and the Tosei-kai, headed by his colleague Hisayuki Machii. Kodama was also involved in a number of scandals in the post- war era, many of which involved United States businesses and the CIA. Most notable of these was the Lockheed L-1011 sales scandal in the 1970s, which effectively marked the end of his career.

There may also be by- elections. Electoral systems include first-past-the-post, proportional representation, single non-transferable voting, and a parallel mixture of the above. General elections are held to elect the president and vice president jointly, and the 113 members of the Legislative Yuan. Local elections are held to elect magistrates of counties, mayors of special municipalities, cities, townships and county-administered cities, chief administrators of indigenous districts and village chiefs. Legislative Yuan and local elections are regional; citizens vote based on their registered address. Elections are supervised by the Central Election Commission (CEC), an independent agency under the central government, with the municipality, county and city election commissions under its jurisdiction. The minimum voting age is twenty years. Voters must satisfy a four-month residency requirement before being allowed to cast a ballot. History Elections were held for the first time in Taiwan by the Japanese colonial government on 22 November 1935, electing half of the city and township councillors. The other half were appointed by the prefectural governors. Only men aged 25 and above and who had paid a tax of five yen or more a year were allowed to vote, which was only 28,000 out of the 4 million population. The elections were held again in 1939, but the 1943 election was cancelled due to the Second World War. The government of the Republic of China, led by the Kuomintang, retreated to Taiwan Island in 1949 after losing the Chinese Civil War with the Communist Party of China. At that time, the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion was enforced and largely restricted civil and political rights including voting right of the Taiwanese people. In addition, the Martial law in Taiwan also prohibited most forms of opposition. In the eight elections starting from the 1948 Republic of China presidential election in Nanking (later known as Nanjing) to the 1990 Taiwan presidential election, the President was selected by the National Assembly first elected in 1947 and which had never been reelected since. The Legislative Yuan also had not been reelected since 1948. The provincial Governor and municipal Mayors were appointed by the central government. Direct elections were only held for local governments at the county level, and for legislators at the provincial level. From the 1990s, a series of democratic reforms were implemented in Taiwan. The Additional Articles of the Constitution were adopted to grant full civil and political rights to the Taiwanese people (officially the people of the Free area of the Republic of China). Under the Additional Articles, the President and the national legislators are to be elected directly. The first congressional elections on Taiwan were held in 1991 for National Assembly and 1992 for Legislative Yuan. The first election for provincial Governors and municipality Mayors was in 1994. Most importantly, Taiwan held the first direct election of the President and Vice President in 1996. The provincial government was reconstructed as a subsidiary of the central government in 1998 and elections for governor and provincial legislators were terminated. The National Assembly ceased to be convened regularly in 2000 and was abolished in 2005. The number of members of the Legislative Yuan was reduced to 113 from 2008. In recent years, the government is further working on synchronizing the date of the elections into two key dates: national elections and local elections. * The national elections elect the President and Vice President as well as the 113 Legislators. * The local elections elect 11,130 local officials who serve in self-government bodies. Current types elections =Presidential elections= Presidential elections are held to jointly elect the president and vice president by first-past-the-post. =Legislative Yuan elections= Legislative elections are held to elect the 113 members of the Legislative Yuan by parallel voting: * 73 members by first-past-the-post in single-member constituencies * 6 by single non-transferable voting in multi- member constituencies, exclusive for persons with indigenous status * 34 by party-list proportional representation voting =Local elections= Local elections are held to elect: * Mayors of special municipalities * Magistrates of counties and mayors of cities * Councillors in special municipality councils * Councillors in county and city councils * Mayors of townships/cities * Representatives in township/city councils * Chief administrators of mountain indigenous districts * Representatives in mountain indigenous district councils * Village chiefs This is the official classification, hence local elections are also known as nine-in-one elections. A resident of a county or indigenous district is eligible for five types of votes, whereas a resident of a city or non-indigenous district of a special municipality is eligible for three. Magistrates, mayors, chief administrators, and village chiefs are elected by first-past-the-post. Councillors and council representatives are elected by single non-transferable voting in multi-member constituencies. Eligibility In order to vote in Taiwan, one must be a national with household registration of the Republic of China who will be 20 years or older on the day before the election. For presidential elections, the voter must have once lived in the Taiwan area for six consecutive months or longer. Residents of the area at the time of the election are automatically registered while those living abroad must apply. For legislative and local elections, the voter must have been living in the associated electoral district for four consecutive months or longer at the time of the election. For legislative elections, the electoral district for indigenous and party- list votes is nationwide. Eligibility for the three types of votes is evaluated separately.

Land Warrior was a United States Army program, cancelled in 2007 U.S. Army Budget Request Documents FY2008 (page 4)Stryker Brigade News ‚Äì Land Warrior funds cut but restarted in 2008,http://www.army- technology.com/projects/land_warrior/ Land Warrior at Army-Technology.com that used a combination of commercial, off-the-shelf technology (COTS) and current- issue military gear and equipment designed to: * integrate small arms with high-tech equipment; * provide communications and command and control at the infantry soldier level; * look at the individual infantry soldier as a complete unit rather than as a segment of a larger force. While technology had long been a primary focus of the U.S. Armed Forces, very little of it had actually been adopted by the U.S. Army infantry soldier. With growing concerns of urban warfare and dismounted infantry actions, the U.S. Army recognized the need to upgrade an individual infantryman. The Land Warrior program drew upon many wearable computer concepts, and maximized existing technologies to correct most infantry soldier limitations in the short term. The SI (Stryker Interoperable) version of the system completed U.S. Army testing as of November 2004. Due to limited resources, and issues with the overall weight of the system, Land Warrior was cancelled by the Army in February 2007, but restarted in July 2007. Despite the initial system's cancellation the 4th Stryker Brigade Combat Team (SBCT) was deployed to Iraq as part of the spring 2007 \\"surge\\" of U.S. forces, and used the Land Warrior, on which they had trained for the previous few years. The systems and technology of the Land Warrior program were to be rolled into the Future Force Warrior program, and the Army has developed the Nett Warrior system to supersede Land Warrior as its next soldier network program. Internationally, there are several similar development programs, these include IdZ (Germany), FIST (UK), F√©lin (France), Land 125 (Australia), MARKUS (Sweden), Soldato Futuro (Italy), IMESS (Switzerland), Projekt TYTAN (Poland), FINSAS (India) and ACMS (Singapore), Ratnik (Russia), SARV (Iran).  History  A U.S. Army soldier displays the 21st Century, Land Warrior, Integrated Fighting System at Fort McPherson, Georgia in June 2001. The system consists of a global positioning system, within a computer/radio subsystem. The original Land Warrior program, by other name, was undertaken by General Electric in Moorestown, New Jersey approximately 1989, as a prototype having intent to eventually reduce size and weight in future phases. Then in the mid-1990s, the name Land Warrior was initially handled by a division of Hughes Aerospace, which was subsequently acquired by Raytheon. (The soldier radio component of Land Warrior was to be supplied by the Integrated Information Systems division of Motorola.Initial tests with soldiers were conducted in 1995‚Äì96 in Fort Lewis with 1st Bn, 9th Infantry Regiment (light) using both squad-level information systems and Humvee mounted systems. Early iterations (prototypes) of TWS (Thermal Weapons Sights) and integrated GPS systems were also in use with some initial, albeit limited, success. In 2001, Motorola's Integrated Information Systems division, headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona, was acquired by General Dynamics and was renamed General Dynamics Decision Systems (GDDS) . This division, now part of GDC4S, is the holder of the current Land Warrior ‚Äì Stryker Interoperable contract.) Early demonstration versions of the LW system used software written in the Ada programming language running on a Unix platform. In January 1999, in an attempt to reduce development costs and accelerate the program, the development work was transitioned to a multi-company team that had been organized by Exponent (NASDAQ: EXPO), an engineering firm with headquarters in Silicon Valley. An intensive redesign of the system ensued, and both the embedded firmware and the application software were rewritten from scratch. Many of the COTS hardware components were purchased (literally \\"off the shelf\\") at Fry's Electronics, the Silicon Valley retail chain. Approximately 100 proof-of-concept Land Warrior units were built and successfully demonstrated in September 2000 by a U.S. Army platoon that was air-dropped into a large war-fighting exercise at Fort Polk, Louisiana. These initial prototype units, designated Land Warrior v0.6, were built around a PC/104 computer platform running Microsoft Windows. The system used the CAN-bus protocol on the wired PAN (personal area network). The communications subsystem was built using Windows CE running on a StrongARM platform, and the wireless network protocol was IEEE 802.11. During the Fort Polk exercise, preliminary interoperability with traditional military radio networks was also demonstrated for LW v0.6, using a two-way, SINCGARS-compatible gateway radio. The success of the Fort Polk exercise reinvigorated the program, and further funding was allocated for the next phase of LW development. A \\"Land Warrior Consortium\\" was formed by several of the contracting firms, with the goal of designing and building the first field-able LW system, designated LW v1.0, later LW-IC (Land Warrior ‚Äì Initial Capability). The basic Windows and WinCE platforms were retained, and a new hybrid PAN was designed, which drew upon both USB and FireWire protocols. A modified version of the IEEE 802.11 protocol was adopted, which added various enhancements for COMSEC and information security, mobile ad hoc network (MANET) capabilities, and support for multi-hop packet routing. In 2003, a variant of the LW-IC system was developed to incorporate features of the CombatID System (CIDS) ‚Äì a form of IFF (identification friend or foe) that is designed to reduce the potential for friendly fire incidents. This version, designated LW-CIDS, was successfully demonstrated in interoperational tests with several other CIDS- equipped units at Moffett Field, California. 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry in Iraq in July 2007. As the Land Warrior program matured, it became clear that its successful deployment would hinge significantly upon the key factor of batteries. The need to continuously resupply (or recharge) LW batteries was proving to be a major logistical challenge. This was one of the driving factors behind the decision to move away from an earlier plan to initially equip airborne Army units, as in the Fort Polk exercise, and to focus instead upon those using Stryker ground vehicle systems. This latter approach would enable more LW batteries to be distributed and/or recharged as needed. The contract for development of the Land Warrior ‚Äì Stryker Interoperable (LW-SI) version of the system was awarded in 2003 to an industry team that was led by General Dynamics and included most of the existing Land Warrior Consortium companies. At about the same time, further development of the existing LW-IC system was halted and the manufacturing plans for it were shelved indefinitely. The Land Warrior Consortium was formally disbanded and work got under way on the newly focused LW-SI program. In September 2006, the 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment trained with and evaluated the LW-SI system.Erwin, Sandra. \\"'Land Warriors' Link Up With Stryker Vehicles\\" , National Defense Magazine, May 2006.\\"Army assess new Land Warrior System\\" , Army News Service, 22 June 2006. The system successfully completed the assessment, which was based on Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) guidance, and received testimonials from the unit. However, funding for further system development under the Land Warrior program was suspended in February 2007, although the 4‚Äì9 Infantry was deployed to Iraq and used the LW-SI system extensively. The Land Warrior program was then re- instated. This was the final trial phase before the key decision is made on the overall future of wearable soldier systems, including Future Force Warrior. The decision was made in 2011 to continue the program. Description Land Warrior has three priority objectives: * Improving the lethality of an individual soldier * Increasing the survivability of a soldier * Providing full command, communications, and control to a soldier Land Warrior has seven main subsystems: * Weapon * Integrated helmet assembly * Protective clothing and equipment * Computer * Navigation * Radio * Software system Later features of the Land Warrior system included: * providing dismounted soldier combat identification for en route situational awareness and power recharge to reduce 'friendly fire' incidents * Commander's Digital Assistant leader planning tool * weight and power reduction * scalability and tailorability for operational missions = Weapon = A U.S. Army soldier showcases Land Warrior at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, D.C. in June 2007. The original system was built around the M16 rifle or M4 carbine, both with modular rail mounts to allow customization as needed for each mission. It included the weapon itself, plus components such as a daylight video sight, thermal weapons sight and MFL (Multi-Function Laser). The MFL provided range and direction information, as well as IR, visible, and MILES lasers, while the cameras provided a video feed and thermographic capabilities, plus allowing a soldier to shoot around corners or behind cover without actually exposing himself to enemy fire. This is highly effective for confirming kills without exposing one's position. = Helmet = The Helmet Subsystem (HSS) combined a lightweight advanced helmet with a computer and OLED display that provided various information from digital maps and troop locations down to his weapon-mounted video camera. This is what would have allowed the soldier to see (and fire) around corners. The HSS also incorporated a microphone as well as a headset. = Armor and protection = The Interceptor Body Armor system and Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment (MOLLE) load-bearing system currently in service with the U.S. Army today are partially a result of the Land Warrior program. = Computer = The Computer Subsystem (CSS) provided the processing power and storage capacity for the system. The CSS is based around an ARM core processor. Prior to the project's cancellation (when project funds were moved to Hurricane Katrina relief) the computer used was Techsol's Ethernet Audio Interface board,http://techsol.ca/TechsolEthernetAudioProductSpec.pdf powered by an s3c2410a processor from Samsung Semiconductor, featuring an ARM-920T core running at up to 200 MHz. The board included a low-power Ethernet interface using the cs8900a from Cirrus Logic, an audio interface using the internal IIS audio interface of the Samsung chip connected to an AKM integrated Audio Codec and Amplifier, a GPS receiver from Motorola, and using GPIOs for the push- buttons used for Volume UP/DOWN, and also Channel UP/DOWN. With a wide- voltage-range input power-supply, the entire wearable computer board was 2/3 the size of a business card (see photo). Techsol's \\"Ethernet Audio Interface\\" Computer board, with GPS Future versions were powered by an XScale processor from Intel. The CSS connects to each one of the LRUs as well as to the batteries. = Navigation = The Navigation Subsystem (NSS) provided positional information, it integrates a GPS receiver and a Dead Reckoning Module (DRM) that maintains accurate location when GPS signal becomes unavailable. = Radio = The Communication Network Radio Subsystem (CNRS) provided communications capabilities for the Land Warrior. The CNRS is based on EPLRS. = Software = Land Warrior's software system was powered by a variant of the Linux operating system and has a modular, open architecture for further improvement. Reliability in recent testing at Fort Benning has been extremely high. The Land Warrior software suite contains six main software packages for weapon sights and for data.  Stryker Interoperable Vehicle Kit  A key capability of the Land Warrior development effort was the interoperability with the Stryker family of combat vehicles, attained through a Stryker Vehicle Integration Kit or VIK. Land Warriors mounted in the Stryker vehicle were to be provided voice, data and power connectivity through an umbilical connection, as an extension of the individual soldier's Personal Area Network. The mounted Land Warriors were to have the capability of communicating voice and data with each other, the vehicle crew, Land Warriors external to the vehicle and other Land Warrior units mounted in other Stryker vehicles. Communications with the vehicle crew were to be achieved by interfacing to the Vehicle Intercom System. Dismounted Land Warriors, when within communications range of their Stryker vehicle, were to have the same voice connectivity and Army Battle Command System interoperability as the mounted Land Warrior. The Vehicle Integration Kit (VIK) was being developed in a spiral fashion to help manage development risk. The first spiral produced early VIK prototypes used to validate physical integration approaches in the various vehicle configurations. It also demonstrated Land Warrior soldier voice connectivity with the Stryker crew-members in and around the vehicle through the Vehicle Intercom System. There were plans to integrate the Boomerang Mobile Shooter Detection System onto the Stryker vehicle as part of the Land Warrior system.http://www.deagel.com/news/Boomerang-Sniper-Detection- System-to-Be-Integrated-into-US-Army-Land-Warrior_n000002839.aspx Program outcome Land Warrior was the first U.S. Army soldier network system to be used in combat since the networked soldier concept began in 1989. 229 Land Warrior ensembles were deployed by the 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment to Iraq from May 2007 to June 2008. A Stryker Brigade later deployed with the system to Afghanistan, and Land Warrior remained in use until spring 2012. The Army built upon Land Warrior with the Ground Soldier System (GSS) as its successor, an advanced dismounted soldier integrated situational awareness system that entered technology development in February 2009. GSS Increment 1 was renamed Nett Warrior in June 2010 after Medal of Honor recipient Robert B. Nett (although the term \\"Nett\\" has frequently been misinterpreted as a reflection of its tactical networking features). Nett Warrior was first demonstrated in spring 2011, which then was essentially the 10-pound Land Warrior ensemble with some enhanced additional software. Later iterations focused on a hand-held solution that integrated a commercial hand-held screen device with the Rifleman radio, simplifying the system and decreasing weight to . Nett Warrior utilizes enhanced smartphones, using different models over the course of its development including the Motorola Atrix, Samsung Galaxy Note I, and the Samsung Galaxy Note 2.The Rise of the Soldier System ‚Äì Defensemedianetwork.com, 25 June 2013  See also  *Air Warrior *Future Force Warrior *Cognitive Technology Threat Warning System (CT2WS) *Micropower *MOLLE *Interceptor Body Armor *M4 carbine *Nett Warrior, The United States' integrated situational awareness system *Future Soldier, the multi-national Future Soldier project. *Future Force Warrior, the United States Future Soldier program. *IdZ, the German Bundeswehr Future Soldier project. *IMESS, the Swiss Future Soldier program. *FIST, the British analog to the Future Force Warrior program. *F√âLIN, the French Future Soldier program. *21st Century soldier, the Czech Future Soldier project. *F-INSAS, the Indian Futuristic soldier program. *Projekt TYTAN, the Polish Future Soldier Program. *ACMS, the Singaporean Future Soldier project. *Ratnik (–†–∞—Ç–Ω–∏–∫), Russia. *Modernized Infantry Battalion Bangladesh References 9\\\\.

The Parthian general Surena decisively defeated a Roman invasion force under the command of Marcus Licinius Crassus, who died at the battle. It is commonly seen as one of the earliest and most important battles between the Roman and Parthian Empires and one of the most crushing defeats in Roman history. According to the poet Ovid in Book 6 of his poem Fasti, the battle occurred on the 9th day of June. Crassus, a member of the First Triumvirate and the wealthiest man in Rome, had been enticed by the prospect of military glory and riches and decided to invade Parthia without the official consent of the Senate. Rejecting an offer from the Armenian King Artavasdes II to allow Crassus to invade Parthia via Armenia, Crassus marched his army directly through the deserts of Mesopotamia. His forces clashed with Surena's troops near Carrhae. Surena's cavalry killed or captured most of the Roman soldiers. Crassus himself was killed when truce negotiations turned violent. His death ended the First Triumvirate. The following four-year period of peace between the remaining two members of the Triumvirate, Julius Caesar and Pompey, argues against the view that Crassus had been a peacekeeper within the group and supports the views of most Roman historians that friction between Crassus and Pompey had always been a greater cause of tension than that between Caesar and Pompey. Background = Triumvirate = The war in Parthia resulted from political arrangements intended to be mutually beneficial for Marcus Licinius Crassus, Pompeius Magnus, and Julius Caesar, the so-called First Triumvirate. In March and April 56 BC, meetings were held at Ravenna and Luca, in Caesar's province of Cisalpine Gaul, to reaffirm the weakening alliance formed four years earlier. It was agreed that the Triumvirate would marshal its supporters and resources to secure legislation for prolonging Caesar's Gallic command and to influence the upcoming elections for 55 BC, with the objective of a second joint consulship for Crassus and Pompeius.Both Pompeius and Crassus had held their first consulship in 70 BC, fifteen years earlier. The Triumvirate aimed to expand their faction's power by traditional means: military commands, placing political allies in office and advancing legislation to promote their interests. Pressure in various forms was brought to bear on the elections: money, influence from patronage and friendship and the force of 1000 troopers brought from Gaul by Crassus's son Publius. The faction secured the consulship and most of the other offices that were sought. Legislation passed by the tribune Trebonius (the Lex Trebonia) granted extended proconsulships of five years, matching that of Caesar in Gaul, to the two outgoing consuls. The Spanish provinces would go to Pompeius. Crassus arranged to have Syria with the transparent intention of going to war with Parthia.This political overview primarily derives from Erich S. Gruen, \\"Pompey, the Roman Aristocracy, and the Conference of Luca,\\" Historia 18 (1969) 71‚Äì108, especially 107‚Äì08. The literature on the triumvirate's political deal-making in 56 BC is vast.

Cadoux, \\"Marcus Crassus: A Revaluation,\\" Greece & Rome 3 (1956) 153‚Äì61. = Developments in Parthia = Meanwhile in Parthia, a war of succession had broken out in 57 BC after King Phraates III had been killed by his sons Orodes II and Mithridates IV, who then began fighting each other over the throne. In the first stage, Orodes emerged victorious and appointed his brother as king of Media (his de facto governor) as a compromise. However, another armed clash made Orodes force Mithridates to flee to Aulus Gabinius, the Roman proconsul of Syria. Gabinius sought to interfere in the succession dispute on behalf of Mithridates so that Rome could make him its puppet king and seize control of Parthia in the process. However, Gabinius abandoned his plans and opted to intervene in Ptolemaic Egyptian affairs instead. Mithridates proceeded to invade Babylonia on his own with some initial success but was soon confronted by the army of the Parthian commander Surena. Gabinius's successor, Crassus, also sought to ally himself with Mithridates and invaded Parthia's client-state Osroene in 54 BC but wasted most of his time in waiting for reinforcements on the Balikh River's left bank while Surena besieged, defeated and executed Mithridates in Seleucia on the Tigris. Orodes, now unopposed in his own realm, marched north to invade Rome's ally Armenia, where King Artavasdes II soon defected to the Parthian side. = Crassus's preparations = Marcus Licinius Crassus The notoriously-wealthy Marcus Crassus was around 62 when he embarked on the Parthian invasion. Greed is often regarded by the ancient sources, particularly his biographer Plutarch, as his major character fault and his motive for going to war.Plutarch, Crassus 2 on greed, 14.4 on greed and envy, 16 on Crassus's eagerness for the Parthian campaign; see Bill Thayer's edition of the Loeb Classical Library translation at LacusCurtius online. The historian Erich S. Gruen believed that Crassus's purpose was to enrich the public treasury since personal wealth was not what Crassus most lacked.Erich S. Gruen, \\"M. Licinius Crassus: A Review Article,\\" American Journal of Ancient History 2 (1977), p. 125. Most modern historians tend to view insatiable greed, envy of Pompey's military exploits and rivalry as his motivations since his long-faded military reputation had always been inferior to that of Pompeius and, after five years of war in Gaul, to that of Caesar. His major military achievements had been the defeat of Spartacus in 71 BC and his victory at the Battle of the Colline Gate for Sulla a decade earlier.RedRampant ‚Äì The Battle of Carrhae , Retrieved 10 May 2007 Plutarch noted that Caesar wrote to Crassus from Gaul and endorsed the plan to invade Parthia, an indication that he regarded Crassus's military campaign as complementary and not merely rivalrous to his own.Plutarch, Crassus 16.3. Another factor in Crassus's decision to invade Parthia was the expected ease of the campaign. The Roman legions had easily crushed the numerically superior armies of other eastern powers such as Pontus and Armenia, and Crassus expected Parthia to be an easy target.Plutarch, Crassus 18.4. Cicero, however, suggested an additional factor: the ambitions of the talented Publius Crassus, who had commanded successful campaigns in Gaul under Caesar. Upon his return to Rome as a highly decorated officer, Publius took steps to establish his own political career. Roman sources view the Battle of Carrhae not only as a calamity for Rome and a disgrace for Marcus Crassus but also as a tragedy that cut short Publius Crassus's promising career.Rawson, \\"Crassorum funera,\\" pp. 540‚Äì49. See also Ronald Syme, \\"The Sons of Crassus,\\" Latomus 39 (1980) 403‚Äì08, and article on Publius Licinius Crassus (son of triumvir). Some Romans objected to the war against Parthia. Cicero calls it a war nulla causa (\\"with no justification\\") on the grounds that Parthia had a treaty with Rome.Cicero, De finibus 3.75. The tribune Ateius Capito put up strenuous opposition and infamously conducted a public ritual of execration as Crassus prepared to depart.F.E. Adcock, \\"The Legal Term of Caesar's Governorship in Gaul,\\" Classical Quarterly 26 (1932), pp. 23‚Äì24; on omens and curses, see article Gaius Ateius Capito (tribune). Despite protests and dire omens, Marcus Crassus left Rome on November 14, 55 BC.Date based on Cicero, Ad Atticum 4.13.2. Publius Crassus joined him in Syria during the winter of 54‚Äì53 BC and brought with him the thousand Celtic cavalry troopers from Gaul who remained loyal to their young leader until their death. Invasion of Parthia Extent of the Parthian Empire Crassus arrived in Syria in late 55 BC and immediately set about using his immense wealth to raise an army. He assembled a force of seven legions for a total of about 28,000 to 35,000 heavy infantry. He also had about 4,000 light infantry, and 4,000 cavalry, including the 1000-strong Gallic cavalry that Publius had brought with him.Plutarch. Life of Crassus, 20.1 With the aid of Hellenic settlements in Syria and the support of about 6,000 cavalry from Artavasdes, the Armenia king, Crassus marched on Parthia. Artavasdes advised him to take a route through Armenia to avoid the desert and offered him reinforcements of a further 10,000 cavalry and 30,000 infantry.Plutarch, Life of Crassus, 19.1. Crassus refused the offer and decided to take the direct route through Mesopotamia and to capture the great cities in the region. In response, the Parthian king, , divided his army and took most of the soldiers, mainly foot archers with a small amount of cavalry, to punish the Armenians himself. He sent the rest of his forces, 9,000 horse archers and 1,000 cataphracts under the command of spahbod Surena, to scout out and harass Crassus's army. Orodes did not anticipate that Surena's force, outnumbered by almost five to one, would be able to defeat Crassus and merely wanted to delay him. Crassus received directions from the Osroene chieftain Ariamnes, who had assisted Pompey in his eastern campaigns.Plutarch. Life of Crassus, 21.2 Crassus trusted Ariamnes, who, however, was in the pay of the Parthians. He urged Crassus to attack at once and falsely stated that the Parthians were weak and disorganized. He then led Crassus's army into the most desolate part of the desert, far from any water. Crassus then received a message from Artavasdes that claimed that the main Parthian army was in Armenia, and the letter begged him for help. Crassus ignored the message and continued his advance into Mesopotamia.Plutarch. Life of Crassus, 22.3 He encountered Surena's army near the town of Carrhae.  Battle  Formations at the start of the battle After being informed of the presence of the Parthian army, Crassus's army panicked. Cassius recommended for the army to be deployed in the traditional Roman fashion, with infantry forming the centre and cavalry on the wings. At first, Crassus agreed, but he soon changed his mind and redeployed his men into a hollow square, each side formed by twelve cohorts.Plutarch. Life of Crassus, 23.3 That formation would protect his forces from being outflanked but at the cost of mobility. The Roman forces advanced and came to a stream. Crassus's generals advised him to make camp and to attack the next morning to give his men a chance to rest. Publius, however, was eager to fight and managed to convince Crassus to confront the Parthians immediately.Plutarch. Life of Crassus, 23.5. kontos The Parthians went to great lengths to intimidate the Romans. Firstly, they beat a great number of hollow drums and the Roman troops were unsettled by the loud and cacophonous noise. Surena then ordered his cataphracts to cover their armour in cloths and advance. When they were within sight of the Romans, they simultaneously dropped the cloths and revealed their shining armour. The sight was designed to intimidate the Romans.Plutarch. Life of Crassus, 24.3. Though he had originally planned to shatter the Roman lines with a charge by his cataphracts, he judged that it would not yet be enough to break them. Thus, he sent his horse archers to surround the Roman square. Crassus sent his skirmishers to drive the horse archers off, but they were driven back by the latter's arrows. The horse archers then engaged the legionaries. The legionaries were protected by their large shields (scuta) and armour (re- enactment with composite bows does not answer the question whether arrows can penetrate mail), but they could not cover the entire body. Some historians describe the arrows partially penetrating the Roman shields and nailing the shields to the limbs of the Roman infantry and nailing their feet to the ground. However, Plutarch wrote in his accounts that the Romans were met with a shower of arrows that passed through every kind of cover, hard and soft alike. Other historians state that most wounds inflicted were nonfatal hits to exposed limbs.Goldsworthy, Adrian. The Roman Army at War 100 BC‚Äì200 AD. The Romans repeatedly advanced towards the Parthians to attempt to engage in close-quarters fighting, but the horse archers were always able to retreat safely and loosed Parthian shots as they withdrew. The legionaries then formed the testudo formation by locking their shields together to present a nearly- impenetrable front to missiles.Dio, Cassius. Roman History: Book 40, 22.2. However, that formation severely restricted their ability in melee combat. The Parthian cataphracts exploited that weakness and repeatedly charged the Roman line, which caused panic and inflicted heavy casualties.Dio, Cassius. Roman History: Book 40, 22.3. When the Romans tried to loosen their formation to repel the cataphracts, the latter rapidly retreated, and the horse archers resumed shooting at the legionaries, who were now more exposed. Crassus now hoped that his legionaries could hold out until the Parthians ran out of arrows.Plutarch. Life of Crassus, 25.1. However, Surena used thousands of camels to resupply his horse archers. Upon his realisation, Crassus dispatched his son Publius with 1,300 Gallic cavalry, 500 archers and eight cohorts of legionaries to drive off the horse archers. The horse archers feigned retreat and drew off Publius' force, which suffered heavy casualties from arrow fire. Once Publius and his men were sufficiently separated from the rest of the army, the Parthian cataphracts confronted them while the horse archers cut off their retreat. In the ensuing combat, the Gauls fought bravely, but their inferiority in weapons and armor was evident. They eventually retreated to a hill, where Publius committed suicide while the rest of his men were slaughtered, only 500 of whom taken alive.Plutarch. Life of Crassus, 25.7‚Äì12. Crassus, unaware of his son's fate but realising that Publius was in danger, ordered a general advance. He was confronted with the sight of his son's head on a spear. The Parthian horse archers began to surround the Roman infantry and shot at them from all directions. Meanwhile, the cataphracts mounted a series of charges that disorganised the Romans. The Parthian onslaught did not cease until nightfall. Crassus, deeply shaken by his son's death, ordered a retreat to the nearby town of Carrhae and left behind 4000 wounded, who were killed by the Parthians the next morning.Plutarch. Life of Crassus, 28.1. Four Roman cohorts got lost in the dark and were surrounded on a hill by the Parthians, with only 20 Romans surviving.Plutarch. Life of Crassus, 28.2. The next day, Surena sent a message to the Romans and offered to negotiate with Crassus. Surena proposed a truce to allow the Roman army to return to Syria safely in exchange for Rome giving up all territory east of the Euphrates. Surena either sent an embassy to the Romans by the hills or went himself to state he wanted a peace conference on an evacuation.Dio, Cassius. Roman History: Book 40, 26.1. Crassus was reluctant to meet with the Parthians, but his troops threatened to mutiny otherwise.Plutarch. Life of Crassus, 30.5. At the meeting, a Parthian pulled at Crassus's reins and sparked violence in which Crassus and his generals were killed. After his death, the Parthians allegedly poured molten gold down his throat in a symbolic gesture mocking Crassus's renowned greed.Dio, Cassius. Roman History: Book 40, 26.3. The remaining Romans at Carrhae attempted to flee, but most were captured or killed. Roman casualties amounted to about 20,000 killed and 10,000 captured,Plutarch. Life of Crassus, 31.7. which made the battle one of the costliest defeats in Roman history. However, Parthian casualties were minimal.  Aftermath  Roman coin of Augustus (19 BC) showing a Parthian soldier returning the standards captured at Carrhae. Augustus hailed the return of the standards as a political victory over Parthia. Rome was humiliated by this defeat, which was made even worse by the fact that the Parthians had captured several Legionary Eagles.The Deadly Banners of Carrhae , Robert Collins, Silkroad Foundation. Retrieved 10 May 2007 It is also mentioned by Plutarch that the Parthians found the Roman prisoner-of-war who most resembled Crassus, dressed him as a woman and paraded him through Parthia for all to see.Plutarch, 'Life Of Crassus,' p 418: \\"That one of his captives who bore the greatest likeness to Crassus, Caius Paccianus, put on a woman's royal robe, and under instructions to answer to the name of Crassus and the title of Imperator when so addressed, was conducted along on horseback\\". , with the rest of the Parthian Army, defeated the Armenians and captured their country. However, Surena's victory invoked the jealousy of the Parthian king, who ordered Surena's execution. Following Surena's death, himself took command of the Parthian army and led an unsuccessful military campaign into Syria. The Battle of Carrhae was one of the first major battles between the Romans and Parthians. It was the victory that led Parthia to invade Syria and Armenia several times, with varying successes. Rome also realised that its legionaries could not effectively fight against Parthian cavalry. Parthian horseman Gaius Cassius Longinus, a quaestor under Crassus, led approximately 10,000 surviving soldiers from the battlefield back to Syria, where he governed as a proquaestor for two years, defending Syria from 's further attacks. He received praise from Cicero for his victory. Cassius later played a key role in the conspiracy to assassinate Julius Caesar in 44 BC. The 10,000 Roman prisoners of war appear to have been deported to Alexandria Margiana (Merv) near the eastern border in 53 BC, where they reportedly married to local people. It has been hypothesized that some of them founded the Chinese city of Liqian after they had become soldiers for the Xiongnu during the Battle of Zhizhi against the Han dynasty, but that is disputed.http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/deportations  Legacy  Detail from the breastplate of Augustus Prima Porta, showing a Parthian man returning the aquila lost by Crassus at the Battle of Carrhae The capture of the golden aquilae (legionary battle standards) by the Parthians was considered a grave moral defeat and evil omen for the Romans. When he was assassinated, Caesar was planning a retaliatory war. It was said that there would have been harsh retribution if Caesar won because the surviving son of Crassus would be among the Roman forces.Pompeius Trogus, in the epitome of Justin, 42.4.6. However, the fall of the Roman Republic intervened, and the beginning of imperial monarchy at Rome followed. Sulla's first march on Rome in 88 BC had begun the collapse of the republican form of government, but the death of Crassus and the loss of his legions utterly reconfigured the balance of power at Rome.The Romans: From Village to Empire, Mary T. Boatwright An old theory ran that the death of Crassus, along with the death of Julia in 54, Pompey's wife and Caesar's daughter, may have severed the ties between Caesar and Pompey, and the First Triumvirate no longer existed. As a result, civil war broke out. Caesar won, and the Republic quickly became an autocratic dictatorship. Several historians note the lapse of time between Crassus's death and the outbreak of civil war. Gaius Stern has claimed that the death nearly cut the links the First Triumvirate enjoyed with the blue-blooded aristocracy, leaving the entire state vulnerable to the friction that eventually turned into civil war.‚ÄúThe Ides of March, Why They Killed Julius,‚Äù public lecture, Berkeley, 2 March 2008 Thus, an immediate effect of the battle may have been the elimination of certain private checks and balances (such as Crassus's relationship to Metellus Pius Scipio) that had kept a lid on political tensions. It is rumoured that some of the survivors of Crassus's army ended up in China. In the 1940s, Homer H. Dubs, a professor of Chinese history at the University of Oxford, suggested that the people of Liqian were descended from Roman soldiers taken prisoner after the battle. The prisoners, Dubs proposed, were resettled by the Parthians on their eastern border and may have fought as mercenaries at the Battle of Zhizhi between the Chinese and the Xiongnu in 36 BC. Chinese chroniclers mention the use of a \\"fish-scale formation\\" of soldiers, which Dubs believed referred to the testudo formation. To date, no artifacts that might confirm a Roman presence, such as coins or weaponry, have been discovered in Zhelaizhai. Rob Gifford, commenting on the theory, described it as one of many \\"rural myths\\". Alfred Duggan used the possible fate of the Roman prisoners as the kernel of his novel Winter Quarters, which suggested that they were employed as frontier guards on the eastern border of the Parthian Empire.

Venkateswaran signed on Thirupathisamy to direct Vijay in an action film titled Velan. The film, a remake of the director's Telugu film Azad, saw Priyanka Chopra, winner of the beauty pageant Miss World 2000, being brought in by Venkateswaren to make her debut and play the lead female role. However, before production began, Thirupathisamy died in an accident and Venkateswaren duly decided to give debutant Majith a chance to direct a film with the same cast. Gautami was initially selected to play Vijay's sister in the film, but was later replaced by Revathi. Vivek was signed on to film comedy scenes for a sum of 15 lakh. A new technical team of music director 18-year-old Imman, who had scored for serials earlier, and cinematographer Ekambaram, who had apprenticed with Jeeva, were also selected. Furthermore, the sets were designed by Sabu Cyril, dance choreography was by Raju Sundaram, and stunts were arranged by Super Subbarayan. A scene for the film featured the producer and lyricist Vairamuthu making guest appearances as themselves during a book launch event. The patriotic nature of the film led to a postal stamp being released with Vijay's face on it. The similarities of title and release date between Thamizhan and the Prashanth-starrer Thamizh created confusion, with the producers of both films unable to accommodate any changes. The commercial success of the movie led Vijay to portray the role of a lawyer again for a second time in his career, in the 2005 action movie Sukran.

The prominent event in his life was Austria-Hungary's entry into the First World War when he was prime minister for the second time. He was later assassinated during the Aster Revolution on 31 October 1918 - the same day that Hungary terminated its real union with Austria. Tisza supported the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary and was representative of the then liberal-conservative consent.

He himself supported the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. A social reactionary to the end, Tisza stubbornly opposed on principle the break-up of the large landed estates as well as even the most modest reform proposals that would have granted the suffrage to soldiers fighting at the frontRobert A.

However, in economic affairs, he tended to be a modernizer who encouraged and supported industrialization and, in that respect, he was an opponent of anti-Semitism, which he feared could jeopardize Hungary's economic development. Among the Hungarian political leaders, Tisza was the most zealous adherent of Dualism and the partnership with Austria.Stephen Tisza article of the 1922 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica The Austro-Hungarian Compromise, the Liberal party and Istv√°n Tisza remained bitterly unpopularCieger Andr√°s.

Nationalities and the Hungarian Parliament (1867‚Äì1918). In the diplomacy, Tisza's role model was Otto von Bismarck. As an economist, he followed the concepts of the English historical school of economics, as a lawyer and political scientist, Tisza favored the societal and political development of England, which he considered as the \\"ideal way of development\\".Zolt√°n Maruzsa, Political scientist, ELTE University: Early life and education Istv√°n Tisza was the son of K√°lm√°n Tisza de Borosjen≈ë, prime minister of Hungary between 1875‚Äì1890 from the Liberal Party. The Tiszas were originally a Calvinist untitled lower nobility (regarded as equivalent to the British gentry). His mother, Countess Helene von Degenfeld-Schonburg, was a Hungarian- German aristocrat from Baden-W√ºrttemberg (born: Helene Johanna Josepha Mathilde Gr√§fin von Degenfeld-Schonburg).Degenfeld Kastely biographical data The young Stephen raised in a puritanical and authoritarian Calvinist environment with high expectations. Stephen has studied at home until the age of twelve, then he entered the Calvinist Gymnasium (a college-preparatory school) of Debrecen. Tisza took legal studies in Budapest, international law in Heidelberg University, economics in Humboldt University of Berlin, where he received PHD, and political science in Oxford University, where he received a doctorate in political science. Initially, he became acquainted with the practical issues of public administration at the Ministry of the Interior. Several studies on the agricultural issue were published in the Budapest Review. After serving 1 year as a volunteer hussar in the Royal Hungarian Honv√©d army, he got the rank of hussar officer. He settled in Bihar County and took an active part in the political and economic life of the county as a committee member and honorary chief notary of Bihar county. Political career =Tisza as member of the parliament= He then took care of the family land at Bihar County and Geszt for five years. He won his first parliamentary electoral mandate in 1886 with the Liberal Party in V√≠zakna (Now: Ocna Sibiului, Romania), a Transylvanian electoral district, and he represented the district until 1892. He won his second seat in 1892 as representative of √öjb√°nya district (Now: Nov√° Ba≈àa, Slovakia). In 1896 he won the seat of Ugra district (Now: Ungra, Romania) and he became also a member of the economic committee of Hungarian parliament, where he plunged himself into the macroeconomic discussions. In the 1890s he served a number of sinecures which provided extraordinary income, a common situation among prestigious European politicians of the time. He was the president of the Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank (Magyar Ipar- √©s Kereskedelmi Bank) and was a member of the boards of numerous joint-stock companies and industrial enterprises. Despite the financial crisis of the 1890s, under his control many of these enterprises became the fastest emerging companies of the realm, some of them became unavoidable enterprises in their own sectors. His instructions and rule transformed the mediocre Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank into the largest Bank of Hungary within a decade. His uncle, the childless Lajos Tisza received the title of Count from Emperor Franz Joseph in 1897. However, Lajos Tisza conferred his new title on his nephew Stephen with the consent of the Monarch on 16 February 1897. =Prime minister for first time, 1903‚Äì1905= He was chairman and board member of several financial institutions (eg the Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank) and many industrial companies, but resigned from all of his memberships before he was appointed as Prime minister. Target of Leftist and socialist circles In this period he managed to get the remains of Francis II R√°k√≥czi repatriated from Turkey and interred in the cathedral of Kassa, today Ko≈°ice. On April 19, 1904, nationwide strike of railroad workers broke out, which paralyzed the Hungarian economy. Tisza solved the crisis quickly but drastically: the organizers of the strike were arrested, and participant railway workers were recruited into the Hungarian Honv√©d army. The Parliament approved the increase of conscriptees. The police crushed a Socialist gathering for peasants in Bihar, leaving 33 dead and several hundred wounded. Target of anti-Semite circles Tisza often used his influence in parliament to grant titles to wealthy Jewish families, especially successful industrialists and bankers, and set them and their success as an example for the people. Many families of young middle class were Jews or baptized Jews. Tisza often gathered influential men of Jewish extraction to advise him. He even offered many positions in his cabinet to Jews. His first appointment was Samu Hazai as Minister of War. Two years later he picked J√°nos Teleszky as minister of finance. The third Jewish member of his cabinet was J√°nos Hark√°nyi, minister of trade. Tisza appointed Samu Hazai as Minister of War during his second premiere. They all served for the duration of Tisza's seven years in office. The Liberal Party passed legislation for Jewish emancipation in 1867, and appointed many Jewish origin MEPs to the parliament (both the upper and lower houses). In return, many Jews supported the party. Many districts of Budapest, where Jews made up half of the voters, reliably voted for the Liberal candidate. Similarly to the policy of his father, Istv√°n Tisza allowed the unrestricted immigration of Jewish refugees from the Russian Empire, who fled from the Tzarist pogroms. His philosemitic political attitude made him a target of anti-Semite politicians and political circles. Target of radical nationalists During the era, only 54.5% (1910 census1910\\\\. √©vi n√©psz√°ml√°l√°s adatai. (Magyar Statisztikai K√∂zlem√©nyek, Budapest, 1912. pp 30‚Äì33)) of the population of kingdom of Hungary considered themselves as Hungarians. Tisza's party (The Liberal Party of Hungary) urgently needed the support of minorities to maintain the majority of the party in the Hungarian parliament. The liberal party was the most popular political force in the electoral districts where the ethnic minorities represented the local majority. However his main political opponents (The nationalist Party of Independence and '48 and Catholic People's Party) could collect mandates only from the Hungarian majority electoral districts.See: Zolt√°n Maruzsa =\\"Election by handkerchief\\" and the victory of nationalist opposition= He passed a modification to the rules of the House of Parliament on 18 November 1904 to crush the obstruction of the opposition. In earlier era, the members of the parliament had unrestricted time to give speech or talk in the parliament. From the first his ministry was exposed to the most unscrupulous opposition, exacerbated by the new and stringent rules of procedure which Tisza felt it his duty to introduce if any business were to be done. The motion for their introduction was made by the deputy G√°bor Daniel, supported by the premier, and after scenes of unheard-of obstruction and violence (16‚Äì18 November) the speaker, in the midst of an ear-splitting tumult, declared that the new regulations had been adopted by the house, and produced a royal message suspending the session. But the Andr√°ssy group, immediately afterwards, separated from the Liberal Party, and the rest of the year the Opposition made the legislation impossible. By January 1905 the situation had become ex lex or anarchical. Tisza stoutly stood by his rules, on the ground that this was a case in which the form must be sacrificed to the substance of parliamentary government.\\"Stephen Tisza\\" in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 11th ed. 1911., VOLUME: XXVI, page:1017 Dezs≈ë Perczel, the President of the House, called for immediate voting on the modification. It is not clear what exactly happened, but some sources say that the Speaker of the House of Parliament waved a handkerchief, signalling for the governing party to vote \\"yes\\"; this act later became known as the \\"election by handkerchief\\", which became a large scandal and, as a consequence, K√°lm√°n Sz√©ll and Gyula Andr√°ssy left the Liberal Party and the opposition unified into the \\"Federal Opposition\\". The political powers polarised and in new elections the 30 years of governing by the Liberal Party was ended, with the side effect that the party was dissolved. After the defeat of his Liberal Party by the nationalist coalition in the 1905 elections, Tisza only took part in the operations of the Upper House of Parliament (similar to House of Lords in Britain), staying away from political struggles. However, his political opponent the governing Independence and '48 Party was unable to withhold positions to protect the interests of Hungary so it resigned on 25 April 1909. Tisza and his son with ministers and leaders of the Liberal Party in his family estate at Geszt in 1904 =National Party of Work, electoral victory in 1910= Arad in 1910 Tisza gives an electoral speech in Sopron in April 1910 On 19 February 1910, Tisza established the National Party of Work (Nemzeti Munkap√°rt) which subsequently won the election of 1910. He did not desire to form a government, primarily due to his conflict with Franz Ferdinand who sought to centralise the Habsburg Monarchy with universal suffrage. Tisza opposed this initiative, as he believed that this would lead to the weakening of the Magyar supremacy over ethnic minorities in Hungary. In addition, he claimed \\"demagogues (i.e. Communists and agrarian socialist movements) would manipulate peasants with the majority of the votes to put in power such groups whose aims are against democracy, supported by the urban intellectuals\\".A magyar jobboldali hagyom√°ny (Hungarian Right-Wing Heritage), 1900‚Äì1948. Edited by Ign√°c Romcsics, Osiris, 2009. pp. 65. Tisza was supported by Franz Josef, but he feared a repeat of the faults of his first prime ministry and thus called for K√°roly Khuen- H√©derv√°ry to form the new government. Despite Tisza was not prime minister again until 1913, as the founder of the National Party of Work, his power and influence on the ruling majority party was completely absolute. In this way Tisza could remain the keyfigure of Hungarian politics and legislation behind the curtains, even without having premiership. Istv√°n Tisza (right) with Emperor-King Francis Joseph Act of Protection Istv√°n Tisza in 1914 As Speaker of the House of Representatives from 22 May 1912 to 12 June 1913 Tisza supported the reform of the common Austro-Hungarian army to enhance the military power of the dual monarchy. The Hungarian side was fighting for more Hungarian interests (i.e. use of the Magyar language in the army). Tisza and his party refused the idea of universal suffrage. According to his threatening prediction, the majority votes of peasants - manipulated by primitive demagogues - would result in the domination of groups whose goals are just contrary to the ideals of metropolitan intellectuals and socialists who call for democracy. The Socialists strongly opposed his acts and decided to organize a protest march. Socialist agents organised a worker rebellion on 22 May 1912 (Blood-Red Thursday), calling for Tisza to resign as President of the House and calling for universal suffrage. On the next day, the protesters and workers marched toward the Parliament building, meanwhile the events transformed to violence, protesters broke the shop windows in the surrounding streets, automobiles and tramcard were damaged by the masses. However the protesters were stopped by the storm of hussar cavalry units, and they were arrested by the police. Six people died in the clashes, nearly two hundred were injured and three hundred were arrested. This event became known as \\"Blood-Red Thursday\\" in the contemporary press and later in the history books. Tisza tried to solve the question of ethnic minorities based on a clerical approach (like the representation of Orthodox and Greek Catholic Church in The Upper House of the parliament). He was convinced that the challenging foreign situation called for military preparation and he strongly pushed against opposition obstruction. He did not allow the opposition to speak up regarding rules of House of Parliament. Referring to an act of 1848, he called for the police force to force out numerous opposition representatives. He managed to pass the Act of Protection, resulting in the removal of some members of the opposition party. As a result, Gyula Kov√°cs, an opposition party representative, tried to assassinate Tisza in the Parliament Building on 7 June 1912. His shots missed and the marks are still visible in the Hungarian Parliament Building to this day. With his last shot Kov√°cs shot himself, but he survived. Tisza then continued the session. = Prime minister for second time, 1913‚Äì1917 = Tisza became prime minister again on 7 June 1913. Freedom of the press Inspired by the Western European model, Tisza's cabinet introduced for the first time in the history of Hungarian journalism the legal category of defamation, libel and \\"scare-mongering\\", thus the press became actionable before the courts. Journalists and newspapers had to pay compensations for the victims of defamation and libel. Despite these institutions and laws worked well in Western Europe and in the United States, the contemporary Hungarian newspapers and journalists considered it as the violation of the Freedom of Speech and the Freedom of Press. Croatia Count Istv√°n Tisza tried to solve the Hungarian-Croatian issue, which had long lasted at that time, to clarify the relationship; for this matter, he met Count Tivadar Pej√°csevich, Count of Verovce, Croatian Ban, and a year later, Baron Lomnica, Ivan Skerlecz, the new Croatian Ban. Tisza maintained his conciliatory position, promising to reestablish the Croatian Constitution, which was suspended in May 1912. Tisza appointed his old family friend, the ≈†okci origin aristocrat, Baron Ivan Skerlecz as the new ban of Croatia. Negotiations between the Croatian representatives and Tisza bore fruit and allowed the restitution of the Croatian constitutional government in November 1913. Foreign policy and the Great War Tisza and H√∂tzendorf left Vienna after 3 days long fierce debate. A few days before the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, which resulted in World War I, Tisza supported a strong stand against Serbia. However, after the assassination he was against going to war against Serbia, a rare view in Austria-Hungary. He knew the army's strength, and he was afraid that with the increase of more Slavic territories the equilibrium inside the monarchy would be upset. Moreover, he was afraid that Romania would attack Transylvania.K√∂peczy-Makkai-M√≥csy-Sz√°sz: History of Transylvania The loss of the alliance with the German Empire would have meant the end of Austria-Hungary as a Great Power, so he gave in and supported the war. He then became a relentless supporter of the war until its end. Tisza believed Romania to be an enemy from the beginning. He was afraid that if Romania attacked Hungary then the Romanians in Transylvania would revolt against Hungary. In the end, 40,000 soldiers were moved to protect Transylvania. During the war, the reformists became more and more powerful, but he continued to oppose them. At the time, Tisza was seen as forcing the continuation of the war and was losing a great deal of support. He opposed the ideas of the new Emperor, Karl I, and was asked to resign; he did so on 23 May 1917.https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/crisis-in-austria-hungary However, he retained great political influence, and was able to delay the enactment of universal suffrage. During this period of international insecurity, he wanted to solidify the government. During this period, he appointed Baron Stephan Buri√°n von Rajecz who planned to increase the prestige of the monarchy and to get parity with Germany but also to negotiate peace with the help of the Americans. He would fail in the latter, after Germany announced in 1916 that it intended to start full submarine warfare, leading the US to prepare for war. By late October 1918, the dissolution of Austria- Hungary, and the surrender of Germany, were imminent and there was nothing that foreign minister Buri√°n (who was still in that role) could do to change the course of history.ref> Towards the end of the war, Tisza had wanted to convince the Serbs and Bosnians to achieve autonomy within Austria-Hungary. As a homo regius (\\"king's man\\"), he went to Sarajevo to attempt this, but without success. =His judgement from abroad during and after the war= It is clear that after the outbreak of World War I, all opposing sides pointed to the other side as the party guilty of initiating the greater war. The British newspaper \\"New Europe\\" printed a comment that Hungary was the only responsible party for the war, \\"where Hungary‚Ä≤s responsibility is greater than Austria‚Ä≤s\\" and that Tisza was the militaristic politician who dragged all sides into war. As a consequence the \\"Little Entente\\" took this view and pushed to punish Hungary at the end of the war. Later, the propaganda of these nations augmented and even invented Tisza's guilt, claiming that he took pains to point out in a report of 8 July that \\"there should at any rate be no question of the annihilation or annexation of Serbia, and that if Serbia gave way, Austria-Hungary must be content.\\" According to recent findings these accusations are without merit. The accusations are rooted in the common belief that Tisza carried out a policy of forced Magyarization towards the ethnic minorities in Hungary. His minority policy was (directly or indirectly) often confused with the policy of his radical nationalist political opponents in the 1906 -1910 period (like the Party of Independence and '48). =His view on the war= Istv√°n Tisza served on the Italian front between 1917-1918, where he had opportunity to experience the circumstances and dangers of trench warfare on a daily basis Tisza opposed the expansion of the empire on the Balkan (see Bosnian crisis in 1908), because \\"the Dual Monarchy already had too many Slavs\\", which would further threaten the integrity of the Dual Monarchy.William Jannen: Lions of July: Prelude to War, 1914 - PAGE:456 In March 1914, Tisza wrote a memorandum to Emperor Francis Joseph. His letter had strongly apocalyptic predictive and embittered tone. He used exactly the hitherto unknown \\"Weltkrieg\\" (means World War) phrase in his letter. \\"It is my firm conviction that Germany's two neighbors [Russia and France] are carefully proceeding with military preparations, but will not start the war so long as they have not attained a grouping of the Balkan states against us that confronts the monarchy with an attack from three sides and pins down the majority of our forces on our eastern and southern front.\\"David G. Herrmann: The Arming of Europe and the Making of the First World War - PAGE: 211, Princeton University Press, (1997) On the day of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, Tisza immediately traveled to Vienna where he met Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Berchtold and Army Commander Conrad von H√∂tzendorf. They proposed to solve the dispute with arms, attacking Serbia. Tisza proposed to give the government of Serbia time to take a stand as to whether it was involved in the organisation of the murder and proposed a peaceful resolution, arguing that the international situation would settle soon. Returning to Budapest, he wrote to Franz Joseph saying he would not take any responsibility for the armed conflict because there was no proof that Serbia had plotted the assassination. Tisza opposed a war with Serbia, stating (correctly, as it turned out) that any war with the Serbs was bound to trigger a war with Russia and hence a general European war.Fischer, Fritz: Germany‚Äôs Aims in the First World War, New York, W.W. Norton, 1967, (PAGE: 52) He thought that even a successful Austro-Hungarian war would be disastrous for the integrity of Kingdom of Hungary, where Hungary would be the next victim of Austrian politics. After a successful war against Serbia, Tisza adumbrated a possible Austrian military attack against Kingdom of Hungary, where the Austrians want to break up the territory of Hungary. He did not trust in the Italian alliance, due to the political aftermath of the Second Italian War of Independence. He felt the threat of Romania and Bulgaria after the Balkan wars and was afraid of Romanian attack from the east. He was also not sure about the stand of the Germans. Germany's stand was of ultimate importance due to the security of the state. During a conversation between Franz Joseph and Conrad von H√∂tzendorf, Conrad asked, \\"If Germany's reply is that they are on our side, do we engage in war with Serbia?\\" The emperor replied, \\"Then yes\\", \\"But what if they reply differently?\\", \\"Then the Monarchy will be alone\\". Kaiser Wilhelm II supported the war, promised to neutralize a Romanian attack, and put pressure on Sofia. After this, Tisza still sought a peaceful solution, but most of all he wanted to wait for the result of the official examination into the assassination. The only proposal of Tisza, which was accepted, was that the Monarchy should not annihilate Serbia completely in order to avoid Russian support for Serbia. The council finally addressed an ultimatum to the Serbian government and immediately started the mobilisation of troops. After sending the ultimatum, his view changed. The ultimatum was obsolete within 48 hours, so Tisza wrote: \\"it was a difficult decision to take a stand to propose war, but now I am firmly convinced of its necessity\\"Tschirschky's report to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 14 July 1914 He was, however, still opposed to the annexation of Serbia to the Monarchy, but failed. On 4 August 1914 Russia, Germany, Britain and France also entered the war, enlarging it to a world war. Tisza did not resign from the Prime Ministry, as he thought remaining in this position was the best way he could represent Hungarian interests inside Austria-Hungary, as he had connections in Vienna. Moreover, his resignation would have sent a message of weakness to the Entente at the outbreak of war. His initial opposition to the conflict, only became public after the end of World War 1, on 17 October 1918, when he spoke in the Parliament. He said, \\"the Monarchy and the Hungarian nation were longing for peace all the way until there were proofs that the enemy was systematically trying to humiliate and destroy us as soon as possible (...) As we have found proofs that the Serbian government took part in organising the assassination, we could not but address an ultimatum to Serbia ... where we stipulated that the war is preventive.\\" = The struggle of a WW1 political leader in the trenches = The 57 years old Tisza joined to the 2nd Hussar Regiment of Hungary - which served on the Italian front - as a hussar colonel, and personally led his hussar units during the attacks. Tisza at the front: \\"Tisza already felt the not too friendly atmosphere surrounding him at the first days of his joining up to the regiment and at first he tried to ease the general mood by informal behavior. (...) He has made an effort from the beginning to use an informal tone both with the staff of officers and -of course within the limits of the service regulations- with the rank and file. To better get to know each other with his fellow officers, every day he invited some young officers to his table, this way he tried to establish better personal relations with his environment. The troops had slowly started to recognize him as \\"tough to the upwards and humane to the downwards\\" kind of a commander. He distributed his tobacco provisions among the officers and he used his commander pay to improve the catering of the troops, and these of course left a good impression on everybody. Tisza's paternalistic attitude towards his subordinates also manifested itself in civil law cases: he helped with his personal influence in getting done of those petitions what he considered fair, he interceded with notaries, judges, alisp√°ns (deputy-lieutenants) for advancing the home affairs of his men, due to this both the officers and the troops more and more came to like and embrace him. Tisza himself also felt that the front service had been quite useful and productive since on the one hand he could personally experience the dangers of the battleground an on the other hand-at least he was thinking that way and there is a lot of truth in it-he could truly become familiar with the real nature of the simple, peasant origin soldiers. He wrote about peasant soldiers in this way in a letter to Archduke Joseph: \\"I‚Äôve got to truly know the ordinary [peasants] people now. This is the most extraordinary race of the world that can only be loved and respected. How unfortunate that the political intelligentia doesn‚Äôt do anything else, just corrupts this great and God-blessed people.\\"Peter Strausz: (Hungarian) \\"Istv√°n Tisza and the Second Hussar Regiment\\" Assassination attempts Monument to Tisza Istvan outside the Budapest Parliament building For many, he was the representative of the war policy in the Monarchy, so he was an assassination target. The fourth assassination attempt against him was successful. The first attempt was made in the Hungarian parliament in 1912 by Gyula Kov√°cs, an opposition politician. He shot two bullets, but missed Tisza. Kov√°cs was arrested by the police, but he was acquitted by the court, the justification was \\"temporary insanity\\". The second was made by a soldier when Tisza was returning from the front line during the war. The bullet missed him. The third attempt came on 16 October 1918 when J√°nos L√©kai, a member of the society Galilei-circle and an anti-military group led by Ott√≥ Korvin, tried to kill Tisza while he was leaving the Hungarian Parliament, but the revolver malfunctioned and Tisza managed to flee.Andr√°s Sikl√≥s. Revolution in Hungary and the Dissolution of the Multinational State. 1918. Studia Historica. Vol. 189. Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae. Budapest, 1988; p.32-33 The assassin was sent to prison but was released after 15 days during the Chrysanthemum Revolution. The fourth and successful attempt came on 31 October 1918, when soldiers broke into his home, the R√≥heim Villa in Budapest, Hermina √∫t 35., (today the Villa is at nr. 45.) in front of his wife and his grandniece. Some sources suggest these were disgruntled deserters who blamed Tisza for having started the war. Subsequently, Mih√°ly K√°rolyi's government initiated an investigation but the identity of the killers was not confirmed at that time, however, family members had identified individuals that they said were the killers. In the trial that followed the fall of the Communist regime and ended on 6 October 1921, Judge Istv√°n Gad√≥ established the guilt of P√°l K√©ri, who was exchanged with the Soviet Union; J√≥zsef Pog√°ny, aka John Pepper, who fled to Vienna, then Moscow and the USA; Istv√°n Dob√≥; Tivadar Horv√°th Sanovics, who also fled; S√°ndor H√ºttner, who died in a prison hospital in 1923; and Tibor Sztanykovszky, who was the only one to serve his 18-year sentence, being released in 1938. Sigmund Freud, Austrian neurologist ‚Äì who knew both politicians personally, wrote about the assassination of Istv√°n Tisza and the appointment of Mih√°ly K√°rolyi as new prime minister of Hungary: Personal life He married his first degree cousin, Ilona Tisza de Borosjen≈ë.

Having been taught by \\"the best masters in Germany, France and Italy\\", he was equally adept with sword or pistol, despite (by 1913) having had a cataract operation on one of his eyes and wearing \\"think horn-rimmed spectacles\\". In January 1913, he fought Mih√°ly K√°rolyi in a 34-bout duel with cavalry sabres which lasted an hour until Tisza cut K√°rolyi's arm and the seconds ended the duel. A week later he fought Alad√°r Sz√©chenyi, again with sabres - the duel lasted one bout, ending with Tisza wounding Sz√©chenyi with \\"a long cut across the head\\". On about 20 August 1913, Tisza fought Gy√∂rgy Pallavacini (son-in-law and supporter of Opposition leader Gyula Andr√°ssy) at a Budapest fencing school in a duel with \\"heavy cavalry sabres\\" and \\"only slight protection of the body was allowed\\". After nine bouts, both duellists were bleeding from cuts to their foreheads, and the seconds declared both principals unable to continue - \\"[t]he two men shook hands, then embraced, kissing each other on both cheeks, and declared themselves reconciled.\\" Honors Istv√°n Tisza postage stamp was issued by Hungary on 1 July 1932 in the Famous Hungarians series.colnect.com/en/stamps/stamp/141651-Count_Istv√°n_Tisza_1861-1918_politician- Personalities-Hungary Works and Publications =Historical Studies= \\\\- About Barras' memoirs \\\\- From Sadowa to Sedan \\\\- Wertheimer's Andr√°ssy \\\\- European cruise in the 17th century \\\\- A few more words about Benedict's tragedy \\\\- Historical materialism in the Balkans =Electoral Studies= -Preface to the volume about the political franchise -The Austrian election -The Austrian House of Representatives -The result of the German election -Hieronymi on the political franchise -Electoral Reform and Industrial Workers -On the verge of electoral reform -General suffrage and the dynasty =Economics= -Theory of tax evasion (1882) -Hungarian agricultural policy (1883) -The Agricultural Question (1887) -American competition on the European wheat market (1888) -Sorting of our currency (1890) -About the Budget of 1890 (1890) -The Budget of 1891 (1890) -The Budget of 1892 (1892) -Currency Exchange & Gold Pricing (1893) -G√°bor Baross and his system (1894) -A few more words about Baross's railway policy (1894) -Our export on the Austrian railways and the customs union -About the inflation -20,000 crowns =Other studies and dissertations= -Public status of Rijeka (1883) -Once again on the public law status of Rijeka (1883) -The Fight for Parliamentarism: Speeches by Count Istv√°n Tisza (1904) -Gyula Andr√°ssy on art -Agnosticism -About K√°roly Hieronymi -Austrian work on the 67th anniversary of the Compromise -Pietreich on Protective Law -Compulsory insurance and local government -Crisis of the British House of Lords -One word or two about parliamentarianism -Nation and society -Gyula Wlassics in the 1867: XII. t.-c. legal nature -A few words in response to √ñd√∂n Polner -A little browsing in the field of English parliamentarism -A little controversy -Notice to the article by Mih√°ly R√©z -Approach of Austrian Germans -Nationalization and local government -The impact of war on the nation See also * Austro-Hungarian entry into World War I Notes References *De√°k, Istvan \\"The Decline and Fall of Habsburg Hungary, 1914‚Äì18\\" pages 10‚Äì30 from Hungary in Revolution edited by Ivan Volgyes Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1971. *Menczer, B√©la \\"Bela Kun and the Hungarian Revolution of 1919\\" pages 299‚Äì309 from History Today Volume XIX, Issue #5, May 1969, History Today Inc: London. *Vermes, G√°bor. \\"The October Revolution In Hungary\\" pages 31‚Äì60 from Hungary in Revolution edited by Ivan Volgyes Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1971. * Vermes, G√°bor..

Conversely, if they are paid, they will work to prevent others from embarrassing the company, either through intimidation or by disrupting the meeting so they cannot be heard. History S≈çkaiya originate from the late 19th century. At this time, the unlimited liability of the management put the managers' personal fortune at risk in case of rumors and scandals. Hence the management hired protection, called s≈çkaiya, to reduce the risk of such rumors. Even after the Japanese laws included a limited liability, hence reducing the personal risk to the managers, these s≈çkaiya continued to prosper, and were often used to quiet down otherwise difficult meetings. In that respect, they have even been compared to corporate lawyers in America. In 1984, the law made first steps to reduce the threat from s≈çkaiya by establishing a minimum number of holdings (¬•50,000) in order to be allowed into the shareholder meeting, leading to a slow decline of the number of s≈çkaiya. In response to this, the s≈çkaiya formed fake uyoku dantai, announcing embarrassing company secrets, fictional or not, from loudspeakers mounted on trucks in order to extort money from companies. In 1994, Juntar≈ç Suzuki, vice president of Fujifilm, was murdered by s≈çkaiya after he stopped paying these bribes.S≈çkaiya and Japanese Corporations, Eiko Maruko, Electronic Journal of Contemporary Japanese Studies, 25 June 2002 Activities =Disrupting shareholder meetings= Individuals acquire enough stock from multiple companies in order to gain entrance to a shareholders' meeting. There, they disrupt the meeting (and embarrass the company) until their demands are met. For this, the s≈çkaiya often research the company in detail beforehand to uncover incidents of misconduct or other company secrets, and then blackmail the management so that these issues are not raised in the shareholder meeting or elsewhere. Often, they also invent fictional issues that the company would have a difficult time disproving. Modern s≈çkaiya have developed other, similar methods to accomplish their goals. One less subtle example is the banzai s≈çkaiya, who disrupt business places with their cries of \\"Banzai!\\" and praise of the Emperor until they are quietly paid to leave. =Other disruption= S≈çkaiya also form fake groups, announcing embarrassing company secrets, fictional or not, from loudspeakers mounted on trucks in order to extort money from companies. They may also print special newspapers with topics embarrassing to companies, and then ask the company to buy the entire print at inflated prices, or even to subscribe to these newspapers, generating a steady flow of cash. =Preventing disruption of shareholder meetings= S≈çkaiya have also been used by companies to drown out questions from legitimate shareholders which company officials do not want presented. One infamous case is related to Minamata disease (mercury poisoning), where the Chisso chemicals company managed to close a number of annual meetings within minutes even though hundreds of protesters wanted to voice their anger. They have also been active against anti-war protesters and other people who may be viewed as a nuisance by the company at a particular time. Countermeasures Article 968 of the Japanese corporations code prohibits s≈çkaiya activity, imposing imprisonment of no more than five years or a fine of no more than ¬•5 million for \\"receiving, demanding or promising a proprietary benefit with regard to\\" statements or the exercise of voting rights at a shareholder or creditor meeting. A practical countermeasure used by large corporations is to hold all shareholder meetings on the same day, so s≈çkaiya cannot disrupt all of them. Background While in the West a shareholders' meeting is usually an earnest discussion between the shareholders and the management, in Japan it is often more of a ceremony, and the management does not feel the need to truly inform shareholders. In this atmosphere, the s≈çkaiya are able to prosper. However, with the trend for more deregulation in the Japanese market the business environment for s≈çkaiya is getting more and more difficult. Companies that have bribed s≈çkaiya Major companies that have been found guilty of employing s≈çkaiya include but are not limited to: *Mitsubishi, resulting in a number of arrests *Daiwa Securities Group *Nikko Securities *Nomura Securities Co., with three top executive pleading guilty for multimillion-dollar payments. In this case, the s≈çkaiya actually owned enough stock to propose one of their choosing as a member for the board of directors. *Nippon Shinpan, forcing the president Yoji Yamada into retirement after various executives paid up to ¬•80 million to the subsequently arrested Kikuo Kondo of the Sumiyoshi-kai. *The Tokyo Electric Power Company *Meiji Seika References Further reading * Baldwin, Frank, \\"S≈çkaiya, the Idiom of Contemporary Japan\\", Japan Interpreter, 8, Winter 1974 * Ogino, Hiroshi, \\"The S≈çkaiya's Grip on Corporate Japan\\", JQ, July‚ÄìSeptember, 1997 * Szymkowiak, Kenneth, \\"S≈çkaiya Criminal Group and the Conflict for Corporate Power in Postwar Japan\\", Asia Profile, Vol. 20, No. 4, August, 1992 * Szymkowiak, Kenneth, \\"S≈çkaiya: An Examination of the Social and Legal Development of Japan's Corporate Extortionist\\", International Journal of the Sociology of Law, Vol. 22, 1994 External links *Japan faces fresh scandal, cnn.com, March 11, 1997 *'Sokaiya' scams hit Japan, cnn.com, December 19, 1997 *Executive quits over gangster charges, BBC News, 21 November 2002 Category:Japanese business law Category:Japanese business terms Category:Racketeering Category:Yakuza ","title":"S≈çkaiya"},{"id":"925529","text":"Hillsong may refer to: Churches * Hillsong Church, a church in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia ** Hillsong Brisbane ** Hillsong NYC ** Hillsong Church UK Music * Hillsong musicians * Hillsong Global Project, musical project by Hillsong Music Australia working with various Hillsong Church campuses around the world, to create nine albums in nine different languages featuring Hillsong songs (Spanish, Portuguese, Korean, Mandarin, Indonesian, German, French, Swedish and Russian). * Hillsong Music Australia, music produced by Hillsong Church * Hillsong United, Australian band that originated as a part of Hillsong Church, formed in 1998 ** Hillsong United: Live in Miami, eleventh live album/DVD by contemporary Christian worship band Hillsong United * Hillsong Young & Free, Australian contemporary worship music group from Sydney, Australia, where they started making Christian music in 2012 * Hillsong Worship, Australian band that originated as a part of Hillsong Church, formed in 1983 Television * Hillsong Channel, an American and Australian Christian-based broadcast television network Others * Hillsong International Leadership College, in Baulkham Hills, New South Wales, Australia * Hillsong: Let Hope Rise, a 2016 documentary about Hillsong United * Shan'ge, Chinese hill songs See also *Mountain song (disambiguation) ","title":"Hillsong"},{"id":"925533","title":"Elections in Denmark"},{"id":"925538","text":"French presidential election of 2007: election officials and a standard transparent ballot box. France is a representative democracy. Public officials in the legislative and executive branches are either elected by the citizens (directly or indirectly) or appointed by elected officials. Referendums may also be called to consult the French citizenry directly on a particular question, especially one which concerns amendment to the Constitution. France elects on its national level a head of state ‚Äì the president ‚Äì and a legislature. * The president is elected for a five-year term (previously, seven years), directly by the citizens. * The Parliament () has two chambers. ** The National Assembly () has 577 members, elected for a five- year term in single seat-constituencies directly by the citizens. ** The Senate () has 348 members, elected for six-year terms. 328 members are elected by an electoral college consisting of elected representatives from each of 96 departments in metropolitan France, 8 of which are elected from other dependencies, and 12 of which are elected by the French Assembly of French Citizens Abroad () which has replaced the High Council of French Citizens Abroad () a 155-member assembly elected by citizens living abroad. In addition, French citizens elect a variety of local governments. There also are public elections for some non-political positions, such as those for the judges of courts administering labour law (), elected by workers and employers, or those for judges administering cases of rural land leases. French politics has ordinarily displayed some tendencies characterizing a two- party system in which power alternates between relatively stable coalitions, each being led by a major party: on the left, the Socialist Party, on the right, and its predecessors. This pattern was upset in 2017, when neither of those parties' candidates reached the second round of the presidential election and the newly formed party gained both the presidency and a comfortable majority in the National Assembly. Elections are conducted according to rules set down in the Constitution of France, organisational laws (), and the electoral code. Voting is not compulsory. Elections are held on Sundays. The campaigns end at midnight the Friday before the election; then, on election Sunday, by law, no polls can be published,Law 77-808 of 19 July 1977 relative to publication and broadcasting of certain opinion polls, article 11 no electoral publication and broadcasts can be made. The voting stations open at 8 am and close at 6 pm in small towns or at 8 pm in cities, depending on prefectoral decisions. By law, publication of results or estimates is prohibited prior to that time; such results are however often available from the media of e.g. Belgium and Switzerland, or from foreign Internet sites, prior to that time. The first estimate of the results are thus known at Sunday, 8pm, Paris time; one consequence is that voters in e.g. French Guiana, Martinique and Guadeloupe knew the probable results of elections before polling booths close. It has been alleged that this discourages voting in these places. For this reason, since the 2000s, elections in French possessions in the Americas, as well as embassies and consulates there, are held on Saturdays as a special exemption. The next election will take place in 2022. Current President Emmanuel Macron is eligible for re-election in that year. Voters Standard transparent ballot box used in France. The voter puts the envelope containing the name or the list of people for whom he or she votes and then signs the electoral roll to avoid double votes. Some French cities use voting machines. With the exception of senatorial election, for which there is an electoral college, the voters are French citizens over the age of 18 registered on the electoral rolls. People are automatically registered on reaching the age of 18. For municipal and European, but not national elections, citizens aged 18 or older of other European Union countries may vote in France. Registration is not compulsory, but the absence of registration precludes the possibility of voting. Citizens may register either in their place of residence or in a place where they have been on the roll of taxpayers for local taxes for at least 5 years, but not in more than one place. Citizens living abroad may register at the consulate responsible for the region in which they live. Only citizens legally registered as voters can run for public office.Electoral code, L44, LO127, L194 There are exceptions to the above rules. Convicted criminals may be deprived of their civic rights, which include the right to vote, for a certain period of time depending on the crime. In particular, elected officials who have abused public funds may be deprived of the right to run for national public office for as long as 10 years. The application of such rules in the case of certain politicians has been controversial; see for instance the case of Alain Jupp√©. Voting by proxy is possible when the citizen cannot easily attend the polling station (reasons include: health problems, the citizen does not live in the voting constituency, he or she is away for work or vacations, he or she is jailed but has not yet been sentenced and deprived of civic rights etc.) The citizen designates a proxy, who must be a voter from the same commune. The designation of the proxy must be made before a legally capable witness: a judge, a judicial clerk, or an officier of judicial police, or, outside France, before an ambassador or consul. In the case of handicapped or severely ill people, an officer of judicial police or delegate thereof can be sent to the home of the citizen to witness the designation. The procedure is meant to avoid pressures on voters. Electoral system In all elections where there is a single official to be elected for a given area, including the two major national elections (the election of the President of the Republic and the election of the members of the National Assembly), two-round runoff voting is used. For elections to the European Parliament and some local elections, proportional voting is used. =National Assembly= The 577 members of the National Assembly are elected using a two-round system with single-member constituencies. To be elected in the first round, a candidate is required to secure an absolute majority of votes cast, and also to secure votes equal to at least 25% of eligible voters in their constituency. Should none of the candidates satisfy these conditions, a second round of voting ensues. Most constituencies proceed to a second round election. Only first- round candidates with the support of at least 12.5% of eligible voters are allowed to participate, but if only 1 candidate meets that standard the two candidates with the highest number of votes in the first round may continue to the second round. In the second round, the candidate with a plurality is elected. Of the 577 constituencies, 539 are in metropolitan France, 27 are in overseas departments and territories and 11 are for French citizens living abroad. = Party primary elections = Primary elections, within registered political parties, are used to select presidential candidates for the general election. Primaries also use two-round runoff voting when there are multiple candidates within a party. (see :Category:Primary elections in France). Open primaries, where any eligible voter may participate with minimal requirements, also occur. Voting procedures Isolation booth In general, voting is done using paper and manual counting. The voter gets a pre-printed ballot paper (bulletin) from a table at the entrance of the voting office (they are also provided through the mail), as well as an envelope. The voter enters a curtained booth (isoloir), where they are hidden from sight, and inserts the completed ballot paper into an envelope. They walk to the ballot box and may show their voter registration card (not compulsory) and are required to prove their identityElectoral code, R58 (in conurbations with more than 5000 inhabitants, an identification document must be shownElectoral code, R60). After the officials have acknowledged their right to vote, the ballot box is opened and the voter inserts the envelope. One of the officials, traditionally loudly, announces \\"A vot√©! (Has voted!)\\". This is purely ceremonial and has a double meaning: the voter's voix (voice) will be taken into account and they have accomplished their civic duty. The voter then signs the voters' list and their voter registration card is stamped. Procedures differ when electronic voting is used. It is not widespread in France, but is used in some cities, despite controversy over its safety and effectiveness.

The Constitution explicitly states that a referendum can be called only on a Government Bill \\"which deals with the organization of the public authorities, or with reforms relating to the economic or social policy of the Nation, and to the public services contributing thereto, or which provides for authorization to ratify a treaty which, although not contrary to the Constitution, would affect the functioning of the institutions\\" (Article 11 of the Constitution). The second procedure for holding a referendum has several limitations: * it cannot be used to repeal laws which are in effect for less than a year, and * if the proposal fails on a referendum, it cannot be re-submitted to a referendum for next two years. The second procedure for holding a referendum was added to the Constitution in 2008, and it still has not come into effect (as of 2013). It will come into effect when appropriate legislation is implemented by the Parliament. The Constitution of France can be amended in two ways: * on a referendum, or * by three-fifths super-majority of both houses of the Parliament. Most constitutional revisions went through the super-majority of the Parliament in Congress. Ratification of treaties of accession of states to the EU must go through the same procedure as amendment of Constitution of France. All of ratifications went through the super-majority of the Parliament, except the first EU enlargement in 1973. There were 9 referendums in the Fifth Republic: * 2 on Algeria (1961, 1962) * 2 on amending the Constitution (1969, 2000) * 2 on EU treaties (1992, 2005) * French presidential election referendum of 1962, which also amended the Constitution * 1 on EU enlargement (1972) * 1 on New Caledonia (1988) See also * 2012 national electoral calendar * Voting system References External links *Official results from the Ministry of the Interior *thematic files from the Constitutional Council, including election results *Adam Carr's Election Archive *Laurent de Boissieu's Election Archive *Will 2010 regional elections lead to political shake-up? gijon Internationale in English * NSD: European Election Database ‚Äì France publishes regional level election data; allows for comparisons of election results, 1993‚Äì2007 ","title":"Elections in France"},{"id":"925539","text":"Richard Joseph \\"Dick\\" Davisson (December 29, 1922 - June 15, 2004) was an American physicist. Davisson was the son of Clinton Davisson, a Nobel laureate, and Clinton's wife Charlotte. Davisson's maternal uncle, Sir Owen Richardson, was also a Nobel laureate. During World War II he worked on the Manhattan Project as part of the Special Engineer Detachment. At Los Alamos, he met Professor Robert Williams, who later recruited him to teach at the University of Washington. As a graduate student at Cornell after World War II, Davisson built a cosmic ray machine that would do everything but write a grad student's thesis. He acquired a huge magnet from Navy surplus, built a cloud chamber and a set of Geiger counters and designed a universal-focus camera to record cosmic ray events. Then he designed and built an early electronic computer to record and sort the events according to energy, mass, charge, direction and frequency. Davisson received great praise from the Cornell faculty, after he mounted his machine in a trailer that could be towed up in the mountains or lowered into abandoned mines. With such success, Davisson went on to the University of Washington without a PhD. Davisson's passion as a graduate student was to find unusual ways to solve assigned problems. He resorted to the method taught in class only as a last resort. Davisson was a member of the University of Washington's team which designed a system for detecting subatomic particles known as muons. After the U.S. government pulled the funding on the Superconducting Super Collider project, the team was recruited by CERN to help build part of the muon detector of the ATLAS experiment in the Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator, in which Davisson took part in, e.g., creating tools to test the detector tubes and as a liaison between the University of Washington's team and the rest of the collaborating group. Davisson retired for six weeks out of every year of his life to the Davisson family cottage in the tiny town of Brooklin, Maine, where he enjoyed a quiet retreat messing about in boats and living by the water. In the sixties, Davisson was a member of a \\"poor man's\\" artistic and Bohemian waterfront community in Seattle, Washington, where he and his wife enjoyed raising their infant son on a houseboat, a time Davisson described as one of the happiest in his life. Among his proudest achievements was his criminal record, a single charge of illegal moorage of his sailboat the No Hurry on the water's edge of the University of Washington campus. A close friend of Washington State's first female governor, the late Dixy Lee Ray, a Democrat, he was a frequent guest at her Fox Island home. He was one of the founders of Seattle's Pacific Science Center, which continues, decades later, to bring the knowledge and fun of science to children and young people. Among his many outside interests, Davisson was a photographer, most famous for his series of black-and-white studies of the eyes of insects, which helped him in his work with optics. He enjoyed children's literature and fine, simple food. He read widely in the sciences and politics, often devouring several journals, magazines and newspapers in an evening while simultaneously keeping a constant running log of the physics equations in his head on notebook after notebook of graph paper. Responsible for many physics discoveries, he nevertheless did not publish, modestly claiming that someone else would \\"figure it out eventually\\". He was a brilliant and funny raconteur and philosopher, regularly gathering a small entourage to his favorite public house, The Big Time Brewery on University Way N.E., also in Seattle, where he held the dual honor of being the very first and best customer and the first taster of new products. A plaque is now placed there in his honor. Davisson retired in 2000, at the age of 77. Davisson was married for forty years to Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" Davisson, a retired Psychiatric Social Worker from whom he separated after fourteen years but with whom he maintained close, personal contact until his death. They have one son, Gordon Owen Davisson, a successful software engineer and businessman. He was succeeded in death as well by his Sister, Elizabeth Dixon Davisson.  Quotations  :\\"There are no physicists in the hottest parts of Hell, because the existence of a 'hottest part' implies a temperature difference, and any marginally competent physicist would immediately use this to run a heat engine and make some other part of Hell comfortably cool. This is obviously impossible.\\" also: :\\"A physicist should have both a Wife and a Mistress and furthermore each should be aware of the other.

She met Wyatt in 1881 in the frontier boom town of Tombstone, Arizona Territory, when she was living with Johnny Behan, sheriff of Cochise County, Arizona. Josephine was born in New York to a Prussian Jewish family; her father was a baker. They moved to San Francisco, where Josephine attended dance school as a girl. When her father had difficulty finding work, the family moved in with her older sister and brother-in-law in a working-class tenement. Josephine ran away, possibly as early as age 14, and traveled to Arizona, where she said she went looking for \\"adventure\\". Much of her life from about 1874 to 1882 when she lived in the Arizona Territory is uncertain; she worked hard to keep this period of her life private, even threatening legal action against writers and movie producers. She may have arrived in Prescott, Arizona as early as 1874. The book I Married Wyatt Earp (1967), based on a manuscript allegedly written in part by her, describes events she witnessed in Arizona that occurred before 1879, the year she claimed at other times to have first arrived in Tombstone. There is some evidence that she lived from 1874 to 1876 in Prescott and Tip Top, Arizona Territory under the assumed name of Sadie Mansfield, who was a prostitute, before becoming ill and returning to San Francisco. The name Sadie Mansfield was also recorded in Tombstone. Researchers have found that the two names share extremely similar characteristics and circumstances. Later in life Josephine described her first years in Arizona as \\"a bad dream.\\" What is known for certain is that she traveled to Tombstone using the name Josephine Marcus in October 1880. She wrote that she met Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan when she was 17 and he was 33. He promised to marry her and she joined him in Tombstone. He reneged but persuaded her to stay. Behan was sympathetic to ranchers and certain outlaw Cowboys, who were at odds with Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp and his brothers, Wyatt and Morgan. Josephine left Behan in 1881, before the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, during which Wyatt and his brothers killed three Cochise County Cowboys. She went to San Francisco in March 1882 and was joined that fall by Wyatt, with whom she remained in a common-law marriage for 46 years until his death. Josephine and Wyatt moved throughout their life, from one boomtown to another, until they finally bought a cottage in the Sonoran Desert town of Vidal, California on the Colorado River, where they spent the cooler seasons. In the summer they retreated to Los Angeles, where Wyatt struck up relationships with some of the early cowboy actors, including William S. Hart and Tom Mix. The facts about Josephine Earp and her relationship to Wyatt were relatively unknown until amateur Earp historian Glenn Boyer published the book, I Married Wyatt Earp. Boyer's book was considered a factual memoir, and cited by scholars, studied in classrooms, and used as a source by filmmakers for 32 years. In 1998, reporters and scholars found that Boyer could not document many of the facts he wrote about Josephine's time in Tombstone. Some critics described the book as a fraud and a hoax, and the University of Arizona withdrew the book from its catalog.  Early life  Josephine Sarah Marcus was born in 1861 in New York City, the second of three children of immigrants Carl-Hyman Marcuse (later Henry Marcus) and Sophie Lewis. The Lewis family was Jewish, and came from the Posen region in Prussia, current-day Poland, around 1850. Sophie was a widow with a 3-year- old daughter, Rebecca Levy, when she married Marcuse, who was eight years younger than she. Sophie and Carl had three children together: Nathan (born August 12, 1857), Josephine, and Henrietta (born July 10, 1864). = Move to San Francisco = Josephine's father Henry was a baker. He struggled to make a living in New York City and read about the growing city of San Francisco. Henry moved the family to San Francisco in 1868 when Josephine was 7. They traveled via ship to Panama, went over the Isthmus of Panama, and caught a steamship to San Francisco. They arrived while the city was recovering from the disastrous earthquake of October 21, 1868. Upon their arrival, her father found a highly stratified Jewish community. On the inside were the German Jews and on the outside were the Polish Jews. The German Jews were usually more affluent, were better educated, and spoke German, while the Polish Jews, who spoke Yiddish, were typically peddlers and much more religious. Henry found work as a baker. By 1870, San Francisco was riding on the coattails of the still expanding economic boom caused by the mining of silver from the Comstock Lode. San Francisco's population had boomed to 149,473, and housing was in short supply. Apartment buildings were crowded and large homes were converted into rooming houses. Money flowed from Nevada through San Francisco, and for a while the Marcus family prospered. Later that year, Josephine's half-sister Rebecca Levy married Aaron Wiener, an insurance salesman born in Prussia, as her parents were. = Living conditions = As an adult, Josephine claimed her father was German and ran a prosperous mercantile business. Henry Marcus initially made enough money to send Josephine and her sister Hattie to music and dance classes at McCarty's Dancing Academy, a family-owned business on Eddy St. that taught both children and adults. In I Married Wyatt Earp, author Glen Boyer states that Josephine took dance lessons and had a maid. He wrote (in her voice), \\"Hattie and I attended the McCarthy Dancing Academy for children on Howard Street (Polk and Pacific). Eugenia and Lottie McCarthy taught us to dance the Highland Fling, the Sailor's Hornpipe, and ballroom dancing.\\" During 1874, when Josephine was 13, production of gold and silver from the Comstock Lode had fed a feverish stock market, leading to a great deal of speculation. When the Comstock Lode production began to fade, San Francisco suffered. Her father Henry‚Äôs earnings as a baker fell. The family was forced to move in with Josephine's older sister Rebecca and her husband Aaron \\"south of the slot\\" (south of Market Street) at 138 Perry Street between 3rd and 2nd at Harrison in a tenement on the flatlands. It was a working- class, ethnically mixed neighborhood, where smoke from factory chimneys filled the air. The 1880 census places the family in the 9th Ward, between San Francisco Bay, Channel, Harrison and Seventh streets. In early 1880, Henry was living with his son-in-law Aaron, who was employed as a bookkeeper. = Youth = As a girl, Josephine loved going to the theater. \\"There was far too much excitement in the air to remain a child.\\" She apparently resented treatment by her teachers in the San Francisco schools, describing them as \\"inconsistent of a tolerant and gay populous acting as merciless and self-righteous as a New England village in bringing up its children.\\" She described the harsh discipline meted out, including the \\"sting of rattan\\" and \\"being slapped for tardiness\\". Josephine said that she matured early and developed large breasts.  Mixing fact and fiction  Throughout her later life, Josephine worked hard to manage what the press and public knew about her and Wyatt's life in Arizona. Josephine told Earp's biographers and others that Earp didn't drink, never owned gambling saloons, and that he didn't offer prostitutes upstairs, when all have been documented. When Frank Waters was writing Tombstone Travesty, originally published in 1934, he returned from a research trip to Tombstone to learn that Josephine Earp had visited his mother and sister and threatened court action to prevent him from publishing the book. Waters' work was later found to be critically flawed, \\"based upon prevarications, character assassinations, and the psychological battleground that was the brilliant, narcissistic mind of its author.\\" In the course of writing Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal (1931), Stuart Lake learned that Josephine had lived with Johnny Behan in Tombstone and other aspects of Josephine's life that she wanted to keep private. Josephine and Wyatt went to great lengths to keep her name out of Lake's book, and she threatened litigation to keep it that way. At one point in their contentious relationship, Josephine described Lake's book as made up of \\"outright lies\\". After Wyatt died in 1929, Josephine traveled to Boston, Massachusetts to try to persuade the publisher to stop the release of the book. Although the biography became a bestseller, it was later strongly criticized for fictionalizing Earp's life and was found to be markedly inaccurate. During the later years of her life, in addition to burnishing the life and legend of husband Wyatt Earp, \\"she scripted a history of make believe to hide a number of things of which she was not terribly proud.\\" = Concealed Wyatt's former wife = As late as 1936, Josephine took legal action to suppress certain details of her and Wyatt's life in Tombstone. Josephine worked hard to conceal Wyatt's prior relationship to his common-law wife and former prostitute Mattie Blaylock, with whom Wyatt was living when Josephine first met him. While Blaylock was living with Earp, she suffered from severe headaches and became addicted to laudanum, an opiate-based pain reliever widely available at the time. After Earp left Tombstone and Blaylock, she waited in Colton, California to hear from him, but he never contacted her. She met a gambler from Arizona who asked her to marry him. She asked Wyatt for a divorce, but Wyatt didn't believe in divorce and refused. She ran away with the gambler anyway, who later abandoned her in Arizona. Mattie resumed life as a prostitute and committed \\"suicide by opium poisoning\\" on July 3, 1888. = Evasive about Tombstone history = The facts about Josephine's life in the Arizona Territory and in Tombstone have been obscured by her legal and personal efforts to keep that period private. Josephine's own story offers a conflicting account of when she first reached Arizona. Her confusing recollection of events show how easily Josephine mixed fact and fiction. After Wyatt's death, Josephine collaborated with two of her husband's cousins, Mabel Earp Cason and her sister Vinolia Earp Ackerman, to document her life. The cousins recorded events in her later life, but they found Josephine evasive about the timing and nature of events during her time in the Arizona Territory and Tombstone. She would not even talk about the key events of 1881-82, their key years in Tombstone. The most she would say is that she returned to the Arizona Territory in 1881 and joined Johnny Behan in Tombstone. She said that she had believed Behan was planning to marry her, but he kept putting it off, and she grew disillusioned. Based on the story she told the Earp cousins, when correlated with other sources, Josephine may have left her parents‚Äô home in San Francisco for Prescott, Arizona, as early as October 1874, when she was 13 or 14 years old, not 1879 as she told everyone later on. Cason says she and her sister \\"finally abandoned work on the manuscript because she [Josie] would not clear up the Tombstone sequence where it pertained to her and Wyatt.\\" = Hidden personal past = In addition to Josephine's concealing Wyatt's past relationship with Blaylock, modern researchers think she may also have been concealing her own past as a \\"sporting lady\\" or prostitute. When Stuart Lake was researching his book Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal he heard stories about Sadie's personal history. He didn't include them in the book, but he did write about them in letters during 1929. Bat Masterson, a friend of Wyatt Earp's who was in Tombstone from February to April 1881, described her to Stuart Lake as \\"an incredible beauty\\" and as the \\"belle of the honkytonks, the prettiest dame in three hundred or so of her kind.\\" Honkytonk bars in that era often had a reputation as places for prostitution. and his choice of language (\\"three hundred or so of her kind\\") may have referred to Josephine's work as a prostitute. Other researchers have questioned what she did prior to 1883. A town like Tombstone, full of single men, attracted women who sought adventure with little concern for what others might think. Josephine always sought excitement in her life. In the book I Married Wyatt Earp (1967), based on a manuscript which she purportedly wrote, author Glenn Boyer quotes her as saying, \\"I liked the traveling sort of man... better than the kind that sat back in one town all his life and wrote down little rows of figures all day or hustled dry goods or groceries and that sort of thing... My blood demanded excitement, variety and change.\\" Men in Tombstone outnumbered women nine to one, and the miners were eager to pay substantial fees to women who would cook their meals, provide rooms, wash their clothes, and provide sexual services. Many madams and prostitutes had more control of their lives and greater independence than \\"respectable\\" women, who often ostracized them. Married women of the era were expected to avoid working outside the home, or risk being considered \\"public women,\\" a euphemism for prostitute. A few women of the era chose to remain single as a means to maintain their independence from men, and Josephine was among them. The type of work available to unmarried women without means in that era was as waitresses, laundresses, seamstresses, or other dull work which Josephine avoided. Some women in Tombstone operated restaurants, boarding-houses, and apparel and millinery shops, and a few ran some of the dry goods stores. Many wives of the prosperous mining engineers, merchants, and business owners lived in better class cities where they didn't have to contend with being confused for a prostitute. Josephine's life on the frontier and possibly as a prostitute allowed her greater independence. She likely enjoyed the social life and independence that accompanied her role. As an unmarried woman in frontier Tombstone, vastly outnumbered by men, she was likely regarded by some as a prostitute, regardless of her true status.  Runs away  In a remarkable set of coincidences, the known life of Josephine Sadie Marcus overlapped the life of an otherwise unknown prostitute named Sadie Mansfield. Josie attended the Powell Street Primary School on Powell St. between Clay and Washington in San Francisco. One block away on the 1000 block of Clay Street in a neighborhood known for prostitution was a brothel, owned by Hattie Wells. In 1879, five prostitutes lived there. Josephine had to walk past the brothel every day on her way to school. To her the women appeared not as \\"soiled doves\\" but nicely dressed women living a life of leisure. Wells also owned a brothel in Prescott, Arizona. In I Married Wyatt Earp, Josephine wrote that one day, \\"I left my home one morning, carrying my books just as though I was going to school as usual.\\" She said that at the age of 18, she ran away with two friends, Dora Hirsch, daughter of her music teacher, and a girl named Agnes, who had a role in Pauline Markham troupe's production of H.M.S. Pinafore in San Francisco. Author Sherry Monahan questions why an 18-year-old woman would be carrying books to school and find it necessary to \\"run away.\\" = First arrival in Arizona = Pauline Markham, c. 1860s. Josephine said she joined Markham's theater troupe in 1879 in San Francisco before it toured to Arizona, but no record of Josephine or Sadie Marcus as a member of the group has been found. In the Cason manuscript, which was in part the basis for the book I Married Wyatt Earp, Josephine says she and her friend Dora joined the Pauline Markham Theater Company in 1879, when it visited San Francisco on its Western tour. Markham already had a national reputation as a burlesque dancer and songstress. She often appeared on stage and in publicity photos wearing a corset and pink tights: shocking attire for the 1870s. Josephine wrote that Dora was hired as a singer, and she was hired as a dancer. Josie said the two of them sailed with the other six members of the Pauline Markham troupe from San Francisco to Santa Barbara, where they stayed for a few days, performing in San Bernardino before leaving for Prescott, Arizona Territory, by stagecoach. Josephine said the girls arrived with the troupe in Tombstone on December 1, 1879 for a one-week engagement. This was the same date that Wyatt Earp and his brothers arrived. After a week in Tombstone, the Markham troupe finished their engagement and headed north to Prescott. They performed H.M.S. Pinafore more than a dozen times from December 24, 1879 through February 20, 1880. Josephine said she left the acting troupe in February 1880, just after the Markham troupe ended its initial run of performances in Prescott. Author Roger Ray thoroughly researched Josephine's story about joining the theater company and found many inconsistencies. The Markham troupe is documented as leaving San Francisco on board the Southern Pacific Railroad, not a ship nor a stagecoach, in October 1879 for Casa Grande, Arizona, the end of the line. Josephine or Sadie Marcus‚Äôs name was never included among those on the Markham troupe‚Äôs rolls in 1879. The Yuma Arizona Sentinel reported on October 25, 1879, \\"Tuesday arrived a Pinafore Company for Tucson, composed of Misses Pauline Markham, Mary Bell, Belle Howard, and Mrs. Pring, and Messrs. Borabeck and McMahon.\\" From Yuma, the troupe took a stagecoach to Tucson, not Prescott. Ray says that Josephine didn't have a friend named Dora Hirsch. Her real name was Leah Hirschberg, whose mother was a music teacher. This family lived only a few blocks from where Josephine lived with her family. But Leah never left San Francisco with Josephine. She enjoyed some brief success as a juvenile actress on the San Francisco stage during the 1870s. Professor Pat Ryan stated that Josephine or Sadie may have used the stage name May Bell as a member of the Markham stage group. On October 21, 1879, the Los Angeles Herald reported that May Bell was among members of the Markham troupe. But, no other corroborating evidence has been found supporting the thesis that Josephine used May Bell as a stage name, and she never claimed so. = Links to prostitute Sadie Mansfield = Josephine began using the name Sadie after she arrived in Arizona. Sadie was a well-known nickname for Sarah, Josie's middle name, and it was common for prostitutes of that time period to change their first name. In November 1874, a woman named Sadie Mansfield took a stagecoach from San Francisco to Prescott along with several prostitutes working for Madame Hattie Wells. The group included a black woman named Julia Barton. (Josephine in her own account said that she brought her maid, a black woman named Julia, with her. She also told the Earp cousins that Pauline Markham had a maid named Julia.) On October 20, 1875, the Arizona Weekly Miner of Prescott, Arizona noted that among the passengers en route from San Francisco were \\"Miss Saddie Mansfield... and Mrs. Julia Barton, a servant.\\" Prostitution wasn't illegal in the territory as long as the women paid their licensing fees. Prominent men were however expected to be discreet. = Meets Johnny Behan = Johnny Behan in 1871. Josephine said he was \\"young and darkly handsome, with merry black eyes and an engaging smile.\\" Josephine told others that when she and her friend Dora arrived in Arizona she learned that \\"some renegade Yuma-Apaches had escaped from the reservation to which they had been consigned and had returned to their old haunts on the war-path.\\" She wrote that the famous Indian fighter Al Sieber was tracking the escaped Apache. She said that Sieber and his scouts led her stagecoach and its passengers to a nearby adobe ranch house. The group spent 10 days sleeping on the floor. Josephine first met John \\"Johnny\\" Harris Behan at the ranch house, who she described as, \\"young and darkly handsome, with merry black eyes and an engaging smile. My heart was stirred by his attentions in what were very romantic circumstances. It was a diversion from my homesickness though I cannot say I was in love with him.... I am under the impression that he was a deputy sheriff engaged on some official errand.\\" If as Josephine stated she traveled with Markham's troupe from San Francisco in December 1879, there are no contemporary accounts of the trip being interrupted by Indians. Behan married 17-year-old Victoria Zaff in March 1869 in San Francisco, her step-father's home town. She was the step-daughter of Yavapai County Sheriff John P. Bourke. The couple moved back to Prescott, Arizona Territory, where John had been working, and four months later, on June 15, 1869, she had her first child, Henrietta. Behan was on the surface an upstanding citizen, married with a child, but he also frequented brothels. During 1871‚Äì73, Behan succeeded his father-in-law Bourke as Yavapai County Sheriff. On September 28, 1874, Behan was nominated at the Democratic convention to stand for re-election. He began campaigning and the Prescott Miner reported on October 6, 1874, that \\"J.H. Behan left on an 'electioneering' tour toward Black Canyon, Wickenburg and other places\\" north and west of present-day Phoenix. Later that same month, on October 24, 1874, the Arizona Miner reported, \\"Al Zieber, Sergeant Stauffer and a mixed command of white and red soldiers are in the hills of Verde looking for some erring Apaches, whom they will be apt to find.\\" Three days later, Sieber and Sgt. Rudolph Stauffer found the Apaches that had escaped the reservation at Cave Creek and fought them. The area in which Behan campaigned was also near Cave Creek, where Al Sieber was looking for Indians. Behan was gone for 35 days, returning to Prescott on November 11, 1874, where he lost the election. The first Yavapai County Courthouse and Jail, a wood frame structure, was on North Cortez Street in Prescott. The events that Josephine \\"Sadie\\" Marcus claimed took place when she was 18 years old in 1879 don't correlate with known facts, but do closely correspond to the events in 14 year old Sadie Mansfield's journey to Prescott in 1874. = Sadie Mansfield in Arizona = Prescott had 668 residents in 1870. In 1874, 14-year-old Sadie Mansfield worked under the watchful eye of Madam Josie Roland as a prostitute in a brothel on Granite Street, between Gurley and Alarcon streets, and near the Yavapai County Courthouse where Sheriff Behan worked. Neighbors in Prescott witnessed Behan visiting the \\"house of ill fame\\" on Granite Street on several occasions during December 1874. He had a \\"relationship with\\" Sadie Mansfield, likely the same girl who had traveled with Hattie Wells' prostitutes from San Francisco. On February 6, 1875, criminal charges were filed against Sadie Mansfield for petty larceny, accusing her of stealing two German silver spoons worth $126.00. The charges against her reported that \\"one set of German table spoons were stolen from the store of H. Asher and Company in the village of Prescott, Yavapai, A.T.\\" Sheriff Ed Burnes searched Mansfield's residence and confiscated the spoons. The case was tried the same day with only one witness for the defense, Jennie Andrews. The nine-man jury found her not guilty. The Weekly Arizona Miner of Prescott reported on February 5, 1875, that Sadie Mansfield won a prize in the \\"Grand New Year Gift Enterprise\\". The paper also reported on April 9, 1875, that a letter was waiting for her in the post office. On May 22, 1875, Behan's wife Victoria filed for divorce. She took the unusual step of asserting in her divorce petition that Behan \\"at divers times and places openly and notoriously visited houses of ill-fame and prostitution at said town of Prescott.\\" Victoria cited liaisons with several woman, but specifically mentioned a \\"Sadie or Sada Mansfield\\", a 14-year-old \\"woman of prostitution and ill-fame\\" as co-respondent in the divorce action. The divorce also cited Behan's threats of violence and unrelenting verbal abuse. Behan claimed their daughter Henrietta wasn't his, and a request for support for Henrietta was stricken from the divorce petition. Tip Top, Arizona Territory, circa 1888 Behan and his wife were divorced in less than a month, in June 1875. Behan moved for a time to the northwest Arizona Territory, where he served as the Mohave County Recorder in 1877. He lost an election for Mohave County deputy sheriff in Gillet in 1879, but was elected as Mohave's representative to the Tenth Territorial Legislature. In the summer of 1879 he moved back to Prescott, the territorial capital. He opened a small business catering to miners and joined a few posses pursuing bandits. The Weekly Journal-Miner reported in October 1879 that Behan was planning on opening a business in the silver mining boom town of Tip Top in central Arizona. In November 1879, Johnny Behan opened his new saloon for business. While the town already had five saloons with five courtesans, Johnny's new saloon had none. During the 1880 census in Tip Top, Behan's occupation was given as saloon keeper. Nineteen-year-old Sadie Mansfield, the same person his former wife Victoria had named in their divorce five years earlier, was also living in Tip Top. Her occupation was \\"Courtesan\\". In retelling her life story, Josephine Marcus retold many elements of her experience that corroborated facts in Sadie Mansfield's history. These facts may explain why Josephine later thought of this time in her life as \\"a bad dream.\\" She said, \\"the whole experience recurs to my memory as a bad dream and I remember little of its details. I can remember shedding many tears in out-of the way-corners. I thought constantly of my mother and how great must be her grief and worry over me. In my confusion, I could see no way out of the tragic mess.\\" = Returns to San Francisco = In her Cason manuscript, Josephine or Sadie wrote that she and Dora were homesick and returned to San Francisco with Sieber's help. If Sieber helped her, the only time period that fits Josephine's story is when Sieber was in the Prescott area at Camp Verde from 1873 to 1875. Josephine said that Sieber, who was German and may have recognized Josephine's German accent, guessed her situation and sent a telegram from Fort Whipple to her brother-in- law Aaron Weiner. She said Weiner used a connection he had in Prescott to help Josephine get home. In January 1876, Josephine or Sadie left Prescott, stopped at a Los Angeles hotel, and returned to San Francisco before March 6. Josephine told the Earp cousins that she returned to San Francisco before the grand opening of Lucky Baldwin's luxury Baldwin Hotel and Theater on the northeast corner of Powell and Market St., which opened on March 6, 1876. The opening date of the Baldwin Hotel is much earlier than the date Josephine said she left for Arizona with the Pauline Markham Troupe in 1879. Josephine wrote much later that her family wanted to keep her \\"escapades from the public.\\" In her memoirs she wrote, \\"the younger children (niece and nephew), and our friends were told that I had gone away for a visit. Mrs. Hirsch, because of Dora‚Äôs part in it was as anxious as my people (family), to keep it a secret. The memory of it has been a source of humiliation and regret to me in all the years since that time and I have never until now disclosed it to anyone besides my husband (Wyatt).\\" She added, \\"The fear and the excitement, the weeks of exhausting travel, chagrin over my own foolishness, all together proved too much for my strength. I developed St. Vitus Dance and was unable to attend school very much again. After a time however I very much improved in health so that within two years after my experience I was once more a normal healthy girl.\\" If Josephine, as she said, left San Francisco at age 18, it's unclear why she would still be attending school upon her return two years later. Like cerebral meningitis, St. Vitus Dance is a form of a streptococcus infection. The symptoms of St. Vitus Dance and meningitis are somewhat different, but both can be contracted from the same strain of bacteria through saliva. Both of Behan's children, Henrietta and Albert, were ill with meningitis around 1877, and in July of that year, Henrietta died from the disease. = Behan proposes = In February or March 1879: The Prescott Weekly Journal-Miner reported that John Behan was visiting San Francisco. Josephine said Behan asked her to marry him and persuaded her parents to approve their engagement. She said Behan told her family that he could not leave his livery stable business long enough for a wedding in San Francisco. Some modern researchers question the likelihood that her father, a Reform Jew, would approve his daughter's union with Behan, a man 14 years older than his daughter, an unemployed office-seeker, Gentile, and divorced father. Later in life, Josephine was not a practicing Jew and did not seem to care whether her partners were Jewish. Josephine thought Johnny‚Äôs marriage proposal was a good excuse to leave home again. She wrote, \\"life was dull for me in San Francisco. In spite of my bad experience of a few years ago the call to adventure still stirred my blood.\\" Considering that Josephine reported in later life at having first arrived with the Markham Troupe on December 1, 1879, and that Josephine joined Behan in Tombstone that same year, her reference to \\"my bad experience of a few years ago\\" means she must have been in Arizona for some time before 1879. = Sadie in Arizona and San Francisco = Sadie Mansfield left Gillete, near Tip Top, and arrived in Phoenix on February 13, 1880. During the same week, Behan registered at the Bank Exchange Hotel in Phoenix, and on March 5 the Prescott Weekly Journal-Miner reported that Sadie had returned to Gillette from Phoenix on March 2. On June 2, 1880, the U.S. census had recorded Sadie Mansfield, whose occupation was \\"courtesan\\", as living in Tip Top. On June 1 or 2, 1880, William V. Carroll, the census enumerator for the 9th ward in San Francisco, visited the Marcus home. He lived about two blocks from the family, so he likely already knew the family. He recorded Josephine as a member of the Marcus household, information that may have been offered by her parents. But Josephine said that her parents hid her activities, and they may have been covering for her when the census taker appeared on their doorstep. In a set of extraordinary coincidences, Sadie Mansfield and Sadie Marcus had very similar names and initials and were known by their friends as \\"Sadie.\\" Both made a stagecoach journey from San Francisco to Prescott, Arizona Territory; both traveled with a black woman named Julia; both were sexual partners with Behan; both were 19 years old, born in New York City, and had parents from Germany. The only difference noted in the 1880 census is their occupation: Sadie in San Francisco is listed as \\"At home\\", while Sadie in Tip Top is recorded as a \\"Courtesan\\". (In the 1920 census, Sadie reported to the census taker that her family was from Hamburg, Germany, bordering Prussia.)  Move to Tombstone  In September 1880, Behan and Sadie left Tip Top for Tombstone. Soon after they arrived, Behan's ex-wife sent their eight-year-old son Albert to live with him. In reconstructing her life story, Josephine said years later that she actually lived with Kitty Jones and her husband, a lawyer, while working as a housekeeper for Behan. Boyer and other modern researchers argue that she actually lived with Behan. In Josephine's version of her life story, she left San Francisco to join Behan to Tombstone in October 1880, and was hoping he would fulfill his promises to marry her. When he delayed, she was ready to leave him. Josephine is quoted in I Married Wyatt Earp that she received a letter and $300 from her father, urging her to return to San Francisco. The money was to cover her return trip, and it was ten times what she needed for the fare, and there is no record of him having sent the money to her. Rather than leave Tombstone, Josephine later wrote that Behan convinced her to use the money to build a house for them and continued their relationship. At the time, her parents, her sister Henrietta, and her brother Nathan were all living in a lower-class neighborhood south of Market Street in San Francisco with their daughter, her husband, their four children, and a boarder. Her father worked as a baker. It is unlikely that he was a \\"wealthy German merchant\\" as she described him. While there are no records that her father sent her money, researchers have located records of money orders totaling $50 sent by Josephine to her family in San Francisco. One of these was sent after she ended her relationship with Johnny Behan, indicating that she was earning money as a single woman. = Kicks Behan out = In early 1881, Josephine returned to Tombstone after a trip to San Francisco. One version of the story is that she had taken Behan's son Albert, who was hearing impaired, to San Francisco for treatment. Upon their return, they arrived late in the evening and a day earlier than expected, at the house built with her father's money. Finding Behan in bed with the wife of a friend of theirs, she kicked him out. = Early relationship with Wyatt Earp = Wyatt Earp at about age 39. How and when she and Wyatt Earp began their relationship is unknown. Tombstone diarist George W. Parsons never mentioned seeing Wyatt and Josephine together and neither did John Clum in his memoirs. While there are no contemporary records in Tombstone of a relationship between them, they certainly knew each other, as Behan and Earp both had offices above the Crystal Palace Saloon. In his book, The Tombstone Travesty (later republished as The Earp Brothers of Tombstone), Frank Waters quotes Virgil Earp's wife, Allie, as saying that \\"Sadie's charms were undeniable. She had a small, trim body and a meneo of the hips that kept her full, flounced skirts bouncing. Sadie was an attractive woman, with thick, dark hair, vivid black eyes, and was well-endowed. Some modern writers believe that Wyatt Earp moved in with Josephine after she kicked Behan out. But, in April 1881, less than eight months after Behan and Sadie built the house, she rented it to Dr. George Emory Goodfellow. At some point during August and September, Sadie and Wyatt may have become friends and perhaps more seriously involved. Writer Alan Barra suggests that Behan and Earp knew of their mutual attraction to the same woman before the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, which may have contributed to their animosity. Author Stuart Lake wrote in a letter that \\"Johnny Behan's girl\\" was ‚Äúthe key to the whole yarn of Tombstone‚Äù. A letter written by former New Mexico Territory Governor Miguel Otero appears to indicate that Earp had strong feelings for Josephine shortly after leaving Tombstone in April 1882. Following the Earp Vendetta Ride, the Earp posse went to Albuquerque, New Mexico for two weeks. While there, Wyatt stayed with prominent businessman Henry N. Jaffa, who was also president of New Albuquerque‚Äôs Board of Trade. Jaffa was also Jewish. Wyatt and Holliday had been fast friends since Holliday saved Earp's life in Dodge City during 1878. From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) During their stay in Albuquerque, the two men ate at The Retreat Restaurant owned by \\"Fat Charlie\\". Otero wrote in his letter, \\"Holiday said something about Earp becoming 'a damn Jew-boy.' Earp became angry and left‚Ä¶. [Henry] Jaffa told me later that Earp‚Äôs woman was a Jewess. Earp did mezuzah when entering the house.\\" Earp's anger at Holliday's ethnic slur may indicate that his feelings for Josephine was more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information in the letter is compelling because at the time it was written in the 1940s, the relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus while living in Tombstone was virtually unknown. The only way Otero could write about these things was if he had a personal relationship with some of the individuals involved. The Earp party split up in Albuquerque, and Holliday and Dan Tipton rode on to Pueblo, while the rest of the group headed for Gunnison. = Names used in Tombstone = In June 1881, Sadie sent a postal money order to her mother using the name Josephine Behan, and Wyatt Earp was still living with his common-law wife Mattie Blaylock. The next month, in July 1881, Josephine Behan was reported to be leaving Tombstone by stage. But in August a Tombstone newspaper reported a letter waiting at the post office for Sadie Mansfield. Sadie was apparently no longer claiming to be Behan's wife. = Presence after gunfight = Josephine is quoted in I Married Wyatt Earp as saying that on October 26, 1881, the day of the shootout at the O.K. Corral, she was at her home when she heard the sound of gunfire. Running into town in the direction of the shots, Josephine was relieved to see that Wyatt was uninjured. Other researchers and writers aren't even sure she was in town that day. No contemporary accounts place her at the scene of the gunfight afterward. After the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Ike Clanton filed murder charges against the Earps and Doc Holliday. During a month-long preliminary hearing, Judge Wells Spicer heard testimony from a large number of witnesses. The Tombstone Epitaph reported on November 11, 1881 that \\"S. Mansfield\\" from San Francisco had passed Colton, California (where Wyatt Earp's parents lived) en route to Arizona, a few days before Wyatt's testimony at the Spicer hearing. = Leaves Tombstone = During the next few months, until April 1882, Sadie Mansfield is recorded in various newspapers as traveling back and forth between Tombstone and San Francisco several times. The Epitaph reported on February 27, 1882 that S. Mansfield of Tombstone was returning from the west with other passengers, passing through Colton, California. In March 1882, Sadie sent a postal money order to her mother, Mrs. H. Marcus, in San Francisco. She didn't use either Marcus or Behan as her name, but asked a friend to send the postal order for her. Sadie, traveling as either Mrs. J. C. Earp or Mrs. Wyatt Earp, left Tombstone for her family in San Francisco via Los Angeles on March 25, 1882. This was one week after Morgan Earp was assassinated and five days after Wyatt set out in pursuit of those he believed responsible. After the Earp Vendetta Ride ended in April 1882, Wyatt left Arizona for Colorado. Earp's former wife, Mattie Blaylock traveled with other Earp family members in April 1882, to Colton, California, waiting for Wyatt to telegraph her and invite her to join him. Wyatt never sent for her and she moved to Pinal, Arizona, where she resumed life as a prostitute, eventually committing suicide by taking an overdose of laudanum. Sadie Mansfield reappeared in Tombstone when she was noted in the July 1882 Tombstone census, but Josephine Marcus and Josephine Behan were not. Sadie and John Behan lived at different addresses.  Life after Tombstone  Josephine's life after Tombstone and with Wyatt Earp is not well known, although it isn't as obscured by stories of her life in Tombstone that she told to hide facts. The San Diego Union printed a report from the San Francisco Call on July 9, 1882 that Virgil Earp was in San Francisco (receiving treatment for his shattered arm) and that Wyatt was expected to arrive there that day. Following Wyatt's return to San Francisco, Josephine began using the name of \\"Josephine Earp\\". Wyatt took a job managing a horse stable in Santa Rosa. Earp developed a reputation as a sportsman as well as a gambler. He was reputed to own a six-horse stable in San Francisco, although it was learned later that the horses were leased. At Santa Rosa, Earp personally competed in and won a harness race. The Sacramento Daily Record reported on October 20, 1882, that Virgil had arrived in town from Tombstone to greet his brother Wyatt arriving from the east, although Virgil was living in Colton at the time. = Mining camps and boom towns = In early 1883, Josephine‚Äîor Sadie as Wyatt called her‚Äîand Wyatt left San Francisco for Gunnison, Colorado, where Earp ran a Faro bank until he received a request in April for assistance from Luke Short in Dodge City. In December 1883, they visited Galveston, Texas, and in March 1884 they were in Salt Lake City. Josephine and Wyatt traveled through various western states hunting for gold and silver mining they could invest in. In 1884, Wyatt and his wife Josie, his brothers Warren and James, and James' wife Bessie arrived in Eagle City, Idaho, another new boomtown that was created as a result of the discovery of gold, silver, and lead in the Coeur d'Alene area. (It's now a ghost town in Shoshone County). Wyatt followed the crowd looking for gold in the Murray-Eagle mining district and paid $2,250 for a diameter white circus, in which they opened a dance hall and saloon called The White Elephant. After the Coeur d'Alene mining venture died out, Earp and Josie briefly went to El Paso, Texas before moving in 1887 to San Diego where the railroad was about to arrive and a real estate boom was underway. They stayed for about four years, living most of the time in the Brooklyn Hotel. Earp speculated in San Diego's booming real estate market. Between 1887 and around 1896 he bought four saloons and gambling halls, one on Fourth Street and two near Sixth and E, all in the \\"respectable\\" part of town. The Earps moved back to San Francisco in 1891 so Josie could be closer to her family. Earp developed a reputation as a sportsman as well as a gambler. He held onto his San Diego properties but their value fell, but he could not pay the taxes and was forced to sell the lots. He continued to race horses, but by 1896 he could no longer afford to own horses, but raced them on behalf of the owner of a horse stable in Santa Rosa that he managed for her. = Marriage to Wyatt = Josephine wrote in I Married Wyatt Earp that she and Wyatt were married in 1892 offshore by the captain of Lucky Baldwin's yacht. Raymond Nez wrote that his grandparents witnessed their marriage off the California coast. No public record of their marriage has ever been found. Wyatt and Josie never had any children. Josie had two miscarriages during her life and was apparently unable to have children. She maintained a relationship with Johnny Behan's son, Albert Price Behan, whom she had grown to love as her own son. They moved frequently, even when living in the same town. From 1891 to 1896, the Earps lived in at least four different locations in San Francisco: 145 Ellis St., 720 McAllister St., 514A Seventh Ave. and 1004 Golden Gate Ave. After moving to southern California in about 1903, they also lived in several different locations. According to many who knew them, their relationship was often stormy. Wyatt had a mischievous sense of humor. He knew his wife preferred the name \\"Josephine\\" and detested \\"Sadie\\", but early in their relationship he began calling her 'Sadie'. Josephine frequently griped about Wyatt‚Äôs lack of work and financial success and even his character and personality. Wyatt would often go on long walks to get away from her. Each may have engaged in extramarital affairs. Josephine could be controlling. Grace Spolidora was a teenager during the Earp's many visits to her family's home near Needles, California and sometimes went to San Diego with them. She attributed the highly exaggerated stories about Wyatt Earp to Josephine. Sadie \\"would always interfere whenever Wyatt would talk with Stuart Lake. She always interfered! She wanted him to look like a church-going saint and blow things up. Wyatt didn't want that at all!\\" Among the facts Josephine wanted scrubbed from Earp's history, she persuaded biographers Flood, Lake and Burns to write that Earp was a non-drinker. Charlie Welsh, Grace Spolidora's father, was a good friend of Earp's. He was known to disappear for days at a time \\"to see property\\", the family euphemism for a drinking binge, and Earp was his regular partner. Director John Ford said that whenever Josephine left town for religious conventions, Earp would come into town, play poker, and get drunk with the cowboy actors. = Nevada to Alaska to Nevada = Wyatt Earp's Northern Saloon, Tonopah, Nevada, circa 1902. The man in the center is believed to be Wyatt Earp, and the woman on the left is often identified as Josephine Earp. The Earps rented this cabin in Rampart, Alaska, from Rex Beach and spent the winter of 1898‚Äì1899 there. On August 5, 1897, Earp and Josie once again joined in a mining boom and left Yuma, Arizona for San Francisco. They planned to head for Alaska to join in the Alaska Gold Rush, but their departure was delayed for three weeks when Wyatt fell while getting off Market Street streetcar and bruised his hip. Josephine got pregnant at the same time, and she thought she could persuade Earp from heading to Alaska. He was in agreement, but Josephine, who was 37, miscarried soon after. They finally boarded the steamship Rosalie on September 21. They boarded the steamship Rosalie for Nome, Alaska on September 21. When they got to Wrangell, the season was already late, and they chose to winter in Rampart. They rented a cabin from Rex Beach for $100 a month and spent the winter of 1898‚Äì1899 there. He managed a small store during the spring of 1899 in St. Michael on the Norton Sound, a major gateway to the Alaskan interior via the Yukon River. In the spring they decided the gold rush in Dawson was drawing to an end and headed for Nome instead. Earp and partner Charles E. Hoxie built the Dexter Saloon, the largest in Nome. Josephine gambled so recklessly that Wyatt cut her off and asked other gambling houses to do the same. She also gambled on the boats to and from Alaska. In November 1899, they left Alaska for a period and went to Seattle, Washington, with a plan to open a saloon and gambling room. On November 25, 1899, the Seattle Star reported Earp's arrival. Although gambling was illegal, the police were paid by John Considine, owner of the three largest gambling concessions, to look the other way. Considine tried to keep Earp from succeeding, and arranged for his establishment to be raided. The Earps returned briefly to San Francisco in April 1900, but they returned to Seattle before boarding the steamer SS Alliance. On June 14, 1900, Wyatt and Josephine were bound for Nome, Alaska. The Earps stayed at the Hollenback Hotel in Los Angeles in December 1901 after returning from Alaska. Wyatt and Josie returned to Los Angeles on December 13, 1901 and stayed at the Hollenbeck Hotel. They had an estimated $80,000, a relative fortune (equivalent to about $ today). In February 1902, they arrived in Tonopah, Nevada, known as the \\"Queen of the Silver Camps,\\" where silver and gold had been discovered in 1900 and a boom was under way. He opened the Northern Saloon in Tonopah and served as a Deputy U.S. Marshal under Marshal J.F. Emmitt. = Desert cottage = Wyatt Earp's camp, tent and ramada near Vidal, California and Wyatt's mining operations. Sadie is at left, Wyatt is on the right with his dog. Wyatt and Josephine Earp in their ramada near their mining claim outside Vidal, California: This is the only confirmed picture of the two of them together. After Tonopah's gold strike waned, Wyatt staked mining claims just outside Death Valley and elsewhere in the Mojave Desert. In 1906 he discovered several deposits of gold and copper near the Sonoran Desert town of Vidal, California on the Colorado River and filed more than 100 mining claims near the Whipple Mountains. Wyatt and Josie Earp summered in Los Angeles and lived in at least nine small Los Angeles rentals as early as 1885 and as late as 1929, mostly in the summer. They bought the only home they ever owned, a small cottage in Vidal, and lived there during the fall, winter and spring months of 1925 ‚Äì 1928, while he worked his Happy Days mines in the Whipple Mountains a few miles north. Wyatt had some modest success with the gold mines and they lived on the slim proceeds of income from that and investments in Oakland and Kern County oil field. Josie's three nieces, daughters of her half-sister Rebecca and husband Aaron Wiener, would frequently visit the couple during the winter months at their desert camp. = Life in Los Angeles = In about 1923, Charles Welsh, a friend who Earp had known since his time in Dodge City in 1876, and a retired railroad engineer, frequently invited the Earps to visit his family in San Bernardino, Needles, and later in Los Angeles. The Earps were frequent visitors and often spent the holidays with the Welsh family, but they did not appreciate Josephine's gambling habits. = Gambling habit = Josephine \\"Sadie\\" Marcus Earp, the common law wife of Wyatt Earp, on July 4, 1921. Josephine loved to play poker and developed a serious gambling habit, losing heavily at times. While they lived in San Diego, Wyatt raced Otto Rex, the horse he had won in a card game. The horse was a frequent winner and sometimes Wyatt bought Josephine some jewelry with the proceeds. To feed her gambling habit, Josephine would pawn the jewelry to millionaire Lucky Baldwin, but Wyatt would later buy the jewelry back. Josephine eventually sold virtually all of her jewelry to Baldwin. Josephine was addicted to gambling on horse racing and her wagering increased until Wyatt gave her an ultimatum. \\"You're not a smart gambler. And you have no business risking money that way. Now after this I'm not going to redeem any more of your jewelry.\\" He also told Baldwin to stop loaning money to Josephine, but she continued to gamble anyway. He was furious about her gambling habit, during which she lost considerable sums of money. Wyatt refereed the Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey boxing match on December 2, 1896 and was accused of fixing the outcome. He called a foul on Fitzsimmons that no one saw, and Wyatt was widely accused of taking a bribe. During an investigation of the boxing match by a panel appointed by San Francisco Mayor Washington Bartlett, they learned Josephine Earp was a \\"degenerate horseplayer\\" and that she frequently took loans out against her jewelry. The San Francisco Examiner ran a series of stories over three days describing Earp's life in exaggerated detail that ridiculed him. Eager to escape the controversy over the boxing match dogging him, Earp gave up managing race horses in San Francisco and on December 20, 1896 he and Josie left for Yuma, Arizona. In the 1920s, Wyatt gave Josie signed legal papers and filing fees to a claim for an oil lease in Kern County, California. She gambled away the filing fees and lied to Wyatt about what happened to the lease, which later turned out to be valuable. Distrustful of her ability to manage her finances, Wyatt made an arrangement with her sister Henrietta Lenhardt. Wyatt put oil leases he owned in Henrietta's name with the agreement that the proceeds would benefit Josie after his death. Henrietta's three children voided the agreement after their mother's death and didn't pass on the royalties to Josephine. = Later relationship with Wyatt = Grace Welsh Spolidora, Welsh's daughter, spent a lot of time with the Earps. She said that during the last years of Wyatt's life, Josephine received an allowance from her family and gambled it away, often leaving Wyatt hungry. Wyatt became critically ill in late 1928. Grace recalled that Josie, who had never had many domestic skills, did very little housekeeping or cooking for Wyatt. She and her sister-in-law Alma were concerned about the care Josie gave Wyatt. Even though he was very ill, she still didn't cook for him. Grace, her sisters, Alma, and her mother brought in meals. Wyatt died on January 13, 1929. Grace Welsh and her sister-in-law Alma were the legal witnesses to Wyatt's cremation. Josephine was apparently too full of grief to assist or to attend the funeral itself. Grace was upset that Josephine didn't attend. \\"She didn't go to his funeral, even. She wasn't that upset. She was peculiar. I don't think she was that devastated when he died.\\" After Wyatt's death, Josephine told her friends and family to stop calling her Sadie, Wyatt's name for her, and insisted they call her Josie. While in Los Angeles, Wyatt and Josephine became friends with many celebrities, including Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper. In 1939 Josephine sued 20th Century Fox for $50,000 in an attempt to keep them from making the film titled Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal. With the provision that Wyatt's name be removed from the title, the movie was released as Frontier Marshal. She received some royalties from the movie and one-half of the royalties earned by Stuart Lake's book about her husband. After Wyatt died, Josephine spent her last years in Los Angeles. = Death and burial = Josephine and Wyatt Earps' grave at the Hills of Eternity cemetery in Colma, California. Josephine Earp was the last surviving member of her immediate family. Her half-sister Rebecca Wiener (Levy), who had three children, died on December 27, 1927, in San Francisco; her mother died on August 17, 1912; her sister Henrietta died in 1911; her brother Nathan died on May 17, 1906; and her father Hyman died on January 25, 1895. When Wyatt died in 1929, she had his body cremated and secretly buried him in the Marcus family plot in the Jewish Hills of Eternity Memorial Park in Colma, California. Josephine died at age 83 on December 20, 1944, in the same bungalow she and Wyatt shared at 4004 W. 17th Street in the West Adams district of Los Angeles. Quoted from, I Married Wyatt Earp p. 207 She died penniless. Sid Grauman of Grauman's Theater and cowboy actor and long-time friend of Wyatt Earp William S. Hart paid for her funeral and burial. Although she was never active in her Jewish faith, her service was conducted by a rabbi. Her body was cremated and buried next to Wyatt's remains. They are buried near her parents and her brother Nathan. Her body was buried with Wyatt's ashes. She paid for a small white marble headstone which was stolen shortly after her death in 1944. It was discovered in a backyard in Fresno, California. A second stone of flat granite was also stolen. On July 7, 1957, grave-robbers dug into the Earp's grave in an apparent attempt to steal the urn containing his ashes, but unable to find them, stole the grave stone. Actor Hugh O'Brien, who was playing Earp in the 1955‚Äì61 television series The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, offered a reward for the stone‚Äôs return. It was located for sale in a flea market. Cemetery officials re-set the stone flush in concrete, but it was stolen again. Actor Kevin Costner, who played Earp in the 1994 movie Wyatt Earp, offered to buy a new, larger stone, but the Marcus family thought his offer was self-serving and declined. Descendants of Josie's half-sister Rebecca allowed a Southern California group in 1998-99 to erect the stone currently in place. The earlier stone is on display in the Colma Historical museum.  In popular culture  In their later years Josephine worked hard to eliminate any mention that she had been Johnny Behan's mistress or of Wyatt's previous common law marriage to the prostitute Mattie Blaylock. = Book I Married Wyatt Earp = Cover of I Married Wyatt Earp, by Glenn Boyer, based in part on the so-called \\"Clum manuscript\\" supposedly written by Josephine. The book was discredited as largely fictional in 1999. The original, unretouched photogravure used by Glen Boyer on the cover of I Married Wyatt Earp. He insisted it was a picture of Josephine from 1880 but the picture was actually copyrighted in 1914. She successfully kept both women's names out of Stuart Lake's biography of Wyatt and after he died, Josephine may have threatened litigation to keep it that way. Lake corresponded with Josephine over several years, and he claimed she attempted to influence what he wrote and hamper him in every way possible, including consulting lawyers. After Wyatt Earp's death, Josephine insisted on being called Josie or Josephine. Josephine sought to get her own life story published and gained the assistance of Wyatt's cousins Mabel Earp Cason and Cason's sister Vinolia Earp Ackerman. They recorded events in her life but found Josephine was evasive about her early life in Tombstone. She approached several publishers for the book, but backed out several times due to their insistence that she be completely open and forthcoming, rather than slanting her memories to her favor. Josephine wanted to keep what she viewed as their tarnished history in Tombstone private. Josephine insisted she was striving to protect Wyatt Earp‚Äôs legacy. She was also in need of money, and tried to sell a collection of books to Lake while he was writing the book. Josephine finally changed her mind and asked Wyatt's cousins to burn their work, but Cason held back a copy, to which Glenn Boyer eventually acquired the rights, and is now in the custody of the Ford County Historical Society in Dodge City. The University of Arizona Press published the book in 1976 under the title I Married Wyatt Earp: The Recollections of Josephine Sarah Marcus. It was immensely popular for many years, becoming the university's fourth all-time best selling book with over 35,000 copies sold. It was cited by scholars and relied upon as factual by filmmakers. Beginning in about 1994, critics began to challenge the accuracy of the book, and eventually many parts of the book were refuted as fictional. In 1998, a series of articles by Tony Ortega in the Phoenix New Times, including interviews with Glenn Boyer, argued that Boyer invented large portions of the book. In 2000, the University responded to criticism of the university and the book and removed it from their catalog. The book has become an example of how supposedly factual works can trip up researchers, historians, and librarians. It was described by the Annual Review of Information Science and Technology in 2006 as a creative exercise that cannot be substantiated or relied on. = Plays and films = * I Married Wyatt Earp (1983) - played by Marie Osmond * Tombstone (1993) - played by Dana Delany * Wyatt Earp (1994) - played by Joanna Going * I Married Wyatt Earp, an all-female musical, produced off-Broadway in 2011.

Some references give the arsenic a variable formula subscript of 2-3. High nickel varieties are referred to as nickel-skutterudite, previously chloanthite. It is a hydrothermal ore mineral found in moderate to high temperature veins with other Ni-Co minerals. Associated minerals are arsenopyrite, native silver, erythrite, annabergite, nickeline, cobaltite, silver sulfosalts, native bismuth, calcite, siderite, barite and quartz. It is mined as an ore of cobalt and nickel with a by- product of arsenic. The crystal structure of this mineral has been found to be exhibited by several compounds with important technological uses. The mineral has a bright metallic luster, and is tin white or light steel gray in color with a black streak. The specific gravity is 6.5 and the hardness is 5.5‚Äì6. Its crystal structure is isometric with cube and octahedron forms similar to that of pyrite. The arsenic content gives a garlic odor when heated or crushed. Skutterudite was discovered in Skuterud Mines, Modum, Buskerud, Norway, in 1845. Smaltite is an alternative name for the mineral. Notable occurrences include Cobalt, Ontario, Skuterud, Norway, and Franklin, New Jersey, in the United States. The rare arsenide minerals are classified in Dana's sulfide mineral group, even though it contains no sulfur. Crystal structure The skutterudite unit cell. The crystal structure of the skutterudite mineral was determined in 1928 by Oftedahlhttps://foreninger.uio.no/ngf/ngt/pdfs/NGT_08_4_250-257.pdf to be cubic, belonging to space group Im-3 (number 204). The unit cell can be considered to consist of eight smaller cubes made up of the Co atoms. Six of these cubes are filled with (almost) square planar rings of As, each of which is oriented parallel to one of the unit cell edges. The As atoms then form octahedra with Co in the center. In crystallographic terms, the Co atoms occupy the 8c sites, while the As atoms occupy the 24g sites. The position of the Co atoms within the unit cell is fixed, while the positions of the As atoms are determined by the parameters x and y. It has been shown that for the As-rings to be fully square, these parameters must satisfy the Oftedahl relation x + y = 1/2. Any deviation from this relation yields a rectangular configuration of the As atoms; indeed, this is the case for all known compounds with this structure, and the As atoms do not form a perfect octahedra. Together with the unit cell size and the assigned space group, the aforementioned parameters fully describe the crystal structure of the material. This structure is often referred to as the skutterudite structure. Applications Materials with a skutterudite structure are studied as a low cost thermoelectric material with low thermal conductivity. See also Thermoelectric_materials#Skutterudite_thermoelectrics.

While being in real or feigned retreat, their horse archers would turn their bodies back in full gallop to shoot at the pursuing enemy. The maneuver required superb equestrian skills, since the rider's hands were occupied by his composite bow. As the stirrup had not been invented at the time of the Parthians, the rider relied solely on pressure from his legs to guide his horse. History In addition to the Parthians and their successors, the Sasanians, this tactic was used by most nomads of the Eurasian steppe, including the Scythians,Adrienne Mayor: \\"The Amazons\\"  Talks at Google Huns, Turks, Magyars, Mongols, Amazoness, Koreans as well as the Urartians. The Parthians used the tactic to great effect in their victory over the Roman general Crassus in the Battle of Carrhae. A tactic similar to the Parthian shot was attributed to the Phoenicians from Sidon by Silius Italicus.Silius Italicus, Punica The tactic was also used by Muslim conqueror Muhammad of Ghor in the Second Battle of Tarain in 1192 against Indian elephants, heavy cavalry and heavy infantry, by Alp Arslan in the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 against the Byzantines, and by Subutai in the Battle of Legnica in 1241 against Polish knights.

Web. May 29, 2012. Document #0F22314D24CC9793. was an American actor in movies and television for more than thirty years. Corbett came to national attention in the early 1960s when he replaced George Maharis in the cast of the popular CBS adventure drama Route 66. He followed this with roles in high-profile films and television shows like the original Star Trek series, the daytime soap opera The Doctors, the prime-time soap Dallas, and movies like Chisum with John Wayne, and the World War II epic Midway. Early years An American lead actor and supporting actor, Corbett was born on August 17, 1933 in El Monte, California, the son of Sarah Bell (Holland) and John Warren Rothenburg, a garage mechanic. After serving in the United States Navy as a Seabee, he met his wife Judy at Occidental College in Los Angeles, and, with her encouragement, he began acting in campus theater plays. He was seen by a talent scout and was signed to a contract with Columbia Pictures. In his youth Corbett had done male modeling for photographer Bob Mizer. Film and television career Corbett's film debut was in The Crimson Kimono (1959); it was followed with supporting roles in The Mountain Road (1960) and Man on a String (1960). He took the lead role in William Castle's suspense thriller, Homicidal in 1961. 1965 saw Corbett playing one of the sons of Jimmy Stewart's character in the Civil War film Shenandoah. In other film work, he starred as Pat Garrett, opposite John Wayne in Chisum. He again co-starred with Wayne in Big Jake (1971). Later, he appeared in Nashville Girl (1976) and Midway (1976). In 1963, Corbett replaced George Maharis on Route 66. Corbett, playing Lincoln Case, co-starred with Martin Milner during part of the third season and the fourth and final season of the series (1963‚Äì64). In 1964‚Äì65, he had a role on Twelve O'Clock High as Lt. Tom Lockridge for two episodes. Corbett's other television roles in the early to late 1960s include Wes Macauley on It's a Man's World (1962‚Äì63). He was featured in 1964 as \\"Dan Collins\\" in an episode of Gunsmoke titled \\"Chicken\\" in which a man gets an undeserved reputation as a gunman when he is found at a way station with four dead outlaws at his feet. In the 1965‚Äì1966 season, Corbett guest-starred on The Legend of Jesse James. Corbett also guest-starred in an episode of The Virginian, entitled \\"The Awakening\\", in which his character, David Henderson, is a destitute former minister who has had a crisis of faith and comes to Medicine Bow just as a dispute breaks out at a local mine over safety issues. He appeared as \\"Chance Reynolds\\", a regular cast member on The Road West (1966‚Äì67). Corbett is remembered by science fiction fans for his guest-starring role in the second season Star Trek episode \\"Metamorphosis\\" (1967) as Zefram Cochrane. In 1971, Corbett had a guest appearance with Mariette Hartley on Gunsmoke (episode: \\"Phoenix\\"). In the 1970s, he had guest-starring roles on the television shows The Mod Squad, Cannon, The Streets of San Francisco, Police Woman, The Rockford Files, and Barnaby Jones. In 1976, Corbett joined the cast of the NBC daytime soap opera The Doctors as Jason Aldrich. He stayed on The Doctors until 1981. Throughout the 1980s, Corbett was a regular cast member in the long-running television series Dallas as Paul Morgan from 1983‚Äì84, and then from 1986‚Äì88. Death In January 1993, Corbett died of lung cancer at the Veterans Administration (VA) hospital in San Antonio, Texas at the age of 59. He was buried in Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery, San Antonio. Selected TV and filmography * Operation Petticoat (1959) as a Seaman * The Crimson Kimono (1959) as Det. Sgt.

It supports true 8-voice polyphony, with two independent synthesizer layers per voice each with its own set of front panel controls, in addition to a number of hardwired preset voice settings and four parameter settings stores based on banks of subminiature potentiometers (rather than the digital programmable presets the Prophet-5 would sport soon after). It has exceptionally complete performer expression features, such as a layered keyboard that was both velocity- sensitive (like a piano's) and pressure-sensitive (\\"after-touch\\") but unlike most modern keyboards the aftertouch could be applied to individual voices rather than in common, and a ribbon controller allowing for polyphonic pitch- bends and glissandos. This can be heard on the Blade Runner soundtrack by Vangelis, in which CS-80 is featured prominently, as well as the composer's soundtrack for the film Chariots of Fire, and the bassline of Peter Howell's interpretation of the 1980 theme tune to the BBC science fiction show Doctor Who. Production of the instrument ceased in 1980. Vying with the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5, and Oberheim OB-X polysynths, the CS-80 is regularly described as the pre-eminent polyphonic analog synthesizer, and commands amongst the highest prices of any polyphonic synthesizer.  Software and hardware emulations  There are two plug-in instrument software emulations of the CS-80 for usage in digital audio workstation, music sequencer, and other software which supports the plug-in formats that these instruments were implemented and released in: the \\"CS-80 V\\" from Arturia which was released in 2003, the \\"ME80\\" from memorymoon which was released in 2009. There are no known hardware clones of the entire CS-80. At the 2014 NAMM Show, Studio Electronics premiered their new Boomstar SE80 synthesizer which includes a cloned filter section of the CS-80.

He has also played in the groups Orb, Space Waltz, Crowded House, The Makers and 801. Rayner has released two solo albums. The first, Horse, was an instrumental offering released in 1995, recorded entirely at Rayner's home studio in Melbourne, Australia. The second was entitled Play it Straight, a play on a Philip Judd Split Enz song called Play it Strange that was a particular favourite of Rayner's during the mid- to late-1970s. The song was not released at the time, but was played live when Judd rejoined the band in 1977. Play it Straight consisted of re-arranged and re-recorded versions of material gleaned from other New Zealand composers. Rayner's keyboard talents were a notable part of the Split Enz sound. Paul McCartney caught one of their shows in 1979 and became a fan of the band, eventually inviting Rayner to play keyboards on his sixth solo album, Press to Play, which was released in 1986. Rayner has also produced material for many artists including Models, Margaret Urlich, Rikki Morris, Margot Smith, and The Exponents, as well as two Enzso recordings with Split Enz members, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. During the late 1990s Eddie Rayner decided to take the Split Enz songs to an orchestral setting. This sparked the idea for the Enzso project. Along with his synth, the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, some Newland Singers and some former members of Split Enz, he created orchestral versions for Split Enz songs. The project ended between late 1999 and early 2000. Recently he has acted as Musical Director for television show New Zealand Idol, and participated in reunions of Split Enz and Space Waltz. He is currently a member of the 1960s cover band The Con-Rays. Rayner has performed Split Enz songs along with other ex-Split Enz members, such as a 2013 tour that included other ex-members Mike Chunn, Geoff Chunn, Emlyn Crowther, and Wally Wilkinson. Vocalists on that tour included The X Factor victor Jackie Thomas, contestant Tom Batchelor, and guest vocalists Annie Crummer, Rima Te Wiata, Rikki Morris and Jesse Sheehan. Eddie's son Harley Rayner is a member of dub band Mt Eden. Instruments During the career of Split Enz, Rayner used a wide, changing array of keyboards. In the band's early progressive rock incarnation keyboards he used included a Mellotron, but his mainstays during the band's most popular phase were a Yamaha CP-80 electro-acoustic piano, a Yamaha CS-80 synthesizer and a Prophet 5. When he played keyboards for Crowded House on tour during the late 1980s, he was seen to be using a Yamaha DX7 and a Yamaha Clavinova. Later, when touring with the Enz for reunions Eddie used a Yamaha Motif and a Clavia Nord Wave.

It is the centre of the City Municipality of Slovenj Gradec. It is part of the historical Styria region, and since 2005 it has belonged to the NUTS-3 Carinthia Statistical Region. It is located in the Mislinja Valley at the eastern end of the Karawanks mountain range, about west of Maribor and northeast of Ljubljana. History Gradec, Slovene for 'little castle', was first mentioned in a 1091 deed, then part of the Imperial March of Styria. The prefix Windisch (the traditional German name for Slavs in general and Slovenes in particular) was added to distinguish it from the city Graz (whose name has the same etymology). The modern Slovene name, Slovenj Gradec (literally: the Slovene Graz), derives from this German denomination. From 1180 until 1918, Slovenj Gradec belonged to the Duchy of Styria, since 1804 a crown land of the Austrian Empire. It was the ancestral seat of the Windisch-Graetz noble family first documented in 1220.Der Gro√üe Brockhaus, Leipzig 1935, vol. 20, p. 359 Upon the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918, with the rest of Lower Styria, it was included in the newly established Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Birthplace of Hugo Wolf Until 1918, the town was a German- speaking island in a Slovene-speaking area. In the 1880 census, the town of Slovenj Gradec was 75 percent German-speaking and 25 percent Slovene- speaking.Meyers Konversationslexikon, 5th ed., Leipzig-Vienna 1897, vol. 17, p. 794 Many inhabitants, like the family of the composer Hugo Wolf, were of mixed ethnic origin. After the end of World War I, many of the local German- speaking inhabitants emigrated to Austria. Those who remained were gradually assimilated into the now Slovene-speaking majority. During World War Two, the town was occupied by the Nazis and annexed to the Third Reich. The local Slovenes were submitted to a policy of violent Germanization and many died of various persecutions. The partisan insurgency developed in the area, especially in the hills to the east of the town. After World War II, the remaining ethnic Germans were expelled from Yugoslavia, and Slovenj Gradec lost its traditional presence of German speakers. From the 1950s onward, the town experienced a rapid industrialization and eventually became the unofficial economic and political center for Slovenian Carinthia. In 1994, it became one of the 11 towns in Slovenia with the status of City (or Urban) Municipality. Main sights The parish church in the town is dedicated to Saint Elizabeth of Hungary and belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Maribor. It was first mentioned in written documents from 1235. Next to it stands a Gothic chapel dedicated to the Holy Spirit with frescos dating to the mid-15th century.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference numbers e≈°d 658 & 659 In 1994, an archaeological excavation uncovered the remains of what is believed to be the oldest church in Styria, dating to the Carolingian period (second half of the 9th century).Mira Strmƒçnik, Sveti Jurij, zakladnica podatkov, Izvr≈°ni svet Skup≈°ƒçine obƒçine Slovenj Gradec, 1994 The Slovenj Gradec Art Gallery () was founded in 1957 and is located on the first floor of the old town hall in the town centre. The gallery hosted international fine art exhibitions under the sponsorship of the United Nations in 1966, 1975, 1979, 1985, and 1991. The 1997 exhibition \\"The Artist and Urban Environment\\" displayed art activity in Peace Messenger Cities from all over the world. In 2012, Slovenj Gradec and Ptuj were partners with Maribor, the European Capital of Culture. As a result, the gallery presented further exhibitions that attracted Europe-wide attention.Koro≈°ka galerija likovne umetnosti Notable residents Notable people that were born or lived in Slovenj Gradec include: *Roman Bezjak (born 1989), footballer *Katarina ƒåas (born 1976), actress *Sa≈°o Fornezzi (born 1982), footballer *Ivan Gams (sl) (1923‚Äì2014), geographer *David Kiselak (born 1988), footballer *Lado Kralj (born 1938), writer, theatre critic, and literary historian *Tina Maze (born 1983), skier, Olympic champion *Bo≈°tjan Nachbar (born 1980), basketball player *Vinko O≈°lak (born 1947), author *Karel Peƒçko (1920‚Äì2016), artist *Iztok Puc (1966‚Äì2011), handball player *Renata Salecl (born 1962), philosopher *Adi Smolar (born 1959), singer-songwriter *Katarina Srebotnik (born 1981), tennis player *Ilka ≈†tuhec (born 1990), alpine ski racer *Marko ≈†uler (born 1983), football player *Nikola Tolimir (born 1989), footballer *Tadej Trdina (born 1988), footballer *Hugo Wolf (1860‚Äì1903), composer.

The channel was available to all digital cable providers and satellite provider Dish Network. With its focus on classic Nickelodeon game shows (most of which had been removed from the parent network between 1999‚Äì2002), Nick GAS was essentially a children's version of (and Viacom's answer to) Game Show Network, which launched on December 1, 1994. The VP/General Manager of the network was Nickelodeon executive Mark Offitzer, producer of numerous Nick specials including the Kids Choice Awards. Summer Sanders was named on-air Commissioner of the network; Dave Aizer (1999‚Äì2003) and Vivianne Collins (1999‚Äì2003) were the network's original on- air hosts, with Mati Moralejo (2001‚Äì05) joining soon after and later on Nadine (2004) and George (2004) separately during commercials. History Nick GAS originally launched as a one-hour block on Nickelodeon, featuring game & sports-related shows like Wild & Crazy Kids, GUTS and Figure It Out. The block was eventually removed from Nickelodeon's schedule. Nick GAS launched on March 1, 1999, and its programming primarily consisted of children's game shows and sports-related programs from Nickelodeon, its parent network. This included shows such as GUTS, all versions of Double Dare from 1986 onward, and Figure It Out (which ended its run on the sister network nine months after Nick GAS's launch). Nick GAS also produced its own original programming, such as Play to Z, Gamefarm and Splash TV. GAS also featured original blocks Camp GAS during the summer, Double Dare Double Play (both removed in 2004), and Pumping GAS (removed in 2005). In place of commercials, Nick GAS aired interstitial segments, some of which were produced at Nickelodeon on Sunset and the defunct Nickelodeon Studios at Universal Studios Florida, promos for Nick GAS original programming, aired during commercial breaks. However, in-show advertising (like consolation and grand prizes of the network's shows) were left intact, as it was part of the show itself. The studio segments in the \\"GAS Garage\\", often included competitions between families, or interviews with athletes and other celebrities. Programs were usually grouped together in the blocks Heads Up!, Wild Card, Family Fuel, Extreme GAS (all removed in 2002) and aired during commercial breaks. Other interstitials included \\"Heroes of the Game\\", \\"GAS Grill\\", \\"Trade Tricks\\", \\"Time Out\\", T.U.M.E.G., \\"Skill Drill\\", \\"MLS Play of the Week\\", \\"Global GAS\\", \\"Home Turf Highlights\\", \\"Let's Just Play ads\\", \\"In Play Today\\", \\"All Access\\", \\"FastBreak\\", \\"GasCaster Report\\", and in the early years of the network \\"This Day in History\\". From October 31, 2005 onwards, Nick GAS's programming was fully automated, putting seven shows on a permanent timeslot (GUTS, Legends of the Hidden Temple, Figure It Out, Get the Picture, Double Dare 2000, Nick Arcade and Finders Keepers) and regular segments. On September 2006, Finders Keepers was removed from the network, leaving only six shows on the channel by its last years. =Shutdown= On August 13, 2007, Viacom announced that Nick GAS would shut down on December 31, 2007. It was replaced by a 24-hour version of Noggin's teen-oriented block The N, which started airing on Noggin in mid-2002. On December 31, 2007, Nick GAS officially closed after an episode of Figure It Out. A bumper was briefly aired afterwards, which was interrupted by The N's programming stream. The N's separate channel was subsequently replaced by TeenNick on September 28, 2009. Dish Network retained an automated loop of Nick GAS on the air for 15 months, continuing to maintain the split of Noggin/The N manually on its existing channel slot. On April 23, 2009, Dish announced it would remove Nick GAS and replace it with the Pacific feed of Cartoon Network the following day, and it ended at 3:30 a.m. ET after an episode of Legends of the Hidden Temple before switching to the Pacific feed of Adult Swim in progress. Both Noggin and The N finally acquired their own 24/7 Dish channels weeks later. =Pluto TV revival as NickGames= On November 19, 2019, Viacom announced the addition of several new networks to its Pluto TV video streaming service, including a new network called NickGames. The network featured much of the older Nickelodeon game show programming carried by Nick GAS, along with newer Nickelodeon competition and reality programming produced after Nick GAS's demise. On August 18, 2020, NickGames was removed from the Pluto TV lineup and the programming moved to a separate channel titled \\"Pluto TV Tween\\". Programs Nick GAS aired every game show broadcast on Nickelodeon from the sister network's inception onward, as well as non-game programming such as Salute Your Shorts, Speed Racer X, Scaredy Camp, and Rocket Power (all of which mainly involved extreme sports and competition). The network also aired a one-hour block of video game programming on Saturday nights from 2003‚Äì04. Play to Z (mainly re-purposed content from the British Game Network) and Nickelodeon Gamefarm (an original series featuring video game news and competitions) aired during this time. Nick GAS also acquired reruns of Nickelodeon Robot Wars, a program adapted from the UK original.

Epstein (August 22, 1909December 30, 2000) was an American screenwriter, who had a long career, best remembered for his screenplay, written with his twin brother, Philip, and Howard E. Koch, of the film Casablanca (1942), for which the writers won an Academy Award. It was adapted from an unpublished play, Everybody Comes to Rick's, written by Murray Bennett and Joan Alison. His identical twin died in 1952, a loss that he felt for the rest of his life. He continued writing, receiving two more Oscar nominations. In 1998, he received a Los Angeles Film Critics Association career achievement award. His credits included Four Daughters (1938) for which he received his first Oscar nomination, The Bride Came C.O.D. (1941), The Man Who Came to Dinner (1942), Mr. Skeffington (1944), The Tender Trap (1955), Light in the Piazza (1962), Send Me No Flowers (1964), Pete 'n' Tillie (1972), Cross of Iron (1977) and Reuben, Reuben (1983). Epstein had a less successful result as a playwright in Broadway theatre. His play, But, Seriously (starring Richard Dreyfuss and Tom Poston) would prove to be the last to be staged at Henry Miller's Theatre for more than 30 years, opening on February 27, 1969, and closing after only four performances.\\"Henry Miller's Theatre\\", in Broadway: An Encyclopedia, by Ken Bloom (Routledge, 2013) pp335-336 Biography Epstein was born Julius EpsteinThe middle initial J. was added at an early stage of his career when he was working with a small advertising agency started by a college friend.

Their parents owned a livery stable at a time when horses were widely used in the city. He and Philip both graduated from The Pennsylvania State University in 1931, where they were champions in boxing; Julius became an NCAA Bantamweight Champion. He graduated with a BA in Arts and Letters. He maintained close ties with Penn State throughout his life (often as a guest lecturer at the film school). At his request, he was buried in a Penn State polo shirt. After college, the Epsteins went to Hollywood, hoping to work in the movies. They became successful screenwriters and began collaborating in 1939. They were noted for their Academy Award-winning Casablanca, written together with Howard Koch and the uncredited Casey Robinson. Jack L. Warner, head of Warner Brothers, had a tortuous relationship with the Epstein twins. While he could not argue with their commercial acumen, he deplored their pranks, their work habits and the hours they kept. In 1952, Warner gave their names to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). They never testified before the committee, but on a HUAC questionnaire, when asked if they ever were members of a \\"subversive organization,\\" they responded, \\"Yes.

Epstein married Ann (1919-2003) and they had a son Philip, who died in 2000. He died on December 30, 2000, in Los Angeles, California. Career Epstein shared an Academy Award nomination for the screenplay of Four Daughters, written with Lenore Coffee (with Thyra Samter Winslow contributing to the treatment and Lawrence Kimble contributing to the script), as an adaptation from Frances Hurst's novel, Sister Act. In 1944, the Epstein brothers attempted their first film in the capacity of both writers and producers with \\"Mr. Skeffington.\\" The picture was a box-office success and won both Bette Davis and Claude Rains Oscar nominations.Joanne L.

After leaving Warner Bros. in 1948, the Epstein brothers wrote five more screenplays together, two of which, The Last Time I Saw Paris and The Brothers Karamazov, were released after Philip Epstein's death in 1952. Notable quote About writing under the studio system of the 1930s and '40s, Epstein said in a 1984 interview: > There wasn't one moment of reality in 'Casablanca.' We weren't making art. > We were making a living. Movies in those days were prevented from reality. > Every leading man had to be a great sexual athlete. Every boy and girl had > to 'meet cute,' and the girl had to dislike the hero when they met. If a > woman committed adultery, she had to die. Now the woman who commits adultery > is your heroine.

The structure of the mineral has been questioned, as spectrographic studies suggest material identified as chrysocolla may be a mixture of the copper hydroxide spertiniite and chalcedony. History The name comes from the ancient Greek œáœÅœÖœÉœåœÇ (chrysos) and Œ∫ŒøŒªŒªŒ± (kolla), \\"gold\\" and \\"glue,\\" in allusion to the name of the material used to solder gold and was first used by Theophrastus in 315 BC. Geology Chrysocolla has a cyan (blue-green) color and is a minor ore of copper, having a hardness of 2.5 to 7.0. It is of secondary origin and forms in the oxidation zones of copper ore bodies. Associated minerals are quartz, limonite, azurite, malachite, cuprite, and other secondary copper minerals. It is typically found as botryoidal or rounded masses and crusts, or vein fillings. Because of its light color, it is sometimes confused with turquoise. Notable occurrences include Bacan Islands, Indonesia, Israel, Democratic Republic of Congo, Chile, Cornwall in England, and Arizona, Utah, Idaho, Colorado, New Mexico, Michigan, and Pennsylvania in the United States. A 2006 study has produced evidence that chrysocolla may be a microscopic mixture of the copper hydroxide mineral spertiniite, amorphous silica and water.Fran√ßois Farges, Karim Benzerara, Gordon E. Brown, Jr.; Chrysocolla Redefined as Spertiniite; SLAC-PUB-12232; 13th International Conference On X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS13); July 9-14, 2006; Stanford, California Jewelry Due to being somewhat more common than turquoise, its wide availability, and vivid, beautiful blue and blue-green colors, chrysocolla has been popular for use as a gemstone for carvings and ornamental use since antiquity. It is often used in silversmithing and goldsmithing in place of turquoise and is relatively easy to work and shape. Chrysocolla exhibits a wide range of Mohs hardness ranging from 2 through 7, which is dependent on the amount of silica incorporated into the stone when it is forming. Generally, dark navy blue chrysocolla is too soft to be used in jewelry, while cyan, green, and blue-green chrysocolla can have a hardness approaching 6, similar to turquoise. Chrysocolla Chalcedony is a heavily silicified form of chrysocolla that forms in quartz deposits and can be very hard and approach a hardness of 7.

Garden design may be done by the garden owner themselves, or by professionals of varying levels of experience and expertise. Most professional garden designers have some training in horticulture and the principles of design. Some are also landscape architects, a more formal level of training that usually requires an advanced degree and often a state license. Amateur gardeners may also attain a high level of experience from extensive hours working in their own gardens, through casual study, serious study in Master Gardener Programs, or by joining gardening clubs. Elements Whether gardens are designed by a professional or an amateur, certain principles form the basis of effective garden design, resulting in the creation of gardens to meet the needs, goals, and desires of the users or owners of the gardens. Elements of garden design include the layout of hard landscape, such as paths, walls, water features, sitting areas and decking; as well as the plants themselves, with consideration for their horticultural requirements, their season-to-season appearance, lifespan, growth habit, size, speed of growth, and combinations with other plants and landscape features. Consideration is also given to the maintenance needs of the garden, including the time or funds available for regular maintenance, which can affect the choice of plants in terms of speed of growth, spreading or self-seeding of the plants, whether annual or perennial, and bloom-time, and many other characteristics. Important considerations in the garden design include how the garden will be used, the desired stylistic genre (formal or informal, modern or traditional etc.), and the way the garden space will connect to the home or other structures in the surrounding areas. All of these considerations are subject to the limitations of the prescribed budget. =Location= A garden's location can have a substantial influence on its design. Topographical landscape features such as steep slopes, vistas, hills, and outcrops may suggest or determine aspects of design such as layout and can be used and augmented in order to create a particular impression. The soils of the site will affect what types of plant may be grown, as will the garden's climate zone and various microclimates. The locational context of the garden can also influence its design. For example, an urban setting may require a different design style In contrast to a rural one. Similarly, a windy coastal location may necessitate a different treatment compared to a sheltered inland site. =Soil= The quality of a garden's soil can have a significant influence on a garden's design and its subsequent success. Soil influences the availability of water and nutrients, the activity of soil micro-organisms, and temperature within the root zone, and thus may have a determining effect on the types of plants which will grow successfully in the garden. However, soils may be replaced or improved in order to make them more suitable. Traditionally, garden soil is improved by amendment, the process of adding beneficial materials to the native subsoil and particularly the topsoil. The added materials, which may consist of compost, peat, sand, mineral dust, or manure, among others, are mixed with the soil to the preferred depth. The amount and type of amendment may depend on many factors, including the amount of existing soil humus, the soil structure (clay, silt, sand, loam etc.), the soil acidity/alkalinity, and the choice of plants to be grown. One source states that, \\"conditioning the soil thoroughly before planting enables the plants to establish themselves quickly and so play their part in the design.\\"Brookes, John (1991). The Book of Garden Design. New York: A Dorling Kindersly Book, pp.213. However, not all gardens are, or should be, amended in this manner, since many plants prefer an impoverished soil. In this case, poor soil is better than a rich soil that has been artificially enriched.Brookes, John (1998). Natural Landscapes. New York : Dorling Kindersly Limited, pp.54. =Boundaries= The design of a garden can be affected by the nature of its boundaries, both external and internal, and in turn the design can influence the boundaries, including via creation of new ones. Planting can be used to modify an existing boundary line by softening or widening it. Introducing internal boundaries can help divide or break up a garden into smaller areas. The main types of boundary within a garden are hedges, walls and fences. A hedge may be evergreen or deciduous, formal or informal, short or tall, depending on the style of the garden and purpose of the boundary. A wall has a strong foundation beneath it at all points, and is usually - but not always - built from brick, stone or concrete blocks. A fence differs from a wall in that it is anchored only at intervals, and is usually constructed using wood or metal (such as iron or wire mesh). Boundaries may be constructed for several reasons: to keep out livestock or intruders, to provide privacy, to create shelter from strong winds and provide microclimates, to screen unattractive structures or views, and to create an element of surprise. =Surfaces= Naturalistic planting design In temperate western gardens, a smooth expanse of lawn is often considered essential to a garden. However garden designers may use other surfaces, for example those \\"made up of loose gravel, small pebbles, or wood chips\\" in order to create a different appearance and feel.Brookes, John (1991). The Book of Garden Design. New York : A Dorling Kindersly Book, pp.226. Designers may also utilise the contrast in texture and color between different surfaces in order to create an overall pattern in the design. Surfaces for paths and access points are chosen for practical as well as aesthetic reasons. Issues such as safety, maintenance and durability may need to be considered by the designer. Gardens designed for public access need to cope with heavier foot traffic and hence may utilise surfaces ‚Äì such as resin-bonded gravel ‚Äì that are rarely used in private gardens. =Planting design= Planting design requires design talent and aesthetic judgement combined with a good level of horticultural, ecological and cultural knowledge. It includes two major traditions: formal rectilinear planting design (Persia and Europe); and formal asymmetrical (Asia) and naturalistic planting design. History Persian gardens are credited with originating aesthetic and diverse planting design. A correct Persian garden will be divided into four sectors with water being very important for both irrigation and aesthetics. The four sectors symbolize the Zoroastrian elements of sky, earth, water and plants. Planting in ancient and Medieval European gardens was often a mix of herbs for medicinal use, vegetables for consumption, and flowers for decoration. Purely aesthetic planting layouts developed after the Medieval period in Renaissance gardens, as are shown in late-renaissance paintings and plans. The designs of the Italian Renaissance garden were geometrical and plants were used to form spaces and patterns. The gardens of the French Renaissance and Baroque Garden √† la fran√ßaise era continued the 'formal garden' planting aesthetic. In Asia the asymmetrical traditions of planting design in Chinese gardens and Japanese gardens originated in the Jin Dynasty (265‚Äì420) of China. The gardens' plantings have a controlled but naturalistic aesthetic. In Europe the arrangement of plants in informal groups developed as part of the English Landscape Garden style, and subsequently the French landscape garden, and was strongly influenced by the picturesque art movement. Application Garden chairs and table A planting plan gives specific instructions, often for a contractor about how the soil is to be prepared, what species are to be planted, what size and spacing is to be used and what maintenance operations are to be carried out under the contract. Owners of private gardens may also use planting plans, not for contractual purposes, as an aid to thinking about a design and as a record of what has been planted. A planting strategy is a long term strategy for the design, establishment and management of different types of vegetation in a landscape or garden. Planting can be established by directly employed gardeners and horticulturalists or it can be established by a landscape contractor (also known as a landscape gardener). Landscape contractors work to drawings and specifications prepared by garden designers or landscape architects. =Garden furniture= Garden furniture may range from a patio set consisting of a table, four or six chairs and a parasol, through benches, swings, various lighting, to stunning artifacts in brutal concrete or weathered oak.The Book of Garden Furniture, Charles Thonger, BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2008, Patio heaters, that run on bottled butane or propane, are often used to enable people to sit outside at night or in cold weather. A picnic table, is used for the purpose of eating a meal outdoors such as in a garden. The materials used to manufacture modern patio furniture include stones, metals, vinyl, plastics, resins, glass, and treated woods. =Sunlight= While sunlight is not always easily controlled by the gardener, it is an important element of garden design. The amount of available light is a critical factor in determining what plants may be grown. Sunlight will, therefore, have a substantial influence on the character of the garden. For example, a rose garden is generally not successful in full shade, while a garden of hostas may not thrive in hot sun. As another example, a vegetable garden may need to be placed in a sunny location, and if that location is not ideal for the overall garden design goals, the designer may need to change other aspects of the garden. In some cases, the amount of available sunlight can be influenced by the gardener. The location of trees, other shade plants, garden structures, or, when designing an entire property, even buildings, might be selected or changed based on their influence in increasing or reducing the amount of sunlight provided to various areas of the property. In other cases, the amount of sunlight is not under the gardener's control. Nearby buildings, plants on other properties, or simply the climate of the local area, may limit the available sunlight. Or, substantial changes in the light conditions of the garden may not be within the gardener's means. In this case, it is important to plan a garden that is compatible with the existing light conditions. =Lighting= Garden lighting can be an important aspect of garden design. In most cases, various types of lighting techniques may be classified and defined by heights: safety lighting, uplighting, and downlighting. Safety lighting is the most practical application. However, it is more important to determine the type of lamps and fittings needed to create the desired effects. Light regulates three major plant processes: photosynthesis, phototropism, and photoperiodism. Photosynthesis provides the energy required to produce the energy source of plants. Phototropism is the effect of light on plant growth that causes the plant to grow toward or away from the light.American Horticultural Society (1980). Houseplants. Ortho Books and the Franklin Library, Photoperiodism is a plant‚Äôs response or capacity to respond to photoperiod, a recurring cycle of light and dark periods of constant length.\\"Phoroperiodism.\\" The Merriam-Webster Dicrionary Online. Types of gardens Moorish Generalife courtyard fountain =Islamic gardens= Garden design, and the Islamic garden tradition, began with creating the Paradise garden in Ancient Persia, in Western Asia. It evolved over the centuries, and in the different cultures Islamic dynasties came to rule in Central‚Äî South Asia, the Near East, North Africa, and the Iberian Peninsula. Examples Some styles and examples include: *Persian gardens :*Eram Garden :*Fin Garden *Mughal gardens :*Nishat Bagh :*Shalimar Gardens (Lahore) :*Yadavindra Gardens (Pinjore) *Charbagh :*Taj Mahal :*Tomb of Humayun gardens *Bagh (garden) :*Bagh-e Babur :*Shalimar Bagh (Srinagar) *Al- Andalus‚ÄîMoorish architecture and gardens :*Alc√°zar of Seville :*Alhambra :*Generalife Andalusian Patio of C√≥rdoba, Spain =Mediterranean gardens= Garden design history and precedents from the Mediterranean region include: *Ancient Greek and Hellenistic gardens *Ancient Roman gardens :*Peristyle gardens ‚Äîevolved into Cloister gardens. :*House of the Vettii ‚Äî Pompeii. :*Horti Sallustiani *Byzantine gardens *Spanish gardens :*Andalusian Patio =Renaissance and Formal gardens= French formal garden and parterre at Ch√¢teau de Villandry in the Loire Valley Jardin de Saxe (Plan of the Saxon Garden) A plan of a formal garden for a country estate in Wales, 1765 A formal garden in the Persian garden and European garden design traditions is rectilinear and axial in design. The equally formal garden, without axial symmetry (asymmetrical) or other geometries, is the garden design tradition of Chinese gardens and Japanese gardens. The Zen garden of rocks, moss and raked gravel is an example. The Western model is an ordered garden laid out in carefully planned geometric and often symmetrical lines. Lawns and hedges in a formal garden need to be kept neatly clipped for maximum effect. Trees, shrubs, subshrubs and other foliage are carefully arranged, shaped and continually maintained. A French garden or Garden √† la fran√ßaise, is a specific kind of formal garden, laid out in the manner of Andr√© Le N√¥tre; it is centered on the fa√ßade of a building, with radiating avenues and paths of gravel, lawns, parterres and pools (bassins) of reflective water enclosed in geometric shapes by stone coping, with fountains and sculpture. The Garden √† la fran√ßaise style has origins in fifteenth-century Italian Renaissance gardens, such as the Villa d'Este, Boboli Gardens, and Villa Lante in Italy. The style was brought to France and expressed in the gardens of the French Renaissance. Some of the earliest formal parterres of clipped evergreens were those laid out at Anet by Claude Mollet, the founder of a dynasty of nurserymen-designers that lasted deep into the 18th century. The Gardens of Versailles are an ultimate example of Garden √† la fran√ßaise, composed of many different distinct gardens, and designed by Andr√© Le N√¥tre. English Renaissance gardens in a rectilinear formal design were a feature of the stately homes. The introduction of the parterre was at Wilton House in the 1630s. In the early eighteenth century, the publication of Dezallier d'Argenville, La th√©orie et la pratique du jardinage (1709) was translated into English and German, and was the central document for the later formal gardens of Continental Europe. Traditional formal Spanish garden design evolved with Persian garden and European Renaissance garden influences. The internationally renowned Alhambra and Generalife in Granada, built in the Moorish Al-Andalus era, have influenced design for centuries. The Ibero- American Exposition of 1929 World's Fair in Seville, Spain was located in the celebrated Maria Luisa Park (Parque de Maria Luisa) designed by Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier.Sevilla-Parque de Maria Luisa. accessed 8 April 2010. Formal gardening in the Italian and French manners was reintroduced at the turn of the twentieth century. Beatrix Farrand's formal Italian garden areas at Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, D.C., and Achille Duch√™ne's restored French water parterre at Blenheim Palace in England are examples of the modern formal garden. The Conservatory Garden in Central Park of New York City features a formal garden, as do many other parks and estates such as Filoli in California. The simplest formal garden would be a box-trimmed hedge lining or enclosing a carefully laid out flowerbed or garden bed of simple geometric shape, such as a knot garden. The more developed and elaborate formal gardens contain statuary and fountains. Formal garden laid out at the Abbaye de Valloires, Picardy, by Gilles Cl√©ment, 1987 Features in a formal garden may include: *Terrace *Topiary *Statuary *Hedge *Bosquet *Parterre *Sylvan theater *Pergola *Pavilion *Landscaping =English Landscape and Naturalistic gardens= The English Landscape Garden style practically swept away the geometries of earlier English and European Renaissance formal gardens. William Kent and Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown were leading proponents, among many other designers. The naturalistic English Garden style (French: Jardin anglais, Italian: Giardino all'inglese, German: Englischer Landschaftsgarten) of the 1730s and on transformed private and civic garden design across Europe. The French Landscape Garden subsequently continued the style's development on the Continent. =Cottage gardens= A cottage garden uses an informal design, traditional materials, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants. Cottage gardens go back many centuries, but their popularity grew in 1870s England in response to the more structured Victorian English estate gardens that used restrained designs with massed beds of brilliantly colored greenhouse annuals. They are more casual by design, depending on grace and charm rather than grandeur and formal structure.Schulman, p. 1 The influential British garden authors and designers, William Robinson at Gravetye Manor in Sussex, and Gertrude Jekyll at Munstead Wood in Surrey, both wrote and gardened in England. Jekyll's series of thematic gardening books emphasized the importance and value of natural plantings were an influence in Europe and the United States. Also influential half a century later was Margery Fish, whose surviving garden at East Lambrook Manor emphasizes, among other things, native plant life and the natural patterns produced by self-spreading and self-seeding. The earliest cottage gardens were far more practical than modern versions‚Äîwith an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with fruit trees, beehives, and even livestock if land allowed. Flowers were used to fill any spaces in between. Over time, flowers became more dominant.Scott-James, The Pleasure Garden, p. 80. Modern day cottage gardens include countless regional and personal variations of the more traditional English cottage garden.White, p. 95. =Kitchen garden or potager= Formal potager at Villandry, France An illustration from Walter Crane's 1906 book,Flowers from Shakespeare's Garden: a Posy from the Plays The traditional kitchen garden, also known as a potager, is a seasonally used space separate from the rest of the residential garden ‚Äì the ornamental plants and lawn areas. Most vegetable gardens are still miniature versions of old family farm plots with square or rectangular beds, but the kitchen garden is different not only in its history, but also its design. The kitchen garden may be a landscape feature that can be the central feature of an ornamental, all-season landscape, but can be little more than a humble vegetable plot. It is a source of herbs, vegetables, fruits, and flowers, but it is also a structured garden space, a design based on repetitive geometric patterns. The kitchen garden has year-round visual appeal and can incorporate permanent perennials or woody plantings around (or among) the annual plants. =Shakespeare garden= A Shakespeare garden is a themed garden that cultivates plants mentioned in the works of William Shakespeare. In English-speaking countries, particularly the United States, these are often public gardens associated with parks, universities, and Shakespeare festivals. Shakespeare gardens are sites of cultural, educational, and romantic interest and can be locations for outdoor weddings. Signs near the plants usually provide relevant quotations. A Shakespeare garden usually includes several dozen species, either in herbaceous profusion or in a geometric layout with boxwood dividers. Typical amenities are walkways and benches and a weather- resistant bust of Shakespeare. Shakespeare gardens may accompany reproductions of Elizabethan architecture. Some Shakespeare gardens also grow species typical of the Elizabethan period but not mentioned in Shakespeare's plays or poetry. =Rock garden= A naturalistic rockery in England Rock garden in Chandigarh, India A rock garden, also known as a rockery or an alpine garden, is a type of garden that features extensive use of rocks or stones, along with plants native to rocky or alpine environments. Rock garden plants tend to be small, both because many of the species are naturally small, and so as not to cover up the rocks. They may be grown in troughs (containers), or in the ground. The plants will usually be types that prefer well-drained soil and less water. The usual form of a rock garden is a pile of rocks, large and small, aesthetically arranged, and with small gaps between, where the plants will be rooted. Some rock gardens incorporate bonsai. Some rock gardens are designed and built to look like natural outcrops of bedrock. Stones are aligned to suggest a bedding plane and plants are often used to conceal the joints between the stones. This type of rock garden was popular in Victorian times, often designed and built by professional landscape architects. The same approach is sometimes used in modern campus or commercial landscaping, but can also be applied in smaller private gardens. The Japanese rock garden, in the west often referred to as Zen garden, is a special kind of rock garden which contains few plants. Rock gardens have become increasingly popular as landscape features in tropical countries such as Thailand. The combination of wet weather and heavy shade trees, along with the use of heavy plastic liners to stop unwanted plant growth, has made this type of arrangement ideal for both residential and commercial gardens due to its easier maintenance and drainage. =Native garden= Natural landscaping, also called native gardening, is the use of native plants, including trees, shrubs, groundcover, and grasses which are indigenous to the geographic area of the garden. Banksia spinulosa, a Sydney local plant which attracts wildlife Natural landscaping is adapted to the climate, geography and hydrology and should require no pesticides, fertilizers and watering to maintain, given that native plants have adapted and evolved to local conditions over thousands of years. However, these applications may be necessary for some preventive care of trees and other vegetation in areas of degraded or weedy landscapes. Native plants suit today's interest in \\"low-maintenance\\" gardening and landscaping, with many species vigorous and hardy and able to survive winter cold and summer heat. Once established, they can flourish without irrigation or fertilization, and are resistant to most pests and diseases. Many municipalities have quickly recognized the benefits of natural landscaping due to municipal budget constraints and reductions and the general public is now benefiting from the implementation of natural landscaping techniques to save water and create more personal time. Native plants provide suitable habitat for native species of butterflies, birds, pollinators, and other wildlife. They provide more variety in gardens by offering myriad alternatives to the often planted introduced species, cultivars, and invasive species. The indigenous plants have co- evolved with animals, fungi and microbes, to form a complex network of relationships. They are the foundation of their native habitats and ecosystems, or natural communities.. Such gardens often benefit from the plants being evolved and habituated to the local climate, pests and herbivores, and soil conditions, and so may require fewer to no soil amendments, irrigation, pesticides, and herbicides for a lower maintenance, more sustainable landscape. =East Asian gardens= Japanese and Korean gardens, originally influenced by Chinese gardens, can be found at Buddhist temples and historic sites, private homes, in neighborhood or city parks, and at historical landmarks such as Buddhist temples. Some of the Japanese gardens most famous in the Western world and Japan are gardens in the karesansui (rock garden) tradition. The Ry≈çan-ji temple garden is a well-known example. There are Japanese gardens of various styles, with plantings and often evoking wabi sabi simplicity. In Japanese culture, garden-making is a high art, intimately linked to the arts of calligraphy and ink painting. =Contemporary garden= Contemporary garden The contemporary style garden has gained popularity in the UK in the last 10 years. This is partly due to the increase of modern housing with small gardens as well as the cultural shift towards contemporary design . This style of garden can be defined by the use 'clean' design lines, with focus on hard landscaping materials like stone, hardwood, rendered walls. Contemporary water feature Planting style is bold but simple with the use of drifts of one or two plants that repeat throughout the design. Grasses are a very popular choice for this style of design. Lighting effects also play an integral role in the modern garden. Subtle lighting effects can be achieved with the use of carefully placed low voltage LED lights incorporated into paving and walls. =Residential gardens= A residential or private domestic garden, is the most common form of garden and is in proximity to a residence, such as the 'front garden' or 'back garden'. The front garden may be a formal and semi-public space and so subject to the constraints of convention and local laws. While typically found in the yard of the residence, a garden may also be established on a roof, in an atrium or courtyard, on a balcony, in windowboxes, or on a patio. Residential gardens are typically designed at human scale, as they are most often intended for private use. However, the garden of a great house or a large estate may be larger than a public park. Residential gardens may feature specialized gardens, such as those for exhibiting one particular type of plant, or special features, such as rockery or water features. They are also used for growing herbs and vegetables and are thus an important element of sustainability. Some early residential gardens include the Donnell Garden in Sonoma, California. The garden was designed by landscape architect, Thomas Church, with Lawrence Halprin and architect, George T. Rockrise, which was completed in 1948. The garden is currently regarded as a modernist icon and has been applauded for its well maintained garden of its time. The garden was recognized for its unique and organic forms that represented a modern style of California. The garden is on top of a hillside overlooking the northern area of San Francisco Bay.

The Travel Channel was launched on February 1, 1987; it was founded by TWA Marketing Services (a subsidiary of Trans World Airlines), presumably to boost airline patronage. The channel's name was derived from the travel- related filler programming that aired between programs on the Home Theater Network. TWA purchased the name rights from Group W Satellite Communications in 1986, and took over HTN's transponder spot following the shutdown of the premium cable channel in January 1987. In 1997 the network was later sold to Landmark Communications, then-owner of The Weather Channel, and eventually to Paxson Communications. Discovery Communications acquired a 70% ownership stake in the channel in 1997, and subsequently acquired the remaining 30% interest from Paxson in 1999.

No ring roads are built on this route but it is still called \\"1st Ring\\". From that on, ring road built on Beijing's historic city limit is called 2nd Ring. =Expressways= The Jingtong Expressway :Main topic: Expressways of Beijing Nine toll expressways link Beijing to its suburbs, outlying regions, and other cities; these are: * Jingzang Expressway (Madian Bridge to Badaling and Yanqing county) * Jingcheng Expressway (Connects Beijing to Chengde in Hebei province) * Airport Expressway (Sanyuanqiao to Beijing Capital International Airport) * Jingtong Expressway (Dawang Bridge ‚Äì Tongzhou District]) * Jingha Expressway (Beiguan Roundabout ‚Äì Yanjiao in Hebei province) * Jingshen Expressway (Sifang Bridge ‚Äì Shenyang) * Jinghu Expressway (Runs from Beijing to Shanghai) * Jingkai Expressway (Yuquanying‚ÄìYufa) * Jingshi Expressway (Liuliqiao‚ÄìShijiazhuang) =China National Highways= Map of central Beijing (1988) Eleven China National Highway routes depart from Beijing in virtually all compass directions: * China National Highway 101 (Dongzhimen‚ÄìChengde‚ÄìShenyang) * China National Highway 102 (Chaoyangmen‚ÄìHarbin) * China National Highway 103 (Fenzhongsi‚ÄìTianjin‚ÄìTanggu) * China National Highway 104 (Yongdingmen‚ÄìFuzhou) * China National Highway 105 (Yongdingmen‚ÄìZhuhai‚ÄìMacau) * China National Highway 106 (Yuquanying‚ÄìGuangzhou) * China National Highway 107 (Guang'anmen‚ÄìShenzhen) * China National Highway 108 (Fuxingmen‚ÄìKunming) * China National Highway 109 (Fuchengmen‚ÄìLhasa) * China National Highway 110 (Deshengmen‚ÄìYinchuan) * China National Highway 111 (Dongzhimen‚ÄìHeilongjiang province) =Traffic congestion= Beijing as of 2011 has an estimated 5 million registered cars on its roads, so traffic congestion is widespread. Traffic in the city centre is often gridlocked and is only predicted to get worse as the number of vehicles on Beijing's roads increase. It is predicted by 2016 Beijing will have over 6 million cars on its roads. To combat congestion the local government has rapidly been building the subway system adding more lines and working towards doubling the length of the subway system by 2015. In addition to this they have decreased the cost of fares in an attempt to encourage more people to use public transport. In 2008 Beijing introduced restrictions on the number of cars on its roads in attempt to reduce congestion and pollution during the Olympic games period. They did this by adopting odd-even traffic restriction on alternative days. Cars with number plates ending with odd numbers were restricted one day and the next day cars with number plates ending with even numbers were restricted. Drivers who were unable to use their cars did not have to pay road or vehicle taxes, costing the city around 1.3 billion yuan. Urban public transportation Beijing has an extensive public transportation network of buses, trolleybuses, suburban rail and a rapidly expanding subway system. In 2011, 42% of commuters used public transit in Beijing. =Beijing Subway= The Beijing Subway now has 23 lines, of lines and 394 stations in operation. Subway travel is generally fast, clean, economical and during peak periods congested. Currently about 12 million journeys are made on the subway everyday. By 2020, the city predicts daily ridership will increase to over 18.5 million journeys a day. A ¬•3 minimum fare that rises according to the distance travelled applies to all lines, except the Capital Airport Express (¬•25) and the Daxing Airport Express (¬•10 - ¬•35). The electronic commuter fare card, Yikatong is accepted on all lines. =Beijing Suburban Railway= The Beijing Suburban Railway, a suburban commuter train service, is managed separately from the Beijing Subway. The two systems, although complementary, are not related to each other operationally. Beijing Suburban Railway is run as part of the Beijing Railway Bureau. There are 3 suburban railway lines currently in operation: Line S2, Sub-Central line and Huairou‚ÄìMiyun line. =Bus, Trolleybus and BRT= The Beijing Public Transport Holdings, Ltd. (\\"BPT\\") is the main bus and trolleybus operator in the city.

Taxi Taxi fares depend on the vehicle type: these start at CNY 13 for the first 3 kilometers, and go up by CNY2.30 per extra kilometer; the per-kilometer charge is based upon the make and model of the vehicle. After 10pm the base fare goes up by 20%. Idling time is also factored into the total fare, which is CNY2.30 (CNY4.60 during rush hours of 07:00‚àí09:00 and 17:00‚àí19:00) per 5 minutes of standing or running at speeds lower than . All legal cabs will be part golden yellow or all black in color, and display their permits and paperwork on the dash board and windshield. There are also many illegal cabs known as (heiche, meaning 'Black Cabs' as in \\"black market\\" or \\"illegal\\"), which operate via a pre-negotiated fare. Taxi- like services, including Pedicabs, are also widely used. A motorized or manual bicycle is probably the most commonly seen form, although pedicabs are still available in certain parts of the city. These quaint modes of transport also employ the pre-negotiated fare system In 1999, the environmentally unsound \\"bread cars\\" (Minivans) (mianbao che, a.k.a. miandi) were decommissioned in a stringent manner. They used to charge CNY 1 per kilometre. Although it was sound, budget-wise, their poor environmental record and an increasing consciousness of the image of the capital were the factors that landed them in the dumpster. As of 2004, 1.20 RMB/km taxicabs were phased out, and as of 2006 all taxi fares were 2.00 RMB per km with the same 10 RMB starting fare for 3 km rule. The Hyundai Elantra is the common new type of taxi, along with the Volkswagen Jetta CiF. Intercity transportation = Air = Beijing Capital International Airport Beijing has two of the world's largest airports. The Beijing Capital International Airport (IATA: PEK) located northeast of the city center in Chaoyang District bordering Shunyi District, is the second busiest airport in the world after Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. Capital Airport's Terminal 3, built during the expansion for the 2008 Olympics, is one of the largest in the world. Capital Airport is the main hub for Air China and Hainan Airlines. The Airport Expressway and Second Airport Expressway, connects to Capital Airport from the northeast and east of the city center, respectively. Driving time from city center is about 40 minutes under normal traffic conditions. The Capital Airport Express line of Beijing Subway and the Capital Airport Bus serves the Capital Airport. Beijing Daxing International Airport The Beijing Daxing International Airport (IATA: PKX) located south of the city in Daxing District bordering the city of Langfang, Hebei Province, opened on September 25, 2019. The Daxing Airport has one of the world's largest terminal buildings and is expected to be a major airport serving Beijing, Tianjin and northern Hebei Province. Daxing Airport is connected to the city via the Beijing‚ÄìXiong'an intercity railway, the Daxing Airport Express line of the Beijing Subway and two expressways. Other airports With the opening of the Daxing Airport in September 2019, the Beijing Nanyuan Airport (IATA:NAY), located south of center in Fengtai District, has been closed to civilian airline service. Other airports in the city at Liangxiang, Xijiao, Shahe and Badaling are primarily for military use.

It is isomorphous with the iron-rich end-member, fayalite. Forsterite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system (space group Pbnm) with cell parameters a 4.75 √Ö (0.475 nm), b 10.20 √Ö (1.020 nm) and c 5.98 √Ö (0.598 nm). Forsterite is associated with igneous and metamorphic rocks and has also been found in meteorites. In 2005 it was also found in cometary dust returned by the Stardust probe. In 2011 it was observed as tiny crystals in the dusty clouds of gas around a forming star.Spitzer sees crystal 'rain' in outer clouds of infant star, Whitney Clavin and Trent Perrotto, Physorg.com, May 27, 2011 . Accessed May 2011 Two polymorphs of forsterite are known: wadsleyite (also orthorhombic) and ringwoodite (isometric). Both are mainly known from meteorites. Peridot is the gemstone variety of forsterite olivine. Composition Orange forsterite with a portion of tephroite Pure forsterite is composed of magnesium, oxygen and silicon. The chemical formula is Mg2SiO4. Forsterite, fayalite (Fe2SiO4) and tephroite (Mn2SiO4) are the end-members of the olivine solid solution series; other elements such as Ni and Ca substitute for Fe and Mg in olivine, but only in minor proportions in natural occurrences. Other minerals such as monticellite (CaMgSiO4), an uncommon calcium-rich mineral, share the olivine structure, but solid solution between olivine and these other minerals is limited. Monticellite is found in contact metamorphosed dolomites. Geologic occurrence Forsterite-rich olivine is the most abundant mineral in the mantle above a depth of about ; pyroxenes are also important minerals in this upper part of the mantle. Although pure forsterite does not occur in igneous rocks, dunite often contains olivine with forsterite contents at least as Mg-rich as Fo92 (92% forsterite ‚Äì 8% fayalite); common peridotite contains olivine typically at least as Mg-rich as Fo88.Deer W.A., Howie R.A., and Zussman J. (1992). An introduction to the rock-forming minerals (2nd ed.). Harlow: Longman . Due to its high melting point, olivine crystals are the first minerals to precipitate from a magmatic melt in a cumulate process, often with orthopyroxenes. Forsterite-rich olivine is a common crystallization product of mantle-derived magma. Olivine in mafic and ultramafic rocks typically is rich in the forsterite end-member. Forsterite also occurs in dolomitic marble which results from the metamorphism of high magnesium limestones and dolomites. Nearly pure forsterite occurs in some metamorphosed serpentinites. Fayalite-rich olivine is much less common. Nearly pure fayalite is a minor constituent in some granite-like rocks, and it is a major constituent of some metamorphic banded iron formations. Structure, formation, and physical properties Forsterite is mainly composed of the anion SiO44‚àí and the cation Mg2+ in a molar ratio 1:2. Silicon is the central atom in the SiO44‚àí anion. Each oxygen atom is bonded to the silicon by a single covalent bond. The four oxygen atoms have a partial negative charge because of the covalent bond with silicon. Therefore, oxygen atoms need to stay far from each other in order to reduce the repulsive force between them. The best geometry to reduce the repulsion is a tetrahedral shape. The cations occupy two different octahedral sites which are M1 and M2 and form ionic bonds with the silicate anions. M1 and M2 are slightly different. M2 site is larger and more regular than M1 as shown in Fig. 1\\\\. The packing in forsterite structure is dense. The space group of this structure is Pbnm and the point group is 2/m 2/m 2/m which is an orthorhombic crystal structure. Fig. 1: The atomic scale structure of forsterite looking along the a axis. Oxygen is shown in red, silicon in pink, and Mg in blue. A projection of the unit cell is shown by the black rectangle. This structure of forsterite can form a complete solid solution by replacing the magnesium with iron. Iron can form two different cations which are Fe2+ and Fe3+. The iron(II) ion has the same charge as magnesium ion and it has a very similar ionic radius to magnesium. Consequently, Fe2+ can replace the magnesium ion in the olivine structure. One of the important factors that can increase the portion of forsterite in the olivine solid solution is the ratio of iron(II) ions to iron(III) ions in the magma. As the iron(II) ions oxidize and become iron(III) ions, iron(III) ions cannot form olivine because of their 3+ charge. The occurrence of forsterite due to the oxidation of iron was observed in the Stromboli volcano in Italy. As the volcano fractured, gases and volatiles escaped from the magma chamber. The crystallization temperature of the magma increased as the gases escaped. Because iron(II) ions were oxidized in the Stromboli magma, little iron(II) was available to form Fe-rich olivine (fayalite). Hence, the crystallizing olivine was Mg-rich, and igneous rocks rich in forsterite were formed. Molar volume vs. pressure at room temperature At high pressure, forsterite undergoes a phase transition into wadsleyite; under the conditions prevailing in the Earth's upper mantle, this transformation would occur at pressures of ca. 14‚Äì15 GPa.D.

Ahrens, AGU Reference Shelf vol. 2, American Geophysical Union, Washington, D.C., pp. 248‚Äì268 In high-pressure experiments, the transformation may be delayed so that forsterite can remain metastable at pressures up to almost 50 GPa (see fig.).

Collected near Peridot, Arizona. Forsterite was first described in 1824 for an occurrence at Mount Somma, Vesuvius, Italy. It was named by Armand L√©vy in 1824 after the English naturalist and mineral collector Adolarius Jacob Forster.http://minrec.org/labels.asp?colid=726 Mineralogical Record, Biographical Archive.

National Geographic Channel was criticized for their association with the Boy Scouts of America, an organization which, until a vote in May of that year that overturned its ban, had forbidden openly gay members. Archaeologists have protested that National Geographic shows such as Diggers and Nazi War Diggers promote the looting and destruction of archaeological sites by promoting the work of metal detecting souvenir hunters and collectable dealers. In 2013 the National Geographic Channel set off a firestorm of controversy with its reality show Diggers. Professional archaeologists from the Society for Historical Archaeology, the largest scholarly group concerned with the archaeology of the modern world (A.D. 1400‚Äìpresent), roundly criticized the network for promoting the theft of cultural materials on public and private land. The show Nazi War Diggers was accused of showing unscientific and disrespectful handling of human remains. A promotional quote from a military relic dealer, \\"I feel that by selling things that are Nazi-related and for lots of money, I am preserving things that museums don't want to deal with,\\" was removed from the channel's website in March 2014. National Geographic expressed regret for how the series was presented by its own website but maintained that many of the accusations against the series were based on misinformation. The show was repackaged, amid controversy, as Battlefield Recovery for air during 2016 on Channel 5 in the UK.

Example of command-line completion in PowerShell with Intellisense. Command-line completion (also tab completion) is a common feature of command- line interpreters, in which the program automatically fills in partially typed commands. Command line interpreters are programs that allow a user to interact with the underlying operating system by typing commands at a command prompt using a command line interface (CLI), in contrast to pointing and clicking a mouse in a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Command-line completion allows the user to type the first few characters of a command, program, or filename, and press a completion key (normally ) to fill in the rest of the item. The user then presses or to run the command or open the file. Command-line completion is useful in several ways, as illustrated by the animation accompanying this article. Commonly accessed commands, especially ones with long names, require fewer keystrokes to reach. Commands with long or difficult to spell filenames can be entered by typing the first few characters and pressing a completion key, which completes the command or filename. In the case of multiple possible completions, some command-line interpreters, especially Unix shells, will list all possible completions beginning with those few characters. The user can type more characters and press again to see a new, narrowed-down list if the typed characters are still ambiguous, or else complete the command/filename with a trailing space. An alternate form of completion rotates through all matching results when the input is ambiguous. Completable elements may include commands, arguments, file names and other entities, depending on the specific interpreter and its configuration. Command-line completion generally only works in interactive mode. That is, it cannot be invoked to complete partially typed commands in scripts or batch files, even if the completion is unambiguous. The name tab completion comes from the fact that command-line completion is often invoked by pressing the tab key. History Tab completion showed up early in computing history; one of the first examples appeared in the Berkeley Timesharing System for the SDS 940, where if a typed string were ambiguous, the interpreter would do nothing, but if the string was not ambiguous, it would automatically complete it without any command from the user. This feature did not work well with the all too frequent typos, and so was a mixed blessing. This feature was imitated by Tenex's developers who made an important change: Tenex used \\"escape recognition\\", in which the interpreter would not attempt to autocomplete unless the escape key was struck (thus the name) by the user. The domain was also expanded from only program names on the Berkeley system to both program names and files on Tenex. The Tenex descendant TOPS-20 moved command line completion from command interpreter to the operating system via the COMND JSYS system call, to make it available to other user applications.DECSYSTEM-20 Assembly Language Guide From there it was borrowed by Unix. Example To open the file with Firefox one would type: firefox introduction-to-command-line-completion.html This is a long command to type. Instead we can use command-line completion. =Prompting completion= The following example shows how command-line completion works in Bash. Other command line shells may perform slightly differently. First we type the first three letters of our command: fir Then we press and because the only command in our system that starts with \\"fir\\" is \\"firefox\\", it will be completed to: firefox Then we start typing the file name: firefox i But this time is not the only file in the current directory that starts with \\"i\\". The directory also contains files and . The system can't decide which of these filenames we wanted to type, but it does know that the file must begin with \\"introduction- to-\\", so the command will be completed to: firefox introduction-to- Now we type \\"c\\": firefox introduction-to-c After pressing it will be completed to the whole filename: firefox introduction-to-command-line-completion.html In short we typed: firic This is just eight keystrokes, which is considerably less than 52 keystrokes we would have needed to type without using command-line completion. =Rotating completion= The following example shows how command- line completion works with rotating completion, such as Windows's CMD uses. We follow the same procedure as for prompting completion until we have: firefox i We press once, with the result: firefox introduction-to-bash.html We press again, getting: firefox introduction-to-command-line-completion.html In short we typed: firi This is just seven keystrokes, comparable to prompting-style completion. This works best if we know what possibilities the interpreter will rotate through. Completion in different command line interfaces *Unix shells, including Bash (the default shell in most Linux distributions and Mac OS X) and ksh among many others, have a long-standing tradition of advanced and customizable completion capabilities. ** Bash programmable completion, \`complete\` and \`compgen\` commands have been available since the beta version of 2.04 in 2000 and offers at least Pathname and filename completion. ** For Korn shell users, file name completion depends on the value of the EDITOR variable. If EDITOR is set to vi, you type part of the name, and then ,. If EDITOR is set to Emacs, you type part of the name, and then ,. ** The Z shell (zsh) pioneered the support for fully programmable completion, allowing users to have the shell automatically complete the parameters of various commands unrelated to the shell itself, which is accomplished by priming the shell with definitions of all known switches as well as appropriate parameter types. This allows the user to e.g. type }} and have the shell complete only tarred gzip archives from the actual filesystem, skipping files which are incompatible with the input parameters. A modern zsh installation comes with completion definitions for over five hundred commands. ** Tcsh offers default file, command, and variable name completion activated using . The 'complete' builtin command provides fully programmable completion. The source code comes with a 'complete.tcsh' file containing many examples of its completion syntax. *Windows PowerShell, the extensible command shell from Microsoft, which is based on object-oriented programming and the Microsoft .NET framework, provides powerful and customizable completion capabilities similar to those of traditional Unix shells. *The command processor of Windows NT-based systems supports basic completion. It is possible to use a separate key-binding for matching directory names only. * enables file and directory name completion characters (^F and ^D by default). Use for more information. *TweakUI can be used to configure the keys used for file name and directory name completion. *The MS-DOS command processor did not have command-line completion: pressing the tab key would just advance the cursor.

Geared towards children aged 7‚Äì14, the channel broadcasts original animated series from sister network Nickelodeon, known as Nicktoons, along with other original animated series, some feature films, and foreign animated programs from Nickelodeon's international networks 24 hours a day. As of September 2019, approximately 70 million American households (51.3% of households with television) received Nicktoons. History Nicktoons Network typeface, (2005‚Äì09) In 1991, Nicktoons was originally launched as a programming block on Nickelodeon, airing animated series. The block lasted until 2002. Nicktoons was launched as a standalone channel on May 1, 2002, as Nicktoons TV, part of the digital cable-exclusive MTV Digital Suite, in order to entice cable operators to pick up the network and give them a marketing advantage over satellite services. However, by early 2004, Nickelodeon management changed course and offered it to digital satellite services DirecTV and Dish Network. The network was originally marketed as commercial-free, with comedic promos involving Nickelodeon Animation Studios, two-minute cartoon shorts from foreign markets, and former program promotions which had previously been used on Nickelodeon taking up commercial time. By June 6, 2005, as the network's distribution increased, the network began to carry regular advertising. On September 28, 2009, the network's logo changed as part of Nickelodeon's universal rebranding effort that also saw Nickelodeon's first logo change in 25 years, and name changes for sister networks: The N to TeenNick and Noggin to Nick Jr.Nickelodeon Unveils New Logo, Variety.com, July 29, 2009 An HD feed was launched on August 13, 2013, and is available on several providers. Like Viacom's other HD channels, any programming produced in 4:3 SD is pillarboxed on this feed. As the network has blended in more Nickelodeon programming into its schedule, the Nicktoons website was sunsetted, recommending viewers go to Nick.com instead before eventually being fully redirected to the Nick.com domain. Programming Despite the channel's name, Nicktoons is not exclusively limited to airing Nicktoons, Nickelodeon's branding for its original animated television series (a brand that has seldom been used by Nickelodeon itself since the launch of the Nicktoons channel). The channel has engaged in channel drift throughout its existence, increasingly adding action-oriented programming that was never seen on Nickelodeon, and even live-action programs in recent years (despite the channel's name being called Nicktoons). Like sister network TeenNick (previously The N), it is also used as a 'burn off' channel for failed or low- rated series (mainly animated) previously ordered for and airing on the main Nickelodeon network, along with outside series popular in overseas markets where Viacom is required to purchase worldwide rights for, but are not expected to rate well in the United States. =NickSports= On September 3, 2014, a two-hour Wednesday prime time programming block named NickSports was launched on the channel, tying into the Kids' Choice Sports inaugurated that year. The block presented mainly licensed programming focusing on sports, including the Rob Dyrdek-starring Wild Grinders and NFL Rush Zone: Guardians of the Core, along with sports-related feature films such as Bend It Like Beckham, Cool Runnings, and Space Jam. Sometime in 2015, the block was moved to a Friday prime time slot. The block ended in September 2018.

His military and diplomatic efforts in Egypt were a key factor in establishing the Ayyubid family in that country. Name Shirkuh is a Persian and Kurdish name which literally means \\"the lion (of the) mountain\\". Shirkuh is also the name of several villages in modern day Iran. His Arabic honorific Asad ad-Din similarly means \\"the lion of faith\\". In Latin, his name was rendered as \\"Siraconus\\"; William of Tyre, referring to the expedition of 1163, describes him as: > an able and energetic warrior, eager for glory and of wide experience in > military affairs. Generous far beyond the resources of his patrimony, > Shirkuh was beloved by his followers because of this munificence. He was > small of stature, very stout and fat and already advanced in years.

He was the son of Shadhi ibn Marwan, a Kurdish ruler, and the brother of Najm ad-Din Ayyub, the ancestor of the Ayyubid dynasty.Lane Poole, Stanley, The Mohammedan Dynasties, Constable & Co. London 1894 p.77 The family was closely connected to the Shaddadid dynasty, and when the last Shaddadid was deposed in Dvin in 1130, Shahdi moved the family first to Baghdad and then to Tikrit, where he was appointed governor by the regional administrator Bihruz. Ayyub succeeded his father as governor of Tikrit when Shahdi died soon after. When Shirkuh killed a Christian with whom he was quarrelling in Tikrit in 1138,Ibn Khallikan's Biographical Dictionary, vol.4, trams. Bn. Mac Guckin de Slane, Edouard Blot, Paris 1871 p.483 the brothers were exiled (Shirkuh's nephew Yusuf, later known as Saladin, was supposedly born the night they left). They joined Nur ad-Din Zengi's army, and Shirkuh served under Nur ad-Din Zengi who succeeded Zengi in Mosul. Shirkuh was later given Homs, ar-Rahba and other appanages by Nur ad Din Zengi as his vassal.Ibn Khallikan's Biographical Dictionary, vol.4, trams. Bn. Mac Guckin de Slane, Edouard Blot, Paris 1871 p.484 Ayyub served as governor of Baalbek and later Damascus, and the two brothers negotiated the surrender of Damascus to Nur ad- Din in 1154. In 1163 Nur ad-Din was asked by Shawar to intervene in Egypt in a dispute between him and Dirgham over the Fatimid vizierate. Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh, and this was to be the first of three ventures Shirkuh made into Egypt, nominally on Nur ad-Din's behalf. On this first occasion, his nephew Saladin accompanied him as an advisor. Shawar was restored and Dirgham was killed, but after quarrelling with Shirkuh, Shawar allied with Amalric I of Jerusalem, who marched into Egypt in 1164 and besieged Shirkuh at Bilbeis Ibn Khallikan's Biographical Dictionary, vol.4, trams. Bn. Mac Guckin de Slane, Edouard Blot, Paris 1871 p.486 (see Crusader invasion of Egypt). In response Nur ad-Din attacked the Crusader states and almost captured the Principality of Antioch. Later career Shirkuh was invited back into Egypt by the Fatimid Caliph Al-'ƒÄ·∏çid in 1167, to help defeat the Crusaders who were attacking Cairo.First Encyclopedia of Islam, E. J. Brill, Leiden 1993, vol. 7 p.382 Shawar once again allied with Amalric, who besieged Shirkuh in Alexandria until he agreed to leave; however, a Crusader garrison remained in Egypt and Amalric allied with the Byzantine Empire, planning to conquer it entirely. To destroy the garrison, Shawar switched alliances, from Amalric to Shirkuh. The Muslims fought a pitched battle with the Crusaders, who did not have the resources to conquer Egypt and were forced to retreat. Shirkuh and his associates enjoyed widespread support among the civil elite In Egypt for religious reasons. Although the Fatimid rulers were Shiite, the majority of people remained Sunni Muslims.Lev, Yaacov, Saladin in Egypt, Koninklijke Brill, Leiden 1999 p.78 In January 1169 Shirkuh entered Cairo and had the untrustworthy Shawar executed. When he reached Cairo with his armies he was welcomed by the Fatimid Caliph Al-'ƒÄ·∏çid and treated with great honour.Lane- Poole, Stanley, Saladin and the Fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, The Other Press, Kuala Lumpur 2007 p.86 He accepted the office of vizier, but died two months later on March 22; as Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad describes, \\"it was the case that Asad ad-Din was a great eater, excessively given to partaking of rich meats. He suffered many bouts of indigestion and from quinsy, from which he would recover after putting up with great discomfort. He was taken severely ill, afflicted with a serious quinsy, which killed him on 22 Jumada II 564 [22 February 1169].\\" Legacy He was succeeded as vizier by his nephew Saladin, who had served with him on his campaigns in Egypt. Saladin eventually succeeded Nur ad-Din as well, uniting Egypt and Syria, which enabled him to almost completely drive out the crusaders from Syria and Palestine. A number of historians have offered the view that Shirkuh's death was an important factor in allowing Saladin to consolidate his position as Sultan and as undisputed head of the Ayyubid family.Ibn Khallikan's Biographical Dictionary, vol.4, trams. Bn. Mac Guckin de Slane, Edouard Blot, Paris 1871 p.492 Although Nur ad-Din Zengi took back the domain of Homs on Shirkuh's death, in 1179 Saladin gave Homs to Shirkuh's son Muhammad ibn ShirkuhRunciman S. Hunyadi Z., Laszlovszky J., The Crusades and the Military Orders: Expanding the Frontier of Medieval Latin Christianity, CEU Medievalia, 2001,p.62 and his descendants continued to rule in Homs thereafter until the death in 1263 of his last descendant the emir, Al-Ashraf Musa, Emir of Homs. After this Homs was ruled directly as part of the Mamluk empire. References Sources *Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad, The Rare and Excellent History of Saladin, ed. D. S.

The Sultanate separated from Sultanate of Deli after a dispute over the royal throne in 1720. Like other kingdoms on the east coast of Sumatra, Serdang prospered because of the opening of tobacco, rubber and oil palm plantations. In 1943 the Japanese beheaded Tengku Rachmadu'llah, a member of the royal family of the Sultanate of Serdang. History =Establishment of the Sultanate of Deli= According to history, an Laksamana from Sultan Iskandar Muda Aceh named Sri Paduka Gocah Pahlawan, have a title Laksamana Khoja Bintan, married to the younger brother of Raja Urung (state) Sunggal, a Karo Tribal area that already converted to Islam. Then, by the 4 Kings of the Urung Karo tribe who were already Muslim, this Laksamana was appointed king in Deli in 1630. With that event, the Kingdom of Deli was officially established, and the Laksamana became the first Deli King. In the coronation process of the Deli King, King Urung Sunggal was in charge as Ulun Jandi, namely to say obedience from the Big Men and people to the king. Then, the Datuk Empat Institution was formed, and Raja Urung Sunggal was a member of the Datuk Empat Institution. =Crisis= In its development, in 1723 there was chaos when Tuanku Panglima Paderap, the 3rd Raja Deli died. This crisis happened because the eldest son of the King who was supposed to replace him had a defect in his eyes, so he could not become king. Son number 2, Tuanku Pasutan who was very ambitious to become king then took over the throne and expelled his younger brother, Tuanku Umar with his mother, Permaisuri Tuanku Puan Sampali, to Serdang region. According to Malay custom, Tuanku Umar was supposed to replace his father as the Deli King, because he was the son of garaha (permaisuri), while Tuanku Pasutan was only a concubine. However, because he was still a minor, Tuanku Umar was finally eliminated from the Deli. To prevent civil war from happening, the 2 Great Men of Deli, namely Raja Urung Sunggal and Raja Urung Senembal, together with an East Urung Batak King in the upstream Serdang region (Tanjong Merawa), and an official from Aceh (Lumu Kejeruan), then rationing Tuanku Umar as the first Serdang King in 1723. Since then, the Serdang Kingdom has been established as a fraction of the Deli Kingdom.

Chadstone Shopping Centre is the biggest shopping centre in Australia and claims to be the biggest in the Southern Hemisphere.McCauley, Dana. (22 September 2016). \\"Inside Melbourne‚Äôs new and improved Chadstone Shopping Centre\\". News.com.au. Retrieved 12 October 2016. The centre opened on 3 October 1960 and was the first self-contained regional shopping centre in Melbourne. The centre contains 129,924m2 of shop floor space, about 530 stores and more than 9300 free car parking spaces. It has as many as 68,000 visitors on its busiest trading days and attracts about 400,000 tourists a year from interstate and 200,000 from overseas. Sales at the centre exceed $1.4 billion‚Äîthe highest turnover of all Australian shopping centres‚Äîand it has more than 20 million visitors annually. The centre, also known colloquially as \\"Chaddy\\", includes anchor stores such as the Myer and David Jones department stores, H&M;, Zara and UNIQLO (opened late 2016 as part of a renovation), Coles, Woolworths and Aldi supermarkets, as well as Kmart and Target discount department stores, JB Hi-Fi, and more than 500 specialty stores, of which the majority are fashion-related, including numerous high-end labels like Dior, Chanel, Pandora, Tiffany & Co and More. Also located in the centre is a Tesla Dealership and Legoland Discovery Centre Plus a Lego Store and Hoyts Cinemas. There are two food courts, two office towers located at the southern side of the centre and a newly built hotel. The centre's owners had sought a further expansion to include a 250-room hotel and 15,000m2 of offices (including its owner Vicinity Centres Head Office), to take total floor space to 221,217m2, including 156,924m2 of shop floor space.

History =Origins= An aerial photograph of the area in which Chadstone Shopping Centre now stands, in 1945, with the current centre perimeter shown in red. GF shops in first major expansion area Opened in October 1960 at a cost of ¬£6 million, Chadstone Shopping Centre was the first self-contained regional shopping centre in Melbourne, and the largest built in Australia to that time. The centre was built and owned by the Myer Emporium, and marked the transformation of shopping in Australia from the traditional central city and strip-shopping precincts to the now familiar mall-type shopping centre.Hutson (1999), page 17 The site of the current shopping centre was once extensive paddocks of the Convent of the Good Shepherd on which cattle grazed until the mid-1950s. The initial of land was sold to Myer in March 1958.Hutson (1999), page 24 The development of Chadstone was driven by Ken Myer, who in 1949 looked to the US for the lead in retail developments, with decentralised centres fuelled by expanding suburban growth and car reliance.Hutson (1999), page 18 Further development of the concept occurred after Myer's 1953 visit to the US, where he met with a number of architects involved with the design of shopping malls, and in 1954 Myer secured of land in Burwood for a shopping centre. The Burwood site was ultimately not used for the project.Hutson (1999), page 22 In 1958 the American firm of Welton Becket and Associates was appointed as the design architect, with Tompkins and Shaw Architects as the production architect. During the project the senior board of Myer was unhappy with the process, concerned that the architects did not understand the \\"Australian Concept\\", and were blindly adopting the American shopping mall model. In 1960 the Myer board wrote:Hutson (1999), page 25 :\\"Although based in a broad way on the pattern of shopping centres in the United States, Chadstone has been individually designed to suit local needs and its own location.\\" The original shopping centre consisted of a single open-air mall with Myer at the southern end and a Dickins New World supermarket at the northern end; following the US pattern of shopping malls. =Early years= Atrium completed in 1980s The first major change was made to the centre in the 1970s or 1980s: the mall was roofed over with translucent fibreglass, an acknowledgement that the open mall did not suit the Melbourne climate. During the same period a bowling alley and auditorium were opened, and the Dickens store was altered to be more easily accessed from the mall.Hutson (1999), page 27 In the early 1980s, the Myer Emporium sold the shopping centre to the Gandel Group, which has since managed and developed the complex. In 1984 the centre had its first major expansion: in 1985 now Coles New World was relocated into a new mall and a Target Discount Department Store was relocated from downstairs to a new store where Coles used to be, and in 1986 a Hoyts 8 Cinema Complex was opened. A major extension doubled the lettable area in the late 1980s, and during the same era the Convent of the Good Shepherd was demolished to extend the carpark of the complex. =Redevelopments= GF shops to Chadstone SC Bus Interchange LG Level Shops corridor Chadstone has reclaimed the title \\"Southern hemisphere's largest shopping centre\\" since 2009 and also \\"Australia's largest shopping centre\\" since 2007, thanks to regular development. Westfield Knox held the latter title from November 2002 until 2007 after the completion of their own expansion works. Chadstone initially held both of these titles from its original opening day to 2002 and was quickly inspired to take back the records. Chadstone's main local rivals are Westfield Doncaster to the north, Westfield Knox to the east and Westfield Southland to the south. Pre-2007 Throughout the 1990s, Chadstone had undergone numerous developments. These include the development of multi-storey carparks due to the boundaries of the centre being built-up with no further room to expand. Approximately 20% of the original mall structure is left intact with this number to be reduced due to the construction of the West Mall. By 1999 Chadstone's lettable area covered 126,000m2, after the extension of the Myer and David Jones stores. Part of stages 20 and 21, this expansion cost $150 million and took two and a half years to complete. Local construction company Probuild has been responsible for every major stage of expansion and redevelopment at Chadstone Shopping Centre, commencing at stage 5 in 1989, with stage 33 (West Mall) having been completed in 2009. 2007-2009 In December 2007 a A$100 million upgrade saw the centre's owners extend Chadstone's lettable area to 171,217 m2, with the centre reclaiming the title as the largest shopping centre in Australia. Interior view of the centre, prior the 2007-2009 extension. The new extension, dubbed \\"Chadstone Place\\", featured a Woolworths Supermarket (the first Woolworth supermarket in Victoria to have the new branding and relocated), First Choice Liquor, Aldi and a Dick Smith Electronics Concept Store along with an airport-style waiting area bus interchange, two new health clubs (Contours and Fitness First Platinum) and a cr√®che. On 29 October 2007 the first section of the redevelopment was open. Named \\"The Loop Mall\\", it featured 44 new stores including a redesigned Jetty Surf and new entrances opposite Kmart and Toys 'R' Us. The last major redevelopment, commencing in early 2007, impacted on almost a quarter of the centre, (the oldest section of the centre, from Sportsgirl to Mrs. Field's/Borders, being closed), from 31 May 2008, until November 2009. The development also included redesigning the roads leading into Chadstone to allow for better traffic flow into the centre. As part of the development an independent community group launched and maintained a website to keep track of construction developments.Chadstone Development Forum The State Government refused to impose a condition sought by the Stonnington Council calling for a transport study by the Government and Gandel, including the possible construction of a rail link. On 22 August 2009, 50 new stores, including Sportsgirl, Portmans, Esprit, Witchery, were opened. In November, a golden strip of luxury retailers were officially opened. Twelve international fashion houses now have stores at Chadstone including Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada, Chanel, Miu Miu, Tiffany & Co., Ralph Lauren, Hugo Boss, Omega, Burberry, Coach and Jimmy Choo. The expansion provided a total of 530 stores. The completed section of the 2007-2009 extension. 2011-present GF shops Extension area Food Court Level 1 Restaurants On 20 August 2011, managing director of Colonial First State Global Asset Management, Darren Steinberg, announced a proposal to expand Chadstone's floor area to 221,217m¬≤, to enable a redevelopment of the oldest part of the property to the north and construct two buildings of up to 14 storeys on its southern boundary facing Princes Highway. Up to 60,000 m2 of floor area would be revamped and an extra 27,000 m2 added to the centre. The proposal includes refurbishments of the cinemas and food precincts. An extra 1400 car-parking spaces are proposed for the centre, taking total car spaces to 10,708. The project, scheduled to be completed in late 2015 at a cost of A$520 million, will be the biggest non- retail extension in the centre's history. The redevelopment plans were supported by an independent planning panel in July 2012 and approved by the City of Stonnington on 14 August 2012. On 10 November 2012, the centre's redevelopment plans were given the final approval from the State Government. The CFS Retail and Gandel Group boards gave the go-ahead for part of the works in May 2014, which would add 34,000 square metres to a total of 212,000 sq m. The west mall would be \\"revitalised\\" with an expanded luxury section, while work at the northern end would create a new retail and leisure precinct accommodating a Hoyts digital cinema complex, up to five international flagship stores in 11,000 sq m of space, 40 new retailers and a 1300-seat, 26-tenant food gallery. The northern expansion, including a new Target store on the lower ground floor, would be accommodated within a four-level glass- roofed atrium. The expansion would also include a 17,000 sq m 10-level office tower, new bus interchange and an additional 800 car park spaces, taking total car spaces to 10,090. The new northern extension would create \\"racecourse\\" style malls running around the centre on both the Ground and Lower Ground floors. Demolition began in June 2014 and construction in September 2014, with staged openings through to completion on 13 October 2016. This extension opened in October 2016, and was marketed as \\"The New Chadstone\\". The renovated section includes many global brands such as H&M;, Sephora, UNIQLO, and many others Legoland Discovery Centre indoor theme park was later announced to open as part of the new development. This is the first Lego themed attraction for Merlin Entertainments in the Southern Hemisphere. It opened on 18 April 2017.http://www.smh.com.au/business/property/australian-legoland-discovery- centre-to-open-at-chadstone-mall-20150819-gj2r6c.html Construction on the 250-room M Gallery by Sofitel hotel began in May 2018 with completion expected in late 2019. Chadstone Shopping Centre extension Revenue and profit Chadstone Shopping Centre was the first shopping centre in Australia to have its total worth valued at more than A$1 billion. Chadstone Shopping Centre's net income was $970 million in 2004. Its annual profit in (2004) was A$79.03 million, with its entirety of stores gaining an income of A$119.23 million. In 2004, Chadstone Shopping Centre had an Annual Traffic Movement of 16.7 million moving through the centre. In 2007, the annual turnover was A$1 billion, making it the shopping centre in Australia with the highest annual turnover and the first to have an annual turnover of A$1 billion. In 2010, Chadstone had a 20% increase in the moving annual turnover (MAT), making A$1.28 billion in sales that year. The centre reported an annual turnover for 2013 of $1.4 billion, an increase of 3 percent on the previous year, making it the shopping centre with the highest turnover in Australia. The next biggest was Westfield Bondi Junction, with $1 billion turnover. As of 2013, the centre's value exceeds A$3 billion.John Gandel, Stan Perron and Sir John Pidgeon join 2012 inductee Westfield‚Äôs Frank Lowy in Property Council‚Äôs hall of fame. Property Observer. 20 May 2013 Transport and road congestion The 'Chadstone Corner' entrance in 2007, one of the main entrances which at the time was flanked by bus stops. Chadstone Shopping Centre was designed as a car-based centre when this was the norm and it remains highly dependent on cars for customer access. The centre has more than 9300 car parking spaces and the proportion of staff and customers arriving by car continues to grow: between 2002 and 2011 the share of customers arriving by bus fell sharply from 17% to 12%, while the proportion of those walking or cycling fell from 5% to 3%. Planners now acknowledge it would be a major challenge to reverse the trend. The independent planning panel that in 2012 reviewed Stonnington Council's proposed C154 planning scheme amendment relating to Chadstone's expansion plans said the centre contributed to \\"significant traffic issues\\" in the area, with traffic on nearby major arterial networks heavily congested and intersections \\"close to saturated at peak times\\". The panel's report said problems also arose from overflow parking in nearby streets at peak times such as Christmas and major sales, and that the local community had expressed concerns that future growth at Chadstone would worsen the problem. The panel concluded that the ability to further expand floor space would be limited unless road capacity was enhanced through major arterial roadworks and a substantial shift in the mode of transport for visitors and staff. Traffic congestion also impacts on the 14 bus routes that service the shopping centre,https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/news-and-events/news/new-chadstone-bus- interchange/ including two higher frequency SmartBus routes (Routes 900 and 903). Buses often take 15 minutes to travel to or from Holmesglen, 1.8 km away. The Public Transport Users Association (PTUA), which is campaigning for improved public transport in and around the centre, says buses are slow, often travelling less than in the area and are often overcrowded.\\"Chadstone transport woes spur new group\\", Public Transport Users Association website Services for many bus routes are infrequent after hours and on weekends. The nearest railway stations are at Hughesdale and Oakleigh on the Cranbourne/Pakenham lines and Holmesglen and East Malvern on the Glen Waverley line. Hughesdale station is about 20 minutes' walk from the shopping centre; Holmesglen is about 30 minutes. Submissions to the 2012 planning panel by the PTUA and Town and Country Planning Authority (TCPA) supported an extension of the Alamein railway line to Oakleigh railway station via Chadstone for either light or heavy rail services and the RACV has also asked the state government to consider providing an underground rail link. Stonnington Council has proposed a Municipal Strategic Statement and Local Planning Policy in which it would seek a fixed rail link to Chadstone Shopping Centre.City of Stonnington Revised Municipal Strategic Statement and Local Planning Policy Framework C161, Clause 21.07-2, section 4.5 State government transport authority Public Transport Victoria also views a rail link to Chadstone as desirable, but says the cost of building one would be \\"prohibitive\\". Tenants Chadstone Shopping Centre has 211,929m¬≤ of floor space, comprising 550 stores over four levels serviced by over 10,000 car spaces. The major retailers, which are located at either end of the centre, include David Jones, Myer, H&M;, Sephora, Uniqlo, Zara, Muji, Apple, Target, Kmart, Woolworths, Coles, Aldi, Rebel Sport, JB Hi-Fi, Legoland Discovery Centre and Hoyts Cinema.

It is approximately north east of Leeds city centre. Harehills is situated between the A58 (towards Wetherby) and the A64 (towards York). It sits in the Gipton & Harehills ward of Leeds City Council and the Leeds East parliamentary constituency.  Overview  Harehills is situated between Burmantofts and Gipton, and adjacent to Chapeltown. Its boundaries are defined by the city council as \\"the boundary of Spencer Place to the West, Harehills Avenue to the North, the boundary of Foundry Place to the East and Compton Road and Stanley Road to the South.\\" As the name suggests it is a hill area, basically a south- facing slope, with many streets of terraced houses on hills. In the middle is Banstead Park, a grassy slope with trees and play areas, giving a view over the city of Leeds. Banstead Park was home to rioting in 2001. Along with neighbouring Chapeltown, Harehills has suffered from rioting and sporadic unrest. The cheaper housing has made it attractive to immigrants, with the result that it has a considerable cultural and ethnic mixture. There are two main shopping streets, Harehills Lane and Harehills Road which join at the junction of Roundhay Road (A58 road) leading to Oakwood. Also, heading up Harehills Lane towards the A64 York Road at the junction with Compton Road, is Harehills's other main shopping area. Official Government figures have listed Harehills as the 429th most deprived of England‚Äôs 8,414 electoral wards ‚Äì in the top 5%. Unemployment in Harehills is at 9%, compared to less than 4% across the City of Leeds. IMPaCT is a community partnership which aims to improve the Chapeltown and Harehills areas. St James' University Hospital is situated in Harehills. On the August Bank Holiday the Leeds Carnival is held with a procession through Harehills and Chapeltown. Etymology The name Harehills is first attested in 1576, as Hayr Hylls. Scholars agree that the second element of the name Harehills is the topographic term 'hill'. There has been some debate about the first element, however. Eilert Ekwall, in his influential Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names, thought that the name came from the Old English word hƒÅr ('grey').Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names, 4th edn (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1960). However, the subsequent research by A. H. Smith for the English Place-Name Society concluded that, as the modern spelling would suggest, the name does originate from hare, and thus originally meant 'hill characterised by the presence of hares'.A. H. Smith, The Place-Names of the West Riding of Yorkshire, English Place-Name Society, 30‚Äì37, 8 vols (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1961‚Äì63).Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place- Names Society, 2017), p. 51.  History  Bayswater Avenue in 1953 By 1850, Leeds had grown through industrialisation, to the North, South and West, however there was a particular lack of development to the East of the city. The existing villages did not seem to stimulate any suburban growth in this area. The mining activity to the East of the city also failed to stimulate growth. At this time there was open countryside only a mile from Briggate. The building of the Leeds tramway along York Road and Roundhay Road began to stimulate some growth, and by the time of the production on the 1906 Ordnance Survey Map, Harehills was an established community. At this time Harehills was home to a purpose built reservoir, owned by the Leeds Corporation Water Works. There were also by this time two large textile factories on Hudson Road, as well as two large brick works, The Harehills Brickworks and the Gipton Brickworks (the latter being on Darfield Road in Harehills and not in Gipton as the name would suggest), there was the York Road Iron Works as well as a few farms, which were quickly redeveloped. Harehills and the surrounding area also had significant mining infrastructure, with collieries at York Road, Killingbeck, Neville Hill, Osmondthorpe and Burmantofts. However none of these collieries survived beyond the 1960s. Throughout the second half of the Twentieth century, coal was generally brought from Rothwell, Castleford and Pontefract. Until 1900 the tramways on York Road were pulled by horses, however in 1900 they were electrified. This improved transportation and stimulated further growth around Harehills, Burmantofts and Osmondthorpe. The location of St James' Hospital also stimulated growth in the area. The Hospital quickly grew to be one of the city's main hospitals, and is now the largest in Yorkshire. Ashley Road and Darfield Crescent By the 1960s, the mining and textile industry in Harehills was dwindling and the area was particularly run down. This led to the development of new housing, particularly around the hospital, such as the building of the Shakespeare high rise flats. Most of Harehills stayed the same, and even now, most of the Victorian terraces and back to backs still stand. Most of the council development around East Leeds was in new communities such as Gipton, Seacroft, Halton Moor, Swarcliffe and Whinmoor. Throughout the latter decades of the twentieth century Harehills' industrial areas generally declined and have been converted into car garages, light warehouses, self-storage centres and such. Low rental prices coupled with the fact that most could not qualify for a council house attracted many commonwealth immigrants to Harehills, throughout the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Harehills now has significant Asian and Afro-Caribbean communities. Crime and deprivation continue to be an issue in Harehills. Racial tension has caused problems in the area, resulting in rioting in 2001. In 1984, some terraced houses in the area around the roads \\"Sandhurst Terrace\\", \\"Dorset Road\\", \\"Dorset Mount\\" and \\"Dorset Avenue\\" appeared in the beginning of rock band Queen's music video for \\"I Want To Break Free\\".  Amenities  Harehills' amenities are not located within one centre but spread across the area, mainly on Roundhay Road and Harehills Lane. Harehills Lane is a traditional shopping street with many individual shops and a library. Harehills Conservative Club is a large brick building on Harehills Lane, and Harehills Liberal Club is round the corner on Foundry Approach. The area's largest supermarket, Kwiksave on Roundhay Road recently closed and was replaced by a local supermarket. There is a Co-op, a Farmfoods, a small Sainsbury's, an Asda Supermarket, a Morrisons and a large continental supermarket on Roundhay Road. There are also a great many individual shops frequently aimed at the various immigrant communities, as can be seen by shop signs in languages other than English. Harehills is home to many different fast food shops, and Roundhay Road has been referred to as 'The Curry Mile'. There are several public houses in Harehills, although considerably fewer than there once were. This has been partly ascribed to the increase in the Muslim population, who do not drink alcohol. Pubs remaining in Harehills include Delaney's Irish Bar, and the Samuel Smiths pub, The Brown Hare. There is Nightingale Primary Academy and Harehills Primary School. There are no secondary schools actually in Harehills but many situated close by.  Transport  tramway along Roundhay Road in Harehills Harehills is situated between the A58 and the A64. It has no form of public transport other than the numerous bus routes that run through various parts of the district. It was formerly on the Leeds Corporation Tramways network and was on a proposed route of the Leeds Supertram before its cancellation. However it was to gain another light transit system, if its inclusion on the Leeds Trolleybus came to fruition. The location of St James' University Hospital prompted the inclusion of Harehills in the projects, however the Trolleybus plans were cancelled in May 2016 because it was claimed that they would have provided little value for money. In 1949 Tetley's Coaches, a local coach operator, was founded in Harehills. However, since then the coach operator has moved its offices to Hunslet. Harehills is well placed for access to Leeds city centre and Wetherby. Buses run through Harehills to Leeds city centre, Oakwood, Roundhay, Gipton, Seacroft and Wetherby. Buses running through Harehills are operated by First Leeds, while other infrastructure is maintained by West Yorkshire Metro. =Buses= Harehills is served by four bus services on the 'Leeds Overground' (frequent bus services identified by a schematic colour-coded map similar to that used on the London Underground). The Orange line runs along the A58 Roundhay Road, linking Harehills with Seacroft, Leeds city centre and Horsforth. The Purple line also runs along Roundhay Road linking Harehills with Seacroft, Leeds city centre and Bramley. The Blue line runs along Roundhay Road linking Harehills with Oakwood, Roundhay and Leeds city centre. The Mauve line runs along Harehills Lane, linking Harehills with Fearnville, Gipton, Leeds city centre and Farnley.  Religion  The area has at least eight places of worship, indicative of the changing population of the area, with an Anglican church being the oldest and a mosque the most recent.Harehills 2008 Hufton et al. Religious Mapping of Leeds, University of Leeds Dept of Theology and Religious Studies The oldest is St Aidan's, the Anglican parish church, a Victorian brick building, noted for its Frank Brangwyn mosaics. It was completed in 1894, and is on Roundhay Road, on the south side of Banstead Park. The vicar of St Aidan's Church, Alan Taylor, is also (2010) a Leeds City Councillor.democracy.leeds.gov.uk/ Councillor Alan Taylor Another Anglican Church is St Wilfrid's on Chatsworth Road, a 1927 brick building, part of the Forward in Faith movement. The Roman Catholic parish church is St Augustine's, a 1937 brick building on Harehills Road, a little to the north of Banstead Park. On Banstead Terrace, the north side of Banstead Park is the Trinity United Church a 1983 brick building.Trinity United Webpage It combined congregations from a Methodist and two United Reformed Churches in the area. On Harehills Lane is the Baptist Church, a 1928 brick building Foundation Stone and the Jamia Masjid Bilal Mosque built in 1996 to serve the local Pakistani community, but now having a much more diverse congregation of recent immigrants. On Easterly Road an old school building is (since 1988) home to the New Testament Church of God, a Pentacostal congregation of mainly African or Afro-Caribbean origin. The only Greek Orthodox Church in Leeds is The Three Hierarchs, in a former Methodist Church (1906 stone building) on Harehills Avenue, which attracts worshippers from all over Yorkshire.

Harehills has a poor reputation in the Leeds area, as does neighbouring Chapeltown and most of East Leeds. Harehills was subject to sporadic rioting in 2001, however there has been no unrest on such a scale since. The Fforde Grene Public House had a poor reputation and has since been closed down and is now a continental supermarket. Racial motives were cited as the reason for the rioting, a claim which the West Yorkshire Police said was a poor excuse for legitimising criminal behaviour. Harehills also has problems with drug dealing and gun crime.  Negative publicity  =2002 BBC report= The area has been subject to much bad press over the years. In 2002, the BBC interviewed local residents. One resident described Harehills as \\"a horrible place to live\\" and complained about joy riding, rubbish, drug dealing, arson and vermin. The man's report went on to say: \\"Often you will see a group of young children chasing vermin into an overgrown backyard. This is a sight you would expect to see in a third-world country not the modern, vibrant city that Leeds portrays itself to be.\\" Another resident described it as being a pleasant place until the 1970s, but has since changed 'beyond recognition'. However a third interviewed resident was more positive, although critical in her report, and echoing many of the complaints before, she mentions the 'pride of the residents in the upkeep of their houses'. =Yorkshire Evening Post= The Yorkshire Evening Post has reported on numerous crimes in Harehills. Most articles regarding Harehills are regarding serious crime in the area, including assault, robbery and shootings. From June to August 2008, the Yorkshire Evening Post reported on four serious assaults including one murder (including the use of firearms). The Yorkshire Evening Post has also reported on the poor state of public space in Harehills.  Regeneration  Street sign in Harehills In October 2003, Harehills received ¬£100,000 toward regeneration from Yorkshire Forward. Leeds City Council have also invested in the area. Investment has also included a new children's centre. A feature of the community effort is a number of colourful mosaic street signs, made by youths who are residents of Harehills. Over the past years residents and local agencies, have come together and organised community events, the Harehills Festival and improvements to the local library to include a one-stop shop for the Leeds City Council.

Its best known artists were Lonnie Donegan (1956‚Äì1969), Petula Clark (1957‚Äì1971), The Searchers (1963‚Äì1967), The Kinks (1964‚Äì1971), Sandie Shaw (1964‚Äì1971), Status Quo (1968‚Äì1971) and Brotherhood of Man (1975‚Äì1979). The label changed its name to PRT Records in 1980, before being briefly reactivated as Pye Records in 2006. History The Pye Company originally manufactured televisions and radios. Its main plant was situated off what used to be Haig Road, in Cambridge, and it entered the record business when it bought Nixa Records in 1953. In 1955, the company acquired Polygon Records, a label that had been established by Petula Clark's father and Alan A. Freeman to control distribution of her recordings, and merged it with Nixa Records to form Pye Nixa Records. =Pye International= In 1958, Pye International Records was established. The company licensed recordings from American and other foreign labels for the UK market, including Chess, A&M;, Kama Sutra, Colpix, Warner Bros., Buddah, Cameo, 20th Century, and King. It also released recordings from British artist Labi Siffre which were produced outside the company. =Expansion= In 1959, Pye Nixa became Pye Records and ATV acquired 50% of the label. ATV bought the other half of the business in 1966. The company entered the budget-priced album market in 1957, reissuing older Pye material on Pye Golden Guinea Records, priced at a guinea (one pound and one shilling). A series of classical recordings was released on Golden Guinea Collector, for example an influential version of Handel¬¥s \\"Music for the Royal Fireworks\\" in 1959. This featured the conductor Charles Mackerras who made other recordings on the label including a Janacek compilation. The orchestra credited for the Music for the Royal Fireworks was the Pro Arte Orchestra, but given the number of extra players used it was effectively an ad hoc ensemble on that occasion. It was closed in the seventies and was eventually replaced by Marble Arch Records, selling at an even lower price. Pye also offered a series of \\"4D\\" quadraphonic albums, using the Sansui QS matrix system. =Piccadilly and Dawn labels= Another, full- price, subsidiary, Piccadilly Records, was for new pop acts, including Joe Brown & the Bruvvers, Clinton Ford, the Rockin' Berries, Sounds Orchestral, the Sorrows, Jackie Trent and, later on, the Ivy League. In 1969, Pye launched a less mainstream label for folk, jazz, blues and progressive acts, Dawn Records. The label artists included Mungo Jerry, Donovan, Comus, Titus Groan and Trifle. =As PRT Records= When the rights to the name Pye (then owned by Philips) expired in 1980, the label changed its name to PRT, which stood for Precision Records and Tapes, via a brief flirtation with Precision. At that time, it had sub-labels such as Fanfare Records, a late 1980s and early 1990s UK-based Hi-NRG label issuing records by Sinitta, R&B; Records, a 1980s disco/electro label featuring Imagination, and Splash Records, which featured Jigsaw and the Richard Hewson Orchestra/RAH Band. PRT provided manufacturing and distribution for Gary Numan's label Numa Records, founded in 1984, which went on to release two dozen singles by a variety of acts alongside its eponymous founder, including actress Caroline Munro. Postman Pat songs and music, from the television series of the same name, were recorded at PRT Studios. PRT's parent company ACC was purchased by the Bell Group of Australia in 1982. In 1988 the Bell Group was purchased by the Bond Corporation. However, the Bond Corporation was suffering financial problems itself and proceeded to quickly sell of most of its assets. PRT's record and cassette factory was sold to another record manufacturer, Meekland. The masters of PRT's catalogue were sold to Castle Communications, which eventually became Sanctuary Records (now a division of BMG Rights Management). Precision Records & Tapes Ltd, formerly Pye Records Ltd, was officially liquidated in December 2013. =Brief revival= In July 2006, Pye Records was reactivated by Sanctuary Records as an indie and alternative label, featuring artists such as Scottish alternative rock group Idlewild. However, plans for continued usage of the Pye name were abandoned when Universal Music Group bought Sanctuary in 2007. To fulfil conditions imposed by the European Commission following UMG's acquisition of EMI in 2012, Universal sold Sanctuary to BMG Rights Management in 2013. =Current ownership= Warner Music Group, through its Alternative Distribution Alliance division, controls the catalogue of reissues from Pye/PRT artists' releases on Sanctuary's behalf after BMG assigned ADA to distribute them in March 2017. =ATV Music Publishing= Pye Records was a sister company to the better known ATV Music Publishing. This company, which owned Beatles publisher Northern Songs, was bought by Michael Jackson in 1985 and later merged with Sony to form Sony/ATV Music Publishing. International divisions =Pye in the US= Starting with the \\"British Invasion\\" of 1964, Pye placed their artists in the US mostly on labels that they distributed in the UK: the Kinks to Cameo Records and then to Reprise Records, David Bowie, the Sorrows and Petula Clark to Warner Bros. Records, Donovan to Hickory Records, the Searchers to Mercury Records, Liberty Records, and finally Kapp Records, and Status Quo to Chess Records (which issued their records on their newly created Cadet Concept Records label). From 1969 to 1971, Pye was a co- owner with GRT (General Recorded Tape) of Janus Records, which at the outset served as the US label for such Pye acts as Jefferson, Sounds Orchestral, Pickettywitch, Mungo Jerry and Status Quo, and also re-issued the early (pre-1966) recordings of Donovan. Pye sold its share of Janus back to GRT in 1971. In 1972, Bell Records set up a short-lived Pye label, featuring Michel Pagliaro, a Canadian artist whose first English-language album was issued on UK Pye (largely recorded in England), and Jackie McAuley, whose lone solo album was originally issued on UK Dawn. In 1974, Pye established an American version of its record label. The label was not a success, however, and closed its US operations in 1976. The head of the US division, Marvin Schlachter, then started Prelude Records, named after one of Pye's acts of the time, Prelude; its initial LP and 45 catalogue series were carried over from the ill-fated American Pye label (with the catalogue prefix changed from PYE- to PRL-), and Prelude had a string of disco and dance music hits into the early 1980s. =Pye in Canada= Whilst Pye did not have its own operations in Canada, it arranged with Canadian record companies to issue Pye recordings on the Pye label in Canada. Before then, Quality Records issued Pye recordings on the Quality label. Their earliest Pye Canada releases such as Lonnie Donegan's \\"My Old Man's A Dustman\\" were distributed by Astral Music Sales. Around 1963, distribution shifted to Allied Record Corporation. In 1968 distribution shifted to Phonodisc. =Quadraphonic= In the 1970s there was a short period of quadraphonic records. Pye was one of the few labels who chose the QS Regular Matrix system which was created by Sansui.

Founded in 1146, the abbey was abandoned in 1796. Most of the site has since fallen into ruins. History In 1146, 12 Cistercian monks and three lay brothers from Clairvaux came to Villers in order to establish the abbey on land granted them by Gauthier de Marbais. After establishing several preliminary sites (Villers I and Villers II), work was finally undertaken in the 13th century to build the current site. The choir was constructed by 1217, the crypt by 1240, and the refectory by 1267. The church itself took 70 years to build and was completed by the end of the century. Villers Abbey ruinsDuring this period, the abbey reached the height of its fame and importance. Contemporary accounts suggest that roughly 100 monks and 300 lay brothers resided within its walls, although this is possibly an exaggeration. The lands attached to the abbey also expanded considerably, reaching some 100 km¬≤ of woods, fields, and pasturage. Decline set in during the 16th century, tied to the larger troubles of the Low Countries. Spanish tercios, during the campaign of 1544, did considerable damage to the church and cloister, both of which were partially restored in 1587. In the early 17th century, Cris√≥stomo Henr√≠quez wrote the history of the abbey. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the abbey's fortunes continued to diminish. The number of monks and the abbey's wealth dwindled, and it was finally abandoned in 1796 in the wake of the French Revolution. Burials * Henry II, Duke of Brabant * Sophie of Thuringia, Duchess of Brabant * John III, Duke of Brabant * Gobert of Aspremont * Juliana of Li√®ge After dissolution Villers Abbey church ruins Further degradation to the site occurred in 1855, when the railway line between Leuven and Charleroi passed through the old abbatial grounds. In 1893, the Belgian state purchased the site and launched a conservation effort. Classed as an official historic site in 1973, the abbey has subsequently enjoyed considerable restoration, and the remains of the abbey along with numerous outbuildings can still be seen, including the cloister, refectory, kitchens, dormitories, and brewing house. Since 1992, the site has been maintained by the Association pour la Promotion Touristique et Culturelle de Villers (APTCV). The church, although in ruins, is an outstanding example of Cistercian architecture, with imposing vaulting, arches, and rose windows. The abbey now hosts an annual choir festival \\"Nuit Des Choeurs\\" in which a number of choirs sing a variety of music - classical through to gospel, jazz and pop arrangements - from different parts of the grounds over successive nights, culminating in a fireworks display and centre stage concert.

The company established offices in both Los Angeles and Tulsa, Russell's home town, where the label sought to promote a \\"workshop atmosphere\\" with a recording studio in a converted church, adjoining houses for artists working at the studio, and other facilities.Bob Kirsch, \\"3-Year-Old Shelter has 2 home bases\\", Billboard, November 10, 1973. The Tulsa recording studio was housed in the historic The Church Studio. Russell remained with Shelter until 1976, when he and Cordell fell out.Irwin Stambler, Grelun Landon, Lyndon Stambler, Country Music: The Encyclopedia (St. Martin's Press, 2000), , p.424. Excerpt available at Google Books. In a settlement, Cordell then became sole owner of the label, while Russell left to start his own label, Paradise Records. In addition to Russell, the label signed other talents, such as Tulsa Sound artists J. J. Cale, Dwight Twilley Band and the Gap Band, as well as Alan Gerber, Jesse Barish (of Jesse, Wolff and Whings), Don Nix, Freddie King, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, Phoebe Snow, Richard Torrance and Eureka, Willis Alan Ramsey, and the Grease Band. Shelter Records also released \\"Duppy Conqueror\\", the first American single by reggae artist Bob Marley.\\"Denny Cordell, 51, Record Producer\\", New York Times, February 25, 1995. Distribution history Shelter Records was originally distributed by Blue Thumb Records, but then it was distributed by Capitol/EMI from 1970 until 1973. During this time, the label was red with an egg on top with an inverted Superman logo on the egg. This logo did not sit well with DC Comics, and they sued Shelter for trademark infringement.\\"Shelter sued by Superman\\", Billboard, September 11, 1971. Shelter then blacked out the Superman logo on subsequent releases until the distribution deal ran out with Capitol/EMI. Afterwards, the Shelter logo was replaced by an egg with a hand- scrawled \\"S\\" on it. From 1974 until 1975 (sporting a yellowish label and their new logo), Shelter was then distributed by MCA Records. Afterwards from 1975 to 1977, the label was distributed by ABC Records (the first label being yellow; the second one was reddish-orange with the Shelter egg inside a Saturn-style ring with a crescent man-in-the-moon at the bottom of the label). In 1977, Shelter transferred distribution to Arista (principally for the Dwight Twilley Band), but the rights to Tom Petty and J. J. Cale were retained by ABC. Shelter continued as an active label until 1979, when ABC was sold to MCA. MCA released one more album using the Shelter label (a J.J. Cale album), then all remaining Shelter recordings held by ABC were put on another MCA subsidiary entitled Backstreet Records. The Shelter/Arista deal terminated in 1981, which was the effective end of Shelter Records. Shortly after the label's demise, the catalog was purchased by Dunhill Compact Classics (later known as DCC), which reissued several Shelter catalog LPs and compilations. DCC (which issued mostly compilation CDs mostly licensed from other labels, many remastered by respected recording engineer Steve Hoffman) later went out of business. During 1993, the Shelter catalogue was bought out by Capitol/EMI, and their imprint The Right Stuff reissued many titles (except for Tom Petty and J. J. Cale albums, as the Tom Petty Shelter albums are controlled by Petty's estate and currently distributed by Rhino, owned by the Warner Music Group, also owners of Petty's former label Reprise Records, and the J. J. Cale Shelter albums are controlled by Universal Music Group, the successor to MCA). In the United Kingdom, records on the Shelter label were distributed by Island Records in the late 1970s.

Originally from Perth, Western Australia, she attended the rowing program at the Western Australian Institute of Sport, and later represented Australia at the women's four at the 2000 Olympics and the women's eight at the 2004 Olympics. At the 2004 Olympics she stopped rowing due to exhaustion during the final part of the race, for which she was heavily criticised. After the conclusion of her rowing career, Robbins attempted to become a professional cyclist. Biography Robbins was born in Perth, Western Australia, and attended Melville Senior High School. She began rowing at the age of 13, and attended the Western Australian Institute of Sport. Robbins was involved in an infamous incident in the 2004 Olympics final held on 22 August. The team was third through the first 1000 metres but had dropped to fifth position with 500 metres remaining, three seconds behind the Romanian crew in first position.// World Rowing - Official Website // During the final 400 metres Robbins, who was physically exhausted, dropped her oar, allowing it to drag in the water, gave up and lay back on teammate Julia Wilson's lap. Australia, consequently, finished last, ten seconds behind the fifth place crew. Robbins was accused of mental weakness and publicly ridiculed in the Australian media as \\"Lay-down Sally\\". The Daily Telegraph reported:The Age: Robbins drops oar, team drops bundle > \\"In a team sport such as rowing what she did was unforgivable. It appears > Robbins committed the greatest crime there is in honest sport: she quit.\\" Even then Australian Prime Minister John Howard became involved in the row, saying:ABC News: Rowers face censure for dumping on Robbins > \\"I'm not taking sides but it's always regrettable, it's tough and there's a > lot of pressure. It's always a good idea to bind together but look, I wasn't > there and I can understand the passion the emotion and the effort that goes > into these things and the sense of disappointment people feel.\\" This was not the first time Robbins had been involved in such an incident. In the women's quad scull at the 2002 World Rowing Championships in Seville, Robbins had also dropped her oar, costing Australia certain victory. 2000 Summer Olympics silver medallist Rachael Taylor was quoted as saying:Sydney Morning Herald: They said they'd throw me off the boat > \\"Australia was blitzing the race, leading the entire field all the way.

Records was an American record label founded by Miles Copeland III, Jay Boberg, and Carl Grasso in 1979.Billboard.biz, \\"IRS Records to be Relaunched by EMI, Crush Management\\", The Hollywood Reporter, June 15, 2011 I.R.S. produced some of the most popular bands of the 1980s, and was particularly known for issuing records by college rock, new wave and alternative rock artists, including R.E.M., The Go-Go's, Wall of Voodoo and Fine Young Cannibals. History Miles Copeland III, the son of CIA agent Miles Copeland Jr., played many roles in the U.K. punk rock and new wave music industry of the middle to late 1970s: agent, manager, producer, magazine publisher, record company and label owner. His brother Ian was the head of a talent agency, Frontier Booking International (F.B.I.), while his brother Stewart played drums for The Police, a band that Copeland managed. The Police's first album was released on A&M; Records in 1978 with a hit single, \\"Roxanne\\", that Copeland called a turning point in his life. Building on success with the Police, Copeland convinced Jerry Moss, co-owner of A&M;, to establish the I.R.S. division in 1979. I.R.S. stood for International Record Syndicate. From 1983 to 1987, I.R.S. Records sponsored a monthly MTV show called I.R.S. Records Presents The Cutting Edge, hosted by Peter Zaremba of The Fleshtones. The series concentrated on bands that recorded for the label. The show concept would later evolve into the alternative rock program 120 Minutes, which was launched in 1986 and co-existed with Cutting Edge for about a year and a half. I.R.S. releases were distributed by A&M; until 1985, then by MCA Records until 1990, and by EMI until the label folded in 1996. In 1985, Copeland brokered a deal to switch the label's distributor to MCA Records. Under the agreement, A&M; continued to release the label's pre-1985 catalog, much of which still can be found under the A&M; banner. The label folded in May 1996, with its last release being All Set by the Buzzcocks, issued two weeks before the closure. Shortly after, Copeland formed Ark 21 Records. In 2011, EMI revived the label; as of 2012, the new label had Chiddy Bang and Foxy Shazam on its roster. In October 2013, shortly after the integration of EMI into its successor, Universal Music Group, the label was revived again as I.R.S. Nashville, with Striking Matches, Marc Scibilia and Cowboy Jack Clement on its roster before being shut down once again in 2015. Faulty Products labels Faulty Products was the UK holding company for I.R.S. Records of the UK record labels set up by Copeland. It included Illegal Records, Deptford Fun City Records and others. Faulty Products was also an American independent record label and distribution company for other indie labels between 1980 and 1982. Faulty handled artists that didn't go through I.R.S.'s distribution deal with A&M.; Illegal Records was set up by Miles Copeland with his younger brother Stewart and the manager of The Police, Paul Mulligan. The label released The Police's debut single, \\"Fall Out\\". Deptford Fun City Records was set up by Miles Copeland in the late 1970s as an outlet for Deptford, England bands such as Alternative TV and Squeeze. I.R.S. No Speak, also known as No Speak Records, was set up as an all-instrumental imprint of I.R.S. in January 1988. It released albums by Stewart Copeland, Wishbone Ash, and William Orbit. Tribal America was a label run by Rob DiStefano that was distributed by I.R.S. from 1991 until IRS folded in 1996. It concentrated on house music, a type of electronic dance music. The most prominent releases on its roster were by the production team Murk and also the song \\"So Get Up\\" an iconic vocal poem by Californian rapper Ithaka, backed by the Progressive house sounds of USL from Lisbon, Portugal. DiStefano went on to found Twisted America Records. Roster I.R.S.'s roster of musicians included The Alarm, Bangles, Berlin, Black Sabbath, Buzzcocks, J. J. Cale, Belinda Carlisle, Concrete Blonde, Stewart Copeland, The Cramps, Dada, The Damned, Dead Kennedys, The English Beat, The Fall, Fine Young Cannibals, The Fleshtones, General Public, The Genitorturers, The Go-Go's, Head, Jools Holland, Klark Kent, Let's Active, The Lords of the New Church, Magazine, Gary Numan, Oingo Boingo, R.E.M., Renaissance, Scott Merritt, Stan Ridgway, Skafish, The Stranglers, Timbuk 3, Torch Song, Wall of Voodoo, and YEN. Sales certifications I.R.S.

In contrast with generic GIS formats, GDF provides detailed rules for data capture and representation, and an extensive catalog of standard features, attributes and relationships. The most recent extension expanded applicability further towards pedestrian navigation, 3-D map rendering, and advanced driver- assistance systems (ADAS). GDF is commonly used for data interchange in many industries such as automotive navigation systems, fleet management, dispatch management, road traffic analysis, traffic management, and automatic vehicle location. Originated as a flat plain-text file, GDF is not intended to be used directly for any large scale geographic application and normally requires conversion into a more efficient format. Consumability has been increased with most-recent developments for XML and SQL renditions. The maps in GDF format are provided by many map vendors such as HERE, TomTom, Mapscape BV, GeoSmart, Automotive Navigation Data, AutoNavi and NavInfo. Standardisation GDF is an international standard that is used to model, describe and transfer road networks and other geographic data. The standard was initially drawn up by CEN in co-operation with digital map providers, automotive and electronic equipment manufacturers. The outcome of these standardisation efforts (CEN GDF 3.0, or ENV14825:1996) has formed the major input to a global standard created by ISO/TC204 Sub Working group 3: * ISO GDF 4.0, formally referred to ISO14825:2004, now replaced by * ISO GDF 5.0, formally referred to ISO14825:2011. However, despite the existence of an ISO GDF standard, the nature of model abstractions as well as semantic interpretations and proprietary content extensions lead to interoperability issues between flavors of GDF map products from different vendors. In practice the GDF files are not fully interchangeable due to vendor specific extensions. To this end, GDF5.0 provides major improvements in terms of extended meta data and flags for signalling implementation choices. =The new GDF5.0= The specifications of GDF5.0 were developed and compiled between 2001 and 2008, involving experts from Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Japan, Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, and the United States of America. Extensive activities towards harmonization with ISO/TC211 standards were undertaken. GDF 5.0 was published in July 2011. Major GDF5.0 enhancements include UML model migration & refinements; harmonization with linear referencing and geo-spatial web standards; support for 3-D content and time coordinates; comprehensive character set and phonetic representations; and new XML and SQL based delivery formats. =Background and rationale of GDF standardization= By the late 1980s, producers and users of digital road map data became increasingly aware of the need for a common data interchange standard. Lack of such a standard was seen as an impediment to the commercial growth and success of industries using such data. Before the advent of the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) industry, development of spatial data interchange standards was done mostly on a regional basis and not designed for the specialised requirements of road transport-related applications. In the 1990s, the GDF standard was instrumental in enabling the European business-to-business (B2B) market for in-vehicle navigation in that it provided interoperability for exchanging digital map data between map manufacturers and navigation system integrators. The GDF specifications provided a base for both the capturing of geographic content and the exchanging of it. Its original design foresaw a powerful, application-independent model, while its initial rendition as a standard specifically addressed the requirements for the richness of navigable map databases. Since then, GDF has evolved in terms of data modelling capabilities, broadened international applicability, expanded geographic domains, and diversified exchange formats. As a result, GDF covers a wide range of application domains and has been adapted to many geo-spatial technologies.

Management operations on digital assets =Creation= Applications implement digital asset management by importing them from the analog and/or digital domains (by encoding, scanning, optical character recognition, etc.) or by authoring them as new objects. =Indexing= A primary function of a DAM system is to make assets easily available to its users by providing a searchable index that supports retrieval of assets by their content and/or metadata. The cataloging function is usually part of the ingestion process for new assets. =Workflow= Digital assets will typically have a lifecycle, which may include various states such as creation, approval, live, archived and deleted. =Version control= Often a DAM system will store earlier versions of a digital asset and allow those to be downloaded or reverted to. Therefore, a DAM system can operate as an advanced type of version control system. =Access control= Finally, a DAM system typically includes security controls ensuring relevant people have access to assets. This will often involve integration with existing directory services via a technology such as single sign-on.  Terminology  The term \\"media asset management\\" (MAM) may be used in reference to DAM applied to the sub-set of digital objects commonly considered \\"media\\", namely audio recordings, photos, and videos. Any editing process that involves media, especially video, can make use of a MAM to access media components to be edited together, or to be combined with a live feed, in a fluent manner. A MAM typically offers at least one searchable index of the images, audio, and videos it contains constructed from metadata harvested from the images using pattern recognition, or input manually.  Categorization  Smaller DAM systems are used in a particular operational context, for instance in video production systems. The key differentiators between them are the types of input encoders used for creating digital copies of assets to bring them under management, and the output decoders and/or formatters used to make them usable as documents and/or online resources. The metadata of a content item can serve as a guide to the selection of the codec(s) needed to handle the content during processing, and may be of use when applying access control rules to enforce authorization policy.* Assets that require particular technology to be used in a workflow need to have their requirements for bandwidth, latency, and access control considered in the design of the tools that create or store them, and in the architecture of the system that distributes and archives them. When not being worked on assets can be held in a DAM in a variety of formats including blob (binary large object in a database) or as a file in a normal file system, that are \\"cheaper\\" to store than the form needed during operations on them. This makes it possible to implement a large scale DAM as an assembly of high performance processing systems in a network with a high density storage solution at its centre.  Media asset issues  An asset can exist in several formats and in a sequence of versions. The digital version of the original asset is generally captured in as high a resolution, colour depth, and (if applicable) frame rate as will be needed to ensure that results are of acceptable quality for the end-use. There can also be thumbnail copies of lower quality for use in visual indexing. Metadata for an asset can include its packaging, encoding, provenance, ownership and access rights, and location of original creation. It is used to provide hints to the tools and systems used to work on, or with, the asset about how it should be handled and displayed. Types of systems Digital asset management systems fall into the following classifications: * Brand management system to enforce brand presentation within an organization by making the approved logos, fonts, and product images easily available. * Library or archive for bulk storage of infrequently changing video or photo assets. * Production management systems for handling assets being created on the fly for use in live media production or as visual effects for use in gaming applications, TV, or films. * Streaming for on-demand delivery of digital content, like TV shows or movies, to end users on behalf of digital retailers All of these types will include features for work-flow management, collaboration, project-management, and revision control.

Retrieved 3 December 2019.) was a New Zealand writer, producer and children's advocate. He lived in Auckland with his partner, artist Jean Clarkson. They have two grown children. Early career Baysting was born in Blenheim, and grew up in Nelson. From the 1990s onward, Baysting became well known for his advocacy of NZ music. Before this he worked as a journalist, scriptwriter and stand up comedian. In Australia, his children's songs, co- written with Peter Dasent, have become popular through the ABC show Play School and recordings by the singer and its host Justine Clarke. Early in his writing career Baysting was a journalist with the magazine NZ Listener and published Young New Zealand Poets (1973), an anthology of poetry. In 1977, Baysting (with Ian Mune) wrote the screenplay for Roger Donaldson's feature film Sleeping Dogs, a film credited with kick-starting the modern NZ film industry. He also collaborated with Donaldson on the series, Winners and Losers, and with Mune, on the children's television serial, The Mad Dog Gang. Career =1970s‚Äì1980s= Baysting and his partner became members of the alternative theatre group Red Mole for their seven-month season at Wellington's Carmen's Balcony. Baysting was the cabaret's MC and his character, Neville Purvis, became one of New Zealand's early stand up comedians. Purvis later starred in his own television series, The Neville Purvis Family Show. This ended controversially in 1979 with Purvis apologising for the bad language in the series and adding, \\"at least we never said f**k,\\" thereby becoming the first person to say the forbidden word on NZ television. Following complaints to the police, and media publicity around this event, free-lance work was scarce, and in 1980 Baysting and Clarkson moved to Sydney. While in Australia he was signed to Mushroom Music Publishing, later shifting administration of his repertoire to Origin Music. The couple moved back to NZ in 1985 where Baysting wrote scripts for the production company The Gibson Group, including the satirical sketch series Public Eye and the tele-feature Undercover (featuring a very young Cliff Curtis). contributed to the soundtrack of Peter Jackson's feature Meet The Feebles (1989). He worked for several years at the Auckland Medical School, with Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) and through this met Labour back-bencher Helen Clark and became her electorate press secretary. Later (with Dyan Campbell and Margaret Dagg) he edited Making Policy Not Tea (Oxford University Press), a book of interviews with women MPs. =1990s= For two years in the early 1990s, Baysting was President of the NZ Writers Guild and in 1992, he was elected NZ Writer/Director on the Board of the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), the body run by songwriters to license music and distribute music royalties. Over the next 18 years, as APRA director, Baysting became involved in a number of cultural initiatives, notably the Green Ribbon campaign. This brought together industry groups such as SPADA, APRA, the Writers Guild, the Director's Guild, WIFT, the Technicians Guild and others to collectively lobby politicians for better access for NZ programming. The 1999 Endangered Species conference bought in experts from Ireland and Australia and put the issue of local radio and television content on to the political agenda. Green Ribbon lobbied for more local content on television, for a 20% quota for NZ music on commercial radio, for a Music Commission and for a non-commercial national radio network for young people. They were successful with the first three objectives (although the 20% music quota is a \\"voluntary target\\"). The youth radio initiative was vigorously opposed by commercial radio and never eventuated. =2000s= In 2001, for his work with the Green Ribbon campaign, Baysting received the inaugural SPADA/On Film Industry Champion award. The campaign found an ally in Helen Clark who went on to become the first NZ Prime Minister to hold the arts portfolio and who ushered in a remarkable period in New Zealand's cultural growth. In the same year Baysting and Mike Chunn produced the Nature's Best collection of the top 30 songs voted for by APRA members and other music luminaries. Released by Sony Music, it became the largest-selling NZ compilation and was followed by several successful follow- up releases. In 2001 Baysting became co-director, with Cath Andersen, of the newly established Music Industry Commission. He later moved into the role of Project Director before leaving the NZMIC in 2006. In 2008, Baysting and his family travelled to Tahiti, where his partner Jean Clarkson was part of a group exhibition by women descendants of the Tahitians who sailed to Pitcairn Island with the Bounty mutineers. He made a documentary of this Tahiti visit, called The 'Ahu Sistas, which told the women's side of this famous story. He also co-wrote songs with Pitcairn Islander Meralda Warren for the CD Pitcairn Island Songs. In 2008, Baysting helped set up the annual APRA Children's Music Awards and in 2005/06 he was on the originating committee for the first New Zealand Ukulele Festival, now a popular annual event featuring over 3,000 young ukulele players. =2010s= In 2012, Penguin/Viking Australia published the children's book, The Gobbledygook is Eating a Book, written by Baysting and Justine Clarke. This was shortlisted for Best Children's Book in the Australian book awards and has since been translated and published in France.http://penguineducation.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/gobbledygook-is- eating-a-book-justine-clarke-arthur-baysting-and-tom-jellett/ Baysting became a respected songwriter working with many collaborators in a variety of genres. Artists who have recorded his songs include Al Hunter, Alex Papps, Anne Kirkpatrick, Bamboo, Beaver, Boh Runga, the Cafe at the Gate of Salvation, Che Fu, the Crocodiles, Chanelle Davis, Dragon, Fane Flaws, Forbidden Joe, Glenn Moffat, Hot Cafe, I Am Joe's Music, Jenny Morris (1980, \\"Tears\\"), King Kapisi, Kokomo, Linn Lorkin, the Living Hamsters, Marg Layton, Midge Marsden, Neville Purvis, Tony Backhouse and the Umbrellas. With his long-time collaborator Bill Lake he has written for the Pelicans and the Windy City Strugglers, Lake's country blues band, who have twice won Best Folk Album in the NZ music awards. Formed in 1968 the Strugglers were the subject of the 2008 Costa Botes documentary Struggle No More. In 2011, he and Strugglers' bass player Nick Bollinger produced Shoebox Love Songs, a CD of traditional Rarotongan love songs by Will Crummer, featuring his daughter Annie. In 2013 and 2014 he was a part-time carer for his friend, stroke survivor Chris Knox. At the 2013 Silver Scroll Awards, Lorde's producer and co-writer Joel Little paid tribute to Baysting for helping at various stages in his career beginning with a songwriting workshop at his school when Little was 10 years old.http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid;=11140589 In 2013, Justine Clarke's Little Day Out, featuring his songs won Best Children's Album at the Australian ARIA music industry awards. In 2014 he received a platinum record for 70,000 sales of Clarke's CD, I Like to Sing. He was a full-time songwriter and often did group songwriting workshops and mentoring with teachers and young musicians. In October 2018 he was presented with the Nostalgia Award from the Variety Artists Club of New Zealand for his contribution to New Zealand entertainment. Baysting died on 3 December 2019 after a period of illness. He reportedly had continued to write songs until the end of his life.

An election is a process in which a vote is held to elect candidates to an office. It is the mechanism by which a democracy fills elective offices in the legislature, and sometimes the executive and judiciary, and in which electorates choose local government officials. Georgia elects on national level a head of state - the president - and a legislature. The president is elected for a five-year term by the people. The Parliament of Georgia has 150 members, elected for a four-year term, 77 seats by proportional representation and 73 in single-seat constituencies. In the summer of 2019, protests in Georgia demanded a change to a more proportional system (removing the single- seat constituencies) and secured a promise from Georgian Dream party leader Bidzina Ivanishvili to do so. In November 2019, however, individual members of parliament voted against a bill to change the electoral system, sparking renewed protests. Statistics Since 1990, there have been 22 elections conducted in Georgia, of which five have been Presidential, seven have been Parliamentary, seven have been Supreme Council of Adjara, and four have been local; there has also been onr referendum and one plebiscite. The greatest recorded number of voters (3,594,810) participated in the presidential elections held on May 26, 1991; on this same occasion, the highest turnout was also recorded, at 2,978,247. The largest number of observers (1848 international and 13,195 local organisations) was registered by the CEC for Parliamentary Elections on May 21, 2008. =First multiparty elections = The very first independent multiparty elections in Georgia were held on October 28, 1990. Still the Soviet Republic, Georgia was firmly on its way to independence. The Soviet dictate, with its harsh rule, was about to end, illustrated by the first time multiparty elections were conducted. 14 political parties registered for these elections, which was held with a mixed system. The Supreme Council elected 250 (125 proportional, 125 majoritarian) MPs for five years. The total number of voters was 3444 thousand, 67% participated in this elections. Only four parties crossed the threshold and only two parties received mandates under the proportional system: # \\"Round Table-Free Georgia\\" (81 MPs) # The Communist Party of Georgia (44 MPs) # In the majoritarian system the places were distributed as follows: # \\"Round Table-Free Georgia\\" (43 MPs) # Competition (17 MPs) # People's Front (11 MPs) # \\"Democratic Georgia\\" (2 MPs) # Rustaveli Society (1 MP) As a result of the advice, \\"Round Table - Free Georgia\\" came to power. Electoral commissions of political unions, public associations and organizations, labor collectives, secondary special and higher education institutions of citizens of the Republic of Georgia contributed to the elections. The rest of the rules of holding the parliamentary elections were determined by the law of the Republic of Georgia. =First Presidential Elections= On April 14, 1991, the presidential regime was introduced into Georgia. The Elections were deemed to be conducted in case of participation of majority of total number of voters. Candidates whom were supported by more than 50% of the total number of voters were deemed elected. Six candidates participated in these elections: 1\\\\. Zviad Gamsakhurdia - 2,565,362 votes. 2.

Fotiou et al.Official acceptance of this broader definition is indicated by the fact that the NHS Chapeltown Health Centre is at its south- east junction, the corner of Spencer Place and Leopold Street. This is roughly the same as the boundary given in the Leeds Index of Deprivation, although the Scott Hall estate is excluded from Chapeltown. This follows the LS7 postcode boundary on the east, with LS8 being Harehills. Roundhay Road could also be considered the boundary between them. However, it is widely accepted that Markham Avenue and Gathorne Terrace are the dividing line between Chapeltown and Harehills.Chapeltown Community Church is in the LS8 postal district, just East of Potternewton Park. Harehills is adjacent, and the areas are commonly considered together. Neighbouring areas include Chapel Allerton to the north, Scott Hall to the west, Harehills to the east, Sheepscar to the south, and Potternewton either to the north or included. Taking the larger area, the main thoroughfare of Chapeltown is Chapeltown Road which passes through the centre of the area north‚Äìsouth for about , linking Sheepscar Interchange (at the edge of Leeds city centre) and Harehills Lane/Chapel Allerton. Spencer Place in the east is another through route, and once well known as a red light district although the area's popularity with prostitutes has reportedly recently declined. =Chapeltown and Potternewton= Public Art on Chapeltown Road The names \\"Chapeltown\\" and \\"Potternewton\\" have become virtually interchangeable for the same area. The civil parish that governed the area before the expansion of Leeds County Borough in 1904 was called \\"Potter Newton\\", and the name is still used by the Church of England for the ecclesiastical parish of St. Martin's Church. The Ordnance Survey also lists the name \\"Potternewton\\" rather than \\"Chapeltown\\". Royal Mail classifies the area around Oak Road and St Marys Close as Potternewton, but does not list any road as Chapeltown. However, Leeds City Council now uses the name \\"Chapeltown\\" to refer to the area. Potternewton Park Potternewton Park in the north-east of the area is the venue for Europe's oldest West Indian Carnival; Leeds Carnival. Norma Hutchinson Park, a smaller playground and sports field in the south of Chapeltown was previously named Buslingthorpe Recreation Ground and was renamed in 2009 to commemorate Jamaican-born local councillor who died in 2004. Potternewton Park Chapeltown =Transport= Chapeltown is served by bus services 2, 3, 3A and 36 which run directly via Chapeltown Road. The hourly service 48 does not operate in the evenings or on Sundays. Service 91 runs along Harehills Lane. =Schools= Potternewton Park Chapeltown Leeds Bracken Edge Primary School is on Newton Garth adjacent to Potternewton Park. It was rebuilt and extended in 2007. Hillcrest Primary School, off Cowper Street has hosted events such as PFS (playing for success). Holy Rosary and St Annes Catholic School is on Leopold Street. Leopold Primary School, closed by 2002 because of overcrowding, became the Chapeltown Children Centre. Chapeltown Community Nursery is on Reginald Street. History The name Chapeltown is in origin a reduced form, first attested in 1427, of Chapel Allerton, and once denoted the same place.A. H. Smith, The Place-Names of the West Riding of Yorkshire, English Place-Names Society, 30‚Äì37, 8 vols (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1961‚Äì63), iv, 138. Ralph Thoresby, writing in 1715, records Chapel-Town as a common name for the township of Chapel Allerton, describing it as \\"well situated in pure Air, upon a pleasant Ascent, which affords a Prospect of the Country ten or twelve miles\\". The open space to its east and north of Potter-Newton was \\"a delicate Green commonly call'd Chapel-Town Moor\\".Ralph Thoresby (1715) Ducatus Leodiensis: or, the topography of the ancient and populous town and parish of Leedes, and parts adjacent in the West Riding of York, pages 113, 124 Chapeltown Moor was in the manor of Newton (Potternewton), some 300 acres, used for races, archery contests, and in 1765 one of the first cricket matches in Yorkshire, between \\"the Gentlemen of Chapeltown and the Gentlemen of Sheffield\\". By 1809, it was mostly enclosed. In the 19th century, the area was developed as a wealthy suburb, and many large terraces and villas from the period remain, though a large proportion have fallen into disuse or are divided into smaller, low-rent flats. The area remains leafy and architecturally notable. Buildings have been adapted by successive communities who have settled in the area as places of worship and for a range of social uses. The Union Chapel on Chapeltown Road became a synagogue and then a Sikh temple, although it is now disused following a period of disrepair and fire damage. Chapeltown Barracks, now demolished, were completed in 1820. =Development= Potternewton Hall Estate, off Chapeltown Road home of Leeds Mayor Darnton Lupton in the 1830s Old building on Chapeltown Road being used as nurseryA map made of Leeds in 1834 shows that Chapeltown was pasture land between Chapel Allerton and Potternewton and Leeds and known as Potternewton. Through the centre of the farmland, which was earmarked as a planned \\"New Town\\" suburb, ran the Leeds-Harrogate Turnpike Road which later became Chapeltown Road. Much of the land, called \\"Squire's Pastures\\" belonged to Earl Cowper. He owned much land east of Chapeltown Road and some to the west. In the final decades of the 18th century and early decades of the 19th century legal disputes arose regarding the estates of the Barker/Ray family who had built Potternewton Hall \\"for the widow, Mrs Barker, to retire to\\" in the 1730s. They owned the estate, both the \\"upper house\\" (Potternewton Hall) and the \\"lower house\\" (Newton Hall) which was described by Ralph Thoresby, as a \\"venerable old fabric, standing low and shady\\". In 1600, Low Hall (Newton Hall) had an estate worth 300 pounds a year. In 1837, Darnton Lupton was the Mesne lord under Earl Cowper of Potternewton Hall Estate. Earl Cowper began selling land for development in 1825, but planning and building was slow, and the sale was not completed until 1873. The Earl also set out a Deed of Arrangement defining the residential character of any future building including the limitation of livestock, heavy industry and public houses. By 1866 the area east of Chapeltown Road and north of Roundhay Road had acquired streets of pleasant houses intended for the growing middle class, and known as New Leeds.Murray Freedman (2002) Chapeltown and its Jews (M. P. Freedman) Harehills Avenue next to Newton Terrace Chapeltown Leeds Further north towards Potternewton work began in 1856 on Newton Grove where the Lupton family developed their Newton Park Estate following the designs of Charles Chorley and John Connon. The development expanded, including Sholebroke Avenue by the 1880s. Chapeltown Road Leeds St Martin's Church and shops on Chapeltown Road were built on Newton Park Estate land in the late 19th century. By the 1890s, the popularity of Chapeltown waned, in favour of areas further from the city. The remaining empty plots were filled with smaller, cheaper, terraced housing. By the start of the 20th century, the area was almost completely filled with housing. Newton Hall which had been the Lupton family residence was demolished in the 1920s. Potternewton Hall demolished c. 1935. Little building work took place in Chapeltown throughout the 20th century, unlike many other areas which were subject to slum clearances. Neighbouring Harehills was much the same. One reason that could have led to Chapeltown being left was the quality of its housing stock, although they now largely achieve low rents, the houses are generally well built as they were originally built for the influx of Leeds' new middle class brought on by the industrial revolution. =Population= The Latvian Social Club on Mexborough Avenue Over time Chapeltown has been home to successive emigre communities that have each added a new dimension to the culture, religious practices and heritage of the area. Ashkenazi Jews fleeing pogroms in Eastern Europe towards the end of the 19th century moved to Leeds and settled in the inner city area of the Leylands. Other groups of Jews also settled there, and synagogues were built. In the 20th century many of the community moved north to the more desirable area of New Leeds/Chapeltown, and so did their synagogues, at one time there were 14 in Chapeltown. Along with neighbouring Harehills, where Montague Burton established his factory, Chapeltown was an important area for tailoring and allied trades, which occupied many Jews, and is remembered by the street name Button Hill. Northern School of Contemporary Dance In 1932 the Chapeltown Road New Synagogue, a large domed Byzantine-style building, was opened. The opening was in time for the High Festivals of that year, with Rabbi Hurwitz delivering that first Shabbat Shuvah sermon. The artist David Hillman was commissioned, in 1935, to design three stained-glass windows for the shul in commemoration of the Silver Jubilee of King George V. They have been moved to Shadwell Lane Synagogue. In the following decades the Jewish population in Chapeltown declined as many families moved north to the Moortown area. In 1985 the synagogue closed and the building was bought by Leeds City Council. It is now home to the Northern School of Contemporary Dance. Chapeltown road The British African-Caribbean community in Leeds mostly came to the UK between the end of the Second World War and the early 1960s. Many of the first Jamaicans to settle in Leeds were ex-servicemen. To encourage mass immigration from the countries of the British Empire and Commonwealth to fill shortages in the labour market, the 1948 British Nationality Act gave British citizenship to all people living in Commonwealth countries, and full rights of entry and settlement in Britain. Many of the first generation of Jamaicans living in Chapeltown today immigrated during this period. The Jamaica Society was formed, with headquarters at 277 Chapeltown Road to support the needs and celebrate the contributions of the African-Caribbean population in West Yorkshire and Leeds. =Recent history= In May 2003, Leeds City Council designated parts of Chapeltown/Potternewton as a conservation area in recognition of its special architectural and historic interest and to protect its character from harmful change. This enlarges the St Mary's Road (Chapeltown) conservation area on the former Newton Park Estate; this area being first designated in December 1974. Around 2009/2010 the area became less run down with Spencer Place being prostitute free, the bus lane on Chapeltown Road being extended to serve the full length of the road, the addition of a bicycle lane, the decaying buildings getting repaired and the addition of the Reginald Centre, a joint service centre which replaces the original library in the area (similar to the Compton Centre in Harehills). There are many innovative Co-op housing associations in Chapeltown such as Cornerstone, 301 Housing Co-operative and Chapeltown Cohousing. Culture and environment The area is home to a wide range of community and creative organisations including the Northern School of Contemporary Dance, the Chapletown house choir, the Host Media centre, and Leeds West Indian Centre (now famous for its club nights, particularly the monthly SubDub). Chapel Allerton Hospital is found in the area, and is one of Leeds' main hospitals, though it does not have an Accident and Emergency department. =Carnival= Carnival procession in Chapeltown, Leeds, 27 August 2007 Every August bank holiday weekend the area hosts the Leeds Carnival, second only in size to London's Notting Hill Carnival, however Leeds Carnival started in 1941 and predates that of Notting Hill. Arthur France, a Leeds University student from Saint Kitts helped to organise the first West Indian Carnival in Britain in Leeds in 1967. That year Vicki Celto was the first Carnival Queen for Leeds in a costume titled \\"Sun Goddess\\". =Northern School of Contemporary Dance= The NSCD is a modern conservatoire dance school with its origins in the Leeds dance education of the 1970s and 1980s. Two years after the founding of the school in 1985, it moved to its current home in Chapeltown in 1987. The Riley Theatre was built in the former synagogue, and over the next ten years a number of new dance studios were created on the site and the Brandsby Lodge was renovated. Today the school is a contemporary dance institution with nearly 200 students. =Crime= As a neighbourhood with a history of economic downturn, Chapeltown has a huge association with crime. The area has suffered some serious social problems, including some street drug dealing and a fear of gun crime in the last decade. However, Findaproperty.com states that Chapeltown's association with crime is \\"grossly exaggerated\\". The Leeds Index of Deprivation ranked Chapeltown 20th out of 108 areas of the city for problems with community safety, and it is ranked as safer than most other inner-city areas of Leeds. In July 1981 it was one of the areas of English cities home to the widespread race riots of that year. There have been sporadic moments of social unrest since then including a riot in 1987 . The most recent riot occurred on 29 July 1991, when around 100 youths (predominantly of West Indian origin) went on a spree of looting and vandalism throughout the area. Police believed that the main culprits of the riot were members of a local drugs gang. During the 2011 England riots there were \\"small pockets of disorder\\" in Chapeltown after a local man was shot in the face and later died in hospital. However it later was confirmed that a group of 10‚Äì15 youths caused 'some' damage to 3 cars in the area. Religion The changing population of the area is shown by the religious buildings, particularly along the Chapeltown Road. At the North end, by Chapel Allerton Hospital, is the 1976 Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Czestochowa & St. Stanislaw Kostka, serving the Polish community. (The Warsaw Stores on Chapeltown Road was a major source of Polish food in Leeds before a proliferation of Eastern European shops.) Further down is St Martin's Church, the original Anglican parish church of the village of Potternewton, now with a mainly West Indian congregation. Then comes the Church of God of Prophecy, a Pentecostal church with a mainly Afro-Caribbean congregation. Next door is the new Sikh Temple, the largest in Leeds. Opposite, now out of use, is a church which was originally a Union Chapel, then a Synagogue and then a Sikh Temple until the new one was constructed. Near the South end, the Holy Rosary Church was built in 1937 for the Irish Catholic community. Until 1985 the next building down was an impressive purpose-built synagogue, the largest in Leeds, which is now the Northern School of Contemporary Dance. The Roscoe Methodist Church on Francis Street (off Chapeltown Road) dates from 1974, but replaces a chapel founded in 1862.Yorkshire Evening Post 8 October 2011 Neil Hudson \\"The Leeds church that changed with the times\\" Elsewhere, a former United Reformed Church (1906) has become the Chapeltown Community Church by Potternewton Park. The Church of the Three Hierarchs in Harehills Avenue is a former Methodist chapel reopened as a Greek Orthodox church in 1966. As late as 1993, maps showed four synagogues in the areaAZ Leeds and Bradford Street Atlas (1993) Geographers' A-Z Map Co Ltd including the main one, but these have all closed. The first mosque in Leeds was created in a house in Leopold Street in 1961.Yorkshire Evening Post 15 March 2012 Blue plaque for historic Leeds property With the influx of Muslims from India and Pakistan in the 60s and 70s, larger buildings were acquired in 1974 and 1982 to become the main mosque in Leeds, and finally in 2001 the Central Jamia Mosque was completed on Spencer Place.Leeds Islamic Centre Brief History of Leeds Islamic Centre File:PolishChurchLeeds3.jpgRoman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Czestochowa & St. Stanislaw Kostka File:StMartinsPotter2.jpgSt Martin's Church of England parish church File:ChurchofGodofProphecyLS7.jpgChurch of God of Prophecy File:SikhTempleLS7.jpgSikh Temple File:UnionChapelSikh.jpgFormer chapel, synagogue and temple File:HolyRosaryChurchLS7.jpgHoly Rosary Roman Catholic Church File:ChapeltownChurchLeeds.jpgChapeltown Community Church File:ThreeHierarchsLeeds.jpgThree Hierarchs Greek Orthodox Church File:House of Faith Leopold Street.jpg21 Leopold Street.

It is southeast of the city centre and has an industrial past. It is situated in the Hunslet and Riverside ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds Central parliamentary constituency. The population of the previous City and Hunslet council ward at the 2011 census was 33,705. Hunslet had many engineering companies based in the district, such as John Fowler & Co. manufacturers of traction engines and steam rollers, the Hunslet Engine Company builders of locomotives (including those used during the construction of the Channel Tunnel), as well as engineering firms Kitson & Co., Manning Wardle and Hudswell Clarke. Many railway locomotives were built in the Jack Lane area of Hunslet. The area has a mixture of modern and 19th century industrial buildings, terraced housing and 20th century housing. It is an area that has grown up significantly around the River Aire in the early years of the 21st century, especially with the construction of modern riverside flats. It was at one point the main production site for Leeds Creamware, a type of pottery (still produced) so called because of its cream glazing. Hunslet is now prospering as it follows the trend of Leeds generally and the expansion of office and industrial sites south of Leeds city centre. Etymology Hunslet is first mentioned as Hunslet in the Domesday Book of 1086, though twelfth- century spellings of the name such as Hunsflete seem to be more conservative: the name appears originally to have meant 'H≈´n's creek', from an Anglo-Saxon personal name H≈´n and the Old English word flƒìot 'creek, inlet', probably referring to an inlet from the River Aire.A. H. Smith, The Place-Names of the West Riding of Yorkshire, English Place-Names Society, 30‚Äì37, 8 vols (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1961‚Äì63), III 220. The district of Hunslet Carr, whose name is first attested in the period 1175-89 as Kerra, includes the northern English dialect word carr, meaning 'bog' (borrowed into English from Old Norse kjarr, which had the same meaning). Meanwhile, Hunslet moor is first mentioned in 1588.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place- Names Society, 2017), p. 58.  History  The Hunslet Feast in 1850 The former Tetley's Brewery in the Crown Point area of Hunslet, Leeds At the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, the manor of Hunslet belonged to the Lacys, from whom it passed to various families including the Gascoignes and the Neviles. Hunslet was the birthplace of Thomas Gascoigne, born in 1404 and later chancellor of Oxford University. The brewers Joshua Tetley and Son set up business in Hunslet in 1822 producing beer and bitter today as part of Carlsberg Tetley group. However, in 2011 the brewery closed. In 1823 forty working men from Hunslet raised the sum of ¬£1.5s.1d which they sent to the radical publisher Richard Carlile who was serving a prison sentence in Dorchester jail for the publications in which he exposed the reactionary policies of the government of Lord Liverpool. The subscription was accompanied by a noble letter written by one of the contributors, William Tillotson.The Republican, volume 8, page 107 The population of Hunslet grew rapidly in the first half of the 19th century becoming an important manufacturing centre. Several large mills were built for spinning of flax including Hunslet Mill, and there were chemical works, works for the manufacture of crown and flint glass, extensive potteries for coarse earthenware and the Leeds Pottery. The gasholders at the Meadow Lane Gas Works From 1898 to 1935 it was the home of the Leeds Steel Works, with four blast furnaces, which was the site of a major industrial accident in 1913, when a boiler explosion killed nine men. Thirteen years earlier, four men had died in a very similar explosion.By 1906 Hunslet was home to Leeds‚Äô second-largest gas works, the city's main rail goods yards, known at the time as Midland Goods Station (now the site of Crown Point Retail Park), as well as a large number of factories. The area was redeveloped in the 1960s, the main feature of this being the Hunslet Grange (Leek Street flats). In the 1980s it was again redeveloped, and in the 2000s, the area around the River Aire and Clarence Dock was redeveloped. Aire Park, a new public open space and redevelopment, is now being planned for the site surrounding The Tetley art gallery as part of the regeneration of the South Bank of Leeds.  Geography  Hunslet, in the lower Aire Valley, is bounded on the east by the River Aire and covers nearly 1,200 acres of flat land. The underlying rocks were coal measures. Hunslet has different areas including Hunslet Moor, Hunslet Carr, Crown Point, Pottery Fields and Penny Hill. Crown Point once had a large railway depot which contained Leeds' main goods station. After many decades lying derelict the area was redeveloped into the Crown Point Retail Park, though the main railway cutting into the terminus station can still be seen at the southern end. The former track beds are currently let for storage and contain timber and brickwork. Tetley's Brewery was to the north of this area, as was the Yorkshire Chemical Works: both have now been demolished. Next to the river is Clarence Dock. Pottery Fields is the industrial area around Kidacre Street, Leathley Road, Ivory Street, Meadow Lane and Cross Myrtle Street where Leeds City Council's Pottery Fields Depot and the former Meadow Lane Gas Works are situated. Pottery Fields House, has the administrative and engineering functions for Northern Gas Networks. Other businesses include Merlin Gerin medium voltage electrical supplies, a scrap yard and Volkswagen auto breakers, and a motorcycle training centre. There are several disused railways crossing the roads, which brought coal from Middleton Colliery to the Meadow Lane Gas Works for the production of town gas, before conversion to North Sea natural gas. Penny Hill surrounds Church Street. This is the old centre of Hunslet referred to as Hunslet Grange when the Leek Street Flats (1968 to 1983) were built. The Leek Street Flats developed problems with crime and condensation and were demolished fifteen years after their construction. The area was again redeveloped in the 1980s with more traditional houses. The area contains the Penny Hill Shopping Centre and a Morrisons supermarket.  Economy  Hunslet today is still primarily based around manufacturing and heavy engineering. Newer industries have moved to the western fringes of the area in recent years with the building of new office complexes including the Leeds City Business Park which originally opened with offices for companies including O2 and British Gas. O2 have since moved to Morley. The Morrisons supermarket in the Penny Hill Centre as well as the Costco wholesale warehouse on Leathley Road are also large employers. In 2011, Aston Barclay, a car auction group, purchased the former Motor Auctions Leeds car centre on Hillidge Road to further add to the regeneration of the area. According to an article by the Yorkshire Evening Post, 43% of the area's population lives in poverty and it has the ninth highest child poverty rate in the country, with a reported 4,579 children having been fed by food banks between April 2019 and February 2020.  Religion  St Mary the Virgin Church A chapel dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin, was built in 1636, and enlarged in 1774. It was a brick structure with a tower. It was enlarged by subscription in 1826. The present church is the third on the site. The Victorian church, of which the spire remains, is the tallest in Leeds, was built in 1864 and the present building was built in the 1970s. Other smaller less notable churches exist in the district. The area is also home to St Joseph's Catholic Club.  Hunslet Grange (Leek Street Flats)  Hunslet Grange (Leek Street) flats in 1973 Hunslet's redevelopment in the 1960s was notable for the construction of the Hunslet Grange (usually known as 'Leek Street Flats'). Construction of the 350 flats and maisonettes started in 1968 following a widespread slum clearance project in the area. The complex was commissioned by Leeds City Council and built by Shepherd Construction, in a maisonette style with so-called 'streets in the sky' and overhead walkways connecting blocks. The exterior of the buildings were pale grey pebbledashed concrete. Each floor had a rubbish disposal chute leading to huge bins at street level. Hidden in the complex on the second floor were shops and a public house, 'The Pioneer'. Twelve of the blocks were six storeys in height and six were of seven, with the entrance on the second floor. The estate covered a large area of Hunslet and was arranged in three clusters around a small park. The individual flats had large windows and were spacious and light, and were very popular with their new tenants. But the popularity was short-lived; the heating systems were inadequate for the poorly insulated concrete prefabricated buildings, the interiors suffered from condensation and the exterior walls became streaked with black. In addition, the \\"rabbit-warren\\" layout made the estate hard to navigate and, within a few years, even harder to police. Demolition of the complex started in 1983, less than fifteen years after the first tenants moved in, to be replaced with low- rise council housing, which was largely built around the late 1980s. Low Rise private housing was added in the 1990s and 2000s and a public space known as Hunslet Green occupies much of this space.  Charities and voluntary organisations  Stringer House, 34 Lupton Street, offices of Voluntary Action Leeds The area is home to a number of voluntary organisations servicing the community, this includes the Hunslet Club, a youth organisation established in 1940 which provides sport, dance and drama activities for hundreds of young people in the area as well as offering vocational education courses for 14- to 16-year-olds. Hunslet is also the home of Voluntary Action Leeds, the Council for Voluntary Service in Leeds, which provides direct support services and specialist advice to Voluntary Sector organisations across the city.  Transport  M621 junction 3, with entrance to junction 4 for Hunslet visible The M621 and A61, two major roads, pass through the area, providing convenient access to the whole of Yorkshire and access the M62 to Manchester and Hull. The motorway was completed in 1971, and isolated a large part of Hunslet Moor. Leeds Hunslet Lane railway station was located on the Hallam Line. It opened in 1840, but in 1846 the Midland Railway replaced it with Leeds Wellington station, and Hunslet Lane became a goods depot, which closed in 1972: the area is now occupied by the Crown Point Retail Park. There was also a passenger station on Hillidge Road: this is gone, but the Station Hotel remains.Leodis Hillidge Road, Station Hotel The railway yard is now used as the Leeds Vehicle Maintenance Facility for Freightliner.www.freightliner.co.uk Leeds Vehicle Maintenance Facility Education An educational hub has been formed in the north of Hunslet, with Leeds City College's Printworks Campus using the former Alf Cooke printworks building, Leeds College of Building's Cudbear Street site,Leeds College of Building: Facts and Figures, accessed 13 June 2017 the Ruth Gorse Academy and University Technical College Leeds (UTC) using the former Braine's engineering works, all in close proximity to each other.South Bank Education, accessed 13 June 2017 Bewerley Street Infant School, designed by famous Leeds architect, George Corson, opened on 8 August 1873. By the 1950s, the school was for Juniors (7 ‚Äì 11 Years) and the Infants had moved to a school on Hunslet Hall Road.Leodis, Bewerley Street Infant School, from Bewerley Street, accessed 23 June 2017  Sport  The area also possesses a rugby league club with historic roots in the form of Hunslet who play at the John Charles Centre for Sport formerly known as the South Leeds Stadium. The original Hunslet, who played at Parkside, Hunslet, club were the first club in Rugby League to win \\"All Four Cups\\" in season 1907‚Äì08, the Challenge Cup, the RFL Championship, the Yorkshire County League Cup and the Yorkshire County Cup. Only two other clubs have achieved this feat, Huddersfield (1914‚Äì15) and Swinton (1927‚Äì28). Other local rugby league clubs include Hunslet Warriors, and Hunslet Parkside.

Sender ID is defined primarily in Experimental RFC 4406, but there are additional parts in RFC 4405, RFC 4407 and RFC 4408.  Principles of operation  Sender ID is heavily based on SPF, with only a few additions. These differences are discussed here. Sender ID tries to improve on SPF: SPF does not verify the header addresses (of which there can be more than one) that indicate the claimed sending party. One of these header addresses is typically displayed to the user and may be used to reply to emails. These header addresses can be different from the address that SPF tries to verify; that is, SPF verifies only the \\"MAIL FROM\\" address, also called the envelope sender. However, there are many similar email header fields that all contain sending party information; therefore Sender ID defines in RFC 4407 a Purported Responsible Address (PRA) as well as a set of heuristic rules to establish this address from the many typical headers in an email. Syntactically, Sender ID is almost identical to SPF except that \`v=spf1\` is replaced with one of: * \`spf2.0/mfrom\` \\\\- meaning to verify the envelope sender address just like SPF. * \`spf2.0/mfrom,pra\` or \`spf2.0/pra,mfrom\` \\\\- meaning to verify both the envelope sender and the PRA. * \`spf2.0/pra\` \\\\- meaning to verify only the PRA. The only other syntactical difference is that Sender ID offers the feature of positional modifiers not supported in SPF. In practice, so far no positional modifier has been specified in any Sender ID implementation. In practice, the pra scheme usually only offers protection when the email is legitimate, while offering no real protection in the case of spam or phishing. The pra for most legitimate email will be either the familiar From: header field, or, in the case of mailing lists, the Sender: header field. In the case of phishing or spam, however, the pra may be based on Resent-* header fields that are often not displayed to the user. To be an effective anti-phishing tool, the MUA (Mail User Agent or Mail Client) will need to be modified to display either the pra for Sender ID, or the Return-Path: header field for SPF. The pra tries to counter the problem of phishing, while SPF or mfrom tries to counter the problem of spam bounces and other auto-replies to forged Return-Paths. Two different problems with two different proposed solutions. However, Sender-ID and SPF yield the same result in approximately 80% of the cases, according to a billion message analysis. Standardization issues The pra has the disadvantage that forwarders and mailing lists can only support it by modifying the mail header, e.g. insert a \`Sender\` or \`Resent-Sender\`. The latter violates RFC 2822 and can be incompatible with RFC 822. With SPF, mailing lists continue to work as is. Forwarders wishing to support SPF only need to modify SMTP MAIL FROM and RCPT TO, not the mail. That's no new concept; with the original RFC 821 SMTP forwarders always added their host name to the reverse path in the MAIL FROM. The most problematic point in the core Sender ID specification is its recommendation to interpret \`v=spf1\` policies like \`spf2.0/mfrom,pra\` instead of \`spf2.0/mfrom\`. This was never intended by all published SPF drafts since 2003, and for an unknown large number of \`v=spf1\` policies an evaluation for pra could cause bogus results for many cases where pra and mfrom are different. This problem was the basis of an appeal to the Internet Architecture Board (IAB). In response to another prior appeal the IESG already noted that Sender ID cannot advance on the IETF standards track without addressing the incompatibility with a MUST in RFC 2822. Various surveys performed in 2012, when SPF turned from experimental to proposed standard, showed that fewer than 3% of mail domains published specific requests for using the pra, compared to some 40~50% of mail domains using SPF.  Intellectual property  The Sender ID proposal was the subject of controversy regarding intellectual property licensing issues: Microsoft holds patentshttp://www.internetnews.com/dev- news/article.php/3409971/Exposed+Sender+ID+Patents+Up+Debate.htm on key parts of Sender ID and used to license those patents under terms that were not compatible with the GNU General Public License and which were considered problematic for free software implementations in general. On October 23, 2006, Microsoft placed those patents under the Open Specification Promise, which is compatible with some free and open source licenses, but not with the most recent version of the GPL license, version 3.x.

Paul Chabas's September Morn, 1912, oil on canvas, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Biography He was born in Nantes, and had his artistic training under William-Adolphe Bouguereau and Tony Robert-Fleury. He first exhibited at the Salon in 1890. Chabas won the Prix National at the 1899 Paris Salon with his Joyeux √âbats. He was awarded a gold medal at the Exposition Universelle of 1900 and in 1912 received the M√©daille d‚Äôhonneur. His preferred subject was a nude young woman in a natural setting. He was considered to be one of Europe's greatest painters of nudes. His most famous painting, Matin√©e de Septembre (September Morn) (1912), became a \\"succ√®s de scandale\\" in the United States in May, 1913, when Anthony Comstock, secretary of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, protested against the painting as supposedly immoral. Chabas was offended by the controversy over the painting. For a time he sought anonymity in the South of France. There was much publicity, and reproductions of the painting sold well for years afterwards. September Morn has often been cited as an example of kitsch. Chabas refused to identify the model who was the subject of the painting, referring to her only as \\"Marthe\\". However, the controversy regarding the painting's model refused to disappear. As late as 1935, a rumor circulated that the young woman was living in poverty and Chabas was receiving letters from people in the US who wanted to come to her aid. He also recalled how offended he was when the painting was considered indecent by some in the US more than twenty years before. Chabas first visited the United States in 1914 for a season of painting there. Before the journey he commented on rumors that he disliked the US, as he refused to sell September Morn to a US newspaper publisher after the controversy about the painting began. Chabas said he did not originally intend to sell the painting, because it was his wife's favorite. When he entered the painting in the Paris Salon of 1912, he set a price of $10,000, which he believed no one would pay. Leon Mantashev, son of oil magnate Alexander Mantashev, was willing to meet this price, and the painting was sold to him. Later in his life, Chabas said that he loved the painting, which some called his masterpiece. While Chabas said he supposed it was, he was certain that \\"in it is all that I know of painting\\". He stated that he had made no money from the many reproductions of the painting, although many others did. Chabas remarked that those who had profited from his work were not \\"thoughtful enough to send me even a box of cigars.\\" In the 1890s, Chabas illustrated books by such authors as Paul Bourget and Alfred de Musset. English translation of \\"Un Saint\\" with illustrations by Chabas He also did some illustrating work for the French publisher Alphonse Lemerre. (in French) He became a member of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts in 1921 and received the L√©gion d‚Äôhonneur in 1928. From 1925 to 1935 he was president of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais. He died in Paris on May 10, 1937 after a long illness. Chabas, now a widower, died in a room where there was only one painting‚Äîa copy of September Morn which he had painted from memory. During his lifetime, Paul Chabas was also a celebrated portrait painter.

Record changers first appeared in the late 1920s, and were common until the 1980s. History The record changer with a stepped center spindle design was invented by Eric Waterworth of Hobart, Australia, in 1925. He and his father took it to Sydney, and arranged with a company called Home Recreations to fit it into its forthcoming phonograph, the Salonola. Although this novelty was demonstrated at the 1927 Sydney Royal Easter Show, Home Recreations went into liquidation and the Salonola was never marketed. In 1928, the Waterworths traveled to London, where they sold their patent to the new Symphony Gramophone and Radio Co. Ltd.How to Use a Record Player Eric Waterworth built three prototypes of his invention, one of which was sold to Home Recreations as a model for its proposed Salonola record player as cited above, which is now reportedly in the collection of the Museum of Applied Arts & Sciences in Sydney. The second prototype went to England with Eric and his father, and was sold as part of the above-cited deal with the Symphony Gramophone and Radio Company. The fate of this machine is unknown. The third prototype was never fully assembled, and lay in pieces under the Waterworths' house for something like sixty years. After Eric's death, the family found the disassembled parts of the machine and offered them to the Sound Preservation Association of Tasmania. The offer was accepted, and an enthusiastic member began the task of reassembling the prototype. Only a few small parts were found to be missing, and enough remained to finish assembling it and restoring it to a crude working condition. This prototype record changer is now on display at the Sound Preservation Association of Tasmania resource centre in the Hobart suburb of Bellerive. The first commercially successful record changer was the \\"Automatic Orthophonic\\" model by the Victor Talking Machine Company, which was launched in the United States in 1927. On a conventional gramophone or phonograph, the limited playing time of 78 rpm gramophone records (averaging a little over four minutes per 12-inch side, and a little over three per 10-inch side) meant that listeners had to get up to change records at regular intervals. The Automatic Orthophonic allowed the listener to load a stack of several records into the machine, which would then be automatically played in sequence for a much longer uninterrupted listening time. By the late 1950s, Garrard and Dual dominated the high-end record changer market in the US. From the late 1950s through the late 1960s, VM Corporation (Voice of Music) of Benton Harbor, Michigan, US, dominated the lower-priced original equipment manufacturer (OEM) American record changer market. Most VM (Voice of Music) record changers were sold to OEM audio manufacturers such as Zenith and installed in console-sized, portable or compact low- to mid-priced stereo or mono systems. VM record changers sold to OEMs were not labeled with the Voice of Music trademark on the unit itself, but only those retailed by VM Corporation, either as separate components or integral parts of VM phonographs, were labeled with the VM (Voice of Music) trademark on the changer. Outside the US, VM record-changer technology was licensed to several manufacturers. Telefunken, of then West Germany, was one such company to sign a licensing agreement with VM Corporation. By the late 1960s (1969), BSR MacDonald displaced VM as the world largest record-changer manufacturer and dominated the OEM changer market in the US as well. Garrard, in 1960, introduced a high fidelity record changer with a professional grade balanced tonearm and heavy cast nonmagnetic platter, both features previously found only on manual turntables. To identify it by its superior performance, it was called an \\"Automatic Turntable.\\" The name, and the improved performance, caught on and other manufacturers began producing automatic turntables with professional-grade features and performance. Most mid-priced consumer record players of the 1950s through 1970s were equipped with changers. But record-stacking changers eventually became rarer due to the gradually growing belief that they contributed greatly to record wear and \\"warping,\\" and were eventually superseded by manual turntables which served as separate parts of component systems, which played only one record at a time and were felt by some to save record wear by gentler treatment during play. Operation Record-changer mechanisms were often very complicated. Changers typically held a stack of records on an extended central spindle supported by a special arm (as opposed to the tonearm housing the cartridge and stylus which actually played the records) designed to hold the stack steady. Some units had feelers that could detect the size of each record (the three standard sizes being 7-, 10- or 12-inch) and position the tone arm accordingly. Some, including the changer pictured, used a variable-sized sensor which allowed sizes other than the three standard sizes to be played. (Note that the pictured Dual 1003 is stacked with a load of records of four different sizes, which could be mixed in any order.) The more basic models required the record diameter to be set manually, and hence did not allow records of different sizes to be stacked together. The following devices were the most popular (with examples): Three-size sensors: * Size-selector knob no size intermix (BSR 1968 to 1973) * Size- and speed-selector knob no size intermix, so that some types couldn't be played automatically (Garrard after 1969) * Rising feelers in or alongside turntable no size intermix, but automatic sensing of size (PE after 1970) * Falling record sensor random intermix sizes mixed in any order (BSR before 1968) * Rising and falling record sensors intermix 10- and 12-inch records vs. separate playing of 7-inch (VM 1950 to 1970) * Unplayed stack sensor arranged intermix, large records before small (Webster Chicago 1950 to 1953) * Unplayed stack arm tip sensor arranged intermix (Collaro/Magnavox after 1967) Variable-size sensors: * Pickup arm scan of unplayed stack arranged intermix, odd sizes (Collaro/Magnavox 1954 to 1967) * Pickup arm scan of lowered record random intermix, odd sizes (PE 1957 to 1969) * Arm tip feeler wheels (feel only top record on turntable) random intermix, odd sizes (Dual 1003, 1004, 1005, 1006) * Arm top feeler Wheels (feel only bottom record on stack) random intermix, odd sizes (Miracord 9 and 90) * Pickup arm scan of separated record random intermix, odd sizes (Thorens TD-224) Audiophiles eventually disdained record changers because of the perceived compromise in fidelity resulting from changes in tone arm angle with the height of the stack, and concerns about changers' seemingly rough treatment of discs, particularly due to slight but cumulative damage to the spindle holes as the records were dropped from a height of a few inches onto the record or stack below or the turntable platter, as well as some sliding and rubbing of the discs together, scratching the record labels in the process, because the dropped disc didn't immediately accelerate to the rotational speed of the spindle or discs below it. Most of these fears were unfounded in changers made after 1953. More advanced changers, such as the TD-224 model from Thorens and the ADC Accutrac+6, partially addressed these problems. Automatic sequencing Numbering of the sides of the discs in many double and triple albums (and boxed sets of records (both 78s and LPs) in a certain sequence enabled them to be stacked and played on record changers. After the discs were stacked and one side of each disc had played, the entire stack would be turned over and replaced on the changer shelf. Thus, to be heard in the proper sequence, each disc of a four-disc set would contain, respectively, \\"sides\\" 1&8, 2&7, 3&6 and 4&5 a practice known as \\"automatic sequencing\\", \\"changer sequencing\\" or \\"auto-coupling\\". In pre-LP days, classical symphonies and concertos, and later, original cast albums, would be recorded using this format. This \\"drop-automatic sequence\\" was designed for record changers which simply dropped records rather than reversing the stack as it was played in sequence. Other record changers, including some made as far back as the 1930s by RCA and GE in addition to the much later Thorens TD-224, were capable of reversing the stack automatically. The RCA and GE units kept the records stacked on the turntable and slid the top record to the side after playing it. A separate sequence, the \\"slide- automatic sequence,\\" was made for these changers, with sides coupled 1&5, 2&6, 3&7 and 4&8\\\\. Some record changers could play both sides of each record. Manual sequence (sides coupled 1&2, 3&4, 5&6 and 7&8) worked with these. Examples were the Markel 75, Capehart turnover, Fisher/Lincoln, Garrard RC-100, and Thorens Symphony CD50/CD53 changers. During the late 1930s and early 1940s, Victor released 78 rpm record sets in all three sequences (with set numbers preceded by M for manual, DM for drop-automatic or AM for slide- automatic sequencing), for players of each of the three kinds it manufactured. Columbia used MM for drop-automatic sets of three or more records, X for manual and MX for two-record drop-automatic sets. Some radio station copies were produced in \\"relay sequence\\" to be played by a DJ on two turntables with no break between sides, which were coupled as 1&3, 2&4, 5&7 and 6&8\\\\. The slide-automatic sequence also allowed uninterrupted play with two turntables.

The population at the 2011 Census was 1,126. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, the town is situated in Wharfedale, about north-west from Bolton Abbey, and is surrounded by limestone scenery. Nearby villages include Linton, Threshfield, Hebden, Conistone and Kilnsey. The entrance to an inclined shaft at Yarnbury Lead Mine to the north of Grassington. History The Domesday Book lists Grassington as part of the estate of Gamal Barn including 7 carucates of ploughland (840 acres/350ha) including Grassington, Linton and Threshfield. The Norman conquest of England made it part of the lands of Gilbert Tison. But by 1118 Tison had suffered a demotion and his lands returned to the king before being given to Lord Percy. Originally the settlement was spelt as Gherinstone and also was documented as Garsington or Gersington. The name Grassington derives variously from the Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon and Gothic languages, and means either the town of the grassy ings or a farmstead surrounded by grass. Grassington was historically a township in the parish of Linton in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It became a separate civil parish in 1866, and was transferred to North Yorkshire in 1974. Although often described by local people as a village, Grassington was granted a Royal Charter for a market and fair in 1282 giving it market town status. The market was held regularly until about 1860. A change in land use from the early 17th century, when lead mining began to assume more importance, brought some prosperity, but Grassington's heyday arrived during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The opening of the Yorkshire Dales Railway to Threshfield in 1902 brought new visitors, many of whom settled, some finding work in Skipton or in the developing limestone quarries. The Old Hall at Grassington is reputedly the oldest house in Yorkshire, dating from the late 13th or early 14th century. Grassington & Threshfield Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1908. The club continued until the Second World War. Culture and community Grassington is the main residential and tourist centre in Upper Wharfedale. Centred on its small cobbled square are shops, public houses, the village museum, small cafes, restaurants and hotels. Grassington Folk Museum houses a collection which tells the story of Wharfedale. It is an independent museum run and managed by volunteers. The area is popular with walkers, one of the most popular routes is a circular walk that includes Burnsall. Upper Wharfedale Fell Rescue Association, based in Grassington, is a voluntary mountain rescue organisation which rescues people in trouble on the surrounding fells and in caves. Grassington Festival is a two-week-long annual event started in 1980, with music, performance and visual arts, held in a number of venues around the village. Every September since 2011, Grassington has held a 1940s themed weekend. Events include war re-enactments, dances and a variety of military and civilian vehicles on display from the period. In the winter Grassington holds the Dickensian Festival, with period costumes, Christmas activities and commercial selling. A Yorkshire Dales National Park information centre is on Hebden Road. Three miles north of Grassington, at Kilnsey, is the glacially carved overhang of Kilnsey Crag. Grass Wood, an area of ancient woodland including the Iron-Age fort, Fort Gregory (also known as Gregory's Fort), is situated just over north-west of Grassington. Transport Grassington is served by the B6265, which runs between Skipton and Green Hammerton via Pateley Bridge and Boroughbridge (being a more circuitous route that the A59 road which connects Skipton and Green Hammerton). Buses connect Grassington with Ilkley and Skipton operating a moderate service to Skipton, but only a three-day a week service to Ilkley. The town used to have a joint railway station terminus with Threshfield on the Yorkshire Dales Railway. The station was located on the west side of the River Wharfe, so it was not actually in Grassington. The line opened in July 1902 but closed down in September 1930 after only 28 years of service. The station remained open to freight and railtour traffic until 1969 when the tracks were removed south as far as the limestone quarry at Swinden. The site of the railway station is now a housing estate, but the Campaign for Better Transport have listed the Skipton to Grassington line as one which they wish to see re-opened to passenger traffic. Education Grassington has a Church of England primary school located in the town and there is another primary school in nearby Threshfield. Secondary education is either at the Upper Wharfedale School, which is a non-selective specialist sports college, or in Skipton at Ermysted's Grammar School (boys only) and Skipton Girls High School, both of which are selective. Electricity generation In 1909 Grassington received its first electricity from a hydroelectric plant at Linton Falls, which continued to operate until 1948 when the National Grid arrived in the area. In March 2012 a new hydroelectric power plant was opened using the same but restored turbine house, which provides 500,000 kWh of electricity a year, using two Archimedean screws.

It is part of the City of Leeds Ward of Bramley and Stanningley with a population of 21,334 at the 2011 Census. The area is an old industrial area with much 19th century architecture and 20th century council housing in the east and private suburban housing in the west. Etymology The name of Bramley is first attested in the 1086 Domesday Book as Brameleia and Bramelei. The name derives from the Old English words br≈çm ('broom') and lƒìah ('open land in a wood'). Thus the name once meant 'open land characterised by broom'.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Names Society, 2017), p. 27. History Blue plaque on Stocks Hill At the time of the Domesday survey, the nucleus of the settlement was probably located at Stocks Hill, and it developed in a linear fashion along today's Town Street. The surviving water pump and stone water trough on Stocks Hill remain from Bramley's medieval past. The accompanying blue plaque states \\"Stocks Hill, Bramley. This historic pump and trough are the last reminders of Bramley Village Green which was surrounded by medieval cottages and yards. The Green featured the stocks, pillory and an 8ft pillar which commemorated the holding of Leeds Market here during the plague of 1644-45\\". The area experienced an industrial boom and an associated population increase in the 19th century, mostly because of the development of the woollen textile industry in the early part of the century and due to the boot making and engineering industries in its later part. Much of Bramley was redeveloped in the 1960s and 1970s, albeit in an unsympathetic manner that damaged the historic integrity of the area and altered the appearance and the character of the town significantly. The Bramley Shopping Centre replaced the former town centre, and was Leeds' second purpose-built town centre after Seacroft town centre. Unlike Seacroft, the Bramley Shopping Centre replaced an existing town centre. The redevelopment replaced substandard shops and houses; many of the shops and cottages were dilapidated and in need of repair. From 2008, following a time of deterioration of the shopping centre, new anchor stores such as Farmfoods and Tesco took over existing premises or occupied new ones in the course of a general refit. The redevelopment of Bramley was condemned by English Heritage as one of the least sensitive redevelopment programmes in Yorkshire. In 2008 the Yorkshire Evening Post ran an article describing the redevelopment of a \\"once-picturesque area\\", and questioning the replacement of an historic Yorkshire town centre. Much of historical Bramley is now protected by the Bramley Town Conservation Area, which focuses on the area around Bramley Park across to Hough Lane. Community Bramley lies within the Parliamentary constituency of Leeds West. The Member of Parliament is Labour MP Rachel Reeves. Bramley Park Parks and open areas for outdoor recreation include Bramley Falls Wood, which runs beside the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, and Bramley Park, which contains an underground reservoir at its highest point. At Bramley Park a fireworks display and the Bramley Carnival is held most years. Bramley Baths Bramley Baths are an example of Edwardian swimming baths. Built in 1904, and restored, it has a 25-yard pool, a gymnasium and a Russian steam room. The baths were used for dances during its early years, when the pool was covered with a large dance floor. The baths are the only remaining example of an Edwardian era bath-house in Leeds today and are a Grade II listed structure. Bramley Shopping Centre is a 1960s-style concrete shopping plaza which was erected to replace the traditional stone-built village centre.

Roundhay had a population of 22,546 in 2011. It sits in the Roundhay ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds North East parliamentary constituency. History Roundhay's name derives from Old French rond 'round' and the Old English word (ge)h√¶g 'enclosure', denoting a round hunting enclosure or deer park.West Yorkshire Archaeology Advisory Service Roundhay Park Conservation Area; Victor Watts (ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names Based on the Collections of the English Place-Name Society (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), s.v. ROUNDHAY.A circular fence requires the minimum length to enclose any given area, reducing the materials and work required The Roundhay estate map of 1803 showed its circular shape.Steven Burt (2000) Roundhay Park - an illustrated history It does not appear in the Domesday Book of 1086, but seems to have been formed soon afterwards, the first mention being in about 1153. It was formerly a hunting park for the De Lacy family of Pontefract Castle. Coal and iron ore were mined and a smelting furnace was recorded in 1295. Once these were exhausted (and woodland had been cleared for fuel) the area turned to farming. Roundhay was historically a township in the ancient parish of Barwick in Elmet, except for a small area in the east around Roundhay Grange (originally a grange of Kirkstall Abbey), which was a detached part of the township of Shadwell in the parish of Thorner. Roundhay was a hamlet until 1803 when the park estate was bought by Thomas Nicholson who started a programme of landscaping and built the Mansion House. Housing was built for workers and more land sold on which other gentry built houses. Until 1810 Gipton Wood was Gibton Forest separating Leeds from Roundhay Park and a turnpike road was constructed \\"from Sheepscar to Roundhay Bridge\\". J. Dickinson & G.D. Webster (1967) A History of St John's Church RoundhayRoundhay Bridge was near the Lido Car Park on Wetherby Road After the road was built the population increased from 84 in 1801 to 186 in 1822, mainly in grand houses for wealthier citizens of Leeds. St John's Church (Anglican) 1826 In 1826 St John's Church was established to serve the population of Roundhay, Shadwell and Seacroft, a combined population of about 1100, who would otherwise have had to travel up to three miles to worship. This made the area more attractive, the population rose to 300 in the 1830s in the form of a \\"township and genteel village\\" with \\"elegant villas, walks and plantations\\". In 1866 Roundhay and Shadwell both became separate civil parishes. In 1872 Roundhay Park estate was purchased by the City of Leeds and opened as a public park by His Royal Highness Prince Arthur on 19 September 1872.Daily News 20 September 1872 Prince Arthur at Leeds At the time, there was much opposition as many considered the park was too far out of Leeds for the majority of the population to enjoy, and the park had just one access road and led to the park being dubbed a 'white elephant' in its early years.See various issues of the Leeds Mercury in 1871 and 1872 Redundant tram pylons in Roundhay However, there was interest in developing housing, and a suburb began to develop around Lidgett Park. Development was accelerated in 1848 by the provision of a horse- drawn public omnibus service between Leeds and Roundhay Park, then a horse- drawn tram, and on 11 November 1891 the first public electric tram service, which by 1894 provided a quarter-hourly service from 6 a.m. The city sold surplus land, but placed restrictions in its use, stipulating stone for building and the prohibition of offensive trades. The area acquired a Post Office in 1868 and by the start of the 20th century some parts were lit by electricity. Brick-built detached and semi-detached housing was created along new roads such as The Avenue. On 14 October 1888, Louis le Prince recorded his short film Roundhay Garden Scene, in the garden of Oakwood Grange, the home of his parents-in-law, Joseph and Sarah Whitley, (the parents of John Robinson Whitley). This is believed to be the oldest surviving film in existence. In 1901 a second Anglican Church and in 1902 a Congregational Church were established to provide worship within walking distance for the new working class population. Lidgett Park Wesleyan Church followed in 1906. Roundhay, looking towards the park in 1963. In June 1907 an open-air swimming pool or 'lido' opened, at a cost of just over ¬£1,600, built mainly by unemployed citizens. During the 1950s and 1960s about 100,000 people a year visited the Roundhay 'swimming baths'. In 1912, the civil parishes of Roundhay and Shadwell were abolished, and Roundhay became part of Leeds. During the First World War Roundhay was used as a gathering place for soldiers, hence land by Prince's Avenue is known as Soldiers Field. After the war, new estates were built to the south and west of the park. Roundhay School for Boys was opened in 1926, and the School for Girls in 1932. After the Second World War housing filled available spaces, with smaller residences built in the grounds of larger ones, and large converted to flats. Mansion House and large houses The Mansion House viewed from the park; in 1842, the estate's landholdings were well over 1000 acresIn 1811, John Clarke (died 1857) of York, architect of the Commercial Buildings in Leeds city centre, was commissioned by Thomas Nicholson to design the Mansion House. It was built in ashlar stone in classical Georgian style; of two storeys with seven bays, the centre three set behind an iron portico. It was one of Clarke's early works. For a country house, it is of modest size, but elevated to command views southwards over the park, and provides a focal point to Thomas Nicholson's designed park landscape. Thomas's son, Stephen Nicholson Esq., inherited the house and became the Lord of the Manor of Roundhay. Roundhay township's 1467 acres were recorded in 1842 as being \\"mostly [Stephen's] property\\". The Mansion House stood empty for many years after the departure of catering firm, Gilpin's. Events and catering company 'Dine' was appointed by Leeds City Council to run the Mansion, and in 2009, after refurbishment and gaining a civil ceremony licence, the Mansion re-opened to the public. The venue contains a restaurant and cafe, and hosts private functions.http://www.roundhaytoday.co.uk/sectionhome.aspx?sectionID=10615 By 1936, the Georgian Roundhay estate, Beechwood, was reduced to 171 acresFrom the early 1800s, a number of farming estates with large houses were built in Roundhay and some houses are now grade II listed; The Mansion at Roundhay Park (c. 1811), Elmete Hall (1865) and Beechwood (c. 1820). In 1873, architect George Corson won a competition to design a number of substantial villas along Park Avenue, \\"the jewel in Leed's crown\\", and West Avenue on the fringe of Roundhay Park. The villas were built on plots of an acre or more with separate coach houses, stables and servants' quarters at the back so as not to be seen from the park. Woodlands Hall (known originally as Roundhay Mount and later as Carr Head), Parc Mont and several other mansions along Park Avenue are architecturally significant. Roundhay Park Waterloo Lake, Roundhay Park Roundhay Park (2.8 km2), is a Victorian park, the second largest city park in Europe after the 'Englischer Garten' (3.7 km2), in Munich, Germany. Roundhay Park comprises more than of parkland, lakes and woodland. The park has scented gardens for the blind, National Plant Collections, Canal Gardens, the Monet and Alhambra Gardens and Tropical World which attracts visitors all year round. In 2005 the Friends' Garden was opened, alongside Canal Gardens and the Rainbow Garden. Woodpeckers, common warblers in spring and summer, mute swans, visiting whooper swans, great-crested grebes and herons can be found at the park. The Upper Lake is maintained as a wildlife area, and the larger Waterloo Lake is used for fishing. Roundhay Park provides the venue for special events including sporting events, flower and animal shows, music festivals and a bonfire and firework display on 5 November, (Guy Fawkes Night). Facilities include tennis courts, skateboard ramps, sports pitches, bowling greens, a sports arena, a golf course and fishing. A cafe overlooking Waterloo Lake was damaged by fire in 2007 but restored and re-opened in 2008.Yorkshire Evening Post 17 June 2008 \\"Cheers all round as lake cafe re-opens\\" Roundhay Park was the first place an aircraft landed in Leeds, after a flight from Amsterdam in the Netherlands. The Park went on to have its own aerodrome with one of the earliest air passenger services comprising regular flights every half hour to Bradford. Aircraft were manufactured at the nearby Olympia aircraft works opened by Thomas Blackburn in 1914. The aerodrome operated until 1920. The factory continued until the 1960s, the previous factory site now being occupied by a large Tesco supermarket. Tropical World is located to the west of the park and contains many rare birds and butterflies. The park has hosted numerous outdoor concerts including Michael Jackson, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Robbie Williams and Ed Sheeran. Sport and culture The Leeds Tykes rugby union club was founded after the merger of the Headingley and Roundhay clubs. Roundhegians RFC was the old boys' association of Roundhay School but now operates as a rugby club for the whole of Roundhay. The club plays at Chelwood Drive at the west end of Roundhay, near Moortown.

The closest main line rail station is Leeds (approx 4.5 miles).  Housing  Victorian terrace housing in Roundhay. Roundhay has a wide variety of housing. There is a mixture of Victorian through terraces, villas and 20th-century detached and semi detached housing. Because there has never been any mass house building in Roundhay at any one time, there is no consistent style throughout the area. There are many Victorian villas and flats adjacent to the park and along the northern edge of Roundhay.

It is effective against acne conditions where comedones are predominant. Medical uses Per the recommendations of the Global Alliance on Improving Outcomes of Acne, retinoids such as adapalene are considered first-line therapy in acne treatment and are to be used either independently or in conjunction with benzoyl peroxide and/or an antimicrobial agent, like clindamycin, for maximum efficacy. Furthermore, adapalene, like other retinoids, increases the efficacy and penetration of other topical acne medications that are used in conjunction with topical retinoids as well as hastens the improvement of the post- inflammatory hyperpigmentation caused by acne. In the long term, it can be used as maintenance therapy. Off-label uses Adapalene has the unique ability to inhibit keratinocyte differentiation and decrease keratin deposition. This property makes adapalene an effective treatment for keratosis pilaris and callus. It may be used by men undergoing foreskin restoration to reduce excess keratin that forms a layer on the exterior of the human penis after circumcision. Other non-FDA approved indications that have been reported in the literature include treatment of verruca vulgaris, molluscum contagiosum, Darier disease, photoaging, pigmentary disorders, actinic keratoses and alopecia areata. A study has concluded that adapalene 0.1% gel under occlusion is an effective, safe and easy to use treatment for plantar warts and may help clear lesions faster than cryotherapy. Side effects It is common (between 1% and 10% of users) to experience a brief sensation of warmth or stinging, as well as dry skin, peeling and redness during the first 2‚Äì4 weeks of using the medication. These effects are considered mild and generally decrease over time. Any serious allergic reaction is rare. Furthermore, of the three topical retinoids, adapalene is often regarded as the most tolerable. In pregnancy Use of topical adapalene in pregnancy has not been well studied, but has a theoretical risk of retinoid embryopathy. Thus far, there is no evidence that the cream causes problems in the baby if used during pregnancy. Use is at the consumer's own risk. According to the Drugs and Lactation Database, topical adapalene has poor systemic absorption and results in low blood levels (less than 0.025 mcg/L) despite long term use, suggesting that there is low risk of harm for a nursing infant. However, it is recommended that the topical medication should not be applied to the nipple or any other area that may come into direct contact with the infant's skin.  Interactions  Adapalene has been shown to enhance the efficacy of topical clindamycin, although adverse effects are also increased. Application of adapalene gel to the skin 3‚Äì5 minutes before application of clindamycin enhances penetration of clindamycin into the skin, which may enhance the overall efficacy of the treatment as compared to clindamycin alone.  Pharmacology  Unlike the retinoid tretinoin (Retin-A), adapalene has also been shown to retain its efficacy when applied at the same time as benzoyl peroxide due to its more stable chemical structure. Furthermore, photodegradation of the molecule is less of a concern in comparison to tretinoin and tazarotene. = Pharmacokinetics = Absorption of adapalene through the skin is low. A study with six acne patients treated once daily for five days with two grams of adapalene cream applied to of skin found no quantifiable amounts, or less than 0.35 ng/mL of the drug, in the patients' blood plasma. Controlled trials of chronic users of adapalene have found drug levels in the patients' plasma to be 0.25 ng/mL. = Pharmacodynamics = Topical adapalene first penetrates the hair follicle and binds to nuclear retinoic acid receptors (namely retinoic acid receptor beta and gamma). These complexes then bind retinoid X receptor which then regulates gene transcription by binding to specific DNA sites which leads to normalization of keratinocyte differentiation allowing for decreased microcomedone formation, decreased clogging in pores, and gives adapalene its exfoliative properties by increasing cell turnover. Adapalene is also regarded as an anti-inflammatory agent, as it suppresses the inflammatory response stimulated by the presence of Cutibacterium acnes, and inhibits both lipoxygenase activity and the oxidative metabolism of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. Adapalene selectively targets retinoic acid receptor beta and retinoic acid receptor gamma when applied to epithelial cells such as those found in the skin. Its agonism of the gamma subtype is largely responsible for adapalene's observed effects. In fact, when adapalene is applied in conjunction with a retinoic acid receptor gamma antagonist, adapalene loses clinical efficacy. Retinization is a common temporary phenomenon reported by patients when the initiate treatment of retinols. Within the initial period of treatment, skin can become red, irritated, dry and may burn or itch from retinol application; however, this tends to resolve within four weeks with once a day use.  History  Adapalene is a research product of Galderma Laboratories, France. Adapalene was approved in 1996 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of acne. Available forms Tube of generic adapalene In the United States, adapalene is available under the brand name Differin in three preparations: 0.1% cream, 0.1% gel, and 0.3% gel.About Differin The 0.1% gel is available as a generic made by Teva. It is also available combined with benzoyl peroxide under the brand names Epiduo and Tactupump. In Europe, only the 0.1% cream and 0.1% gel are available. Adapalene is currently marketed by Galderma under the trade names Differin in some countries, and Adaferin in India. It is mostly available in 0.1% w/w gel form. As of July 8, 2016, Galderma received approval from the FDA for Differin Gel (adapalene gel 0.1%) as an over-the-counter (OTC) treatment for acne. The Proactiv Company also sells the adapalene gel 0.1% under its brand name Proactiv MD Adapalene 0.1%.

He won silver in the men's rings at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens with a score of 9.850. In the same Olympic Games, Yovchev won bronze in the men's floor exercise with a score of 9.775. In the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia, he won the bronze on both floor exercise and still rings with 9.787 and 9.762 respectively. He also won two World Championship Bronze medals in the all around (1999, 2001). Yovchev made his fifth Olympic team for the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and qualified again for the Rings exercise. He qualified second with a score of 16.275 under the new scoring system, but missed a handstand and finished the final in last place with a score of 15.525. He has competed in many SASUKE tournaments, reaching the final stage in the 8th competition; he did not pass the spider climb in the first 15 seconds, so the walls spread apart and he fell. He is the only competitor to not pass the spider climb in this version of the final stage, other than Shingo Yamamoto who did not complete it due to injury, but his early failure could be attributed to the heavy rain during the entire competition. Since then he has not passed the third stage. He, Krasimir Dunev, and Ivan Ivankov moved to the United States after the 1996 Summer Olympics, staying in Detroit, Michigan as they wanted to compete professionally in the United States. During his career, he turned down proposals to change his sporting allegiance and compete for the United States. He coached and trained in Norman, Oklahoma, and Houston, Texas, before moving back to Bulgaria in 2007. He and his wife, Boriana, have a son, Yordan, Jr. In 2009, he was elected president of the Bulgarian Gymnastics Federation. Yordan Yovchev qualified and participated in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, which was his 6th appearance at the Olympic Games, a record at that time for a gymnast, along with Oksana Chusovitina who also made her 6th Olympic appearance in 2012 (she now holds the record alone, having competed in her 7th Olympics in 2016).

Logo from 2010 to 2014 Logo from 2014 to 2018 Towards the end of the decade, IFC began to expand its programming beyond independent films, producing original series and acquiring cult television series. In March 2010, IFC unveiled a new slogan, \\"Always On. Slightly Off.\\", reflecting the channel's new focus on comedy programming. On December 8, IFC began airing commercials within its programming, a move that sparked controversy among its viewers, and would also begin to censor its programming. IFC eventually reversed its censorship practices and started to air its programming uncut; publicly trumpeting this fact in 2012 by releasing ads featuring showings of back-to-back blocks of movies like the Friday the 13th film series, highlighting the nudity and gore.The Many Faces of Friday the 13th's Jason Voorhees ‚Äì IFC On July 1, 2011, Rainbow Media was spun off from Cablevision into a separate company, which was renamed AMC Networks.AMC Networks Goes Public With Hot Shows, And Analysts Looking For A Sale Deadline New York July 1, 2011. On January 9, 2014, it was announced that the channel's full name had been retired. On November 15, 2016, AMC Networks acquired a minority stake in comedy video website and film and television production company Funny or Die, with plans to integrate it with IFC. On April 27, 2018, the company later acquired a majority stake in comedy venue operator Levity Live. = 2012 Dish Network carriage dispute = On May 4, 2012, Dish Network announced that it would no longer carry the AMC Networks family of cable channels upon the expiration of the satellite provider's distribution agreement with the company at the end of June 2012, citing that AMC Networks charged an excessive amount in retransmission consent payments from the service for their carriage and low audience viewership for the channels. AMC Networks responded to Dish Network's announcement of its pending removal of the channels as being related to a 2008 breach of contract lawsuit against Dish Network by the company's former Voom HD Networks subsidiary (under the company's previous Rainbow Media Holdings brand) (which is pending trial in the New York State Supreme Court), in which it is seeking more than $2.5 billion in damages against Dish Network for improperly terminating its carriage contract; Voom's high-definition channels were carried on the provider from May 1, 2005 until May 12, 2008 when Dish removed ten of Voom's fifteen channels from its lineup and the five remaining channels the following day. Dish Network stated that the lawsuit is unrelated to the decision to remove the AMC Networks channels and that it ended the carriage agreement on its own terms. On May 20, 2012, Dish Network removed Sundance Channel from its channel lineup. Two weeks later on June 4, 2012, Dish relocated AMC, WEtv, and IFC to higher channel positions with AMC being split into two separate standard definition and high definition channel feeds (AMC moved from channel 130 to channel 9609 for the SD feed and 9610 for the HD feed, WEtv moved from channel 128 to channel 9608 and IFC was moved from channel 393 to channel 9607); the former channel lineup spaces occupied by the three channels were respectively replaced with HDNet, Style and MoviePlex multiplex channel Indieplex. The move is believed to be in response to an ad run during a June 3 airing of an episode of Mad Men urging Dish Network customers to inform the company to keep the three AMC Networks channels on the satellite provider, with Dish Network stating that the relocated channel positions better reflect the channels' ratings. On July 1, 2012, Dish Network dropped AMC, WEtv, and IFC from the channel line-up altogether. On July 12, 2012, AMC said in an e-mailed statement that it would stream over the Internet the season premiere of Breaking Bad to Dish customers. \\"Dish subscribers can register online starting July 13 for the show, which airs on July 15. We want to give Dish customers an extra week to switch providers so they can enjoy the rest of the season.\\" On October 21, 2012, AMC Networks announced a settlement was reached between them, Cablevision and Dish in which Dish was forced to pay up to $700 million in damages to Cablevision for damages from removing Voom owned channels off the Dish lineup back in 2008, and in return Dish signed a new agreement to bring the AMC Networks owned channels back on the Dish lineup with AMC returning October 21 and the rest on November 1.

However, IFC Canada has broadened its programming focus to include more mainstream films from large production studios as the U.S. channel has done. It has also de- emphasized the use of the full Independent Film Channel name, instead using the IFC acronym, possibly due to the decrease in the number of independent films on its schedule. , none of IFC's original programming has aired on this channel.

It runs under the San Bernardino Pass between the town of San Bernardino and the town of Hinterrhein, and forms part of the A13 motorway and the European route E43. The tunnel was completed in 1967 and is long. Since the opening of the tunnel, the Val Mesolcina, one of the Italian- speaking southern valleys of Graub√ºnden, is now connected all-year round with the rest of the canton. The San Bernardino Tunnel is part of the A13 as a single carriageway freeway and therefore passes through one bore without a central physical structure. As there is only one lane per direction, overtaking (passing other vehicles) inside the tunnel is not permitted. The speed limit of 80 km/h (50 mph) is enforced by means of speed-check cameras. This road tunnel is considerably less prone to traffic jams than the St. Gotthard Tunnel. The old name Vogelberg may refer to the migratory birds who pass by here every year in large flocks. These have now also discovered the tunnel as a \\"shortcut\\". Sometimes, the traffic must be stopped so that the birds find their way undisturbed. History In 1967, the long San Bernardino Tunnel was opened as part of the National Road N13 (today A13), between the villages of Hinterrhein and San Bernardino. The tunnel connected Eastern Switzerland with the Canton of Ticino, and is the second most important after the Gotthard Alpine crossing for freight and private transport in Switzerland. At the time of planning the current traffic density was not yet clear. From today's perspective, the roadway is very tight, and the ventilation systems did not meet modern requirements. Separate emergency-escape tunnels did not exist. The San Bernardino route served the international area as an escape route to the A2 (particularly after the accidental, temporary closure of the Gotthard tunnel in 2001), although the road leading to the tunnel climbs to 8% and has tight bends, as well as a narrow tunnel unsuitable for heavy vehicles. A major refurbishment of the tunnel started in 1991, and was completed in 2006. The following modifications were made: * lowering the bottom of the centre channel; * renovation of the drainage system (separate system) and the line channels; * renewal of electromechanical equipment; * operational and fire ventilation adapted to contemporary needs; * creating an emergency escape tunnel; * demolition and reconstruction of the roadway construction; * renewal of cladding panels; * repair, while maintaining the traffic flow. The total construction costs amounted to approximately CHF 236 million (approximately 148 million Euros). The Mont Blanc tunnel fire between France and Italy in 1999 triggered a general safety review of road tunnels in several countries including Switzerland. In September 2007, the San Bernardino Tunnel saw the completion of a major safety upgrade. Lighting has been increased and become more evenly diffused, with a corresponding improvement in visibility. Particular care has been taken with the visibility of access points to the reworked escape tunnel, minimizing the risk of escape routes becoming obscured by smoke in the event of a major conflagration.

The subtitle is \\"A Tale of Two Campuses\\", and thus both the title and subtitle are literary allusions to Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities. It is the first text in Lodge's 'Campus Trilogy' of novels, followed by Small World (1984) and Nice Work (1988). Synopsis Changing Places is a comic novel with serious undercurrents. It tells the story of the six-month academic exchange program between fictional universities located in Rummidge (modelled on Birmingham in England) and Plotinus, in the state of Euphoria (modeled on Berkeley in California). The two academics taking part in the exchange are both aged 40, but appear at first to otherwise have little in common, mainly because of the differing academic systems of their native countries. The English participant, Philip Swallow, is a very conventional and conformist British academic, and somewhat in awe of the American way of life. By contrast the American, Morris Zapp, is a top-ranking American professor who only agrees to go to Rummidge because his wife agrees to postpone long-threatened divorce proceedings on condition that he move out of the marital home for six months. Zapp is at first both contemptuous of, and amused by, what he perceives as the amateurism of British academia. As the exchange progresses, however, both Swallow and Zapp find that they begin to fit in surprisingly well to their new environments. In the course of the story, each man has an affair with the other's wife. Before that, Swallow sleeps with Zapp's daughter Melanie, without realising who she is. She, however, takes up with a former undergraduate student of his, Charles Boon. Swallow and Zapp even consider remaining permanently. The book ends with the two couples convened in a New York hotel room to decide their fates. The novel ends without a clear-cut decision, though the sequel Small World: An Academic Romance, reveals that Swallow and Zapp returned to their home countries and domestic situations. Biographical basis David Lodge has stated that the character of Morris Zapp was inspired by the literary critic Stanley Fish.

In 1957 it was reissued as The Prodigy, in the Peter Owen Publishers translation. It severely criticises education that focuses only on students' academic performance, and in that respect is typical of Hesse. There are also autobiographical elements in the story, as he attended and was expelled from the seminary described. Plot summary Beneath the Wheel is the story of Hans Giebenrath, a talented boy sent to a seminary in Maulbronn. His education is focused completely on increasing his knowledge, and neglects personal development. His close friendship with Hermann Heilner, a more liberal fellow student, is a source of comfort for Hans. Heilner is expelled from the seminary, and Giebenrath is sent home after his academic performance decreases in tandem with the onset of symptoms of mental illness. Back home, he finds coping with his situation difficult, having lost most of his childhood to scholastic study, and thus having never formed lasting personal relationships with anyone in his village. He is apprenticed as a locksmith, and seems to find satisfaction in the work; it is visceral and concrete, as opposed to the intellectual abstraction of scholarly pursuit. Despite some personal fulfillment in his existence, Hans never fully adjusts to his new situation. On a pub crawl in a neighbouring village, he and his colleagues get drunk. Giebenrath leaves the group to walk home early. Later, he is found to have drowned in a river.

According to this sound law, an original changed to (a sound similar to English \\"sh\\") after the consonants , , , and the semi- vowels (*uÃØ) and (*iÃØ), as well as the syllabic allophones , , and : : > / } _ Specifically, the initial stage involves the retraction of the coronal sibilant after semi-vowels, , or a velar consonant , or . In the second stage, leveling of the sibilant system resulted in retroflexion (cf. Sanskrit ‡§∑ and Proto-Slavic), and later retraction to velar in Slavic and some Middle Indic languages. This rule was first formulated by Holger Pedersen, and it is sometimes known as Pedersen's law, although this term is also applied to another sound law concerning stress in the Balto-Slavic languages. The name \\"ruki\\" comes from the sounds (r, u, K, i) which triggered the sound change. The law is stated as a mnemonic rule because the word ruki means hands or arms in many Slavic languages. Applications to language groups The rule was originally formulated for Sanskrit. It was later proposed to be valid in some degree for all satem languages, and exceptionless for the Indo-Iranian languages. (There appears to be one exception at least in some Nuristani languages, however.) In Baltic and Albanian, it is limited or affected to a greater or lesser extent by other sound laws. Nevertheless, it has to have been universal in these branches of the IE languages, and the lack of Slavic reflexes before consonants is due rather to their merger with the reflexes of other sibilants. =Exceptions in Slavic languages= In Slavic languages the process is regular before a vowel, but it does not take place before consonants. The final result is the voiceless velar fricative , which is even more retracted than the . This velar fricative changed back into before a front vowel or the palatal approximant . =Exceptions in Indo-Iranian languages= In Indo-Iranian *r and *l merged, and the change worked even after the new sound; e.g. Avestan kar≈°-, Sanskrit k√°r·π£ati 'to plough' < PIE . This has been cited as evidence by many scholars as an argument for the later influence of Iranian languages on Proto-Slavic. There are obvious drawbacks in the theory. First, the two sounds must have been very close (r/l), so that both could have triggered the change in Indo-Iranian. Second, there are no real examples of this change working in Slavic, and it is also doubtful that only this change (ruki) and no other such change of sibilants (e.g. > h) was borrowed into Slavic. The syllabic laryngeal *HÃ• becomes *i in Proto-Indo- Iranian, and this also triggered RUKI.F. B. J. Kuiper. 1976. \\"Old East Iranian dialects.\\" Indo-Iranian Journal 18, p. 242.

During this period, according to Jaspers' concept, new ways of thinking appeared in Persia, India, China and the Greco-Roman world in religion and philosophy, in a striking parallel development, without any obvious direct cultural contact between all of the participating Eurasian cultures. Jaspers identified key thinkers from this age who had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. Jaspers' approach to the culture of the middle of the first millennium BCE has been adopted by other scholars and academics, and has become a point of discussion in the history of religion. Definition Jaspers introduced the concept of an Axial Age in his book (The Origin and Goal of History),Karl Jaspers, Origin and Goal of History, Routledge Revivals, 2011, p. 2. published in 1949. The simultaneous appearance of thinkers and philosophers in different areas of the world had been remarked by numerous authors since the 18th century, notably by the French Indologist Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron. Jaspers explicitly cited some of these authors, including Victor von Strau√ü (1859) and Peter Ernst von Lasaulx (1870). He was unaware of the first fully nuanced theory from 1873 by John Stuart Stuart- Glennie, forgotten by Jaspers' time, and which Stuart-Glennie termed ‚Äúthe moral revolution‚Äù. Stuart-Glennie and Jaspers both claimed that the Axial Age should be viewed as an objective empirical fact of history, independently of religious considerations.Stuart-Glennie J. S., 1873, In the Morningland: Or, the Law of the Origin and Transformation of Christianity ‚Äì Vol. 1: The New Philosophy of History. London: Longmans, Green, and Company, pp. vii‚Äìviii.Jaspers K., The Origin and Goal of History, p. 1. Jaspers argued that during the Axial Age, \\"the spiritual foundations of humanity were laid simultaneously and independently in China, India, Persia, Judea, and Greece. And these are the foundations upon which humanity still subsists today\\".. He identified a number of key thinkers as having had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. Jaspers held up this age as unique and one to which the rest of the history of human thought might be compared. Characteristics Jaspers presented his first outline of the Axial age by a series of examples: Jaspers argued that the Axial Age gave birth to philosophy as a discipline Jaspers described the Axial Age as \\"an interregnum between two ages of great empire, a pause for liberty, a deep breath bringing the most lucid consciousness\\". quoted in . It has also been suggested that the Axial Age was a historically liminal period, when old certainties had lost their validity and new ones were still not ready. Jaspers had a particular interest in the similarities in circumstance and thought of its figures. Similarities included an engagement in the quest for human meaning and the rise of a new elite class of religious leaders and thinkers in China, India and the Mediterranean. These spiritual foundations were laid by individual thinkers within a framework of a changing social environment. Jaspers argues that the characteristics appeared under similar political circumstances: China, India, the Middle East and the Occident each comprised multiple small states engaged in internal and external struggles. The three regions all gave birth to, and then institutionalized, a tradition of travelling scholars, who roamed from city to city to exchange ideas. After the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period, Taoism and Confucianism emerged in China. In other regions, the scholars were largely from extant religious traditions; in India, from Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism; in Persia, from Zoroastrianism; in The Levant, from Judaism; and in Greece, from Sophism and other classical philosophies. Many of the cultures of the axial age were considered second- generation societies because they were built on the societies that preceded them. Thinkers and movements In China, the Hundred Schools of Thought (c. 6th century BCE) were in contention and Confucianism and Taoism arose during this era, and in this area it remains a profound influence on social and religious life. Zoroastrianism, another of Jaspers' examples, is one of the first monotheistic religions. Mary Boyce believes it greatly influenced modern Abrahamic religions with such conceptions as the devil and Heaven/Hell. William W. Malandra and R. C. Zaehner, suggest that Zoroaster may indeed have been an early contemporary of Cyrus the Great living around 550 BCE. Boyce and other leading scholars who once supported much earlier dates for Zarathustra/Zoroaster have recently changed their position on the time when he likely lived, so that there is an emerging consensus regarding him as a contemporary or near-contemporary of Cyrus the Great. Jainism propagated the religion of sramanas (previous Tirthankaras) and influenced Indian philosophy by propounding the principles of ahimsa (non-violence), karma, samsara and asceticism.. Mahavira (24th Tirthankara in the 5th century BCE), known as its fordmaker and a contemporary with the Buddha, lived during this age... Buddhism, also of the sramana tradition of India, was another of the world's most influential philosophies, founded by Siddhartha Gautama, or the Buddha, who lived c. 5th century BCE; its spread was aided by Ashoka, who lived late in the period. Jaspers' axial shifts included the rise of Platonism (c. 4th century BCE), which would later become a major influence on the Western world through both Christianity and secular thought throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance. Reception In addition to Jaspers, the philosopher Eric Voegelin referred to this age as The Great Leap of Being, constituting a new spiritual awakening and a shift of perception from societal to individual values. Thinkers and teachers like the Buddha, Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Parmenides, and Anaxagoras contributed to such awakenings which Plato would later call anamnesis, or a remembering of things forgotten. David Christian notes that the first \\"universal religions\\" appeared in the age of the first universal empires and of the first all-encompassing trading networks. Anthropologist David Graeber has pointed out that \\"the core period of Jasper's Axial age [...] corresponds almost exactly to the period in which coinage was invented. What's more, the three parts of the world where coins were first invented were also the very parts of the world where those sages lived; in fact, they became the epicenters of Axial Age religious and philosophical creativity.\\". Drawing on the work of classicist Richard Seaford and literary theorist Marc Shell on the relation between coinage and early Greek thought, Graeber argues that an understanding of the rise of markets is necessary to grasp the context in which the religious and philosophical insights of the Axial age arose. The ultimate effect of the introduction of coinage was, he argues, an \\"ideal division of spheres of human activity that endures to this day: on the one hand the market, on the other, religion\\". German sociologist Max Weber played an important role in Jaspers' thinking. Shmuel Eisenstadt argues in the introduction to The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations that Weber's work in his The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism, The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism and Ancient Judaism provided a background for the importance of the period, and notes parallels with Eric Voegelin's Order and History. Wider acknowledgement of Jaspers' work came after it was presented at a conference and published in Daedalus in 1975, and Jaspers' suggestion that the period was uniquely transformative generated important discussion among other scholars, such as Johann Arnason. In literature, Gore Vidal in his novel Creation covers much of this Axial Age through the fictional perspective of a Persian adventurer. Shmuel Eisenstadt analyses economic circumstances relating to the coming of the Axial Age in Greece. Religious historian Karen Armstrong explored the period in her The Great Transformation, and the theory has been the focus of academic conferences. Usage of the term has expanded beyond Jaspers' original formulation. Yves Lambert argues that the Enlightenment was a Second Axial Age, including thinkers such as Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein, wherein relationships between religion, secularism, and traditional thought are changing. The validity of the concept has been called into question. In 2006 Diarmaid MacCulloch called the Jaspers thesis \\"a baggy monster, which tries to bundle up all sorts of diversities over four very different civilisations, only two of which had much contact with each other during the six centuries that (after adjustments) he eventually singled out, between 800 and 200 BCE\\". In 2013, another comprehensive critique appears in Iain Provan's book Convenient Myths: The Axial Age, Dark Green Religion, and the World That Never Was. In 2018, contrary to Suzuki and Provan, and similar to Whitaker, Stephen Sanderson published another book dealing somewhat with the axial age and its religious contributions, arguing that religions and religious change in general are essentially biosocial adaptations to changing environments.Stephen K.

It is in the Gipton and Harehills ward of Leeds City Council and the Leeds East parliamentary constituency. The separate area and woodland of Gipton Wood is in Oakwood, north of Harehills and part of the Roundhay ward. Etymology The name of Gipton comes from Old English, and is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086 in the forms Chipetun, Cipetun and Chiperton. The first element is a personal name, Gippe, and the second is the word t≈´n ('village, estate, farm'). Thus the name once meant 'Gippe's estate'.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place- Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Names Society, 2017). The name Coldcotes, which appears in many street names in the area, means 'cold cottages'. The estate has been light-heartedly referred to by people in Leeds as Corned Beef Island. History The 1817 village was west of the place now called Gipton and contained the Gipton Spa, a bathhouse in what is now Gledhow Valley Woods. = Gipton Pit = The area of east Leeds from Burmantofts and Harehills to Killingbeck, Seacroft, Manston and Crossgates has a history of mining for coal, ironstone and fireclay, with a large number of pits. Gipton Pit and the railway serving it opened around 1891/92. It was owned by the Low Moor Coal and Iron Company of Bradford who held extensive mineral leases in the Harehills area. The original lease was for 40 years and covered the extraction of coal and ironstone under land at Potter Newton and Coldcotes. In 1896, the lease was renewed for another 40 years. The pit was sunk in wooded farmland between Harehills Lane and Oakwood Lane. The Low Moor Colliery Railway that linked Gipton Pit with the coal staithes on Harehills Lane can be traced for much of its original length. At the eastern end of the railway, the pit head buildings, with winding gear, two shafts and railway sidings were just north of where Thorn Mount and Thorn Walk meet. The pit was taken over by the Harehills Colliery Company in circa 1898 and closed in 1921. Much of the spoil heaps have been removed. The only remaining heap has recently been levelled and a new housing estate built. = Gipton Estate = Gipton Gate East The creation of the Gipton housing estate can be traced to the work of Charles Jenkinson, the vicar of Holbeck,Bradford, E., Charles Jenkinson (1887-1949), published September 2017, accessed 20 August 2020 a poor city-centre parish. Jenkinson was familiar with the poor housing conditions of his parishioners and was determined to alleviate them. His chance came in 1933 after the Labour Party won the municipal elections and set up a Housing Committee to oversee his programme and appointed him chair. Work began on the Gipton estate in April 1934 and involved the construction of a \\"garden suburb\\" for the working classes with 2,750 houses with accommodation for around 13,000 people. The project took two years including two roads, one 150 feet wide and the other 125 feet wide with tram tracks in the centre and grass verges at the side. The tracks linked the estate to the city centre. A shopping centre with 40 shops was at the heart of the estate and secondary shopping centres were built at other points. Sites were reserved for churches, schools, playing fields, medical practitioners, dentists, and other public facilities. The scheme would cost ¬£12 million. When complete the estate took on a character which, while not specific to the final plan, remains fundamentally unchanged today.\\"The Working Classes\\", Leeds City Council, Discovering Leeds. Retrieved 20 March 2016 =Redevelopment= In the 2000s houses in some areas were demolished and replaced by a mixture of private and public housing. These included parts of the north of the estate around Amberton Road, Amberton Terrace and Amberton Close as well as parts of the south of the estate around Brander Road and Greenview Mount. The streets to the south of the estate to be demolished had suffered from vacation, neglect and arson prior to demolition. Religious architecture = Church of the Epiphany = Church of the Epiphany The Church of the Epiphany at the junction of Amberton Road and Beech Lane was constructed in 1936-38 with plans that were prepared by N.F. Cachemaille-Day, and is a Grade I listed building. The Epiphany was built by Armitage Hodgson of Leeds, with the foundation stone being laid on 12 July 1937. The church was consecrated by Geoffrey Lunt, Bishop of Ripon, on 14 May 1938 in the presence of Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood. The full title of the church is \\"The Bishop Burroughs (of Ripon) Memorial Church\\", but it is never used. = Church of St Nicholas = Church of St Nicholas Work began on the Church hall in 1938 when 10 acres of land was purchased from Leeds Corporation at the cost of ¬£6,766. 11s.7d by Holdright. The hall hosted dances, whist drives, parties, meetings and jumble sales. They were staged to raise funds to provide St Nicholas' Church and school. Holdright moved to St Stephen's, Skipton and was succeeded as parish priest by Herbert Backhouse who pursued the same course. Their efforts were realised when the third parish priest, Frank O'Driscoll, was given the \\"go- ahead\\". The ¬£74,000 church was opened on 26 July 1961 by George Dwyer, Bishop of Leeds. The church seats 550 and the opening was marked by the celebration of Pontifical High Mass. The fabric cost ¬£58,000 and the furnishings ¬£16,000. There is a high campanile over the baptistery. On top is an illuminated cross which can be seen from the surrounding hillsides. The church is part of Blessed Edmund Sykes parish. = Gipton Methodist Church = Gipton Methodist Church Gipton Methodist Church is a small urban church on the edge of housing estates. The congregation comes from the local area including a sheltered housing complex.

It was run by International Networks, a wholly owned subsidiary of Comcast Corporation. The channel's programming targeted the fast-growing, young, affluent, English- speaking Asian-American community. Genres included the most popular Asian films, dramas, documentaries, music and anime as well as a diverse slate of original programming. It competed in certain markets with ImaginAsian Television. History The channel launched in 1990, and was initially owned by a joint venture of Liberty Media (which had a 90% stake) and JJS II Communications, LLC (which had the remaining 10% stake). In 1996, the two companies founded the International Cable Channels Partnership, Ltd., which oversaw the channel. The channel was sold to Comcast when it purchased its parent company, International Networks (now International Media Distribution) in July 2004. In March 2005, Comcast rebranded and refocused the International Channel to AZN Television, which now focused purely on Asian and Asian- American culture. In late 2005, news of mass layoffs at the network prompted fears that Comcast would shut down AZN.Comcast Trims Staff at AZN Television Centennial Network's Programming Targets Asian-Americans, HighBeam Research, December 13, 2005 However, the network remained on the air and continued to sponsor the annual Asian Excellence Awards, which highlights Asian American achievement in film and television.

It lies about north of B√©k√©scsaba and east of Budapest.  History  The area of the present town has been inhabited since ancient times, due to its good soil and proximity to rivers. After Hungarians conquered the area, B√©k√©s and its surroundings were the property of the Csolt clan. B√©k√©s (the name means \\"peaceful\\") was originally the name of the castle which gave its name to the comitatus, and, like many castles, was possibly named after its first steward. Many documents from the 13th century prove that B√©k√©s was the county seat. After 1403, when the area became the estate of the Mar√≥thi family, B√©k√©s slowly lost its importance and the role of the centre of the comitatus was gradually taken over by Gyula. In 1566, the castle of Gyula was occupied by the Ottoman army, and B√©k√©s fell under Ottoman rule too. The Ottomans built a motte castle in the town, but it was destroyed in 1595 when the Ottomans had to defend Gyula against the Hungarians who tried to get it back. The area became deserted. It was only exactly 100 years later, in 1695, that B√©k√©s was freed from Ottoman rule. During the freedom fight led by Prince Francis II R√°k√≥czi in the early 18th century the area of B√©k√©s was deserted again, for the last time. In 1720 John George Harruckern was granted B√©k√©s county via Royal Deed. He gave privileges to the serfs of the area, and gradually the population grew. By the end of the 18th century, the town already had its present five districts and the Protestant, Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches and the Jewish Synagogue. The buildings of the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches and the Jewish Synagogue are all located within close proximity of each other. The annual floods of the K√∂r√∂s river meant a significant problem until the 1850s when the river was controlled. In 1872, B√©k√©s was re-classified as a village.

He serves as second-in-command to Napoleon, the farms' president (dictator), and is the farm's minister of propaganda. He is described in the book as an effective and very convincing orator and a fat porker. In the 1954 film, he is a pink pig, whereas in the 1999 film, he is a Tamworth pig who wears a monocle.  Allusion  Throughout the novel Squealer is highly skilled at making speeches to the animals. He is also one of the leaders of the farm. Under the rule of Napoleon, Squealer does things to manipulate the animals. Squealer represents Vyacheslav Molotov who was Stalin's prot√©g√© and head of Communist propaganda. It is also possible that Squealer represents the Soviet newspaper, Pravda. This paper was Stalin's key to propaganda, and was very powerful to proletarians (represented by Boxer, the horse).  Squealer's arguments  Squealer takes the central role in making announcements to the animals, as Napoleon appears less and less often as the book progresses. Near the start of the book, it is said that he was very convincing and could turn \\"black into white\\". This foreshadows several euphemisms he uses to maintain the control of the barn through difficult times. He is Napoleon's (Stalin's) key to propaganda for the farm (Soviet Union).  Breaking the commandments and telling lies  Throughout the book, Napoleon and Squealer broke the Seven Commandments, the tenets on which governance of the farm is based. To prevent the animals from suspecting them, Squealer preys on the animals' confusion and alters the Commandments from time to time as the need arises. Squealer falls off a ladder while trying to change one of the commandments in the night. A few days later it is discovered that Squealer was altering the commandment regarding alcohol; which suggests that he fell off the ladder because he was drunk. Orwell uses Squealer mainly to show how the increasingly totalitarian and corrupt regime uses propaganda and deceit to get its ideas accepted and implemented by the people. In the end, Squealer reduces the Seven Commandments to one commandment, that \\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\\". A point is made by Napoleon dismissing the education of the mature animals as a lost cause while Snowball attempts to educate them all (he does focus on the key ideas of Animalism, nevertheless) and starting many committees which are apparently for the good of the entire Farm ‚Äî Napoleon is explicitly stated to have 'no interest' in these committees, instead snatching up newborn dogs to educate them in seclusion. He takes advantage of their malleable minds and moulds them to his liking ‚Äî the dogs show up later as military enforcers or secret police. As the newer generations are brought up with propaganda and the old generations are ignored, Squealer begins making changes to the Seven Commandments. The animals experience a vague feeling of unease, and when Clover and Muriel ponder the changes, they are told that they have simply forgotten. They accept this easily, helped along by the growling dogs that accompany the pigs everywhere. Benjamin alone appears to understand what is happening, though he never acts. If asked, he says that donkeys live a long time, and that \\"none of you has ever seen a dead donkey\\". True to his cynical nature, he continues to believe that life never gets better. He is briefly outraged by Boxer's death but becomes ever more cynical when Squealer again convinces the denizens of the Farm that Boxer was only taken to a hospital. In the end, this works out to Squealer's advantage. Terror and silver-tongued oration fool nearly everyone, and the sole animal who sees through these fronts, Benjamin, is simply too cynical to do anything. This reflected Orwell's view that events in Russia following the Revolution of 1917 had followed an unwelcome path, and that the egalitarian socialism he believed in had there become a brutal dictatorship built around a cult of personality and enforced by terror and lies. Orwell wrote, \\"All people who are morally sound have known since about 1931 that the Russian r√©gime stinks\\".Orwell to Dickens scholar, Humphrey House, letter 1940, quoted in Cambridge Companion to Orwell, p.137 Squealer, as the chief propagandist of the regime, is prominent in the story and Orwell defines the path down which small lies lead to bigger lies. Orwell regarded propaganda as a feature of all modern governments but especially prominent in totalitarian regimes, which depended on it. In The Prevention of Literature (1946) he described 'organized lying' as a crucial element of totalitarian states.Cambridge Companion to Orwell, p.142 References Category:Fictional pigs Category:Fictional politicians Category:Animal Farm characters Category:Literary characters introduced in 1945 Category:Fictional revolutionaries Category:Fictional characters based on real people Category:Male literary villains Category:Pigs in literature Category:Male characters in literature ","title":"Squealer (Animal Farm)"},{"id":"925835","text":"New York (February 7, 1977) Tonawanda, New York (January 30, 1977) The blizzard of 1977 hit western New York as well as southern Ontario from January 28 to February 1. Daily peak wind gusts ranging from were recorded by the National Weather Service in Buffalo, with snowfall as high as recorded in areas, and the high winds blew this into drifts of . There were 23 total storm-related deaths in western New York, with five more in northern New York. Certain pre-existing weather conditions exacerbated the blizzard's effects. November, December and January average temperatures were much below normal. Lake Erie froze over by December 14, 1976; when that happens, lake-effect snow does not occur because the wind cannot pick up moisture from the lake's surface, convert the moisture to snow, and then dump it when the winds reach shore. Lake Erie was covered by a deep, powdery snow; January's unusually cold conditions limited the usual thawing and refreezing, so the snow on the frozen lake remained powdery. The drifted snow on roadways was difficult to clear because the strong wind packed the snow solidly. In addition to the roads becoming impassable, motorists had to deal with vehicles breaking down due to the combination of very cold temperatures, very high winds and blowing snow. In the hardest-struck areas, snowmobiles became the only viable method of transportation. In Western New York and southern Ontario, snow which was accumulated on frozen Lake Erie and snow on the ground at the start of the blizzard provided ample material for the high winds to blow into huge drifts. The combination of bitter cold, high winds, and blowing snow paralyzed areas affected by the storm. Lake Ontario rarely freezes over, which meant northern New York had to deal with considerable lake-effect snow. Coupled with the existing snow cover and wind, this had a similar effect. Winter of 1976‚Äì1977 Weather conditions during the months leading up to the blizzard contributed to the disastrous storm. A high-amplitude planetary wave pattern set up, which was very persistent from October 1976 through January 1977, and involved a ridge over western North America and a trough over eastern North America. In January 1977, this pattern persisted, with the pressure of the strong ridge over western North America being more than two standard deviations from the mean, while the strong trough centered over eastern North America was more than three standard deviations from the mean. A strong blocking high developed over the Arctic Ocean during January, and this moved the polar vortex to southern Canada, south of its normal location. Strong northwest flow between the ridge and the trough resulted in a strong northwest flow in between, which ushered Arctic air into the central and eastern United States. The circulation helped cause record cold for the winter over many portions of the eastern United States, with the Ohio Valley averaging more than below normal. The severe winter was not limited to the northeastern United States; snow was observed in Miami, Florida, on January 20, and snow mixed with rain occurred in the Bahamas. In contrast, Alaska was exceptionally mild: Anchorage averaged above normal and was in fact warmer for the month than Atlanta (half the distance from the equator which set new single digit record lows during December 1976 and January 1977 although no snow fell), whilst it was the warmest January since at least 1937 for the whole state except the North Slope. The Pacific Northwest, located under the strong ridge, experienced unprecedented drought, with all 29 climatic divisions of Washington, Oregon and Idaho experiencing their driest October to February period on record. In western New York =Antecedent weather= During June through September, the Buffalo National Weather Service (NWS) office recorded of rain, which is wetter than the 1961‚Äì1990 average of . In western New York the previously described pattern resulted in snowy and cold weather in the months leading up to the blizzard. Buffalo was a city of about 463,000 people with about 1.5 million in the metropolitan area, the second most populated city in New York State. The first trace of snow of the winter at the Buffalo NWS weather station in Cheektowaga, New York, occurred on October 9, while the first accumulating snow was on October 21. Elsewhere in western New York, lake effect snow was observed in two periods, with up to on October 17‚Äì18 and up to on October 21‚Äì22 (O'Connell 1977). By the last day of October, Lake Erie was , the coldest it had been on that date. November's air temperature in Buffalo was the coldest in nearly 100 years (since 1880), with an average temperature of . November's average temperature was about below normal. The first three weeks of November were quite dry in Buffalo ‚Äì only of precipitation ‚Äì and November as a whole was drier than normal. During late November, some heavy snow occurred, including on November 30 ‚Äì up to in southern Erie County, Buffalo's county. The total November snowfall was recorded as in Buffalo. December was cold and snowy, with an average temperature of . Like November, December's average temperature was also about below normal. December's snowfall was . Daily snow depth readings varied from , with a maximum measured snow depth of at 3:40 p.m. on December 2. Lake Erie froze over by December 14; this was a record. An ice-covered Lake Erie usually puts an end to lake effect snowstorms, because the wind cannot pick up moisture from the lake's surface, convert the moisture to snow and then dump it when the winds reach shore. The wintry weather continued in January, with the monthly average temperature being , the coldest on record (records began in 1870 in Buffalo). January's average temperature was below normal. It never rose to freezing in Buffalo that month, the first January that had occurred. Prior to January 28, the day the blizzard started, it had snowed almost every day since just after Christmas. By January 27, Buffalo's snow depth was . There was continuous snow cover from November 29 until the day of the blizzard, and of snow had fallen that winter prior to the blizzard ‚Äì in January alone ‚Äì well above normal even for a city that averages about of snowfall per year. This resulted in a snow depth of on the day the blizzard started. Low pressure crossed Lake Erie on January 27 and moved to James Bay; it became stalled east of James Bay. Then the storm moved back west over James Bay before finally moving east to the Canadian Maritimes. =Prelude= Even before the blizzard hit, the Niagara Mohawk Power Company (which is now National Grid) had warned that snow was reaching the power lines in some areas of western New York. Also, on Thursday, January 27, severe natural gas shortages forced industries and schools to either curtail activities or to close. The governors of Minnesota, Tennessee, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey had also declared energy emergencies. Early in the week of the blizzard, James Lindner, Commissioner of Street Sanitation for the City of Buffalo, estimated approximately 20% of cars in the city of Buffalo were illegally parked or abandoned, limiting the ability of snowplows to clear side streets and making many of them impassable. A concentrated effort to plow (and tow as necessary) ‚Äì called the \\"Snow Blitz\\" by the press ‚Äì managed to make significant progress on Tuesday, January 25, and Wednesday, January 26, with the help of 960 tickets and 140 tows. Even so, one source notes the side streets in Buffalo were \\"practically impassable\\" on Wednesday, January 26. On Wednesday evening, snow squalls and high winds hit Wyoming, Cattaraugus, Allegany and Erie counties in western New York. This snowstorm closed the Buffalo Skyway, Fuhrmann Boulevard ‚Äì a major route to the suburbs south of the city ‚Äì and many other roads, and forced snow removal crews to focus on the major and secondary roads Wednesday night and Thursday. Many motorists were stranded on Fuhrmann Boulevard and were rescued by police and firefighters overnight Wednesday. The clearing of snow from this storm was made difficult by winds, which in one case on Thursday, January 27, transformed a clear road to one with drifts in less than an hour. The Greater Buffalo International Airport closed Thursday, January 27. By late January, snow removal was hampered; 33 of the city's 79 snow plows were in for repairs. On the afternoon of Thursday, January 27, the National Guard had been called to the region with equipment to help clear the streets of snow. =Onset= Friday morning On Thursday, January 27, an Arctic front had swept southward through the northern Great Plains to the Midwest. Between 6:00 and 7:00 am on Friday, January 28, a wall of snow accompanied the cold front's passage through Indianapolis, Indiana, along with a temperature drop of almost . Between 7:00 and 8:00 am, Columbus, Ohio, reported similar situations. Toledo and Cleveland, Ohio, as well as Erie, Pennsylvania, were also hit strongly by the cold front. The NWS office in Erie warned \\"travel might be disastrous\\"; and there were more than 500 accidents in the area that morning. From midnight to 11:00 am, the temperature at the Buffalo airport rose from . Snow began around 5:00 am, with about of new snow prior to the beginning of the blizzard. At 4:00 am, the Buffalo NWS office indicated \\"very strong winds will once again produce near blizzard conditions beginning late this afternoon and continuing tonight\\". At 11:00 am, a blizzard warning was issued, which was the first time the Buffalo NWS office had done this. That morning observers on the 16th floor of the M&T; Bank Building in Buffalo watched as a gray wall covered the city; it appeared white as it came closer. A blast of wind hit the building that caused the floor to move and the glass window to creak, and then the wall of white enveloped the building. It was 11:10 am. On the previous day, the governor of New York had decided to use the National Guard and the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to help clean up snow in Buffalo, not knowing a blizzard would hit. Some NYSDOT equipment had arrived in Buffalo while the National Guard was not yet mobilized, but a meeting was being held at the Buffalo city garage that morning to coordinate the efforts. Before the meeting finished, Buffalo city plows started to return to the garage due to a lack of visibility; they reported they were unable to see even their own plow blades. By 11:30 am, most workers in the city of Buffalo had been released early, but few made it home. At 11:35 am, lightning was seen in the darkening sky. Accessed 3/3/2010 The white wall of snow reached the airport around 11:30 am. associated with the cold front. Winds increased to , gusting to , with visibility dropping from to 0 where it stayed until 12:50 am the next day. Three airplanes on the tarmac at the Greater Buffalo International Airport in Cheektowaga were waiting to take off when the blizzard hit. One of them idled for five minutes due to the blizzard hitting; this resulted in the nose wheel freezing and preventing it from turning around. It took several hours to bring the three airplanes back to the terminal since they had to do this via radio communication. The limited visibility prevented the pilots from seeing the men on the ground who would normally guide the airplane. Friday afternoon During the four hours after the blizzard hit, the temperature at the Buffalo airport (where the Buffalo office of the NWS is) fell from . Snow built up rapidly, with bumper- high snow being reported by 1:00 pm and high drifts by nightfall in the City of Buffalo. The depth of snow quickly caused many roads to become impassable (within 30 minutes in the part of Buffalo nearest Lake Erie), and the blowing snow caused extremely low visibilities, making travel nearly impossible. In addition to the roads becoming impassable, motorists also had to deal with vehicles breaking down due to the combination of very cold temperatures, very high winds, and blowing snow. For example, a maintenance pickup truck at the Buffalo airport had snow blasted into the engine compartment that then melted, saturated the spark plugs, and stalled the engine. A report from Welland, Ontario, (see section below for a description of the blizzard in Canada) indicated many cars overheated when snow got under the radiator, melted, and then refroze, interfering with the fan. Those attempting to travel by foot also found travel very difficult with the high winds, low visibility, deep snow, and very low wind chills. Visibility had dropped from ; winds had increased to , with gusts up to . Pedestrians were knocked down by the wind in city streets and struggled to regain footing, so pairs of policemen pulled them into buildings. People formed human chains from the Memorial Auditorium to people stranded in cars so the motorists would not get lost trying to find shelter. Locations west of Buffalo that were hit by the cold front only were affected for two to three hours,= and western New York was thought to be the same. By 1:30 pm, Buffalo radar indicated almost no snow, and it became clear snow was being blown off frozen Lake Erie. Since the lake had frozen in December, the snow that fell had built up on the lake [recall the Buffalo airport reported of snow in January prior to the blizzard]. Lake Erie was reported to be covered by 'deep, powdery snow' at the beginning of the blizzard. During January, the unusually cold conditions limited thawing and freezing, and thus the snow on the ground (and frozen lake) did not consolidate into a form that would limit drifting. The new snow associated with the cold front and the snow that had accumulated on land and frozen Lake Erie were all blown by the strong winds and created drifts of over in metropolitan Buffalo. During the blizzard, about of \\"new\\" snow fell, and much of this was thought to be from snow that had been in the snowpack on Lake Erie. The drifted snow from the blizzard was difficult to clear for reasons illuminated by NWS meteorologist Ben Kolker: \\"The wind was so strong that it packed the snow. It broke the snow crystals up so they really packed in solidly, almost like a form of cement\\". As discussed later in this article, normal snow clearing methods could not be used in many cases due to the height of the drifts and the tight packing of the snow. Friday evening The worst conditions of the blizzard in Buffalo occurred during the late afternoon of Friday, January 28, as winds averaged and gusted to 60 knots [] with wind chills of (NWS pre-2001 wind chill calculation method). That night people stayed in whatever shelter they could find, with 700 people staying in the Donovan State Office Building, 200 in the Rath Building, 300 in the Memorial Auditorium, etc. Authorities estimated 13,000 people were stranded Friday night in downtown Buffalo and that many in the surrounding areas as well ‚Äî e.g. 1,700 at Bell Aerosystems in Wheatfield, 2,500 at Harrison Radiator Company in Lockport. With many roads becoming impassable, the City of Buffalo police were almost immobile by Friday evening. Through radio and television, citizens were asked to loan snowmobiles and four-wheel drive vehicles to the Buffalo police; police used them to answer calls. Looting broke out and items stolen included radios and firefighters' clothing from fire trucks, as well as more than $1,500 in medical supplies from a stuck ambulance. Cigarettes, liquor, beer, coffee, meat and refrigerators were stolen from abandoned semi- trailer trucks. There was also looting from factories, stores (including two jewelry stores and a furniture/appliance store) and homes. Nearly 100 people were arrested for looting. A fire broke out at Whitney Place and Virginia Street, in the City of Buffalo, on Friday evening. Fire trucks rammed through stalled cars in an attempt to get to the scene and fire hoses were stretched two to three blocks to reach the fire, as that is as far as the fire trucks were able to make it. The National Guard assisted in taking firemen to the scene in four-wheel drive vehicles. Not only did the weather frustrate efforts to reach the scene, but also it hampered the ability to fight the fire. Attempts to disconnect hoses to move them resulted in the water freezing and bursting the hoses. Since the street drains were blocked with snow, runoff water from the fire rose to the running boards on the fire department's pumpers. When this water froze, it required jackhammers to extricate the pumpers. Hoses also had to be removed with jackhammers. Some fire truck pumpers stalled in the snow when wind blew into the engines or they ran out of fuel. Since their design necessitated the use of water instead of antifreeze as a coolant, the water in the pumper froze and ruined them. The fire was eventually extinguished, but not before six or seven houses were destroyed and 50 people left homeless. Virginia Street and Whitney Place were closed for more than two weeks following the fire due to vehicles stuck in the ice. Firemen used snowmobiles to rescue trapped people, and to transport nurses and doctors to the hospitals; they also used four-wheel drive vehicles to deliver medicine. On Friday, volunteers on four-wheel drive vehicles and snowmobiles delivered food (a few thousand dollars worth every 45 minutes) for the Salvation Army from their Buffalo headquarters. The Red Cross opened eight shelters in Erie County, New York, on Friday, and snowmobile clubs provided volunteers to deliver food, blood and medicine. Snowmobiles were also used to rescue people from the Skyway, as well as from another expressway. =Duration and cleanup= Saturday, January 29 By midnight Friday, an estimated 2,000 cars were stranded on Main Street and about 8,000 on other streets in the City of Buffalo. By Saturday morning, visibility improved and the City sent their plows back out. The many abandoned cars made their job more difficult. By 6:00 am, Buffalo's Commissioner of Street Sanitation had 30 private tow trucks removing vehicles; later in the day, the number would rise to 50. Saturday afternoon, dump trucks and payloaders dumped snow into the Niagara River. On Saturday, blizzard conditions prevailed and the Buffalo Courier-Express did not publish for the first time in its 143-year history, and The Buffalo Evening News published only 10,000 copies. On Friday, January 28, New York State Governor Hugh L. Carey requested that portions of New York State be declared a major disaster area; on Saturday, President Jimmy Carter declared an \\"emergency\\" for all of New York and Pennsylvania that resulted in a declaration of emergency specifically for the western New York counties of Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, and Niagara. At 11:10 am, during a short break in the storm, a National Guard C-130 was able to land at the Buffalo Airport. A record low for the date, was set, breaking the old record set in 1885, and a peak wind gust of was recorded. During midafternoon, the lull in the storm ended and the winds once again blew strong, causing new drifting. The storm continued; the low-pressure center with which the cold front was associated stalled east of James Bay and then \\"moved back west over James Bay before finally moving east to the Canadian Maritimes\\". Sunday, January 30 Early Sunday morning, the wind and snow decreased somewhat and the sun was seen at times. Buffalo city plows and NYSDOT equipment were able to open several major roads (Main, Broadway, Michigan, Sycamore, Walden, Fillmore, Ohio, and much of South Park and Delaware). President Carter appointed Federal Disaster Assistance Administration Region II (Northeast) Director, Thomas Casey, as the federal coordinating officer in charge of the U.S. federal government response to the blizzard; Casey arrived with New York Governor Hugh Carey at the Buffalo airport in a C-130 at noon Sunday. With the weather clearing and single lanes cleared on some roads, many sightseers drove into Buffalo. At 3:00 pm, the wind increased and blowing snow once again decreased visibility such that driving became treacherous. Hundreds were stranded anew and their abandoned cars blocked roads that had been cleared. A peak gust of was recorded at the Buffalo airport (NWS Buffalo Office 2006a) and that night the wind chill fell to (NWS pre-2001 wind chill calculation method). At 8:00 pm, the National Guardsmen, in their cold-weather gear, began assisting the City of Buffalo Street Sanitation Department with clearing roads to Buffalo hospitals. Since Friday afternoon, walking multiple blocks had been necessary to reach most hospitals. Before the end of the storm, over 500 National Guardsmen were helping in the disaster. By evening, some areas of western New York had, along with banning traffic, also banned snowmobiles; a snowmobiler was injured in a collision with a chimney on top of a house, and others had come dangerously close to power lines due to the high drifts. In Newstead approximately drifts led to the suspension of even emergency snowmobile traffic due to the power line danger. Monday, January 31 C-5A at Niagara Falls International Airport Many towns in western New York banned unnecessary travel for several days. Driving bans during the storm were imposed in the cities of Niagara Falls and Buffalo, Niagara County, and many other locations. Most roads in Cheektowaga were closed by snow overnight Sunday, and the fire department was \\"checking houses snow-covered to their roofs to make sure nobody was freezing or suffocating\\". The supervisor of the Town of Clarence, in addition to ordering all motorists ticketed, authorized the fire department to seize gasoline to prevent driving, if necessary. In Lancaster, only two north-south routes were open. An early Sunday morning helicopter tour by Erie County Sheriff Ken Braun had revealed about 125 cars and trucks almost totally buried in the Lancaster area, as well as a young man leaning against a street light strung across an intersection. Some towns were using metal detectors to locate buried cars before using heavy equipment to clear the snow. Light snow fell throughout Monday, with variable winds gusting at times to more than with a peak gust of at the Buffalo airport. Only 20 of the usual 400 Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority buses were running, and those were reserved for necessary travel. From when the blizzard struck Friday until Monday, there were no intercity bus, Amtrak train and commercial air services to Buffalo. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) had been brought in by the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration to assist in the cleanup effort; they received a mission statement on Sunday for emergency snow removal. The USACE named their effort \\"Operation Snow Go 1977\\", and got their first contractor to start clearing snow on Monday. Three hundred U.S. Army soldiers from an engineer battalion at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, joined the effort. During Monday night, police continued searching vehicles stranded since Friday, and the wind increased again to . Next seven days On Tuesday, February 1, Buffalo Mayor Makowski declared a state of emergency that prohibited nonessential travel. Violation of the travel ban could potentially result in a US$500 fine and 90 days in jail, which was sufficient to limit the number of people ticketed to 97. Following a Monday request by New York Governor Carey, on Tuesday, Tom Casey added Orleans, Genesee, and Wyoming counties in western New York and Jefferson and Lewis counties in northern New York to the emergency declaration. On Tuesday afternoon, the winds diminished to about , and the sun came out. On Wednesday, February 2, there was also occasional sun. Mail service resumed in the City of Buffalo with the help of six four-wheel drive trucks brought in from Rochester, the first mail delivery since the previous Friday. Fuhrmann Boulevard was cleared, allowing workers trapped at the Freezer Queen plant since Friday to leave, and freeing Coast Guard personnel trapped behind drifts at the end of the road, who had been stranded by the snow the night before the blizzard (Thursday, January 27). In addition, many major roads in the City were completely cleared Wednesday, including South Park Avenue, Delaware and Tupper. Thursday morning, February 3, Mayor Makowski lifted the travel ban without consulting state or federal officials, and many people drove into Buffalo. They found the parking lots were not cleared, so left their cars in the roads. This turned many four-lane roads into two-lane roads. The NWS had forecast snow for Thursday, and the new snow arrived accompanied by winds, resulting in near-zero visibility and some areas claiming worse conditions than the previous Friday when the blizzard initially struck. A state of emergency continued or was declared in additional areas, including Alden, Brant, Evans, Lancaster, Newstead, North Collins, Wales, and West Seneca. Many roads in southern Erie County, as well as Niagara, Chautauqua, and Wyoming counties, were drifted shut. At midnight Thursday, Buffalo's driving ban was put back in place. Under pressure from many levels of elected government officials to declare blizzard-affected regions major disaster areas, President Carter sent his son, James Earl (Chip) Carter, and special presidential advisor, Margaret Costanza, to survey the situation on Friday, February 4; the visit included traveling to Buffalo, Lancaster and Cheektowaga. On Saturday, President Carter declared the counties of Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Niagara, Orleans and Wyoming in western New York, and the counties of Jefferson and Lewis in northern New York, a major disaster area; this is the first time a snowstorm was declared a federal disaster area. The previous emergency declaration had resulted in the federal government only assisting in snow removal, whereas the major disaster declaration caused the federal government assistance to be \\"expanded to include everything to protect life and property and to provide whatever materials and equipment that were required to relieve the emergency and restore the area to normalcy\\". The declaration also allowed the local governments to deal directly with private contractors and be reimbursed by the federal government instead of the USACE employing private contractors. On Friday morning, February 4, the NWS had forecast that early Saturday a storm would hit with about ) of new snow accompanied by strong winds, but the storm did not strike Buffalo. That weekend the Winter Carnival in Buffalo was postponed for the third time due to the too-wintry weather. On Monday, February 7, the driving ban that had been in place since February 3 was lifted at midnight. Cars were required to have at least three people in them and a citywide speed limit of was enacted. That Monday, at least 100 residents of Concord (Erie County), New York were still isolated Many colleges and schools in western New York reopened that day, after having been closed since Thursday, January 27, seven consecutive snow days. Since the local governments were now able to be directly reimbursed by the federal government for contracting with companies for snow removal, the USACE was not assigned further work as of February 8; they finished work in progress and completed their contracting efforts on February 13. The coordinator of the federal disaster relief, Casey, pulled out the Fort Bragg troops on February 8. By February 9, the City of Buffalo had signed agreements with private firms to finish the snow removal, a task that would take nine more days. The temperature rose above freezing for the first time since Christmas on February 9, with a high of . The Buffalo mayor also lifted the rule requiring at least three people per car between the hours of 7:00 pm and 6:00 am. The next day, it rose to and then made it to about the next three days. On February 11, Mayor Makowski lifted the driving ban at noon, but the citywide speed limit remained in effect. Buffalo city schools reopened on February 14, after more than 10 consecutive snow days. One school remained open through the blizzard. The Gow School, a residential school in South Wales, NY. Food supplies began to dwindle by Monday, January 31, and so the school's food services had to negotiate with the army for helicopter delivery since the school's own trucks were immobilized by the storm. =Aftermath= The high winds of the blizzard packed the snow so tightly and high, drifts reached in places; normal snow removal equipment was ineffective, and earth-moving equipment, such as front- end loaders, had to be used. Colonel Daniel Ludwig of the USACE stated the \\"snow was very densely packed and that snow plows would be virtually useless on most of the roads\\". NWS meteorologist Ben Kolker noted on one of the roads near the NWS forecast office, high lifts were used \\"to dig away at it and break it up like big hunks of rock\\". In Depew, a suburb of Buffalo, volunteer firemen used a trenching machine to get people out of a house that had been drifted shut. The long cleanup period included the railroads, who used front- end loaders to clear snow from the rail yard into open-bodied rail cars and shipped it east by Conrail. Sixteen of 25 towns in Erie County, as well as the City of Buffalo, declared states of emergency and banned all nonessential traffic at some time during the storm. The USACE normal work force, plus personnel from other USACE installations, resulted in a total of 353 USACE personnel working on the recovery effort. The USACE Buffalo District overall effort (including both western and northern New York) reported $6.8 million used in paying 216 private contractors to plow 3,186 miles of road in 9 counties using about 1,000 pieces of equipment and US$700,000 of in-house costs. Other military assistance included 500 National Guard troops, 320 U. S. Army Airborne troops, the 20th Engineer Brigade from Fort Bragg, 65‚Äì70 U.S. Marines, as well as assistance from the U.S. Air Force. The National Guard operation was entitled Task Force Western, with headquarters at the Connecticut Street Armory in Buffalo, and included providing 9‚Äì10 Army-type ambulances along with operators for use in the City of Buffalo when almost no normal ambulances were able to operate. The Salvation Army fed between 67,000 and 176,000 people, provided clothing for about 4,500, and housed 851, for a cost of US$75,000 to US$150,000, using 1,000 volunteers and over 400 snowmobiles. A Salvation Army official noted the disaster was unique in that \\"it covered 9 counties and nobody could get in\\". The American Red Cross distributed 5 tons (4500 kg) of food at 84‚Äì92 locations, feeding about 50,000 people. The total snowfall for the storm was only . The blizzard was made unique by the sustained winds, gusting up to , which picked up the snowdrifts piled on the frozen Lake Erie and dumped that snow load in western New York and southern Ontario. The winds were accompanied by Arctic-cold temperatures, making it feel like outside Whiteout conditions had trapped people at work, in cars and in homes; some had to stay for a day, while others had to stay for the storm's duration. At the Buffalo zoo, drifts allowed three reindeer to walk over their fence and wander about the city; also, over 20 animals died during the storm. There were 23 total storm-related deaths in western New York, with 11 in the City of Buffalo, plus seven more in the rest of Erie County, three in Wyoming County, and one each in both Niagara and Orleans counties. At least nine were found buried in cars, while others involved heart attacks while shoveling snow, and car accidents. The above-stated death tolls are listed in the USACE report on cleanup efforts in the storm, while a slightly different death toll is listed by the NWS on their Blizzard of 1977 webpage, which indicates 29 deaths resulted from the storm. The Buffalo Area Chamber of Commerce estimated a total economic loss for Erie and Niagara counties combined of US$221,490,000 for the 5.5-day period starting on January 28, with 175,000 people losing wages of US$36,250,000. An estimated $20 million or more was spent removing snow, with USACE alone spending over $6 million on contractors in western New York. Total damage reached $300 million. For 11 days, national media showed images of a city covered in snow up to roofs of houses. Equipment from Colorado, New York City and Toronto, among others, was used in the cleanup of snow. Abandoned vehicles were towed to designated parking areas, and the snow was hauled to dump areas where some remained until early May. Although March was 8 ¬∞F (4.5 ¬∞C) above normal, the snow melted gradually, so there were no significant flooding problems. The storm has become a historical touchstone in the Buffalo, New York, area; anyone who lived in the area during the storm has a story about what they did during it. Southern Ontario The parts of Ontario lying near the northern border of Lake Erie were also struck hard by the Blizzard of 1977. Due to the geographical proximity to western New York and sharing a location on the edge of the frozen and snow-covered Lake Erie, parts of southern Ontario experienced similar conditions. Reports seem to indicate the worst conditions were limited to closer to the lakeshore than in western New York. For example, compare reports in that conditions were much better inland and reports in from a military commander noting an airborne view made it clear the worst was right along the shore, with reports from western New York with snow near street- light level in well-inland Lancaster. As in western New York, the storm struck suddenly during the day Friday, with zero visibility, and blowing and drifting snow making roads impassable, and stranding many vehicles. Looting of radios from abandoned cars, as well as looting of soda pop from a truck was reported. Friday night, 250 people were stranded in the International Nickel Company plant in Port Colborne. Although schools closed when informed of the impending storm, the rapid onset of the storm resulted in about 1,000 students being stranded overnight, January 28, in Port Colborne and Wainfleet schools (about 2,000 students were stranded in the Niagara region altogether). By Saturday, January 29, night at 6 p.m., 800 students were still trapped, with 600 of them in Wainfleet and Port Colborne. On Sunday, the remaining students were taken from the schools with the help of the militia; some students were housed in nearby houses. In some areas, buses had become stranded trying to take children home from school Friday, so bus drivers took the children to nearby houses. Snowmobiles were widely used to deliver aid and provide transportation. Niagara Regional Police Service enlisted the help of 60 snowmobiles and 15 four-wheel drive vehicles for use for regular police calls, as well as to deliver food and medication. Snowmobiles were also used to transport doctors and nurses, and Ontario Hydro workers. In Fort Erie, snowmobiles were being dispatched from all six fire halls to provide aid.Citizens band (CB) radio operators were used by the Niagara Regional Police for communication. The radio station CHOW facilitated communication by allowing people to call in and air needs on the radio, a role confirmed via a plaque from the Port Colborne Chamber of Commerce and scrolls from the Welland Chamber of Commerce. The Canadian Forces assisted in the situation under police direction. For example, the mayor of Port Colborne requested military assistance from the Emergency Measures Organization in St. Catharines that resulted in an Army Reserve Battalion being sent and militia assisting in searching for stranded motorists. In a deployment headquartered at the Regional Police Station in Niagara Falls and stationed at the Lake Street Armory in St. Catharines and the Niagara Falls Armory in Niagara Falls, 156 reserves militia and 9 regular force soldiers helped in disaster relief. Regional authorities requested military assistance on January 29, in the afternoon, and the first unit was called at 3:30 pm, with 130 employed in the operation by the next morning. Their initial priorities were to \\"preserve life, clear main arteries into the communities of Port Colborne and Fort Erie, and try to open No. 3 Highway between Port Colborne and Fort Erie\\". The military was also involved in the London, Ontario, area, with reserves plus a 900-man infantry battalion, but conditions there were not as serious, with four wheel-drive vehicles being generally sufficient for transportation. Areas affected by the blizzard included St. Catharines, Thorold, Niagara Falls, Welland, Port Colborne, Fort Erie and the Wainfleet area, while Toronto and Hamilton were not hit badly by the storm. The Port Colborne area was strongly affected, while Wainfleet was very hard hit, and in particular the Long Beach area and the Lowbanks area were very strongly affected by the storm. As earlier noted, the most extreme conditions were right along the lakeshore with much better conditions inland. In Wainfleet, one resident reported early in the storm the wind broke a window facing the lake and snow rapidly began drifting in the house, which caused significant damage. In the Lowbanks area, a resident reported the storm smashed in windows and collapsed doors; they had lost power and heat and were burning furniture in the fireplace to keep warm. Ontario Hydro noted some power outages lasted 72 hours; it took an average of 24 hours to get power restored for some larger customers. The depth of drifts in the hardest hit areas was extreme. Snowmobilers reported passing over vehicles, as well as onto the roof of a house, without knowing it, and snowmobiling over the top of a school bus without being able to see its roof. In the Long Beach area of Wainfleet, snow reached the power lines, with people stepping over and rolling under them, and only the chimneys of houses were visible above the snow. Along the lakeshore in Wainfleet, the mayor reported drifts up to , and in Lowbanks, a military officer reported drifts of with only the steeple of a church visible. One drift estimated at remained until June 1, while snow banks reportedly lasted until the first week of June in the Cedar Bay area. Farmers in Wainfleet dumped milk since it could not be transported out, and they also had trouble getting feed to their animals. The snow was difficult to plow; one road, near the lakeshore, could not be opened with a big front-end loader or a large bulldozer; instead, a small bulldozer with a bucket took 2.5 days to clear about of road. One resident noted they were snowed in for 19 days before being plowed out on February 14. One effect of the prolonged confinement at home many people experienced in the fall of that year was a marked increase in births at local hospitals (almost 18% in Regional Niagara in Canada). Northern New York Portions of northern New York state, particularly Jefferson and Lewis counties, were also hard hit. At 3:10 pm, on Friday, January 28, Watertown reported zero visibility and wind gusting to as the cold front that had moved through southern Ontario and Western New York advanced through northern New York. The Watertown region received of snow with the cold front, but unfrozen Lake Ontario (in contrast to frozen Lake Erie), along with atmospheric conditions favorable for lake effect snow, allowed snow bands to form that resulted in storm totals of in Watertown, in Mansville, Fort Drum, and more than in areas southeast of Watertown. The snow, along with the winds, resulted in drifts of , and stranded of more than 1,000 motorists. After beginning with the cold-front passage at 3:10 pm on January 28 at Watertown, the blizzard's winds peaked at at 7:00 pm. That night, about 150 people were stranded at the Chesebrough-Pond factory in Watertown. Three radio announcers at radio station 1410 AM WOTT in Watertown were stranded without food, and each of them worked 8-hour shifts to keep the station on 24 hours per day, playing music and taking hundreds of calls from North Country residents in need of services, such as fuel, food or reassurance. Jefferson County Sheriff's deputies brought the announcers provisions via snowmobile on the fifth day of their entrapment. Oddly enough, though the snow was piled up over the roof of the studios on Gifford Road, the morning announcer's VW Bug parked next to the building was totally clear of snow, thanks to prevailing winds. It took him over 5 hours to travel the to his home in Brownville, as only one lane was clear on several of the roads he traveled. During the storm, a Radio Emergency Associated Communication Teams (REACT) CB team set up at the plant to coordinate help for those needing things such as medical assistance, The Red Cross also set up at the factory, and snowmobiles and four-wheel drive vehicles were dispatched. After a lull at Watertown, the storm restarted at 2:30 am on January 29, and lasted until 10:00 pm. This portion of the storm included gusts to and heavy snow. The storm then abated at Watertown, but at 2:00 pm on Sunday, visibility returned to zero. By midnight Sunday, of new snow had fallen since Friday, January 28, at 7:00 am. The blizzard continued throughout Monday, January 31, with an additional of new snow before the snow stopped around 8:00 am on February 1. Due to the lower wind speeds than those that occurred in western New York, the snow in northern New York was not as hard packed according to Ben Kolker of the NWS office in Buffalo. Northern New York did have significant snowfall, though, along with significant drifting. On February 1, Jefferson and Lewis counties were among the counties added to the initial federal emergency declaration, and on February 5, were among the counties declared major disaster areas. The New York District of the USACE assisted with snow clearing by having contractors clear a total of of roadway in Jefferson and Lewis counties. U.S. Marines were at Camp Drum (near Watertown) for cold-weather training, and some of them assisted in Jefferson and Lewis counties with fourteen 25-ton Amtrack vehicles, The National Guard assisted with track vehicles; U.S. Army troops from Camp Drum also helped with disaster relief. Since food and supplies were in short supply in the area by the end of the storm, on February 1, the travel ban was lifted from 7:00 am until noon so 1,900 stranded travelers could leave the area. Agricultural interests were adversely affected by the storm, with the dairy industry hardest hit due to farmers' inability to get milk to market. In Jefferson County alone, about 85% of dairy farmers were forced to dump milk because tank trucks could not reach farms. This contributed to $8 million in agricultural losses. Other problems included barns collapsing from the snow (seven in Jefferson County), feed and grain shortages, disposal of manure, and farmers being unable to reach barns to feed cattle. Five deaths were reported in northern New York as a result of the storm, all due to heart attacks (four occurring while shoveling snow and another in his car). On February 9, about a week after the storm ended, the average snow depth in the Black River basin (about ) which include Jefferson, Lewis and other counties was , having a liquid equivalent of that raised flooding concerns. Sears Pond, about southeast of Watertown, recorded a snow depth of with a liquid equivalent of .

Prussian counts of the Keyserlingk family, in the by in 1882 Alexander Friedrich Michael Lebrecht Nikolaus Arthur Graf von KeyserlingHis full name was stated as Alexander Friedrich Michael Lebrecht Arthur Nicolaus James in the Curonian edition of the Baltic Knighthood book. (15 August 1815 ‚Äì 8 May 1891) was a Baltic German geologist and paleontologist from the Keyserlingk family of Baltic German nobility. Career Alexander von Keyserling was born on at the Kabillen Manor, , Courland Governorate (in present-day Kabile, Kuldƒ´ga Municipality, Latvia), then part of the Russian Empire. His father was Count Heinrich Diedrich Wilhelm von Keyserling, 3rd Count of Rautenburg, was a spokesman, and in Courland, his mother was Baroness Anna Amalie Benigna . His family was of Westphalian origin and was originated in Herford, they were considered part of the Uradel, or old nobility. The first ever mentioned member was Albert Keserlink (1443-1467 or 1468), the mayor of Herford. Alexander belonged to the House of Rautenburg-Telsen-Paddern, which was a subdivided branch of the Prussian comital branch. The branch's founder Dietrich II von Keyserling, Herr auf und , was elevated to count in 1786. Dietrich's father Heinrich Christian also inherited the title of Count of Rautenburg, although Alexander didn't inherit the title since he was the 10th child in the family, his elder brother Otto Ulrich Johann inherited the title. Alexander studied at the Humboldt University of Berlin, here he met with future German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck and John Lothrop Motley, whom he became lifelong friends. Alexander is considered to be one of the founders of Russian geology. He made many expeditions on behalf of Nicholas I of Russia in Estonia, northern Russia, and the Urals (1839-1846). He was also a botanist and zoologist who wrote Die wirbelthiere Europa's (Vertebrates of Europe) with Johann Heinrich Blasius. This work was published in 1840. Alexander's nephews include diplomat Heinrich von Keyserlingk and writer Eduard von Keyserling. Archibald von Keyserling, the first leader of the Latvian Navy, was his brother Eduard Ernst Hermann von Keyserling's grandson. Philosopher Hermann von Keyserling was his grandson. Evolution Keyserling was an advocate of the transmutation of species. In 1853, he wrote an article which suggested that species arose from the activity of \\"alien molecules\\" acting on the embryo. He believed that such molecules were transported by miasma.Rogers, James Allen (1973). \\"The Reception of Darwin's Origin of Species by Russian Scientists\\". Isis 64 (4): 484-503. In the third edition of On the Origin of Species published in 1861, Charles Darwin added a Historical Sketch that acknowledged the ideas of Keyserling.Darwin C (1861). The Origin of Species. Preface to the Third Edition. Darwin sent a copy of his book to Keyserling who was skeptical about the role of natural selection in evolution. By 1886, however, he embraced most of Darwin's ideas claiming \\"I renounced my views which contradicted Darwin's theory, and I consider that the changes of the embryo arise not by means of external action of certain molecules but by the influence of selection and heredity.\\" Legacy Keyserling is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of gecko, Teratoscincus keyserlingii.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

DCMB) is an organization of Dartmouth College. About the DCMB Dartmouth College Marching Band was formed during the 1889 season. Since the 1960s, the DCMB has been a \\"scatter band\\"https://hop.dartmouth.edu/online/dartmouth_college_marching_band like every Ivy League marching band except Cornell's band. During the fall, the band attends all home football games and one away game. For the pre-game and halftime of each game, the band writes a script, intended to be humorous, which is read over the loudspeaker as the band scrambles into a formation which relates to the jokes in the script. During the football game, the band plays during offensive first downs, defensive third downs, and after any points are scored, and supplies various chants and songs. Once football season is over, the DCMB remains active by acting as a pep band at hockey and basketball games,https://www.vnews.com/Dartmouth-men-s-hockey-vs- RPI-32973288https://www.thedartmouth.com/blog/dartbeat/2013/01/as-winter-term- kicks-off-pep-band-gets-in-tune as well as by playing at various special events on campus such as Winter Carnival.https://newengland.com/today/travel/new-hampshire/dartmouth-winter- carnival-2/https://www.thedartmouth.com/multimedia/a3f5c192-43ef-45d7-ab5b-552fcd856198 Historically, the band included a kazoo section as well as a \\"liquid percussion\\" section, in which kegs and jugs were used as percussion instruments.https://www.thedartmouth.com/article/1995/10/kegs-kazoos-and- spirit-its-the-marching-band While the band does have official faculty representatives, the organization is primarily student-run. The \\"Big 3\\" of the band consist of the President, General Manager, and Drum Major. The President holds overarching power, the General Manager organizes on-campus and off- campus events, the Drum Major creates the formations, leads marching, selects repertoire, runs rehearsals, and conducts the band. In addition, other members of the \\"Directorate\\" deal with equipment management, show writing, publicity, social life, supplying music, maintaining lists, and other various necessary tasks. Positions are filled by election at the end of Fall term, with the exception of the Drum Major. Drum Major auditions are held winter term, and are used to select an assistant Drum Major who will aid the current Drum Major and prepare to take over the following winter. By DCMB tradition, the Governor of Hawaii is an ex officio member of directorate, and supreme authority rests with the Coke Machine. The coke machine in Morton Hall was elected to the directorate in November 1988 when Tor Blaisdell ran for president unopposed. Mr. Blaisdell was elected as president, while the Coke Machine became a member of the DCMB directorate. Traditions and history The band continues to play the old fight songs that have been played at football games for nearly a century. These songs include \\"Dartmouth's in Town Again,\\" \\"Come Stand Up Men,\\" \\"As the Backs Go Tearing By,\\" and \\"Glory to Dartmouth\\" ‚Äì collectively known as the \\"Dartmouth Tunes\\" or \\"DT's\\". The conclusion of each game is cause to play the Alma Mater, to which the football team and audience members sing, followed by an arrangement of \\"Hey Baby\\" from the Dirty Dancing soundtrack. Before home football games, the band marches to tailgate parties, as well as through Hanover, New Hampshire's Main Street, playing various tunes in that season's repertoire and the Dartmouth Tunes. Every Dartmouth Night Weekend, the band doubles in size as alumni return wearing sweaters knitted by the Faculty Advisor's wife, and march with the band. Some alumni have come back for more than 50 homecomings. The band demonstrates its only fancy marching during the halftime show, as band members march directly into a \\"D\\" formation. For the senior game, DCMB senior members do a pants-less run across the field and perform the rest of the halftime show without pants.https://www.vnews.com/Dartmouth-football-vs-Sacred-Heart-20857394 =Song repertoire= The song repertoire consists primarily of pop and classic rock as well as some TV and movie theme music, though new additions are constantly being added by students.

It sits in the Headingley and Hyde Park ward of Leeds City Council, though the boundary between Headingley and Hyde Park is unclear; Victoria Road is usually considered to be its northern limit. Unlike the nearby areas of Burley, Headingley and Woodhouse, Hyde Park was not historically a village so its boundaries are inevitably vague. Local people would largely consider Victoria Road, Cardigan Road, Alexandra Road (or Burley Road) and the eastern (University) edge of Woodhouse Moor to be the boundaries of Hyde Park. The area is in the centre of the city's student community, being next to Headingley, another large student community. There are also many full-time, long-term, non-student families and single people, and a sizable South Asian community. Before the dense speculative developments of red brick terraced housing in the late Victorian era, the area was the site of the Leeds Royal Park pleasure ground, quarries, and fields in the estate of the Earl of Cardigan. The Hyde Park name was extended to the new neighbourhoods from Hyde Park Corner on the A660, with that nucleus historically being known as Wrangthorn. Toponymy Street map including the generally accepted Hyde Park boundaries The area surrounding Hyde Park Corner was originally known as Wrangthorn, a name still used in the Church of England parish Woodhouse and Wrangthorn,Wrangthorn, St Augustine of Hippo, accessed 1 May 2018 and at St Augustine's Church, Wrangthorn. The name Hyde Park seems to have been extended to the present area from the name of the road junction Hyde Park Corner, itself apparently named in the nineteenth century on the inspiration of Hyde Park, London. According to J. Landfear Lucas, writing in 1914, > Two suggested explanations have been offered. The first is to the effect > that, in the year 1800, a farmhouse was built on the site of the present > Wrangthorn Church, by Nathaniel Atkinson, whose son John carried on the farm > after his father's death, the land extending from the Cardigan estate to the > slopes of Woodhouse Ridge, John Atkinson and a friend or two took coach to > London, and on their safe return had a meeting in the farmhouse, and over a > bowl of punch solemnly gave the district the name of \\"Hyde Park Corner\\" to > commemorate their pleasant visit to London. The present \\"Hyde Park\\" Hotel at > Leeds was then called the \\"Red Lion,\\" but its name was soon afterwards > changed ... The second suggested explanation is that the builder and > proprietor of certain houses which formed the nucleus of the present Hyde > Park Road in Leeds had named a new street \\"Henrietta\\" after a beloved > daughter. Subsequently, however, he took a journey to London, where, to his > annoyance, he found that a Henrietta Street bore an evil repute. On the > other hand, Hyde Park had pleased him mightily, and on his return he > substituted that appellation, and reserved \\"Henrietta\\" exclusively for his > daughter.J. Landfear Lucas, 'Hyde Park Corner, Leeds', Notes and Queries, > s11-IX (219) (1914), 185-86. DOI: 10.1093/nq/s11-IX.219.185-b. Community The community is ethnically diverse, including a large Pakistani population. In July 2005, Hyde Park became the focus of international attention as police carried out a raid connected to the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Officers used a controlled explosion to enter a property at 28 Alexandra Grove, situated roughly where the Hyde Park and Burley areas meet.BBC News coverage of the suspected 'bomb factory Hundreds of local residents were evacuated as police searched the house, one of six in West Yorkshire to be raided that day. Despite media speculation that the house had allegedly been used as a 'bomb factory' by the suicide bombers, police later said they found no explosives in the property. In July 1995 the area suffered serious rioting after the taking over of a local pub, The Newlands, by the police to be used in surveillance.Davies, Nick Dark Heart: The Shocking Truth About Hidden Britain, Vintage The local community rallied and created Unity Day,Unity Day a festival held in Hyde Park a popular community festival started by the Hyde Park Residents Association held on the adjacent Woodhouse Moor, usually in August. The non-student community is vibrant, artsy and centres around Unity Day, Friends of Woodhouse Moor, Royal Park Community Consortium and other groups. Amenities Wrangthorn Church Hyde Park Corner The area is home to many places of worship; Three mosques, namely Makkah Masjid, the Al Marina Masjid, and the Leeds Grand Mosque, the latter being the largest in Leeds,The Times 24 August 2002, Daniel Crewe \\"At Your Service\\" one Hindu temple, two Anglican churches, namely All Hallows Church All Hallows' Church, Leeds accessed 3 October 2016 and St Augustine's Wrangthorn, and a catholic church named Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church. Alongside outlets primarily catering for the student population there remain a number of smaller shops selling largely traditional South Asian goods. This arguably lessens the impact of studentification, though some community groups do consider this to be a problem and tension exists.List of local residents groups concerned with Landlordism and Studentification from the Heal Headingley Website Cultural facilities include the Hyde Park Picture House, an historic independent art house cinema. The Royal Park, on Queen's Road, is a large public house with a downstairs gig venue, popular with the student population, and next door stands the Brudenell Social Club, a members' club which is a venue for local and underground music. There are also a number of cafes and shops at Hyde Park Corner, including a vintage and antiques store and a Greek cafe. The area has many local or independent shops, such as DIY stores, takeaways, fruit and vegetable shops, two Sainsbury's stores, a Coop and two independent mini supermarkets, a pharmacy, a laundrette, and three vintage clothes stores. The area is close to Burley Park railway station and benefits from good bus links into the city centre and North Leeds, which makes the area popular with young professionals/workers. Woodhouse Moor, which sits between Hyde Park, Woodhouse and the University campus is one of the most used parks in the city. Housing The majority of residential properties in the area are late Victorian and Edwardian back-to-back brick terraces or face onto wide streets with communal access alleyways at the rear. A small area of 1980s council housing lies between Hyde Park Road and Woodsley Road, these replaced terrace housing demolished due to slum clearance. Main roads are cambered and some still retain original Yorkstone pavements and iron guttering.

Origins Adam Loftus The earlier Irish castle was replaced by the present building built on lands confiscated from the Eustace family of Baltinglass because of their involvement in the Second Desmond Rebellion. The Geraldines defended the Pale from the Irish clans in the nearby Wicklow Mountains. It is believed the present castle was built around 1583 for Archbishop Adam Loftus. Originally a semi-fortified and battlemented structure it underwent extensive alterations in the 18th century. The castle consisted of a square building four stories high with a projecting tower at each corner, the walls of which were an average of thick. On the ground level are two vaulted apartments divided by a wall nearly thick which rises to the full height of the castle. On a level with the entrance hall are the 18th century reception rooms and above this floor the former ballroom, later converted into a chapel. Rathfarnham was described as a \\"waste village\\" when Loftus bought it. His new castle was not long built when in 1600 it had to withstand an attack by the Wicklow clans during the Nine Years' War. English Civil war Archbishop Loftus left the castle to his son, Dudley and it then passed to his son Adam in 1616. During Adam's ownership, the castle came under siege in the 1641 rebellion. It was able to hold out against the Confederate army when the surrounding country was overrun. Adam Loftus opposed the treaty of cessation in order the stop the fighting between the Irish Confederates and the English Royalists. Consequently, he was imprisoned in Dublin Castle. During the subsequent Irish Confederate Wars (1641‚Äì53), the castle changed hands several times. From 1641 to 1647, it was garrisoned by English Royalist troops. In 1647, Ormonde, commander of the Royalists in Ireland, surrendered Dublin to the English Parliament and Parliamentary troops were stationed at the castle until 1649 when a few days before the Battle of Rathmines, the castle was stormed and taken without a fight by the Royalists as part of the Siege of Dublin. However, the Roundheads re-occupied it after their victory at the Battle of Rathmines. It has also been reported that Oliver Cromwell held council there during his campaign in Ireland before going south to besiege Wexford. Adam Loftus, who recovered his castle and lands under Cromwell, sided with the Parliamentarians and was killed at the Siege of Limerick in 1651. After the English Civil War, the Loftus family retained ownership of the castle. In 1659, Dr. Dudley Loftus, great grandson of Archbishop Loftus, took over the castle. During his lifetime, Dudley held the posts of Commissioner of Revenue, Judge of the Court of Admiralty, Master in Chancery, representative for Kildare & Wicklow in the Protectorate Parliament and MP for Naas, Bannow and Fethard (Co Wexford). His body is interred at St. Patrick's Cathedral. The eighteenth century Dodder Lodge or Ely's Arch The property then passed by marriage to Philip Wharton. The young man lost his money in the South Sea Bubble and in 1723 the castle was sold for ¬£62,000 to the Right Hon William Conolly, speaker of the Irish House of Commons. In 1742, it was sold to Dr. Hoadly, Archbishop of Armagh, and on his death four years later it passed to his son-in-law Bellingham Boyle. In 1767, Boyle sold the property to Nicholas Hume-Loftus, second Earl of Ely, a descendant of Adam Loftus, the original builder of the castle. The castle in 1774 Nicholas died within a few years, probably as an indirect result of great hardships which he had suffered in his youth, and the estate passed to his uncle, Hon. Henry Loftus, who was created Earl of Ely in 1771. In commemoration of regaining ownership, the Loftus family constructed another entrance for the castle in the form of a Roman Triumphal Arch. The arch can still be viewed from nearby Dodder Park Road. Henry Loftus, Earl of Ely was responsible for much of the conversion of the medieval fortress into a Georgian mansion and employed renowned architects Sir William Chambers and James 'Athenian' Stuart to carry out these works. The mullioned windows were enlarged and the battlements replaced by a coping with ornamental urns. A semi-circular extension was added to the east side and an entrance porch approached by steps, on the north. The interior was decorated in accordance with the tastes of the period and leading artists, including Angelica Kauffman were employed in the work. Writers of the period who visited the house have left extravagant descriptions of its splendour. Henry died in 1783 and was succeeded by his nephew Charles Tottenham. He subsequently became Marquess of Ely as a reward for his vote at the time of the Union. The nineteenth and twentieth centuries In 1812, the family leased the estate to the Ropers and removed their valuable possessions to Loftus Hall in Wexford. The lands and castle were then used for dairy farming and fell into disrepair. To quote a contemporary account from 1838: > Crossing the Dodder by a ford, and proceeding along its southern bank > towards Rathfarnham, a splendid gateway at left, accounted among the best > productions of that species of architecture in Ireland, invites the tourist > to explore the once beautiful grounds of Rathfarnham Castle, but they are > now all eloquently waste, the undulating hills covered with rank herbage, > the rivulet stagnant and sedgy, the walks scarce traceable, the ice-houses > open to the prying sun, the fish-pond clogged with weeds, while the > mouldering architecture of the castle, and the crumbling, unsightly offices > in its immediate vicinity,‚Ä¶The castle, so long the residence of the Loftus > family, and still the property of the Marquis of Ely, subject, however, to a > small chief rent to Mr. Conolly, is an extensive fabric,.....The great hall > is entered from a terrace, by a portico of eight Doric columns, which > support a dome, painted in fresco with the signs of the Zodiac and other > devices.

But, when it is > mentioned, that this structure has been for years a public dairy, and the > grounds to the extent of converted to its uses, some notion may be formed of > their altered condition. In 1852 it was bought by the Lord Chancellor, Francis Blackburne whose family resided there for three generations. The property developers Bailey & Gibson acquired the castle in 1912 and divided up the estate. The eastern part became the Castle Golf Club, the castle and the southwestern portion were bought in 1913 by the Jesuit Order and the northwestern part was devoted to housing. The Jesuits are an order renowned for their education and one of them; Father O'Leary S.J. constructed a seismograph. This machine could detect earth tremors and earthquakes from anywhere in the world and for a time, Rathfarnham Castle became a source of earthquake information for the national media. To the north of the castle was a long vaulted chamber formerly known as Cromwell'‚Äôs Court or Fort. This was apparently a barn or storehouse erected as part of the castle farm and had narrow loopholes in its thick walls. In 1922, it was incorporated into the new retreat house, to which it formed the ground story and its character concealed from the outside by a uniform covering of cement plaster. Not far from the Golf Club House was an attractive little temple built of stone and brick, another relic of Lord Ely's occupation of Rathfarnham. Although rather out of repair, if restored, it would have added much to the charm of this part of the links. Unfortunately, by decision of the committee, it was demolished in 1979. In 1986, the Jesuits sold Rathfarnham Castle but before leaving, they removed the stained glass windows, made in the famous Harry Clarke studios, from the chapel and donated them to Tullamore Catholic Church which had been destroyed by fire in 1983. The other windows were donated to Our Lady's Hospice, Harold's Cross and Temple Street Children's Hospital, Dublin. Preservation The castle was sold to Delaware Properties in 1985 and it was feared that it was facing demolition. After immense public pressure to save the building, in 1987 it was purchased by the State and declared a National Monument. Currently the Office of Public Works is carrying out extensive refurbishment throughout the castle but it is still open to the public during the summer months (5 May - 12 October).Quick Guide to 2011 Opening Times The Castle is presented undergoing active conservation, where visitors can see at first hand tantalising glimpses of layers of its earlier existence uncovered during research.

The current landscape of the park was designed by William Sheppard. It was officially re-opened to the public on Tuesday, 27 July 1880 by Lord Ardilaun. The park is adjacent to one of Dublin's main shopping streets, Grafton Street, and to a shopping centre named after it, while on its surrounding streets are the offices of a number of public bodies as well as a stop on one of Dublin's Luas tram lines. It is often informally called Stephen's Green. At , it is the largest of the parks in Dublin's main Georgian garden squares. Others include nearby Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam Square. The park is rectangular, surrounded by streets that once formed major traffic arteries through Dublin city centre, although traffic management changes implemented in 2004 during the course of the Luas works have greatly reduced the volume of traffic. These four bordering streets are called, respectively, St Stephen's Green North, St Stephen's Green South, St Stephen's Green East and St Stephen's Green West. History Photochrom print showing the green at the end of the 19th century The Green in 1832 Until 1663 St Stephen's Green was a marshy common on the edge of Dublin, used for grazing. In that year Dublin Corporation, seeing an opportunity to raise much-needed revenue, decided to enclose the centre of the common and to sell land around the perimeter for building. The park was enclosed with a wall in 1664. The houses built around the Green were rapidly replaced by new buildings in the Georgian style and by the end of the eighteenth century the Green was a place of resort for the better-off of the city. Much of the present-day landscape of the square comprises modern buildings, some in a replica Georgian style, and relatively little survives from the 18th and 19th centuries. Fusiliers' Arch, erected in 1907 In 1814 control of St Stephen's Green passed to Commissioners for the local householders, who redesigned its layout and replaced the walls with railings. After the death of Prince Albert, Queen Victoria suggested that St Stephen's Green be renamed Albert Green and have a statue of Albert at its centre, a suggestion rejected with indignation by the Dublin Corporation and the people of the city, to the Queen's chagrin. Access to the Green was restricted to local residents, until 1877, when Parliament passed an Act to reopen St Stephen's Green to the public, at the initiative of Sir A.E. Guinness, a member of the Guinness brewing family who lived at St Anne's Park, Raheny and at Ashford Castle. He later paid for the laying out of the Green in approximately its current form, which took place in 1880, and gave it to the Corporation, as representatives of the people. By way of thanks, the city commissioned a statue of him, which faces the College of Surgeons. His brother Edward lived at Iveagh House, which his descendants gave in 1939 to the Department of External Affairs (now the Department of Foreign Affairs). During the Easter Rising of 1916, a group of insurgents made up mainly of members of the Irish Citizen Army, under the command of Commandant Michael Mallin, his second-in-command Kit Poole, and Constance Markievicz, established a position in St Stephen's Green. They numbered between 200 and 250. They confiscated motor vehicles to establish roadblocks on the streets that surround the park, and dug defensive positions in the park itself. This approach differed from that of taking up positions in buildings, adopted elsewhere in the city. It proved to have been unwise when elements of the British Army took up positions in the Shelbourne Hotel, at the northeastern corner of St Stephen's Green, overlooking the park, from which they could shoot down into the entrenchments. Finding themselves in a weak position, the Volunteers withdrew to the Royal College of Surgeons on the west side of the Green. During the Rising, fire was temporarily halted to allow the park's groundsman to feed the local ducks.Michael O'Sullivan, Bernard O'Neill: The Shelbourne and its people (Blackwater Press 1999), p.45 The park is now operated by the Office of Public Works (OPW) on behalf of the Irish state. = Evolution of design = St Stephen's Green fountain in summer The landscaping of the park has undergone three major changes since its inception. Its first major change occurred in 1670: two rows of lime trees were planted around the perimeter, functioning as its first enclosure. At this time, the park was only accessible to the wealthy residents who owned plots around the park. In 1815 the park was redesigned by the Dublin city surveyor Arthur Neville. In his redesign, he added winding pathways and iron fences. At this time, the park was still closed to the public. During the 1860s, the campaign to make the park publicly accessible was underway, and the city engineer, George W. Hemans, proposed a new design to make the park as walkable and as functionally practical as possible. This included creating four gates at each corner of the park that would be linked by the extant pathways designed by Neville. This plan was eventually abandoned, most likely due to the fact that Hemans was employed by Dublin Corporation. However, many of Hemans' designs, like the addition of the gates and connecting pathways, were included in the final plans submitted by William Sheppard, the principal designer responsible for the landscape of the park as we know it today, and engineer A.L. Cousins, sponsored by Lord Ardilaun. Ardilaun also played a significant role in the planning and importing of the exotic trees and plants that would be installed in the park.

The grounds are roughly rectangular, measuring (approximately) 550 by 450 metres, and are centred on a formal garden. cotton lavender One of the more unusual aspects of the park lies on the north-west corner of this central area, a garden for the blind with scented plants, which can withstand handling, and are labelled in Braille. Further north again (and spanning much of the length of the park) is a large lake. Home to ducks and other water fowl, the lake is fed by an artificial waterfall, spanned by O'Connell bridge, and fronted by an ornamental gazebo. The lakes in the park are fed from the Grand Canal at Portobello. To the south side of the main garden circle is more open heath surrounding a bandstand, and often frequented by lunching students, workers and shoppers on Dublin's sunnier days. There is also a playground (separated into junior and senior areas) which was refurbished in 2010. The park once featured a statue of King George II on horseback (erected in 1758) until it was blown up in 1937 by Irish Republicans, the day after the coronation of George VI. Other notable features include: * the Fusiliers' Arch at the Grafton Street corner which commemorates the Royal Dublin Fusiliers who died in the Second Boer War. * a fountain representing the Three Fates inside the Leeson Street gate. The statue was designed by Joseph Wackerle in bronze in 1956. It was a gift from the German people in thanks for Irish help to refugee children following World War II. Up to five hundred children found foster-homes in Ireland in a project named Operation Shamrock. * a seated statue of Lord Ardilaun on the western side, the man who gave the Green to the city, facing the Royal College of Surgeons which he also sponsored (again, see History above) * the Yeats memorial garden with a sculpture by Henry Moore * a bust of James Joyce facing his former university at Newman House * a memorial to the Fenian leader Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa near the Grafton Street entrance * a bronze statue at the Merrion Row corner of Theobald Wolfe Tone, the leader of the 1798 rebellion. * a memorial to the Great Famine of 1845‚Äì1850 by Edward Delaney * a bust of Constance Markievicz on the south of the central garden (see History above) * a statue of Robert Emmet standing opposite his birthplace (now demolished) at No 124. * a memorial bust of Thomas Kettle, fatality of the Great War. The attempt to erect a commemorative portrait bust of Kettle was beset by controversy until it was finally placed, without official unveiling, in the centre section. Notable addresses Iveagh House Iveagh House on the south side was created from the joining of two earlier houses (numbers 80 and 81) by Benjamin Guinness in the 1860s. It was donated to the Irish State by the Guinness family in 1939, and now houses the main offices of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Also on the south side of St Stephen's Green are Newman House (numbers 85 and 86, after John Henry Newman) and University Church. These are home to the Catholic University of Ireland, which was founded in the 19th Century. It is linked with University College Dublin, but is no longer active educationally in its own right. The Unitarian Church, Dublin, built in the Gothic revival style, is located on the West side of St Stephen's Green. Also on the west side is the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (number 123), home to the oldest of the Republic of Ireland's six medical schools. On the west side, at the top of Grafton Street, is the Stephen's Green Shopping Centre, built in October 1988. It was, at the time, Ireland's largest shopping centre. Its style was intended to represent a conservatory on the side facing the Green and to mirror the brickwork design of the opposing Gaiety Theatre on South King Street. On the north side of St Stephen's Green, there were four but are now two clubs (originally gentlemen's clubs): the Hibernian United Services Club (number 8, closed in 2002), the Stephen's Green Hibernian Club (number 9, originally the Stephen's Green Club, prior to its merger with the Hibernian United Services Club), the \\"Friendly Brothers of St Patrick\\" (number 22, now closed) and the Kildare Street and University Club (number 17). This side of the Green also has the historic Shelbourne Hotel and the recently opened Little Museum of Dublin, which is housed in a restored Georgian townhouse. Loreto College, St Stephen's Green, one of Ireland's best-known fee-paying schools for girls, is located at number 53, on the East side of the Green. St Vincent's Hospital, now located in a suburb on the south side of Dublin, was formerly located in buildings on the East side of St Stephen's Green and on Leeson Street. Transport Dublin Bus routes 7b, 7d, 11, 32x, 37, 41x, 44, 46a, 61, 84x, 145, 155 and 757 all have stops along the east side of the square The Green line of the Luas tram system stops at the St Stephen's Green stop on the western side of the park, with Luas Cross City services continuing to Broombridge station in Cabra.

After obtaining his diploma at the Kunstgewerbeschule Z√ºrich, he started working with different magazines, including Elle, Vogue, L'Uomo Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. In 1982 he started working as Art Director for the Benetton Group. One of his most famous campaigns included a photo (by Therese Frare) of David Kirby dying of AIDS, lying in a Columbus, Ohio, hospital bed, surrounded by his grieving relatives. The picture was controversial due to its similarity to a piet√† painting and because critics of the ad thought the use of this image to sell clothing was exploiting the victim, though the Kirby family stated that they authorized the use and that it helped increase AIDS awareness. Other advertisements included references to racism (notably one with three almost identical human hearts, which were actually pig hearts, with the words 'white', 'black', and 'yellow' as captions), war, religion and even capital punishment. In the early 1990s, Toscani co-founded the magazine Colors (also owned by Benetton) with American graphic designer Tibor Kalman. With the tagline \\"a magazine about the rest of the world\\", Colors built on the multiculturalism prevalent at that time and in Benetton's ad campaigns, while remaining editorially independent from group. Toscani left Benetton in 2000. A long-term Tuscany resident, in 2003 he created in collaboration with Regione Toscana a new research facility for modern communication called 'La Sterpaia'. In 2005, Toscani sparked controversy again with his photographs for an advertising campaign for the men's clothing brand 'Ra-Re'. Their portrayals of men participating in homosexual behaviour angered groups such as the Catholic parents' association Movimento Italiano Genitori, who called the pictures 'vulgar'. The campaign came amidst ongoing debate in Italy about gay rights. Toscani unsuccessfully stood as a candidate for parliament for the new Rose in the Fist party in the Italian general election held on 9 and 10 April 2006. In September 2007, a new campaign against anorexia was again controversial due to his shocking photography of an emaciated woman (Isabelle Caro). When Luciano Benetton returned as executive director of the Benetton Group in January 2018, he brought along Oliviero Toscani. In 2018, Toscani became a member of the Italian Democratic Party.

It is possible that Ashur-etil-ilani was a weak ruler as there are no records of the king ever undertaking a military campaign or going on a hunt, activities previous Assyrian kings would famously do very often; this, in turn, may have helped to entice some of Assyria's vassals, such as the Kingdom of Judah, to break free from Assyrian control and begin to act independently. Ashur-etil-ilani was succeeded by his brother Sinsharishkun under uncertain, though not necessarily violent, circumstances.  Background and chronology  There is a distinct lack of available sources in regards to the last few years of Ashurbanipal's reign and the reign of Ashur-etil-ilani. The annals of Ashurbanipal, the primary sources for his reign, go no further than 636 BC.' Although Ashurbanipal's final year is often repeated as 627 BC', this follows an inscription at Harran made by the mother of the Neo-Babylonian king Nabonidus nearly a century later. The final contemporary evidence for Ashurbanipal being alive and reigning as king is a contract from the city of Nippur made in 631 BC.' To get the attested lengths of the reigns of his successors to match, most scholars agree that Ashurbanipal either died, abdicated or was deposed in 631 BC. Of the three options, a death in 631 BC is the most accepted. If Ashurbanipal's reign would have ended in 627 BC, the inscriptions of his successors Ashur-etil-ilani and Sinsharishkun in Babylon, covering several years, would have been impossible since the city was seized by the Neo-Babylonian king Nabopolassar in 626 BC to never again fall into Assyrian hands. Ashurbanipal had named his successor as early as 660 BC, when documents referencing a crown prince were written. He had been the father of at least one son, and probably two, early on in his reign. These early sons were likely Ashur-etil-ilani and Sinsharishkun. The common assumption that Ashur-etil-ilani came to the throne at a young age is based on the phrase \\"my father did not rear me\\" (\\"rear\\" meaning to care for someone until they're fully grown), found in one of his inscriptions. However, the same phrase appears in a prayer by Ashurbanipal and Ashur-etil-ilani is unlikely to have been very young as he is attested to have had male children during his reign.''''  Reign  Ashur-etil-ilani ascended the throne after the death of his father Ashurbanipal in 631 BC.' A land grant from Ashur-etil-ilani to his rab shaqi (a general serving him since he was a young boy) Sin-shumu-lishir suggests that Ashurbanipal died a natural death.' As in many other successions in Assyrian history, Ashur-etil-ilani's rise to the Assyrian throne was initially met with opposition and unrest.' The same land grant to Sin-shumu- lishir references the actions of an Assyrian official called Nabu-rihtu-usur who with the help of another official, Sin-shar-ibni, attempted to usurp the Assyrian throne. Sin-shum-lishir probably assisted the king with stopping Nabu-rihtu-usur and Sin-shar-ibni.' As no sources indicate the opposite, the conspiracy appears to have been crushed relatively quickly.' Excavations at Nineveh from the time around Ashurbanipal's death show fire damage, indicating that the plot perhaps resulted in some violence and unrest within the capital itself.' The spread of inscriptions by Ashur-etil-ilani in Babylonia suggest that he exercised the same amount of control in the southern provinces as his father Ashurbanipal had, having a vassal king (Kandalanu) but exercising actual political and military power there himself. His inscriptions are known from all the major cities, including Babylon, Dilbat, Sippar and Nippur.' Too few inscriptions of Ashur-etil-ilani survive to make any certain assumptions about his character. Excavations of his palace at Kalhu, one of the more important cities in the empire and a former capital, may indicate that he was less boastful than his father as it had no reliefs or statues similar to those that his predecessors had used to illustrate their strength and success.' The lack of such depictions may partly be because there are no records of Ashur- etil-ilani ever conducting a military campaign or going on a hunt. His Kalhu palace was quite small with unusually small rooms by Assyrian royal standards.' It is possible that some of Assyria's vassals used the reign of what they perceived to be a weak ruler to break free of Assyrian control and even attack Assyrian outposts. In 628 BC, Josiah, ostensibly an Assyrian vassal and the king of Judah in the Levant, extended his land so that it reached the coast, capturing the city of Ashdod and settling some of his own people there.' It is frequently assumed, without any supporting evidence, that Ashur-etil-ilani's brother Sinsharishkun fought with him for the throne.' Although the exact circumstances of Ashur-etil-ilani's death and the rise of his brother Sinsharishkun to the throne are unknown, there is no evidence to suggest that Ashur-etil-ilani was deposed and/or killed in a coup.'

Managerial career Withe had a brief spell as manager of Wimbledon, being brought in from the position of reserve team coach at Aston Villa in October 1991 following Ray Harford's resignation. Withe's time in charge was not at all successful, winning only one game out of thirteen in the league, and he was replaced after just 105 days at the helm by the club's youth team coach Joe Kinnear. Withe went into management and, after propelling the Thailand national team towards some success, managed Indonesia until 18 January 2007. He was sacked due to his side's inability to go past the first round of the ASEAN Football Championship, the tournament which he previously won with Thailand in 2000 and 2002, then finished as the runner-up with Indonesia in 2004. He was given a brief touchline ban as manager of Thailand for wearing shorts during an international match against the United Arab Emirates.

In 1715 Ralph Thoresby described it as a village four miles from Leeds and three from Otley, dating from 1540.Ralph Thoresby (1715) Ducatus Leodiensis: or, the topography of the ancient and populous town and parish of Leedes,and parts adjacent in the West Riding of York, pages 157 to 163 A mixture of suburban, twentieth-century private housing and a small amount of council housing on the border with Holt Park and Tinshill, the area sits in both the Adel & Wharfedale ward of Leeds City Council and the Leeds North West parliamentary constituency. Before 2004, the area sat within Cookridge ward, named after the area. Nearby places include Adel, Holt Park, Tinshill, Horsforth, Bramhope, Moor Grange and Ireland Wood. Cookridge is one of the highest points in Leeds with the elevation rising to 198m above sea level close to the water tower on the eastern edge of the suburb. Cookridge holds an annual scarecrow festival hosted by the Leeds Modernians. https://northleeds.mumbler.co.uk/event/cookridge-scarecrow- festival-2019/  Geography  Cookridge is located in the foothills of the eastern Pennines. Elevation ranges from 120m above sea level close to Moseley Beck behind Horsforth train station to 198m above sea level by the water tower. Because of its higher elevation it experiences a cooler, windier and wetter climate compared to many other parts of Leeds, and is very exposed to easterly winds. The Beast from the East in February/March 2018 brought heavy snowfall and severe drifting to the area. Etymology The name of Cookridge is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, as Cucheric. The second element of the name is agreed to come from an Old English word *ric ('narrow strip of land'), attested only in place-names. The origin of the first element is less certain: it could perhaps be from an otherwise unattested personal name, inferred to have been *Cuca, or from a variant of the attested word cwica ('quickset hedge, hedge grown from (hawthorn) cuttings'). Thus the name might once have meant 'Cuca's narrow strip of land' and 'narrow strip of land demarcated by a quickset hedge').Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place- Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Name Society, 2017), p. 38. History and buildings The area had the natural geographic boundaries of the Moseley Beck on the West and South, the Marsh Beck to the North, and the old trackway to the East, running roughly North-South along the line of Spen Lane. A Roman road passing East-West was excavated in 1966 going through Golden Acre Park, south of Marsh Beck. The area later became part of the Kingdom of Elmet, being conquered by the Angles in the 7th century, leading to the Old English name that survives to the present. It was the Danes in the 9th century who named the nearby hill \\"Tyndr's Hill\\", now Tinshill. In the Domesday Book it was listed as the manor of Cucheric, with farmland enough for two ploughs and woodland of 9 square furlongs (36 hectares). In the 12th century, the lands were granted to the monks of Kirkstall Abbey, and in the 13th century the manor became a \\"vill\\" or township, part of Cugerig and Adel. The monastery lands were confiscated by Henry VIII and sold off from 1540; this included Cookridge Grange, the site of the present Cookridge Hall. Early buildings were of wood, thatch, wattle etc., but in the 17th century substantial stone buildings, several which are still in existence, began to be constructed including Cookridge Hall. They used \\"rough rock\\" or boulders which still are still found in the landscape or quarried in fields known as \\"quarrels\\". In the 18th century, Cookridge Hall was substantially remodelled, and many other buildings were improved, with stone replacing thatch. At this time the road through Cookridge became busier with coaches from 1754 and earned money as a turnpike. Milestones and mounting stones from the period still survive. There were also more mills along Moseley Beck, notably the Silk Mill (demolished 1978) which gave its name to modern housing estate. The Hall, along with its flanking screen walls, gate piers and gates, is a Grade II listed building. It was a home for people with epilepsy from 1955 to 1990 and in 1997 was opened by the Lord Mayor of Leeds as a leisure club with a golf course.Leodis Cookridge Hall Country Club Opening Ceremony In the 19th century a new road was constructed (now the A660 Otley Road), and the Bramhope Tunnel dug by Moseley farm for a rail line going north from Leeds to Harrogate. A large house called Cookridge Lodge and a tower added. It was demolished in 1970 to make way for an estate, but the gatepost and some outbuildings survive. The Cookridge Estate was bought by Richard Wormald in 1820 and sold in portions by his descendant Francis Wormald in the 1920s. In 1926 Cookridge became part of Leeds and the building of Cookridge village began in 1927 with a triangle of houses between Cookridge Lane, Moseley Wood Lane and Green Lane. This was largely under the direction of architect Cecil Crowther and his builder brothers, taking advantage of subsidies from the Housing Acts of 1923-1925. Mavis Lane and Mavis Avenue are named after Cecil Crowther's daughter. Crowther acted as estate agent and produced a 1930 brochure entitled Cookridge - Village of Youth extolling its virtues for newly-weds.C. H. Crowther (1930) Cookridge - Village of Youth reproduced in the booklet by Cole (above) This included a map showing 135 plots of an area largely bounded by Cookridge Lane to the east, Moseley Wood Lane to the south, and Cookridge Avenue to the north-west. There were six firms of builders, with different styles. Sporadic building continued, but it was after the Second World War that the majority of the estates were constructed, starting with 1948 Iveson and Ireland Wood; 1952 Tinshill, Silkmill and Woodnook; 1957 Moseley Wood; 1973 Holt Park; 1980 Spring Wood. As the names suggest, these made major encroachments into woodland. The water-tower was built in 1929 to supply Cookridge village on one of the highest points in Leeds at 198m (650 feet)http://www.streetmap.co.uk/idld.srf?x=422905&y;=441255&z;=120&sv;=422905,441255&st;=4&mapp;=idld.srf&searchp;=s.srf&dn;=763&ax;=425500&ay;=440500&lm;=0 above sea level.

The main building and the lodge, designed by Norman Shaw in 1868, are Grade II listed buildings.Brian Godward (2004) The Changing Face of Leeds (Sutton Publishing,Stroud) A further wing was added in 1893, the Edward Jackson Memorial Ward. In 1888 a second set of buildings were opened, the Ida Hospital, named in memory of Ida North, by her father John North. A further similar set of buildings were opened in 1905 named after the benefactor as Robert Arthington Hospital. The buildings mainly functioned as longer-term convalescent facilities for patients treated in other Leeds hospitals, and were used for the care of wounded servicemen during both World Wars. The whole complex was taken over by the Government in 1939 and part used as a maternity hospital until 1942. In 1952 it became part of the NHS. A 'High Energy Radiation Centre', providing treatment of tumours opened in 1956. From then on it developed into a major regional centre for radiotherapy, with the Ida and Robert Arthington Hospitals becoming home to the Yorkshire Regional Cancer Organization in 1994. In 2007 it closed and all facilities were transferred to the St James's Oncology Unit (Bexley Wing) of Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. Much of the site was used for housing from 2010, with the listed building being retained for future development. The Robert Arthington Hospital was refurbished and opened in 2015 as the Lighthouse School for pupils with autistic spectrum conditions.

History  The Old Chapel (Wesleyan, dated 1844) at Bodymoor Heath Bodymoor Heath was originally a separate village but later became inclosed as a part of the parish of Kingsbury. Bodymoor Heath was the centre of a High Court of Chancery case of Barker v. Barker where it was held that the husband of a daughter who had inherited her father's lands in Bodymoor Heath, was not entitled to any dividend just through curtesy. The village later came into the ownership of the twice Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Sir Robert Peel along with the surrounding Kingsbury parish. The village is located near the planned route of the High Speed 2 railway line. The route passes through the Bodymoor Heath Training Centre, which necessitated Aston Villa to relocate a number of their facilities and pitches away from the planned route. Bodymoor Heath has a pub. The pub is called the Dog and Doublet. It was constructed in 1786 but did not become a pub until 1835. The pub was granted grade II listed status in 1981 by English Heritage.

First appearing as an original guest character in the 1996 animated series Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm, he made his game canon debut as the non-playable main antagonist of Midway's 1997 side-scrolling action-adventure game Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero, which was followed by his official playable debut in the three-dimensional fighting title Mortal Kombat 4 the same year. Quan Chi has since evolved into a significant villain in the Mortal Kombat franchise, becoming involved in multiple story modes and character storylines. In the games, Quan Chi is a sorcerer and necromancer from the eternally-damned Netherealm. He is a malevolent opportunist who will ally himself with anyone who can help him further his goals, and his conniving nature has earned him several enemies, including Mortal Kombat mainstays Sub-Zero and Scorpion. As part of the eponymous pair in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, he forms a tenuous partnership with fellow sorcerer Shang Tsung in attempt to conquer both Earthrealm and the otherworldly dimension of Outworld, and plays a notable role in the 2011 Mortal Kombat reboot game as he is written into the continuity of the series' first three titles, and returned in the 2015 release Mortal Kombat X. He has additionally featured in other franchise media such as the television program Mortal Kombat: Konquest and the Mortal Kombat: Legacy web series. General and media reception to the character has been mostly positive, but split in regards to his Fatality finishing moves. Appearances =In video games= In the events of both Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero and Mortal Kombat 4 (1997), nefarious free-roaming sorcerer and necromancer Quan Chi assists disgraced former Elder God Shinnok‚Äîwho had been banished to the Netherealm by the thunder god Raiden after centuries of warring‚Äîin defeating the realm's then-ruler Lucifer in exchange for power and the opportunity to co-rule the realm at Shinnok's side. After another sorcerer, Shang Tsung, reveals the location of Shinnok's long- lost amulet, Quan Chi attempts to retrieve it, only to encounter its four elemental guardians, so he proposes a deal with the Lin Kuei clan of assassins: he would destroy their rivals, the Shirai Ryu, in exchange for the assistance of one of their warriors, Sub-Zero. Quan Chi convinces Sub-Zero and Shirai Ryu warrior Hanzo Hasashi to find a map leading to the amulet's location in the hopes of having them meet in combat, with the Lin Kuei assassin succeeding in killing his rival before retrieving the map. True to his word, Quan Chi eliminated the Shirai Ryu before sending Sub-Zero to find the amulet itself. Once he succeeded, Sub-Zero returned the amulet to Shinnok, though they were both unaware that it was a fake and that Quan Chi kept the genuine article for himself. Sub-Zero later defeated the sorcerer and sent him into exile before stealing the fake amulet from Shinnok. After reviving Hasashi as the undead revenant Scorpion, Quan Chi told him Sub-Zero killed his clan and family. Once Scorpion defeats his rival however, Quan Chi reveals his involvement in killing the revenant's family before attempting to banish him to the Netherrealm, only for Scorpion to take the sorcerer with him. In Mythologies, Quan Chi was assisted by Sareena, Kia, and Jataaka; members of the Brotherhood of the Shadow who served as his personal assassins. In his non-canonical ending in MK4, Quan Chi turned against Shinnok and destroyed him with his own amulet. Quan Chi returned in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance (2002) as part of the titular group. After escaping from Scorpion with the assistance of the Oni Drahmin and Moloch, Quan Chi abandoned his rescuers and fled to the other dimension Outworld; coming across a mummified army of the dormant Dragon King Onaga. Quan Chi brokers a deal with Shang Tsung for his assistance in reviving Onaga's army in exchange for a supply of souls that would preserve Shang Tsung's youth, then eliminate evil Outworld emperor Shao Kahn and the perennial Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang. Together with the assistance of Onaga's soldiers, the Deadly Alliance kills Raiden's chosen defenders and defeat Raiden himself. The partnership dissolves however when Shang Tsung attempts to steal Shinnok's amulet to take control of Onaga's army for himself. While Quan Chi tries to stop him, Onaga suddenly arrives to take the amulet for himself. To stop the Dragon King, Raiden unleashed his godly energy in a violent explosion, seemingly killing the Deadly Alliance. Quan Chi returned in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (2006). After teleporting at the last minute while Raiden tried to kill Onaga, Quan Chi attempted to acquire the elemental Blaze's godlike power. In Armageddon's Konquest mode, Quan Chi suggests he, Onaga, Shang Tsung, and Shao Kahn join forces to defeat the forces of good while secretly working for Shinnok to lead them to the Pyramid of Argus. During the battle royal for Blaze's power, Quan Chi engages Kenshi in a sword fight on the pyramid's steps and stabs him, but Shang Tsung throws him off. Though Quan Chi was not part of the first generation of Mortal Kombat fighting games, he was the only playable character from the three-dimensional era included in both the storyline and immediate roster of the Mortal Kombat (2011) reboot, which retold the first three games' stories as part of a new continuity. In the game's story mode, Quan Chi first appears at the start of the Shaolin Tournament with the resurrected Scorpion serving as his personal assassin.Quan Chi MK9 Biography - Kamidogu. Retrieved September 15, 2014. Scorpion has entered the tournament to seek revenge against Sub-Zero, whom he believes slaughtered his family and clan. Raiden, in his effort to prevent Armageddon, convinces him not to after defeating him in combat, but Quan Chi manipulates Scorpion into doing the deed by showing him a vision of the Lin Kuei warrior murdering Scorpion's clan, wife, and child. He and Scorpion join forces in the tournament to face the Shaolin monk Liu Kang, but both are defeated. During the second tournament in Shao Kahn's Outworld arena, Quan Chi and Shang Tsung join forces to battle Kung Lao, but are defeated. Following this, Quan Chi revives the deceased Queen Sindel in order to enable Shao Kahn to invade Earthrealm, in addition to resurrecting Sub-Zero as Noob Saibot to assist him in his plans. With Quan Chi entrenched as Shao Kahn's second-in- command, the emperor eliminates Shang Tsung and transfers his powers to Sindel, while Quan Chi constructs a Soulnado to take every soul on Earth. However, Native American warrior Nightwolf defeats Quan Chi in battle and kicks Noob Saibot into the Soulnado to destroy it, though Quan Chi escapes. After Sindel massacres the Earthrealm warriors assembled to stop Shao Kahn's takeover, Raiden seeks cooperation between Earth and the Netherealm by offering Quan Chi their souls as compensation, but Quan Chi has already acquired them and transformed into his revenant slaves. However, he inadvertently causes Shao Kahn's downfall when he reveals the Elder Gods are obligated to stop the tyrant for failing to honor Mortal Kombat's rules. Raiden kills Shao Kahn and halts his invasion, but Quan Chi makes preparations for Shinnok's invasion; leading Netherrealm's forces in attacking the weakened Earthrealm and Outworld. In Mortal Kombat X (2015), Quan Chi has built an army of revenants from the fallen Earthrealm warriors to aid him in retrieving Shinnok's amulet over the course of two years. Though he succeeds in doing so with the aid of D'Vorah, he is decapitated by the resurrected Hasashi once he learned the sorcerer conspired with the Lin Kuei ninja Sektor to kill the Shirai Ryu.Quan Chi Trailer Revealed At PlayStation Igromir Event - Mortal Kombat Online, October 2, 2014.

Quan Chi would additionally become the symbol of the first Mortal Kombat fighting title that ushered in the three-dimensional era of the series; Midway character artist Herman Sanchez explained in 2006 that the MK4 cabinet design would serve to reintroduce the series to fans while enabling the machine to stand out in arcades, and therefore a \\"big old Quan Chi face\\"‚Äîa shot of Divizio in costume superimposed against a wall of fire‚Äîwas displayed on both sides of the cabinet: \\"No one could miss it, and that's what ended up happening.\\" The character first appeared in the Defenders of the Realm cartoon and Mythologies as a tall, bald figure wearing a teal-colored bodysuit under a black tabard adorned with ornamental spikes on the shoulders, accented by a yin-yang symbol on the sternum. Designed by Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias, this style was carried over into Mortal Kombat 4, but for Deadly Alliance, the first release following Tobias' 2000 departure from Midway, Quan Chi's design was minimized with him going shirtless and revealing a well-built physique with only a black bandolier across his chest, in addition to simple black trousers and knee-high boots, with Shinnok's amulet usually attached to his belt; this has remained his primary template in all his MK appearances thereafter, while his first design returned as an alternate costume in several games. In conceptual sketches by Deadly Alliance character designer Allen Ditzig, Quan Chi was seen brandishing a \\"mysterious living weapon\\"‚Äîa staff topped with a grotesque head capable of spewing green mist and flies from its mouth. Though the staff was cut from the game, its concept was used in the creation of Drahmin, one of whose offensive moves involved shooting flies at his opponent.Quan Chi Deadly Alliance concept sketches - Allen Ditzig; reposted at Fighters' Generation. Retrieved September 17, 2014. The one element of Quan Chi's design that has remained unchanged is his albino skin tone, with simple parallel black stripes extending upward from his eyelids and extending over the top of his head in his first appearances, then enhanced in Deadly Alliance and onward with an extensive collection of red tattoo-like markings on his head, back and arms, in addition to an elliptical red gem planted in the center of his forehead. For Mortal Kombat X, he was designed by NetherRealm Studios character artist Solomon Gaitan, who initially referenced actor Yul Brynner when digitally sculpting Quan Chi's facial features. His final head render was described by Gaitan as \\"reminiscent of his old look with a new flair\\", while series art director Steve Beran \\"wanted me to merge Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff‚Äôs features\\" during the design process, in addition to researching vultures: \\"I wanted him to feel like he was in a permanent state of lurking and stalking; waiting for death to happen.\\"http://solomongaitan.tumblr.com/post/116921192024/we-are-a-studio- thats-filled-with-artist-who-are Gameplay Quan Chi's signature special move since his MK4 debut has been his \\"Skull Ball\\", a glowing, green skull- shaped blast of energy that he shoots at his opponents; it was waist-high and impossible to duck in MK4, but reduced to life-sized in future installments. Alex Vo of GameSpy considered his specials in Armageddon to be \\"decent\\", but his Escrima fighting style could lead into \\"lengthy attacks which ... can take out more than 20% of a life bar.\\" Quan Chi was unlockable in MK2011 after completing the story mode; Mitchell Saltzman of GameFront described Quan Chi therein as capable of \\"frustrating players with his long, drawn out, and damaging combos\\", while his \\"Teleport Stomp\\" maneuver‚Äîpresent in every game except Deadly Alliance and renamed \\"Sky Drop\\" in the reboot‚Äîwas best used against opposing players who overused projectile attacks. In Quan Chi's \\"X-Ray\\" attack, his opponents injure themselves, starting with smashing their own head with a hard skull-shaped object he tosses at them, followed by a self-inflicted neckbreaker. According to Prima Games, Quan Chi was one of the weakest characters in MK2011, with at least half of their test matches with him won against just three other characters, for a poor 38% overall victory rate.Jason Wilson and Adam Hernandez. Mortal Kombat: Prima Official Game Guide (p. 182). Prima Games (2011), . Bryan Dawson of Prima Games listed Quan Chi in his 2014 selection of the \\"cheapest\\" Mortal Kombat characters, as he had \\"80-percent-damage combos if [players] land a hit and have enough meter to burn.\\" In Mortal Kombat X, Quan Chi's three gameplay variations are \\"Summoner\\", which allows him to summon a demonic bat to use in offensive attacks; \\"Sorcerer\\" allows Quan Chi to create three distinct magical fields, and \\"Warlock\\" allows him more combos with portals. Like his in-game offense, Quan Chi's Fatalities vary from the use of magic to outright brutality. His first in MK4 enabled him to mimic opposing players' finishers, but his second involved tearing off his opponent's leg at the hip and then savagely beating them nonstop with the still-bleeding limb as the screen faded to black for the next match, making it the one neverending Fatality in the series. It was carried over into the 2011 reboot (enhanced with the explosion of the opponent's head in the process), while his other Fatality saw him summoning a sword composed of green energy that he used to dismember and decapitate his opponent, similar to Scorpion's \\"Split Decision\\" finisher in the same game. However, his Fatality from Deadly Alliance, the \\"Neck Stretch\\"‚Äîin which Quan Chi leaps onto his beaten opponent's shoulders and pulls on their head to stretch their neck to an impossible length‚Äîbecame one of the most infamous Fatalities in the series due to its cartoonish appearance and lack of blood or gore. It proved the least popular Fatality among many of the Midway staff; lead storyteller John Vogel revealed that the finisher was \\"a funny idea\\" that was instantly disliked after its addition, but the developers were forced to leave it in due to time constraints. Sound designer Dan Forden cited it as an example of the team at the time \\"getting a little low on creativity\\", and programmer Nick Shin declared that it \\"totally didn't make sense.\\" Boon deemed the \\"Neck Stretch\\" his least-liked Fatality, but called the \\"Leg Beatdown\\" his all-time favorite.Mortal Kombat: The History of Fatalities - YouTube (event begins at 0:00).

He is an independent sorcerer who has an allegiance to no one, and is first seen watching a future vision of the Earthrealm defenders battling Shao Kahn's cybernetic soldiers. When this event actually occurs, he teleports himself uninterrupted to the realm of Zaterra, where he enters a cave and steals a glowing red crystal called the gem of Tetsurri. He then passes through a portal into Earthrealm in the guise of a youth (simply a smaller, thinner version of himself with a head of black hair) seeking sanctuary from Outworld. As part of his ruse, Quan Chi exposes the Earth defenders to the gem when he offers it as a gift. Kitana prevents the team from accepting it, but it nonetheless triggers acute personality changes that cause increased hostility among the heroes. According to Raiden, the gem contains powers that darken the human soul, and its effects will only get worse over time. The Earthrealmers travel to Zaterra amidst much infighting to find and destroy the gem. As Nightwolf was the only one not exposed to the gem, he is able to overcome Quan Chi's black magic and smash the object to pieces, thus breaking the spell over the Earthrealmers.

After Scorpion kills Sub-Zero, he reveals to a mortally wounded Scorpion, that he killed his clan and family and used sorcery to disguise himself as Sub-Zero and lead the Lin Kuei to attack the Shirai Ryu. Shang Tsung later becomes aware of his treachery, when Scorpion turns on both him and Shang Tsung, Scorpion battled Quan Chi and killed him by ripping his arms off, decapitating him and burning his corpse into ashes as the island began to collapse. Literature Quan Chi was a featured character in a special-edition tie-in comic book that was included with the 1998 PC home release of Mortal Kombat 4, where he cons his way into the otherworldly realm of Edenia by posing as a refugee from a realm that, he claims, was annexed by an evil ruler. He offers Queen Sindel a mysterious orb that she accepts, but the orb opens a portal through which Shinnok and his Netherealm denizens (including Reiko and Scorpion) emerge, and they capture Edenia. Quan Chi's machination had been set up in advance with the assistance of the traitorous Edenian Tanya, which in turn established her storyline in the game. He is then seen on the last page awaiting the Earthrealm combatants emerging from a portal into the realm that was opened by Sonya.
