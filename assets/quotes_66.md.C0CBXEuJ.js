In 2009, the claims of Pearson's wealth and investment proposals were reported to have been a hoax. Biography In reports published in December 2008, Pearson claimed to be 24 and from Arklow, where his family owned a Burmah petrol station. By 1998 they moved to Carlow where he claimed to own 'The Foundry' nightclub. (In fact, The Foundry is part of the Dinn R√≠ Hotel complex owned by the McLoughlin family.) Pearson claimed to have qualified as an accountant in Portlaoise around 2008. He moved with his wife and two daughters to County Kilkenny, where he rented a house in Goresbridge and worked in a convenience store in Graiguenamanagh. According to contemporary reports, he was attacked in a robbery on the shop in January 2008. In May 2009, The Irish Times reported that he had separated from his wife, who claimed to have no knowledge of his business dealings; and that locals in Goresbridge were surprised by and sceptical of the reports of Pearson's extreme claim of wealth. The Irish Daily Mail had expressed similar scepticism in December 2008. Purported investments In interviews, Pearson claimed to have inherited money from relatives in 2003. This was reputedly held by trustees until 2008, who were claimed to have invested it in property in Ireland and Britain. The trust was reported to have property in Ireland, to have paid ¬£940m for two retail properties in London, bought several units on Dublin's Grafton Street; and earned up to ‚Ç¨800m from an investment in New York City. In October 2008, Pearson was reported to have been negotiating to buy Taggart Holdings, a housebuilding firm based in Northern Ireland which was in administration with debts reported at ‚Ç¨150m. In December 2008, it was reported that he might invest in Aer Lingus, and subsequently that he might launch a takeover offer of up to ‚Ç¨900m, funded from a war chest of ‚Ç¨1.5‚Äì2b. In 2009, he was reported to be planning to build a retirement village in Arklow, and to start an insurance company. He was claimed to be a supporter of several charities, and in April 2009 he proposed to produce a DVD showcasing investment opportunities in the Carlow/Kilkenny region. In May 2009, all of the claims made by Pearson were reported to be hoaxes, reputedly started to attract \\"attention\\". In some reports, Pearson was described as a \\"Walter Mitty\\" character who \\"[did not have] two cents to his name\\". In other reports, a family member was quoted as stating that Pearson had worked in a fast food take away and as a barman, and was \\"living on a shoestring\\". In August 2009, Pearson was charged with trading without a licence and selling alcohol to underage people.

Chapter VI, The Seventeenth Century to the Restoration, 1660 (page 114).Darwall-Smith, Robin, A History of University College, Oxford. Oxford University Press, 2008. . Life He was born at Sowerby, Yorkshire, and educated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford and Trinity College, Dublin, becoming a fellow of the latter. He received his doctor's degree, and was made professor of divinity in the university in 1621, after James Ussher resigned and the first choice John Preston and second choice Samuel Ward had turned down the position.Alan Ford, James Ussher (2007), pp. 42‚Äì43. A firm Calvinist, he clashed with Provost William Bedell.Dictionary of National Biography, article on Bedell. He was an assiduous teacher in Dublin, covering every book and verse of the bible and, when he had finished, starting again. On the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, he took refuge in London, where he was made vicar of Stepney, replacing the royalist William Stampe.Daniel Lysons, Stepney, The Environs of London: volume 3: County of Middlesex (1795), pp. 418‚Äì488. His preaching was found 'too scholastical' for his London congregation. In 1643, he became a member of the Westminster Assembly, and regularly attended its meetings. He was presented to the living of Sturminster Marshall, Dorset, by the House of Commons in February 1643. He gave evidence against William Laud as to his policy when chancellor of Dublin University. He was employed by the committee of parliament for the reformation of the University of Oxford. On 8 July 1648, Obadiah Walker (a future Master of University College) and others were expelled from the university for their Royalist leanings. On 10 July, the Master of University College, Thomas Walker, lost his position as well. Hoyle was then appointed Master of University College and Regius Professor of Divinity. Hoyle complained about money: a canonry of Christ Church, Oxford, which had been appropriated for the support of the professorship, was assigned to another before Hoyle's appointment, and the income of the Master of University College was small. He died on 6 December 1654, and was buried in the old chapel of his college. Works In support of James Ussher against William Malone, he wrote A Rejoynder to Master Malone's Reply concerning Reall Presence, Dublin, 1641. A sermon preached by \\"J. H.\\", and printed in 1645 with the title Jehojades Justice against Mattan, Baal's Priest, &c.;, is also attributed to Hoyle.

It was set up during the Fascist Italian occupation with the aim of annexing the Greek region into a greater Albanian state and continued its operations under Nazi German occupation until the defeat of Axis Powers and the end of World War II.Kretsi, Georgia.The Secret Past of the Greek-Albanian Borderlands. Cham Muslim Albanians: Perspectives on a Conflict \\"Albanian political administration called ‚ÄòK√´shilla‚Äô was founded in 1942, and after 1943 it was completed with its own armed forces as well as a gendarmerie\\". This initiative was undertaken by the Cham Albanian leaders of the Dino family, in particular the brothers Nuri and Mazar Dino and received support by the majority of the Cham community, who had collaborated with the Axis.Russell King, Nicola Mai, Stephanie Schwandner-Sievers, The New Albanian Migration, Sussex Academic Press, 2005, , p. 67. The policy of ethnic cleansing perpetrated by the K√´shilla and other paramilitary organisations under the Dino clan was used by EDES resistance forces at the end of the war to expel the Muslim Cham community from the region, with the exception of small groups who had not followed them.Mazower, Mark. After The War Was Over: Reconstructing the Family, Nation and State in Greece, 1943-1960. Princeton University Press, 2000, , pp. 25-26. Background Following the Italian invasion of Albania, the Albanian Kingdom became a protectorate of the Kingdom of Italy. The Italians, especially governor Francesco Jacomoni, used the Cham issue as a means to rally Albanian support. As the final excuse for the start of the Greco-Italian War, Jacomoni used the killing of a Cham Albanian leader Daut Hoxha, whose headless body was discovered near the village of Vrina in June 1940. It was alleged by the Italian-controlled government in Tirana that he had been murdered by Greek secret agents. Hoxha was a military leader of the Cham struggle during the inter-war years, leading to him being branded as a bandit by the Greek government.Vickers, Miranda. The Cham Issue - Albanian National & Property Claims in Greece. Paper prepared for the British MoD, Defence Academy, 2002.. Keshilla In October 1940, the Greek authorities disarmed 1,800 Cham conscripts and put them to work on local roads. in the following month, after the Italian invasion, they seized all Albanian males not called up and deported them to camps or to island exile. Under these circumstances, as Italy managed to control Greece after the German invasion, several hundred Cham Albanians formed a local administration called K√´shilla in 1942. These armed bands took part alongside the German army in burning Greek villages. But the local beys and the mufti did not support such actions. In 1943, this organization was completed with its own armed forces as well as a gendarmerie. Although the Italians wanted to annex Chameria to Albania, the Germans vetoed the proposal. An Albanian High Commissioner, Xhemil Dino, was appointed, but his authority was limited, and for the duration of the Occupation, the area remained under direct control from the military authorities in Athens.

The curriculum is overseen by Cambridge International Examinations which is a branch of Cambridge Assessment and operates globally. It includes classes in the subject areas of mathematics and science; languages; and arts and humanities with two levels of difficulty Advanced Subsidiary level and Advanced level with Advanced level being more challenging. It is mandatory for a student to have taken and passed a subject on the Advanced Level. Students need to select subject from 4 different groups (Group 1: Mathematics and Sciences, Group 2: Languages, Group 3: Arts and Humanities, Group 4: Interdisciplinary and skills-based subjects (optional)). Successful completion of the program within a thirteen-month period confers a Cambridge AICE Diploma. Three levels of diploma‚ÄîPass Level, with Merit and with Distinction‚Äîare offered based on the number of points that a student receives; these points depend upon factors such as the grade earned in an AICE class and the level of the class taken. To successfully complete the curriculum, a student must achieve at least 120 points with a minimum of seven credits in courses spread across the subject areas. The United States has identified AICE as a graduation option and acceleration mechanism through which students can be awarded up to 45 hours of college credit. Students earning the AICE Diploma in Florida qualify for the Florida Bright Futures Academic Scholarship while students completing the curriculum can earn the Medallion tuition scholarship.

In computability theory, a Specker sequence is a computable, monotonically increasing, bounded sequence of rational numbers whose supremum is not a computable real number. The first example of such a sequence was constructed by Ernst Specker (1949). The existence of Specker sequences has consequences for computable analysis. The fact that such sequences exist means that the collection of all computable real numbers does not satisfy the least upper bound principle of real analysis, even when considering only computable sequences. A common way to resolve this difficulty is to consider only sequences that are accompanied by a modulus of convergence; no Specker sequence has a computable modulus of convergence. More generally, a Specker sequence is called a recursive counterexample to the least upper bound principle, i.e. a construction that shows that this theorem is false when restricted to computable reals. The least upper bound principle has also been analyzed in the program of reverse mathematics, where the exact strength of this principle has been determined. In the terminology of that program, the least upper bound principle is equivalent to ACA0 over RCA0. In fact, the proof of the forward implication, i.e. that the least upper bound principle implies ACA0, is readily obtained from the textbook proof (see Simpson, 1999) of the non-computability of the supremum in the least upper bound principle.  Construction  The following construction is described by Kushner (1984). Let A be any recursively enumerable set of natural numbers that is not decidable, and let (ai) be a computable enumeration of A without repetition. Define a sequence (qn) of rational numbers with the rule :q_n = \\\\sum_{i = 0}^n 2^{-a_i - 1}. It is clear that each qn is nonnegative and rational, and that the sequence qn is strictly increasing. Moreover, because ai has no repetition, it is possible to estimate each qn against the series :\\\\sum_{i = 0}^\\\\infty 2^{-i-1} = 1. Thus the sequence (qn) is bounded above by 1. Classically, this means that qn has a supremum x. It is shown that x is not a computable real number. The proof uses a particular fact about computable real numbers. If x were computable then there would be a computable function r(n) such that qj \\\\- qi < 1/n for all i,j > r(n). To compute r, compare the binary expansion of x with the binary expansion of qi for larger and larger values of i. The definition of qi causes a single binary digit to go from 0 to 1 each time i increases by 1. Thus there will be some n where a large enough initial segment of x has already been determined by qn that no additional binary digits in that segment could ever be turned on, which leads to an estimate on the distance between qi and qj for i,j > n. If any such a function r were computable, it would lead to a decision procedure for A, as follows. Given an input k, compute r(2k+1). If k were to appear in the sequence (ai), this would cause the sequence (qi) to increase by 2‚àík-1, but this cannot happen once all the elements of (qi) are within 2‚àík-1 of each other. Thus, if k is going to be enumerated into ai, it must be enumerated for a value of i less than r(2k+1). This leaves a finite number of possible places where k could be enumerated. To complete the decision procedure, check these in an effective manner and the return 0 or 1 depending on whether k is found.

Miniature model of the castle's presumed original appearance The Zhovkva Castle (; ) occupies the principal square of the town of Zhovkva in Ukraine. It was founded by Polish Hetman Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski as his fortified residence. Construction began in 1594 and was mostly completed in 1606. The castle had a typically Serlian entrance arch and was encircled by moats (up to 17 meters in width). One wing of the building accommodated the arsenal and stables; another was immediately contiguous to the city wall. In 1606, a garden was laid out next to the hetman's residence. It contained a menagerie with wisents, deers, and chamois. The palatine chapel was consecrated in 1640. The golden age of the Zolkiew Castle was the late 17th century when it passed through inheritance to Jakub Sobieski and then to his son John III, a native of Zhovkva. It was there that the king celebrated his victory under the walls of Vienna. In the 18th century the castle's facade was decorated with the statues of its owners from the Zolkiewski, Dani≈Çowicz, Sobieski, and Radziwill families. After the partition of Poland the castle fell into disuse and was auctioned off. During the 19th century the chapel and some other structures were dismantled or rebuilt to accommodate a local school. The castle sustained further damage during the First World War. Some restoration was undertaken just before the Second World War, but much more was required following the end of hostilities.

It is concerned with the parts of real analysis and functional analysis that can be carried out in a computable manner. The field is closely related to constructive analysis and numerical analysis. Basic constructions A popular model for doing Computable Analysis are Turing machines. The tape configuration and interpretation of mathematical structures are described as follows. Type 2 Turing Machines A Type 2 Turing Machine is a Turing machine with three tapes: An input tape which is read-only; a working tape which can be written to and read from; and, notably, an output tape which is \\"append-only\\". Real numbers In this context, real numbers are represented as arbitrary infinite sequences of symbols. These sequences could for instance represent the digits of a real number. Such sequences need not be computable. On the other hand, the programs that act on these sequences do need to be computable in a reasonable sense. Computable functions Computable functions are represented as programs on a Type 2 Turing Machine. A program is considered total (in the sense of a total functions as opposed to partial functions) if it takes finite time to write any number of symbols on the output tape regardless of the input. The programs run forever, generating increasingly more digits of the output. Names Results about computability associated with infinite sets often involve namings, which are maps between those sets and recursive representations of subsets thereof. Discussion The issue of Type 1 versus Type 2 computability Type 1 computability is the naive form of computable analysis in which one restricts the inputs to a machine to be computable numbers instead of arbitrary real numbers. The difference between the two models lies in the fact that a function which is well-behaved over computable numbers (in the sense of being total) is not necessarily well-behaved over arbitrary real numbers. For instance, there are continuous and computable functions over the computable real numbers which are total, but which map some closed intervals to unbounded open intervals. These functions clearly cannot be extended to arbitrary real numbers without making them partial, as doing so would violate the Extreme value theorem. Since that sort of behaviour could be considered pathological, it is natural to insist that a function should only be considered total if it is total over all real numbers, not just the computable ones. Realisability In the event that one is unhappy with using Turing Machines (on the grounds that they are low level and somewhat arbitrary), there is a realisability topos called the Kleene-Vesley topos in which one can reduce computable analysis to constructive analysis. This constructive analysis includes everything that is valid in the Brouwer school, and not just the Bishop school.  Basic results  Every computable real function is continuous (Weihrauch 2000, p. 6). The arithmetic operations on real numbers are computable. There is a subset of the real numbers called the computable numbers, which by the results above is a real closed field. While the equality relation is not decidable, the greater-than predicate on unequal real numbers is decidable. The uniform norm operator is also computable. This implies the computability of Riemann integration. The Riemann integral is a computable operator: In other words, there is an algorithm that will numerically evaluate the integral of any computable function. The differentiation operator over real valued functions is not computable, but over complex functions is computable. The latter result follows from Cauchy's integral formula and the computability of integration. The former negative result follows from the fact that differentiation (over real-valued functions) is discontinuous. This illustrates the gulf between real analysis and complex analysis, as well as the difficulty of numerical differentiation over the real numbers, which is often bypassed by extending a function to the complex numbers or by using symbolic methods.  Analogy between general topology and computability theory  One of the basic results of computable analysis is that every computable function from \\\\mathbb R to \\\\mathbb R is continuous (Weihrauch 2000, p. 6). Taking this further, this suggests that there is an analogy between basic notions in topology and basic notions in computability: * Computable functions are analogous to continuous functions. * Semidecidable sets are analogous to open sets. * Co-semideciable sets are analogous to closed sets. * There is a computable analogue of topological compactness. Namely, a subset S of \\\\mathbb R is computably compact if it there is a semi-decision procedure \\"\\\\forall_S\\" that, given a semidecidable predicate P as input, semi-decides whether every point in the set S satisfies the predicate P. * The above notion of computable compactness satisfies an analogue of the Heine-Borel theorem. In particular, the unit interval [0,1] is computably compact. * Discrete sets in topology are analogous to sets in computability where equality between elements is semi- decidable. * Hausdorff sets in topology are analogous to sets in computability where inequality between elements is semi-decidable. The analogy suggests that general topology and computability are nearly mirror images of each other. The analogy can be explained by using the fact that computability theory and general topology can both be performed using constructive logic.

Clark is a member of the Reconstruction Party (USA), and is a chair of Grandmothers for the Release of Mumia Abu-Jamal. Civil Rights Clark was a student at Tougaloo College, an historically black college in Tougaloo, Mississippi when she became involved with the Civil Rights Movement. An activist with the NAACP, she was involved with voter registration efforts. Under the guidance of Medgar Evers and John Salter, Clark founded the NAACP Youth Council in North Jackson, Mississippi. While working with the NAACP, she became special assistant to Medgar Evers, field secretary for the NAACP. In 1962 Clark resigned from the NAACP and joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to do voter registration work alongside her then husband, Bernard Lafayette, in Alabama. This project laid essential groundwork for the Selma voting rights campaign of 1965. She was eventually named executive secretary of SNCC. She also participated in street demonstrations and experienced police brutality in the Birmingham campaign of 1963.

The SSSI covers and was designated for its biological interest. The site was notified in 1987. Lindrick Golf Club The course is situated on the A57 running between Sheffield and Worksop, Nottinghamshire, and is approximately west of Worksop. The course is affiliated to the Yorkshire Golf Union and, contrary to local folklore, the entire course and clubhouse is situated in Yorkshire. Founded in 1891, the course was originally nine holes, but was extended to 18 holes in 1894. Prior to the enhancements programme started in 2015, the last major changes to the course layout occurred in 1932, to avoid two holes being played over the A57. The course design has been influenced by a variety of renown architects from 'old' Tom Morris, Alistair McKenzie to current award winning designer Ken Moodie. Currently Holes 1‚Äì11 and Hole 18 are situated on the south side of the A57, with Holes 12‚Äì17 being on the north side. The course now has two tunnels providing safe crossing of the A57. The closing 18th hole features as one of the 500 Greatest Holes in the World and is also listed as one of Peter Alliss' favourite 18 holes of all time. The course plays host to a number of leading amateur tournaments, and is a venue for Regional Qualifying for The Open Championship, and is regularly featured in the various top 100 course ratings in the golfing media. Lindrick is also one of the courses (with Ganton and Moortown) who play host to the annual Yorkshire Challenge which is now one of the biggest tournaments for club golfers in the country The 1957 Ryder Cup was played at Lindrick, resulting in the only post-war victory for Great Britain & Ireland, captained by Dai Rees and in 2016 featured on Sky TV as being the only club to ever have 3 current playing members to represent Europe in that years Ryder Cup team. The Curtis Cup was played on the course in 1960, and the Women's British Open has been held at the course on two occasions ‚Äì in 1977 and 1988, and most recently the English Womens Amateur Championship in 2017. Marian Rae, the former President of England Golf, is a member. Full PGA tour players Danny Willett, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Lee Westwood, Mark Foster and Jonathan Thomson are members as well as a host of Yorkshire and England junior players. In recent years the club have invested heavily in creating custom designed practice areas, new changing facilities as well as a full facelift to the Ryder Cup casual bar area which displays memorabilia of the Ryder Cup and Lindrick's continued association with that tournament since 1957. In 2015 they started a programme to enhance the course with new championship tees, added fairway bunkering and the rejuvenation of all other bunkers on the course with a completion date for the new course of 2020. Expenditure on all the above projects is thought to be in excess of ¬£2m.

On the edition of November 4, 2010 of Takedown, she competed in the \\"Hoedown Throwdown\\" Battle Royal, but was eliminated by Alexandra the Great. Blake in August 2012. Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (2009‚Äì2014) In 2009, Blake branched out into Mexico, wrestling in the Extreme Air Wrestling (Lucha Libre Extrema A√©rea, EAW) promotion. She made her debut on June 6, 2009 in Teziutl√°n, Puebla, teaming with Derrick Nikerson (Neikirk) in a losing effort against John Scott and Ericka del Rico. On June 20, she picked up her first victory by defeating Sensual Rain in San Juan de los Lagos, Jalisco. On August 21, 2009, at Verano de Escandalo she made her debut for Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide, initially using the ring name Jennifer Blade, before returning to her Jennifer Blake ring name. In the promotion she is part of the heel stable La Legi√≥n Extranjera, led by Konnan. At the 2010 Rey de Reyes show her Legi√≥n stable mates Rain, Christina Von Eerie and Sexy Star faced off against Cinthia Moreno, Mari and Faby Apache, a match which Moreno won for her team by pinning Sexy Star. During a post Rey de Reyes interview Sexy Star claimed that the Apaches and Cintia Moreno were nothing but maids, which led to AAA booking a match between Cinthia Moreno, Faby and Mari Apache against Sexy Star, Rain and Jennifer Blade in a Tripleman√≠a XVIII match where the person pinned or submitted would have to be the winning team's slave for a month. At Tripleman√≠a La Legi√≥n defeated Moreno and the Apaches, when Blade pinned Mari, thanks in part to the biased refereering by Hijo del Tirantes. Following the match Konnan ordered Mari Apache to begin her maid duty right away by cleaning up their dressing room. The stipulation expired on July 6, 2010. On August 14, 2010 at Verano de Escandalo Blake teamed up with Alan Stone, Mini Abismo Negro and Yuriko in a losing effort against Cynthia Moreno, El Elegido, Octagoncito and Pimpinela Escarlata in a Relevos At√≥micos de locura match. On March 13, 2011, Blake and her La Sociedad stablemate Alan Stone defeated Faby Apache and Pimpinela Escarlata to win the AAA World Mixed Tag Team Championship. In June Blake began accompanying the members of La Maniarqu√≠a to counteract Nanyzh Rock, the valet of their rival Heavy Metal. On July 31 at Verano de Esc√°ndalo, Blake received her first shot at the AAA Reina de Reinas Championship in an eight-way elimination match, but was unable to win the title. After a seven month long hiatus from AAA, Blake returned to the promotion on July 27, 2012, when she teamed with Mari Apache in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Faby Apache and Lolita. On October 7 at H√©roes Inmortales, Blake and Stone lost the AAA World Mixed Tag Team Championship to Halloween and Mari Apache in a four-way match, which also included the teams of Atomic Boy and Faby Apache, and F√©nix and Lolita. On November 27, Blake made her Japanese debut, when she took part in the 2012 Reina de Reinas tournament co-produced by AAA and Pro Wrestling Wave in Tokyo's Korakuen Hall. Blake was eliminated from the tournament in her opening match by Sexy Star. On February 3, 2013, Blake turned technica for the first time in AAA, when she was attacked after a match by Mari Apache and Taya, before being saved by Faby Apache, La Jarochita and Lolita. On March 1, Blake lost to her rival Taya in the first round of a tournament for the vacant AAA Reina de Reinas Championship, after interference from Mari Apache, Sexy Lady and Lufisto.

While the gates were once opened only for the king, today they are always closed, and so the gates have in a way become a sacred space themselves, representative of the actual sacred space behind them. Many travellers and locals come to pray at the gates. The stone gate was first built in 1519, during the reign of Ryukyuan king Sh≈ç Shin, though the space had been recognized as a sacred utaki prior to that. Whenever the king left the castle on a journey, he would first stop at Sonohyan-utaki to pray for safe travels. The site also played an important role in the initiation of the of the native religion. The gate is said to be a prime example of traditional Okinawan architecture, and shows many signs of Chinese influence, along with a Japanese-influenced gable in the karahafu style. It was severely damaged in the 1945 battle of Okinawa, but was restored in 1957, and officially designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000, along with a number of other sites across Okinawa Island. The utaki, i.e. the sacred grove itself, was once much larger than it is today, an elementary school and other buildings having encroached upon the space.

It was built between 1606 and 1618 as the pantheon of the Polish commander Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski and his family. Description The interior The building's design is attributed to a team of Italian Mannerist architects active in Lviv in the early 17th century. Started by , continued by , and (Ambrosius Simonis, an Italian from EngadinJan Bialostocki. At the Crossroads of Classicism and Byzantinism: Leopolitan Architectural Achievements ca. A.D. 1600. Harvard Ukrainian Studies. Vol. VII. 1983. p. 52.). The building is raised on a terrace constructed by the Turkish captives. The hexagonal bell tower, originally part of Zhovkva's fortifications, leans somewhat to the east. The frieze and some parts of the interior recall martial events. Especially notable are two statues attributed to Andreas Schl√ºter. The dome is heavily coffered. In the 17th century, the walls of the church were decorated with pictorial representations of Zolkiewski's and Sobieski's battles executed by Szymon Boguszowicz and Martin Altamonte, among others. They have since been moved to Olesko Castle. Apart from the Zolkiewsky, the church contains the family vaults of their relatives such as the Danilowiczy and the Sobiesky, notably Jakub Sobieski, John III's father. The church is often viewed as a shrine to the golden age of Polish military achievement; so much so that its ongoing restoration has been sponsored by the Warsaw University of Technology and the Polish military.

History Cuddesdon Palace was completed by 1634 for John Bancroft, who was Bishop of Oxford from 1632 until 1641. In 1644 during the English Civil War Royalist forces burned the palace to render it unusable by the Parliamentarian forces besieging Oxford. In 1676 John Fell was made Bishop of Oxford and in 1679 he commissioned the complete rebuilding of the palace.Cole, J. C. The building of the second palace at Cuddesdon . Oxoniensia, Volume 24, pages 49‚Äì69, 1960. Oxford Architectural and Historical Society. . In 1846 Bishop Samuel Wilberforce had the chapel of Saints Peter and Paul added to the Palace. It was designed by the Gothic Revival architect Benjamin Ferrey. Successive Bishops of Oxford resided at the palace until Thomas Banks Strong retired in 1937. For the duration of the Second World War Queen Anne's Bounty was evacuated from London and occupied the palace. Thereafter, The Society of the Salutation of Mary the Virgin occupied the palace from 1946 until 1949. In the 1960s the palace was in private use for a few years, but it burnt down before the end of that decade. The bishop's chapel escaped the fire and survives today. Ripon College Cuddesdon is in the grounds of the palace, which is now a private residence. The Bishop of Oxford now resides in North Oxford.

The film investigates issues of gender, class and sexuality in the Arab world through the lives of two generations of women at a prince's palace. Seen through the eyes of an attractive young wedding singer, it exposes the sexual and social servitude of a group of women in an elaborate palace during the French Protectorate in Tunisia. Tlatli wrote the film in response to her own mother's sudden severe illness and her subsequent realization of how little she knew about her life.  Plot  Set in 1950s Tunisia, the film is about a 25-year-old woman, Alia, who returns to her place of birth‚Äîa prince's palace in which her mother, Khedija, worked as a house servant and mistress. Alia had fled the palace ten years earlier, at which time she spent burying tortured memories of her childhood. In her visit to pay respects for the death of the prince, Alia wanders through the largely abandoned palace where she is confronted by these memories represented as detailed flashbacks of her childhood. She begins to piece together a narrative about her mother's sexuality and sexual exploitation in a space ordered by gender and class difference, and is re-awakened to her persistent questioning about her father's identity. As Alia negotiates her past, she also deals with her current relationship to her lover, Lotfi, who has asked her to have what seems to be yet another abortion. Her development throughout the film contrasts her awakening to a past of sexual and social servitude which many of the female servants experienced in the palace against her own contested independence fraught with pain, conflict and uncertainty.  Critical reception  The film received positive attention at the New York Film Festival in 1994; New York Times critic Caryn James describes the film as a \\"universal coming-of-age story with a feminist twist.\\" After wider release in 1996, the L.A. Times drew attention to Tlati's depiction of feminist issues in Tunisia and praised her \\"flowing, sensual style,\\" calling the film \\"brutal\\" and \\"tender.\\" Paul Sedra's 2011 article describes the continued relevance of Silences of the Palace in Arabic studies.

The band started on the grounds of previous metal band, Archeon, which Micha≈Ç \\"Mike\\" Kostrzy≈Ñski and Tomek Grochowski had created. Made Of Hate is well known in Poland for their stage appearances with Iron Maiden, Mot√∂rhead and Arch Enemy. Biography Made of Hate was created in early 2007. Band members had known each other from their previous metal act called Archeon. Before the Made Of Hate era, musicians played countless shows across Poland and got a pretty decent recognition. Yet, the decision was made to leave the old flag and have a brand new start with a fresh and revised music. Micha≈Ç Kostrzy≈Ñski, as a composer and songwriter to both Archeon and Made Of Hate, decided to leave keyboards behind and focus more on guitar work that he had become known for. After the decision was made, brand new band - Made Of Hate, headed to the Zed Studio to record their first album entitled Bullet In Yout Head. Band promptly recorded the album and started to look for a partner to release their music. It didn't last long, since they got a call from AFM Records. The label signed the band and from now on Made Of Hate became a newcomer with album ready to be released. The release of the band, which took place in February 2008, was a success to both band and label. Made Of Hate started to appear on the news, radio and music television around the world and quite fast they got very warm welcome from metal world. In fact, album received very good reviews from which one had a little more than a great impact. Made Of Hate was handpicked by Iron Maiden and Bruce Dickinson for his radio show at BBC. Dickinson played their music several times over few weeks and band rapidly got new fans all around the world. Made Of Hate got recognition and became known for Kostrzy≈Ñski's shredding, his exquisite guitar lines and solos combined with heavy riffs and pounding drum lines. The promotion of band in 2008 was splendid and the cherry on the top was an event that took place in Summer 2008. Made Of Hate was again handpicked to direct support Iron Maiden on their show in Warsaw, Poland. Band played their first show as Made Of Hate on the Gwardia Stadium for 30 000 fans just before Iron Maiden. The show was great and fans loved Made Of Hate. There was also a little incident on the stage. Mike's amplifier had blown on stage during one of songs. Fortunately, band bounced back and finished the show playing one more songs. The audience went crazy leaving the band with the warmest welcome and cheer. In 2009 band decided to focus on working on the new album. Made Of Hate decided to mix things a little by changing the lead vocals from Mike's to Radek's. Also, Mike took all the guitar parts and Radek left the rhythm guitar station to fully focus on vocals. That change was also made due to Mike's torn vocals as he couldn't handle screaming higher parts of the vocal lines. Additionally, he claimed that \\"playing guitar and giving the best out of it is the actual reason why I picked the guitar at first place. Now I can focus on guitar lines, play more complex and be the axeman I wanted\\". The recordings for the new album took place again at ZED Studio. The new album entitled Pathogen was released in 2010. Again, band appeared on several radio stations, magazines and TV stations, including the biggest TV station in Poland. Album was received well by the audience and band started to plan shows for upcoming year. Few clips on band's official YouTube channel appeared teasing with the album riffs and gear explanation. Again, Made Of Hate's style was described as a talent show for Mike's guitar skills. In 2011 Made Of Hate started with the high note by being part of Sonisphere Festival. Again, they played with Iron Maiden and Mot√∂rhead and Mastodon to name a few. This time the show took place on the airfield and the audience was even bigger than before at the stadium. Along with that big show, band played few festivals across Poland, f.e. Seven Festival. Also, this year band released their first official video clip to song called Lock'n'load. In 2012 Made Of Hate continued to play concerts all over the Poland. While the band was on the hype with the shows and with getting more and more fans on their concerts, Jarek decided to leave the band and leave music for good. The band, as devastated as motivated, decided to not slow things down and focused on finding new bass player. It didn't take any time at all as Made Of Hate offered a job to Marlena Rutkowska. They had known her from her amateur band next door at the rehearsal complex, and decided to give her a chance to fill in after Jarek. In late 2012 and early 2013 band camped at HZ Studio, near Warsaw. The reason of that was simple - a new album. The recording session was quick and after that a long period of mixing and mastering took place. In the meantime band toured Poland with a new bassist on their squad. Marelna got attention on stage and band finished the year with a successful tour, recorded and almost ready to go album and plans for the new year. In 2014 Made Of Hate ended their relationship with AFM Records and signed with Fonografika. In April 2014 band released their 3rd album entitled Out Of Hate. Heaviest than ever, new album received great feedback again. On July 13, Made Of Hate shared stage with Arch Enemy.

It was founded in 1983 by Abbey Meyers, along with individuals and rare diseases leaders of rare disease support groups, and it is a 501(c)3 tax exempt organization. History The organization grew out of an \\"informal coalition\\" of support groups and families called together in the late 1970s to advocate legislation supporting development of orphan drugs, or drugs for treating rare diseases. They succeeded in getting the United States Congress to pass the Orphan Drug Act (ODA) in early 1983. The initial coalition was led by Abbey Meyers, whose son had Tourette syndrome. Tourette syndrome was estimated by the National Institutes of Health to affect 100,000 people in the United States. Meyers' son was helped by an experimental drug that the manufacturer ceased to develop because they assumed it would not be profitable enough. After passage of the Orphan Drug Act, the coalition founded NORD with Meyers as its president. In 2007 Meyers announced her retirement from the NORD presidency; the president is now Peter Saltonstall. Since its founding in 1983, NORD continued to grow with the help of federal grants and donations. Scope NORD's operations include funding research on treatment and cures for rare diseases; lobbying for legislation to benefit the rare diseases community (in addition to the Orphan Drug Act, NORD has helped bring about legislation on publicizing clinical trials on the Internet, to give the public and medical professionals warning about projected drug shortages, and on the development of medical devices); spreading information about rare diseases; and helping individuals with rare diseases afford medication and treatment. In February 2009, NORD sponsored Rare Disease Day in the United States; this was the first time Rare Disease Day was observed in the United States (it was first observed in Europe in February 2008). NORD has also helped other countries to develop orphan drug legislation in their nations.

These functions and their properties are easily generalizable to include additional factors of production (like land, natural resources, entrepreneurship, etc.) Technology There are three common ways to incorporate technology (or the efficiency with which factors of production are used) into a production function (here A is a scale factor, F is a production function, and Y is the amount of physical output produced): * Hicks-neutral technology, or \\"factor augmenting\\": \\\\ Y = AF(K,L) * Harrod-neutral technology, or \\"labor augmenting\\": \\\\ Y = F(K,AL) * Solow-neutral technology, or \\"capital augmenting\\": \\\\ Y = F(AK,L) Elasticity of substitution The elasticity of substitution between factors of production is a measure of how easily one factor can be substituted for another. With two factors of production, say, K and L, it is a measure of the curvature of a production isoquant. The mathematical definition is: :\\\\ \\\\epsilon=\\\\left[\\\\frac {\\\\partial(slope)} {\\\\partial(L/K)} \\\\frac {L/K} {slope}\\\\right]^{-1} where \\"slope\\" denotes the slope of the isoquant, given by :\\\\ slope=-\\\\frac {\\\\partial F(K,L)/ \\\\partial K} {\\\\partial F(K,L)/ \\\\partial L}. Returns to scale Returns to scale can be * Increasing returns to scale: doubling all input usages more than doubles output. * Decreasing returns to scale: doubling all input usages less than doubles output. * Constant returns to scale: doubling all input usages exactly doubles output.

Its first project was to establish an environmental centre at Bridge 5 Mill, in East Manchester, hence the name. MERCi promote social, environmental and economic sustainability for the city of Manchester. The Charity‚Äôs strapline is: \\"Ideas into Action for a Sustainable Future\\". According to their website, MERCI's aim is to work towards a future that is greener, safer, healthier and more equitable. MERCi (pronounced 'murky') was established by a group of campaigners who were \\"frustrated by the lack of support, positive vision and available resources to make Manchester a more sustainable city\\".  History  Four individuals: Chris Walsh, Helen Woodcock, Cath Miller and Jane Pickering established MERCi over five years beginning in 1996 culminating in the centre's official launch on 25 April 2001. The group raised over three million pounds and project managed the refurbishment of the mill utilising funding from the National Lottery, Esm√©e Fairbairn Foundation, The Tudor Trust and European Regional Development Fund. The Mill was refurbished with the support of volunteers and trainees and is one of Manchester's most environmentally friendly buildings. Manchester Civic Society acknowledged this in 2001 when Bridge 5 Mill won the award of Manchester's most energy efficient building. A green roof was added in 2008 to encourage wildlife to the building.  Activities  Bridge 5 Mill Bridge 5 Mill was Manchester's first Centre for Change, a converted five story mill on the border of Beswick and Ancoats on the Ashton Canal, it was named after the fifth bridge on the canal: bridge number 5. It became \\"a focal point for debate and sustainability\\" It is home to a range of charities, campaign groups and green businesses. The centre provides community resources including conference and meeting rooms, a library, equipment hire and offices for voluntary groups and social enterprises. Environment Network for Manchester The Environment Network for Manchester (EN4M) was established by MERCi and is based at Bridge 5 Mill. It is a membership organisation made up of groups and organisations which share MERCi's aim of improving the environment of Manchester, towards the development of a truly sustainable city. Herbie Herbie is a mobile greengrocer set up by MERCi in 2004 to provide affordable, fresh fruit and vegetables to residents living in areas of East Manchester with poor access to fresh foods. Customers can walk on board and they also supply boxes of fruit to schools and community projects, working with sheltered housing, churches, health clinics and resident groups.  Mission statement  According to their website, MERCi‚Äôs mission statement is: * MERCi believes that the most effective way to involve people in a vision for a sustainable Manchester is to establish a Centre for Sustainable Living in the heart of the city. * MERCi will therefore strive to create a Centre that provides support, stability and advice to organisations and individuals that share this vision of sustainable living and will seek to advance public sustainability issues. * MERCi will ensure that the Centre for Sustainable Living is a working demonstration of eco-design, refurbishment best practice and sustainable living in an urban environment. * MERCi believes in a local and fair sustainable economy. It will, therefore, promote and provide support for community-based initiatives that create socially and ecologically worthwhile secure employment for local people.

The majority of Irish people claim to be Roman Catholic, and indicate this on the census form. However, views on actual church dogma both on social and spiritual matters varies significantly, and weekly mass attendance is below 40%. The Holy See has an Apostolic Nunciature in Dublin. Relations were strained in the 2000s after revelations of sex abuse cases in the Catholic Church in Ireland. History Ancient links Embassy of Ireland to the Holy See, Rome Ireland has had links with the Holy See since at least the time of Saint Patrick. Patrick was sent to Ireland by Pope Celestine I. Relations between Ireland and the Holy See continued through the appointment of bishops, and papal legates were sent to preside over reforming synods, such as the Synod of Kells in 1152. The Synod of Cashel (1172) continued this process after the Norman conquest. The Pontifical Irish College, the Roman Catholic seminary for the training and education of priests in Rome, was founded in 1628. Irish Catholics were the main promoters of Catholic emancipation that was achieved in 1829 in what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. From 1850 the Irish Church followed Ultramontanism under Cardinal Cullen and it became a conservative element in the Irish nationalist movement. Irish Republic During the Irish War of Independence (1919‚Äì21) the Irish Republic hoped for recognition from the Holy See, which was not forthcoming. A memorandum from envoy Sean T O'Kelly to Pope Benedict XV in May 1920 made the case for Vatican recognition of the Republic. The United Kingdom envoy at that time was the count de Salis, a Catholic landowner in County Limerick who was not a supporter of Irish nationalism. The Holy See withheld recognition until the war had ended with a treaty signed at the end of 1921 between the proposed Irish Free State and Britain, that allowed for international recognition of the new Irish state. Irish Free State During the 1922-23 Irish Civil War Irish prime minister W. T. Cosgrave asked the Holy See to recall its peace envoy, Monsignor Luzio, from \\"blundering around Ireland\\" and deplored that Luzio had met \\"with some of the persons in armed revolt against this Government and indeed against the social and moral order.\\"No. 65 NAI DFA Secretaries' Files S2; Cosgrave to Gasperri, 19 April 1923 Online version His Minister for Foreign Affairs Desmond FitzGerald was sent to the Holy See to put forward the government's point of view and its opinion of Monsignor Luzio. In turn when Luzio returned to the Holy See he was reported to have said that when he came to Ireland to meet the 26 bishops in the country, he had instead \\"found 26 Popes\\". This was in part because the commencement of diplomatic relations after Ireland's War of Independence most Irish bishops felt that a nunciature would reduce their authority. Following the 1929 Lateran Treaty between the Kingdom of Italy and the Holy See, other states including the Irish Free State exchanged envoys with the Holy See for the first time. Fianna F√°il deplored that the government had failed to consult the bishops about the diplomatic exchange. √âamon de Valera ‚Äì together with many other senior clergymen ‚Äì believed that the Holy See was pro-British and, therefore, opposed diplomatic relations with the Holy See. However, the first Nuncio, Paschal Robinson, who was appointed in January 1930, proved to be a popular choice with both the church and the state. Joseph Walshe became the first Irish ambassador to the Holy See in 1946. At the time, Giovanni Battista Montini, the future Pope Paul VI, told him that \\"you are the most Catholic country in the world.\\" Walshe said that he believed Ireland's relationship with the Holy See was of \\"a very special character.\\" The relationship was cemented by the 1932 Eucharistic Congress in Dublin, and Irish diplomatic protocol treated the Papal Nuncio ex officio as the \\"Dean\\", or honorary senior member, of the diplomatic corps. In 1948 the Irish Free State became the Republic of Ireland. In 1951 the influence of the Church was so high that the then Taoiseach, John A. Costello, said that: \\"I am an Irishman second, I am a Catholic first, and I accept without qualification in all respects the teaching of the hierarchy and the church to which I belong.\\" During the 1970s the Holy See watched with concern developments in Northern Ireland, and on 19 December 1974, Pope Paul VI expressed his hope to the Irish Ambassador to the Vatican for a peaceful solution in that area, but without expressing any opinion as to whether it should be part of the Republic of Ireland or the United Kingdom. At a luncheon in Iveagh House in September 1985, Minister for Foreign Affairs Peter Barry told Cardinal Secretary of State Agostino Casaroli that the relationship between church and state in Ireland hurt the two major parties. However, he said that bishops in Ireland had a right to put forward their positions, but the Irish state would legislate for the common good. Between 1973‚Äì1977, Liam Cosgrave's (son of W. T. Cosgrave) government had a rift with the Holy See over the actions of Nuncio Archbishop Gaetano Alibrandi in relation to Northern Ireland in which Cosgrave wrote a letter to the Holy See, and approved by Garret FitzGerald, which was read by Alibrandi as the \\"closest thing to a declaration of war.\\" FitzGerald even asked for Alibrandi to be declared persona non-grata but Cosgrave would not agree to the proposal In September 1979 Pope John Paul II made the first papal visit to Ireland. 39 years later, Pope Francis visited Ireland for the World Meeting of Families held in Dublin in 2018. Held every three years, the meeting is the world's largest Catholic gathering of families.Pope Francis may visit Ireland for world meeting in Dublin The Irish Times, 27 September 2015 Challenges =Child abuse= The 2009 Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was one of a range of measures introduced by the Irish Government to investigate the extent and effects of the Catholic sexual abuse scandal in Ireland. Following an electoral victory, the Fine Gael government led by Enda Kenny took stronger steps against the church in Ireland. Speaking to the D√°il following the release of the Cloyne Report, which showed that Irish clerics partook in a cover-up to conceal the extent of child sexual abuse after the Vatican questioned the child protection guidelines adopted by the Irish bishops, he said that \\"the historic relationship between church and state in Ireland could not be the same again. The rape and torture of children were downplayed or 'managed' to uphold instead the primacy of the institution, its power, standing and reputation.\\" Mr Kenny said the Cloyne Report \\"exposed the dysfunction, disconnection, elitism and narcissism\\" in the Vatican.\\"Ireland accredits new envoy to the Vatican RT√â News, 11 November 2014 On 25 July 2011 the Apostolic Nuncio Archbishop Leanza was recalled to the Secretariat of State of the Holy See \\"for consultations\\" as a sign, among other things, of \\"surprise and disappointment at certain excessive reactions\\". Some confidential communications written by an American diplomat assigned to the Vatican were published as part of WikiLeaks, and revealed difficulties in the relationship between the Holy See and the Republic of Ireland during the investigation of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.WikiLeaks: Vatican Pressured Ireland On Sex Abuse Scandal The Huffington Post, 10 February 2011 When Ireland later closed its embassy to the Holy See, \\"the move was interpreted in Vatican diplomatic circles as a snub by Ireland\\" in response to its perception that the Holy See was trying to cover up and interfere in a report on clerical child abuse. =Same sex marriage= The Irish Marriage Equality referendum was held on 22 May 2015, and the measure passed easily in spite of opposition from the Holy See. With votes from all 43 constituencies counted, the 62.07% \\"yes\\" vote assured the passage of the referendum. The Vatican reaction to the news of Ireland's enthusiastic embrace of marriage equality was quick and negative. Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state, called the measure's passage a \\"defeat for humanity\\".Vatican says Ireland gay marriage vote is 'defeat for humanity' The Guardian, 26 May 2015 Non-residential status of ambassador and reopening On 3 November 2011 the Irish T√°niste and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Eamon Gilmore announced that Ireland would close its embassy in the Vatican, along with the embassy in Tehran and a representative office in East-Timor, and that the Irish ambassador to the Holy See would reside not in Rome but in Ireland. Gilmore said the \\"decision follows a review of overseas missions carried out by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which gave particular attention to the economic return from bilateral missions\\". \\"In order to meet its targets under the EU-IMF programme and to restore public expenditure to sustainable levels, the Government has been obliged to implement cuts across a wide range of public services. No area of Government expenditure can be immune from the need to implement savings.\\" The decision was highly controversial and opposed by former diplomats including retired ambassador Se√°n Donlon. The argument that it could not be justified on financial grounds was also questioned. Some believe it is more related to Ireland's reaction to Vatican handling of sexual abuse cases in Ireland. Shortly after the release of the Cloyne report on Church handling of abuse and shortly before the closure of the Embassy, Enda Kenny criticised the Vatican's approach to the sex abuse crisis in the D√°il: \\"Far from listening to evidence of humiliation and betrayal with St Benedict‚Äôs 'ear of the heart'... the Vatican‚Äôs reaction was to parse and analyse it with the gimlet eye of a canon lawyer\\".New ambassador to the Holy See appointed The Irish Times, 6 May 2014 The Minister was questioned several times in the D√°il about the status of Ireland's representation to the Holy See. On 17 April 2013, he replied \\"The Government decision in November 2011 to close our resident embassy to the Holy See was taken with considerable reluctance as part of a necessary budget process to reduce costs. The closure of the resident embassy to the Holy See has yielded substantial savings, not least as it enabled the significantly larger embassy to Italy and the residence of the ambassador to Italy to be relocated to the State-owned Villa Spada, formerly occupied by the embassy to the Holy See, thereby saving ‚Ç¨445,000 per annum in rent on two properties. Ambassador Cooney travels to Rome regularly and was present for the inauguration of Pope Francis, to which he accompanied the President and the Minister for Finance who represented the Government and subsequently at the Pope‚Äôs meeting with the Diplomatic Corps. I am satisfied that the current arrangement for Ireland‚Äôs representation at the Holy See is the most effective possible in light of the resource constraints faced by my Department. The resident embassy to the Holy See will not be reopened in the immediate term. I will, however, be keeping the deployment of our diplomatic and consular resources under review in light of ongoing national priorities and the availability of resources.\\" In January 2014 it was announced that a residential ambassador would be reappointed. One senior Vatican figure said the reopening will mark \\"the end of a painful period\\" in Ireland's relations with the Holy See. The reopening of the Embassy was announced by Eamon Gilmore as part of an expansion of Ireland's diplomatic network which will see Embassies opening in Thailand, Indonesia, Croatia, Kenya and the Holy See. Officials also stressed that there would be no possibility of the Embassy being housed at its old site of Villa Spada which, in the meantime, has become the Irish Embassy to Italy. The Ministry claims the new Vatican Embassy will be a \\"modest\\", one-person operation. Archbishop Charles John Brown said: \\"It is an excellent decision for the people of Ireland and will be beneficial to Ireland in making its distinctive and important contribution to international relations. We are all grateful to those who worked so hard to make this day possible\\". On 11 November 2014, the then‚Äìnewly appointed Irish Ambassador to the Holy See, Emma Madigan presented her Letters of Credence to Pope Francis. It was reported that the Holy See was anxious to welcome her as a sign of thawing relations. Madigan's predecessor, David Cooney, had to wait several months before meeting Pope Benedict XVI.Early Papal Welcome for new Irish Vatican ambassador The Irish Catholic, 4 September 2014 Pope Francis's visit to Ireland Pope Francis visited Ireland on 25 and 26 August 2018, as part of the World Meeting of Families 2018.

During his life, he published four volumes of poetry and two volumes of fiction. Reece wrote the words of his legacy in four lines: :From chips and shards, in idle times, :I made these stories, shaped these rhymes; :May they engage some friendly tongue :When I am past the reach of song.'' : :  Life  Born in Union County, Georgia on September 14, 1917, Reece began publishing poems locally while in high school, receiving his first widespread publication in 1943 with the publication of \\"Lest the Lonesome Bird\\" in the Prairie Schooner journal. Ballad of the Bones and Other Poems, collecting Reece's poetry, soon followed, in 1945. He published Bow Down in Jericho, his 1950 follow-up to that first, critically acclaimed publication. That same year, Reece published Better a Dinner of Herbs, his first novel. In 1952, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for fiction.Byron Herbert Reece, John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. Retrieved on 2009-02-14. 1952 also saw a third volume of poetry, A Song of Joy, while 1955 brought his second novel, The Hawk and the Sun and his final volume of poetry, The Season of Flesh. On June 3, 1958, Reece committed suicide at the age of forty, responding to illness and depression. During his final years, Reece also taught classes at Young Harris College to earn extra money. He was found in his office, with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart playing on the record player and his final set of student papers graded and neatly stacked in the desk drawer.2007 Georgia Literary Festival Union Sentinel. September 13, 2007. Retrieved on 2009-02-14.  Personality  In a career cut short by illness and suicide, Byron Herbert Reece produced an enduring body of poetry and fiction from the sounds and spirits of his North Georgia homeland. His five volumes of verse draw deeply from the lyrical wellsprings of Nature and the Bible, twin legacies of an upbringing in the agricultural uplands of Union County, around Blairsville. His two novels, in turn, are remarkable regional portraits - one a mountain family drama of overland journey to Old Testament rhythms, the other a morality play of a small-town lynching. Reece was a bright and solitary schoolboy, a graduate of Blairsville High School who grew up in such rural isolation, the story goes, that he never saw a car until he was eight or twelve (depending on the version). He attended Young Harris College and taught school intermittently between 1935 and 1942, producing poem after poem for small journals and newspapers even while his parents‚Äô tuberculoses led him to take increasing responsibility for the family farm. During these years, Atlanta Constitution editor Ralph McGill and Kentucky writer Jesse Stuart - themselves offspring of the rural Appalachians - early recognized Reece‚Äôs talent. He won American Poet magazine‚Äôs annual poetry award in 1943, and with Stuart‚Äôs sponsorship H.P. Dutton published Reece‚Äôs first volume of poetry, Ballad of the Bones, in 1945. By 1952, Reece had been profiled in a national magazine (Newsweek), and tendered a position as poet-in-residence at UCLA. In the short decade of success Reece saw before illness, financial insecurity, and loss took their ultimate toll on him, he was much honored in his home state. Five times he received the Georgia Writers Association‚Äôs literary achievement award, and he served as poet-in-residence at both Young Harris College and Emory University. His books and honors never yielded much in money, however, and Reece‚Äôs labors never long allayed the financial worries that attended the harsh circumstances of the farm and family illness. He was teaching part-time at Young Harris to make ends meet, in fact, when depression and illness wore him down and Reece took his own life on June 3, 1958, three months shy of his forty-first birthday.  Honors and Legacy  Reece received Guggenheim Fellowships for fiction in 1952 and 1957. The Georgia Writers Hall of Fame inducted Reece in 2001. In 2003 a group of writers formed the Byron Herbert Reece Society to preserve and promote Reece's legacy. In 2004, the Society began working on constructing a museum to the writer on the site of his family farm, which is owned by Union County, and the museum and grounds are now open to visitors. The Byron Herbert Reece Farm and Heritage Center in Blairsville, Georgia tells the story of Reece's life, and shows Appalachian farming techniques from the early 20th century. Features of the farm include a Poetry Trail Garden, Mulberry Hall (the poet's writing studio), and five barn buildings housing 13 exhibits. Reece's life story is at the center of Georgia's state drama, The Reach of Song, which depicts life between World War I and World War II in the Appalachian Mountains. The Byron Herbert Reece Society petitioned the Georgia General Assembly to name Reece ‚ÄúGeorgia‚Äôs Appalachian Poet/Novelist\\" and to designate Highway 129 from Blairsville to Neels Gap \\"The Byron Herbert Reece Memorial Highway.‚Äù This was accomplished through the Georgia General Assembly's HR 295 which was passed in 2005.

From its origin as a small stronghold built by the ancient Illyrian tribe Dalmatae, it developed into a fortress in the 15th century, during the reign of Bosnian feudal lord Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá Hrvatiniƒá.  Location  Prozor Fortress sits prominently above the town of Vrlika. It was chain link of near by forts like fort Glava≈° - Dinariƒá and Potravnik. The closest large towns are Sinj, Knin, and Drni≈°. Prozor Fortress also has views of the Peruƒáa Lake (Peruƒáko jezero) and mountains Dinara and Kame≈°nica to the east and mountain Svilaja to the southwest. Prozor Fortress is made of stone like other fortresses in Dalmatia. It is partially restored, and entrance is free of charge. The way up to Prozor Fortress starts at the Roman Catholic parish church in Vrlika. It takes a car ride towards small village of Maovice, followed by a 25-minute walk along a dirt trail.  History  Prozor Fortress above the town of Vrlika Prior to the arrival of the South Slavs, the Dalmatae are said to have lived in the region. The known history of Prozor Fortress begins parallel with the history of Vrlika in the 7th century, when the Croats moved there and formed a village on the spring of the river Cetina, in a field below the mountain Dinara. In the 9th century probably during the time of Duke Branimir of Littoral Croatian Duchy, the old Croatian Catholic St. Saviour () was built near Vrlika, then called Vrh Rike.http://public.carnet.hr/zuh/do1874/srv/srv_2.htm#1 After the crowning of Ladislaus as the Hungarian King in Zadar in 1403, and in political maneuvering against his arch political rival and enemy, king Sigismund, he appointed Hrvatiniƒá as his deputy for Croatia and Dalmatia as he promised earlier. In 1406, king Ladislaus of Naples gifted Prozor Fortress, at that time Castrum Werhlychky, as a center of Vrliƒçka ≈æupa to the Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá.https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/TheTropics/4689/history.htm&date;=2009-10-25+11:18:52 Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá Hrvatiniƒá expanded Prozor fortress. Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá Hrvatiniƒá was most powerful Bosnian nobleman and magnate of his time, and carried a title of \\"Grand Duke of Bosnia, Knyaz of Donji Kraji, and Duke of Split\\" (later Herzog of Split), and now he was made by Ladislaus his \\"deputy for this Dalmatian territory, calling him his Vicar General for the regions of Slavonia (in partibus Sclavonie)\\". He was the most prominent member of House of Hrvatiniƒá, one of the most important of three feudal families in medieval Bosnia at the time, beside royal dynasty. At the beginning of the 15th century, Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá fortified and strengthen the Prozor Fortress over the Vrlika valley to defend inhabitants from the invasion by the Ottoman Empire.Soldo (2001), p. 21. After 1416, and Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá death, his son Bal≈°a Hercegoviƒá was unable to hold Prozor Fortress, which then passed to Ivani≈° Nelipiƒá, and later to Ivan Frankopan. In 1421, king Sigismund donated Vrlika with the Prozor Fortress to Mihaƒça Nikolin Vitturi, but Ivani≈° Nelipiƒá refused to handover the fortress. When wealthy Prince Ivani≈° Nelipiƒá, the last male member of Frankopan's illustrious clan, died in 1434, the problem of inheritance became acute. According to his will, his only daughter, Princess Catherine or Margarita Nelipiƒá, was to inherit all of his extensive possessions from the Velebit ranges to Cetina river. Her patrimony was argued and eventually shared by Frankopan. In spite of the legality of this bequest, and his consent to the marriage upon request of the late Ivani≈° Nelipiƒá, king Sigismund denounced the testament and demanded that Frankopan turn over to him the legacy of his wife's inheritance. When Frankopan refused to obey, Sigismund proclaimed him a rebel and deprived him of all honors and possessions. After that the fortress was lost to Venetian noble Mihaƒça (Mikac) Nikolin Vitturi from Trogir, who was a commissioner of king Sigismund. The Turks invaded the fortress in 1522, and held it until 1688. After the fortress was taken, the Turks, disregarding the conditions of its surrender, massacred all within it. After the Turks, the fortress belonged to the Republic of Venice, then to the Austrian Empire, when it lost its main strategic importance. From 1805 to 1813, it was under French rule, and from 1813 to 1918 it again under the Austrian rule, as was all Croatia.  Architecture  Layout of Prozor Fortress Prozor Fortress was built on isolated rock, detached from the craggy cliff on the end of mountain Svilaja range of hills.Wilkinson (1848), p. 227. The remains of the Prozor Fortress are the ruins of a spacious residential building, a water tank, stone walls and a chapel. The Prozor Fortress was expended while it was owned by Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá Hrvatiniƒá at the end of 14th and early 15th centuries from the small stronghold built by the Illyrian tribe of Dalmatae. In Turkish times the mahala, or the housing area of Vrlika fortress, developed around it. Prozor Fortress is dominated by the tall keep or donjon, around which is an open court with houses and a chapel. The courtyard is defended by the lower ramparts and a round tower. A drawbridge once gave access to the keep. Today's condition of Prozor Fortress is poorly, as the fortress is ruined, although slightly renovated.

Since then, the 3H Movement has been arguing against illiberal ideologies such as socialism, conservatism, fascism, and nationalism in Turkey. The movement has a daily-updated website where the members publish their articles on various economic and political issues with a liberal viewpoint. Current president of executive board of the organization is B√ºnyamin. The 3H Manifesto * The current constitution of Turkey is a product of the 80's coup d'√©tat. Turkey must adopt a liberal constitution. * The government of Turkey must under all circumstances obey the rule of law. * Turkey is a country with a diverse population. The government must tolerate diversity (e.g. ethnical, cultural, social and sexual) within the country. * Turkey needs an effective free market economy. The current statist approach, bureaucracy and high taxes hinder the free market. These three obstacles must be abolished. * Liberty is the premiere of human rights. It must be protected by law and shall be approached by tolerance. * The economy can not be governed or guided. * Religious preferences or sexual orientations of individuals must be respected. * Individuals must in all circumstances have a freedom to associate with particular respect to their personal beliefs and ideas, and thus spread them. * State authorities shall not assume a privilege of having a say about the personal lives of individuals. * Public institutions shall be privatized according to efficiency and productivity criteria. * Individual liberties can only be restricted by the liberties of others. * The education of children must belong to their parents. * Neither private nor public, any institution shall be exempt from judicial review. * For justice in tax distribution, progressive and increasingly high income taxes shall be removed. * Only defensive wars can be legitimized. * All victimless crime and voluntary agreements shall be excluded from being a criminal offense. * The state shall not have a religion nor use religion for purposes of its own. The Projects In order to reach its target 3H Movement runs some continuous projects. The Liberal Youth Congress The movement claims that it is Turkey's only annual liberal youth gathering. The main aim of the project is to have annual gathering for the liberal youth to share ideas about the organization. In 2012 it will be held first time as an international congress. The project is funded by Friedrich Naumann Foundation, European Liberal Forum and 3H Movement. Freedom en Route This is another annual project. For two weeks the members of the organization from all over Turkey travels all regions of Turkey. Every two days they settle in another university of another city and hold conferences on another subject that 3H members from that University had chosen. Famous Liberal scholars and columnists join the trip in order to give speech at the universities. The project, proposed and funded by the Atlas Economic Research Foundation in co-sponsored by the Smith Family Foundation. Some Subjects discussed are Turkey's possible integration into the European Union, human rights protection, democracy vs. authoritarianism, taming the role of the military in Turkish politics, tolerance for minorities, especially the Kurds, and what it means to be liberal in a culture deeply influenced by socialism, nationalism, and Islam.

The airport is named after army Major Henk Fernandes, who perished in a helicopter crash in 1982. It was in fact the first aircraft of the Air Force of the young independent nation of Suriname, the Hughes 500 - Model 369D helicopter, used for patrolling missions, in March of that year, killing all five crewmembers aboard at the time (Major Henk Fernandes, second lieutenant Norman de Miranda, soldier Tjon a Kon and soldier Kowid and American pilot Foster Ford). Battalion commander Major Henk Fernandes, had previous been appointed to replace Sergeant Laurens Neede as Minister of Army and Police in 1982. However the crash occurred before the inauguration of the then new twelve ministers cabinet of Suriname under Prime Minister Henry Neijhorst. In 2018 Surinamese Minister Patrick Pengel of Public Works Transport & Communication closed the control tower of the Major H. Fernandes airport in Nickerie. The reason for this decision was the fact that the tower is currently in a very deplorable state. Although he was very impressed with the way air traffic controllers did their job despite these difficult circumstances. But it could not go on like this. In May 2019 Sanjay Ramsamoedj, chairman of the Eastern Council in the Nickerie district, pleaded for a complete rehabilitation of the Major Henry Fernandes Airport in Zeedijk.

Filmed in 1949, Puce Moment resulted from the unfinished short film Puce Women. The film opens with a camera watching 1920s-style flapper gowns being taken off a dress rack. The dresses are removed and danced off the rack to music. A long-lashed woman, Yvonne Marquis, dresses in the purple puce gown and walks to her vanity to apply perfume. She lies on a chaise longue which then begins to move around the room and eventually out to a patio. Borzois appear and she prepares to take them for a walk. Production The original soundtrack was Verdi opera music; in 1970, Anger re-released the film with a new psychedelic folk-rock soundtrack performed by Jonathan Halper. The gowns used were owned by Anger's grandmother, who had been a costume designer in the silent film era. The interior shots were filmed in the house of Sampson De Brier, a silent film actor, who later appeared in Anger's Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (1954). The exterior shots of the patio were filmed at the house of Max Rapp, who was an orchestra contractor at Universal Pictures. The house had been built by Wallace Beery in 1924 and was one of the first Hollywood Mansions in the Hollywood Dell. Anger attempts to recreate silent era style by using alternating camera speeds. Curtis Harrington was a cinematographer on the film. Yvonne Marquis, who was Anger's cousin, moved to Mexico shortly after the film was made. Anger claims Marquis was a mistress to L√°zaro C√°rdenas, the Former President of Mexico.

He also played first-class cricket for Derbyshire in 1881 and 1882. Biography Family background, early life and education Docker was born at Paxton House, Smethwick, Staffordshire, the son of Ralph Docker and his second wife, Sarah Maria (1830-1890), daughter of horse dealer Richard Sankey. His first wife was Sarah's elder sister, Mary Ann (1826-1849), with whom he had three daughters. Following some years as a widower, Ralph married Sarah, with whom he would have five sons and four daughters. Ralph Docker was a solicitor in practice at Birmingham and Smethwick who took on a large number of public appointments, including Coroner for North Worcestershire; at the time of his retirement, two days before his death in 1887, Ralph Docker was the oldest and longest-serving Coroner in England.Dudley Docker: The Life and Times of a Trade Warrior, R. P. T. Davenport-Hines, Cambridge University Press, 1984, p. 11 The Docker family's fortunes were set in motion by Thomas Docker, a Moseley brass founder; the descendants of his six sons and three daughters were established in the Midlands as professionals or gentlemen of private means. Despite Dudley Docker's own strong family loyalties, he was not given to ancestor-worship or devotion to genealogy; the notably brief pedigrees in the Burke's Landed Gentry editions of 1921 and 1937 in which he appears as head of the family of 'Docker of the Gables' contain numerous errors supplied by Docker himself- he provided erroneous information relating to the dates of his father's birth and death, his mother's death, and the name of his maternal grandfather. Docker attended King Edward's School, Birmingham but appears to have resisted formal schooling and left early. He was equally discontented when he went into his father's office to study law. In 1881 he left his father's firm and went into the varnish business with his brother William.R. P. T. Davenport-Hines Dudley Docker: The Life and Times of a Trade Warrior Cambridge University Press 2004 Cricketer In the 1881 season Docker played a first-class match for Derbyshire against Yorkshire which was drawn. He also played a match in the 1882 season against Sussex where he scored 25 in his first innings but Derbyshire lost by a few runs. From 1884 to 1886 he played a few games for Warwickshire, two games for Gentlemen of Warwick in 1887 and 1888 and one game again for Warwickshire in 1889.Frank Docker at Cricket Archive Paint and varnish In 1886 a third brother Ludford joined Docker Brothers and the death of his father in 1887 brought more capital into the firm. The varnish business grew into more general paint supply, and in 1894 the company opened a London office reflecting their success in winning orders from railway and rolling stock companies and Docker developed his interest and success in making deals. In 1902 he arranged the amalgamation of five rolling stock companies into the Metropolitan Amalgamated Carriage and Wagon Company, one of the largest business combines of the time which in 1911 employed 14,000 people and occupied of factory space.

He was a member of the Labour Party from 1900, and represented the party politically, but joined the Communist Party upon the split in 1923. Thorn√¶s was the editor-in-chief of several newspapers, most notably Ny Tid. Career Thorn√¶s hailed from Kristiansund. Having first worked a few years as a manual laborer, in 1893 he completed his typographer's education, and moved to Trondhjem. He became involved in his local trade union, and in 1900 he joined the Norwegian Labour Party. Thorn√¶s published the temperance periodical Reform in 1901, but was soon hired as a journalist in Folketidende. In 1902, he was hired in the local Labour Party organ, Ny Tid. He worked here for many years, except for the period between 1906 and 1908, when he edited a Fredrikstad newspaper, Smaalenenes Social-Demokrat. Thorn√¶s was elected to serve in Trondhjem city council in 1914, and was re-elected several times. In 1921, Thorn√¶s took over as editor-in-chief of Ny Tid. It was a turbulent time for the Labour Party, and in 1923 the party was nearing a split. In September 1923, Thorn√¶s was excluded from the party for half a year for writing about Martin Tranm√¶l that he had either \\"lost his mind\\", or was a \\"provocateur\\" and \\"class traitor\\". The party then split over disagreements of its alignment to Comintern, and the wing that supported Comintern and the Twenty-one Conditions, broke away to form the Communist Party of Norway. Thorn√¶s belonged to this wing, and as the communists usurped Ny Tid as their party organ, Thorn√¶s could continue as editor-in-chief until 1934. He also represented the Communist Party in the city council. He ran twice for Parliament, in 1930 and 1933, but was not elected. Thorn√¶s also composed songs and poems, with overtones of class struggle. His most known song is Fram kamerater ('Forward, Comrades'), which was published for the first time in Ny Tid in 1911. Thorn√¶s was also interested in church music and theater. He was a member and chairman of the board of Trondheim public library in the late 1930s. Legacy In 1955, a sculpture commemorating Thorn√¶s was erected at M√∏llenborg in Trondheim. The park in which the sculpture stands was named Thorn√¶sparken. Also, a road in Trondheim has been named after him. Thorn√¶s' daughter Signe Kristine married twice, the last time to social democratic politician and newspaper editor Ole √òisang.

The song was written by Jos√© Miguel √âvoras and Isidro Mu√±oz. It is best known as the Spanish entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1983, held in Munich. Background Musically the song is in the late 1970s - early 1980s genre 'flamenco-rock', also referred to as New Flamenco, which fused Spain's Arabic, Andalusian, Sephardic and Gypsy heritage with contemporary Anglosaxon pop and rock instrumentation, in this case from 1980s synthpop; with the exception of bass and electric guitar the studio recording of \\"¬øQui√©n maneja mi barca?\\" has a soundscape predominantly made up of drum machines, synthesizers and vocoders. When performed live at Eurovision in Munich these were however replaced by live drums, brass and woodwind. Lyrically the song mirrors the music's dramatic nature, focussing on emotions of love, passion and jealousy by posing a series of metaphorical questions. The central theme is: \\"Who sails my boat? It's drifting me away. Tell me, who sails my boat?\\" and in the verses: \\"Your mother's braids, tell me, who braids them?\\". In the bridge Amaya confesses: \\"Whatever you ask of me, I'll give it to you.\\" and then returns to the song's central question; \\"Who sails my boat?\\". Eurovision Remedios Amaya's performance of the song on stage in Munich, singing with the traditional Spanish 'cantaora' technique and dancing barefoot, was at the time described by BBC commentator Terry Wogan as \\"tempestuous\\" and \\"very, very ethnic indeed\\". The song was performed 7th on the night, following Turkey's √áetin Alp and The Short Waves with \\"Opera\\" and preceding the Switzerland's Mariella Farr√© with \\"Io cosi non ci sto\\".

The song went to number two for two weeks on the US dance chart. The song, which is said to be a response to the Crystal Waters track \\"Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless)\\", mostly consists of spoken word vocal samples performed by lead singer/vocalist E.V. Mystique. She is speaking to an unidentified female character who has apparently lost her job after giving her boss a bad attitude, resulting in homelessness. The song has a high camp value and was very popular in gay dance clubs. A sample lyric: \\"Attitude, attitude was all she sent/Now she can't afford antiperspirant/Books and school just give you the blues/But oh, dear girl, where are your shoes?\\" The title of the song is ironic, as though acceptable it is technically grammatically incorrect (the correct phrasing being 'I have gotten my education'). This aspect was, however, lost in other countries, since \\"gotten\\" - though technically correct - is not commonly used outside the USA and the title would generally be considered standard English. The single was first released as a white label 12\\" vinyl single given out to club DJ's. The song became so popular that record labels began vying to sign the band. During this process, the single was heavily bootlegged and sold by unscrupulous individuals who obtained the promotional white label single. As a result, when it was finally released by A&M; records on an official 12\\" and CD single, a new version entitled \\"Bootleggers Response\\" was included as a b-side. In this version the theme of the song is changed to address the actual bootlegger, accusing him of being forced to make money by bootlegging because he didn't get an education. A sample lyrics: \\"Are you a person with morals or couth who brushes their teeth in the morning?/Do you even have teeth?/Maybe with the money you made from the bootleg you can go and buy yourself...*A* tooth.\\" A music video was produced featuring Mystique portraying both herself and the \\"Miss Thing\\" subject of the lyrics. It takes place primarily in a classroom setting and parodies several other videos including \\"Mediate\\" by INXS and \\"People Are Still Having Sex\\" by LaTour.

History Carrying on the tradition of the Hellenic Navy in naval special operations, the unit was established in 1957 with help from the United States Navy's Underwater Demolition Team, when two Greek officers were sent to Little Creek in Virginia to evaluate a UDT operational capability for the Hellenic Navy. On their return, they trained a dozen men who formed the nucleus of the MYK cadre. Several diver teams (OYK) of MYK have been deployed on numerous occasions. They were deployed during the first Gulf War in 1991, providing assistance for the naval embargo against Saddam Hussein, boarding 217 suspect vessels. In 1996, the OYK were involved in the Imia crisis when Turkish commandos infiltrated the Greek rocky island of Imia. Small OYK teams dispersed in on a neighboring islet to acquire Turkish targets with the order to eliminate them if the pending political solution to the crisis and withdrawal of Turkish forces would fail. In 1997, during the violent unrest that erupted in neighboring Albania, the OYK were responsible for taking control of the international airport of Tirana and the evacuation of 240 foreign dignitaries from Albania (Operation Kosmas). Structure The DYK is organized into sections called Underwater Demolition Teams (), commonly known in their abbreviated form as OYK (,), that specialize in a particular area. Each section consists of 25 men split into five teams of five or alternatively into two subsections of twelve. Each OYK diver is awarded with the occupational specialty of Underwater Demolitionist () abbreviated Y/KT upon the successful completion of his training. OYK-1 and OYK-2 are the main assault sections of the OYK that conduct unconventional warfare, sabotage, DA raids, naval boarding and maritime counter-terrorism.. OYK-3: This section specializes in reconnaissance and hydrographic survey. Establishing and reconnoitering beach landing sites prior to a main amphibious assault, battlefield preparation and providing shore intelligence in the area of interest. OYK-4: are responsible for planting explosive charges on enemy shipping, EOD and naval mine clearance by organic means or in conjunction with a minesweeper vessel, as well as underwater demolition of obstacles that may prevent an amphibious landing. OYK-5 is a reserve section that is only activated in wartime or a declared state of emergency. It is made up of reservist personnel from the DYK and Officers and Petty Officers from the instructor body. ŒüŒ•Œö-5 is a deceptively small unit since it is manned by the all the previous OYK specialty schools, the Underwater Demolition school, the Unconventional War Boat school, the Underwater Swimmer Delivery school, and the Underwater Demolition Base () respectively, effectively the rest of the DYK. OYK training alt= The selection and training course lasts roughly seven months and is divided into three phases similar to that of the US Navy SEALs BUD/S course. The course has an extremely high failure rate similar to that of its US counterparts. The candidates will go on to airborne school and then continue to learn advanced naval special warfare techniques. OYK equipment The OYK is known to use various types of firearms to complete their missions with some guns being customized to be able to adapt to the marine environment of the OYK.https://www.tactical-life.com/firearms/greek- dyk-naval-spec-ops/ *Glock 17 9x19mm (does have sub-aqua spring cups to help with the marine environment to allow the gun to shoot right when it pulled out in the water and has an extended threaded barrel that can attach a suppressor if needed) *Glock 18 9x19mm (has been utilized in the past, thought the standard issue is the Glock 17) *Heckler & Koch MP5SD 9x19mm (MP5 variant used is the MP5A3) *M4 Carbine 5.56x45mm (is usually equipped with a Holographic sight and a fore-grip) *M4A1 5.56√ó45mm (is equipped with Acog holographic and sometimes with a magnifier √ó1, as well as fore-grips) *FN Minimi 7.62x51mm *M60E4 7.62x51mm *Springfield Armory M21 Sniper Weapon System 7.62x51mm *Benelli M3T 12 Gauge *Barrett M82A1 .50 BMG *Accuracy International AWM *M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System *M203 Grenade Launcher 2015 Independence Day Parade Controversy The OYK generated controversy at the Greek Independence Day parade of 2015, when it chanted a nationalistic refrain: ¬´ŒöŒ±Œπ œÑŒø œåŒΩŒµŒπœÅŒø ŒºŒ±œÇ ŒµŒØŒΩŒ±Œπ / œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ†œåŒªŒ∑ ŒµŒºŒµŒØœÇ ŒΩŒ± ŒºœÄŒøœçŒºŒµ / œÉŒ∑ŒºŒ±ŒØŒ± ŒΩŒ± œÖœàœéœÉŒøœÖŒºŒµ / œÑŒøŒΩ œçŒºŒΩŒø ŒµŒºŒµŒØœÇ ŒΩŒ± œÄŒøœçŒºŒµ¬ª, roughly translated as 'Our dream is to enter the City (Constantinople) to raise our flag and sing our anthem'.

Concretely, if X and Y are CW-complexes, and f : X ‚Üí Y is a continuous map, then f is said to be cellular, if f takes the n-skeleton of X to the n-skeleton of Y for all n, i.e. if f(X^n)\\\\subseteq Y^n for all n. The content of the cellular approximation theorem is then that any continuous map f : X ‚Üí Y between CW- complexes X and Y is homotopic to a cellular map, and if f is already cellular on a subcomplex A of X, then we can furthermore choose the homotopy to be stationary on A. From an algebraic topological viewpoint, any map between CW- complexes can thus be taken to be cellular.  Idea of proof  The proof can be given by induction after n, with the statement that f is cellular on the skeleton Xn. For the base case n=0, notice that every path-component of Y must contain a 0-cell. The image under f of a 0-cell of X can thus be connected to a 0-cell of Y by a path, but this gives a homotopy from f to a map which is cellular on the 0-skeleton of X. Assume inductively that f is cellular on the (n ‚àí 1)-skeleton of X, and let en be an n-cell of X. The closure of en is compact in X, being the image of the characteristic map of the cell, and hence the image of the closure of en under f is also compact in Y. Then it is a general result of CW-complexes that any compact subspace of a CW-complex meets (that is, intersects non-trivially) only finitely many cells of the complex. Thus f(en) meets at most finitely many cells of Y, so we can take e^k\\\\subseteq Y to be a cell of highest dimension meeting f(en). If k\\\\leq n, the map f is already cellular on en, since in this case only cells of the n-skeleton of Y meets f(en), so we may assume that k > n. It is then a technical, non-trivial result (see Hatcher) that the restriction of f to X^{n-1}\\\\cup e^n can be homotoped relative to Xn-1 to a map missing a point p ‚àà ek. Since Yk ‚àí {p} deformation retracts onto the subspace Yk-ek, we can further homotope the restriction of f to X^{n-1}\\\\cup e^n to a map, say, g, with the property that g(en) misses the cell ek of Y, still relative to Xn-1. Since f(en) met only finitely many cells of Y to begin with, we can repeat this process finitely many times to make f(e^n) miss all cells of Y of dimension larger than n. We repeat this process for every n-cell of X, fixing cells of the subcomplex A on which f is already cellular, and we thus obtain a homotopy (relative to the (n ‚àí 1)-skeleton of X and the n-cells of A) of the restriction of f to Xn to a map cellular on all cells of X of dimension at most n. Using then the homotopy extension property to extend this to a homotopy on all of X, and patching these homotopies together, will finish the proof. For details, consult Hatcher.  Applications   Some homotopy groups  The cellular approximation theorem can be used to immediately calculate some homotopy groups. In particular, if n then \\\\pi_n(S^k)=0. Give S^n and S^k their canonical CW-structure, with one 0-cell each, and with one -cell for S^n and one -cell for S^k. Any base-point preserving map f\\\\colon S^n \\\\to S^k is then homotopic to a map whose image lies in the -skeleton of S^k, which consists of the base point only. That is, any such map is nullhomotopic.  Cellular approximation for pairs  Let f:(X,A)‚Üí(Y,B) be a map of CW-pairs, that is, f is a map from X to Y, and the image of A\\\\subseteq X \\\\, under f sits inside B. Then f is homotopic to a cellular map (X,A)‚Üí(Y,B). To see this, restrict f to A and use cellular approximation to obtain a homotopy of f to a cellular map on A. Use the homotopy extension property to extend this homotopy to all of X, and apply cellular approximation again to obtain a map cellular on X, but without violating the cellular property on A. As a consequence, we have that a CW-pair (X,A) is n-connected, if all cells of X-A have dimension strictly greater than n: If i\\\\leq n \\\\,, then any map (D^i,\\\\partial D^i) \\\\,‚Üí(X,A) is homotopic to a cellular map of pairs, and since the n-skeleton of X sits inside A, any such map is homotopic to a map whose image is in A, and hence it is 0 in the relative homotopy group \\\\pi_i(X,A) \\\\,. We have in particular that (X,X^n)\\\\, is n-connected, so it follows from the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair (X,X^n) \\\\, that we have isomorphisms \\\\pi_i(X^n) \\\\,‚Üí\\\\pi_i(X) \\\\, for all i and a surjection \\\\pi_n(X^n) \\\\,‚Üí\\\\pi_n(X) \\\\,.  CW approximation  For every space X one can construct a CW complex Z and a weak homotopy equivalence f \\\\colon Z\\\\to X that is called a CW approximation to X. CW approximation, being a weak homotopy equivalence, induces isomorphisms on homology and cohomology groups of X. Thus one often can use CW approximation to reduce a general statement to a simpler version that only concerns CW complexes. CW approximation is constructed inducting on skeleta Z_i of Z, so that the maps (f_i)_*\\\\colon \\\\pi_k (Z_i)\\\\to \\\\pi_k(X) are isomorphic for k< i and are onto for k=i (for any basepoint). Then Z_{i+1} is built from Z_i by attaching (i+1)-cells that (for all basepoints) * are attached by the mappings S^i \\\\to Z_i that generate the kernel of \\\\pi_i (Z_i)\\\\to \\\\pi_i(X) (and are mapped to X by the contraction of the corresponding spheroids) * are attached by constant mappings and are mapped to X to generate \\\\pi_{i+1}(X) (or \\\\pi_{i+1}(X)/(f_i)_* (\\\\pi_{i+1} (Z_i)) ). The cellular approximation ensures then that adding (i+1)-cells doesn't affect \\\\pi_k (Z_i)\\\\stackrel{\\\\cong}{\\\\to} \\\\pi_k (X) for k _, while \\\\pi_i (Z_i) gets factored by the classes of the attachment mappings S^i \\\\to Z_i of these cells giving \\\\pi_i (Z_{i+1})\\\\stackrel{\\\\cong}{\\\\to} \\\\pi_i (X). Surjectivity of \\\\pi_{i+1} (Z_{i+1})\\\\to \\\\pi_{i+1} (X) is evident from the second step of the construction.

History Letter of Gratitude to Ottoman Empire During the Great Famine in Ireland of the 1840s, Ottoman Sultan Abd√ºlmecid donated ¬£1,000 to famine relief. A letter written by Irish notables in the Ottoman archives explicitly thanks the Sultan for his help. According to legend, the Sultan had originally intended to send ¬£10,000, but either British diplomats or his own ministers requested that the Sultan send only ¬£1,000, so as not to donate more than Queen Victoria, who had sent ¬£2,000.Christine Kinealy (2013), Charity and the Great Hunger in Ireland: The Kindness of Strangers, pp. 115, 118 He is also said to have sent three or five ships full of food. The British administration allegedly attempted to block the ships, but by local tradition the food arrived secretly at Drogheda harbour and was left there by Ottoman sailors. Shipping records relating to the port appear not to have survived. Newspaper reports suggest that ships from Thessaloniki in the Ottoman Empire sailed up the River Boyne in May 1847, although it has also been claimed that the river was dry at the time. In 1995, the Drogheda town hall erected a placard in commemoration. In 2012, plans were announced to produce a film on the subject, starring Colin Farrell and several Turkish stars. The claim that he had wanted to give ¬£10,000 first appears in Taylor & Mackay's Life and Times of Sir Robert Peel (1851), but the book is not referenced and no source is given. A second source, dating to 1894, is more explicit: the Irish nationalist William J. O'Neill Daunt claimed to have heard from the son of the sultan's personal physician that he \\"had intended to give ¬£10,000 to the famine-stricken Irish, but was deterred by the English ambassador, Lord Cowley, as Her Majesty, who had only subscribed ¬£1000, would have been annoyed had a foreign sovereign given a larger sum‚Ä¶\\" Economic relations In 2011, bilateral trade volume reached 1,19 billion USD with an Irish surplus of 485 million USD.

History Trevandrum Bazaar (p.102, 1891), London Missionary Society Chala was officially established towards the end of 18th century by Raja Kesavadas, Dewan of Travancore. The idea was to make Chalai bazar the central point for the supply of commodities to the Travancore kingdom. The Killi and Karamana rivers nearby was used to transport goods to the market. However, Mathilakom records of the Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple talk of a large market place that existed ‚Äònear‚Äô the temple, at least a century and a half before. Going further back to the 13th century, the composition Ananthapuravarnanam, which describes the capital city in detail, vividly describes a bustling marketplace with a fish market, textile market, provision market and so on. Merchants used to come in ships to trade at the market. Location Chala market is located opposite of te East fort central bus stand where all the city buses terminate. The main entrance is located at the junction between Gandhi park and KSRTC bus garage. This entrance takes you to the Chala market road which is the main shopping area. This road terminates on the Kanyakumari highway (earlier known NH-47 and now renamed as NH-66) at a distance of about 1.5 km. Shopping The market is spread through the narrow 2 km road connecting Killipalam and East Fort, which runs from East to West. The by- lanes too have an array of shops. The shopping street also consists of Karupattikada Juma Masjid, which is popularly known as 'Chala Juma Masjid'. This juma masjid was built in the first quarter of the 20th Century and is considered to be one of the oldest mosques in the district. Shops The market sells almost every commodity, from fruits and vegetables, gold and silver to paint and hardware. Most shops are open from 9 am to 8 pm daily except Sundays. The place gets very crowded in the evenings. A number of good eateries also dot the area. The 2 km stretch is one of the busiest shopping streets in Kerala. Mubarak Hotel which started in 1970 is one of the most oldest restaurants in Chala. Another notable shop was Swamy and Brothers of Chala, once the go-to-place for all manner of threads and embroidery paraphernalia and dress materials. The shop was winded up in 2015. Footfalls Peak Shopping Seasons The Peak Shopping Season is during festivals of Vishu, Onam and Christmas. Chala market is the one place to visit during Onam Festival because it is here that one gets all kinds of flowers needed for the celebration.

During his career, Summers flew many first flights on prototype aircraft, (a record of 54 by a test pilot), from the Supermarine Spitfire, to the Vickers Valiant. He also holds the current second place record for 366 general types tested, below Eric \\"Winkle\\" Brown's 487.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1954/1954%20-%200801.html Career Captain Joseph \\"Mutt\\" Summers received his nickname \\"Mutt\\" during his early days in the RAF from his habit of urinating before take off on the small rear wheel or skid of the aircraft he was testing. This led to his being accused of christening his aircraft like a dog marking its territory. He did this because he was aware that during some crashes a full bladder could prove fatal. Paul Brickhill (in The Dam Busters) referred to the two test pilots Joseph Summers and Jeffrey Quill, as \\"Mutt\\" and \\"Jeff\\", alluding to the characters in the pioneering American comic strip created by Harry Conway \\"Bud\\" Fisher. Summers was granted a short-service commission in the RAF at the age of 21, and learned to fly on Avro 504s and Sopwith Snipes at No. 2 F.T.S. (Flying Training School). He passed out from RAF Digby in 1924 and was posted to No. 29 Fighter Squadron, equipped with Snipes and later with Gloster Grebes. After six months he was transferred to the single-seater flight at Martlesham Heath, where he helped to test, among other types, the Gloster Gamecock, Bristol Bulldog, Hawker Hornbill and Avro Avenger. He flew for five years at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Martlesham Heath, including periods on loan to Blackburn Aircraft and Avro.Barker, R Biplane to Monoplane, Putnam's History of Aircraft: Research & Test Flying pp 212-3 He left his post at Martlesham in May, 1929, and the following month joined Vickers Aviation Ltd, as their chief test pilot. A year later he became chief test pilot to the Supermarine Aviation Works and in that capacity flew the first Supermarine Spitfire in 1936. Summers tested numerous fighters and bombers through the 1930s. He flew the prototype of Barnes Wallis's geodetic aircraft the Vickers Wellesley bomber in June 1935. He was landing this aircraft on 23 July when the port undercarriage collapsed, resulting in several months in the workshops to repair serious damage to the wing. He flew the prototype Wellington bomber, K4049, with Wallis and Trevor Westbrook (the factory's general manager) aboard, at Brooklands on 15 June 1936. Through the late 1930s and into the 1940s Summers continued to test numerous aircraft and iron out issues with existing airframes. K5054 prototype Supermarine Spitfire On 5 March 1936 Jeffrey Quill flew Summers in Vickers' Miles Falcon from Martlesham to Eastleigh Aerodrome, where he was to fly the new F.37/34 fighter, which on arrival had been changed to K5054. Summers (then chief test pilot for Vickers (Aviation) Ltd.) took the prototype K5054 on its first flight from Eastleigh Aerodrome (later Southampton Airport). After an eight-minute flight, Summers landed the prototype. K5054 was fitted with a new propeller and Summers flew the aircraft again on 10 March; during this flight the undercarriage was retracted for the first time. After the fourth flight a new engine was fitted, and Summers left the test-flying to his assistants, Jeffrey Quill and George Pickering. They soon discovered that the Spitfire was a very good aircraft, but not perfect. The rudder was over-sensitive and the top speed was just , a little faster than Sydney Camm's new Merlin-powered Hawker Hurricane. A new and better-shaped wooden propeller meant the Spitfire reached in level flight in mid-May, then Summers flew the K5054 to RAF Martlesham Heath and handed the aircraft over to Squadron Leader Anderson of the Aeroplane & Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE;). Second World War Shortly before the Second World War, Summers was succeeded by Jeffrey Quill, his assistant and prot√©g√©, who took over testing single-seater prototypes during the war. During this period of the war, all leading test pilots of the main aircraft manufacturers were ordered by RAF Command to support Groups No. 10, 11, 12 and 13. Most test pilots came from Brooklands where the central manufacture and testing of military aircraft took place. Summers became a supervising RAF fighter tester specifically for No. 11 Group RAF, commanded by Air Vice Marshal Keith Park, during the Battle of Britain. Being a test pilot in this capacity and a former RAF officer, Summers' duty was as a home guard non- combatant position. During the summer of 1940 Summers was to fly between all No. 11 Group's airfields in south east England to test fighter aircraft and ensure all they were safe to be used by 11 Group pilots after each battle. Any problems were reported to each airfield's maintenance crews. Also pilots were issued requisition tickets for a new aircraft if Summers found an aircraft to be unserviceable. =Propeller failures= During mid-1940, Jeffrey Quill informed Summers about a problem with propeller fatigue on early versions of the Mk1 Hurricane and Spitfire. The problem could lead to the propeller detaching itself during flight‚Äîsomething Quill had experienced himself. Early in the Battle of Britain during an attack over south east England, pilot James Harry \\"Ginger\\" Lacey of 501 Squadron from RAF Middle Wallop, complained he had a problem with his Hurricane's engine, and felt it was too dangerous to accelerate any faster than he was. After Lacey landed the Hurricane, Summers took it up on a five-minute test flight. At Summers noticed a problem with the engine when accelerating to a certain speed. Whilst at full throttle, the propeller sheared off the aircraft. The prop ripped off the cowling and as Summers had no parachute with him it was necessary to glide the plane back to the air field. =The Bouncing Bomb= In preparation for the Dambusters Raid in May 1943, Summers was test pilot for the experimental bouncing bomb dropped from a Vickers Wellington near Portland, Dorset, a job given to him by close friend Barnes Wallis. He was depicted by Patrick Barr in the film made of the events. Postwar career Summer's flew Britain's first postwar airliner the Vickers VC.1 Viking, adapted from the Wellington bomber, on 22 June 1945. This was followed by the military troop transport the Vickers Valetta, which Summers flew on 30 June 1947 at Brooklands. The prototype of the turboprop civil transport Vickers Viscount was flown from Wisley Airfield by Summers and Jock Bryce for 10 minutes on 16 July 1948. The very last prototype to have Summers at the controls on its maiden flight was the Vickers Valiant, once again with Jock Bryce as co-pilot, flown from Wisley Airfield on 18 May 1951. Accidents Summers experienced a number of accidents and crashes during his career. During a test flight on the first dual Gloster Grebe, the aircraft spun flat to within of the ground, coming out completely stalled with full engine. In a full-power dive in the Hawker Hawfinch, a fuselage bay collapsed at about terminal-velocity speed; the anchorage for the Sutton harness was in the tail and this pulled him back and nearly broke his neck. While testing the first Bulldog, Summers spun down from , having tried to abandon the machine at . He had released his harness and was on the centre section when the machine stopped rotating and went into a dive, enabling him to regain control by pushing the stick with his foot. Thereupon he climbed back into the cockpit and landed. His most dramatic escape was in 1945, when structural failure in a Vickers Warwick caused full rudder to be involuntarily applied at over Weybridge, Surrey. Summers had no alternative but to crash- land the aircraft into an avenue of trees, with a ploughed field at the end. When the aircraft had come to rest, flames emerged from both engine air intakes. Fortunately, some farm labourers had time to get into the fuselage and extricate Summers and his flight engineer before a major fire started. Records What made him the best at what he was, and why he was predominantly chosen above other test pilots, was his unique ability to identify issues with any aircraft just by sitting in the cockpit and listening to the sound the aircraft made in flight. In his career, he clocked up over 5,600 flying hours, which is the equivalent of taking off in an aircraft on 1 January and landing at the end of October. By 1946 he had tested 310 different aircraft.Flight 16 May 1946 pp494-495 Summers numbered among his firsts the first flight of a pure jet civil aircraft (the Nene-Viking, a Vickers Viking airframe fitted with Nene jet engines) on 6 April 1948, the first flight of civil turboprop airliner (the Vickers Viscount) on 16 July 1948 and the initial flight of Britain's first four-jet bomber (Vickers Valiant) on 18 May 1951. By the time he retired, he had achieved 366 general types, second only to the Guinness world record holder Eric \\"Winkle\\" Brown who has 487. Summers still holds the world record of 54 \\"Prototype First Flights\\". On 15 December 2016, in a Boroondara Council meeting, Joseph Summers had the street formerly known as Oliver Street renamed, to honour his work in the military.

The European Organisation for Rare Diseases established the day in 2008 to raise awareness for unknown or overlooked illnesses. According to that organization, treatment for many rare diseases is insufficient, as are the social networks to support individuals with rare diseases and their families; furthermore, while there were already numerous days dedicated to sufferers of individual diseases (such as AIDS, cancer, etc.), there had previously not been a day for representing sufferers of rare diseases. In 2009 Rare Disease Day went global as the National Organization for Rare Disorders mobilized 200 rare disease patient advocacy organizations in the United States while organizations in China, Australia, Taiwan, and Latin America also lead efforts in their respective countries to coordinate activities and promote the day. History The first Rare Disease Day was coordinated by the European Organisation for Rare Diseases (EURORDIS) and held on February 29, 2008 in numerous European nations and in Canada through the Canadian Organization for Rare Disorders. The date was chosen because February 29 is a \\"rare day,\\" and 2008 was the 25th anniversary of the passing of the Orphan Drug Act in the United States. Individuals observing Rare Disease Day took part in walks and press conferences to raise public awareness of rare diseases, organized fundraisers, and wrote en masse to government representatives; health-related non-profit organizations across numerous countries also held events, gatherings, and campaigns. The day also included an open session of the European Parliament specifically dedicated to discussing policy issues relating to rare diseases. The days leading up to Rare Disease Day included other policy-related events in numerous locations, such as a reception in the British Parliament where policymakers met with individuals with rare diseases to discuss issues such as \\"equal access and availability of prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation.\\" In 2009, Rare Disease Day was observed for the first time in Panama, Colombia, Argentina, Australia, Serbia, Russia,https://www.rarediseaseday.org/country/ru/russian-federation the People's Republic of China, and the United States. In the United States, the National Organization for Rare Disorders signed on to coordinate Rare Disease Day and collaborated with The Discovery Channel and the show Mystery Diagnosis, as well about 180 other partners, to organize activities across the country for the observance of Rare Disease Day. Several United States state governments issued proclamations regarding Rare Disease Day. In Europe, over 600 patient advocacy and support organizations, again coordinated by EURORDIS, also planned events. In 2010, 46 countries participated. Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Georgia, and three African countries joined the event for the first time. In 2011, 46 countries participated in the event. By 2012, thousands of patient advocacy organizations had gotten involved, including more than 600 partners working with NORD in the US to promote Rare Disease Day. By 2014, 84 countries were participating, with over four hundred events worldwide. Nine new countries participated in 2014; Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, Guinea, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Oman, and Paraguay. In 2018, Cape Verde, Ghana, Syria, Togo, and Trinidad and Tobago participated for the first time, with 80 nations participating in that year's events.

Transport of field artillery is difficult through the moist ground and riparian forest adjacent to low-gradient rivers. Traditional naval artillery is mounted on deep-draft vessels unsuited for operations in shallow rivers. Vietnam War A US riverine battery in the Vietnam War Fixed firing platforms on rivers were found unsatisfactory France developed the Dinassaut (assault river division) concept early in their effort to fight communist guerrillas in French Indochina. The value of artillery was demonstrated by French ships when coastal Mon Cay became the only French garrison along the Chinese border to survive a 1950 Viet Minh offensive.Mesko 1985 p.5 During the Vietnam War, the United States employed riverine artillery due to the difficulty of transporting and emplacing artillery pieces in marshy areas. The formation of a riverine task force (composed of 2d Brigade of the 9th Infantry Division and the U.S. Navy River Assault Flotilla 1) increased the importance of artillery support in riverine areas, and fixed locations near river areas proved unsatisfactory. In December 1966, 1st Battalion, 7th Artillery positioned M101A1 105mm howitzers aboard LCM-6 landing craft, with the intent that the craft be towed to a supported area and moored to a riverbank.Forbes & Williams 1987 p.102 Later, it was established that the LCM-6 was too small to serve effectively, and howitzers were positioned on Navy AMMI pontoon barges. When these proved to difficult to move and to have too deep of a draft, barges formed of Navy P-1 pontoons were the workable solution.Forbes & Williams 1987 p.101 M101A1, and later M102 howitzers were mounted onto a baseplate welded to the barge deck, allowing the howitzer to be traversed 360 degrees. A complete battery of riverine 105mm artillery consisted of three howitzer barges, and five LCM-8s for support staff such as the Fire Direction Center.

A recent review of studies shows pinoline and melatonin to be effective at reducing the lipid peroxidation. Studies included both human and animal subjects. The studies‚Äô results support that pinoline has antioxidant properties. Lipopolysaccharide is produced by Gram-negative bacteria and stimulates the production of free radicals which in turn cause lipid peroxidation. A recent study compared the effectiveness of melatonin and other similar compounds on the lipopolysaccharide induced lipid peroxidation. The results showed support for pinoline‚Äôs ability to reduce damage from lipid peroxidation. Pinoline was also shown to be more effective than vitamin E at reducing lipopolysaccharide activity in the retina. Another recent study compared the antioxidant properties of compounds from the tryptophan metabolic pathway in the pineal gland against oxidative damage to the lipids and proteins of synaptosomes. Synaptosomes isolated from rat brains were used in an experiment assessing damage by measuring malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxyalkenal, and carbonyl content in the proteins. Pinoline was shown to be the most powerful antioxidant. These results support the evidence for pinoline‚Äôs antioxidant abilities and the potential to protect against oxidative damage.

The idol of Shri Brahma ji is made of Marble. The carving work however is unique. The foundation of the temple was laid on 20 April 1961 but the deity was enthroned on 6 May 1984. The chief deity is lord Brahma, his consort Gayatri's idol is also by the side of the chief deity. The idol is indeed unique piece of sculptural elegance. There are idols of various vedic sages Maharishi Uddalak, Maharishi Vashishta, Maharishi Kashyap, Maharishi Gautam, Maharishi Pippalada, Maharishi Parashara and Maharishi Bhardwaj. Rajpurohit brahmins trace their vedic lineage from these sages. The temple has been built mainly by the Rajpurohit community. A big condoned off place is there for birds to pick up grain. Every day 200 Kilogram of grain is fed to birds. The vast lodge can house hundreds of visitors in its 102 rooms and 11 halls. Charges are very nominal. The present Mahant (Manager priest) Sant Tulsaram ji Maharaj is doing a commendable job in propagating the message of love and peace along with heading various programs for social welfare. An education institution, in the name of Sant Khetaram ji Maharaj is being run. A higher secondary school is also proposed. Free charitable preparation of food is performed every day which is served to visitors and devotees much like the langar pratha common among Sikhs.

She was bred by the prominent French horseman Daniel Wildenstein through his breeding company, Dayton Ltd. Out of the mare War Path, her sire was Wildenstein's stallion Faraway Son, a Group 1 winner and the 1971 French Champion Miler. Racing in France In 1977, the three-year-old Waya competed in France for Daniel Wildenstein, where she was conditioned for racing by the Argentine-born trainer Angel Penna, a future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee. A winner in her debut at Saint-Cloud Racecourse, Waya also won the Group 3 Prix de Royaumont at Chantilly and the Group 2 Prix de l'Op√©ra at Longchamp. She ended her French racing career in October 1977 with a record of three wins, two seconds, and a third from her eight starts. Sent to the United States For the 1978 racing season, Waya and her trainer Angel Penna competed on the New York Racing Association circuit, where she won the Flower Bowl Handicap and the Diana Handicap against fillies. In winning the Diana Handicap, she equaled the world record of 1:45 2/5 for 1‚Öõ miles on grass. She then beat her male counterparts in the Aqueduct Turf Classic Invitational Stakes and the Man o' War Stakes. Against a mostly male field of top American and European horses in the Washington, D.C. International Stakes at Laurel Park Racecourse in Laurel, Maryland, Waya ran third behind winner Mac Diarmida, whom she beat in the Man o' War Stakes. New owners and a Championship year Waya was sold to Americans George Strawbridge and Peter Brant, who campaigned her in 1979. Under new trainer David Whiteley, she continued to perform at top levels despite being assigned high weights of as much as one hundred and thirty-one pounds. Of her five major wins that year, she once again defeated her male counterparts in the Edgemere Handicap and in her first-ever race on dirt, won the Top Flight Handicap at New York's Aqueduct Racetrack. She was voted the 1979 Eclipse Award as the American Champion Older Female Horse. As a broodmare In early 1980, Waya was retired to broodmare duty at Derry Meeting Farm near Cochranville, Pennsylvania. She was bred to some of the world's top stallions including Red Ransom, Danzig, Seattle Slew, Riverman, Alydar, and twice to Gulch, Mr. Prospector and Nijinsky. Her first foal by Nijinsky was a filly named Vidalia, who raced in Italy and was the 1983 Italian Champion Two-Year-Old Filly. Of her ten other runners, Waya produced eight winners, of which one earned a graded stakes victory. As a result of complications from laminitis, the twenty-seven-year-old Waya was humanely euthanized at Derry Meeting Farm on December 12, 2001.

The process of addling involves temporarily removing fertilized eggs from the nest, testing for embryo development, terminating embryo development, and placing the egg back in the nest. Returning the egg to the nest misleads the goose into believing the egg is still developing. Otherwise, the goose would begin laying again. In order to work effectively, addling must be conducted in a manner that does not arouse the suspicion of the goose, and must not change the odor, appearance or texture of the egg. Effective addling techniques are disseminated by the Humane Society of the United States and Internet Center for Wildlife Damage Management. Perhaps the easiest way to addle is to coat the egg with corn oil, thereby depriving the embryo of oxygen and killing it.Humane Society of the United States. (March 2004) Canada Goose egg addling protocol. p.4. Canada geese are covered in the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 According to the Humane Society of the United States, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service no longer requires special permits to addle eggs in the contiguous United States, but one must register with the Service first (Resident Canada Goose Nest and Egg Registration Site). Major implementation Goose egg addling was predominantly used in the aftermath of the plane crash of US Airways Flight 1549 on January 15, 2009. Following an investigation by officials, which determined the plane crash was caused by a bird strike of Canada Geese, an estimated 1,739 goose eggs were coated with oil in an effort to prevent any similar incidents from occurring.

Otis developed on September 28, 2005, off the western coast of Mexico, from a tropical wave that emerged from the western coast of Africa and traversed the Atlantic Ocean during the preceding several weeks. After attaining tropical storm status on September 29, the storm moved in a generally northwestward direction for most of its duration. It ultimately peaked at Category 2 intensity on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale before beginning to weaken. The storm degenerated into a tropical depression on October 3 and dissipated fully on October 5, near the coast of Baja California Sur. Preparations for the storm were completed on the Peninsula; tropical cyclone watches and warnings were declared and numerous shelters opened. However, the storm's effects were minimal, and limited to gusty winds with heavy rainfall. No major damage was reported. Meteorological history The origins of Hurricane Otis are believed to have been in a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on September 9. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, spawning Tropical Depression Seventeen on September 17. The southern portion of the wave continued westward, crossing into the eastern Pacific Ocean on September 22. As the wave entered a monsoon-like environment, convection increased on September 23. An associated area of disorganized clouds and thunderstorms persisted off the coast of Mexico for several days, although due to wind shear and its proximity to land, short-term tropical cyclone development--if any-- was expected to occur slowly. On September 27, it began to show signs of organization; the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked upon the potential for a tropical cyclone to develop within the next day. It is estimated that the system became a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on September 28, while located about to the south of Manzanillo, Mexico. The depression moved slowly toward the southwest and became better organized, despite a decrease in the coverage of deep convection. By late September 28 the depression was approaching tropical storm status; it turned to the northwest and attained winds of at 0600 UTC on September 29, at which time it was assigned the name Otis. That evening, wind shear relented and conditions became more favorable for the storm's intensification. Convection wrapped almost fully around the center, and early on September 3, Otis was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale. Shortly thereafter, a ragged eye feature developed; it quickly became better defined as it entered the scope of weather radar in Cabo San Lucas. Otis began gradually entering cooler ocean waters, although the National Hurricane Center noted in one of its discussions on the system that the environment was still warm enough to support a stronger storm. The hurricane continued drifting northwestward, and early on October 1 it reached peak intensity at Category 2 status. At the time, maximum sustained winds were at 105 mph (165 km/h) and barometric pressure was recorded at 970 mbar (hPa; 28.64 inHg). Hours later, however, it began to weaken, a trend that continued due to southwesterly wind shear and dry air. The cloud pattern associated with the hurricane deteriorated on October 2, and the center of circulation was separated from the convective activity. Otis weakened to a tropical storm and drifted erratically toward the north-northwest as a result of weak steering currents. Over increasingly cold waters, the cyclone further weakened to a depression on October 3 and consisted of a small swirl of low- level clouds. It became a remnant low pressure area the next day. The system abruptly turned southeastward and drifted parallel to the coast of the Baja California Peninsula until dissipating on October 5. Preparations and impact On September 30, the first tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued with the declaration of tropical storm warnings and hurricane watches along portions of the east and west coasts of the Baja California Peninsula. For several days the advisories were adjusted and amended, and on October 1, a hurricane warning was posted for the west coast of Baja California, from Agua Blanca to San Andresito. By October 2, all watches and warnings were discontinued on the east coast of the peninsula, and the remaining advisories were lifted the next day. High winds and heavy rainfall were anticipated. In advance of the storm, the governor of Baja California Sur, Narciso Ag√∫ndez Monta√±o, ordered emergency personnel to Comond√∫, Lorteo, and Mulege. Approximately 700 families fled to shelters in Cabo San Lucas; elsewhere, an additional 200 families evacuated in San Jose del Cabo. Some residents in Miraflores and Santiago also left their homes. Agundez asked soldiers to assist the isla Magdalena and Margarita in preparing for the storm. Five communities in Mexico, including Cabo San Lucas, declared a state of emergency. Authorities throughout the region opened numerous shelters, and in some locations, police officers went door-to-door asking residents to leave. The port in Cabo San Lucas was closed due to the storm's threat, although the airport remained open. Although the center of Otis remained offshore, tropical storm-force winds were reported at higher elevations over portions of southern Baja California. At Cabo San Lucas, an automated weather station recorded a wind gust to on September 30, with sustained winds of . There, periods of heavy rainfall mixed with fair skies as the storm passed. No damages or fatalities were reported, although some media reports indicated that the storm caused flooding in parts of the southern Baja California peninsula. Offshore, two ships reported tropical-storm-force winds in association with the storm: the Volendam on October 3, and the Star Harmonia on October 1.

A single-engined biplane intended to replace Short's successful Type 184, only two were built, the Fairey III being preferred. Development and design In 1917, the British Admiralty released Specification N.2B for a long-range patrol seaplane to replace the Short Type 184 in Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) service. The Short Brothers' response to this specification, designated Short N.2B was a single-engined, unequal span biplane with two-bay folding wings. While Short's wanted to fit a Rolls-Royce Eagle engine, this was rejected by the Admiralty owing to an expected shortage of these engines, with the Sunbeam Maori substituted.Barnes 1967, p.138. Eight prototype Short N.2Bs were ordered together with competing aircraft from Fairey (the Fairey III). The first prototype flew in December 1917.Mason 1994, p.99. When it was tested at the Marine Experimental Aircraft Depot on the Isle of Grain in February 1918, it showed performance no better than the Short 184 with the same engine. While modification with a different propeller and attempts to reduce drag did improve performance, the Fairey III was preferred, being ordered into production in versions powered by both the Maori and Eagle engines, with only the first two prototype Short aircraft being built.Barnes 1967, pp.138-139. In May 1919, Shorts modified the second prototype with an Eagle engine salvaged from the modified Short N.1B Shirl Shamrock, which had crashed during an attempt to cross the Atlantic, the revised aircraft showing greatly improved climb rate but with speed only increased by 8 mph (13 km/h).

During his 52 years in the United States he created works throughout the country, notably in New York and San Francisco. He also taught sculpture. History Water Sprites at Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition in San FranciscoBorn in Bologna, Italy, on October 29, 1879, Leo Lentelli studied in Bologna and Rome and worked as a sculptor in his native land. Immigrating to the United States in 1903 at the age of 24, Lentelli initially assisted in the studios of several established sculptors. In 1911 he entered the Architectural League exhibition and won the Avery Prize. The following year he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Chosen to provide sculptural ornament for the Panama-Pacific Exposition, Lentelli moved to San Francisco in 1914. He collaborated with Frederick George Richard Roth and Stirling Calder. Calder has been credited with aiding Lentelli in developing his own style. An example can be seen in his Water Sprites. > His long-limbed figures with hair and draperies in loose frills like seaweed > made striking fountain statues and lent themselves well to architectural > decoration. The surfaces were left rough for the sake of variety of texture > and to give an effect of spontaneity. He also participated as a sculptor in the city's artistic renewal, which took place after the 1906 earthquake and fire. While in San Francisco he taught at the California School of Fine Arts. Significant works from this period include the Five Symbolic Figures at the Old Main Library elevated above the street entrance of the Larkin Street entrance. Still a resident of San Francisco, he made the ornament for the Orpheum Theater, then known as the Historic American Theater, at Saint Louis and created two-figure groups depicting pioneers on the Dennis Sullivan Gateway at Denver, Colorado. Returning to New York City, he began teaching at the Art Students League. He also taught at the Cooper Union and became an academician of the National Academy of Design. Lentelli gained fame through his The Savior with Sixteen Angels for the reredos at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York, as well as his public sculpture for the Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco. Among his important works are an equestrian statue of Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, Virginia (collaboration with Henry Shrady), and a 1932 monument to Cardinal Gibbons located north of Meridian Hill Park in Washington, D.C. A benignity is achieved in the latter, its decorative element accented in the carved chair and graceful folds of the cassock. During the New Deal Lentelli created four statues for the Post Office in Oyster Bay, Long Island, dated 1937: a terracotta bust of Theodore Roosevelt, two terracotta panels and ornamentation at the base of the flagpole. During the same period, he also created sculpture for the post office of North East, Pennsylvania. His statue of Apollo and a musical muse, located in a lunette of Steinway Hall on 57th Street in New York City, was covered when the building was sold, but is again on display. Other ornamental figures include Bagnante, a Diana, and Leda. In addition to figures, Lentelli sculpted panels and bas-reliefs for many distinguished buildings. He ornamented a frieze on the Free Academy building at Corning, New York with a panel of children's figures. Lentelli's bas-reliefs on the International Building at Rockefeller Center are considered among his most important works. Among Leo Lentelli's marks of recognition are the 1922 Medal of Honor of the Architectural League of New York and Gold Medal at the National Academy of Design exhibition in 1927. He was a fellow of the National Sculpture Society, an associate member of the National Academy of Design and a member of the Architectural League of New York. In 1955 Lentelli retired to Italy and died on December 31, 1961 in Rome.

Formosan sika, like most of the terrestrial fauna and flora of Taiwan, arrived on the island during Pleistocene glacial periods when lower sea levels connected Taiwan to the Asian mainland. Appearance and behavior Sika stand 90‚Äì120 cm at the shoulder. Males are larger and bear deciduous antlers. The summer coat is light brownish, with obvious white spots, while in winter their coat is darker and the spots fade. Captive-bred specimen Young sika deer tethered in Green Island, Taiwan Range and habitat The natural distribution of sika on Taiwan was in the woodlands from sea level up to about 300 m elevation. Sika, like many deer, prefer areas of mixed forest, scrub, and open land. Under natural conditions the low-lying alluvial plain that stretches from present-day Taipei along the west coast almost to the southern tip of the island were prime deer habitat and natural populations would have been quite dense. Status Sika populations in Taiwan have been heavily influenced by human activity for the past four hundred years. Until the early 17th century the human population of Taiwan was low and comprised mostly Austronesian peoples who had been living on the island for thousands of years. During the 17th century immigration from the Chinese mainland increased dramatically in response to political instability in China and economic opportunities on Taiwan, which from 1624 until 1662 was controlled by the Dutch East India Company (VOC). The VOC, operating from the port of Taoyuan (modern-day Anping, Tainan) in southwestern Taiwan, established a trading post whose main business was the export of sika skins to Europe. During the six decades of Dutch activity two to four million sika skins were exported to Europe.Ê±üÊ®πÁîü„ÄÇ 1985„ÄÇÊ¢ÖËä±ÈπøËàáÂè∞ÁÅ£Êó©ÊúüÊ≠∑Âè≤Èóú‰øÇ‰πãÁ†îÁ©∂, Á¨¨3‚Äì62È†Å„ÄÇÂè∞ÁÅ£Ê¢ÖËä±ÈπøÂæ©ËÇ≤‰πãÁ†îÁ©∂‰∏ÉÂçÅÂõõÂπ¥Â∫¶Â†±Âëä„ÄÇÂÖßÊîøÈÉ®ÁáüÂª∫ÁΩ≤Â¢æ‰∏ÅÂúãÂÆ∂ÂÖ¨ÂúíÁÆ°ÁêÜËôï Exporting was reduced when the Dutch were forced out of Taiwan in 1662, but continued throughout the Qing period with a switch to Japan as the major export market.The Plight of the Formosan Sika. wildatheart.org.tw The intensive hunting of sika during the Dutch era must have severely decreased the population of sika. Sika populations continued to decline over the next few centuries as the human population expanded‚Äîthe natural habitat of sika in the lowland plains was steadily converted to farmland, and later urbanized, as the human population increased. Hunting also continued. As a result, wild sika populations decreased steadily, and in 1969 the last known wild sika was killed.McCullough, D. R. 1974. Status of Larger Mammals in Taiwan.

In 1984 Taiwan‚Äôs Council of Agriculture funded the Sika Deer Reintroduction Project, based at Kenting National Park on the southern tip of the island. Twenty-two deer were transferred from the Taipei Zoo to serve as a founder population. Over the next 10 years the deer were maintained in enclosures until their eventual release into the National Park in 1994. Altogether over 200 deer have been released and the current population, now spread beyond the park borders, is estimated to exceed 1000 individuals.Â¢æ‰∏ÅÁ§æÈ†ÇÁîüÊÖãÈÅä Ê¢ÖËä±ÈπøË¶ãÂÆ¢  Âè∞ÁÅ£Áí∞Â¢ÉË≥áË®äÂçîÊúÉ-Áí∞Â¢ÉË≥áË®ä‰∏≠ÂøÉ.

VNSAs vary widely in their goals, size, and methods. They may include narcotics cartels, popular liberation movements, religious and ideological organizations, corporations (e.g. private military contractors), self-defence militia, and paramilitary groups established by state governments to further their interests. While some VNSAs oppose governments, others are allied to them. Some VNSAs are organized as paramilitary groups, adopting methods and structure similar to those of state armed forces. Others may be informally structured and use violence in other ways, such as kidnapping, using improvised explosive devices, or hacking into computer systems. Description MS-13 gang graffiti. Thomas, Kiser, and Casebeer asserted in 2005 that \\"VNSA play a prominent, often destabilizing role in nearly every humanitarian and political crisis faced by the international community\\". As a new type of actor in international relations, VNSAs represent a departure from the traditional Westphalian sovereignty system of states in two ways: by providing an alternative to state governance; and by challenging the state's monopoly of violence. Phil Williams stated in 2008 that in the 21st century, they \\"have become a pervasive challenge to nation-states\\".. Williams argues that VNSAs develop out of poor state governance but also contribute to the further undermining of governance by the state. He explains that when weak states are \\"unable to create or maintain the loyalty and allegiance of their populations\\", \\"individuals and groups typically revert to or develop alternative patterns of affiliation\\". This causes the family, tribe, clan or other group to become \\"the main reference points for political action, often in opposition to the state\\". According to Williams, globalization has \\"not only... challenged individual state capacity to manage economic affairs, it has also provided facilitators and force multipliers for VNSAs\\".. Transnational flows of arms, for example, are no longer under the exclusive surveillance of states. Globalization helps VNSAs develop transnational social capital and alliances as well as funding opportunities.. The term has been used in several papers published by the US military.  Types  Violent non-state actors engage in combat in all terrains. Common and influential types of VNSAs include: * Criminal organizations, Drug cartels, for example, may carry out assassinations, kidnappings, thefts, extortions; operate protection rackets; and defend their turf from rival groups and the military. * People's movements or sections of them that have chosen guerrilla tactics (also known as asymmetric warfare) to pursue their aims. An example is the Naxalite-Maoist insurgency in central India. *Pirates, outlaws that rob ships or take hostages in order to get a ransom. Recent examples include piracy off the coast of Somalia. Some pirates also state that they serve as \\"coastguards\\" in place of a failed state *Private military companies, and corporations that either have their own, or hire, private military services. An example is floating armouries in the Indian Ocean. Private military companies are also active in counter-piracy, and thus provide an example of violent non-state actors combating other violent non-state actors. *Violent non-state actors at sea. Both pirates and private military companies are also part of this group, along other less malicious actors, such as Neptune's Navy. * Religious or ideological groups, such as Boko Haram in and around Nigeria, that espouse armed violence as a moral or sacred duty. * Citizen militia, which may form to protect a locality from (or threaten it with) attack, such as the anti-balaka movement in the Central African Republic. * Paramilitary groups, which make use of military methods and structures to pursue their agenda, such as the now-decommissioned Provisional Irish Republican Army. * Warlords, who are leaders using armed violence to exercise military, economic, and political control over territory within a sovereign state. Warlords have a long history in Afghanistan, for example. Phil Williams, in an overview article, identifies five types of VNSAs:. * Warlords * Militias * Insurgencies * Terrorist organizations * Criminal organizations and gangs  Relationship to terrorism  There is no commonly accepted definition of \\"terrorism\\", and the term is frequently used as a political tactic to denounce opponents whose status as terrorists is disputed. An attempt at a global definition appears in the working draft of Comprehensive Convention Against International Terrorism, which defines terrorism as a type of act, rather than as a type of group. Specifically, \\"terrorism\\" in the draft refers to the threatened or actual intentional injury to others, and serious damage to property resulting in major economic loss: Since the definition encompasses the actions of some violent non-state actors (and of some state actors) and not others, disagreements remain and the treaty has yet to be agreed, . For example, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation has called for acts of terrorism to be distinguished from:  Use of children  Violent non-state actors have drawn international condemnation for relying heavily on children under the age of 18 as combatants, scouts, porters, spies, informants, and in other roles (although many state armed forces also recruit children). In 2017, for example, the United Nations identified 14 countries where children were widely used by armed groups: Afghanistan, Colombia, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Mali, Myanmar, Nigeria, The Philippines, Singapore, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Not all armed groups use children, and approximately 60 that used to do so have entered agreements to reduce or end the practice since 1999. For example, by 2017 the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in the Philippines had released nearly 2,000 children from its ranks, and the FARC-EP guerilla movement in Colombia agreed in 2016 to stop recruiting children. In other situations, the use of children was increasing in 2017, particularly in Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria and Syria, where Islamist militants and groups opposing them intensified efforts to recruit children. Humanitarian engagement Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute propose that engagement with VNSAs, which they call armed non-state actors, is essential to humanitarian efforts in conflicts. They claim that it is often necessary to do so to facilitate access to those affected and to provide humanitarian assistance. However, humanitarian agencies often fail to engage strategically with VNSAs. This tendency has strengthened since the end of the Cold War, partly because of the strong discouragement of humanitarian engagement with VNSAs in counterterrorism legislation and donor funding restrictions. In their opinion, further study is necessary to identify ways in which humanitarian agencies can develop productive dialogue with VNSAs. The International Security Department and the International Law Programme at Chatham House are seeking to understand the dynamics that will determine support for a principle-based approach to engagement by humanitarian actors with VNSAs.

It is almost entirely instrumental. It was the direct followup to Vollenweider's breakthrough album, Behind the Gardens. The album opens with the sound of a man and woman walking and talking in an unknown language (some of the words - notably in Spanish - can be discerned when the track is played backwards) and then stumbling into an echoing cave and reacting with awe. The sound of dripping water in the cave turns into the rhythm of the music that fades in at this point. While the album originally stood on its own, in 1990 it and the preceding and subsequent albums (Behind the Gardens - Behind the Wall - Under the Tree and White Winds) were re- released as a two-CD set entitled \\"Trilogy,\\" suggesting they collectively constituted a single musical entity. The full titles of the first two albums lend credence to the suggestion that the three albums are thematically connected. The full title of the first album is \\"Behind the Gardens‚ÄîBehind the Wall‚ÄîUnder the Tree...\\" The ellipsis at the end suggests a continuation. The full title of the next album is \\"Caverna Magica (...Under the Tree‚ÄîIn the Cave...)\\" The first ellipsis, followed by the repetition of \\"Under the Tree\\" from the first album title, clearly indicates a continuation. The second ellipsis suggests another continuation, which would turn out to be \\"White Winds (Seeker's Journey).\\" The last track on the White Winds album is entitled \\"Trilogy (At The White Magic Gardens) & The White Winds\\". The title of the first album \\"is like giving someone directions: \\"You will find us behind The Garden, behind The Wall, under The Tree...\\", Vollenweider is quoted as saying on his official web site, https://web.archive.org/web/20051105034423/http://www.vollenweider.com/.Behind the Gardens The title of the second album apparently indicates a continuation of those directions: Under the tree you'll find a magic cavern. This magic cavern could be a metaphor for the recording site. This is borne out by the rest of the Vollenweider quote: \\"Recording this album we worked completely cut off from the world, in the cellars of the Sinus Studios in Bern (capital of Vollenweider's native Switzerland), which are more than 300 years old. In the shelter of this creative \\"womb\\", it was easy to lose track of time and space.\\" Sinus, where all three albums were recorded, \\"was a small, underground studio,\\" stated an article in the April 2003 edition of Mojo magazine, quoted at https://web.archive.org/web/20070128001659/http://www.higgs1.demon.co.uk/barritt/mojo.htm. \\"It was entered by wooden shutters in the pavement above, which gave the impression of entering a crypt.\\" The names of some tracks on the album (\\"Mandragora,\\" \\"Belladonna,\\" and \\"Geastrum Coronatum\\") refer to plants and fungi that have medicinal, poisonous and hallucinogenic properties (Mandragora, Atropa belladonna and Geastrum coronatum, respectively). They are also the sort of plants one might associate with Sinus Studios, which by Vollenweider's time there already was associated with the Swiss psychedelia scene and Swiss rock. In 1972 it had been the recording site of the album \\"Seven Up,\\" a collaboration between space rock band Ash Ra Tempel and drug- culture figure Timothy Leary.The Making of Seven Up Any relationship between Caverna Magica track titles and Sinus Studios' history could be entirely coincidental. Vollenweider's official site quotes him as saying the album \\"was truly like an expedition into the deep realm of this music. The comparison with cave explorers perfectly describes our experience: beyond every corner, in every new corridor, we found unknown spaces. For us, it was as if nobody before us had ever set foot in this territory - an indescribable feeling!\\" Reception  Track listing  All music by Andreas Vollenweider.

Background Mac Diarmida was bred by John Hartigan at his Cashel Stud farm in Ocala, Florida. Sired by Minnesota Mac, he was out of the mare Flying Tammie, a daughter of the 1958 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner, Tim Tam. As a weanling, John Hartigan sold Mac Diarmida in a private transaction to Dr. Jerome Torsney, who entrusted his race conditioning to future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Scotty Schulhofer. Racing career Mac Diarmida made two starts at age two without a win. However, at age three he had a Championship year, winning twelve of his fourteen starts including ten in a row on grass surfaces. Ridden by Jean Cruguet, among Mac Diarmida's 1978 wins, he beat older horses in capturing the two most important North American turf races with European competitors: the Canadian International Championship at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and the Washington, D.C. International at Laurel Park Racecourse in Laurel, Maryland. Mac Diarmida was voted the 1978 Eclipse Award for American Champion Male Turf Horse. Wintered in Florida, Mac Diarmida was being readied to race as a four-year-old when he injured himself and had to be retired from racing. Stud career He was sent to stand at stud at Cashel Stud in Ocala, Florida where he had been born. There, he served as a stallion for thirteen seasons before being pensioned.

Particularly praised for her performances in the repertoire of George Frideric Handel, Abrams enjoyed a successful concert career in London during the 1780s. Music historian Charles Burney praised the sweetness of her voice and her tasteful musical interpretations.Olive Baldwin, Thelma Wilson: \\"Harriett Abrams\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed 18 February 2009), (subscription access) Biography John Braham with Harriet Abrams and her two daughters, Harriet and Theodosia Abrams by Richard Cosway Abrams was born into a large musical family of Jewish descent. Her younger sister Theodosia Abrams Fisher (d Torquay, 4 November 1849) was a professional contralto and her youngest sister Eliza Abrams (d Torquay, 21 August 1831) was also a concert soprano and pianist. Other family relatives included Miss G. Abrams, who sang at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane with Harriett's for two seasons and sang in concerts in the early 1780s; Jane Abrams, who first sang in a benefit concert organized by Harriet in 1782; William Abrams, who played the violin; and Charles Abrams, who played the cello. The violinist Flora Abrams may have also been a relative but the connection is uncertain. Abrams studied singing, music theory, and composition with composer Thomas Arne before make her professional opera d√©but as the little gypsy in May-Day, or The Little Gipsy on 28 October 1775 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London. The opera was written specifically for her by librettist David Garrick and Arne who composed the music. Although possessing a fine voice, Abrams had little stage personality and spent most of her career as a concert performer. After five years performing at Drury Lane, Abrams became a principal singer at the fashionable London concerts and provincial festivals, appearing regularly from 1780-1790. She notably sang annually in the Handel Commemoration in Westminster Abbey in 1784 and annually in the Handel festivals from 1784-1787. She also sang at the opening of the Concerts of Ancient Music in 1776 and returned there frequently through 1790. Abrams also appeared in various concert series organized by John Ashley, Venanzio Rauzzini, and Johann Peter Salomon and often performed in concerts and recitals with her sister Theodosia. The Public Advertiser, while praising Harriett's work as a soloist, commented in 1783 that the \\"Forte of the Sisters ‚Ä¶ lives manifestly in Duettos\\". During the 1790s Harriet's public performances became infrequent and she mostly appeared in private concerts with both her sisters. She did, however, give annual benefit concerts open to the public in 1792, 1794 and 1795 which were accompanied by Joseph Haydn on the piano.Jewish Encyclopedia Abrams composed several songs, two of which, \\"The Orphan's Prayer\\" and \\"Crazy Jane\\", became very popular. She published two sets of Italian and English canzonets, a collection of Scottish songs and glees harmonized for two and three voices, and more than a dozen songs, mainly sentimental ballads. A collection of songs published in 1803 was dedicated by Harriett to Queen Charlotte.

Playing career After beginning his career on a two-year apprenticeship at Portsmouth, Burrows played for non-league clubs Cowes Sports, Christchurch, Brading Town, Eastleigh and West Moors. His playing career included appearances in the FA Cup, FA Vase and was part of the Eastleigh Social Club squad that played in the Carlsberg Pub Cup Final, held on 6 May 2000 at the old Wembley Stadium. Burrows is recognised as scoring the sport's fastest ever goal, beating both the former English record of Colin Cowperthwaite (3.5 seconds) and the world record held by Ricardo Oliveira (2.8 seconds). The record was set in a reserve team match against Eastleigh in 2004, when Burrows spotted the goalkeeper off his line and shot straight from kick-off. With the wind behind it the ball landed in the goal, and was recorded by the match referee at 2.5 seconds. The Football Association later confirmed this goal was a world record for the sport.

It was entered into the 1959 Cannes Film Festival. It stars Fredric March and Kim Novak. The screenplay was adapted by Paddy Chayefsky from his Broadway play of the same name. Plot A 24-year-old divorcee, Betty Preisser, a receptionist for a clothing manufacturer, takes some office work home which her boss, widower Jerry Kingsley, a man of 56, drops by to pick up. Professional rather than personal acquaintances, Betty tells Jerry of her loveless marriage to George, a musician. Jerry has a married daughter, Lillian, about her age, and a spinster sister, Evelyn, who is very protective of him. Jerry works up the nerve to invite Betty to dinner. He meets Betty's mother, Mrs. Mueller, and sister Alice, who share the apartment with Betty. Their relationship grows, but she professes to be reluctant to date her employer. Jerry wonders if their age difference is really behind this reluctance. Despite this, a May‚ÄìDecember relationship between them develops. Female family members of both of them strongly disapprove. Mrs. Mueller calls him a \\"dirty old man,\\" while Jerry's sister calls Betty a \\"fortune hunter\\" and him a fool, although Lillian's husband Jack offers his congratulations, earning scorn from his wife and causing them to quarrel. A colleague, Walter Lockman, trapped in a long and unhappy marriage, urges Jerry to do whatever it takes to find true happiness. George returns to town and tries to persuade Betty to return to him. In a moment of weakness, they have a romantic tryst. Betty regrets it and explains to Jerry that it meant nothing to her emotionally, but he feels humiliated. His sister observes how depressed Jerry has become when he returns home. At his lowest ebb, he learns that Walter has taken an overdose of pills in a likely suicide attempt. Jerry sees it as a sign to seize the joy in life while he still can. He returns to Betty. Cast TV play The story originally appeared as an episode of The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse.

See List of admirals of Croatia Early history At the time of Duke Branimir (879-892) a Croatian fleet participated in the battle against the Venetians, who were completely defeated on 18 September 887, and in which the Doge Pietro I Candiano was killed. Between 887 and 948, no new war was recorded between Venice and the Croats, which assumed that Venetians paid tribute to maintain the peace. In the work of Constantine Porphyrogenitus, De administrando imperio it is stated that Croatia, during the reign of King Tomislav had 80 sagenas (larger ships with 40 sailors) and 100 (smaller ships with 10 to 20 sailors, not counting oarsmen). The era of King Stjepan Dr≈æislav (969-996) was marked with successful maritime trade and safekeeping of maritime routes and domination of Croatia on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea.Navy history on Official pages of Croatian Armed Forces The King of Croatia and Dalmatia Petar Kre≈°imir IV (1058‚Äì1074) expanded its kingdom \\"on land and on sea\\". In his deed of donation to the convent of Saint Kr≈°evan in Zadar in 1069, it is stated that he donated the island of Maun, situated \\"in our Dalmatian sea\\" (in nostro dalmatico mari). The Duke of the Croatian Royal Navy, Rusin, is mentioned at the time and the fact that the very title of Duke could be borne only by governmental dignitaries is proof of the navy importance. In the first year of the rule of King Dmitar Zvonimir (1074‚Äì1089) Normans invaded the Adriatic Sea. As Normans ally, Dmitar Zvonimir joined in wars against Byzantium. When Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia, invaded the western Balkan provinces of the empire in 1084, Zvonimir sent his fleet to his aid. Normans conquered cities on the eastern coast. The only detail that is certain is that the island of Rab never fell. The alliance of Normans and Croats made under the influence of the Pope Gregory VII lasted from 1082 to 1084: they led together a series of naval battles against Byzantine-Venetian navy. During the period of personal union with Kingdom of Hungary, the Croatian coast fell under Venice and its naval power deteriorated. But this is the time when the fleet of the Republic of Dubrovnik, which kept its independence, started to rise.  Modern history   Napoleonic wars  Naval base at Pula Battle of Lissa The independence of Dubrovnik was also kept during Napoleonic wars which shows its strength and effective diplomacy. But the strength of the Republic of Ragusa was also manifested in its maritime power. The size of the Fleet of Dubrovnik in 1800, together with fishing ships, was 673 clippers. 255 of them were bigger ships that sailed outside the territorial waters of Dubrovnik. The total number of transatlantic clippers was 230 ships. The Republic had its consulates in over 80 cities. At that time, Dubrovnik had about 7,000 seamen, shipbuilders, shipowners and members of other maritime professions. The period from 1806 to 1813 was the era of the French rule of Marshal Marmont in Dalmatia and development of maritime trade. Napoleon's rule of Dalmatia was followed by Austro-Hungarian rule and on 2 November 1818 the first steam ship Carolina sailed the Adriatic Sea. In early 1838 the free steamship navigation in the Adriatic Sea with regular steamship route Triest-Mali Lo≈°inj-Zadar-≈†ibenik-Split-Hvar-Korƒçula-Dubrovnik-Kotor was proclaimed. This year was also marked with cessation of the domination of the clippers and entrance of steamship in the war fleet.  Austro-Hungary  Viribus Unitis Admiral Janko Vukoviƒá First Croatian flag ever hoisted on a naval ship, Pula, October 31st, 1918, with the crews saluting the flag. In June 1866, the Italian King Victor Emanuel II declared war on Austria (as they had many times before the Adriatic Sea was a battlefield). Both fleets fought on 20 September opening fierce artillery fire. Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, a commander of the Austrian fleet sails into the harbour of Vis with all gunboats. With victory in Battle of Lissa (Vis) Austria secured dominance on the Adriatic Sea. In 1866, a Croatian officer in the Austro-Hungarian Navy, Ivan Lupis, together with Robert Whitehead, constructed the first self- propelled torpedo in Rijeka. In 1869, the Austrian frigate undertook a trip around the world. Donau displaced 2000 tons and carried 350 crew members who were sailors from islands and coast of the Eastern Adriatic, mostly Croats. The ship left Pula in July and returned in March 1871 having sailed the whole Earth. There is a ship log written by a crewmember, Matija Politeo from Stari Grad on the island of Hvar. The period from 1911 to 1914 was especially important for the development of the Austro-Hungarian Navy in which most of the crew consisted of Croats. The biggest ships of Austro-Hungarian Navy were launched at that time: , , and . This is also the period in which we can find Croats as high-ranking officers, like admiral Maximilian Njegovan (Commander- in-Chief of the Navy, 1917‚Äì1918) or admiral Janko Vukoviƒá (commander of SMS Viribus Unitis). Post WWI After the end of World War I, in 1918 the Austro-Hungarian navy on the admiral ship SMS Viribus Unitis in Pula was forced, under order of the Emperor Charles I of Austria, to surrender to delegates of the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs from Zagreb - Ante Tresiƒá Paviƒçiƒá, Vilim Buk≈°eg and Ivan ƒåop and members of the Local National Council in Pula. The Croatian flag was flown then. On the very same day a specially designed Italian craft called mignatta (\\"leech\\"), similar to a guided torpedo, broke through the harbour of Pula and sank the battleship Viribus Unitis together with 250 sailors and Commander Janko Vukoviƒá. (see Raid on Pula) Yugoslavia The navy and merchant navy led by Croatian maritime experts continued to develop at the time of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and later in socialist Yugoslavia. During this period, many Croats took over high duties in Yugoslav Navy whose main bases were on the territory of Croatia. World War II Modern Croatia During the breakdown of Yugoslavia in 1991, by decree of the Croatian President on 12 September 1991, the new Croatian Navy was born. The first Navy commander appointed was admiral Sveto Letica. The first ship in the naval fleet was landing craft n¬∫ 103, but soon Croatia gained possession over 34 ex-ships of the Yugoslav navy, captured during the battle of ≈†ibenik. A flotilla of three naval trawlers and fishing boats was established in Kali, Ugljan island, under the operational command of the Croatian Army's 112th Brigade on 21 August 1991.Zdenko Vidov: Izgleda kao da je netko namjerno koƒçio stvaranje odreda Vidov: Borba za obranu domovine naglo pada u zaborav, by Sini≈°a Klarica, 12 September 2011 Members of this unit, manning a motorboat and a sailboat, disabled the Yugoslav Mirna-class patrol boat Biokovo with a Malyutka antitank missile fired from a cove at ≈†karda island on 10 September 1991, in one of the first naval actions of the war.Udruga Dragovoljaca Hrvastke Ratne Mornarice - Zadar The main fleet was established on 24 September, consisting of six ships. *List of Croatian warships (as of 24 September 1991)World Navies Today: Croatia **RTOP-402 - later **Tƒå-222 - later TB-51 Vukovar **Rƒå-301 - later OBM 41 Dubrovnik **Pƒå-171 - later OB-61 Novigrad **Pƒå-180 - later OB-63 Cavtat **Pƒå-181 - later OB-64 Hrvatska Kostajnica Two other warships captured by Croatia, the Osa I class Rƒå-310 Velimir ≈†korpik and the Shershen class Tƒå-219 Streljko were not regarded as seaworthy and were eventually sunk by the missile boats Kralj Petar Kre≈°imir IV and OBM-41 Dubrovnik in October 1994, during a live firing exercise known as Operation Posejdon.HRM \\"Vukovar\\" i \\"Dubrovnik\\" Vojna vjezba drill posjedon- Hrvatska Croatia, Jadran Adriatic 1994 Operation Posjedon video The main actions of the new Croatian navy during the war of independence were the lifting of the Yugoslav blockade of DalmatiaAdmiral Letica je naredio: \\"Raspali!\\" Slobodna Dalmacija, 15 November 2004. and the relief of Dubrovnik.Croatian international relations review (1997) Issues 6-13.

Considered by many to be the 'Father of Mexican Modernism', Ramos Mart√≠nez is best known for his serene and empathetic paintings of traditional Mexican people and scenes. As the renowned Nicaraguan poet Rub√©n Dar√≠o wrote, \\"Ramos Mart√≠nez is one of those who paints poems; he does not copy, he interprets; he understands how to express the sorrow of the fisherman and the melancholy of the village.‚Äù Maria Sodi de Ramos Mart√≠nez, ‚ÄúParis‚Äù Alfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez, translated by Berta de Lecuona, The Mart√≠nez Foundation, 1949. Early years 1880-1900 Ramos Mart√≠nez was born in 1871 in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, the ninth child of Jacobo Ramos and his wife Luisa Mart√≠nez.Maria Sodi de Ramos Mart√≠nez, ‚ÄúFirst Years‚Äù Alfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez, translated by Berta de Lecuona, The Mart√≠nez Foundation, 1949. His father was a successful merchant trading in jewelry, fine fabrics, silver, embroidered suits and hand- woven sarapes from Saltillo. All members of the Ramos Mart√≠nez family were involved with their father's business and it was expected that the artist, too, would one day join the ranks of ‚Äúhonorable merchant‚Äù. However, Ramos Mart√≠nez's evident talent and instincts propelled him towards a career in the arts; a choice that his family ultimately supported. At the age of nine, one of Ramos Mart√≠nez's drawings, a portrait of the governor of Monterrey was sent to an exhibition in San Antonio, Texas, and won first prize. A portion of that prize included a scholarship to study at the most prestigious art school in all of Mexico, the Academia Nacional de Bellas Artes (Academy of Fine Arts) in Mexico City.Jean Stern, ‚ÄúAlfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez‚Äù included in Alfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez, Louis Stern Galleries, October 1991. Thus the entire Ramos Mart√≠nez family relocated to Coyoac√°n, a small town on the outskirts of Mexico City. From an early age Ramos Mart√≠nez was recognized as prodigiously talented. As a student, his preferred medium was watercolor and he won numerous awards for his achievements. Though he found the teaching methods at the Academy repressive and counter-intuitive to his more emotional plein air impulses, Ramos Mart√≠nez created a significant body of work that he was able to sell while still a student.Brooke Waring, ‚ÄúMart√≠nez and Mexico's Renaissance‚Äù The North American Review Quarterly, Vol. 240, December 1935. Gratifying as his youthful accomplishments were, the news from France, and the examples of the brilliance of the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist artists, persuaded the young painter that he needed to be in Europe to continue his education and define his career. Though his family was by no means poor, they did not have funds to support Ramos Mart√≠nez's European dream. In a supreme bit of good fortune, Phoebe Hearst attended a dinner in Mexico City for the President of Mexico, Porfirio D√≠az, which featured place mats designed and painted by the young Ramos Mart√≠nez. Hearst was so impressed with the decoration that she asked to meet the artist and see other examples of his work. After their meeting, she not only bought all of Ramos Mart√≠nez's watercolors, but agreed to provide financial support for the artist's continued study in Paris.Margarita Nieto and Louis Stern, ‚ÄúMexico‚Äù, Alfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez & Modernismo, Alfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez Research Project, 2010. Paris 1901-1910 Ramos Mart√≠nez's arrival in Paris in 1900 coincided with further development of the Post-Impressionist movement. He was able to see firsthand the work of Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, Georges Seurat and Odilon Redon.George Raphael Small, Alfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez, His Life and Art, F & J Publishing Corp, 1975. Furthermore, Hearst's monthly stipend of 500 francs, combined with Ramos Mart√≠nez's fluent French, afforded him a comfortable lifestyle and the ability to travel throughout Europe. While in Paris, Ramos Mart√≠nez attended various artistic and literary salons and made the acquaintance of the modernist Nicaraguan poet, Rub√©n Dar√≠o. Dar√≠o and Ramos Mart√≠nez became close friends, thus insuring Ramos Mart√≠nez 's inclusion in a circle of rather extraordinary bon vivants such as Isadora Duncan, Paul Verlaine, Eleonora Duse, R√©my de Gourmont and Anna Pavlova. Dar√≠o wrote at length about the painterly and literary ideas that defined the creative output of both artists during those years. The two sojourned to Belgium and Holland to study the works of Rembrandt and Van Gogh. The artist's works from this period are strongly influenced by the somber tonalities of the Dutch sky and sea. Also, it was in Brittany, that Ramos Mart√≠nez began painting and drawing on newspapers, a material/medium he used to superb effect during his years in California. When the artist discovered he had run out of drawing paper, he asked the concierge at the inn where he was staying during a holiday weekend if he had any paper suitable for drawing. The gentleman offered him discarded newspapers in abundance. In 1905, Ramos Mart√≠nez began participating in the yearly Salon d'Automne in Paris, perhaps the most important of all the salons of that era.Margarita Nieto, ‚ÄúThe Game of Circumstance‚Äù, included in Alfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez, Louis Stern Galleries, October 1991. Within a year of his first showing there, his painting Le Printemps was awarded the Gold medal. However, after this great acknowledgment, Hearst decided she would no longer give him his monthly stipend and Ramos Mart√≠nez began the struggle of earning his living as an artist.Margarita Nieto and Louis Stern, ‚ÄúParis‚Äù, Alfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez & Modernismo, Alfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez Research Project, 2010. Ramos Mart√≠nez showed at a number of galleries in Paris. One of the leading art critics of the day, Camille Mauclair wrote that the work of Ramos Mart√≠nez was in the same class as the finest Impressionist landscapes exhibited in Paris. Though sales of his artwork were proceeding, and Ramos Mart√≠nez had achieved a degree of comfort as a ‚ÄòParisian‚Äô, in 1909 he felt a strong desire to return home to Mexico. Mexico 1910-1929 Portrait of Belinda Palavicini. 1915. Pastel on paper. 187 √ó 87 cm. Museo Nacional de Arte. By the time Ramos Mart√≠nez arrived in early 1910, Mexico was a nation in turmoil. The Mexican Revolution was beginning in earnest and the 30-year rule of President Porfirio D√≠az was on the verge of collapse due to the pressure of the political reforms of Francisco I. Madero. Within a year of the President's resignation in 1911, the art students at the National Academy called a strike in order to protest the 'aesthetic dictatorship' of the Academy. They demanded the establishment of a 'Free Academy' and proposed Ramos Mart√≠nez as director. Hailed as a distinguished alumnus, a bona fide European success, and sympathetic to the students‚Äô cause, Ramos Mart√≠nez became first the assistant Director and, by 1913, the Director of the Academy. Now, as Director, he was able to open the first of his Open Air Schools of Painting. With the example of the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists in mind and fortified by his sense of the primacy of the artist's personal vision, Ramos Mart√≠nez's Open Air Schools redefined the nature of artistic instruction in Mexico. The first school was established in the Santa Anita Iztapalapa borough of Mexico City with an initial class of 10 students, including David Alfaro Siqueiros and Federico Cant√∫, who would later become successful artists in their own right. By 1914, Ramos Mart√≠nez stepped down as Director of the Academy but opened another Open Air School in Coyoac√°n. That same year, his students' work was featured in the \\"Exhibition of Works from Public and Art Schools\\" at the Spanish Pavilion and met with extremely favorable response. The political situation in Mexico remained extremely volatile for the next decade and by 1920 Ramos Mart√≠nez was reinstated as Director of the Academy. Despite all the politics, the Open Air Schools flourished and Ramos Mart√≠nez was acknowledged as a true innovator in the Mexican art world and frequently called the 'Father of Modern Mexican Art'. To quote Ram√≥n Alva de la Canal in ‚ÄúLos acaparadores de murales‚Äù, \\"...the true force behind contemporary Mexican painting wasn't Diego Rivera; it was Alfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez.\\" While Ramos Mart√≠nez invested most of his energy in teaching and the establishment of his Open Air Schools, he also continued his own work as a painter. In 1923, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold by King Albert I of Belgium in recognition of his contributions to the visual arts.Virginia Stewart, ‚ÄúAlfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez‚Äù, 45 Contemporary Mexican Artists, Stanford University Press, 1951. In 1928, Ramos Mart√≠nez married Maria de Sodi Romero of Oaxaca. Their daughter, Maria was born one year later, suffering from a crippling bone disease. Ramos Mart√≠nez resigned as Director of the Academy and sought treatment for his daughter's condition. The family first traveled to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and eventually settled in the milder climate of Los Angeles, with Maria under the care of Dr. John A. Wilson. California 1930-1946 Having relocated to Los Angeles in 1929, Ramos Mart√≠nez was offered an exhibition by William Alanson Bryan, Director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) at Exposition Park. A number of subsequent exhibitions followed, with Mart√≠nez developing a strong following in the Hollywood community. Warner Brothers art director and interior decorator to the stars Harold Grieve acquired a number of works by the artist and championed the artist's work to his clients. Noted film directors Ernst Lubitsch and Alfred Hitchcock, costume designer Edith Head, screenwriter Jo Swerling, and actors Charles Laughton, Gary Cooper, James Stewart, and Beulah Bondi, among others, were collectors. Ramos Mart√≠nez was also exhibited with great success in San Diego at the Fine Arts Gallery of Balboa Park and in San Francisco at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor. It was there that celebrated Bay Area art patron Albert M. Bender first saw Ramos Mart√≠nez's work. Bender became a lifelong friend of the artist and acquired numerous works for his personal collection. Furthermore, he purchased and donated Ramos Mart√≠nez works to several San Francisco institutions, including the Legion of Honor, the San Francisco Museum of Art, the California Historical Society, and Mills College. In addition to his mastery of all conventional media including drawing, printmaking, watercolor, and easel painting, Ramos Mart√≠nez was an extremely skilled muralist who excelled in the technically challenging art of traditional fresco painting. Though a number of his murals were destroyed, including those at the Chapman Park Hotel in Los Angeles (adjacent to the famous Brown Derby Restaurant) and the Normal School for Teachers (Escuela Normal) in Mexico City, several important examples have survived. These include the Chapel of the Santa Barbara Cemetery (1934); the La Avenida Caf√©, Coronado, California (1938) (later restored and moved to the Coronado Public Library); and the unfinished fresco project, The Flower Vendors in the Margaret Fowler Garden at Scripps College, Claremont, California (1945). The Scripps mural was commissioned by the College at the urging of Millard Sheets, the much loved California artist and long-time admirer of Ramos Mart√≠nez. Another fresco, one of Ramos Mart√≠nez' most significant works, the La Guelaguetza, which was named after the ancient Oaxacan celebration of the Earth's abundance, was commissioned in 1933 by screenwriter Jo Swerling for his Beverly Hills home. Having fallen into obscurity for many years it was rescued before demolition of the residence in 1990. Alfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez died unexpectedly at the age of 73 on November 8, 1946, in Los Angeles. He was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. At the time of his death, Ramos Mart√≠nez was working on a series of murals entitled \\"The Flower Vendors\\" at Scripps College.Daily ArtFixx, \\"Cinco de Mayo - A.R.

Maria Sodi de Ramos Mart√≠nez, the artist's widow, saw to it that Ramos Mart√≠nez was included in numerous gallery exhibitions. Until her death in 1985, she was the primary champion of her late husband's work. In 1991, Louis Stern presented the first major retrospective of the artist's work since his death. The exhibition, \\"Alfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez (1872‚Äì1946),\\" was on view at Louis Stern Galleries in Beverly Hills from October 1, 1991, through January 6, 1992. This exhibition was the foundation of the monumental Ramos Mart√≠nez exhibition, \\"Alfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez (1871‚Äì1946), Une Visi√≥n Retrospectiva,\\" at Mexico City's renowned Museo Nacional de Arte (MUNAL) in April 1992. These two exhibitions became the cornerstones of a re-examination of Ramos Mart√≠nez's work and subsequent development of a secondary market for these works. As with the other major Mexican modernists, indigenous peoples were the principal subjects in the mature works of Ramos Mart√≠nez. In recent years, several of these paintings have realized high prices on the international art market. His 1938 painting Flowers of Mexico brought over $4 million at Christie's, New York in May 2007. The Alfredo Ramos Martinez Research Project Louis Stern Fine Arts began a public association with Mexican modernist Alfredo Ramos Martinez in 1991 with a retrospective exhibition of works by the artist, who lived in Los Angeles from 1929 until his death, in 1946. In collaboration with his daughter, Maria Martinez Bolster, and art historian Margarita Nieto, the gallery subsequently established the Alfredo Ramos Martinez Research Project to ‚Äúprotect the artist‚Äôs legacy and to advance the understanding and appreciation of the artist whom many have deemed the father of Mexican Modern Art.‚Äù The Research Project published a monograph, Alfredo Ramos Martinez & Modernismo, by Margarita Nieto and Louis Stern in 2009, and is currently compiling a catalogue raisonn√© of the artist's paintings and frescos.Alfredo Ramos Martinez http://www.alfredoramosmartinez.com/ See also *Mexican muralism *Mexican art *Rosario Cabrera References External links *Alfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez Research Project and Catalogue Raisonne *Spanish Language Biography Category:Mexican muralists Category:Mexican portrait painters Category:Modern painters Category:1871 births Category:1946 deaths Category:19th-century Mexican painters Category:19th-century male artists Category:Mexican male painters Category:20th-century Mexican painters Category:20th-century male artists ","title":"Alfredo Ramos Mart√≠nez"},{"id":"21538324","text":"Bevolo Gas and Electric Lights is the oldest and largest manufacturer of handmade, hand-riveted copper lanterns in the United States.New Orleans-based Bevolo Gas and Electric Lights expands its light fixture business worldwide ‚Äò‚ÄôNew Orleans City Business‚Äô‚Äô via NewsLibrary.com ‚ÄúA tiny French Quarter shop is at the forefront of worldwide demand for authentic gas light fixtures.

Nothing is known of his life or the time when he lived. He is generally called \\"Protospatharius\\", which seems to have been originally a military title given to the colonel of the bodyguards of the emperor of Constantinople (Spatharioi); but which afterwards became also a high court title, or was associated with the government of provinces and the functions of a judge. It is conjectured that he lived in the 7th century; that he was the tutor to Stephanus Atheniensis; that he arrived at high professional and political rank; and that at last he embraced the monastic life. All this is, however, quite uncertain; and with respect to his date, it has been supposed that some of the words which he uses belong to a later period than the seventh century; so that he may possibly be the same person who is addressed by the title \\"Protospatharius \\" by Photius,Photius, Epist. 123, 193, pp. 164, 292, in the ninth. He appears to have embraced in some degree the Peripatetic philosophy; but he was certainly a Christian, and expresses himself on all possible occasions like a man of great piety: in his physiological work especially he everywhere points out with admiration the wisdom, power, and goodness of God as displayed in the formation of the human body. Five works are attributed to him: * , De Corporis Humani Fabrica. The longest of his works, and is an anatomical and physiological treatise in five books. It contains very little original matter, as it is almost entirely abridged from Galen's great work, \\"De Usu Partium Corporis Humani,\\" from which however Theophilus now and then differs, and which he sometimes appears to have misunderstood. In the fifth book he has inserted large extracts from Hippocrates' \\"De Genitura,\\" and \\"De Natura Pueri.\\" He recommends in several places the dissection of animals, but he does not appear ever to have examined a human body: in one passage he advises the student to dissect an ape, or else a bear, or, if neither of these animals can be procured, to take whatever he can get, \\"but by all means,\\" he adds, \\"let him dissect something.\\"Theophilus, De Corporis Humani Fabrica, v. 11\\\\. ¬ß3. * A treatise (Peri ouron), De Urinis, which, in like manner, contains little or nothing that is original, but is a good compendium of what was known on the subject by the ancients, and was highly esteemed in the Middle Ages, serving as a source of Gilles de Corbeil's poem De Urinis. * A short treatise , De Excrementis Alvinis * A Commentary on the \\"Aphorisms\\" of Hippocrates, which is sometimes attributed to a person named Philotheus: ** Philothei medici praestantissimi commentaria in aphorismos Hippocratis nunc primum e graeco in latinum sermonem conversa, first Latin translation by Luigi Corado (?), from Mantoua, 1581 : Google digitization ; Medic@ digitization. * A short treatise , De Pulsibus.

Mexico City, Sept. 26, 1899 ‚Äì d. Mexico City, March 5, 1992) was a Spanish-Mexican painter whose heavily European style was not appreciated by his contemporaries of the Mexican muralism movement, but he had influence with the succeeding Generaci√≥n de la Ruptura artists. He trained and began his art career in Europe moving later to Mexico City. He became a professor and researcher at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas training younger artists such as Rodolfo Nieto, Pedro Coronel, Carlos Olachea and Juan Soriano. As a teacher, he did not stop drawing but he did not paint professionally again until after retirement, having a number of exhibitions later in life. Life Balmori Picazo was born in Mexico City on September 26, 1899 to Ram√≥n Balmori Galguerra from Asturias, Spain and Everarda Picazo from Mexico. He spent his first four years of life in a community called Soberr√≥n near Llanes, Asturias with his mother, Everanda Picazo de Cuevas, dying in Spain. The family then moved to Mendoza, Argentina. They then moved by mule across the Andes to live in Santiago de Chile. When he was sixteen, Balmori‚Äôs father, Ram√≥n Balmori Galguera, committed suicide. He entered the Escuela de Bellas Artes de Santiago but his guardians did not want him to study art. In 1919, he went to Europe to study, starting at the Academy of San Fernando in Spain. His teachers in San Fernando included Jos√© Moreno Carbonero, Joaqu√≠n Sorolla and Julio Romero de Torres and studied with Salvador Dal√≠ and Remedios Varo. He was offered a chance to immigrate to Rome as a distinguished Spanish student but since the offer required that he renounce his Mexican citizenship, he declined. The Academy of San Fernando believed that the ideal was to reproduce reality without distortions but Balmori rebelled against this idea. For this reason, he gave up studies here for Paris at age twenty two. He lived for the next fourteen years in Paris, at first studying at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re under sculptor Antoine Bourdelle and learning about new movements in art. He struggled economically, but also met a number of famous artists, studying the work of Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani, Georges Braque and Matisse along with those of Italian Futurists and German Expressionists. He also had his first professional success as an artist. He studied transcendental meditation and because of health problems, spent time in Oran, North Africa. He favored the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War, which led to his detention in Spain. After he returned to Mexico, he continued this support, opening a school for children of Spanish exiles. Balmori Picazo was married three times, all to dancers. His first wife was French dancer, Marie Th√©r√®se B√©nard, who died shortly after from Addison's disease. His second wife was Rachel Bj√∂rnstrom, which whom he had a daughter, Kore Monica, who fell ill with polio. Rachel took the child to Sweden and never returned. His last marriage was to Helena Jord√°n Ju√°rez and lasted over forty years until his death. He died at age 93 in Mexico City on March 5, 1992 from heart and respiratory failure. Career Balmori Picazo began his career in Paris, where he met Juan Gris, Maurice de Vlaminck, Tsuguharu Foujita, Rabindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi, doing a portrait of Gandhi. He collaborated with Henri Barbusse on the weekly Monde, illustrating texts by writers such as Miguel de Unamuno, Maxim Gorki, Albert Einstein and Upton Sinclair. He also designed textiles, flyers and created engravings and paintings as well as posters against fascism, which earned him international awards. However, his anti-fascist activism along with collaboration with Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Unamuno and Le√≥n Felipe got him into trouble with the Spanish government. His first exhibitions were also in Europe, first at the Duncan Gallery in Paris. He traveled to Sweden for various successful exhibitions, then to Brussels and Madrid before he returned to Mexico, exhibiting in Mexico City. However, Mexico from the 1930s to 1950s was highly nationalistic with the painters from the Mexican muralism movement dominating, making Balmori‚Äôs more international style less appealing. He became a professor for about thirty years at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas and was also the head of the Academia de la Danza Mexicana with Miguel Covarrubias. During this time (1950s) he actively promoted new dance movements in Mexico, including the production of posters, wardrobes and librettos. His art students included Rodolfo Nieto, Pedro Coronel, Carlos Olachea and Juan Soriano. He was also an important fine arts researcher and writer, publishing articles books and essays on the topic as well as poetry. Two books, Aurea Mesura and T√©cnica de la expression pl√°stica, were published by UNAM. In his later career, he taught drawing, painting and composition at La Esmeralda and at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas, both in Mexico City.In 1973, he held an exhibition called \\"Espacios y tensiones\\" at the Museo Tecnol√≥gico de la Comisi√≥n Federal de Electricidad. This consisted of a series of paintings that demonstrated yet new ideas in his artistic conceptions. This and the later \\"Lunar Route\\" exhibitions were among his most important shows. Although he never stopped drawing, he returned to painting professionally after he retired from teaching at age seventy, exhibiting several times. His drawings include those of dancers such as Raquel Gutierrez, Rosa Reina and his wife Helena, as well as sketches of the Ballet Antigona which was headed by Jos√© Lim√≥n. His work can be found at the Museo de Arte Moderno in Toluca, the Museo de Universitario de Artes y Ciencias at UNAM, the Museo de la Estampa, the Museo de Arte Moderno in Madrid, the National Gallery in Prague and the Museum of Fine Arts of Asturias . When he was ninety, the Palacio de Bellas Artes held a homage for him along with the Museum of Fine Arts of Asturias in Oviedo, Spain, both with large retrospectives of his work. Other retrospectives of his work have been held after his death such as the 1996 event at the Casa Lamm Cultural Center in Mexico City and the Mexican Cultural Center in Paris in 1998. Artistry Balmori‚Äôs painting varied among the various painting styles of Europe of the 20th century as well as influence from Mexican muralism. While studying in Madrid, observing copies of Greek, Roman and Egyptian statues, he declared that beyond all forms there is a universe of light and shadow, whose mysteries, he stated, were for painters to discover. His portraits of Gandhi show academic and classical influence with some distortion of form and geometric shapes showing influence from Cubism and Picasso. Influence from Mexican muralism can be seen in realistic images and figurativism. Balmori was not influential directly in Mexican art as when he returned to Mexico in the 1930s, his European influence work was not popular. His work was not recognized by his contemporaries, with the exception of Carlos M√©rida, but did have influence on the following Generaci√≥n de la Ruptura.

Exhibition of B√©jar's works at the Museum of Light, Mexico City. Feliciano B√©jar Ru√≠z (1920 ‚Äì February 1, 2007) was a Mexican artist and artisan, best known for a style of sculpture called ‚Äúmagiscopios‚Äù which involved various materials along with crystals and/or lenses to play with light or create distorted visions. He was born in rural central Mexico and was completely self-taught as an artist. He was creative as a young child, drawing and creating his first sculpture like pieces from papier-m√¢ch√©. His art career began in New York, where he had travelled and lived for a time in Hell's Kitchen. His drawing the attention of Arthur Ewart and Frances Coleman, with the latter helping him have his first exhibition and whose husband helped sponsor his time in Europe. The magiscopes arose from an intense interest in light and the sun, which began when he saw a boy in Italy playing with reflections of the sun in puddles. Images of the sun appeared in his painting and sculpture, developing into the use of crystals and lenses. In his later life, B√©jar withdrew from the art world for about sixteen years, disillusioned with it and retreating to his ranch in the State of Mexico. He returned in 1998, with a retrospective of his work in Mexico City and continued to show his work until shortly before his death. Life Feliciano B√©jar Ru√≠z was born in 1920 in Jiquilpan, Michoac√°n, between the Sierra Madre Occidental and Lake Chapala, which was a very small and rural town when he was a child. He came from devout Catholic parents, who were not native to Jiquilpan, but instead arrived very poor there. For this reason, he and his family were considered to be outsiders. As a boy, B√©jar was an acolyte and wanted to become a priest. The Cristero War took a toll on him. Members of his family were abused and killed by the army during the conflict and his primary school was closed down by authorities. He was sent to middle school at the Colegio Salesiano de Artes y Oficios in Guadalajara, where he learned various trades such as carpentry and metalworking, but he was there only two years before the government shut that down too. After he return from Guadalajara, he worked with his father, who made a living selling notions, make up, perfume and other items on the street. He also worked as an assistant to a carpenter, sweeping out the shop in exchange for wood scraps. He used these to create toys and even large imaginary cities. When he was eight, he came down with polio, and had to use crutches until he was thirteen. Later in life, this affected his work, generally creating his pieces on the floor with one leg folded under for comfort. When he was fifteen, he began to teach himself art using various scrap materials. At this time muralist Jos√© Clemente Orozco was in his town to paint scenes of the Mexican Revolution on the town library. Orozco was aloof and although Bejar brought him some drawings to show, he did not want to see them. Later in life he stated that he did not think well of the muralists and considered them false and frauds. He said that their work was supposedly for the people but they could not be understood without interpretation and the main ones (Rivera, Siqueiros and Orozco) shut out other artists. B√©jar spent a number of his younger years traveling. When he was little, his grandmother Jesusa took him with her to other towns and even to Acapulco which let him know there was more out there. He came across a book called ‚ÄúAround the World‚Äù which impressed him, describing New York City in glowing terms. He saved the bus fare to travel there, but nothing more. When he got to New York in the 1940s, he was disappointed and thought it ugly. He wanted to return but had no money so he had to work menial jobs and live in Hell's Kitchen. During this time in New York, he was put in touch with English painter Arthur Ewart who encouraged him to get back to art, particularly painting. He also met socialite Frances Colman, while copying paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, who helped him get started selling his work. In 1947, he returned to Mexico. Coleman helped him have an exhibition in New York and in 1949, B√©jar traveled to Paris and bicycled through Europe to study the art in the museums there, sponsored by UNESCO and Coleman's husband. He returned again to Mexico in 1950. He returned again to Europe in 1956, where he painted and worked as a movie extra and radio announcer. In 1960, B√©jar met Englishman and historian Martin Foley, who had come to Mexico to study. They remained friends for over forty years and lived together at B√©jar's ranch until his death, with Foley writing B√©jar's biography. Foley never entered B√©jar's studio because he was concerned with stepping on something. Later in his life, B√©jar abandoned his hometown, stating it had become too large and too loud, losing much of its traditional architecture. He bought and developed a ranch in the municipality of Jilotepec, State of Mexico. His house there had flooding problems, with one major flood in 1981 severely damaging the house and gardens and destroying most of the artwork which it contained. However, he considered himself an artisan first, valuing his skills as a carpenter, metalworker and bricklayer, rebuilding the house and gardens himself. In the early 1990s, he withdrew from his art career, disillusioned by the art work, and in 1993, he was confined to a mental facility by his family involuntarily. Although he left the hospital some time later, a number of his family members still considered him crazy. B√©jar was considered to be an environmentalist. One reason for this was that in his early career, he had a sign in front of his house offering to take used materials for his art, and received much. It made him reflect on how much is wasted. His interest in ecology was also spurred by his time in Mexico City, when he lived for a while near Paseo de la Reforma, seeing how its trees and old mansions were deteriorating. From the 1990s to a few years before his death, B√©jar was withdrawn from the art world, secluding himself on his ranch and returning to his religious roots. His agricultural activities on his ranch kept him connected with his rural roots, creating artificial lakes, planting trees and crops and raising bees. He stated in an interview at that time that he was happier with his family at the ranch, which consisted of his companion Martin Foley, two Nahua women named Perfecta and Susana, whom he considered daughters, and an adopted son name Mart√≠n Feliciano B√©jar (born 1983). B√©jar died in Mexico City on February 1, 2007, of heart failure while in a hospital for tests. He was 86. He left behind about 100 unfinished pieces because of his system of working. He was buried at his ranch in the State of Mexico. Much of his finished and unfinished work is now in the hands of Martin Foley. Career Although B√©jar did painting, handcrafts and even trades, he is best known for his sculpture, especially a class of sculpture called ‚Äúmagiscopios.‚Äù These were created with metal, glass, crystal, plastic and resins, and feature crystals and lenses that distort the onlookers view. He created the first of these with waste metal and other scraps. After he created his first one, he invited Paco de al Maza, Justino Fern√°ndez, Salvador Novo and others for dinner. After seeing the work they thought about names with Jorge Hern√°ndez Campos coming up with ‚Äúmagiscopio.‚Äù When B√©jar exhibited these magiscopios at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in 1966, he signified a break for a generation of avant garde sculptors, and from traditional Mexican sculpture. It created the idea of art as a game, essentially a leisure activity. The magiscopios brought B√©jar fame and many of them were copied and reproduced; however, their popularity meant that no one wanted to see his paintings, which bothered him. The popularity also meant that he stopped making them from scraps, especially when he was hired as an artist-in-residence for Carburandum in the US, their first from Latin America. He signed a contract for five years which allowed him to work at their factory and work with larger pieces of materials. His last major completed work was a series of 120 magiscopios. B√©jar's art career began as a painter, and began in New York where he had his first individual exhibition of 18 paintings at the Ward Eggleston Gallery in 1948. However, this success did not open doors for him in Mexico when he returned, not being able to do so until he had the support of the Instituto Mexicano Norteamericano. This show brought his work to the favorable attention of Mexican art critics. However, over his lifetime he had over 150 individual exhibitions and his work appeared in about 100 collectives ones, both in Mexico and abroad. He had a sixteen-year break in exhibiting his work until 1998, when the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes sponsored a retrospective. They wanted to have it at the Palacio de Bellas Artes or the Museo de Arte Moderno, but B√©jar refused, stating that these avenues were too closed to new artists, so instead it was held at the Museo de Arte Carrillo Gil. His last exhibition was as the House of the First Print Shop in the Americas in Mexico City shortly before he died, and his last public work was a pair of colored shoes which were auctioned off for charity for 10,000 pesos. He received a number of awards but stopped accepting when the Bank of Mexico asked him to purchase the medal he was awarded because they lacked resources. He also became disenchanted with the attention given to him by politicians including Mexican presidents. He was a member of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana B√©jar was a prolific creator and while much of his production has been acquired for permanent collection, much is in the possession of his longtime friend Martin Foley. At least 75 of his works are part of major museum collections in Brazil, the United States, Great Britain and Israel. Since his death in 2007, there have been events to pay homage and exhibitions of his work, including a 2010 homage and conference at the Liberator Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla Cultural Center in his hometown in Michoac√°n and a major exhibition of his work at the Museum of Light in Mexico City in 2013. There have also been efforts to create a formal museum in B√©jar's memory. His former home in Michoac√°n has been opened to the public and contains a collections of his paintings, sculptures and handcrafts. Artistry While best known as a sculptor, he was also a painter, artisan and a tradesman, not seeing differences between artist and artisan, instead considering them inseparable. When he thought about his works, he always referred back to his creation of toys, and the fireworks castles his Uncle Jes√∫s created in Cotija and even continued drawing on cardboard as he did as a child. He worked with various techniques such as painting, drawing, engraving and sculpture in wood, ceramic, soldered metal, bronze, stone, stainless steel, crystal and plastic. He defined himself as a creator who did not belong to the artistic elite on Mexico. Although not considered part of the Generaci√≥n de la Ruptura, his work did open new avenues for artists in Mexico. He was noted for his use of geometry, transparency and light and was contrarian in various aspects. For example, he began to work in terracotta when many artisans were dismissing it in favor of porcelain. Some of his very first artistic works as a child involved paper mache and old wire, and the use of recycled materials characterize much of his early sculptural work. His early paintings generally had religious themes related to rural Mexico, something he returned to in his later life. He worked daily on one or more artistic project, with many in progress. He considered it a waste of time to write notes or create sketches. Some of his sculptures have taken twenty years to complete. The most noted element of his work is that of small suns, which developed in the use of crystals and lenses in his sculpture. The origin of this came from his time in Italy, when he saw a child capturing the reflections of the sun bouncing from puddles on the street. The sun images first appeared in his paintings, then moved onto his sculpture, where they evolved into the use of crystals and lenses to distort or sharpen the effect of light or the onlookers sight. These became the essence of many of his magiscopios. Martin Foley titled his autobiography of B√©jar El recolector de soles (The gatherer of suns.) . He stated that he wanted to ‚Äúdemocratize beauty through art‚Äù and believed art provided a way to live in harmony. He was also bothered by the idea that art was a solemn occupation, rather considering it a ‚Äúgame‚Äù however not light or frivolous. As he did not consider the arts and crafts separate, he is also noted for the making of rugs and tapestries. He also built houses, stage sets, a semi-circular Greco-Roman theaters and created a ranch to be close to nature, with gardens, water works and an orchard. His wide range of interests attracted some negative criticism for not specializing while others depreciated his work because of his frequent travels, calling him ‚Äúbohemian.‚Äù His art has also been classified as ‚Äúhandcraft‚Äù but that did not bother him, instead took pride in it.

Etymology Early scholars like Henry Hoyle Howorth believed that Porga was the son of one of five brothers of White Croats who had left White Croatia. They noted that the name was uncommon and probably not of Slavic origin. Slovak historian Pavel Jozef ≈†af√°rik compared the name to Purgas, which was the name of a Mordvins chief mentioned in 1229. Howorth considered that the Croats were subject to \\"alien princes, perhaps of Avar descent\\". Franjo Raƒçki considered that Porga could have been a foreign transcription of the Slavic name Borko.Franjo Raƒçki, Documenta historiae Croaticae periodum antiaquam illustrantia, p. 291 Vladimir Ma≈æuraniƒá noted that it was a genuine personal name which was attested in medieval Kingdom of Croatia at least since 12th as well Banate and Kingdom of Bosnia since 13th century in the form of Porug (Porugh de genere Boiƒá, nobilis de Tetachich near terrae Mogorovich), Poruga, Porƒça, Purƒáa / Purƒça, and Purƒëa (vir nobilis nomine Purthio quondam Streimiri). Recently, Serbian historian Tibor ≈Ωivkoviƒá argued that the name comes from the Iranian phrase pouru-g√¢o, translated as \\"rich in cattle\\". Croatian historian and archaeologist Ante Milo≈°eviƒá proposed a new thesis, that the differences in names in chapters 30 and 31 of De Administrando Imperio are due to differences in the folk tradition. According to Milo≈°eviƒá, chapter 30 resembles the tradition of the Longobards, whose first legendary rulers ‚Äì Godin, Peron, and Klafon ‚Äì were not actual historical figures, but deities equivalent to Norse Odin and Balto-Slavic Perun. In chapter 30, Porin ‚Äì like Longobard Peron, although probably intended as Porga ‚Äì wasn't an actual ruler name, but the Slavic deity Perun. Hence, Porin and Porga were two different variants of the deity Perun, and not one or two names of separate historical rulers. The thesis was subsequently supported by Denis J. Alimov, who noted that the name of 13th-century Mordvin chief Purgas derives from the deity of thunder Purgin, as well in the 10th-century Kievan Rus Perun became the supreme deity associated with the ruler. History De Administrando Imperio According to Constantine VII (r. 913 to 959) in De Administrando Imperio Porga was baptized during the reign of Emperor Heraclius (r. 610‚Äì641) Chapter 31, 1.4, says, \\"These same Croats had the father of Œ†ŒøœÅŒ≥Œ± (Porga) for their archon at that time\\", and, 1.5, \\"The Emperor Heraclius ordered and brought priests from Rome, and made of them an archbishop and a bishop and presbyters and deacons, and baptized the Croats; at that time these Croats had Porga for their archon.\\" However, the baptism had little impact as the White Croats were eventually baptized again, this time by Rome, after they had defeated the Avars in 677 and had already settled in the province of Dalmatia throwing off the Frankish authority. The conquest was led by five brothers: Kloukas (ŒöŒªŒøœÖŒ∫Œ±œÇ), Lobelos (ŒõœåŒ≤ŒµŒªŒøœÇ), Kosentzis (ŒöŒøœÉŒ≠ŒΩœÑŒ∂Œ∑œÇ), Mouchlo (ŒúŒøœÖœáŒªœé), Chrobatos (ŒßœÅœâŒ≤Œ¨œÑŒøœÇ), and two sisters Touga (Œ§ŒøœÖŒ≥Œ¨) and Bouga (ŒíŒøœÖŒ≥Œ¨). The 30th chapter, 2.10, says, \\"From that time they remained independent and autonomous, and they requested holy baptism from Rome, so bishops were sent to baptize them in the time of their archon Œ†ŒøœÅŒØŒΩŒøœÖ (Porinou)\\". Dates ≈Ωivkoviƒá pointed out that Porga could not be Borna (r. 810‚Äì821) or Branimir (879‚Äì892), with whom the older generation of scholars have tried to identify him. The change of noble personal names, which shifted from Iranian (or another language of different origin) to Slavic, simply could not have happened in a mere few generations. As such, the time of the White Croat conquest of the Avars is estimated to be during the 7th, and not 9th, century. Missing the chronology, the early scholar Henry Hoyle Howorth believed that Porga was the son of one of the five brothers mentioned in chapter 30 who had left White Croatia. Working on that assumption, Croatian historian Ivo Omrƒçanin believed that Porga would have ruled in ca. 660‚Äì680, while his father would have ruled ca. 635‚Äì660. Serbian historian Tibor ≈Ωivkoviƒá noted therefore that since the earliest possible date of Croat arrival would have been ca. 630, the baptism had to be before 638, while Heraclius was still on good terms with the pope. However, that would mean that the Croats had two archons at the time of Heraclius, and would rule for six or seven years, which is unlikely. ≈Ωivkoviƒá, based on De Administrando Imperio, thinks that the Croats' baptism is connected to Constans II (r. 641‚Äì668), as the event that distinguishes the father of Porga (Heraclius I) from Porga (Heraclius Constantine).

He performed as the member of several groups (mostly known for his time with Chac Mool ) and collaborations (most notably with Steve Roach as well as Suso Saiz) and as a solo artist. The Mexican Reyes should not be confused with the Cuban bassist Jorge Reyes, the Cuban author Jorge Ivan Reyes, the Brooklyn television writer Jorge A. Reyes, or the Oregon baseball player Jorge Reyes. History Reyes was born on September 24, 1952, in Uruapan, Michoac√°n, Mexico with the name Jorge Reyes Valencia.http://www.discogs.com/artist/14111-Jorge-Reyes He was not a Native Mexican, but played many Prehispanic instruments to which he was exposed from an early age in his village. Reyes attended the National School of Music, Mexico (Escuela Nacional de Musica de la Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico, or UNAM) 1970‚Äì1975, studying the flute. During this time, he formed two seminal Mexican rock bands, Al Universo and Nuevo M√©xico, influenced by Jethro Tull and Pink Floyd but incorporating native musical instruments. In 1976, his growing interest in jazz led to spending a year in Hamburg, Germany, where he studied improvisation with Herb Geller. As part of this training, he traveled through Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Sri Lanka. In 1978, he attended a Hindu music course in the Himalayas,Interview by Francisco Otegui, reprinted in Eurock in which he studied traditional Indian flute and percussion techniques. On these overseas trips, he began collecting many native instruments. After returning to Mexico, Reyes founded the band Chac Mool with drummer Armando Su√°rez and keyboardist Carlos Alvarado, which was one of the first Mexican progressive rock bands. The band recorded four well- received albums, on which Reyes played flute and guitar, before disbanding. In 1985, Reyes began a prolific solo career. He collaborated with several other new-age and electronic musicians, including American synthesist Steve Roach, Mexican singer and multi-instrumentalist Arturo Meza (of the band Decibel), Spanish guitarist Suso Saiz, Mexican percussionist Juan Carlos L√≥pez, German synthesist Elmar Schulte (of the band Solitaire), Deep Forest, and others. His music was used frequently in Mexican radio and television programs. He performed many concerts at famous Mexican archeological sites such as Malinalco, Teotihuacan, Templo Mayor, Chichen Itza, and Tenango del Valle. His annual D√≠a de los Muertos concerts at UNAM were popular events. He also gave many concerts at the Espacio Escult√≥rico de Ciudad Universitaria, where he collaborated with dancer and choreographer Regina Quintero.

The landscape and house architecture of the area remains remarkably intact and provide valuable information about the range of innovative planning principles that were applied there.Westchester: An American Suburb, Foreword, vii; Kenneth T.

Incorporating open space, recreational areas, naturalistic settings, and broad boulevards for public interaction.Samuel Swift, \\"Community Life at Rochelle Park\\", House & Garden (May 1904);page 235 The architecture of the homes is equally impressive, with many fashionable Queen Anne, shingle, and colonial revival style \\"cottages\\" designed with tall towers and attic porches to take advantage of the views towards Long Island Sound located a mile away.NRHP Registration, sec.9, p.8 Rochelle Park is essentially rectangular in dimension, with the southeast corner having been clipped from it by the construction of the New York & New Haven Railroad in the 1850s. In the original plan, the parcel was diagonally divided by a wide boulevard (\\"The Boulevard\\") that entered the park at a stone gateway and ended at a circle (\\"The Court\\"). The Boulevard was intended to continue east through a tunnel under the railroad tracks and south to Long Island Sound. This planned connection gave the park the cachet of water access even though the development was a good distance away.NRHP Registration, sec.7, p.2 This amenity lasted a very short time due to additional subdivisions of the property and the elimination of right-of-way.Rochelle Park‚ÄìRochelle Heights local historic district: design criteria guidelines, City of New Rochelle Department of Development (1998); page 11 Despite the setbacks from Barrett's original designs, The Boulevard continued to remain one of the most unusual aspects of the community's landscape. At 100 feet wide, The Boulevard allowed for an abundance of green space and deep setbacks for the houses. The scale and design of the Boulevard reflected Barrett's taste for formal landscape elements that anticipated the City Beautiful Movement.Title=\\"Nathan Franklin Barrett: Landscape Architect\\", Landscape Architecture, X3 (April 1920); Author=Richard Schermerhorn, Jr.;Pages. 112‚Äì113 The broad vista created by the Boulevard is intersected in two places by the Serpentine, a roadway that meanders within a rough, rocky section of the landscape. The terrain made a continuous grid plan difficult, thus presenting Barrett with an opportunity to design a more interesting landscape.Rochelle Park ‚Äì Rochelle Heights Historic District NRHP Nomination Form, Section 7 Page 3 Rochelle Heights The plan for Rochelle Heights is organized around a promontory in the northeastern part of the subdivision that was set aside for large houses with the status of water views. As the plan descended from this highpoint, a hierarchy of lots and architecture is shown in a secondary group encircling the hill. The properties at the outer limits of the development are more closely arranged in a tight pattern with detached houses intended for a middle-class clientele.NRHP Registration, sec.8, p.17Westchester, The American Suburb, Roger Panetta (2006); page 186 The latter properties provided a buffer against the more random development outside the district and protected the neighborhood's exclusive environment within. Rochelle Heights was laid out in a number of phases beginning in 1905 by New York architects Mann, MacNellie and Lindeberg. Its landscape design is more efficient than Rochelle Park, reflecting its later period of development. The architecture of Rochelle Heights does not have the same uniformity as Rochelle Park but rather, reflects the diversity of scale and style found in suburban architecture in the early twentieth century, including Queen Anne, shingle, tudor revival, and colonial revival. The planners laid out large expansive lots on the southerly side of Cortlandt Avenue where buyers would have views of Long Island Sound. Realizing this, naming the subdivision the \\"heights\\" had a certain legitimacy. Tudor Revival, Italian Renaissance and Colonial Revival designs were popular in this collection of homes which was viewed as the highest echelon of the development.NRHP Registration, sec.7, p.15 The streets at the outer boundaries of Rochelle Heights contain smaller lots. These streets frame the core of the development and buffer the interior properties. Although these tertiary streets were lesser properties in the context of the Rochelle Heights development, they were still above the mean and intended for a middle-class clientele.NRHP Registration, sec.7, p.16‚Äì17 These two neighborhoods, combined into one historic district in 1986, reflect the history of suburban design since 1885 when the phenomenon first took hold in the United States.Manual of historic house styles and materials: Rochelle Park‚ÄìRochelle Heights historic district, Stephen Tilly (2003); page 28 References Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Neighborhoods in New Rochelle, New York Category:Historic districts in Westchester County, New York Category:Planned communities in the United States Category:National Register of Historic Places in Westchester County, New York ","title":"Rochelle Park‚ÄìRochelle Heights Historic District"},{"id":"21538621","text":"Lists of animated feature films released in the 1980s organized by year of release: * List of animated feature films of 1980 * List of animated feature films of 1981 * List of animated feature films of 1982 * List of animated feature films of 1983 * List of animated feature films of 1984 * List of animated feature films of 1985 * List of animated feature films of 1986 * List of animated feature films of 1987 * List of animated feature films of 1988 * List of animated feature films of 1989 See also * List of highest-grossing animated films of the 1980s 1980s Animated ","title":"List of animated feature films of the 1980s"},{"id":"21538632","text":"Kayla Stra (born 3 December 1984) is a jockey and television personality in Thoroughbred horse racing who began racing in Australia, until coming to compete in the United States at racetracks in California. She currently rides once again in Australia, after riding in the Northern California circuit. This was after a 2-year riding stint in the Southern California area. Stra is also known for her appearances on the reality television show Jockeys on Animal Planet. Kayla Stra was born in Adelaide, South Australia, Australia, where she launched her career in horseracing prior to moving to California in late 2007. From a very young age, Stra was interested in horses, having talked her parents into buying her a pony when she was eight years old. During her late childhood and adolescence, Stra worked at racing stables and eventually bought her first horse‚Äîa Thoroughbred named Gurtie, which she trained on her own for picnic races (unregistered race horses) before getting her certificate in racing. Stra acknowledges her first trainer, Ray Moore, as someone who has had a strong racing influence in her life. Moore taught Stra how to be a horseman‚Äîhow to communicate with horses by reading their body language and having a keen feel for what they're thinking. Stra credits John Letts as one of her mentors for his outstanding jockey career, having won two Melbourne Cups and hundreds upon hundreds of stake races. As an apprentice, Stra was always in the top five riders and won all her premierships. During this time, she began traveling to different tracks to learn more from those experiences. Stra eventually racked up approximately 500 victories in her native country and became the \\"poster girl\\" for Australian horseracing. Now, she hopes to continue that success in the much larger US market. Racing in California, on 9 November 2007 Kayla Stra won her first American race aboard Flying Bearcat at Hollywood Park Racetrack. One notable victory was at Santa Anita on 49‚Äì1 longshot Paddin' Mud. In addition, Kayla scored an opening day victory at Del Mar with King Ledley, and then scored another victory aboard the same horse within three weeks. King Ledley is owned by Racing Capital Group, LLC, which is a race horse syndication company who primarily uses Kayla as their jockey. Racing Capital Group's web site is racingcapitalgroup.com., where she is their featured jockey. Stra's career goal to date is to hang in the game and not let the industry down. But here, she will face the toughest competitors in the world‚Äîserious professional athletes who are not likely to cut any slack for the new girl. Stra became a leading Adelaide apprentice jockey who posted 220 winners in Australia. Her biggest Australian win was in the 2005 City of Marion Stakes with gelding Navy Shaker. Stra was one of the jockeys featured in Animal Planet's 2009 reality television show, Jockeys. It lasted for two seasons. Stra returned to professional horse racing in January 2013, after the birth of her son, Brys Headley, in November 2012. Soon after her return to racing, a steward banned her from the Betfair Hollywood Park jockeys' room for breastfeeding her son. One of the stewards had allegedly told Stra's agent that she needed to decide whether she was going to focus on caring for her child or her profession. California Horse Racing Board chairman David Israel overruled the steward, stating \\"Kayla Stra's baby can be in the jocks' room. Her nanny can be with the baby. And both the mother and the nanny can do all the things they need to do.\\" Notes   External links  * http://www.equibase.com/profiles/Results.cfm?type=People&searchType;=J&eID;=128037 * Video profile of Kayla Stra at YouTube * Jockey Kayla Stra - Winning the Finale at Santa Anita aboard Paddlin Mud * Jockey Kayla Stra aboard Lucious Antonius, edging out Chantal Sutherland at Santa Anita * http://www.drf.com/news/santa-anita-notes-stra-wins-first-race-comeback * http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/09/kayla-stra_n_3568079.html Category:1984 births Category:American female jockeys Category:Australian emigrants to the United States Category:Australian female jockeys Category:Living people Category:Participants in American reality television series ","title":"Kayla Stra"},{"id":"21538638","text":"A date inscription in the alt=an inscription in Mayan characters The 2012 phenomenon was a range of eschatological beliefs that cataclysmic or transformative events would occur on or around 21 December 2012.Sources: * * * This date was regarded as the end-date of a 5,126-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, and festivities took place on 21 December 2012 to commemorate the event in the countries that were part of the Maya civilization (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador), with main events at Chich√©n Itz√° in Mexico and Tikal in Guatemala. Various astronomical alignments and numerological formulae were proposed for this date. A New Age interpretation held that the date marked the start of a period during which Earth and its inhabitants would undergo a positive physical or spiritual transformation, and that 21 December 2012 would mark the beginning of a new era. Others suggested that the date marked the end of the world or a similar catastrophe. Scenarios suggested for the end of the world included the arrival of the next solar maximum, an interaction between Earth and the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy, or Earth's collision with a mythical planet called Nibiru. Scholars from various disciplines quickly dismissed predictions of cataclysmic events as they arose. Mayan scholars stated that no classic Mayan accounts forecast impending doom, and the idea that the Long Count calendar ends in 2012 misrepresented Mayan history and culture.David Stuart, The Order of Days: The Maya World and the Truth about 2012, Harmony Books, 2011 Astronomers rejected the various proposed doomsday scenarios as pseudoscience which is easily refuted by elementary astronomical observations.  Mesoamerican Long Count calendar  December 2012 marked the conclusion of a b ºak ºtun‚Äîa time period in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, used in Central America prior to the arrival of Europeans. Although the Long Count was most likely invented by the Olmec, it has become closely associated with the Maya civilization, whose classic period lasted from 250 to 900 AD. The writing system of the classic Maya has been substantially deciphered, meaning that a corpus of their written and inscribed material has survived from before the European conquest. Unlike the 260-day tzolk ºin still used today among the Maya, the Long Count was linear rather than cyclical, and kept time roughly in units of 20: 20 days made a uinal, 18 uinals (360 days) made a tun, 20 tuns made a k ºatun, and 20 k ºatuns (144,000 days or roughly 394 years) made up a b ºak ºtun. Thus, the Maya date of 8.3.2.10.15 represents 8 b ºak ºtuns, 3 k ºatuns, 2 tuns, 10 uinals and 15 days.  Apocalypse  The oldest surviving manuscript of the alt=an ancient manuscript page. There is a strong tradition of \\"world ages\\" in Maya literature, but the record has been distorted, leaving several possibilities open to interpretation. According to the Popol Vuh, a compilation of the creation accounts of the K ºiche º Maya of the Colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fourth world. The Popol Vuh describes the gods first creating three failed worlds, followed by a successful fourth world in which humanity was placed. In the Maya Long Count, the previous world ended after 13 b ºak ºtuns, or roughly 5,125 years. The Long Count's \\"zero date\\" was set at a point in the past marking the end of the third world and the beginning of the current one, which corresponds to 11 August 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. This means that the fourth world reached the end of its 13th b ºak ºtun, or Maya date 13.0.0.0.0, on 21 December 2012. In 1957, Mayanist and astronomer Maud Worcester Makemson wrote that \\"the completion of a Great Period of 13 b ºak ºtuns would have been of the utmost significance to the Maya.\\" In 1966, Michael D. Coe wrote in The Maya that \\"there is a suggestion ... that Armageddon would overtake the degenerate peoples of the world and all creation on the final day of the 13th [b ºak ºtun]. Thus ... our present universe [would] be annihilated ... when the Great Cycle of the Long Count reaches completion.\\"  Objections  Coe's interpretation was repeated by other scholars through the early 1990s. In contrast, later researchers said that, while the end of the 13th b ºak ºtun would perhaps be a cause for celebration, it did not mark the end of the calendar. \\"There is nothing in the Maya or Aztec or ancient Mesoamerican prophecy to suggest that they prophesied a sudden or major change of any sort in 2012,\\" said Mayanist scholar Mark Van Stone. \\"The notion of a 'Great Cycle' coming to an end is completely a modern invention.\\" In 1990, Mayanist scholars Linda Schele and David Freidel argued that the Maya \\"did not conceive this to be the end of creation, as many have suggested\\". Susan Milbrath, curator of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the Florida Museum of Natural History, stated that, \\"We have no record or knowledge that [the Maya] would think the world would come to an end\\" in 2012. Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, said, \\"For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle,\\" and, \\"The 2012 phenomenon is a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in.\\" \\"There will be another cycle,\\" said E. Wyllys Andrews V, director of the Tulane University Middle American Research Institute. \\"We know the Maya thought there was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of another one after this.\\" Commenting on the new calendar found at Xult√∫n, one archaeologist said \\"The ancient Maya predicted the world would continue‚Äîthat 7,000 years from now, things would be exactly like this. We keep looking for endings. The Maya were looking for a guarantee that nothing would change. It's an entirely different mindset.\\" Several prominent individuals representing Maya of Guatemala decried the suggestion that the world would end with the 13th b ºak ºtun. Ricardo Cajas, president of the Colectivo de Organizaciones Ind√≠genas de Guatemala, said the date did not represent an end of humanity but that the new cycle \\"supposes changes in human consciousness\\". Mart√≠n Sacalxot, of the office of Guatemala's Human Rights Ombudsman (Procurador de los Derechos Humanos), said that the end of the calendar has nothing to do with the end of the world or the year 2012.  Prior associations  The European association of the Maya with eschatology dates back to the time of Christopher Columbus, who was compiling a work called Libro de las profec√≠as during the voyage in 1502 when he first heard about the \\"Maia\\" on Guanaja, an island off the north coast of Honduras.Hoopes 2011 Influenced by the writings of Bishop Pierre d'Ailly, Columbus believed that his discovery of \\"most distant\\" lands (and, by extension, the Maya themselves) was prophesied and would bring about the Apocalypse. End-times fears were widespread during the early years of the Spanish Conquest as the result of popular astrological predictions in Europe of a second Great Flood for the year 1524. In the 1900s, German scholar Ernst F√∂rstemann interpreted the last page of the Dresden Codex as a representation of the end of the world in a cataclysmic flood. He made reference to the destruction of the world and an apocalypse, though he made no reference to the 13th b ºak ºtun or 2012 and it was not clear that he was referring to a future event.F√∂rstemann 1906: 264 His ideas were repeated by archaeologist Sylvanus Morley,Morley 1915: 32 who directly paraphrased F√∂rstemann and added his own embellishments, writing, \\"Finally, on the last page of the manuscript, is depicted the Destruction of the World ... Here, indeed, is portrayed with a graphic touch the final all- engulfing cataclysm\\" in the form of a great flood. These comments were later repeated in Morley's book, The Ancient Maya, the first edition of which was published in 1946.  Maya references to b ºak ºtun 13  It is not certain what significance the classic Maya gave to the 13th b ºak ºtun. Most classic Maya inscriptions are strictly historical and do not make any prophetic declarations. Two items in the Maya classical corpus, however, do mention the end of the 13th b ºak ºtun: Tortuguero Monument 6 and La Corona Hieroglyphic Stairway 12.  Tortuguero  The Tortuguero site, which lies in southernmost Tabasco, Mexico, dates from the 7th century AD and consists of a series of inscriptions mostly in honor of the contemporary ruler Bahlam Ahau. One inscription, known as Tortuguero Monument 6, is the only inscription known to refer to b ºak ºtun 13 in any detail. It has been partially defaced; Sven Gronemeyer and Barbara MacLeod have given this translation: alt=Vase illustration in which the god Bolon Yukte is seen in profile, kneeling with his head back and his mouth open. He wears an elaborate feather headdress. Very little is known about the god B ºolon Yokte º. According to an article by Mayanists Markus Eberl and Christian Prager in British Anthropological Reports, his name is composed of the elements \\"nine\\",  ºOK-te º (the meaning of which is unknown), and \\"god\\". Confusion in classical period inscriptions suggests that the name was already ancient and unfamiliar to contemporary scribes. He also appears in inscriptions from Palenque, Usumacinta, and La Mar as a god of war, conflict, and the underworld. In one stele he is portrayed with a rope tied around his neck, and in another with an incense bag, together signifying a sacrifice to end a cycle of years. Based on observations of modern Maya rituals, Gronemeyer and MacLeod claim that the stela refers to a celebration in which a person portraying Bolon Yokte º K ºuh was wrapped in ceremonial garments and paraded around the site. They note that the association of Bolon Yokte º K ºuh with b ºak ºtun 13 appears to be so important on this inscription that it supersedes more typical celebrations such as \\"erection of stelae, scattering of incense\\" and so forth. Furthermore, they assert that this event was indeed planned for 2012 and not the 7th century. Mayanist scholar Stephen Houston contests this view by arguing that future dates on Maya inscriptions were simply meant to draw parallels with contemporary events, and that the words on the stela describe a contemporary rather than a future scene.  La Corona  In April‚ÄìMay 2012, a team of archaeologists unearthed a previously unknown inscription on a stairway at the La Corona site in Guatemala. The inscription, on what is known as Hieroglyphic Stairway 12, describes the establishment of a royal court in Calakmul in 635 AD, and compares the then-recent completion of 13 k ºatuns with the future completion of the 13th b ºak ºtun. It contains no speculation or prophecy as to what the scribes believed would happen at that time.  Dates beyond b ºak ºtun 13  Maya inscriptions occasionally mention predicted future events or commemorations that would occur on dates far beyond the completion of the 13th b ºak ºtun. Most of these are in the form of \\"distance dates\\"; Long Count dates together with an additional number, known as a Distance Number, which when added to them makes a future date. On the west panel at the Temple of Inscriptions in Palenque, a section of text projects forward to the 80th 52-year Calendar Round from the coronation of the ruler K ºinich Janaab º Pakal. Pakal's accession occurred on 9.9.2.4.8, equivalent to 27 July 615 AD in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The inscription begins with Pakal's birthdate of 9.8.9.13.0 (24 March, ) and then adds the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8 to it, arriving at a date of 21 October 4772 AD, more than 4,000 years after Pakal's time. Another example is Stela 1 at Coba which marks the date of creation as , or nineteen units above the b ºak ºtun. According to Linda Schele, these 13s represent \\"the starting point of a huge odometer of time\\", with each acting as a zero and resetting to 1 as the numbers increase. Thus this inscription anticipates the current universe lasting at least 2021√ó13√ó360 days, or roughly 2.687√ó1028 years; a time span equal to 2 quintillion times the age of the universe as determined by cosmologists. Others have suggested, however, that this date marks creation as having occurred after that time span. In 2012, researchers announced the discovery of a series of Maya astronomical tables in Xult√∫n, Guatemala which plot the movements of the Moon and other astronomical bodies over the course of 17 b ºak ºtuns. New Age beliefs Many assertions about the year 2012 form part of Mayanism, a non-codified collection of New Age beliefs about ancient Maya wisdom and spirituality.Sources:  The term is distinct from \\"Mayanist,\\" used to refer to an academic scholar of the Maya.Jenkins 2009: 223‚Äì229 Archaeoastronomer Anthony Aveni says that while the idea of \\"balancing the cosmos\\" was prominent in ancient Maya literature, the 2012 phenomenon did not draw from those traditions. Instead, it was bound up with American concepts such as the New Age movement, 2012 millenarianism, and the belief in secret knowledge from distant times and places. Themes found in 2012 literature included \\"suspicion towards mainstream Western culture\\", the idea of spiritual evolution, and the possibility of leading the world into the New Age by individual example or by a group's joined consciousness. The general intent of this literature was not to warn of impending doom but \\"to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism\\". Aveni, who has studied New Age and search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a \\"disconnected\\" society: \\"Unable to find spiritual answers to life's big questions within ourselves, we turn outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time‚Äîentities that just might be in possession of superior knowledge.\\"  Origins  In 1975, the ending of b ºak ºtun 13 became the subject of speculation by several New Age authors, who asserted it would correspond with a global \\"transformation of consciousness\\". In Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth Age of Consciousness, Frank Waters tied Coe's original date of 24 December 2011 to astrology and the prophecies of the Hopi, while both Jos√© Arg√ºelles (in The Transformative Vision) and Terence McKenna (in The Invisible Landscape) discussed the significance of the year 2012 without mentioning a specific day. Some research suggests that both Arg√ºelles and McKenna were heavily influenced in this regard by the Mayanism of American author William S. Burroughs II, who first portrayed the end of the Mayan Long Count as an apocalyptic shift of human consciousness in 1960's The Exterminator. In 1983, with the publication of Robert J. Sharer's revised table of date correlations in the 4th edition of Morley's The Ancient Maya, each became convinced that 21 December 2012 had significant meaning. By 1987, the year in which he organized the Harmonic Convergence event, Arguelles was using the date 21 December 2012 in The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology. He claimed that on 13 August 3113 BC the Earth began a passage through a \\"galactic synchronization beam\\" that emanated from the center of our galaxy, that it would pass through this beam during a period of 5200 tuns (Maya cycles of 360 days each), and that this beam would result in \\"total synchronization\\" and \\"galactic entrainment\\" of individuals \\"plugged into the Earth's electromagnetic battery\\" by 13.0.0.0.0 (21 December 2012). He believed that the Maya aligned their calendar to correspond to this phenomenon. Anthony Aveni has dismissed all of these ideas. In 2001, Robert Bast wrote the first online articles regarding the possibility of a doomsday in 2012. In 2006, author Daniel Pinchbeck popularized New Age concepts about this date in his book 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl, linking b ºak ºtun 13 to beliefs in crop circles, alien abduction, and personal revelations based on the use of hallucinogenic drugs and mediumship. Pinchbeck claims to discern a \\"growing realization that materialism and the rational, empirical worldview that comes with it has reached its expiration date ... [w]e're on the verge of transitioning to a dispensation of consciousness that's more intuitive, mystical and shamanic\\".  Galactic alignment  There is no significant astronomical event tied to the Long Count's start date. However, its supposed end date was tied to astronomical phenomena by esoteric, fringe, and New Age literature that placed great significance on astrology, especially astrological interpretations associated with the phenomenon of axial precession. Chief among these ideas is the astrological concept of a \\"galactic alignment\\". = Precession = In the Solar System, the planets and the Sun lie roughly within the same flat plane, known as the plane of the ecliptic. From our perspective on Earth, the ecliptic is the path taken by the Sun across the sky over the course of the year. The twelve constellations that line the ecliptic are known as the zodiacal constellations, and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called \\"precession\\", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a spinning top wobbles as it slows down. Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a Great Year, the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac. In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the March equinox, one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation Pisces moving back into Aquarius. This signaled the end of one astrological age (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the Age of Aquarius). Similarly, the Sun's December solstice position (in the northern hemisphere, the lowest point on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of Sagittarius, one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the Milky Way. Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from the surface of the Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10¬∞ and 20¬∞ wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it. In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the galactic equator. In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December. = Mysticism = Cygnus showing the lane of the Dark Rift, which the Maya called the Xibalba be or \\"Black Road\\"alt=a photograph of the Milky Way, rotated 90 degrees Mystical speculations about the precession of the equinoxes and the Sun's proximity to the center of the Milky Way appeared in Hamlet's Mill (1969) by Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Deschend. These were quoted and expanded upon by Terence and Dennis McKenna in The Invisible Landscape (1975). Adherents to the idea, following a theory first proposed by Munro Edmonson, alleged that the Maya based their calendar on observations of the Great Rift or Dark Rift, a band of dark dust clouds in the Milky Way, which, according to some scholars, the Maya called the Xibalba be or \\"Black Road\\". John Major Jenkins claims that the Maya were aware of where the ecliptic intersected the Black Road and gave this position in the sky a special significance in their cosmology. Jenkins said that precession would align the Sun precisely with the galactic equator at the 2012 winter solstice. Jenkins claimed that the classical Maya anticipated this conjunction and celebrated it as the harbinger of a profound spiritual transition for mankind. New Age proponents of the galactic alignment hypothesis argued that, just as astrology uses the positions of stars and planets to make claims of future events, the Maya plotted their calendars with the objective of preparing for significant world events. Jenkins attributed the insights of ancient Maya shamans about the galactic center to their use of psilocybin mushrooms, psychoactive toads, and other psychedelics. Jenkins also associated the Xibalba be with a \\"world tree\\", drawing on studies of contemporary (not ancient) Maya cosmology. = Criticism = Astronomers such as David Morrison argue that the galactic equator is an entirely arbitrary line and can never be precisely drawn, because it is impossible to determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above , an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to. Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence with the center of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998. There is no clear evidence that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod, Michael Grofe, Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni, have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided. There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or equinoxes. It is possible that only the earliest among Mesoamericans observed solstices, but this is also a disputed issue among Mayanists. There is also no evidence that the classic Maya attached any importance to the Milky Way; there is no glyph in their writing system to represent it, and no astronomical or chronological table tied to it.  Timewave zero and the I Ching  alt=a greyscale graph with multiple, jagged peaks and troughs and an overall descending pattern, set amidst complex virtual instrumentation \\"Timewave zero\\" is a numerological formula that purports to calculate the ebb and flow of \\"novelty\\", defined as increase over time in the universe's interconnectedness, or organized complexity. Terence McKenna claimed that the universe has a teleological attractor at the end of time that increases interconnectedness. He believed this which would eventually reach a singularity of infinite complexity in 2012, at which point anything and everything imaginable would occur simultaneously. He conceived this idea over several years in the early to mid-1970s whilst using psilocybin mushrooms and DMT. The scientific community considers novelty theory to be pseudoscience. McKenna expressed \\"novelty\\" in a computer program which produces a waveform known as \\"timewave zero\\" or the \\"timewave\\". Based on McKenna's interpretation of the King Wen sequence of the I Ching, an ancient Chinese book on divination, the graph purports to show great periods of novelty corresponding with major shifts in humanity's biological and sociocultural evolution. He believed that the events of any given time are resonantly related to the events of other times, and chose the atomic bombing of Hiroshima as the basis for calculating his end date of November 2012. When he later discovered this date's proximity to the end of the 13th b ºak ºtun of the Maya calendar, he revised his hypothesis so that the two dates matched. The 1975 first edition of The Invisible Landscape referred to 2012 (but no specific day during the year) only twice. In the 1993 second edition, McKenna employed Sharer's date of 21 December 2012 throughout. Novelty theory has been criticized for \\"rejecting countless ideas presumed as factual by the scientific community\\", depending \\"solely on numerous controversial deductions that contradict empirical logic\\", and encompassing \\"no suitable indication of truth\\", with the conclusion that novelty theory is a pseudoscience.  Doomsday theories  alt=A white, glowing, cloudlike feature lies surrounded by bright blue stars in a brownish, golden nebula The idea that the year 2012 presaged a world cataclysm, the end of the world, or the end of human civilization, became a subject of popular media speculation as the date of 21 December 2012 approached. This idea was promulgated by many pages on the Internet, particularly on YouTube. The Discovery Channel was criticized for its \\"quasi-documentaries\\" about the subject that \\"sacrifice[d] accuracy for entertainment\\".  Other alignments  Some people interpreted the galactic alignment apocalyptically, claiming that its occurrence would somehow create a combined gravitational effect between the Sun and the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy (known as Sagittarius A*), creating havoc on Earth. Apart from the \\"galactic alignment\\" already having happened in 1998, the Sun's apparent path through the zodiac as seen from Earth did not take it near the true galactic center, but rather several degrees above it. Even were this not the case, Sagittarius A* is 30,000 light years from Earth; it would have to have been more than 6 million times closer to cause any gravitational disruption to Earth's Solar System. This reading of the alignment was included on the History Channel documentary Decoding the Past. John Major Jenkins complained that a science fiction writer co-authored the documentary, and he went on to characterize it as \\"45 minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane sensationalism\\". Some believers in a 2012 doomsday used the term \\"galactic alignment\\" to describe a different phenomenon proposed by some scientists to explain a pattern in mass extinctions supposedly observed in the fossil record. According to the Shiva Hypothesis, mass extinctions are not random, but recur every 26 million years. To account for this, it was suggested that vertical oscillations made by the Sun on its 250-million-year orbit of the galactic center cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic plane which bisects the galactic disc, the influence of the galactic tide is weaker. However, when re-entering the galactic disc‚Äîas it does every 20‚Äì25 million years‚Äîit comes under the influence of the far stronger \\"disc tides\\", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of Oort cloud comets into the inner Solar System by a factor of 4, thus leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating comet impact. However, this \\"alignment\\" takes place over tens of millions of years, and could never be timed to an exact date. Evidence shows that the Sun passed through the plane bisecting the galactic disc three million years ago and in 2012 was moving farther above it. A third suggested alignment was some sort of planetary conjunction occurring on 21 December 2012; however, there was no conjunction on that date. Multi-planet alignments did occur in both 2000 and 2010, each with no ill result for the Earth. Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System; larger than all other planets combined. When Jupiter is near opposition, the difference in gravitational force that the Earth experiences is less than 1% of the force that the Earth feels daily from the Moon.  Geomagnetic reversal  Another idea tied to 2012 involved a geomagnetic reversal (often referred to as a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100 billion atomic bombs. This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's magnetic field was weakening, which could precede a reversal of the north and south magnetic poles, and the arrival of the next solar maximum, which was expected sometime around 2012. Most scientific estimates, however, say that geomagnetic reversals take between 1,000 and 10,000 years to complete, and do not start on any particular date. Furthermore, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that the solar maximum would peak in late 2013 or 2014, and that it would be fairly weak, with a below-average number of sunspots. In any case, there was no scientific evidence linking a solar maximum to a geomagnetic reversal, which is driven by forces entirely within the Earth. Instead, a solar maximum would be mostly notable for its effects on satellite and cellular phone communications. David Morrison attributed the rise of the solar storm idea to physicist and science popularizer Michio Kaku, who claimed in an interview with Fox News that a solar peak in 2012 could be disastrous for orbiting satellites, and to NASA's headlining a 2006 webpage as \\"Solar Storm Warning\\", a term later repeated on several doomsday pages. On 23 July 2012, a massive, potentially damaging, solar storm came within nine days of striking Earth.  Planet X/Nibiru  Some believers in a 2012 doomsday claimed that a planet called Planet X, or Nibiru, would collide with or pass by the Earth. This idea, which appeared in various forms since 1995, initially predicted Doomsday in May 2003, but proponents abandoned that date after it passed without incident. The idea originated from claims of channeling alien beings and is widely ridiculed. Astronomers calculated that such an object so close to Earth would be visible to anyone looking up at the night sky.  Other catastrophes  The alt=The Pleiades star cluster Author Graham Hancock, in his book Fingerprints of the Gods, interpreted Coe's remarks in Breaking the Maya Code as evidence for the prophecy of a global cataclysm. Filmmaker Roland Emmerich later credited the book with inspiring his 2009 disaster film 2012. Other speculations regarding doomsday in 2012 included predictions by the Web Bot project, a computer program that purports to predict the future by analyzing Internet chatter. However, commentators have rejected claims that the bot is able to predict natural disasters, as opposed to human-caused disasters like stock market crashes. The 2012 date was also loosely tied to the long-running concept of the Photon Belt, which predicted a form of interaction between Earth and Alcyone, the largest star of the Pleiades cluster. Critics argued that photons cannot form belts, that the Pleiades, located more than 400 light years away, could have no effect on Earth, and that the Solar System, rather than getting closer to the Pleiades, was in fact moving farther away from it. Some media outlets tied the fact that the red supergiant star Betelgeuse would undergo a supernova at some point in the future to the 2012 phenomenon. However, while Betelgeuse was certainly in the final stages of its life, and would die as a supernova, there was no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years. To be a threat to Earth, a supernova would need to be no further than 25 light years from the Solar System. Betelgeuse is roughly 600 light years away, and so its supernova would not affect Earth. In December 2011, NASA's Francis Reddy issued a press release debunking the possibility of a supernova occurring in 2012. Another claim involved alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, first published in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, it would have had to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived. In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.  Public reaction  The phenomenon spread widely after coming to public notice, particularly on the Internet. Hundreds of thousands of websites were posted on the subject. \\"Ask an Astrobiologist\\", a NASA public outreach website, received over 5,000 questions from the public on the subject from 2007, some asking whether they should kill themselves, their children or their pets. In May 2012, an Ipsos poll of 16,000 adults in 21 countries found that 8 percent had experienced fear or anxiety over the possibility of the world ending in December 2012, while an average of 10 percent agreed with the statement \\"the Mayan calendar, which some say 'ends' in 2012, marks the end of the world\\", with responses as high as 20 percent in China, 13 percent in Russia, Turkey, Japan and Korea, and 12 percent in the United States. At least one suicide was directly linked to fear of a 2012 apocalypse, with others anecdotally reported. Jared Lee Loughner, the perpetrator of the 2011 Tucson shooting, followed 2012-related predictions. A panel of scientists questioned on the topic at a plenary session at the Astronomical Society of the Pacific contended that the Internet played a substantial role in allowing this doomsday date to gain more traction than previous similar panics.  Europe  alt=A small village in a green field stands before a low, blue mountain peak alt=a small village of blue houses, next to a mountain Beginning in 2000, the small French village of Bugarach, population 189, began receiving visits from \\"esoterics\\"‚Äîmystic believers who had concluded that the local mountain, Pic de Bugarach, was the ideal location to weather the transformative events of 2012. In 2011, the local mayor, Jean- Pierre Delord, began voicing fears to the international press that the small town would be overwhelmed by an influx of thousands of visitors in 2012, even suggesting he might call in the army. \\"We've seen a huge rise in visitors\\", Delord told The Independent in March 2012. \\"Already this year more than 20,000 people have climbed right to the top, and last year we had 10,000 hikers, which was a significant rise on the previous 12 months. They think Pic de Bugarach is 'un garage √† ovnis' [a garage for UFOs]. The villagers are exasperated: the exaggerated importance of something which they see as completely removed from reality is bewildering. After 21 December, this will surely return to normal.\\" In December 2012, the French government placed 100 police and firefighters around both Bugarach and Pic de Bugarach, limiting access to potential visitors. Ultimately, only about 1,000 visitors appeared at the height of the \\"event\\". Two raves were foiled, 12 people had to be turned away from the peak, and 5 people were arrested for carrying weapons. Jean-Pierre Delord was criticised by members of the community for failing to take advantage of the media attention and promote the region. The Turkish village of ≈ûirince, near Ephesus, expected to receive over 60,000 visitors on 21 December 2012, as New Age mystics believed its \\"positive energy\\" would aid in weathering the catastrophe. Only a fraction of that number actually arrived, with a substantial component being police and journalists, and the expected windfall failed to materialise. Similarly, the pyramid-like mountain of Rtanj, in the Serbian Carpathians, attracted attention, due to rumors that it would emit a powerful force shield on the day, protecting those in the vicinity. Hotels around the base were full. In Russia, inmates of a women's prison experienced \\"a collective mass psychosis\\" in the weeks leading up to the supposed doomsday, while residents of a factory town near Moscow reportedly emptied a supermarket of matches, candles, food and other supplies. The Minister of Emergency Situations declared in response that according to \\"methods of monitoring what is occurring on the planet Earth\\", there would be no apocalypse in December. When asked when the world would end in a press conference, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, \\"In about 4.5 billion years.\\" In December 2012, Vatican astronomer Rev. Jos√© Funes wrote in the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano that apocalyptic theories around 2012 were \\"not even worth discussing\\".  Asia and Australia  In China, up to one thousand members of the Christian cult Almighty God were arrested after claiming that the end of b ºak ºtun 13 marked the end of the world, and that it was time to overthrow Communism. Shoppers were reported to be hoarding supplies of candles in anticipation of coming darkness, while online retailer Taobao sold tickets to board Noah's Ark to customers.\\"Â§ßÂä´\\"Â∞ÜËá≥ ‰∏≠ÂõΩÂá∫Áé∞Êú´Êó•ÂñßÂö£, cn.wsj.com Bookings for wedding ceremonies on 21 December 2012 were saturated in several cities. On 14 December 2012, a man in Henan province attacked and wounded twenty-three children with a knife. Authorities suspected the man had been \\"influenced\\" by the prediction of the upcoming apocalypse. Academics in China attributed the widespread belief in the 2012 doomsday in their country to a lack of scientific literacy and a mistrust of the government-controlled media. On 6 December 2012, Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard delivered a hoax speech for the radio station triple J in which she declared \\"My dear remaining fellow Australians; the end of the world is coming. Whether the final blow comes from flesh-eating zombies, demonic hell-beasts or from the total triumph of K-Pop, if you know one thing about me it is this‚ÄîI will always fight for you to the very end.\\" Radio announcer Neil Mitchell described the hoax as \\"immature\\" and pondered whether it demeaned her office. Mexico and Central America Those Mesoamerican countries that once formed part of the Maya civilization‚ÄîMexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador‚Äîall organized festivities to commemorate the end of b ºak ºtun 13 at the largest Maya sites. On 21 December 2011, the Maya town of Tapachula in Chiapas activated an eight-foot digital clock counting down the days until the end of b ºak ºtun 13. On 21 December 2012, major events took place at Chich√©n Itz√° in Mexico and Tikal in Guatemala. In El Salvador, the largest event was held at Tazumal, and in Honduras, at Cop√°n. In all of these archaeological sites, Maya rituals were held at dawn led by shamans and Maya priests. The Mayan fire ceremony held at dawn in Tikal on 21 December 2012, took place in the main plaza in front of the Temple of the Great Jaguar. On the final day of b ºak ºtun 13, residents of Yucat√°n and other regions formerly dominated by the ancient Maya celebrated what they saw as the dawn of a new, better era. According to official figures from Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), about 50,000 people visited Mexican archaeological sites on 21 December 2012. Of those, 10,000 visited Chich√©n Itz√° in Yucat√°n, 9,900 visited Tulum in Quintana Roo, and 8,000 visited Palenque in Chiapas. An additional 10,000 people visited Teotihuacan near Mexico City, which is not a Maya site. The main ceremony in Chich√©n Itz√° was held at dawn in the plaza of the Temple of Kukulk√°n, one of the principal symbols of Maya culture. The archaeological site was opened two hours early to receive thousands of tourists, mostly foreigners who came to participate in events scheduled for the end of b ºak ºtun 13. The fire ceremony at Tikal was held at dawn in the main plaza of the Temple of the Great Jaguar. The ceremony was led by Guatemalan and foreign priests. The President of Guatemala, Otto P√©rez, and of Costa Rica, Laura Chinchilla, participated in the event as special guests. During the ceremony the priests asked for unity, peace and the end of discrimination and racism, with the hope that the start of a new cycle will be a \\"new dawn\\". About 3,000 people participated in the event. Most of these events were organized by agencies of the Mexican and Central American governments, and their respective tourism industries expected to attract thousands of visitors. Mexico is visited by about 22 million foreigners in a typical year. However, in 2012, the national tourism agency expected to attract 52 million visitors just to the regions of Chiapas, Yucat√°n, Quintana Roo, Tabasco and Campeche. A Maya activist group in Guatemala, Oxlaljuj Ajpop, objected to the commercialization of the date. A spokesman from the Conference of Maya Ministers commented that for them the Tikal ceremony is not a show for tourists but something spiritual and personal. The secretary of the Great Council of Ancestral Authorities commented that living Maya felt they were excluded from the activities in Tikal. This group held a parallel ceremony, and complained that the date has been used for commercial gain. In addition, before the main Tikal ceremony, about 200 Maya protested the celebration because they felt excluded. Most modern Maya were indifferent to the ceremonies, and the small number of people still practising ancient rites held solemn, more private ceremonies. Osvaldo Gomez, a technical advisor to the Tikal site, complained that many visitors during the celebration had illegally climbed the stairs of the Temple of the Masks, causing \\"irreparable\\" damage.  South America  In Brazil, D√©cio Colla, the Mayor of the City of S√£o Francisco de Paula, Rio Grande do Sul, mobilized the population to prepare for the end of the world by stocking up on food and supplies. In the city of Corguinho, in the Mato Grosso do Sul, a colony was built for survivors of the expected tragedy. In Alto Para√≠so de Goi√°s, the hotels also made specific reservations for prophetic dates. In Bolivia, President Evo Morales participated in Quechua and Aymara rituals, organized with government support, to commemorate the Southern solstice that took place in Isla del Sol, in the southern part of Lake Titicaca. During the event, Morales proclaimed the beginning of \\"Pachakuti\\", meaning the world's wake up to a culture of life and the beginning of the end to wild capitalism, and he proposed to dismantle the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. On 21 December 2012, the Uritorco in C√≥rdoba, Argentina was closed, as a mass suicide there had been proposed on Facebook. North America In the United States, sales of private underground blast shelters increased noticeably after 2009, with many construction companies' advertisements calling attention to the 2012 apocalypse. In Michigan, schools were closed for the Christmas holidays two days early, in part because rumours of the 2012 apocalypse were raising fears of repeat shootings similar to that at Sandy Hook. American reality TV stars Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt revealed that they had spent most of their $10 million of accumulated earnings by 2010 because they believed the world would end in 2012.  2012 after 2012  Authors such as Graham Hancock continue to refer to supposed Maya prophecies about 2012 in Magicians of the Gods (2015). For example, he writes, ‚Äú... the Maya were not speaking of the end of the world, as such, but rather the end of an age‚Äî‚Äòa time of great transformation and world rebirth‚Äô‚Äîthat would be followed by the beginning of a new great cycle or world age‚Äù.  Cultural influence  The 2012 phenomenon was discussed or referenced in several media. Several TV documentaries, as well as some contemporary fictional references to the year 2012, referred to 21 December as the day of a cataclysmic event. The UFO conspiracy TV series The X-Files cited 22 December 2012 as the date for an alien colonization of the Earth and mentioned the Mayan calendar \\"stopping\\" on this date. The History Channel aired a handful of special series on doomsday that included analysis of 2012 theories, such as Decoding the Past (2005‚Äì2007), 2012, End of Days (2006), Last Days on Earth (2006), Seven Signs of the Apocalypse (2009), and Nostradamus 2012 (2008). The Discovery Channel also aired 2012 Apocalypse in 2009, suggesting that massive solar storms, magnetic pole reversal, earthquakes, supervolcanoes, and other drastic natural events could occur in 2012. In 2012, the National Geographic Channel launched a show called Doomsday Preppers, a documentary series about survivalists preparing for various cataclysms, including the 2012 doomsday. Hundreds of books were published on the topic. The bestselling book of 2009, Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol, featured a coded mock email number (2456282.5) that decoded to the Julian date for 21 December 2012. In cinema, the 2009 disaster film 2012 was inspired by the phenomenon, and advance promotion prior to its release included a stealth marketing campaign in which TV spots and websites from the fictional \\"Institute for Human Continuity\\" called on people to prepare for the end of the world. As these promotions did not mention the film itself, many viewers believed them to be real and contacted astronomers in panic. Although the campaign was heavily criticized, the film became one of the most successful of its year, grossing nearly $770 million worldwide. An article in The Daily Telegraph attributed the widespread fear of the 2012 phenomenon in China to the film, which was a smash hit in that country because it depicted the Chinese building \\"survival arks\\". Lars von Trier's 2011 film Melancholia featured a plot in which a planet emerges from behind the Sun on a collision course with Earth. The phenomenon also inspired several rock and pop music hits. As early as 1997, \\"A Certain Shade of Green\\" by Incubus referred to the mystical belief that a shift in perception would arrive in 2012 (\\"Are you gonna stand around till 2012 A.D.? / What are you waiting for, a certain shade of green?\\"). More recent hits include \\"2012 (It Ain't the End)\\" (2010) performed by Jay Sean and \\"Till the World Ends\\" (2011) performed by Britney Spears. Towards mid-December 2012, an internet hoax related to South Korean singer Psy being one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse was widely circulated around social media platforms. The hoax purported that once Psy's \\"Gangnam Style\\" YouTube video amassed a billion views, the world would end. Indian composer A. R. Rahman, known for Slumdog Millionaire, released his single \\"Infinite Love\\" to \\"instill faith and optimism in people\\" prior to the predicted doomsday. The artwork for All Time Low's 2012 album \\"Don't Panic\\" satirizes various cataclysmic events associated with the world ending on 21 December 2012. A number of brands ran commercials tied to the 2012 apocalypse in the months and days leading to the date. In February 2012, American automotive company General Motors aired an advertisement during the annual Super Bowl football game in which a group of friends drove Chevrolet Silverados through the ruins of human civilization following the 2012 apocalypse, while on 17 December 2012, Jell-O ran an ad saying that offering Jell-O to the Mayan gods would appease them into sparing the world. John Verret, Professor of Advertising at Boston University, questioned the utility of tying large sums of money to such a unique and short-term event.

The reason for the number's importance is uncertain, though correlations to the phases of the moon and to the human gestation period have been suggested. * The Mayan calendar, unlike the Western calendar, used a zero. * Rather than \\"0.0.0.0.0\\", the Mayan Long Count represented the date of creation as \\"13.0.0.0.0\\" * Most Mayanist scholars, such as Mark Van Stone and Anthony Aveni, adhere to the \\"GMT (Goodman-Martinez-Thompson) correlation\\" with the Long Count, which places the start date at 11 August 3114 BC and the end date of b ºak ºtun 13 at 21 December 2012. This date was also the overwhelming preference of those who believed in 2012 eschatology, arguably, Van Stone suggests, because it was a solstice, and was thus astrologically significant. Some Mayanist scholars, such as Michael D. Coe, Linda Schele and Marc Zender, adhere to the \\"Lounsbury/GMT+2\\" correlation, which sets the start date at 13 August and the end date at 23 December. Which of these is the precise correlation has yet to be conclusively settled. * Coe's initial date was \\"24 December 2011\\". He revised it to \\"11 January AD 2013\\" in the 1980 2nd edition of his book, not settling on 23 December 2012 until the 1984 3rd edition. The correlation of b ºak ºtun 13 as 21 December 2012 first appeared in Table B.2 of Robert J. Sharer's 1983 revision of the 4th edition of Sylvanus Morley's book The Ancient Maya .

FOXO1 is a transcription factor that plays important roles in regulation of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis by insulin signaling, and is also central to the decision for a preadipocyte to commit to adipogenesis. It is primarily regulated through phosphorylation on multiple residues; its transcriptional activity is dependent on its phosphorylation state.  Function   Adipogenesis  FOXO1-dependent inhibition of adipogenesis FOXO1 negatively regulates adipogenesis. Presently, the exact mechanism by which this is accomplished is not entirely understood. In the currently accepted model, FOXO1 negatively regulates adipogenesis by binding to the promoter sites of PPARG and preventing its transcription. Rising levels of PPARG are required to initiate adipogenesis; by preventing its transcription, FOXO1 is preventing the onset of adipogenesis. During stimulation by insulin, FOXO1 is excluded from the nucleus and is subsequently unable to prevent transcription of PPARG and inhibit adipogenesis. However, there is substantial evidence to suggest that there are other factors that mediate the interaction between FOXO1 and the PPARG promoter, and that inhibition of adipogenesis is not entirely dependent on FOXO1 preventing transcription of PPARG. The failure to commit to adipogenesis is primarily due to active FOXO1 arresting the cell in G0/G1 through activation of yet unknown downstream targets, with a putative target being SOD2. FOXO1 belongs to the forkhead family of transcription factors that are characterized by a distinct fork head domain. The specific function of this gene has not yet been determined; however, it may play a role in myogenic growth and differentiation. FOXO1 is essential for the maintenance of human ESC pluripotency. This function is probably mediated through direct control by FOXO1 of OCT4 and SOX2 gene expression through occupation and activation of their respective promoters. In hepatic cells this transcription factor seems to increase the expression of PEPCK and glycogen-6-phosphatase (the same enzymes that are blocked via the metformin/AMPK/SHP pathway). Blocking this transcription factor offers an opportunity for novel therapies for diabetes mellitus. In pancreatic alpha-cells FOXO1 is important in regulating prepro- glucagon expression. In pancreatic beta cells FOXO1 mediates glucagon-like peptide-1 effects on pancreatic beta-cell mass.  Gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis  Depicts insulin-regulated nuclear exclusion of FOXO1 and its effect on transcription of glucose-6 phosphatase When the level of blood glucose is high, the pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin then causes the activation of PI3K, which subsequently phosphorylates Akt. Akt then phosphorylates FOXO1, causing nuclear exclusion. This phosphorylated FOXO1 is then ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteosome. The phosphorylation of FOXO1 is irreversible; this prolongs insulin's inhibitory effect on glucose metabolism and hepatic glucose production. Transcription of glucose 6-phosphatase subsequently decreases, which consequently decreases the rates of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. FOXO1 also activates transcription of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which is required for gluconeogenesis. The activity of FOXO1 is also regulated through CBP induced acetylation on Lys-242, Lys-245, and Lys-262. These lysine residues are located within the DNA-binding domain; acetylation inhibits the ability of FOXO1 to interact with the glucose-6 phosphatase promoter by decreasing the stability of the FOXO1-DNA complex. Additionally, this acetylation increases the rate of phosphorylation on Ser-253 by Akt. Mutating Ser-253 to Ala-253 makes FOXO1 constitutively active. SIRT1 reverses this acetylation process; however, the exact mechanism by which SIRT1 deacetylates FOXO1 is still under investigation; presently, acetylation is thought to mitigate the transcriptional activity of FOXO1 and thereby provide an additional level of metabolic regulation that is independent of the insulin/PI3K pathway.  Apoptosis  FOXO1 may play an important role in apoptosis because it is phosphorylated and inhibited by AKT. When FOXO1 over expressed in human LNCaP prostate cancer cells, it caused apoptosis in these cancer cells. Also, It is detected that FOXO1 regulateTNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which cause FOXO1-induced apoptosis in the human prostate cancer cell line LAPC4 when FOXO1 adenovirus-mediated overexpression was used. FOXO1 upregulate Fas ligand (FasL) transcriptionally that result in promotes apoptotic cell death. Additionally, FOXO1 trans-activate Bim protein, which a member of the Bcl-2 family that promotes apoptosis and plays a role in the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Further, it was revealed that DNA damage- induced cell death in p53-deficient and p53-proficient cells reduced when human FOXO1 silenced by siRNA. In type 2 diabetes the beta cells of the pancreas, which normally produce insulin undergo apoptosis, which greatly reduces the production of insulin. Fatty acids in the beta cells activate FOXO1, resulting in apopotosis of the beta cells.  Cell Cycle Regulation  FOXO1 activation plays a role in cell cycle progression regulation. The transcription and half- life of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27KIP1 rises when FOXO1 is active. A study detects that FOXO1 regulates the nuclear localization of p27KIP1 in porcine granulosa cells and impacts cell cycle progression. Furthermore, FOXO1-mediated cell cycle arrest is linked with cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 suppression in mammals. It was detected that human FOXO1 is linked with the cyclin D1 promoter using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP assays). H215R is a human FOXO1 mutant, which cannot bind to the canonical FRE to induce expression of p27KIP1, repress cyclin D1 and cyclin D2 promoter activity and encourages cell cycle arrest at cyclin G1 (CCNG1). As a result of that, activation of FOXO1 prevents the cell- division cycle at cyclin G1 (CCNG1) out of one of two ways stimulating or suppressing gene transcription.  Mechanism of action  In its un- phosphorylated state, FOXO1 is localized to the nucleus, where it binds to the insulin response sequence located in the promoter for glucose 6-phosphatase and increases its rate of transcription. FOXO1, through increasing transcription of glucose-6-phosphatase, indirectly increases the rate of hepatic glucose production. However, when FOXO1 is phosphorylated by Akt on Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319, it is excluded from the nucleus, where it is then ubiquitinated and degraded. The phosphorylation of FOXO1 by Akt subsequently decreases the hepatic glucose production through a decrease in transcription of glucose 6-phosphatase.  Regulation  There are three processes, namely acetylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination that are responsible for regulation of the activity of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1).  Phosphorylation  Phosphorylation of the FOXO1 protein is a result of the activation of the PI3K /AKT pathway. Serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase SGK can also phosphorylate and inactivate FOXO1 transcription factor. FOXO1 translocate from the nucleus to cytoplasm and inactivate through phosphorylation at well-defined sites by AKT/SGK1 protein kinases. FOXO1 transcription factor can phosphorylate directly by AKT/SGK1 on three sites T24, S256 and S319. Additionally, FOXO1 loses its interactions with DNA when phosphorylated by AKT/SGK1 because S256, which is one of the three AKT/SGK sites, changes the DNA-binding domain charge from a positive charge to a negative charge. Insulin signaling substrates 1 and 2 of the insulin-signaling cascade also regulate FOXO1 through phosphorylation by AKT. AKT, which is referred to as protein kinase B, phosphorylates FOXO1 and accumulates in the cytosol. Casein kinase 1, a growth factor-activated protein kinase, also phosphorylates and potentiates FOXO1 and translocates FOXO1 to the cytoplasm.  Research  Because FOXO1 provides a link between transcription and metabolic control by insulin, it is also a potential target for genetic control of type 2 diabetes. In the insulin-resistant murine model, there is increased hepatic glucose production due to a loss in insulin sensitivity; the rates of hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis are increased when compared to normal mice; this is presumably due to un-regulated FOXO1. When the same experiment was repeated with haploinsufficient FOXO1, insulin sensitivity was partially restored, and hepatic glucose production subsequently decreased. Similarly, in mice fed with a high fat diet (HFD), there is increased insulin resistance in skeletal and liver cells. However, when haploinsufficient FOXO1 mice were treated with the same HFD, there was a notable decrease in insulin resistance in both skeletal and liver cells. This effect was significantly augmented by the simultaneous administration of rosiglitazone, which is a commonly prescribed anti-diabetic drug. These results create an opportunity for a novel gene therapy based approach to alleviating insulin desensitization in type 2 diabetes. In diabetes (both type 1 and type 2), gluconeogenesis in the kidney contributes more to blood glucose than it does in normal subjects. Enhancing suppression of FOXO1 by insulin can reduce gluconeogenesis in both the liver and kidney. In HFD-fed mice, the combination of FOXO1 and Notch-1 haploinsufficiency was more effective at restoring insulin sensitivity than FOXO1 haploinsufficiency alone. Insulin- producing cells could be generated through the inhibition of FOXO1 in intestinal organoids generated from intestinal stem cells isolated from adult tissue.  Clinical significance  * Translocation of this gene with PAX3 has been associated with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. * In Gluconeogenesis, FOXO1 gene regulates the glucose levels due to the low output of hepatic glucose. In mice, it cuts fasting blood glucose levels by inhibiting formulation of the gluconeogenic genes. * FOXO1 plays a role in the protection of cells from oxidative stress. It seems to promote cell death when oxidative stress is high in tissues that are involved in diabetic complications. In such situations, it has a destructive role instead of a protective role. * FOXO1 helps in wound healing in mice through coordination of response of keratinocytes and functions in keratinocytes to bring down oxidative stress. Wound healing is a very complicated biological process and studies have indicated that FOXO1 transcription factor helps in orchestrating events that enhance the healing process in keratinocytes. Localization of FOXO1 nuclear increased four times in wound-healing keratinocytes. It encourages the migration of the keratinocytes through upregulating the growth factor. * In the Innate Immune system, FOXO1 has been proved to enhance inflammation through increasing formulation of several proinflammatory genes. It mediates formulation of proinflammatory cytokines in response to high glucose levels, TNF and LPS stimulation. * In Adaptive Immunity system, FOXO1 regulates the return of peripheral B cells by upregulation of L-section and controls class-switch recombination of peripheral B cells and in T cells it enhances survival of CD8 memory. * In Carcinogenesis, FOXO1 plays a role of a tumor suppressor and its inactivation has been documented in many kinds of human cancer. It suppresses survival of tumor cells by inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer cells and glioma cells by upregulating the proapoptotic factors. Increased activation of FOXO1 may inhibit the metastasis of the prostate cancer cells to other organs by suppressing the migration and invasion or suppressing the Runt-domain containing Runx2 transcriptional activity.  Interactions  FOXO1 has been shown to interact with: * androgen receptor, * estrogen receptor alpha, * CREB-binding protein, and * tuberous sclerosis protein 2.

During these interdisciplinary campaigns, together with William Tabbernee of Tulsa, numerous unknown ancient settlements were discovered and archaeologically documented. Two of them are the best candidates so far in the search for the identification of the two holy centers of ancient Montanism, Pepouza and Tymion. The Montanist patriarch resided at Pepouza, and the Montanists expected the heavenly Jerusalem to descend to earth at Pepouza and Tymion. In late antiquity, both places attracted crowds of pilgrims from all over the Roman Empire. Scholars had searched for these lost sites since the 19th century.

It is used as an ingredient in the traditional medicine of China, where it is called ejiao (). The gelatin is produced in several coastal provinces of China: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong. Shandong's Dong'e County was where \\"ejiao\\" got its name. According to a ca. 1723 account by the French Jesuit Dominique Parrenin, there was a well in Dong'e which was normally kept closed and sealed, and which was only opened when water was taken to be used in preparation of ejiao for the emperor's court. (This is a reprint; the original text was published in the first half of the 18th century. E xian (for Dong'e) and Ejiao are transcribed Ngo-hien and Ngo-kiao, under the transcription system then in use). Manufacture According to Parennin, the product was traditionally prepared during the late fall and winter (from after the harvest and until the beginning of March). It was supposed to be made from the skin of a recently killed well-nourished black donkey. Since the supply of this material was rather limited, it was said that a large amount of \\"fake\\" ejiao was also manufactured, using skins from mules, horses, camels, pigs, and sometimes, it was said, even from old shoes; a bit of \\"real stuff\\" was added to it, to deceive consumers. Ejiao is either prepared as dry gelatin or mixed with powdered oyster shell or pollen to form glue balls. It tastes sweet. Jesuits noted that while the \\"real\\" ejiao has no disagreeable taste or smell, the fake product could be distinguished by its unpleasant smell and taste, even when it was made from pig skins (which, supposedly, provided the best approximation of the real thing). In the 21st century, ejiao manufacturers experience problems with the supply of genuine donkey hides, as fewer people raise these animals these days. The decreasing supply combined with strong demand for ejiao has led to greatly increased prices for donkey hides in China. This trend is also supported by restrictions on importing animal hides from outside the country. Qin Yufeng, the chairman of a major ejiao manufacturer and a member of Shandong's provincial legislature, has advocated for government support for donkey husbandry. Donkey thefts and population declines In the mid-2010s, donkey prices in many places around the world began to rise sharply with demand for Chinese traditional medicine. Uganda, Tanzania, Botswana, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal have banned donkey exports to China. In November 2017, eyewitness footage showing baby donkeys being bludgeoned to death with sledgehammers or killed by having their throats cut was released by PETA Asia. In November 2019, The Donkey Sanctuary reported that 4.8 million donkey hides were required to satisfy the global demand for ejiao, resulting in steep declines of donkey populations around the world. Donkey populations are declining in the NorthEast of Brazil, due to Chinese demand. Applications In China ejiao is a traditional medicine used for different types of illnesses.https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/3039011/chinese- medicine-ejiao-has-left-worlds-donkey-population-crisis An amount of 5 to 10 grams may be dissolved in hot water or wine and mixed with other ingredients in the traditional Chinese materia medica or taken alone. It is believed that donkey-hide gelatin treats a variety of conditions such as bleeding, dizziness, insomnia and a dry cough. Quite a few manufacturers produce an ejiao bar called \\"gu yuan gao\\" (Âõ∫ÂÖÉËÜè) in Shandong province. Gu yuan gao is made up of ejiao, nuts, sesame, Chinese dates and cooking wine.https://www.thestatesman.com/supplements/8thday/now-its-the-turn-of-the- donkey-1502690917.html It can also be used as an edible coating for dates, producing another type of snack. Ejiao is also used for applying di mo, a special paper-like musical reed membrane, to the dizi, a transverse Chinese flute; it dries quickly, holds quite firmly, and is water-soluble, allowing later replacement of di mo. The molecular basis for its usage in treating anemia has been shown at least in part from the peptidic components combining multiple approaches. The hematopoietic effect of colla corii asini (ejiao) may benefit cancer patients suffering from myelosuppression due to radiotherapy or chemotherapy.

Pfau, also known as Father John Doe (10 November 1904 - 19 February 1967) was the author of Sobriety Without End, Sobriety and Beyond and the Golden Book series. He is believed to have been the first Roman Catholic priest to enter Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Early life Pfau was born on November 10, 1904, the youngest of five brothers. A sixth brother had died before he was born. His father, who was of French descent, died when Pfau was four. Pfau was raised by his mother, who came from an Indiana German family. They were devout Catholics. Several family members had served the church: his uncle George was a priest. His uncle Al was the Bishop of Nashville, Tennessee. His older brother Jerome was a priest who had earned a doctorate from Rome, and taught at St. Mary-of-the-Woods College. Ralph‚Äôs mother referred to him as her son who was going to become a priest, which created pressure on him as he was growing up. Education He was ordained at St. Meinrad Seminary, and received a Master of Arts in Education at Fordham University. He became a priest in the Archdiocese of Indianapolis, Career On June 29, 1942 Pfau was appointed pastor of St. Ann's of Indianapolis by Bishop Ritter. Pfau remained in service at St. Ann's until June 14, 1943. He was unsure he wanted to be a priest, and for many years, especially during his periods in sanitariums, and during the worst periods of his alcoholism, he continued to doubt the validity of his ordination. But he eventually came to believe that, though he had not chosen the priesthood, he was chosen for it. Alcoholism and recovery He took his first drink about a year after his ordination. By 1943 he was sufficiently worried about his drinking to investigate A.A. He experienced nervous breakdowns and spent time in sanitariums. He was twice relieved of his parish. Even after achieving sobriety, he continued to be plagued by depressions. He learned about AA when calling on a parishioner who was thought to be dying but was just passed out from alcohol and drugs. Pfau noticed a copy of the book, Alcoholics Anonymous on the shelf. He borrowed and read it. He stopped drinking. Later he read pamphlets on AA left by a member in the church. During this period of not drinking he stepped up the medication the doctor had prescribed, a combination of barbital and Dexedrine. He eventually called the person whose name was on the brochures, Doherty Sheerin, who introduced Pfau to the program. That was November 10, 1941, Pfau's 37th birthday. For the next 25 years, despite severe problems with depressions, he never took another drink. For a short time he continued to take medications prescribed by his doctor and by Mayo Clinic. He threw them away after discussing the problem with a doctor familiar with alcoholism. Helping other alcoholics With the approval of his Archbishop, he devoted himself to helping other alcoholics, particularly alcoholic priests. He traveled more than 50,000 miles a year to address meetings, conduct retreats and help individuals. His retreats were attended by thousands of Catholics and by many more thousands who were not Catholics. His retreat talks were eventually published in a series of 14 Golden Books. They were so named because when he held the second annual retreat in June 1947, at the request of some of the people who had attended the first retreat his talks were printed in a fifty-six page booklet with a gold cover, and distributed as a souvenir, through the generosity of the owner of the archdiocesan newspaper in Indianapolis. People began requesting copies of \\"the golden book of your retreat.\\" In 1948 he founded the National Clergy Conference on Alcoholism, an organization devoted to the problems of priests, and directed it for many years. Its publications, especially \\"Alcoholism Source Book for Priests,\\" and the annual \\"Blue Book,\\" made a deep impact on the American Catholic Hierarchy. Role of religion in Alcoholics Anonymous Pfau favored limiting religious references to the absolute minimum in order to avoid offending newcomers. Quote about Pfau \\"the whole career of Father Pfau can only be understood in the light of the fact that he was a pioneer. He broke new ground. ... Like any pioneer he met opposition and had to have fortitude. Like any Christian innovator he had to have deep faith. It was faith and fortitude that sustained his zeal for the salvation of the countless souls he helped.\\" - Fr. John C. Ford, S. J., in an Epilogue to an edition of Pfau's autobiography, published after his death.

It is named after the main production site of Fushun, Liaoning province in northeastern China. History The Fushun process was developed and utilized for the extraction of shale oil in China during the mid-1920s. The commercial-scale utilization of the process began in 1930 with the construction of \\"Refinery No. 1\\". After World War II, the shale oil production was ceased, but 100 Fushun-type oil shale retorts were restored in 1949. In 1950, total 266 retorts were in operation, each with the capacity of 100‚Äì200 tons of shale oil per day. With the discovery of Daqing oil field in the 1960s, the shale oil production declined and Sinopec, an operator of shale oil production these times, shut down its oil shale operations in the beginning of the 1990s. At the same time, the Fushun Oil Shale Retorting Plant, using Fushun process technology, was established as a part of the Fushun Mining Group. It started production in 1992. In 2005, China became the largest shale oil producer in the world. In 1985-1986, Sinopec used the Fushun process for a test processing of Jordan's oil shale from the El Lajjun deposit. Although the process was technically viable, the cooperation was halted due to high operation costs. Technology The Fushun process is classified as an internal combustion technology but also includes external gas heating. It uses a vertical cylindrical type shaft retort, with outside steel plate lined with inner fire bricks. The retort has height over and its inner diameter is about . Raw oil shale particles with the size of are fed from the top of the retort. At the upper section of the retort oil shale is dried and heated by the ascending hot gases, which pass upward through the descending oil shale causing decomposition of the rock. The pyrolysis takes place at about . The produced oil vapor and gases exit from the top of the retort; hot gases and oil vapors move from the bottom to the top directly, and not diagonally like in Kiviter process. During the pyrolysis process, oil shale is decomposed to shale coke (char), which together with the ascending air-steam is burnt in the lower part of the retort to heat gases necessary for pyrolysis. These gases are recirculated; after leaving retort, they are cooled in a condensation system, where shale oil is condensed, and re-heated in a heating furnace about to before reinserting into the retort. The shale ash exits from a rotating water dish that acts as a seal and cooler at the bottom of the retort. Retorts are operated in sets and have a heat carrier preparation unit and rotating water seals designed for the whole set instead of a single retort as in case of the Kiviter retort. Regenerative furnaces are located next to the retorts and they are operating in two cycles ‚Äì the combustion cycle and the gas heating cycle. During the combustion cycle, a furnace is heated up to by combustion gases. After the combustion cycle, retort gases from the condensation system is inserted into a furnace for their heating. By alternating furnaces, one furnace is always available for heating retort gas. Twenty retorts typically share one condensation system and a set of heating furnaces. Advantages of the Fushun process include small investment and stable operation. The process is characterized by the high thermal efficiency, but due to the addition of air into the retort, the nitrogen dilutes the pyrolysis gas. In addition, the excess oxygen in retort burns out a part of produced shale oil, which reduce the shale oil yield. The oil yield of the Fushun retort accounts for about 65% of Fischer Assay. Disadvantage of this process is a high water consumption amounting to 6‚Äì7 barrels of water per barrel of produced shale-oil, and great quantities of waste shale. It is not suitable of ores with small size and oil content lower than 5%. As the capacity of single retort is limited, Fushun process is suitable for small-scale retorting plants, and for processing lean oil shale with low gas yield. Commercial use Fushun process is used only in China. The Fushun Mining Group operates the largest by capacity shale oil plant in the world (Fushun Shale Oil Plant) consisting of 180 Fushun retorts. Each retort processes about 4 tonnes of oil shale per hour.

AlBeMet AM162 is manufactured by Materion Corporation Brush Beryllium and Composites (formerly known as Brush Wellman). AlBeMet is formed by hot consolidating gas atomized prealloyed powder. Each powder particle contains aluminium between beryllium dendrites producing a uniform microstructure. Aluminium-beryllium metal matrix composite combines the high modulus and low density characteristics of beryllium with the fabrication and mechanical property behaviors of aluminium. Due to weight advantage, Be-Al alloys are used in aerospace and satellite applications. Basic properties The composition of AlBeMet AM162 by relative weight is 38% Al, 62% Be. AlBeMet has a density of 2.071 g/cm¬≥ (0.07482 lb/in¬≥). Mechanical properties The mechanical properties of AM162 have been characterized in all three-product forms with the extruded product form of AlBeMet having a significant design database. The extruded bar is fabricated by cold isostatic pressing (CIPing) the isotropic spherical aluminium- beryllium powder into semi-dense billets and then canning the billet for subsequent extrusion with a minimum of a 4:1 reduction ratio. Mechanical properties are minimum values at room temperature. Wrought mechanical properties for extrusions are in the longitudinal direction. Transverse properties are generally lower. A number of standard extrusion dies are available. Rolled product is available in a thickness range of 0.063‚Äù to 0.313‚Äù √ó 25‚Äù (0.16 to 0.795 cm √ó 63.5 cm) length times width dependent on gauge. Mechanical properties for HIP‚Äôd, extruded, and/or rolled AlBe metal matrix composites are in the annealed condition. Physical properties *High modulus-to-density ratio, 3.8 times that of aluminium or steel, minimizes flexure and reduces the chance of mechanically induced failure. *Thermal conductivity of approximately 210 W/m‚ãÖK exceeds by about 25% that of common aluminium metal matrix composites such as Al 6061\\\\. *Polished AlBeMet exhibits significant surface scatter inherent in the composite structure and cannot be eliminated by optical polishing. (Typical surface roughness from an AlBeMet polished surface is in the 200‚Äì250 √Ö finish.) An amorphous coating such as electroless nickel is required. Surfaces in the 15 to 20 √Ö level are achievable, depending on the CTE of the substrate material, a potential penalty of bi-metallic effect between substrate and nickel surface finish is possible. With the tailoring of electroless nickel, this material dictates that the phosphorus content in the plating bath be approximately 11% to insure a CTE match close to that of the AlBeMet thereby eliminating any bi-metallic effect. Fatigue properties The fatigue properties of AlBeMet extruded material have been tested using the Krause rotating beam fatigue test utilizing fully reversed cycles with a R = +0.1. The fatigue limit, 1 √ó 107 cycles was about 207 MPa (30 ksi) in the longitudinal direction and 165 MPa (25 ksi) in the transverse direction. This property is approximately 75% of the minimum RT yield strength, which is two times that of typical fatigue properties of 6061T6 aluminium. Manufacture of AlBeMet components AlBeMet parts can be manufactured with the same techniques normally used for aluminium, meaning that special tools do not need to be developed. Although the material is safe to handle when not being worked on,https://materion.com/-/media/files/beryllium/albemet- materials/maab-032albemettechnicaldatasheet.pdf the carcinogenic properties mean that special precautions must be taken to avoid exposure during machining with respiratory protection needed where dust could be formed.

Enders Reservoir State Recreation Area is a popular location for fishing, hunting and other outdoor recreation activities. Flows in the Frenchman, and associated releases from Enders Reservoir, have declined over the years. The primary cause is believed to be the lowering of water table levels due to groundwater irrigation in the Frenchman Basin.

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Savski Venac. Major facility in the neighborhood is the new Belgrade Centre railway station, opened for limited use in 2016.  Location  Belgrade Centre railway station Prokop is located at the southern edges of downtown Belgrade to which it is directly connected by the Kneza Milo≈°a street. It borders the area of former Zapadni Vraƒçar on the north, Mostar and Senjak on the west and Dedinje on the south. It is bounded by three boulevards: Fran≈°e D'Eperea (named after general D'Esperey and in fact a part of A1 highway), Vojvode Putnika and Kneza Aleksandra Karaƒëorƒëeviƒáa (named after Prince Alexandre).  History  Prokop is located in the eastern section of the former neighborhood of Jatagan Mala. Previously, it was a geographical reference, as the area was located in the lower valley of the now underground stream of Mokrolu≈°ki Potok. The gully already existed, which by the late 19th century already marked the division between the urbanized city territory and unurbanized outskirts. The earth and gravel were dug here and used to cover and drain the swamps on the Sava's right bank, so that neighborhoods of Savamala and Bara Venecija could be constructed, and especially because of the construction of the Belgrade Main railway station in 1884. After the works were completed, the area around Mokrolu≈°ki Potok was left as a steep, elongated cut in the ground and so got its name (Serbian prokop, cut or dug through). Ruling prince, later king Milan personally suggested this area, which stretched above the ƒêorƒëe Vajfert's brewery and the neighborhood of Smutekovac. He cited many reasons like the quality of the earth or closeness to the construction site which would reduce the transportation costs, as the money was indeed lacking. However, that land belonged to his wife, Princess Natalie, so the prince even earned money from the station's construction. In a historical twist, the Prokop is today location of the central railway station in Belgrade. Digging of the material continued until 1898, when the filling of Bara Venecija was completely finished. During the digging of the materials, the former gully was expanded and became long, wide and deep. As the ground was fertile, the gully was first cultivated, mainly for corn and vegetables. After World War I, the settlement began to develop, just like the neighboring Jatagan Mala. First settlers were railroad workers and those who were employed in the neighboring factories, and had to leave their crumbly houses in the city, which were demolished in order to make way for the new, modern residential blocks. The main street was laid as the central thoroughfare at the bottom of the gully, while the side streets were parallel, almost as if the settlement was planned. This original section of Prokop had no hovels, but only proper houses and even junior clerks from city and state administration moved in. Growing into the eastern extension of the already impoverished shanty town Jatagan Mala, some parts of Prokop grew even more destitute and were considered some of the poorest neighborhoods of Belgrade. Due to that, as well as the lack of any communal infrastructure or plans for the area, and a fact that geographically the settlement actually existed at the bottom of a big hole, during rains floods and mudslides were common, like in the winter of 1935. It was reported that at extremely snowy winters, due to the defile-like configuration, people would exit houses through chimneys as the bottom of the gully would be completely buried under the snow. As a curiosity, the daily newspaper Politika from 8 March 2007 reprinted its own article from 1957 about Prokop. The article, titled \\"For how long will Prokop defy the construction of the city\\", colors Prokop as a black hole in the city center and describes the project of the reconstruction of the Fran≈°e d'Eperea street (modern highway) which would include an artificial lake with many restaurants, foreseeing that Prokop will be the most beautiful part of Belgrade. In another reprint, Politika published its article from 1 April 1965 about Prokop titled New settlement on ƒåukarica will be built for the inhabitants of Prokop. In it, Prokop is depicted as the largest informal settlement in Belgrade which basically has no roads, grocery stores and is regularly being flooded during rains. Demolition of Prokop was scheduled for 1965 but had to be postponed and instead of the settlement, whose inhabitants were to be resettled to the neighborhood of ƒåukarica, a large garage and depot for Belgrade‚Äôs public transit company GSP Belgrade was to be built. Both projects were scrapped later. After several attempts, the last remains of Jatagan Mala were fully demolished in 1961. In February 1969 another relocation was announced. The municipality of Savski Venac obtained 270 apartments in the neighborhoods of ≈Ωarkovo and Kanarevo Brdo, so the moving of the population by the spring brought the closing of the slum section of the neighborhood, which was, at the time, one of the oldest surviving such parts of the city. The population of the modern local community was 2,710 in 1981, 2,467 in 1991, 2,103 in 2002 and 1,786 in 2011.  Railway station  The ill- fated construction of the new railway station which was supposed to replace the old one in Savamala has lasted for decades. The official work began in 1977, it was halted in the 1980s, resumed in the 1990s and halted again in 2000. Originally, in the late 1960s, it was supposed to be constructed near the present interchange of Autokomanda, but the idea was suddenly dropped, and one of the major authorities at the time, Branko ≈Ωe≈æelj, picked Prokop instead, which ultimately left the Autokomanda interchange unfinished. Despite constant attempts to build it and upgrade it, after years of starting and then halting works and bankrupted companies, Prokop railway station is still just one of a dozen secondary stations in Belgrade. After the Avala Tower was destroyed in NATO bombing of Serbia 1999, certain Russian companies offered to build a new, higher (300 meters) TV tower in Prokop. No one took it seriously so the news was mostly used for publicity purposes. The construction of the Belgrade Waterfront and track removal in Savamala restarted the construction of the station once again in December 2014. Energoprojekt AD was once again selected as the contracting company and was given nearly 26 million euros and 14 months to complete the construction. For the first time the deadline was kept and the station was officially opened on 26 January 2016.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on March 12, 2009. In the episode, Michael excitedly starts a Willy Wonka-inspired promotional gimmick providing discounts to customers who receive golden tickets, then tries to blame the idea on Dwight when the promotion appears to cost the company a large amount of money. In a B story, Kevin receives conflicting romantic advice from Andy, Jim and Pam. The episode was written by Mindy Kaling and directed by Randall Einhorn. It received mixed reviews from critics, and many criticized the selfishness and mean behavior of Michael Scott in the episode. According to Nielsen ratings, \\"Golden Ticket\\" was watched by 7.7 million overall viewers the week it aired. Synopsis Michael Scott (Steve Carell), inspired by the film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, decides to put five \\"golden tickets\\" randomly into five different boxes of paper that will provide Dunder Mifflin clients with a ten percent discount for one year. Michael is excited about the promotional gimmick, which prompts him to dress and act like Wonka throughout the day, and lectures the rest of the office for not coming up with good ideas. However, because Michael distributed all the tickets on the same day in the same small area of the warehouse, all five golden tickets go to their biggest client, the Blue Cross of Pennsylvania; because Michael did not specify \\"limit one per customer\\", the company is owed a fifty percent discount. As a result, the Scranton branch is expected to lose a significant amount of revenue which could shut down the branch, making everyone in the office upset with Michael. Michael tries to insist the golden ticket idea was not his to his employees, and throws out his Wonka costume. When angry Chief Financial Officer David Wallace (Andy Buckley) demands to know who is responsible, Michael claims Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) thought of the idea. Despite the fact that Dwight explains he was neither given candy nor movies as a child, Michael tries to convince Dwight to take the fall, insisting that Michael needs the job more than Dwight and that it would allow Dwight to focus more energy on his beet farm. Dwight becomes conflicted, not wanting to disappoint Michael. David Wallace comes to the Scranton branch and says that the client was so pleased with the discount that they decided to make the company their exclusive provider of office supplies. Grateful, David congratulates Dwight for the idea and after a moment's hesitation, Dwight accepts the credit. Michael is shocked and upset. The rest of the office, still angry at Michael for his near-disastrous idea, play along with Wallace's misunderstanding and congratulate Dwight. When David sets up a conference call with the marketing department so Dwight can explain his golden ticket promotion, Michael interrupts and goads Dwight into revealing the idea actually came from Michael. After much bickering between Michael and Dwight, a frustrated David leaves the office, appearing indifferent about the outcome. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) seeks advice from others in the office on how to start a relationship with Lynn (Lisa K. Wyatt), the woman he socialized with at the Valentine's Day singles mixer at the office. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), still upset from his recent broken engagement with Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey), suggests that Kevin should be mean to Lynn, providing only backhanded compliments and ignoring her calls. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) suggests he ask her out, but not immediately and take things slow. Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) suggests he ask her out immediately and not be afraid to express himself to her. When Lynn visits the office, Kevin said he has decided to simply tell her what exactly he is thinking. He tells her that she has a nice smile and he would like to take her out to dinner and a movie, which she accepts. Kevin then accidentally says \\"Nice...boobs\\", but Lynn seems flattered by the statement. Production The official The Office website included three cut scenes from \\"Golden Ticket\\". One 72-second clip includes Michael eavesdropping from the men's bathroom on Angela, Oscar, Kelly and Meredith, who discuss how unfairly Michael is treating Dwight in making him take the fall over the failed golden ticket promotion. Kelly also makes the remark, \\"I hope Dwight gets fired and they get a hot new guy to replace him,\\" to which Oscar replies, \\"Seriously.\\" In another 52-second scene, Michael asks Dwight to go on a stroll, but Dwight suggests turning it into a \\"power stroll\\", which he prepares Michael for by applying sunscreen to his face. And in a follow-up to the scene where workers discuss that Michael should be fired, a visibly angry and upset Michael confronts the office. When he says \\"Can any of you imagine this office without me?\\" everyone gleefully raises their hands, but Michael then asks them if they've thought about what kind of terrible person they could get to replace him; he then pointedly says that they could get someone who knows they don't actually need three accountants (Oscar, Kevin and Angela look visibly ashamed that Michael knew this going back to season 2's \\"Halloween\\" episode but has never taken any action about it) or someone who doesn't approve of romantic relationships and would transfer one or both people to separate branches (Jim and Pam in turn get this message and look thoughtful), and tells the office that they should mind what they're saying about him \\"when I'm hiding in the bathroom pretending to be pooping.\\" The NBC site also featured more than two minutes' worth of clips involving the subplot between Kevin and Lynne, including Andy discussing his new method of being mean to women while courting dates, in response to his recent failed engagement with Angela. Among the deleted scenes are Kevin telling Lynn he will be too busy for three weeks to talk to her and giving a backhanded compliment to her shirt, both at Andy's suggestion. Cultural references The golden ticket promotional gimmick, from which the episode receives its title, is a reference to the golden tickets from the 1964 Roald Dahl novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, as well as the 1971 and 2005 film adaptations of the book. Throughout the first half of the episode, Michael wears a purple suit and top hat similar to Willy Wonka, the character responsible for the promotion from which this episode takes its name. Blue Cross of Pennsylvania, the Dunder Mifflin client who receives the golden tickets, is a real-life division of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, an American health insurance company. After throwing away the Willy Wonka outfit, Michael wears a gray T-shirt advertising the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Pioneers, a minor-league arena football team. One of the excuses Michael uses to avoid David's phone calls is that he is attending an \\"Obama fashion show\\", a reference to U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. Dwight Schrute makes knock-knock jokes involving the KGB, the secret police and intelligence agency for the Soviet Union. Michael also makes a knock-knock joke involving Buddha, with the punch-line that Pam \\"buttah\\" (butter, pronounced like Buddha) a slice of bread. Gautama Buddha was a spiritual teacher in the South Asian country Nepal who founded the religion Buddhism. During an office meeting in which Michael asks his employees to come up with other golden ticket-like ideas, Andy suggests the breakfast cereal brand Golden Grahams and American sitcom The Golden Girls before confessing he does not understand the assignment. Reception In its original American broadcast on March 12, 2009, \\"Golden Ticket\\" was watched by 7.7 million overall viewers and received a Nielsen rating of 4.1 among adults aged between 18 and 49, despite directly competing with ABC's Grey's Anatomy and CBS's CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. For the week of March 9‚Äì15, the episode ranked number 10 among adults 18‚Äì49, within two shares of the time-period lead in that age group. \\"Golden Ticket\\" was number four among all programs in adults 18‚Äì34, behind Grey's Anatomy and the Tuesday and Wednesday editions of American Idol. In the 9 to 9:30 p.m. time slot, the episode also ranked number one among men 18‚Äì34 and men 18‚Äì49, tied with Grey's Anatomy for number one among the broadcast networks in adults 18‚Äì34, and tied with CSI for number two among adults 18‚Äì49. \\"Golden Ticket\\" received mixed reviews, with several reviewers criticized the selfish and mean behavior of Michael. In a New York magazine article entitled \\"Michael Finally Goes Too Far\\", Will Leitch describes it as \\"one of the funnier recent episodes\\", but found Michael's willingness to sell out Dwight unsettling: \\"Usually, when he's about to do something over-the-top (like plant drugs on Toby), he backs off at the last second. This time, he's willing to go all the way and sell out Dwight, his most loyal friend. It's a little jarring.\\" Leitch, however, said the sweetness of the subplot involving Kevin and Lynne offset some of the darker aspects of the episode, and praised several of the jokes including Michael's \\"Shoe-La-La\\" shoe store idea, Dwight's idea for a \\"Horse Boat\\" invention and the KGB knock- knock jokes. Kona Gallagher, of TV Squad, praised \\"Golden Ticket\\", especially the final act: \\"Between Michael's face and Dwight's conference call, the last ten minutes of this episode were absolutely golden.\\" Gallagher said the episode returned to \\"season one levels of Michael Scott stupidity\\", and particularly liked the way Dwight so readily accepted credit once the golden ticket promotion proved to be a success. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club gave \\"Golden Ticket\\" an A- grade and particularly praised Steve Carell's Willy Wonka impression and the way Michael tried to distance himself after the promotional idea went bad. Rabin said, \\"Tonight's episode lacked a certain gravity but it delivered the goods, comedy-wise.\\" He also pointed out that the script was technically illogical in that Michael pretended he did not come up with the golden ticket idea despite the documentary camera crew filming his earlier discussions about it. Entertainment Weekly writer Whitney Pastorek described the episode as \\"kind of cute tonight, and kind of flat in places, and kind of sad.\\" Pastorek said one of the most interesting aspects of \\"Golden Ticket\\" was the relationship between Michael and Dwight: \\"After their respective failed romances with Holly and Angela, Michael and Dwight may be coming to the awkward realization that the most successful relationship in either of their lives is with one another, and that may be causing a little tension.\\" Travis Fickett of IGN said \\"Golden Ticket\\" was a \\"solid offering\\", but felt it lacked any big moments and fit too much of a status quo mold he feels other recent episodes had fallen into.

It is distributed from India to Australia and contains about 24 species. Biology A queen caste does not exist in Diacamma. Unique to this genus, all workers emerge from cocoons with a pair of tiny innervated thoracic appendages (gemmae) that are homologous with wings. Mutilation leads to a permanent change in lifetime trajectory, because workers lacking gemmae never mate. This is unlike other queenless ants where workers establish a dominance hierarchy to regulate reproduction. In Diacamma only one worker retains her gemmae in each colony, she is the gamergate (mated egglaying worker), and she bites off the gemmae of newly emerged workers. Mutilation causes the degeneration of the neuronal connections between the sensory hairs on the gemma's surface and the central nervous system, and this may explain the irreversibility of modifications in individual behaviour.

As the field became more popular, scientists recognized that an international association would be useful in helping to propagate research among themselves. In 1962, Jordi Folch Pi and Heinrich Waelesch proposed the formation of a Provisional Organizing Committee to such a society. The committee eventually came into being in 1963 and had an international membership composed of scientists in the field.

It was established in 1831 and is one of the oldest public schools in the United States of America. History In 1868, the Latin and English High School (1831), later called the Brown High School (1851); the Putnam Free School (1838); and the Female High School (1843) merged to form the Consolidated High and Putnam School. In 1889, the name changed to Newburyport High School.Sixty-Fifth Edition of The Clipper Compass: A Student Handbook for 2005‚Äì2006 The current building, designed by architect Edwin Dodge, occupies the previous Mount Rural on High Street. The school has been renovated a number of times, with the most recent renovations completed around 2003. Today it is a grandiose building with a particularly grand entrance, retaining many of the Federalist architectural motifs it was built with. The hill it stands on continues to descend to the river, and the slope supports a residential area of colonial and nineteenth century buildings in good repair. The school colors are \\"crimson and olde gold\\" as stated in the student handbook, The Clipper's Compass. The school emblem is a clipper ship and its official song is \\"All Hail to Our Alma Mater.\\" The school has a student government for each class and it maintains a three-season athletic program, as well as an award-winning drama program. Concerning accreditation the handbook says: \\"Newburyport High School is an accredited member of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges and has met the evaluation requirements of the Commission on Public Secondary Schools.\\" The current site of Newburyport High School was purchased from Alice Atkinson in 1935, and the deed recorded at the Southern Essex County Registry of Deeds as Book 3030, Page 279 in March 1935. Newburyport High School is one of the oldest public high schools in the United States.

Roquelin is most notable for her songs which won Best Music Video at several film festivals and received TV and Film Placements: \\"I Saw You\\", \\"Blues Alone\\", \\"Should You Get Mad\\", \\"Renew\\", \\"Keep This For You\\", \\"The Only One\\", \\"Thank You\\", \\"Like a Feather\\". Biography Roquelin was born in Toulon, France, and grew up on The French Riviera (known in French as La C√¥te d'Azur), learning music at a very young age. She played several gigs as a teenager, both solo and in various bands. She then left France to pursue a career in the United States. She first moved to Cleveland-Akron, Northeast Ohio area and fronted Phizzy Lager and then the alternative hard-rock Kent, Ohio band Hate Dies Hard, and released with them in 2006 an album entitled Neverending Sundown and engineered by Bill Korecky (Mushroomhead's Producer). After the album's release and promotion, Roquelin was introduced to producer Sean Bilovecky (Disengage), who infused the sounds of trip hop with a piano riff in their collaboration song \\"I Saw You\\". Later that year, Roquelin moved to New York City. The music video for \\"I Saw You\\" was included in her self-titled EP and became a winner for Best Music Video at the Queens (NY) International Film Festival in November 2008 and Best Music Video at the 2009 Indie Gathering Film Festival. Roquelin recruited Marc Urselli, a three-time Grammy Award-winning engineer to mix and master the recordings from her EP and launched an online crowdfunding campaign to help cover the expenses of the EP, a recording of down-tempo, trip hop songs composed by Roquelin with her lyrics moving between English and French accompanied by her piano arrangements. \\"Blues Alone\\" received an Honorable Mention at the 2009 John Lennon Songwriting Contest. Roquelin released a full- length album Will you hate the rest of the world or will you renew your life? and a music video for Should You Get Mad in February 2010. The video was directed by Arnaud Muller (U2) at RNO Pictures and was in the official selection of ZFF Film Festival (London, Miami, LA). It received the award of 2nd Place for Best Music Video in pop category at the 2010 Indie Gathering Film Festival and Convention. The album also includes a cover of Danny Elfman's \\"Sally's Song\\" (from Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas)https://insidethemagic.net/2018/10/jack-skellington-nightmare- before-christmas-celebrates/ in French. Her influences are The Beatles, Radiohead, Noel Gallagher, and Ingrid Michaelson; she has performed at One Penn Plaza in NYC for the 9-11 commemoration and has played various venues including The Bitter End in NYC. Lifetime's show Dance Moms used Roquelin's song \\"Renew\\" for a dance routine entitled \\"Sinful\\" (season 1, episode 9, first air-date 09/07/11). The show used another of her songs \\"Keep This For You\\" for a Hunger Games-inspired dance routine called \\"The Huntress\\" on Dance Moms season 2 episode 17 - Lifetime (first aired on 06/26/2012). At the end of June 2012, LiLi Roquelin was working on finishing up her 3rd solo studio album. Her previous records landed her diverse placements in documentaries and films such as the soundtrack of Attack of La Nina by Matchstick Productions. LiLi Roquelin released a new album \\"Beautiful Sun\\" in December 2012. On 31 January 2013 she premiered the music video for her song \\"Thank You\\" which appeared on her YouTube page the next day. There is also a mini-documentary on the making of \\"Beautiful Sun\\". Her music on \\"Beautiful sun\\" melds the two worlds of adult contemporary and exploratory pop. The songs are described as Blue, jazz- influenced trip hop (title track), gritty-guitar progressive arrangement (\\"Try to remember\\"), minor key pop song with inflections of the blues (\\"Don't Wait\\"), recalling the works of Sarah McLachlan, Kate Bush, Tori Amos. Some of the musicians on \\"Beautiful Sun\\" are cellist Christopher Marion, guitarist and bassist Askold Buk (Hayley Westenra, Hugh Masekela). She composed and arranged all of the music on the album and recruited Grammy winning mixing engineer Marc Urselli and Roman Vail, mastering engineer at JLM Mastering Studios (Moby, Sinead O'Connor, The Black Crowes). Her song \\"Blues Alone\\", off her self-titled solo EP (2008), was her third featured track on Lifetime's show Dance Moms (\\"Return to Grace\\", season 3 episode 14, first aired 2 April 2013) for the main group dance routine. Dance Moms has a strong fan-base and ratings of 2 to 3 million viewers per episode. The album \\"Beautiful Sun\\" has gathered media attention, such as The Los Angeles Examiner and a whole page review in east-coast paper The Aquarian Weekly with her name featured on the cover, and written by award-winning music critics John Pfeiffer. In September 2013 Roquelin was welcomed by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (The GRAMMYs) as a Voting Member. On 26 September 2013, LiLi Roquelin was invited to perform God Bless America at a corporate event at the elegant Terrace on the Park in New York City. Six-hundred people attended, including NY1, WNYW FOX5, New York Mayoral Candidate Joe Lhota and more. On 21 November 2013 she premiered her new music video for \\"The Only One\\" at a Music & Film event that she presented. It is a one-shot music video where Roquelin walks down a path while various men appear around her. At the end of the video, the guy she runs into turns out to be 'The One'. It was directed by Kyle Lavore, who has worked on films like The Amazing Spider-Man and Men in Black III. \\"The Only One\\" is track number 5 on album \\"Beautiful Sun\\", a Rock song with alternative guitars, inspired in part by her past Rock music experience. On 2 May 2014 she performed as the opening act for Bruce Sudano (producer for Michael Jackson, Dolly Parton and his wife Donna Summer) at The Bitter End. During the summer of 2014 her Music Video \\"The Only One\\" screened at several Film Festivals: Rahway International Short Film Festival, Art All Night Trenton International Film Festival, 7th Annual Hamilton Music and Film Festival in Hamilton, Canada (Sept 28th), and at the 19th International Indie Gathering Festival where it was awarded \\"Best Pop Music Video\\".

On 16 September 2014 she released a Hip-Hop Remix of her song \\"Bliss of My Soul\\" featuring Bronx Native Rap Artist R.e.a.P. The track was remixed by Titus and mastered by Roman Vail at JLM Studios. R.e.a.P is also a Songwriter, Producer, and Engineer who worked at JAMBOX Entertainment with Pitbull (rapper), Ludacris, Nina Sky, Torch (American rapper) from Maybach Music Group (MMG), Idris Elba, and Hurricane Chris.

In December 2014 Roquelin released a new Music Video \\"Like a Feather\\" animated by Indie Venture with footage directed by Patrick Jung. The video was shown at a private Music, Film and Animation event that she presented in New York City with support from Asifa-East (International Animated Film Association, East Coast Chapter). In March 2015 she released an indie-pop single entitled \\"Smile\\". The uplifting song is the result of a collaboration between Roquelin (vocals, lyrics, vocal arrangements and music) and accomplished film composer, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter Peter Lobo (drums, guitar, bass, piano, arrangements, music and production). Lobo has worked with such artists as Dawn Robinson (En Vogue), Yoko Ono, Whitney Houston, The Dave Matthews Band, Ziggy Marley, Blues Traveler and Marc DeSisto (Pink Floyd and U2). \\"Thank You\\" by LiLi Roquelin is used for a solo dance routine, themed \\"The Woods\\" and performed by International Dancing Star Maddie Ziegler, also known as the Dancer for Sia Furler. It won 1st Place/ 1st Overall at the Sheer Talent Dance Competition at Spokane Convention Center in Washington State on 05/16/15 and aired on Dance Moms Season 5 Episode 29 on Lifetime on 28 July 2015. Maddie also performed the same number on 30 May at the Abby Lee Dance Company Los Angeles School Grand Opening and on 20 June at ALDC's Annual Showcase in Pittsburgh. In November 2015 she wrote and released a song \\"Abolitionistas\\" produced by Titus, exclusively for Freedom Ladder, a non-profit organization which focuses on ending the trafficking of children. The Director of Freedom Ladder has been chosen as one of the New York Abolitionists just like Tina Fey and Michael Bloomberg. The alternate version of the Song is called \\"Liberty\\". Her \\"Like a Feather\\" Music Video was in the official selection of several Film Festivals, it received a Nomination for Best Short Film at the Golden Door International Film Festival and won \\"Rising Star Award\\" at the 11th Canada International Film Festival in April 2016.

In March, Roquelin launched a special \\"Every Other Monday Video\\" Playlist on her popular YouTube channel, with cover performance videos of such classics as \\"Dreams\\" (Fleetwood Mac), \\"Breathe Me\\" (Sia), \\"I've Got this Friend\\" (The Civil Wars), \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" (The Beatles), and a fan-favorite Ukulele cover of The Offspring's \\"Why don't you get a Job\\". She also plays the ukulele on her new performance video called \\"Petunia's Song\\" (September 2016), and describes her album in the works as having a different mood, being more upbeat but still with a lot of piano. In April 2017 she performed new songs at a fundraising event at The Bitter End to help raise awareness and funds for Suicide Prevention and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.http://heyevent.co.za/event/pvfbpambwk6nga/q-hosts-echoes-of-love- raising-funds-for-suicide-prevention-with-music In July 2018 her song \\"Don't You Know It's Christmas\\" (released December 2017) won Best Holiday Song Award at the American Songwriting Awards.https://americansongwritingawards.com/winners Roquelin released a new album \\"Be Inspired\\" on 6 December 2018, with a red-carpet event and live performance at The Bitter End in New York City with a band.https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/LiLi-Roquelins-New-Album- BE-INSPIRED-Celebrates-Red-Carpet-Release- Party-20181120https://frenchmorning.com/lili-roquelin-concert-a-the-bitter- end/ She also released a Documentary offering a behind the scenes look into the work she put into producing the record.

She defines it as \\"a holiday song that's for everybody, a cute story to remind people that life is not just about working but enjoying that special time of the year\\" and that it's \\"not focused on religious lyrics\\". She wrote it on the ukulele with a bright tone making it \\"a great transition from her previous music into her new album\\". She selected and directed a total of 12 people while creating and managing the entire album: she wrote, composed, arranged the songs, recorded the vocals, piano and synths, directed the musicians, the mixing and mastering engineers. Brian Scheuble (Elton John, Sheryl Crow, Liz Phair) mixed the albumhttps://www.rockawave.com/articles/power-to-move-you/ and Grammy-nominated Joe Lambert (Moby, Sinead O'Connor) was the mastering engineer.https://wsbs.com/lili-roquelin-returns-to-the-wsbs- airwaves/https://przen.com/pr/lili-roquelin-releases-new-album-be-inspired- with-red-carpet-event-przen-33280095 She mentioned she came across the idea many times that \\"to make a good album or get some credibility a woman has to hide herself behind the name of a well-known male producer\\". She stated that \\"less than 10% of record producers are women and this can be intimidating for girls so she wants to inspire all the women songwriters that if they have a vision they can do it too, that it takes hard work and learning a lot of different skills, to not believe anyone that tells them that they cannot do it, to be firm and a great communicator when directing a team and making requests, and that when they work with the right people they will get the respect that they deserve\\".https://www.qgazette.com/articles/local- express-262/ In June 2019, she performed the American National Anthem at Citi Field, New York Mets.

At the Moscow State Institute of Performing Arts, Oskooyi specialized in direction (1955) and art criticism (1990). While studying, he had already embarked on his practical stage work which covered a period of 50 years. Career During the 1940s, Oskooyi rose to become the leading actor in the progressive theatrical movement setting the pace for Iranian theatre under the leadership of Noushin in the Tehran, Farhang and Ferdousi theatres. His major contributions in numerous productions came with his return from Europe in 1958 at a time when Iranian theatre was on the decline. Oskooyi methods fundamentally changed the performing arts in Iran, with the first five years of this work (1959-1964 ) in particular leading to a change in the standing of art society. This eventually lead to the formation of the Iranian Ministry of Art and Culture. After the Revolution of 1979, Oskooyi was elected to the presidency of the National Centre for Iranian Theatre and was re-elected for each of the three successive two year terms. As professor, he penned numerous theoretical works, theses, and articles, and elevated theatre to an academic discipline for research. Education * 1942 ‚Äì Theatre School, Tehran * 1956 ‚Äì A.V.

Biography He was born in Bunzlau in Silesia (now Boles≈Çawiec, Poland), the third son of a miller. He studied at the Gymnasium in Sagan (now ≈ªaga≈Ñ) from 1852 to 1862, and then attended the Berlin Theological School, where he obtained his licentiate in 1866. He then taught at the Berlin School of Religion, teaching Hebrew and German to the upperclassmen and Latin and Greek to the younger students. From 1867 to 1868 he taught at the Dorotheenst√§dtische Realgymnasium, then at the Luisenst√§dtische Realschule until 1875. From then until 1904 he taught at the Humboldtgymnasium, first as Oberlehrer and after 1882 as Professor. In 1904, due to poor health, the Prussian Ministry of Education forced him to retire with a pension.Hans E. Mayer, \\"Der Prophet und sein Vaterland: Leben und Nachleben von Reinhold R√∂hricht.\\" In Laudem Hierosolymitani: Studies in Crusades and Medieval Culture in Honour of Benjamin Z. Kedar, ed. Iris Shagrir, Ronnie Ellenblum, Jonathan Riley-Smith, Benjamin Z. Kedar (Ashgate, 2007), p. 241. Mayer notes also that due to his vast amount of publications, he may have been an inattentive professor, and the Prussian government may have used his illness as an excuse to retire him. The pension was the same as that given to any other Gymnasium professor, and although it was surprising to others who were aware of R√∂hricht's fame and importance, he himself \\"ne sollicita point les hommages et ne rechercha pas les profitables honneures\\".\\"Chroniques\\", Revue de l'Orient latin 10 (1904‚Äì1905), p. 547. He died the next year. Crusade historian As Hans E. Mayer says, R√∂hricht was \\"an antiquarian rather than a historian\\", but nevertheless laid the \\"foundation of all modern crusade research\\".Hans E. Mayer, \\"America and the Crusades\\", Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 125, No. 1 (1981), p. 41, n. 21. According to his obituary in The American Historical Review, \\"his most important work was almost wholly on the crusades, the eight main works published since 1874 comprising probably the most important contribution by any one scholar in this field.\\"\\"Notes and News\\", The American Historical Review 11, No. 1 (1905), p. 205. \\"Nul aujourd'hui\\", wrote the Revue de l'Orient latin, \\"ne pourrait occuper avec les m√™mes titres et la m√™me autorit√© qui lui la grande place qu'il laissera vide dans le domaine sp√©cial de nos √©tudes.\\"Revue de l'Orient latin, p. 543. His scholarly reputation was such that in 1940 American historian John L. La Monte described his Geschichte des K√∂nigreichs Jerusalem as \\"a masterful history which left little to be desired\\", although it was written in \\"ponderous German\\"; La Monte favoured it in comparison to the recently published French history by Ren√© Grousset.John L. La Monte, \\"Some Problems in Crusading Historiography\\", Speculum 15, No. 1 (1940), p. 58. Although the Geschichte is now out of date, R√∂hricht's other magnum opus, the Regesta Regni Hierosolymitani, remains useful to modern crusade historians; it is a collection of over nine hundred charters and other documents issued from the royal chancery of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which, until edited and published by R√∂hricht, had remained scattered throughout dozens of other medieval cartularies. He was also the first historian to collect all the medieval material pertaining to the Fifth Crusade. Bibliotheca Geographica Palaestinae Among the books on Palestine.

The film was shot in 18 days. Plot summary Nick Taylor was once a champion in the sport of kickboxing. However, when the brutal Jake Gerard defeats him, Nick not only loses the title, but he also loses his wife Roxy to Gerard. Nick now spends his time drinking and reminiscing about his heavy loss. However, one day, a young upstart from Ohio has arrived. His name is Danny Davis and he wants Nick to train him. Nick is not sure Danny has what it takes to prove himself, so Nick takes him to a club with a kickboxing ring, hires a fellow kickboxer and tells him to face Danny. Danny is able to defeat Nick's fighter and tells Nick he's invincible. The next day, Nick tests Danny himself and, when Danny fails, Nick tells him 'nobody is invincible', but he offers to train him. As Danny and Nick begin to train, a bond strengthens between the two. Nick's somewhat unstable relationship with local waitress Maggie also begins to get better. Nick finally finds himself in a comfortable place as he gets Danny ready for an upcoming tournament to determine who will become the next World Champion in Las Vegas. As Danny begins to win matches, Nick becomes proud of himself as a mentor. However, when Jake arrives with Roxy, the two play mind games with Nick. Nick slowly begins to regress again while training Danny. When Nick decides enough is enough, he challenges Jake to a fight on a rooftop. However, Jake decimates Nick to the point where Nick ends up in the hospital fighting for his life. In the hospital, Nick talks to Danny and Maggie, expressing his regret for what he had done and wishes Danny the best in the finals against Jake. Shortly after that, Nick dies in his hospital bed. At the finals of the World Championships, Jake overpowers Danny at first. However, with Maggie's full support and remembering his training with Nick, Danny finally defeats Jake with a series of kicks, ranging from a side kick to numerous roundhouses, and ending it with a flying wushu-style half-butterfly kick, knocking Jake out. Danny wins the championship and both he and Maggie look at each other and smile as Danny gets the title belt, celebrating his victory.

Beginning with the New England Colonies, the name \\"New Englander\\" refers to those who live in the six New England states or those with cultural or family ties to the region. Originally inhabited by Algonquin American Indians, including tribes Abenakis, Mi'kmaq, Penobscot, Pequots, Mohegans, Narragansetts, Pocumtucks, and Wampanoag. The region was first settled by European colonists from the Mayflower as part of the Plymouth Company in 1620. The region has seen many different waves of immigration since 1620, creating a unique and diverse culture. New Englanders have played a prominent role in the colonial and modern history of the United States, from political dynasties to influential artists and writers. Famous for their distinct dialect and attitude,http://www.telegram.com/article/20081030/NEWS/810300459 New Englanders hold a strong regional identity and a distinct history and culture within the United States. Terminology The region was named \\"New England\\" by English explorer John Smith in 1616.Cressy, David (1987). Coming Over: Migration and Communication Between England and New England in the Seventeenth Century. p. 4. Cambridge University Press. While the term \\"New Englander\\" can refer to anyone who resides in New England or has cultural ties to the region, the term \\"Native New Englander\\" refers to those New Englanders who were born in the region. Another term to refer to those who live in New England is \\"Yankee\\". Depending on the context Yankee may refer to all Americans in general, but in the colloquial American context, it refers to those who live in the Northeastern United States and even more specifically New England. Originally employed to describe New Englanders with ancestral roots to the original English settlers, the term has evolved throughout American history to have a variety of contextual meanings. Demography Largest self-reported ancestry groups in New England. Americans of Irish descent form a plurality in most of Massachusetts and Americans of English descent form a plurality in much of the central parts of Vermont and New Hampshire as well as nearly all of Maine. Boston is considered the cultural and historical capital of New England.Philip Emerson, The geography of New England (1922) pp. 51‚Äì56; Laura Purdom and Robert Holmes, Traveler's Companion New England (3rd ed. 2002) p. 77 According to the 2018 American Community Survey, New England had an estimated population of 14,853,290, of which 48.7% were male and 51.3% were female. Approximately 19.7% of the population were under 18 years of age; 17.4% were 65 years of age or over. In terms of race and ethnicity, White Americans made up 80.7% of New England's population, of which 74.4% were whites of non-Hispanic origin. Black Americans comprised 7.1% of the region's population, of which 6.4% were blacks of non-Hispanic origin. Native Americans made up 0.3% of the population, numbering 43,917. There were over 650,000 Asian Americans residing in New England at the time of the survey, making up 5.0% of the region's population. There were over 240,000 Chinese Americans, constituting 1.6% of the region's total population, and over 212,000 Indian Americans (1.4%).Monica Chiu, ed. Asian Americans in New England: Culture and Community (University of New Hampshire Press, 2009) 252 pp. Pacific Islander Americans numbered 5,794, or 0.04% of the populace. Aside from scattered areas in Florida and New York, New England is one of the only regions in the country where Blacks of recent immigrant origin outnumber Blacks of multigenerational American origin, on a 60 to 40 ratio. Though various groups of Caribbean Blacks can be seen throughout New England, the most notable is a large Haitian population in the Boston metropolitan area and a large Jamaican population in Connecticut, especially around Hartford. New England has about 250,000 people of non-Hispanic Caribbean origin, the majority made up of Haitians and Jamaicans, with smaller numbers of other groups such as Bajans, Bahamians, Trinidadians etc. African groups include Liberians and Cape Verdeans both heavily around Boston and Providence, as well as smaller numbers of people from various other parts of West Africa and North Africa now living in the Boston area and southwest Connecticut close to New York City. The Boston metropolitan area and Southwest Connecticut tend to be the most diverse areas in New England in regards to large variety of ethnic minorities. Multiracial Americans made up 3.1% of New England's population. The largest mixed-race group comprised those of African and European descent; there were over 171,000 people of black and white ancestry, making up 1.2% of the population. People of mixed Native American and European American ancestry made up 0.4% of the population, and people of Asian and European heritage 0.6%. The majority of the Hispanic/Latino population is made up of multiracials, however not counted in some identify forms such as the United States Census because some may not identify as such or sometimes some government agencies separate Hispanics as a separate race. New England, especially Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts, also has large Cape Verdean and Brazilian populations, who are also made up of European/African multiracials similar to Hispanics of Caribbean origin like Dominicans and Puerto Ricans. Hispanic and Latino Americans are New England's largest minority, and they are the second-largest group in the region behind non-Hispanic European Americans. Hispanics and Latinos of any race made up 11.4% of New England's population, and there were nearly 1.7 million Hispanic and Latino individuals reported in the survey. Puerto Ricans were the most numerous of the Hispanic and Latino subgroups. Over 710,000 Puerto Ricans live in New England, forming 4.8% of the population. There are also over 281,000 Dominicans, forming 1.9% of New England's population, and nearly 137,000 Mexican Americans. People of other Hispanic and Latino ancestries, for example Colombian, Salvadoran, Guatemalan, and Cuban, among many others, formed 3.2% of New England's population, and numbered over 484,000. Southern New England has some of the highest concentrations of both Puerto Ricans and Dominicans. Southeast New England, composed of Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts, and dominated by the Boston metropolitan area, has a Dominican plurality among its Hispanic/Latino community, but also large numbers of other Hispanics. Boston is one of the only major cities with a Dominican-dominant Hispanic population, and Rhode Island has the highest percentage of Dominicans of any US state. Southwest New England, composed of Connecticut and western Massachusetts, and geared more towards the New York City area, has a Puerto Rican majority among its Hispanic/Latino community, while also having sizable numbers of other Hispanics. Cities like Springfield, Holyoke, Hartford, New Haven, and Bridgeport have some of the highest percentages of Puerto Ricans in the country, with Connecticut having the highest percentage out of all US states. New England's European American population is ethnically diverse. The majority of the Euro-American population is of Irish, Italian, French, or English descent. Smaller but significant populations of Germans, Poles, and Portuguese descent exist as well. New England is well-known for its large Irish and Italian populations, having the highest percentages of these groups in the country, especially the southern half of New England. Half of the population of Rhode Island in particular, is of Irish or Italian origin. People of French and Portuguese origin also make up large portions of the New England population. According to the 2018 survey, the top ten largest European ancestries were: * Irish: 17.5% (2.6 million) * Italian: 12.3% (1.8 million) * French or French Canadian: 11.5% 1.7 million * English: 10.5% (1.6 million) * German: 6.5% (966,000) * Polish: 4.6% (676,000) * Portuguese: 3.0% (441,000) * Scottish: 2.4% (348,000) * Swedish: 1.5% (226,000) * Russian: 1.2% (175,000) Language English is, by far, the most common language spoken at home. As of 2018, approximately 80.4% of all residents (11.1 million people) over the age of five spoke only English at home. Roughly 1.2 million people (8.4% of the population) spoke Spanish at home, and roughly 1.0 million people (7.1% of the population) spoke other Indo-European languages at home. Over 418,000 people (3.0% of the population) spoke an Asian or Pacific Island language at home. Fewer than 150,000 people (about 1%) spoke French at home, although this figure is above 20% in some parts of northern New England, which borders francophone Qu√©bec. Roughly 156,000 people (1.1% of the population) spoke languages other than these at home. Population As of 2018, the vast majority of New England's inhabitants, roughly 12.8 million people or 86.4% of the population, are U.S. natives. Of these, 259,000 were born in Puerto Rico, and over 145,000 were born abroad to American parents. The foreign-born population of 2.0 million forms 13.6% of New England's total population. 38.9% of foreigners were born in Latin America, 28.5% were born in Asia, 20.4% were born in Europe, and 8.2% were born in Africa. People born in other parts of North America made up 3.6% of the foreign-born populace. Oceania-born residents formed 0.4% of the foreign population, over 7,000. Of the 2.0 million foreigners, the majority (54.4%) were naturalized citizens of the U.S. The six states of New England have the lowest birth rate in the U.S.https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr59/nvsr59_01.pdf In 2018, the New England population of 14.85 million was roughly an 80% increase from its 1930 population of 8.2 million. The region's average population density is 236.9 inhabitants/sq mi (91.5/km2), although a great disparity exists between its northern and southern portions. The population density is much greater than that of the U.S. as a whole (86.2/sq mi) or even just the contiguous 48 states (108.6/sq mi). Three-quarters of the population of New England, and most of the major cities, are in the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. Their combined population density is 839.7/sq mi, compared to northern New England's 67.1/sq mi (2018 estimates). The most populous state is Massachusetts, and the most populous city is Massachusetts' political and cultural capital, Boston. The coastline is more urban than the western parts of the region, which are typically rural, even in urban states like Massachusetts. This is due mainly to historical factors; the original colonists settled mostly near the coastline of Massachusetts Bay. The only New England state without access to the Atlantic Ocean, Vermont, is also the least urbanized. After nearly 400 years, the region still maintains, for the most part, its historical population layout. New England's coast is dotted with urban centers, such as Portland, Portsmouth, Boston, New Bedford, Fall River, Providence, New Haven, Bridgeport, and Stamford, as well as smaller cities such as Newburyport, Gloucester, Biddeford, Bath, Rockland, Newport, Westerly, and the small twin cities of Groton and New London in Connecticut. Southern New England forms an integral part of the BosWash megalopolis, a conglomeration of urban centers that spans from Boston to Washington, D.C. The region includes three of the four most densely populated states in the U.S.; only New Jersey has a higher population density than the states of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. Greater Boston, which includes parts of southern New Hampshire, has a total population of approximately 4.4 million,U.S. Census Bureau ‚Äì Metropolitan and micropolitan statistical area population and estimated components of change: April 1, 2000, to July 1, 2006 while over half the population of New England falls inside Boston's Combined Statistical Area of over 7.4 million. In 2009, two New England states were among the five highest in the U.S. in divorce rates. Maine was second highest with 13.6% of people over the age of 15 divorced; Vermont was fifth with 12.6% divorced. Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, on the other hand, have below-average divorce rates. Massachusetts is tied with Georgia with the lowest divorce rate in the U.S., at 2.4%. Largest cities Providence claims the largest contiguous area of National Register of Historic Places-listed buildings in the U.S. Worcester is the second largest city (by population) in New England, as of the 2010 census The most populous cities are as of the 2010 Census (metropolitan areas in parentheses): # Boston, Massachusetts: 617,594 (4,552,402) # Worcester, Massachusetts: 181,045 (798,552) # Providence, Rhode Island: 178,042 (1,600,852) # Springfield, Massachusetts: 153,060 (692,942) # Bridgeport, Connecticut: 144,229 (916,829) # New Haven, Connecticut: 129,779 (862,477) # Stamford, Connecticut: 125,109 (part of Bridgeport's MSA) # Hartford, Connecticut: 124,775 (1,212,381) # Waterbury, Connecticut: 110,366 (228,984) # Manchester, New Hampshire: 109,565 (400,721) # Lowell, Massachusetts: 106,519 (315,158) # Cambridge, Massachusetts: 105,162 (part of Greater Boston) During the 20th century, urban expansion in regions surrounding New York City has become an important economic influence on neighboring Connecticut, parts of which belong to the New York Metropolitan Area. The U.S. Census Bureau groups Fairfield, New Haven and Litchfield counties in western Connecticut together with New York City, and other parts of New York and New Jersey as a combined statistical area. Health The six states of New England ranked within the top thirteen \\"healthiest states\\" of the U.S. in 2007. In 2008, they all placed within the top eleven states. New England also had the largest proportion of its population covered by health insurance. For 2006, four states in the region, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, joined 12 others nationwide, where the number of deaths caused by drugs had overtaken traffic fatalities. This was due in part to declining traffic fatalities, and in part to increased deaths caused by prescription drugs. Data from 2008 comparing national obesity rates by state, four of the six lowest obesity states were Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont and Rhode Island. New Hampshire and Maine had the 15th and 18th lowest obesity rates, making New England the least overweight part of the U.S. In 2008, three of New England's states had the fewest uninsured motorists (out of the top five states); Massachusetts ‚Äì 1%, Maine ‚Äì 4%, and Vermont ‚Äì 6%. In 2006, Massachusetts adopted health care reform that requires nearly all state residents obtain health insurance,Fahrenthold, David A. (April 5, 2006), \\"Mass. Bill Requires Health Coverage\\", The Washington Post, p. A01. Retrieved December 6, 2006. which served as an important model for the federal 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Nursing home care can be expensive in the region. A private room in Connecticut averaged $125,925 annually. A one-bedroom in an assisted living facility averaged $55,137 in Massachusetts. Both are national highs.  References  Further reading * Chiu, Monica, ed.

Erna Hanfstaengl (1885‚Äì1981) was the elder sister of Ernst (\\"Putzi\\") Hanfstaengl and was an acquaintance of Adolf Hitler.See Erna as a girl: a portrait of Erna as a young girl, painted by Franz von Defregger and dated 1890. Hitler was born in 1889 so apparently Erna was about four years older than Hitler and about two years older than her brother Ernst (known as \\"Putzi\\"), who was born in 1887). See also (\\"Conradi\\")(stating that Erna was born in 1885) See, e.g., Time Magazine, March 9, 1936 (\\"Let's Be Friends\\")(identifying Erna Hanfstaengl as an acquaintance of Hitler due to Hitler's friendship with her brother \\"Putzy\\" ). She also befriended Unity Mitford, who lived with Erna for a period.In the spring of 1939, Unity (always short of money) moved in with Erna. At Erna's request, Unity asked Hitler (during lunch) if he would meet with Erna, whose objective was to reconcile Putzi (who had fled Germany in fear of his life) with Hitler. Hitler agreed and met with Erna in private, later taking tea with both Unity and Erna. (\\"Lovell\\")After a complicated episode in which Erna later sought to use Unity as an intermediary to collect Putzi's back pay after he fled Germany in fear of his life, Hitler became furious at the \\"money-grubbing Hanfstaengls\\" and ordered Unity to move out of Erna's house immediately; Unity was reportedly terrified by this command (and by Hitler's attendant fury) and did so promptly. She was reluctant even to contact Erna after her conversation with Hitler, and did so at first through an intermediary. She later that day had her things retrieved from Erna's house by a friend and spent the night in a hotel. Conradi, pp. 231-232. Lovell, p. 285. Erna at one time warned Unity to be more discreet in repeating and spreading idle Nazi party gossip that she heard, accusing Unity of acting as if the party were an operetta. Conradi, p. 204. Romantic involvement with Hitler Hitler may have been romantically involved with Erna, who was reported to have been beautiful, charming, cultured and intelligent. In the days following the failed Beer Hall putsch, it was rumored that Hitler and Erna had sex while the former was hiding at a country house in Uffing.See (\\"Large\\")Konrad Heiden, an early Hitler biographer, even repeats these rumors as factual in his historical work. These fantastic stories are clearly false, as Hitler was seriously injured in the putsch and was in no shape for such activities.Ernst Hanfstaengl also refutes these rumors in his memoirs. Rumors circulated in Munich in 1923 that Hitler and Erna were to be engaged; in the spring of 1923, the most widely read newspaper in Munich, the M√ºnchener Neuste Nachrichten, published a story to this effect.Conradi, p. 51. The story was completely false, but Hitler found it rather flattering and seemed pleased with the rumor. Hitler's response to the press inquiries was that his only true bride was, and would always be, the German people -- a rather clear allusion to Jesus Christ. It appears that the \\"tall and stately\\" Erna had simply been polite to Hitler and had shown courtesy to her brother's friend at their initial meeting in the early 1920s, and Hitler misinterpreted this as romantic affection. Gross claims that Hitler was in love with Erna, but that she considered the whole business to be a joke, and that she was amused at his attempts to court her. According to Gross, she was teased by her society friends about the unwanted affections shown by her \\"suitor\\" and made sure that she was never alone with him.Gross, p. 9-12. In any event it appears that during the period 1922-23, Erna assisted her brother in his aspirations to become one of Hitler's inner circle, by furthering Hitler's introduction to people of wealth and social standing in Munich.She held coffee parties for Hitler in her home. Several writers claim that, years later, Geli Raubal, Hitler's niece (and possibly his lover for a period, although many authoritiesThere is a vast amount of speculation on the Hitler-Geli relationship. See, e.g., Sage, infra at p. 139 (\\"gossips could only guess\\" as to whether they actually made love); (The thesis of Machtan's book is that Hitler was homosexual) Christa Schroeder, one of Hitler's personal secretaries, was convinced that Geli and Hitler did not have sexual relations, Ibid; one of Geli's friends and daughter of Hitler's photographer Heinrich Hoffmann, Henrietta von Schirach, was also confident that the two did not have sexual relations, But see the conclusions by psychoanalyst Walter C. Langer in The Mind of Adolf Hitler, which are largely followed by Hitler historians Waite and Victor (Hitler's sexual relationship with Geli was coprophagic or coprophiliac, ultimately based on his masochism). Toland states, rather paradoxically, that the \\"discreet love affair\\" between Hitler and Geli was \\"most likely never consummated,\\" Other historians, like Kershaw, simply decline to take a position on the ground that the matter is simply too speculative. See (identifying three versions of the Hitler-Geli sexual relationship issue, i.e. (a) they were sexually intimate, (b) they were not sexually intimate and (c) Hitler enticed Geli to engage in sexual perversions that contributed to her suicide) doubt their relationship was consummated) was jealous of Hitler's association with Erna.Gross, p. 9-11. Plot against Hitler According to Heinrich Himmler's personal aide and special- plenipotentiary Walter Schellenberg, Erna was also involved in a plot to overthrow Hitler and to sue for peace with the Allies. (\\"Doerries\\") Erna owned a shop in Munich in 1943, and Schellenberg made her acquaintance in March 1943 at Himmler's suggestion. Himmler's wife and Erna were acquainted, and Frau Himmler had suggested to her husband that Erna would be a suitable person to conduct peace negotiations with the English, perhaps because she knew \\"people of influence\\" such as Randolph Churchill.Unity Mitford had introduced Erna to Randolph, who reportedly commented that she must visit his father while she was in London. There is no evidence, however, that Erna ever actually met Winston Churchill. Lovell, pp. 284-85. Her peace plan consisted of having Himmler (with the aid of the Waffen SS) abduct Hitler to the Obersalzberg, where he would be held in SS detention. This would allow for the use of the cover story that Hitler was still in control of the government, since he spent much time at Obersalzberg anyway. A Council of Twelve would then constitute the de facto government, with Himmler at the head. Erna would then open an art shop in Paris and proceed to open secret negotiations with persons of influence in England, such as Randolph Churchill, whom she claimed to know. Erna traveled to Paris twice in support of this plan and made contacts, including a former commandant of the French police. Schellenberg and Erna met several times during 1943. He advanced her 500,000 French francs to establish her art-shop cover in Paris, which she did. Nothing, however, came of the plot, and Schellenberg claimed that he himself would not have engaged an agent such as Erna Hanfstaengl, save for the insistence of Himmler.Frau Himmler apparently was insistent; Schellenberg reported that he considered Erna to be too volatile and emotional for cloak-and-dagger work. Doerries, p. 116. In May 1944, at Himmler's direction, Schellenberg ceased any further usage of Erna Hanfstaengl as a possible agent for peace negotiations. Schellenberg reportedly objected to her termination as an agent and argued with Himmler for a half-hour over the decision, but to no avail.Himmler told Schellenberg that Erna had been under Gestapo observation and investigation and was now deemed \\"unreliable\\" because of the undesirable social circles with which she was associated.

Early years He was educated at St Benedict's School, in London, and after a short period as a private soldier in the Parachute Regiment attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst being commissioned into the 9th/12th Royal Lancers in 1976. He resigned his commission in 1980 when his newly posted commanding officer opposed his secondment to the Sultan of Oman's Armed Forces. Reverting to the rank of Trooper he undertook Selection for the Artists Rifles leaving as a Captain some ten years later. After a brief spell with the Anthony d'Offay gallery he joined his family paint business Papers and Paints. Having always had an interest in historic buildings he began a study of the methods and materials employed in their decoration. In 1993 he completed a part-time degree in the subject at the University of East London. Recent career Patrick Baty has acted as a consultant on many major restoration projects in the United Kingdom. He was a long-standing committee member of the Georgian Group and a Fellow of both the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland and the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures & Commerce. Baty is a founding member of both the Traditional Paint Forum and the Architectural Paint Group. Projects Projects have ranged from King Henry VIII‚Äôs heraldic Beasts; Baroque churches; country houses; wartime RAF stations and London housing estates to structures such as Tower Bridge and Holborn Viaduct. He also works in the USA. Work with colour In the 1980s Patrick Baty produced a range of paint colours based on those offered by a Scottish house-painter in 1807, this sparked off the present wave of historically-themed paint ranges which are still seen today. In April 2000, Homes & Gardens described him as being ‚ÄúUndoubtedly the most influential of our (paint) experts‚Ä¶whose breadth and depth of knowledge is unrivalled.‚Äù In recent years, on two separate occasions, he has been employed by ICI (Dulux) and The Little Greene to develop ranges of traditional paint colours for English Heritage. Colour ranges have also been produced for the French and German markets. The colours traditionally employed on the exteriors of buildings in Bath, Edinburgh, Penzance and in Gloucester have been investigated for the local planning authorities and guidelines produced for them. The colours used on the exteriors of Chelsea houses in the 19th century have also been identified and an article published for the Chelsea Society. He has recently finished work on a range of exterior colours based on regional use in France. A similar project looking at regional colour in the United Kingdom is in progress. In 2007 his company, Papers and Paints, was awarded a Royal Warrant for his work with colour. Personal life He is married with a daughter and two sons. Patrick Baty is the great grandson of the artists Robert Bevan and Stanis≈Çawa de Kar≈Çowska. Sir Philip Hendy, Director of the National Gallery (1946‚Äì1967), commented that Bevan was perhaps the first Englishman to use pure colour in the 20th Century.Preface to the 1961 Bevan retrospective exhibition at Colnaghi. Lecturing and writing Baty lectures often on the general subject of paint and colour of the 18th and 19th centuries. The audiences range widely from the staff of the national amenity organisations, to preservation enthusiasts. He has been a frequent lecturer on graduate and postgraduate courses at several universities, to architects on Continuing Professional Development courses, and to conservation officers. He has spoken at a number of international symposia in Europe, and lectured and run courses along the East coast of the United States. His published works are listed here and he has also contributed to and edited various other books on the subject of paint and colour; Robert Bevan and also on The Artists Rifles.

Only one was completed. Development The company designation, 2F.1, meant that the Nautilus was Blackburn's first two- seat fighter, though it was really intended as a carrier-based fleet spotter with interception capability. It was designed to Air Ministry Specification O.22/26. Though issued in June 1926, this specification did not reach a decision on the final engine to be used until October 1927; prototype contracts were only placed in January 1928, and the four chosen manufacturers did not produce prototypes for trial until 1929. These were the eventual winners, the navalised Hawker Hart first prototype later produced as the Hawker Osprey plus the Fairey Fleetwing, the Short Gurnard and the Blackburn Nautilus. All these were powered by the V-12 water-cooled Rolls-Royce F.XIIMS - later known as the Kestrel IIMS - which produced 525 hp (391 kW) and had a small cross-sectional area. The slim power unit encouraged the design of slender, well-streamlined fuselages, and the nose of the Nautilus was longer and more pointed than even that of the Ripon III, which used a larger area W-12 Napier Lion engine. The wooden propeller was two-bladed with a diameter of 11 ft (3.35 m). Like most of Blackburn's aircraft of the time, the fuselage was built up around four steel longerons; it was duralumin-covered from the nose to just aft of the rear observer/gunner's cockpit, the rest fabric- covered. The pilot's cockpit was immediately in front of the observer's, under an upper trailing edge cutout. A braced, rather rectangular tailplane was carried at the top of the fuselage. There was fixed fin surface both above and below the fuselage and the rudder with its horn balance had an upper fin and extended down to the lower part. Both the tailplane incidence and (more unusually) the alignment of the upper part of the fin could be adjusted in flight via trimming wheels. The robust undercarriage was a broad, split-axle type with mainwheels fitted with disc brakes. As a seaplane, it could be fitted either with a two-float arrangement or with a single central float, the latter intended to give a better field of view to the observer. The slim fuselage of the Nautilus did not have its keel aligned with the lower wing, as on most biplanes; rather, the centreline was at mid-gap. Blackburn used the gap between keel and wing to insert a faired radiator with a shutter- controlled front intake. This rather enhanced the Nautilus' pointed appearance. The wings were of two-bay construction with parallel struts, staggered and swept. Only the lower wing had dihedral. There were ailerons on both upper and lower wings. The wings were foldable for carrier storage. Operational history The Nautilus was first flown at Brough Aerodrome in May 1929, by T. Neville Stack and testing lead to some changes to the radiator and elevators. It went on to flight trials at RAF Martlesham Heath that August. With the Gurnard eliminated, the other competitors with the Nautilus went to sea on in January 1930. Unsuccessful in the trials, the Nautilus was remodelled as a ship-to-shore communicator after removal of the Scarff ring from the rear seat. In 1931, it went back to Martlesham and was used for a couple of years as a cross-country communications aircraft.

She was introduced in the show's fifth season as an attending surgeon and the new chief of pediatric surgery. Originally contracted to appear in three episodes, Capshaw's contract was extended to the remainder of the fifth season, with her becoming a series regular in the sixth season. Robbins has been characterized as \\"quirky\\", \\"perky\\" and is well known for wearing wheely sneakers and a Holly Hobbie pink scrub cap, intended to appeal to her young patients. She was established as a love-interest for orthopedic resident Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) after the Torres' storyline with Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith) was cut short due to what series creator Shonda Rhimes called \\"a lack of chemistry\\". Shonda Rhimes was in contrast pleased with the chemistry between Robbins and Torres, citing the addition of Capshaw to the cast as an element of the season of which she was most proud. Initial media reaction to the character was positive. Matt Mitovich of TV Guide described her as a \\"fan favorite\\", and Chris Monfette for IGN praised the addition of \\"fresh, new characters\\", such as Robbins over the course of the season. Along with Sarah Drew, Capshaw was fired in March 2018 for \\"creative\\" reasons regarding cast changes 10 seasons into playing the character. Shonda Rhimes alluded to the impact Capshaw's character had representing the LGBTQ community. She praised both actresses for \\"bringing these characters to life with such vibrant performance and for inspiring women around the globe\\". The decision was controversial, sparking backlash from fans and further speculation about the connection of their firing with Ellen Pompeo's new $20 million contract a year for the show. Showrunner Krista Vernoff stated, however, that the decision was purely creative, not budgetary. Capshaw made a statement, explaining the significance Robbins had on fans: \\"She was one of the first members of the LGBTQ community to be represented in a series regular role on network television. Her impact on the world is permanent and forever. Forever.\\" Storylines Following the death of Dr. Jordan Kenley (John Sloman), Chief Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) replaces his head of pediatric surgery with Dr. Arizona Robbins, a graduate of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Robbins has a romantic interest in orthopedic 5 year resident Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) and later goes on to kiss her. The two embark on a relationship, but when Torres' father, Carlos (H√©ctor Elizondo), learns of the relationship, he threatens to cut her off financially unless she returns home with him. When Torres' father returns to Seattle and continues to reject his daughter's sexuality, Robbins is able to convince him to reconsider. She tells Mr. Torres that her father was able to accept her own sexuality, as she promised him she was still the \\"good man in a storm\\" he raised her to be, and that Torres is still the same person he raised. Torres is dismayed to learn that Robbins doesn't want children, and the two come to a conclusion that they cannot continue their relationship, since they both want different things. However, after a shooter enters Seattle Grace with a vendetta for Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), and Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), they are in lockdown together, and the two reconcile. Robbins receives word that she has been given a grant to go to Malawi, and become a doctor there. In the end, Torres is shown to have accepted this as well and has decided to leave with Robbins. However, a fight at the airport results in Robbins leaving for Malawi without Torres, ending their relationship. She returns, hoping to rekindle her relationship with Torres, but is initially rejected. Eventually, Torres reveals that she is pregnant with Mark Sloan (Eric Dane)'s baby. Robbins accepts the situation, and she and Torres restart their relationship. Torres gifts Robbins with a weekend getaway, and Robbins proposes to Torres. After proposing, the two get in a car crash leaving Torres in critical condition. A series of surgeries follows, including the delivery of her premature baby, along with emotional breakdowns of both Sloan and Robbins. Upon the awakening of Torres, she accepts her marriage proposal, and the two are married by Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson). As the fifth year residents are coming close to the end of their residency, Robbins urges Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) to work under her. At the end of the Grey's Anatomy (season 8), Robbins is hurt badly in a plane crash, resulting in her left leg being amputated. In the aftermath of the plane accident, in which Sloan and Lexie Grey were killed, the hospital is sued and eventually found liable for negligence. Each victim including Shepherd, Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), and Robbins herself must receive $15 million of compensation, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurance companies refuse to pay. Those doctors and Callie buy the hospital with the help of the Harper-Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. Robbins is initially cold towards Callie because she was the one who decided for an amputation. She also struggles with body image issues, but they slowly reconcile as Robbins tries to adapt to her new life. When Dr. Lauren Boswell (Hilarie Burton) arrives at the hospital to reconstruct the face of a baby and flirts with Robbins, she is flattered that a stranger still finds her attractive despite knowing about her injury and the two have a one-night stand. After finding out that Arizona cheated on her with Lauren, Callie kicks Arizona out of their apartment. They also let out their true feelings about the accident and more is revealed about how they actually have felt. Callie initially agrees to couples therapy, but she shows up at the office only to tell Arizona that she isn't going in. Arizona gets drunk with April for a laugh while Callie attends a fundraiser. Arizona is led to believe that she and Leah slept together, however all they did was dance and make grilled cheese sandwiches after watching Derek perform surgery on film. Arizona pursues a sexual relationship with Leah but cuts ties with her when Callie asks her to come back home. It is revealed that Arizona became pregnant via a sperm donor prior to sleeping with Lauren, but later miscarried. They decided to try again for a second child, but after agreeing that Callie would carry it, Callie went to see an OB/GYN and discovered that she had developed adhesions in her uterus since Sofia's birth, meaning she can't carry any more children. When she told Arizona, Arizona offered to carry the baby, but Callie decided that since they're still on unsteady footing that if something goes wrong, they won't make it and she doesn't want to put them in that position. They agree to postpone their plans to have another baby. However, in the season finale of Season 10 it is implied that Callie and Arizona's dream of having another child may come by means of a surrogate. At the beginning of Season 11, Callie and Arizona decide to have a baby by surrogate and Arizona applies for a fetal surgery fellowship with Dr. Herman. Arizona, with a heavy workload because of the fellowship, and Callie have an argument in the waiting room, and they choose to go to therapy together, resulting in a 30-day break. Arizona believes that the break strengthened their relationship and made her realize that she needs Callie - Callie on the other hand declares that the break gave her a taste of the freedom that she has been missing. Callie walks away and the two get a divorce later. Callie wants to take Sofia and move to New York with Penny but Arizona does not want to be separated from her daughter so she hires a lawyer and they go to court for a custody battle. After a long case, Arizona wins sole custody of Sofia, but in the end she ends up sharing Sofia with Callie because she thinks that 'both of Sofia's moms deserve to be happy'. Callie is referenced occasionally by Arizona and Sofia after her departure from the show. In season 14 Sofia moves back with Arizona because she misses her but also frequently misses Callie. Arizona starts a research project to figure out why mother mortality rates are so high in the US versus other countries. At the conclusion of season 14, Arizona departs the show to move to New York to be with Sofia and Callie and the two reconcile. Development Casting and creation It was first reported in December 2008 that Capshaw would be joining the cast of Grey's Anatomy as pediatric surgeon Arizona Robbins, for a multi-episode arc. Capshaw was initially scheduled to appear in only three episodes of the show's fifth season, but series creator Shonda Rhimes later extended Capshaw's contract to appear in all of the season's remaining episodes, becoming a series regular in the sixth season. Speaking of the new addition, Rhimes said: This promotion saw Robbins become the only lesbian series regular on primetime TV. Robbins is described as \\"quirky [and] perky\\" by TV Guide Matt Mitovich, and \\"a clear and rational surgeon who is not ruled by her emotions\\" by Kris De Leon of BuddyTV. William Harper, writer of the episode \\"Beat Your Heart Out\\" in which Robbins and Torres kiss for the first time, has deemed Robbins: \\"genuinely, positively interested in people, in the most selfless way.\\" Commenting on Robbins' confidence, Capshaw commented: \\"she never thinks she's wrong and you don't hate her for it. There's no ego though, she just always thinks she's right and she is.\\" She is portrayed as having \\"wacky tendencies\\", including wearing roller shoes to work.  Characterization  The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) characterized Robbins as \\"confident\\", \\"ambitious\\", and \\"cheerful\\". Shortly after her arrival in the show, Robbins became a love- interest for Torres (Ramirez). The relationship between the two is referred to by fans by the portmanteau \\"Calzona\\". Torres' previous girlfriend Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith) was written out of Grey's Anatomy in 2008, due to a lack of chemistry between the characters. Rhimes praised the chemistry between Robbins and Torres in contrast, comparing it to that between the show's primary couple Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Shepherd (Dempsey), and stating: \\"They have that little thing that makes you want to watch them.\\" Rhimes named the addition of Capshaw to the cast as one of the elements of the season she was most proud of, commenting that she wished she could have found Callie a love interest that \\"sparkled\\" sooner, but was pleased with eventually having found one in Robbins. When Robbins turned Torres down in the episode \\"An Honest Mistake\\" due to her inexperience with women, series writer Peter Nowalk offered the insight: Although the characters go on to begin a relationship, the show's one-hundredth episode \\"What a Difference a Day Makes\\" sees them experience difficulties as a result of Torres' father rejecting her for her sexuality. Rhimes commented on their ultimate reconciliation: \\"I love [Callie] with Arizona. [...] I like that they make me feel hopeful about love.\\" Rhimes has said of their relationship in the sixth season: \\"I would like to see Callie happily in a long-term relationship. We have so much to explore with them, because we barely know anything about [Arizona].\\" Capshaw has characterized the relationship as \\"incredibly understanding and compassionate and sensitive\\". She described the sixth season as being about: \\"cementing a very mature and grounded relationship and taking it forward. This is a drama, of course; there will be conflict, but for the time being, they're enjoying being in a relationship that seems stable.\\" Asked whether Robbins and Torres might marry in the future, Capshaw replied: \\"There's probably a lot more stuff that has to happen before that happens. [...] I don't think they're going to get married just to get married. As Arizona goes, I think she has incredible discipline and she does, as you said, have a very strict moral compass and marriage would not be something she would jump into without giving it a great amount of thought.\\" Discussing Robbins' relationship with Torres' former lover Sloan, Capshaw divulged: \\"Whenever there's been a chance to play that I am intimidated by him or being standoffish, I've always chosen to make it very playful. It's much more Arizona's style to find it very amusing.\\" Reception Capshaw's connection with Sara Ramirez was praised among critics. Robbins ranked seventh in a top ten list of gay characters on TV compiled by Jane Boursaw of TV Squad: Commenting on Hahn's abrupt departure from the show, Dorothy Snarker, writing for LGBT website AfterEllen.com observed of Robbins and Torres' relationship: \\"I [...] can't help but be wary of how the Grey's writers will handle this relationship. Jessica has proven lovely and likable in her brief screen time so far. But it's not how the romance starts, but what happens next that really matters.\\" AfterEllen.com also included Robbins in their poll of the Top 50 Lesbian and Bisexual Characters, ranking her at No. 3 and in their Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters, placing her at No. 2. Matt Mitovich of TV Guide noted that Robbins \\"quickly established herself as a fan favorite\\", describing her as: \\"a breath of fresh air in the often angsty halls of Seattle Grace.\\" Chris Monfette for IGN has opinionated that the fifth season of Grey's Anatomy was an improvement on the previous two seasons, attributing this in part to the introduction of \\"fresh, new characters\\" Robbins and Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). Monfette wrote that Arizona's ultimate contribution to the season was \\"introducing the element of childcare to Seattle Grace\\", which in turn gave Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) \\"a great arc\\". Jennifer Godwin for E! Online approved of Arizona's season six promotion to a series regular, particularly as it meant the continuation of her relationship with Callie.

Lenders agree to lend borrowers funds only \\"overnight\\" i.e. the borrower must repay the borrowed funds plus interest at the start of business the next day. Given the short period of the loan, the interest rate charged in the overnight market, known as the overnight rate is, generally speaking, the lowest rate at which banks lend money. Most of the activity in the so-called overnight market in fact occurs in the morning immediately after the start of business for the day. The typical day at a cash management group for a deposit-taking financial institution begins with forecasting the institution's clients' liquidity needs over the course of that day. If this projection is that the institutions' clients will need more money over the course of the day than the institution has on hand, the institution will borrow money on the overnight market that day. On the other hand, if the analyst projects that the institution will have surplus money on hand beyond that needed by its clients that day, then it will lend money on the overnight market that day. The bulk of trading occurs in the morning and is based on these projections. If, however, over the course of the day, the actual amount of money required by the institution's clients departs from that projected in the morning, it may become necessary for the institution to borrow money on the overnight market to meet this unexpected demand from its clients; conversely, if the institution finds itself with more funds on hand than it anticipated late in the day, it will then lend those funds on the overnight market. The overnight rate fluctuates over the course of a business day, depending on the amount of money demanded from and supplied to the overnight market over the course of the day. The rate quoted as the \\"overnight rate\\" may be the rate at the end of the day, or an average of the rate over the course of the day. Banks are the largest participant in the overnight market, although some other large financial institutions, e.g. mutual funds, also buy and sell on the overnight market as a way to manage unanticipated cash needs or as a temporary haven for money until the institution can decide on where to invest that money.

It is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It can be found in a variety of habitats, including wet meadows and deciduous woodlands. Chamaelirium luteum has a basal rosette of around six 8‚Äì15 cm leaves, from which a single spike-like raceme inflorescence (1‚Äì1.5 cm diameter, 8‚Äì30 cm length) emerges. The plants are generally dioecious, with male-biased gender ratios in a given population. This is due to higher mortality of female plants, and the tendency of female plants to flower less frequently. Female stalks tend to be taller, giving a total maximum plant height of about 1.2 m, but also tend to have about ten times fewer flowers. Chamaelirium luteum is the only member of its monotypic genus, and is quite rare at the fringes of its range. Distribution Chamaelirium luteum can be found in temperate North America, United States and Canada. It occurs in the east of the Mississippi and it is historically known from southern Ontario. Etymology The etymology of Chamaelirium luteum comes from the Greek and means: Chamai = \\"on the ground\\", leirion = \\"lilly\\", lutes = \\"yellow\\". Illustration of Chamaelirium luteum Cultivation Because Chamaelirium luteum is normally collected wild, it is at risk of extinction. Cultivation techniques are still under development to satisfy the demand from the market. Site selection Chamaelirium luteum prefers moist, well drained and acidic soil (pH: 4.5 ‚Äì 6) with a high humus content. In open fields it should be shaded by a shading structure, to protect it from the direct radiation of the sun. For forest cultivation it should be preferably planted in an area with tall hardwood trees. Planting Chamaelirium luteum can be propagated through seeds or root division. For propagation through root division the rhizomes can be divided by cutting them into pieces of 1/4 inch (6mm). This disc-shaped pieces should be left to callus over night and can be planted in pots on the next day. The soil should be kept moist and shaded until the plants emerge. Young plants can be transplanted in a well prepared growing bed with a high organic matter in a planting distance of 6‚Äì10 inch (15‚Äì25 cm). To support the plants with nutrients, pine needles, rotted conifer-derived sawdust or bark mulch should be added to the top soil. For propagation through seeds, the seeds should be sown in late Fall or early Winter to a depth of 1/8 inch (3 mm) in breeding beds with high humus content. For a good germination the seed should go through stratification. The plants grow best in soil mixture of peat moss and decomposed pine needles. When the young plants emerge they should be left in undisturbed at least for one growing season. Then they can be transplanted as for the propagation method through root division. Maintenance The plant should be moist and shaded and protected from herbivory by snails and slugs or deer in woods. Weeds should always be removed. Uses Chamaelirium luteum is used as ornamental or medical herb. Historically it has been used by the Natives of America. It has the reputation, to have been one of the most widely used in North America. It was traditionally used to prevent miscarriages and it has the reputation of improving fertility. Nowadays it is used to treat different problems as menstrual problems, pregnancy complaints, fertility issues, ovarian cysts and diuretic The rhizomes can be harvested after six years and is done in Fall after collecting the mature seeds. After removing the soil and the roots from other plants, the rhizome should be stored unwashed until further processing. It should be prevented from drying out and also from too high moisture, which could lead to mold infestation. Before processing, the rhizome should be washed carefully. Bioactive components The bioactive components are a mixture of steroidal saponins, including chamaelirin and aglycone diosgenin. These bioactive substances act as an emmenagogue, diuretic and emetic.

Biography Jensen was born in 1837 in K√∂nigsberg to a family of musicians. Although largely self-taught, he also had instruction from Louis Ehlert, Louis K√∂hler and Friedrich Marpurg (1825‚Äì1884). Marpurg was the director of the K√∂nigsberg Theater and the great- grandson of the music theorist Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg. In 1856 Jensen went to Russia to teach in the hope of earning enough money to take lessons with Robert Schumann with whom he had been in correspondence. However, Schumann had died in the interim. In 1857 he became was the music director of the Posen City Theater. From 1858 until 1860 he lived in Copenhagen and befriended Niels Gade. He returned K√∂nigsberg and composed much of his music during that time. He taught advanced piano at Carl Tausig's \\"Schule des h√∂heren Clavierspiels\\" in Berlin from 1866 until 1868 when serious illness forced him to retire. He went to Dresden, and then to Graz in 1870 and finally to Baden-Baden where he died of tuberculosis at the age of 42. Works Jensen wrote about 160 art songs as well as choral pieces. His music for piano includes a Sonata in F-sharp minor (Op. 25), a set of 25 √âtudes (Op. 32), and Erotikon, Op. 44, seven pieces depicting scenes from Greek legends. He also wrote music for piano four hands. His orchestral music consisted of a Concert Overture in E minor and a Geistliches Tonst√ºck. He started work on opera Die Erbin von Montfort in 1864-65, but did not finish it. After his death, Wilhelm Kienzl adapted the music to a new libretto, Turandot, written by Jensen's daughter Elsbeth, who wrote under the pseudonym \\"Egbert Jensen\\".

In 2004, the population of Rhina consisted of 509 residents. History The village was first mentioned in documents in 1003. However, the first traces of humans in the area are from the early Paleolithic Era and Middle Stone Age from the years 10000 to 6000BC. Settlement during the Middle Ages occurred mainly in the area around the German abbey at Fulda, although sovereignty over the area would be widely established by German knights. From the late Middle Ages on, the families from Trubenbach (today Truembach), Bimbach, Buchenau, and Haune in Rhina were considerably wealthy. In the 15th century, the Landgraviate of Hesse succeeded in acquiring rights to the estate of Rhina. During the time of the Reformation, this led to violent conflicts between Hesse and the noble families over rights to the village. The church of Rhina was originally consecrated in the name of St. Nicholas. In 1529 and 1530, it was reformed. During the Reformation, the local production of pottery developed in the village. The first evidence of the presence of Jews in the village is documented from 1631 during the Thirty Years War. From the 18th century especially, the Jewish community grew at a regular rate, the first synagogue being erected in 1782. In 1806, Rhina came under the rule of the Kingdom of Westphalia. The neighboring village of was the seat of the nobility and Rhina belonged to the canton of . The church of Rhina was re-built in 1814. In 1821, Rhina was incorporated into the H√ºnfeld district of the Hessian province of Fulda. Rhina's synagogue was rebuilt from 1831 to 1832. In 1835, the first village-wide local elections were held. A Jewish cemetery was created in 1837. The residents of the villages of Wehrda, Rhina, Schletzenrod, and Wetzlos rebelled against the noble lordship of the region in the Revolution of 1848. In the course of the conflict, attacks were also carried out against Rhina's Jews. In 1862, following a great increase in the Jewish population of Rhinda, a Jewish grade school was opened. Rhina received its first telephone in 1902, and in 1912 developed water and plumbing infrastructure. In 1933, following an order by the NSDAP district leadership as well as the office of the regional administration, the Jewish members of the municipal council were forced to resign from their posts. From 1934, assaults on Jewish property and against those of Jewish faith began to occur. In 1935, those attending the synagogue were beaten up. In 1937, a catastrophic storm befell the village. On 10 November 1938, Rhina's large, integrated Jewish school was burnt to the ground. Rhina's mayor declared the village \\"judenfrei\\" (free of Jews) on 1 March 1939. 49 people were deported by train to ghettos and murdered in death camps. Beginning in 1949, reparations were made to surviving Jews and to the JRSO (Jewish Restitution Successor Organization) within the American occupation zone. In 1965, a village community center was dedicated on the former site of Rhina's synagogue. Rhina was greatly affected by floods after an overflowing of the Haune River in 1966. In 1971, within the framework of a redistricting act in Hesse, Rhina was incorporated into the community of Haunetal.

The 0.93 mile long, 6 metre wide circuit is used for year-round racing, training and leisure riding. History Chas Messenger, the local British Cycling Facilities Officer, organised cycle racing on the unopened Hayes Bypass for several years in the 1990s. Triple Olympic champion and Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins started his racing career on this prototype circuit as a schoolboy. Once the bypass opened to traffic, Messenger and Bill Bannister began searching for another closed road circuit in the area. After some abortive suggestions had been investigated, Minet Park emerged as a possible solution. What is now the park had been used to dump waste earth from the construction of the bypass. The area was, however, zoned for sports activities and community use. Paul Barker, a member of the Westerley Cycling Club and a London Borough of Hillingdon councillor was a key figure in steering plans for the circuit to a successful completion. The circuit was designed by Don Wiseman as a fast, easy to ride course: it is possible to pedal all the way round the circuit's corners. The circuit opened to riders in 1997. The early circuit headquarters were temporary huts. There are now permanent storage facilities (part funded by the Kenton Road Club) and in 2010 a clubhouse was opened beside the track with meeting and catering facilities and a classroom. Barker suggested to local cycling coaches Brian Wright and Ray Kelly that a children's club be started. The Prime Coaching organisation, together with others and the parents of the children created and developed the Hillingdon Slipstreamers. The group still meet at the circuit every Saturday morning. Bradley Wiggins is now the Slipstreamers' president. Usage The circuit is used regularly for racing and hosts an annual round of the national circuit race championship. There is a regular Winter series running from December to February. During the season there are races on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings and most weekends. There are formal and informal training sessions three or four days per week. A women- only leisure cycling group meet at the circuit on Friday afternoons. Youth only cycling club, Hillingdon Slipstreamers use the circuit every Saturday morning until midday, throughout the year. Duathlon events are run on the circuit on selected Mondays from April to August. The circuit is also used by the London Region Nordic Ski Club, for roller skiing events, for Human Powered Vehicle races, and for charity fun rides.

Its name was derived from a people called the Chaldoi (or Chalybes) that inhabited the region in antiquity. Chaldia was used throughout the Byzantine period and was established as a formal theme, known as the Theme of Chaldia (Greek: Œ∏Œ≠ŒºŒ± ŒßŒ±ŒªŒ¥ŒØŒ±œÇ), by 840. During the Late Middle Ages, it formed the core of the Empire of Trebizond until its fall to the Ottoman Empire in 1461. Anthony Bryer traces the origin of its name not to Chaldea, as Constantine VII had done, but to the Urartian language, for whose speakers ·∏™aldi was the Sun God. Bryer notes at the time of his writing that a number of villages in the Of district were still known as \\"Halt\\".Anthony Bryer, \\"Greeks and T√ºrkmens: The Pontic Exception\\", Dumbarton Oaks Papers, 29 (1975), p. 116f Other scholars, however, reject the Urartian connection. ŒßŒ¨ŒªœÖœà, the tribe's name in Greek, means \\"tempered iron, steel\\", a term that passed into Latin as chalybs, \\"steel\\". Sayce derived the Greek name Chalybe from Hittite Khaly-wa, \\"land of Halys\\".The Greek Colonisation of the Black Sea Area p. 74 More than an identifiable people or tribe, \\"Chalybes\\" was a generic Greek term for \\"peoples of the Black Sea coast who trade in iron\\".I. M. Diakonoff The Pre-history of the Armenian People, Yerevan, 1968 (Delmar, New York, 1984) . \\"The Greeks evidently used the name Chalybes for all of the inhabitants of the Pontus who traded in iron ore (see Pauly, s.v. Chalybes); in some cases we might suspect that the Moschi (in Pontus) and/or the Chalybes were foreign designations for the Chaldians (Halitu, Xaghtik') who actually did live between the Tibareni in the west, the Mosynoeci in the north, and the Matieni in the southeast.\\" Geography Initially, the name Chaldia was consigned to the highland region around G√ºm√º≈ühane, in northeast Anatolia, but in the middle Byzantine period, the name was extended to include the coastal areas, and thus the entire province around Trapezus (Trebizond, modern Trabzon). Forming the easternmost area of the Pontic Alps, Chaldia was bounded to the north by the Black Sea, to the east by Lazica, the westernmost part of Caucasian Iberia, to the south by Erzincan, Erzurum and what the Romans and Byzantines called Armenia Minor, and to the west by the western half of Pontus. Its main cities were the two ancient Greek colonies, Kerasus (modern Giresun) and Trapezus, situated in the coastal lowlands. The mountainous interior to the south, known as Mesochaldia (\\"Middle Chaldia\\"), was more sparsely inhabited and described by the 6th- century historian Procopius as \\"inaccessible\\", but rich in mineral deposits, especially lead, but also silver and gold. The mines of the region gave the name Argyropolis (\\"silver town\\", modern G√ºm√º≈ühane) to the principal settlement . History Byzantine sources provide evidence that the people of Chaldia and Tzanicha were descended from the indigenous inhabitants of the historical area of Chaldia. Strabo identifies them with the ancient people of Chalybia and describes them as rough and warlike.Jones, H.L. (ed.), Strabo, Geography (Loeb, New York 1917-1932), 548.18, 549.19. The first local inhabitants, the Chalybes, were counted among the earliest ironsmith nations by Classical writers.http://mgu.bg/geoarchmin/naterials/49Kuparadze-et-al.pdf Indeed, the Greek name for steel is chalybas (Greek: œáŒ¨ŒªœÖŒ≤Œ±œÇ), possibly deriving from them.. The first Greek colony was that of Trapezus, founded by Greek traders from Miletus, traditionally dated to 756 BC. Greek colonization was restricted to the coast, and in later ages Roman control remained likewise only nominal over the tribes of the interior.. The coastal regions, however, belonged to the Roman province of Pontus Polemoniacus. Only during the reign of the Byzantine emperor Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565) were the warlike tribes, the Sannoi or Tzannoi, subdued, Christianized, and brought under central rule.. Justinian included the entire region in the newly constituted province of Armenia I Magna with Trapezus as its capital (under Emperor Maurice, it was renamed Armenia III). In the second half of the 7th century, with the establishment of the theme system, the region (Pontus Polemoniacus with the portion of Armenia I known as Keltzene) became part of the Armeniac Theme, initially as the tourma (division) of Chaldia, and later as a semi-distinct duchy (doukaton) or archontate. By 840, and perhaps as early as 824, it was constituted as a theme in its own right.. Arab geographers of the 9th and 10th centuries report differently on the theme: Ibn Khordadbeh reports that it counted six fortified places, Qudama ibn Ja'far that its troops numbered 4,000, while Ibn al-Faqih writes that its governing strategos commanded 10,000 men (certainly exaggerated) and had two subordinate tourmarchai. According to 10th-century documents, the strategos of Chaldia received twenty pounds of gold as an annual salary, of which half was paid by the state treasury and the rest came from the tax proceeds of his province, including the kommerkion tax on the important trade routes from the East that converged on Trapezus. In the early 10th century, the theme's southern portion, the district of Keltzene, was detached and added to the newly established theme of Mesopotamia. Until the eastern gains in the latter 10th century, Chaldia remained the northeastern frontier of the Byzantine Empire. During the periods 1091/1095‚Äì1098 and 1126‚Äì1140, the theme was practically autonomous from the Byzantine government. During the first period, under its doux, Theodore Gabras, the region had been cut off from the remaining Byzantine territories by the Seljuk Turks, while during the second period, doux Constantine Gabras had rebelled against Emperor John II Komnenos. After the sack of Constantinople in 1204 by Latin crusaders, two Byzantine successor states were established: the Empire of Nicaea, and the Despotate of Epirus. A third, the Empire of Trebizond, was created after Alexios Komnenos, commanding the Georgian expedition in Chaldia a few weeks before the sack of Constantinople, found himself de facto emperor, and established himself in Trebizond.A. A. Vasiliev, \\"The Foundation of the Empire of Trebizond (1204‚Äì1222)\\", Speculum, 11 (1936), pp. 18f Indeed, by the 14th century, the Empire was reduced practically to the territory of the old theme.. The Empire of Trebizond managed to survive through successive upheavals by a combination of its inaccessible location, a small but capable army, and a sound diplomacy based on marriage alliances, before finally falling to the Ottomans in 1461. Even thereafter, isolated fortresses in the interior continued to resist. Only in 1479 was the region subdued, when the castle of Golacha, the last remaining Christian stronghold in Asia Minor, fell. Significant numbers of Pontic Greeks remained in the region throughout the Ottoman period, until the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey.

It is a tributary of the Nisqually River, joining the river just above the mouth of the Paradise River. The creek is known for having several well known waterfalls along its course.  Course  The creek originates at the toe of the Van Trump Glacier and flows south. Just west of Mildred Point, the creek drops over small Upper Comet Falls. Shortly below that, the creek drops over the largest and best known of the falls on the creek, Comet Falls. Shortly below Comet Falls, Falls Creek joins Van Trump Creek. The creek drops over another major waterfall just below the mouth of Falls Creek, Van Trump Falls. After dropping over the falls, the creek enters a deep canyon, which extends almost all the way to its mouth. About halfway through the gorge, the creek drops over dangerous-to-access Lower Van Trump Falls before exiting the canyon by dropping over majorly altered Christine Falls. The creek then continues south to where it meets the Nisqually.  Debris Flows of 2001  On August 14, 2001, a ton of debris washed down from the Kautz Glacier and flowed down the creek, turning the creek into a raging torrent of mud and other debris. Amazingly, most of the waterfalls on the creek were not majorly harmed. The mudflows took out the bridge above Comet Falls and even today the bridge is still out. The mudflows scoured the creeks banks clean of any plant life and replaced it with dead vegetation.  Floods of 2003 and 2006  In 2003 and 2006, Van Trump Creek and Falls Creek experienced major floods. The floods brought huge amounts of water down, large enough to take out all the dead vegetation, left by the 2001 mudflows, lining the creek in many places and replace them with gigantic boulders in some areas, especially below Upper Comet Falls.

After a thorough although conservative art education at the Technical School in Wanganui, Edith Collier left New Zealand in 1913 for St John's Wood School of Art in London. She was then aged 27. Rapidly disillusioned, and feeling marginalised as an expatriate woman painter, she became more influenced by other expatriates in London, and was to enjoy greater success through exhibiting with the Society of Women Artists and Women's International Art Club - venues outside the art establishment - and became a significant Modernist painter. Te Papa Collier returned to New Zealand in 1922 as an experienced artist with innovative ideas, but as a spinster in provincial Wanganui received harsh treatment, including what Drayton describes as savage, critical assessment and negative response from her own community.

The Citizen's Alliances were closely related to employers' associations but allowed participation of a broad range of sympathetic citizens in addition to those employers apt to be affected by strikes. Originating in the American state of Ohio as the \\"Modern Order of Bees,\\" the Citizens' Alliance movement spread westwards, playing a particularly important role in labor relations in the states of Colorado and California. Citizens' Alliance groups often worked in tandem with smaller but better financed employers' organizations interested in establishing or maintaining open shop labor conditions, including the Mine Owners' Associations (MOA) or the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). Organizational history General outline The Citizens' Alliance movement originated in Dayton, Ohio circa 1900 as a secret society called the \\"Modern Order of Bees,\\" also known colloquially as the \\"Hooly-Goolies.\\"Philip S. Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Volume 3: The Policies and Practices of the American Federation of Labor, 1900-1909. New York: International Publishers, 1964; pg. 26. The group was viewed as an adjunct of a local employers' association, with membership open not only to the narrow circle of employers, but also to any citizen who was not a member of a trade union.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Volume 3, pp. 35-36. The term \\"Citizens' Alliance\\" was adopted from the name of a political organization established more than a decade earlier. The populist National Citizens' Industrial Alliance of 1891 sought to bolster the rights of working people; the employers' Citizens' Alliance of 1903 sought to curtail union power.Rosemary Feurer, Radical Unionism in the Midwest, 1900-1950. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2006; pg. 8. If the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) represented the large industrialists, the Citizens' Alliance groups were composed of smaller local associations. These entities were united in the belief that organized labor was \\"evil and un- American.\\"William Millikan, A Union Against Unions: The Minneapolis Citizens Alliance and Its Fight Against Organized Labor. St. Paul, MN: Minnesota Historical Society Press, 2001; pg. 31. Within three years it was perceived that the \\"educational campaigns\\" of the NAM and the CIA had reversed public opinion and ended the growth of unionism. At the 1906 CIA convention Charles W. Post, the breakfast cereal manufacturer, declared that, Methods Citizens' Alliance groups also sometimes conducted boycotts in an attempt to isolate and influence employers who sought labor peace through the recognition of unions and collective bargaining. By way of example, in May 1903 representatives of the Denver Citizens' Alliance and the local manufacturer's association conducted an organized campaign to visit local employers with unionized work-forces in order to force them to abrogate their labor contracts.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Volume 3, pg. 47. Deadlines were issued and boycotts threatened to be visited upon those firms failing to heed to Citizens' Alliance's warnings. Such hardball tactics drew condemnation in the local press, with the Denver Post opining: Boycotts imposed by local Citizens' Alliance groups hit both sides of the production chain, including both organized refusals to sell components to and organized refusals to buy finished products from subject firms.Foner, History of the Labor Movement in the United States: Volume 3, pg. 48. National organization The various locally organized Citizens' Alliances and employers' associations were joined into a unified national organization by a convention held in October 1903 in Chicago, which launched the Citizens' Industrial Association of America.Stuart B. Kaufman, Peter J. Albert, and Grace Palladino (eds.), The Samuel Gompers Papers: Volume 6: The American Federation of Labor and the Rise of Progressivism, 1902-6. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1997; pg. 193, fn. 1. State-level activities Alabama =Birmingham= A Citizens' Alliance group was formed in Birmingham, Alabama in August 1903. California =San Francisco= The year 1900 saw dramatic growth of trade unionism in San Francisco, then the largest city on the Pacific Coast.Robert Knight, Industrial Relations in the San Francisco Bay Area, 1900-1918. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1960; pg. 44. By the middle of that year the California Bureau of Labor Statistics counted no fewer than 90 trade unions in the city of San Francisco and an additional 24 in neighboring Alameda County on the East side of San Francisco Bay. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated a total union membership of 20,000 for San Francisco ‚Äî a significant percentage of the city's approximately 340,000 residents ‚Äî as well as 3,000 more in Oakland and Berkeley of the East Bay.Knight, Industrial Relations in the San Francisco Bay Area, 1900-1918, pg. 45. Moreover, while these mid-year figures may have represented something of an overcount due to methodological errors by the BLS, the trade union movement was unquestionably experiencing rapid growth and may well have exceeded these estimates by the end of the year. The demands of these growing unions for a shorter working day and higher wages put pressure upon local employers. A series of strikes swept the city, the most bitter of which being a battle between the San Francisco Building Trades Council and Bay Area planing-mill employers attempting to establish the 8-hour day. A newly unified Bakers' Union won a six-day work week, retail clerks unionized and campaigned for 6 pm closings, and unionized electrical workers and longshoremen won wage gains as the result of strike actions.Knight, Industrial Relations in the San Francisco Bay Area, 1900-1918, pp. 46-48. Local garment workers of the Cloakmakers' Union conducted an effective boycott against three local manufacturers, gaining the cooperation of retail stores and maintaining pickets against the involved companies.Knight, Industrial Relations in the San Francisco Bay Area, 1900-1918, pp. 49-50. Many employers, interested in maintaining the status quo in terms of hours and wages, sought to organize themselves against their increasingly organized workers. This took concrete form in April 1901 when there was established the Employers' Association of San Francisco.Knight, Industrial Relations in the San Francisco Bay Area, 1900-1918, pg. 66. This organization maintained strict secrecy as to its size, membership composition, financing, and goals, but it emerged before the public eye in May, when it first attempted to exert organized opposition in San Francisco labor disputes. The secrecy employed by the Employers' Association created public image of a mysterious and omnipotent force; in reality the group included only a small minority of San Francisco's employers.Knight, Industrial Relations in the San Francisco Bay Area, 1900-1918, pg. 67. Those which did participate, however, were among the city's largest and best- financed, and new members were required to post financial guarantees of their observance of the policies advanced by the organization. It was estimated that even by May 1901 a war chest of $150,000 had been amassed for the organized fight against trade unionism ‚Äî a total which union leaders believed to have doubled or tripled by the end of that first summer. A series of increasingly bitter strikes followed, with labor further pushing the envelope with the establishment of the Union Labor Party that same year, followed by the electoral capture of City Hall. It was in this context that the Citizens' Alliance movement emerged in California, as a component of the anti-union reaction to growth of organized labor in the state's urban center of San Francisco. The first branch of the Citizens' Alliance was established in the city sometime in the winter of 1903-04.Knight, Industrial Relations in the San Francisco Bay Area, 1900-1918, pg. 131. The organization, which worked hand- in-glove with the Employers' Association of San Francisco, was the local reflection of a national campaign on behalf of the open shop and drew active interest and support from the National Association of Manufacturers and other industrial leaders eager to see organized labor's West coast stronghold deconstructed.Knight, Industrial Relations in the San Francisco Bay Area, 1900-1918, pp. 139-140. At the time of the establishment of San Francisco Citizens' Alliance a critical strategic decision was made: rather than making use of well-connected local employers to staff the organization, professional anti-union functionaries were imported.Knight, Industrial Relations in the San Francisco Bay Area, 1900-1918, pg. 140. The organization also made the determination to engage in political action in an attempt to wrench the city administration of San Francisco from the hands of the Union Labor Party. Although not initially clear at the time, these two decisions had the unanticipated effect of increasing the unity of the labor movement and thereby helping to assure a third term of ULP control in the election of 1905. The San Francisco Citizens' Alliance branch claimed to have a membership of 16,000 in the fall of 1904.Knight, Industrial Relations in the San Francisco Bay Area, 1900-1918, pg. 141. As such, it was the largest branch of the organization in the state. Membership in the organization was bolstered by pressure said to have been exerted by employers on their managerial staff to join the group. Additionally, local offices of the Chamber of Commerce made efforts to drum up support for the group among their membership. =Other cities= In addition to its San Francisco branch, the Citizens' Alliance also maintained local organizations in Los Angeles (purportedly the largest group in the nation relative to size of the city); Stockton and Bakersfield in the Central Valley; Oakland, San Jose, and Palo Alto in the Bay Area; and Fort Bragg on the North Coast. The Los Angeles Citizens' Alliance branch was notably headed by Harrison Gray Otis, publisher of the Los Angeles Times and well known as one of the most bitter opponents of organized labor in the state. Colorado =Denver= James C. Craig became president of the Citizens' Alliance of Denver, which enrolled nearly 3,000 individual and corporate members within three weeks after its creation.George G. Suggs, Jr., Colorado's War on Militant Unionism: James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners. Detroit, MI: Wayne State University Press, 1972; pg. 67. It had a war chest of nearly $20,000.Suggs, Colorado's War on Militant Unionism, pg. 68. The organization had a \\"clandestine character\\", and all the inner workings of the organization were enshrouded \\"in deep secrecy\\", raising the possibility that \\"the group might take extralegal action against all organized labor.\\"Suggs, Colorado's War on Militant Unionism, pg. 69.\\"Article I, Citizens' Alliance Constitution,\\" in Carroll D. Wright (ed.), A Report on Labor Disturbances in the State of Colorado: From 1880 to 1904, Inclusive, With Correspondence Relating Thereto. Washington, DC: U.S. Bureau of Labor, 1905; pg. 46. Membership was restricted to persons, firms, associations, or corporations owning property, or engaged in business in Colorado, with members of labor organizations specifically excluded.\\"Article III, Citizens' Alliance Constitution,\\" in Wright (ed.), A Report on Labor Disturbances in the State of Colorado, pg. 46. Local Citizens' Alliance organizations throughout Colorado made up the Colorado Citizens' Alliance, which formed a close partnership with the Mine Owners' Association and with the Colorado National Guard. Together, these groups engaged in widespread extra-legal activities in the Cripple Creek gold mining district, where the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) had declared a strike. The Colorado Citizens' Alliance: =Telluride= During the 1903 strike in Telluride, the San Miguel County Citizens' Alliance circulated a petition accusing union leaders of the murder of William J. Barney, an out-of-town worker who had walked away from his job as a mine guard after only a week. A grand jury had concluded there was no evidence a crime had been committed, but members of the Alliance ignored that conclusion. When the alleged victim appeared in court seeking a divorce one year after he'd disappeared, at least two Alliance members discovered he was still alive. That knowledge didn't serve their purpose so they ignored it.Martin, The Corpse On Boomerang Road, pp. 142-147. Accusations that the strikers were a threat to mines, mills, power stations, reservoirs, train trestles, power lines, and trams were used to justify occupation by the national guard. The real purpose was protection of strikebreakers.Martin, The Corpse On Boomerang Road, pp. 208, 210. The Citizens' Alliance helped to decide who was arrested and who walked free, and union sympathies were the determining factor. Some union arrestees were brutally treated, with pistol blows to the head and rifle blows to the body. But generally, union men in Telluride were too well-behaved, and new criminal offenses had to be invented. For example, men simply standing together were guilty of conspiracy. \\"Offensive carriage\\" became a crime when union men \\"disturbed the peace and quiet\\" by the way they stood and walked. Undercover Pinkerton spy George W. Riddell was arrested on such a charge with a group of strikers and determined during incarceration, perhaps to no one's real surprise, that the miners had no plans of the sort with which they'd been accused.Martin, The Corpse On Boomerang Road, pp. 210, 212. The Alliance in Telluride advertised that there was no strike, and, with the militia, they \\"acted as a fortified employment agency for the mines.\\" Meanwhile, union miners could have pockets stuffed with money, but were still found guilty of vagrancy and expelled.Martin, The Corpse On Boomerang Road, pp. 206, 216, 238. Finally, the Citizens' Alliance in Telluride acted as a vigilante mob, issuing itself national guard rifles and rounding up the remaining sixty-five union men and supporters late on an icy night. Some of the detainees were without shoes and shirt, most without coats or hats. About fourteen of them were injured, at least one was robbed, and all were forced out of town.Martin, The Corpse On Boomerang Road, pp. 241-243. =Cripple Creek= In Cripple Creek the Citizens' Alliance organizations of Colorado willingly participated in the suspension of the Bill of Rights by the National Guard. To crush the union, its leaders were arrested without cause and either thrown in bullpens, or banished.Suggs, Colorado's War on Militant Unionism, pp. 105-106. Prisoners who won habeas corpus cases were released in court and then immediately re- arrested. A local newspaper was placed under military censorship, with all union-friendly information prohibited. Freedom of assembly was not allowed. The right to bear arms was suspended--citizens were required to give up their firearms and their ammunition.Elizabeth Jameson, All That Glitters: Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1998; pg. 213. Even \\"loitering or strolling about\\" was criminalized in an effort to crush the union.Jameson, All That Glitters, pg. 214. After spasms of violence -- some of them brutal crimes that were never properly investigated -- the Citizens' Alliance and their allies wrecked union halls throughout the district, and looted four union cooperative stores.Company L was also referred to as the Victor militia. See: Jameson, All That Glitters, pp. 218-219. Ultimately, many died and many families were torn apart in the successful effort to expel the union by force of arms. The struggle between employers and employees was viewed as a relationship imbued with class interests. Craig declared that one purpose of the Denver Citizens' Alliance was \\"correcting and preventing pernicious class legislation.\\"\\"Statement published in American Industries,\\" May 16, 1904, reprinted in Wright (ed.), A Report on Labor Disturbances in the State of Colorado, pp. 48-50. And the Cripple Creek District Citizens' Alliance delivered resolutions to the Colorado Governor which starkly expressed their goal of \\"controlling the lawless classes.\\"Suggs, Colorado's War on Militant Unionism, pg. 147. Craig wrote that the Citizens' Alliance movement \\"has completely counteracted the terror and influence of the boycott, the unlawful and un-American weapon of the unions.\\" In order to accomplish the goal of counteracting union boycotts, the Citizens' Alliance in Colorado used boycotts of its own. In hiring, they arranged for employers to boycott union members. They arranged for the Denver Advertisers' Association to boycott newspapers that expressed disapproval of the Citizens' Alliance and the Mine Owners' Association. They arranged for Cripple Creek newspapers to refuse to advertise the store of the Interstate Mercantile Company, which had bought out the stock of goods in a Western Federation of Miners store that had been ransacked by a mob. Minnesota =Minneapolis= In his book A Union Against Unions: The Minneapolis Citizens Alliance and Its Fight Against Organized Labor, William Millikan writes that David M. Parry stated \\"the true nature of the United States business community's drive against union labor\\" when he addressed the Minneapolis Commercial Club in 1903: Parry later became the first president of the Citizens' Industrial Alliance. Members of the Commercial Club, Minneapolis business leaders and their supporters who would sponsor the local Citizens' Alliance, responded favorably to the demand, declaring \\"Law and order must be enforced and...class domination over industry is not going to be tolerated.\\" In Minnesota, Citizens' Alliance leaders focused on defeating organized labor by establishing anti-union policies and legislation at the city, state, and federal levels. They sought to accomplish this, in part, by helping to incorporate the Minnesota Employers' Association (MEA).Millikan, A Union Against Unions, pp. 42-43. Millikan observes that Parry let slip in a moment of candor what the Minneapolis Citizens' Alliance would seek to keep secret for three decades: this was \\"a war between the owners of American industry and the working class.\\" Ohio =Dayton= In an effort to curb the local union movement in Dayton, Ohio, a Dayton Employers' Association was established in 1900. Washington =Seattle= Formation of the Citizens' Alliance of Seattle was announced in the Seattle Star late in September 1904. Annual dues were set at $31 per year, with a $1 initiation fee and headquarters opened in the city's Lumber Exchange Building.\\"Citizens' Alliance Begins Campaign Among Employers,\\" Seattle Star, vol. 6, no. 192, night edition (Oct. 3, 1904), pg. 1. Jacob Furth of the Seattle Electric Company was selected as the local organization's first president, with other officers coming from the managements of other local commercial concerns. The Citizens' Alliance of Seattle was launched behind a five point program that promised support of the open shop, opposition to sympathetic strikes and boycotts as well as picketing and other forms of \\"unlawful coercion and persecution,\\" the enforcement of existing laws, and the unfettered use of apprentices. The anti-union employers' organization claimed to be organizing in self-defense amidst an ongoing effort to expand the organized labor movement, with five organizers of the American Federation of Labor said to be already present in the city of Seattle with three more said to be en route. Wisconsin =Beloit= A Citizens' Alliance was organized in Beloit, Wisconsin in June 1903. The group claimed success in breaking one of the most influential trade unions in that city, with the Beloit Teamsters' Union surrendering its charter in February 1904.

It was the site of two battles in Hawaiian history. Location of Molokai within the Hawaiian Islands Early history Ka Wela means \\"the heat\\" in the Hawaiian language. It was the name of a traditional land division (ahupuaa) of ancient Hawaii, but the name is also used on several other islands. It is located about east of the town of Kaunakakai. A heiau is visible at on a ridge between the forks of Kawela Gulch. This is generally thought to be the place of refuge (Puuhonua) where the soldiers of Kapiioho o kalani fled during a great battle of about 1737. pp 136‚Äì138, 284, 288-289 In about February 1795, women and children escaped to Molokai when Kamehameha I had just conquered Maui. In pursuit, the vast fleet of war canoes stretched all along the coast from Kawela past Kaunakakai to the area known as Kalamaula. The army met little resistance this time. Queen Kalola was asked if the two kingdoms could be united by marrying off her daughter Ke≈çp≈´olani, who was considered to have the best royal family background, and thus would be suitable as a mother of future rulers. Her sons and grandsons would rule the Kingdom of Hawaii as the House of Kamehameha. In the late 19th century it was part of the vast Molokai Ranch owned by King Kamehameha V and managed by the family of Rudolph Wilhelm Meyer. Recent history LƒÅnai island The area now has a few vacation homes along the shore, and one subdivision of 120 lots that are zoned for agriculture on the hills. Wadsworth Y. H.

Walnut Park The park was deeded to the city in 1870 by prominent citizen George F. Comstock. Walnut Park is itself a three-block long park. The long sides of the park are bordered on the west by Walnut Place, on the east by Walnut Avenue. Cross streets are Harrison Street, Adams Street, Marshall Street, and Waverly Avenue from north to south. The park was originally landscaped with shade trees, but the Dutch Elm disease wiped out that overall effect in the 1950s. In 1972, new trees were planted. These trees have reached maturity and restored some of the original atmosphere to the park. Establishment of the neighborhood The neighborhood surrounding Walnut Park was originally established by some of the social elite of Syracuse. Community leader and banker George Comstock, after donating the property for the park, chose carefully the people to whom he sold building lots. George H. Bond had the house at 304 Walnut Place built in 1899. He was Onondaga County District Attorney, and founder of the still existent law firm of Bond, Schoeneck and King. The house reflects elements of both the Queen Anne style popular up to that time and the Georgian Revival style becoming popular. The house was later owned by Syracuse University and known as \\"Blackwell Cottage\\". It is now the home of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. The house at 701 Walnut Place is now owned by Syracuse University and utilized as the Chancellor's residence. It was built for attorney William Nottingham in 1901. The house was designed in the Jacobethan Revival style by architects Brockway and Benson of New York City. Leather lines the library walls. The living room ceiling is decorated with Gothic tracery. The central staircase is carved. A ballroom graces the third floor. The chateauesque house next door at 703 Walnut Avenue was built for Crucible Steel owner and president Horace Wilkinson in 1905. Gaggin and Gaggin architects of Syracuse designed it. The interior woodworking is various and impressive. Theodore Roosevelt, while engaged in the Barnes-Roosevelt libel case, stayed there as a guest of the family for a month. The house belonged to Phi Delta Theta Fraternity for many years and now belongs to Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity, of which American radio and television personality Dick Clark was a member. Other notable Syracusans who built their homes in the neighborhood included clergyman and archbishop the Reverend Huntington, A. E. Nettleton, of the Nettleton Shoe Company and Paragon Plaster, and the Denison family. Fraternity-sorority row In 1915 the Alpha Phi sorority bought the house at 308 Walnut Place. Around 1921 the houses at 208 and 210 Walnut Place and the one at 901 Walnut Avenue all became sorority or fraternity houses. In 1923 house at 300 Walnut Place was sold to the Delta Delta Delta sorority. The house at 310 Walnut Place was built around 1925 for the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and the house at 803 Walnut Avenue was built for Gamma Phi Beta sorority. In 1928, Kappa Alpha Theta sorority had local architect Marjorie Wright design their Tudor style house at 306 Walnut Place. In 1937 the house at 907 Walnut Avenue also became the Kappa Delta sorority house. Over the following decades, more fraternities and sororities moved in, making the area the Fraternity/Sorority Row of Syracuse University. Block party Walnut Park was the traditional home of Syracuse University's \\"block party\\", an event celebrating the coming of spring with live entertainment in an outdoor setting. In 1993, amid concerns of over-crowding and excessive drinking, the University moved the event to a more readily controllable indoor venue.

It has two main Departments namely, the Department of Labour and the Department Social Services, which both consist of several divisions. The Department of Labour deals with Labour related issues through its divisions which are the labour relations division, labour research & economics division, international relations division, registration process division and the national employment services division. The Department of Social Services (DSS), which is the main focal point of the assignment, is responsible for finance and administration, rehabilitation, family and child welfare, and policy and programming. DSS, like many other government departments, was enormously affected by the economic decline, caused by the high Inflation rate which had peaked to 231 million per cent, characterized by high prices and unemployment which left 1.5 million households in poverty, homes to some 3.5 million children.National Action Plan for Orphans and Vulnerable Children II 2011 As economic growth declined in Zimbabwe, so did the labour absorptive capacity of the economy such that by 2004, four out of every five jobs in Zimbabwe were informalised, resulting in massive decent work deficits. Unemployment rates had remained below 10 per cent between 1982 and 2004.CSO, LFS, 2004 However, during the same period there was a decline in formal employment (from 1.1 million in 1993 to 990,000 in 2002), and a corresponding increase in informal employment.UN Country analysis Report 2010 The high unemployment rate led to a lack of professional expertise in different organisations following the exodus of qualified social workers as well as other professionals in search of greener pastures in neighbouring countries and abroad.

The exhibition was a well-known and popular example of \\"Victorian whimsy\\" for many years, even after Potter's death; however enthusiasm for such entertainments waned in the twentieth century, and his collection was finally dispersed in 2003.  Early life and popularity  Walter Potter's family ran The White Lion pub in Bramber. Potter left school at the age of fourteen and began creating taxidermy pieces as a way to encourage people to visit the family's establishment. His first attempt at taxidermy was to preserve the body of his own pet canary when he was a teenager. At the age of 19, inspired by his sister, Jane, who showed him an illustrated book of nursery rhymes, Potter produced what was to become the centrepiece of his museum, a diorama of \\"The Death and Burial of Cock Robin\\", which included 98 species of British birds. This was so well-received that in 1861, he opened a separate display in the summer house of the pub. While satisfying the Victorian demand for traditional stuffed animals to earn a living, Potter continued creating his dioramas and expanded into new premises in 1866, and again in 1880. As his museum expanded, Potter married a local girl, Ann Stringer Muzzell, and they had three children, Walter, Annie and Minnie. Potter's Rabbit School Amongst his scenes were \\"a rats' den being raided by the local police rats ... [a] village school ... featuring 48 little rabbits busy writing on tiny slates, while the Kittens' Tea Party displayed feline etiquette and a game of croquet. A guinea pigs' cricket match was in progress, and 20 kittens attended a wedding, wearing little morning suits or brocade dresses, with a feline vicar in white surplice.\\" Potter's attention to detail in these scenes has been noted, to the extent that \\"The kittens even wear frilly knickers under their formal attire!\\" Apart from the simulations of human situations, he had also added examples of bizarrely deformed animals such as two-headed lambs and four-legged chickens. Potter's collection, billed as \\"Mr Potter's Museum of Curiosities\\" was to build into a \\"world-famous example of Victorian whimsy\\", with special coach trips from Brighton being arranged; and the village and Potter's museum were so popular that an extension was built to the platform at Bramber railway station.  Later life, death, and decline of the museum  Potter suffered a stroke in 1914, from which he never fully recovered, and died at the age of 82; he was buried in Bramber churchyard. His museum, which by that time contained about 10,000 specimens, was taken over by his daughter and grandson. The Victorian enthusiasm for stuffed animals had waned by the museum's later days, and it deflected claims of animal cruelty by displaying notices stating that all the animals had died naturally and that \\"in any case, they were all over 100 years old\\". The \\"Kittens' Wedding\\" scene, the last created by Potter in 1890, was shown at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2001 as part of \\"The Victorian Vision\\" exhibition. Potter's Museum in Bramber The exhibits form the inspiration for the gothic thriller \\"The Taxidermist's Daughter\\" by Kate Mosse.https://www.orionbooks.co.uk/titles/kate-mosse/the-taxidermists- daughter/9781409153788/  Sale of the collection  The museum closed in the 1970s, and, after having been moved to Brighton and then to Arundel, was sold in 1984 to the owners of Jamaica Inn, Bolventor, Cornwall, where it attracted more than 30,000 visitors each year. The death of their taxidermist and economic considerations sapped the venture of its viability, and, when a buyer to maintain the collection intact did not come forward, it was auctioned by Bonhams in 2003, realizing over ¬£500,000. \\"The Kittens' Wedding\\" was sold for ¬£21,150, and \\"The Death and Burial of Cock Robin\\" was the highest-selling item of the sale, raising ¬£23,500. Present at the auction were Peter Blake, Harry Hill and David Bailey. A bid of ¬£1m offered by Damien Hirst for the entire collection had apparently been rejected by the auctioneers, and the owners sued Bonhams, arguing that this offer should have been accepted. Shortly after the auction, Hirst wrote to The Guardian citing some of Potter's limitations as a taxidermist, saying \\"You can see he knew very little about anatomy and musculature, because some of the taxidermy is terrible‚Äîthere's a kingfisher that looks nothing like a kingfisher\\" He also showed appreciation for the displays: \\"My own favourites are these tableaux: there's a kittens' wedding party, with all these kittens dressed up in costumes, even wearing jewellery. The kittens don't look much like kittens, but that's not the point. There's a rats' drinking party, too which puts a different construction on Wind in the Willows. And a group of hamsters playing cricket.\\" About the auction, Hirst said, \\"I've offered ¬£1m and to pay for the cost of the auctioneer's catalogue ‚Äì just for them to take it off the market and keep the collection intact ‚Äì but apparently, the auction has to go ahead. It is a tragedy.\\" The White Lion pub, home of Potter's collection, has now been renamed The Castle Hotel.

Donald Coster, was an Italian swindler whose criminal career spanned parts of three decades. His various crimes included tax fraud, bank fraud, and bootlegging. However, he is best known as the mastermind of the McKesson & Robbins scandal of 1938, one of the largest financial scandals ever perpetuated by a single person. Early life Musica was born in 1877 in Naples to Antonio and Maria Musica. He moved to New York City at the age of seven and grew up in Mulberry's Bend, a rough neighborhood in Little Italy. Philip would eventually have three brothers and a sister. As a boy, Musica admired Theodore Roosevelt, at the time the city's hard-charging police commissioner. First convictions for fraud A. Musica and Son Musica dropped out of school at the age of 14 to help out at his father's small grocery store, A. Musica and Son. Within two years, he was running the store. He soon left day-to-day operations to his younger brother Arthur while turning his own attention to building an import-export operation. By importing cheese, olive oil, and spices directly from Italy (as opposed to using a middleman), he was able to underprice his competitors. Within a few years, A. Musica and Son was one of the largest importers of Italian food in New York, grossing a half-million dollars a year. The Musicas moved to a home in Bay Ridge in Brooklyn and became leaders of the city's Italian community. There was a dark secret to the store's success, however. Musica bribed dock officials to replace the real bills of lading with phony ones listing the weights of their shipments as substantially lighter than they really were. The unpaid tariffs grew to astronomical proportions when the Musicas increased their orders. Combined with the lower prices they paid for importing directly, they substantially outsold all their competitors in Little Italy. However, in 1909 Mayor George B. McClellan Jr. began a drive to clean up the East River waterfront. Police soon discovered the fraud, and Philip and Antonio Musica were arrested for tax evasion, tax fraud, and bribery. Musica pleaded guilty in return for having the charges against his father dropped (even though his father had signed several of the phony invoices) and served a year in jail. However, President William Howard Taft pardoned him after only six months. U.S. Hair Not long after getting out of jail, Musica founded the United States Hair Company, ostensibly to sell hairpieces that fashionable women of the day used to create elaborate hairstyles. Good-quality hair sold for as much as $80 a pound. Musica had his mother gather up nearly worthless sweepings from barbershop floors. He then put them in crates with a layer of expensive hair on top. The money was soon rolling in again, and Musica moved his family to a larger house in Bay Ridge. He also bought a suite at the Knickerbocker Hotel. Musica sent his mother to Italy with the ostensible purpose of getting loans to finance the shipment of long strands of human hair across the Atlantic. The bankers bought the story, and Musica soon set up satellite offices around the world. However, these were nothing more than maildrops for the paper trail to support the existence of the company's nonexistent inventory. In July 1912, U.S. Hair was capitalized at $2 million, with $600,000 in assets‚Äîmostly human hair located abroad. Three months later, Musica took the company public, and it was listed on the Curb Exchange. The original price of $2 a share jumped to $10, making Musica an instant millionaire. Then just as fast as Musica rose, he fell‚Äîand this time almost as ignobly as he had three years before. By the time U.S. Hair went public, it was $500,000 in arrears to several banks. Two British banks got suspicious of U.S. Hair's financing and refused to honor some company drafts, sending U.S. Hair stock into a tailspin. To get as much money as possible out of the company before being unmasked, Musica sought a $370,000 loan from Bank of Manhattan (now part of JPMorgan Chase), pledging 216 crates of hair as collateral. However, a bank clerk discovered a bill of lading for Musica's collateral had been altered. Suspicious bank representatives went to the piers to inspect the hair and discovered that the crates held only a small layer of valuable hair. The rest of the contents were nearly worthless ends and short pieces. The total value of the contents in the warehouse was about $250. Musica got word that the bank had alerted federal authorities and proceeded to strip his Bay Ridge home of virtually everything of value. The Musica family fled to various cities on the East Coast before meeting in New Orleans. They got on a ship, intending to escape to Panama, but private detective William J. Burns was able to track them down by following a $12 steamer trunk Philip had bought at the Knickerbocker. Musica pleaded guilty in return for the dismissal of all charges against his family, claiming he'd been bilked by two European firms. Although the banks only recovered $70,000 of the $600,000 he'd swindled from them, he was able to curry favor with the authorities by informing on other inmates at The Tombs. Finally, in 1916, he was given a suspended sentence and released. He was then hired as a special investigator with the New York State Attorney General's office under the alias William Johnson. He spent most of the next three years chasing down suspected German spies and draft dodgers. However, his career ended when he tried to implicate William Randolph Hearst as a German collaborator. Musica was apparently trying to get back at Hearst for his unflattering coverage of the U.S. Hair scandal. First bootlegging venture In 1920, after briefly going into the poultry business, Musica founded the Adelphi Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Company, under the alias Frank D. Costa, with Joseph Brandino as his partner. Its nominal business was the manufacture of a hair tonic called \\"Dandrofuge\\" and cosmetics. In truth, it was a front for a bootlegging venture. In those days, hair tonic and cosmetics used large quantities of alcohol. Under the Prohibition laws, access to alcohol was strictly controlled, and Musica, as Costa, obtained a permit to draw 5,000 gallons of raw alcohol per month. Unlike U.S. Hair, Adelphi's business was very real. However, the great majority of Musica's profits came from bootleggers who bought his tonic in large quantities and distilled out the alcohol to make beer and liquor. With the high premiums earned from the bootleggers, Musica was once again rolling in money. He kept two sets of books‚Äîa phony one showing sales at the normal competitive price and a real one to account for the sales to bootleggers. Adelphi was shut down in 1923 after telling the Treasury that Brandino had been abusing the permit. Three years earlier, Musica had turned state's evidence against Brandino after the two were arrested for a Prohibition violation. McKesson & Robbins scam Girard & Co. Using the proceeds from Adelphi, Musica moved to the tiny suburb of Mount Vernon, New York in 1923, where he set up Girard & Co., another company that made Dandrofuge tonic. He also legally changed his name to Frank Donald Coster, or F. Donald Coster. He billed himself as a native of Washington, D.C., with an M.D. and Ph.D. from the University of Heidelberg. He claimed to have practiced medicine for only three years before going into business. Like Adelphi's business, Girard's hair tonic business was very real, but most of its profits were generated from bootleggers, who simply bought Coster's tonic in large quantities and distilled out the alcohol to make booze. The bootleggers paid far higher premiums than the drugstores that made up Girard's legitimate customer base. One of his biggest customers was Dutch Schultz. As in the past, Coster brought his family in on this latest scam. He claimed to be running the company for the widow and sister of Horace Girard‚Äîroles played by his mother and sister Grace, respectively. His brother Arthur, under the alias George Vernard, set up W.W. Smith & Co. On paper, it was a sales agency that handled a large volume of Girard orders. In truth, it was nothing more than a \\"letter- writing plant\\" that generated fake purchase orders and mailed them to Girard. Another brother, Robert, under the alias Robert Dietrich, was Girard's head of shipping. He forged the necessary documents to make it look like the inventory had actually been shipped out. Another brother, George, under the alias George Dietrich, served as company treasurer and moved money between accounts to make it look like the \\"customers\\" had paid for the \\"orders.\\" To lend his scheme greater legitimacy, Coster asked Price Waterhouse to audit Girard & Co. In those days, auditors didn't check inventories, but only checked a company's books and supporting documents. Relying entirely on fraudulent documents provided by Girard, Price Waterhouse listed the company as having $1.1 million in sales, profits of $250,000 and assets of $295,000. When it examined W. W. Smith & Co., Girard's biggest customer, Price Waterhouse relied on the faked purchase orders as well as a forged report from Dun & Company (now part of Dun & Bradstreet) stating that W. W. Smith was worth $7 million. The scheme succeeded with flying colors, and Coster soon moved the company to Fairfield, Connecticut. Also, he and his wife Carol (whom he had married after wrecking her previous marriage to a business associate) moved to an 18-room, seven-acre estate in Fairfield. While it was an open secret that Girard was really a bootlegging operation‚Äîin fact, it was the biggest bootleg distributor on the East Coast‚ÄîCoster's ties to Connecticut politics and business, as well as his talent for bribery, kept any investigations from going anywhere. Buying McKesson Coster wanted to become a major player on Wall Street and saw his chance when he found out that McKesson & Robbins, a well-respected drugmaker and distributor, was up for sale. He also wanted to avert any suspicion of his real activities. In 1926, he merged Girard & Co. with McKesson for $1 million. While McKesson was the surviving company, Coster became the merged company's president. The McKesson purchase gave Coster an even larger front for his bootlegging operation. However, he also pumped up McKesson's legitimate business and led a drive to open up several foreign markets. During his first full year as company president, 1927, he incorporated a Canadian subsidiary to trade in crude drugs. Unlike the rest of the company, only Coster and George Dietrich‚Äîbetter known as George Musica‚Äîhad access to the accounts of this new division. That year, the company turned a $600,000 profit. Coster grew even richer, buying a 28-room mansion in Fairfield, a yacht, racing horses, a stable of cars, and a castle in Monroe, Connecticut. His machine continued to roll through the Great Depression until by 1937, McKesson was the third- largest drug company in the world. However, he remained an intensely private man, in part out of fear of being unmasked. For instance, he turned down an offer to run for president in 1936 on the Republican ticket. Collapse Coster's downfall began in 1937, when McKesson's board ordered him to convert $2 million of his crude drugs into cash to build up profits and reduce outstanding debt. Coster responded with a demand that the firm obtain a $3 million loan \\"for improvements.\\" Julian Thompson, the company's treasurer, was puzzled by this demand. He figured a firm as successful as McKesson shouldn't need to obtain an outside loan. Several aspects of the company's arrangement with W. W. Smith and Co.--which had been inherited from the Girard merger‚Äîalso troubled him. On a hunch, he contacted Dun & Bradstreet, who informed him W. W. Smith's report was a forgery. He also discovered that the crude-drug division was more or less nonexistent and that, in 1929, Coster had looted the division of $640,000 to cover losses on the stock market. Altogether, Thompson discovered Coster had stolen $3 million from McKesson over the years. When Thompson confronted Coster with his findings, Coster accused him of \\"trying to wreck this company.\\" He then tried to place the company in equity receivership to throw Thompson off the scent long enough to cover up the fraud. However, Thompson countered by having the board file for bankruptcy protection under the Chandler Act. After an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Coster, Vernard, and George Dietrich were arrested and released on bail on December 13. An investigator with the New York state attorney general's office thought he recognized Coster's face as that of former investigator William Johnson‚Äîthe alias Musica had used after his release from The Tombs. A check revealed Coster's fingerprints to be an exact match to those of Musica. At a midnight press conference on December 15, officials dropped a bombshell‚ÄîF. Donald Coster, the now-disgraced drug tycoon, was really two-time convicted fraudster Philip Musica. Musica got word that he'd been unmasked and that federal marshals were on their way to arrest him. Unwilling to face almost certain conviction and a long prison term, he locked himself in the bathroom and shot himself in the head on the morning of December 16. He was careful to stand in a way that when he fell into a large marble bathtub, none of his blood stained the carpet on the floor. Nazi Propaganda Musica was mentioned in the 1938 Nazi pamphlet Roosevelt verr√§t Amerika! (Roosevelt Betrays America!) by Dr. Robert Ley. He wrote \\"The Coster- Musica scandal aroused considerable excitement in the American business world at the end of 1938. Coster-Musica had carried out swindles on a widespread scale, including drug smuggling, weapons sales, and crooked dealings, and was a member of many prominent clubs. Coster-Musica had been in jail for fraud as early as 1906. He was convicted in a huge financial scandal in 1913. Given his connections to 'high society,' he did not serve time in prison. His company collapsed when the fraud was discovered. 13,500 stockholders lost over $100 million. He committed suicide because he feared his well-placed friends were no longer able to protect him from the wrath of those he had cheated.\\" References *Messing, Brett; Steven Sugarman, James J.

Design and development  A new, fully enclosed, and heavily armored boxy casemate superstructure was built on the chassis of the Sturmgesch√ºtz III. It mounted the improved sIG 33/1 infantry gun, offset to the right side, for which 30 rounds were carried. It could only traverse 3¬∞ left and right, elevate 25¬∞, and depress 6¬∞. A MG 34 machine-gun was fitted in a ball mount to the right of the main gun with 600 rounds. Its traverse limits were 15¬∞ left and 20¬∞ right, and it could elevate 20¬∞ and depress 10¬∞. Sources differ as to the development history. Chamberlain and Doyle say that Alkett was ordered in July 1941 to convert a dozen Sturmgesch√ºtz III Ausf. E chassis and that these were finished in December 1941 and January 1942 - but not issued. On 20 September 1942, another dozen Sturmgeschutz IIIs were ordered to be converted, and the existing vehicles were rebuilt.pp. 81, 87 Trojca and Jaugitz contend that all twenty-four were built by Alkett starting in September 1942 from repaired Sturmgesch√ºtz III Ausf. B, C, D and E chassis.p. 5  Combat history  The first dozen were delivered by the end of October 1942 and assigned to Sturmgesch√ºtz-Abteilungen (Assault Gun Battalions) 177 and 244, then fighting in Stalingrad. The remaining dozen vehicles could not be delivered to Sturmgesch√ºtz-Abteilungen 243 and 245, also fighting in Stalingrad, after the Soviets surrounded the German 6th Army on 21 November. Instead, the vehicles were formed into Sturm-Infanterie-Gesch√ºtz- Batterie/Lehr-Bataillon (Assault Infantry Gun Batterie/Demonstration Battalion) XVII. The battalion was assigned to the 22nd Panzer Division as the Germans attempted to relieve the trapped 6th Army. The Division was virtually wiped out in the fighting and the battery was assigned to the 23rd Panzer Division where it became the Sturm-Infanterie-Gesch√ºtz-Batterie/Panzer- Regiment 201 (also known as 9. Kompanie/Panzer-Regiment 201) for the rest of the war. The last strength report to mention them lists five remaining in September 1944.

Built in 1895 by the Boston and Maine Railroad, it is one of two surviving train stations in the town, and the only one still at its original site. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 as Boston and Maine Railroad Depot. It is now used for commercial purposes. Description and history 1913 postcard of the station The railroad depot is located two blocks east of its Central Square, at the northeast corner of Franklin and Pine Streets. It is a single-story brick building resting on a granite foundation, with a shallow-hipped roof whose extended eaves are supported by large brackets. The roof is pierced by cross gables which have fanlight windows that have been blocked up. It is oriented with its long facade facing Pine Street, with the former railroad right-of-way on the other side (now used for parking on this parcel, and not readily evident in adjacent parcels). Stoneham's first railroad station was built at Farm Hill in 1861, and a wood-frame gambrel-roofed station was built on this site in 1863; both of these were built by the Boston and Lowell Railroad. The present station building was constructed in 1895 by the Boston and Maine, successor to the Boston and Lowell. It was estimated to cost $28,000 (). The Farm Hill station building still stands, but has been moved from its site to Central Street and converted into a residence. The railroad played an important role in Stoneham's transition from a modest industrial center to a commuter suburb of Boston.

(3 September 1932 ‚Äì 26 September 2014) was an American astronomer known for his pioneering work in infrared astronomy. Neugebauer was born in G√∂ttingen, Germany and is the son of Otto Neugebauer, an Austrian-American mathematician and historian of science, and Grete Bruck. After moving to the United States at age seven, he received his B.A. in physics from Cornell University in 1954 and his Ph.D. in physics from Caltech in 1960, with a thesis on the photoproduction of negative and positive pions from deuterium. During his military service with the U.S. Army he was stationed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and worked for the Ordnance Corps until 1962. He joined the Caltech faculty in 1962 as an assistant professor, becoming a full professor of physics in 1970. He was named Howard Hughes Professor in 1985 and Chairman of the Division of Physics, Math and Astronomy in 1988. At the time of his death, he was the Robert Andrews Millikan Professor of Physics, Emeritus and an adjunct faculty member of the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory. Neugebauer served as the director of the Palomar Observatory from 1980 to 1994. Neugebauer was active in infrared astronomy, and played a leading role in infrared studies of the planets. In addition‚Äîand largely through his activities with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) and the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC)‚Äîhe led both ground- and space- based infrared studies of the stars, the Milky Way and other galaxies. Observations by him and his colleagues at Mount Wilson and Palomar observatories revealed thousands of infrared sources in the sky, and afforded the first infrared view of the galactic center. Together with Robert B. Leighton, he completed the Two-Micron Sky Survey, the first infrared survey of the sky, which cataloged more than 5,000 infrared sources. Together with Eric Becklin, he discovered the Becklin‚ÄìNeugebauer Object, an intense source of infrared radiation in the Orion Nebula that is one of the brightest objects in the sky at wavelengths less than 10 micrometres. Neugebauer played a role in the design and construction of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Among Neugebauer's numerous awards are two NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medals (1972, 1984), the 1985 Space Science Award of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the 1985 Richmyer Lecture Award, the 1986 Rumford Prize, the 1996 Henry Norris Russell Lectureship, the 1998 Herschel Medal, and the 2010 Bruce Medal. He was named California Scientist of the Year for 1986 by the California Museum of Science and Industry, and he was elected to the National Academy of the Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Royal Astronomical Society. Neugebauer was married to the geophysicist Marcia Neugebauer, a pioneer in solar wind research at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the two resided in Tucson, Arizona. He died on 26 September 2014 in Tucson, due to spinocerebellar ataxia.https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/03/us/gerry-neugebauer- pioneer-in-space-studies-dies-at-82.html?_r=0 Prizes * 1986 Rumford Prize * 1996 Henry Norris Russell Lectureship * 1998 Herschel Medal * 2010 Bruce Medal Notes External links * New Eyes on the Universe: 400 Years of Physicist Astronomers * Gerry Neugebauer - Encyclop√¶dia Britannica * Gerry Neugebauer - Biography, The American Philosophical Society Category:American astronomers Category:American physicists Category:California Institute of Technology alumni Category:Cornell University alumni Category:1932 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Category:United States Army personnel Category:Members of the American Philosophical Society Category:People from G√∂ttingen ","title":"Gerry Neugebauer"},{"id":"21540759","text":"Janda√≠ra is the easternmost city in the Brazilian state of Bahia.

A typical listicle will prominently feature a cardinal number in its title, with subsequent subheadings within the text itself reflecting this schema. The word is a portmanteau derived from list and article. It has also been suggested that the word evokes \\"popsicle\\", emphasising the fun but \\"not too nutritious\\" nature of the listicle. A ranked listicle (such as Rolling Stones \\"The 100 Best Albums of the Last Twenty Years\\") implies a qualitative judgement, conveyed by the order of the topics within the text. These are often presented in countdown order, and the \\"Number One\\" item is the last in the sequence. Other listicles impart no such values, instead presenting the topics in no particular order, although they may be grouped by theme. Media While conventional reportage and essay-writing often require the careful crafting of narrative flow, the building-block nature of the listicle lends itself to more rapid production. It can also be a means of \\"recycling\\" information, as often it is the context, not the content, that is original. For example, one can construct a listicle by adding captions to YouTube clips. For these reasons, the form has come under criticism as a \\"kind of cheap content-creation\\": > It's so easy you wonder why everyone doesn't do it until you realize that > now it's all they do: Come up with an idea (\\"Top 10 Worst [X]\\") on the L > train ride to the office that morning, [and] slap together 10 (or 25, or > 100) cultural artifacts ripe for the kind of snarky working over that won't > actually tax you at all as a writer/thinker. The blogger and technologist Anil Dash has disparaged the proliferation of listicles, particularly within the blogosphere, characterizing them in 2006 as the \\"geek equivalents of Cosmo coverlines\\". Nevertheless, the form remains a mainstay of the newsstand and of the web. The covers of magazines such as Cosmopolitan and Men's Journal regularly sport at least one, if not several listicles. In 2009 postings in the format \\"25 Random Things About Me\\" became an internet phenomenon, starting on Facebook but spreading to the broader web, and attracting considerable media coverage in the process. Some websites, such as BuzzFeed, generate hundreds of listicles daily. Steven Poole has suggested the form has literary precursors like Jorge Luis Borges's \\"The Analytical Language of John Wilkins\\", and compares it to more high-art versions like Umberto Eco's The Infinity of Lists, a book composed entirely of lists.

Jonathan Green, a prominent citizen of Stoneham, who served as town clerk and treasurer, and represented the town at a Constitutional Convention to consider a constitution reported in the summer of 1787 by the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. In 1825 and 1826 the house served as the Stoneham school house. In 1853 following the annexation of land in Stoneham to become the Melrose Highlands, this house and several others near the town line were granted the privilege of sending children occupants to school within the town of Melrose.

The bill designates millions of acres in the US as protected and establishes a National Landscape Conservation System. It includes funding for programs, studies and other activities by the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture, and in some cases bars further geothermal leasing, oil and gas leasing, and new mining patents on certain stretches of protected land. Legislative history 110th Congress On June 26, 2008, Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico introduced the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2008 (). Although the bill had some support from both Democrats and Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate never voted on the measure due to threats by Senator Tom Coburn (R-Oklahoma) to filibuster the bill. 111th Congress =S. 22= On January 7, 2009, Bingaman introduced the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 (), a new bill which incorporated 159 bills that had been considered by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources during the 110th Congress and, in some cases, earlier Congresses.C-SPAN Despite vehement opposition from Coburn and some other Republicans, the Senate passed a cloture motion on January 11 by a vote of 66‚Äì12Vote 1, via Senate.gov and then passed the bill on January 15 by a vote of 73‚Äì21, with four members not voting.Vote 3, via Senate.gov The bill was then sent to the House of Representatives, where it was expected to pass by a wide margin. The bill was held at the desk instead of being sent to a committee. On March 11, 2009, the House considered the bill under suspension of the rules, meaning that a two- thirds vote would be required for passage. Those voting in favor of the bill (predominantly Democrats) fell two votes short of a two-thirds majority, 282-144. 34 Republicans voted in favor of the bill, while three Democrats voted against it: Dan Boren of Oklahoma, Jim Marshall of Georgia, and Collin Peterson of Minnesota.Roll Call 117, via House.gov House Democrats could then have brought the bill back to the floor under regular procedure, which would have allowed Republicans to submit amendments to the bill. The bill, as voted on by the House, had been amended by Jason Altmire (D-Pennsylvania), to prohibit the closing of the lands described in the bill to hunting and fishing, presumably to persuade sportsmen and hunters to vote for the bill. =H.R. 146= On March 3, 2009, the House of Representatives passed a bill under suspension of the rules, the Revolutionary War and War of 1812 Battlefield Protection Act (), 394-13. On March 12, one day after the House failed to pass the Omnibus Public Land Management Act, Reid announced that he would file cloture on H.R. 146.

Title II Title II establishes a National Landscape Conservation System, to include Bureau of Land Management-administered National Monuments, National Conservation Areas, Wilderness Study Areas, components of the National Trails System, components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and components of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Title II also designates four new National Conservation Areas (Fort Stanton ‚Äì Snowy River Cave National Conservation Area, Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area, Red Cliffs National Conservation Area in Washington County, Utah, and Dominguez-Escalante National Conservation Area) and one new National Monument (the Prehistoric Trackways National Monument in the Robledo Mountains of New Mexico). It also transfers lands in Nevada, Utah, Idaho, and Washington to federal control. Title III Title III authorizes the United States Secretary of Agriculture to, through the Chief of the United States Forest Service, conduct studies in the interest of preserving open space in southern Colorado and deliver \\"an annual report on the wildland firefighter safety practices...including training programs and activities for wildland fire suppression, prescribed burning, and wildland fire use, during the preceding calendar year.\\" Title III also prohibits further oil and gas leasing, geothermal leasing, and mining patents in a stretch of the Bridger-Teton National Forest; this provision was based on a bill being crafted by Senator Craig L. Thomas of Wyoming before his death. Title IV Title IV authorizes the Chief of the Forest Service to solicit (from regional foresters) nominations of forest landscapes of at least , primarily consisting of national forest lands, which are in need of \\"active ecosystem restoration,\\" for the carrying out of ecological restoration treatments. The Chief, acting on behalf of the Secretary of Agriculture, then may select up to ten of these proposals, aided by a fifteen-member advisory board, to be funded in any given fiscal year. For each proposal selected, 50% of the expenditures of the execution and monitoring of ecological restoration treatments would be paid for by a Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund in the United States Treasury. However, each proposal's expenditures are limited to $4 million per year. Title V Title V designates thousands of miles of new additions to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. It also adds six trails to the National Trails System: the Arizona National Scenic Trail, the New England National Scenic Trail, the Ice Age Floods National Geologic Trail, the Washington‚ÄìRochambeau Revolutionary Route National Historic Trail, the Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail and the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail. Title VI Title VI creates a number of new United States Department of the Interior programs. One of these programs, the Wolf Livestock Loss Demonstration Project, gives states and Indian tribes federal grants to help livestock producers to reduce livestock loss due to predation by wolves in non-lethal ways, as well as for the purpose of compensating livestock producers for their loss of livestock due to predation by wolves. Another part of Title VI, the Paleontological Resources Preservation Act, was originally a Senate bill introduced in 2007 by Daniel Akaka (D-Hawaii). This provision establishes stronger penalties than previously required for nonpermitted removal of scientifically significant fossils from federal lands. The provision was endorsed and strongly supported by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, an international association of professional and amateur vertebrate paleontologists. In contrast, the Association of Applied Paleontological Sciences, an association of commercial fossil dealers, opposed the measure. Title VII Title VII makes three additions to the National Park System and expands current National Park designations. It also authorizes an American Battlefield Protection Program, a Preserve America program, a Save America's Treasures Program, and a Route 66 Corridor Preservation Program, all to be carried out by the National Park Service. New National Park System components would include: *Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park in Paterson, New Jersey *President William Jefferson Clinton Birthplace Home National Historic Site in Hope, Arkansas *River Raisin National Battlefield Park in Frenchtown, Michigan Title VIII Title VIII designates ten new National Heritage Areas at the cost of $103.5 million: *Sec. 8001.

Title IX Title IX authorizes three new studies to examine new reclamation projects under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Reclamation. It also creates 15 new water and endangered fish projects in four states. Furthermore, Title IX puts some federal water reclamation facilities under local control and funds conservation efforts. Title X Title X codifies the settlements of three water disputes in California, Nevada, and New Mexico, in an effort to resolve decades of litigation. Title XI Title XI reauthorizes the National Geologic Mapping Act of 1992 at a cost of $64 million per year through the year 2018. It furthermore authorizes groundwater surveys in New Mexico, also by the U.S. Geological Survey. Title XII Title XII creates five new oceanic observation, research, and exploration programs at a cost of $2.6 billion, including programs for undersea research, undersea and coastal mapping, acidification research, and ocean conservation. One provision, the Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System Act, would \\"establish a national integrated System of ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes observing systems, Federal and non-Federal components coordinated at the national level by the National Ocean Research Leadership Council\\" in order to \\"support national defense, marine commerce, navigation safety, weather, climate, and marine forecasting, energy siting and production, economic development, ecosystem-based marine, coastal, and Great Lakes resource management, public safety, and public outreach training and education.\\" Title XIII Title XIII deals with miscellaneous bills, including one that funds the National Tropical Botanical Garden in Hawaii and another that increases the number of Assistant Energy Secretaries in the United States Department of Energy to eight. Title XIII also amends the Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Act of 2000 and the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act. Title XIV Title XIV, the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, provides $105 million over five years for coordinated paralysis research by the National Institutes of Health.

Built about 1875, it is one a few surviving Italianate houses on Main Street south of Central Square, which was once lined with elegant houses. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It now houses professional offices. Description and history The house stands on the west side of Main Street (Massachusetts Route 28), between Linden and Gerry Street. Just to its north stands the nearly identical Onslow Gilmore House. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with an L-shaped floorplan that includes a porch in the crook of the L. The porch originally sheltered a double door, but part of the porch has been enclosed, and the original door replaced by a single smaller one. The house has also been clad in aluminum, but much of the Italianate detailing, including bracketed cornices, ornate window lintels, and ornately boxed bay windows, has been retained. The house lot also retains original stone curbing and posts at the sidewalk edges on both Main and Gerry Streets. The house may have been built by Onslow Gilmore, a prominent local businessman, banker, and real estate developer, as a speculative venture. Its first documented owner was Clara Buswell, in 1889. Houses similar to these were built in large numbers on Main Street after the American Civil War; these two are among the few that survive.

It includes the town's largest concentration of 19th and early-20th century commercial architecture, in an area that developed in importance as a commercial center after the construction of the Andover-Medford Turnpike (now Main Street, designated Massachusetts Route 28). The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The town of Stoneham is located north of the city of Boston, and is now predominantly a commuter suburb. In the mid-19th century the town developed as a major center of shoemaking in the area, and was served by the Boston and Lowell Railroad and the turnpike heading north to Andover. The shoemaking enterprises began as small-scale enterprises, which gradually became centralized into larger operations. One factory remains from this period, the large 1858 Italianate building at 426 Main Street, which was built by John Hill and was the town's first major industrial building. The triangular junction of Main Street and Center Street became the commercial hub of the town, its character defined by three Second Empire buildings erected between 1868 and 1890: the Dow Block, the Oddfellows Building, and the Chase Block. The southern end of the district is anchored by the Hill factory building and the 1904 Stoneham Public Library, just across Main Street. Just north of the square stand other municipal buildings, including the 1918 Central Firestation, and town hall, built in 1939 on the east side of Center Street. North of these buildings are a cluster of churches, marking the northern edge of the district at Common Street. These include the First Congregational Church (1840) and the First Unitarian Church (1869).

They add to the function of the luciferins whose usual light- producing reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme luciferase. History The marine worm Chaetopterus was the source of the first photoprotein to be discovered. The term photoprotein was first used to describe the unusual chemistry of the luminescent system of Chaetopterus (a marine Polychaete worm).Shimomura, O. \\"Bioluminescence: Chemical Principles and Methods\\" World Scientific Publishing Co., 2006. This was meant to distinguish them from other light-producing proteins because these do not exhibit the usual luciferin- luciferase reaction.Harvey, E.N. \\"Bioluminescence\\" Academic Press., 1952. Reaction kinetics Photoproteins do not display typical enzyme kinetics as seen in luciferases. Instead, when mixed with luciferin, they display luminescence proportional to the amount of the photoprotein. For example, the photoprotein aequorin produces a flash of light when luciferin and calcium are added, rather than the prolonged glow that is seen for luciferases when luciferin is added. In this respect, it may appear that photoproteins are not enzymes, when in fact they do catalyze their bioluminescence reactions. This is due to a fast catalytic step, which produces the light, and a slow regeneration step, where the oxyluciferin is freed and another molecule of luciferin is then enabled to bind to the enzyme. Because of the kinetically slow step, each aequorin molecule must \\"recharge\\" with another molecule of luciferin before it can emit light again, and this makes it appear as though it is not behaving as a typical enzyme. Photoproteins form a stable luciferin- photoprotein complex, often until the addition of another required factor such as Ca2+ in the case of aequorin.

The aim of the project was to reduce pressure on the rainforest and combat poverty among its inhabitants, most of them being Mayan Indians and subsistence peasants.  Plan and objectives  Prodesis is an abbreviation of the Spanish name for the programme: Proyecto de Desarrollo Social Integrado y Sostenible, Chiapas, Mexico (Integrated and Sustainable Social Development Project, Chiapas, Mexico). Its overall objectives were: # poverty reduction among the inhabitants of the Lacandon region # reduction of the pressure on the natural resources and mitigation of environmental degradation # reformulation of social development policies in Chiapas, with emphasis on participative and sustainable territorial development These goals should stimulate a sense of citizenship, and enhance the relation between the Chiapas government and the 155,000 inhabitants of the 830 communities located around the protected area of the Lacandon Jungle: the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve. This population, which is mainly indigenous and rural, has the highest levels of poverty and marginalization in the State of Chiapas, and of Mexico as a whole. Prodesis was a continuation the Integral Programme for the Sustainable Development of the Selva Lacandon Forest (PIDSS), which in turn was a continuation of Plan Ca√±adas. As re-formulated on start-up in 2003, Prodesis focussed on 16 of the 34 micro-regions identified by PIDSS. These \\"micro-regions\\" were defined by suitability for particular approaches to social and economic development and included Agua Azul, Avellanal, Amador Hern√°ndez, Betania, Benemerito de las Am√©ricas, Carmen Villaflores, Comunidad Lacandona, Damasco, Francisco I Madero, Maravilla Tenejapa, Marqu√©s de Comillas, Nah√°, Nuevo Francisco Le√≥n, Nuevo Huixt√°n, Rio Blanco, and Santo Domingo.  Financing, organization, implementation and evaluation  The project was a cooperation between the state of Chiapas and the European Union (EU), and was budgeted for ‚Ç¨31,000,000, of which ‚Ç¨16,000,000 was invested by the state of Chiapas. The EU contributed ‚Ç¨15,000,000 through EuropeAid. The European project (or agreement) code is ALA/B7-310/2003/5756. The history of PRODESIS stretches back to 1996 when a mission of 4 consultants visited Mexico and carried out an area appraisal to prepare a proposal for a Euro 5 million project to be carried out between SEMARNAP and the EC (Teyssier, Capietto and de Agostini, 1996). In late 1998 SEMARNAP responded to a set of key issues that had been raised by the EC Delegation in 1997, presented a reformulated proposal and requested that renewed consideration be given to the Project. The 1996 proposal was appraised by a further mission, carried out in September 1999, made up of Dr. Alastair White (anthropologist and socioeconomist) and Torsten Mark Kowal (rural development forester and climate/environmental scientist), working for LTS Consultants, Scotland, UK. They reported on the ongoing feasibility of the Project as designed in 1996 through: (i) fact-finding to identify substantive changes in the socio-economic and political context; (ii) analysis of the logic and applicability of the original approach; (iii) appraisal of the probability of fulfilment of basic conditions, identified in 1996 as prerequisites for successful project implementation. The re-designed project was proposed to EU Aide Attaches in Sept 1999 and to EuropeAid in Brussels. The main points in the re-design were to require local project-orientated planning processes within all components to supersede the ambitious participatory planning component proposed in 1996; and emphasis was placed on defining options for achievable changes in land-use, for training specific groups in the alternative land use and microenterprises options, and for linking up community-level projects with credit and other funding sources. From 2000 to 2003 the project then awaited improvements in the social and political context, as well as due process by the EC and the Mexican Government. The go-ahead for Prodesis was agreed in 2001. Preparations and consultations started in 2002, and the final contract was signed December 2003. Following formal approval, given all the elapsed time, it was necessary to re-design the project yet again, and this was done by Dieter Paas and Arturo Arreola, once the project was tendered for European Technical Assistance in 2003. However, it is unclear how far the White/Kowal recommendations were accepted; nor is it evident how many of the changes proposed in 1999 to the 1996 proposal were then taken on board during the 2003 re-design once the project formally started up. No internet references exist that describe these inputs and their role. The project started in 2004 and initially was expected to run until 2007, but due to delays related to modifications of the project plan and financial issues between the EU and Mexico, the project then continued for an extra year until September 2008. Prodesis was carried out by SeDeSol (Secretariat of Social Development of the State of Chiapas), and its director was Rodolfo Diaz Sarvide. Christian Bouteille was the (European) head of the International Technical Assistance. The European Delegation in Mexico-City was responsible for the European involvement in the project. Despite some progress and the benefits resulting from the Prodesis investment, in 2008 a classified evaluation report, ordered by the European Commission, and conducted by IBF International Consulting in collaboration with B.A.a Consultors (Piero Di Giacinto, Jan Karremans, Thomas Pijnenburg) concluded that Prodesis had not achieved all its objectives. These strong criticisms were summarised by independent sources and can be read here or here . A further clear set of criticisms are summarised here that take Prodesis as a case study. On the 13th and 14 October 2008 the 8th meeting of the Joint Committee (established Under the EU-Mexico Economic Partnership) Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement (Global Agreement) was held in Mexico City. Regarding the session on cooperation it was stated that: > \\"Both parties took note of the progress achieved in current projects in the > fields of social development, economic cooperation and science and > technology. The parties furthermore underlined the positive results of > PRODESIS implementation and agreed to explore the possibility of continuing > it with a second phase in the 2007-2013 Cooperation Programme.\\" In early 2009 it was decided that Prodesis was not going to be continued with a second phase in the Cooperation Programme.  Historical background of European involvement  Prodesis was signed within the framework of the Free Trade Agreement and Association Agreement between the European Union and Mexico: > \\"The new agreement should lead to liberalization of trade and investment > between Mexico and the EU [...but also to...] greater social equality and a > political system that is genuinely democratic and pluralist and respects > human rights. [...] This agreement opens the door to a wide range of > potential cooperation activities between the parties, and will allow the EU > to provide Mexico with financial and technical assistance for such social > programmes as action against poverty, regional development, and cooperation > in the field of human rights and protection of indigenous communities. [...] > With regard to the current political context in Mexico, the discussions on > the new agreement are going hand-in-hand in Mexico with a complex internal > political process of democratization and reform. [...] The process of reform > currently underway is also being hindered by a range of other factors such > as [...] the conflict in Chiapas, the activities of guerilla movements in a > number of other areas and the human rights situation, one of the most > dramatic recent examples being the massacre which occurred in Acteal on 22 > December 1997 and which was strongly condemned by Parliament in its > resolution of 15 January 1998. [...] The 1997 agreements [...] include a > democracy clause or human rights clause as an essential component. This was > a stumbling block to the signing of the framework agreement in 1991. > Nevertheless, the difficulties which have arisen in the context of the > transition process in Mexico have highlighted the importance of the > democracy clause. [...] Parliament therefore considered it vital that the > democracy clause be included in the new agreement and that the applicability > of the agreement would be conditional on strict respect for that clause.\\"  Criticism of Prodesis  On January 23, 2004 an article in the Mexican newspaper La Jornada reported that in the community of Nuevo San Rafael in the Lacandon forest, 23 houses were burned down and that the victims were chased into the jungle. February 3 Mexican news magazine Proceso suggested a link with a cooperation programme between Mexico and the EU. On several Indymedia- sites and other news and community sites around the world it was soon suggested that the violence was perpetrated by the Mexican Army against the Zapatista Ch'ol tribe, and that the EU was involved in relation to Plan Puebla Panam√°. Before the project even got started Prodesis was already accused of being a counter-insurgency project aimed at getting rid of the local population to gain control over the regions' natural resources. Based on this information Member of the European Parliament Erik Meijer posed a question (E-0546/04, 26-2-2004) to the European Commission (see below). Since early 2004 numerous critical articles (varying in factuality) about Prodesis have been published in Mexican newspapers (mainly La Jornada), magazines (Proceso , Contral√≠nea ), and on websites of local and international NGO's. On the 9th of February 2007 58 representants of communities in the Lacandon region signed the Declaration of Moxviquil in which they demanded the project to be suspended. The most important reasons stated in the document were that they were not properly informed about the project, which is a violation of ILO convention 169 and the Mexican Constitution (art.2). Another reason was that they did not see any serious effort in real social development, only some subsidies for cement, tin roofs, chickens and crops. After they had offered the declaration to the director of Prodesis and the head of the European Delegation in Mexico-City, some of those who signed the declaration were threatened by Prodesis staff: if they would stand by their signature, they would not receive any kind of government support anymore (like opportunidades or procampo).  Historical background and previous development projects  Also please see more about the socio-political context in the Lacandon region, and the predecessor-projects of Prodesis, Chiapas conflict. Until the 1950s, the Selva Lacandona covered an area of about 1.3 million hectares (13,000 km2). By the mid-1990s the pristine forest had been reduced to about 400,000 or at most 450,000 ha. The Lacand√≥n Indians, who until the 1950s were the still the only inhabitants of the Selva Lacandona, were then only about 600 persons, having been reduced from much larger numbers by the diseases brought in the late nineteenth century to which they had no immunity, brought by the mahogany cutters who first penetrated the area. The Lacandones by late last century numbered about 800. Due to demographic pressure, since the late 1950s and especially in the 1970s, about 80,000 other Indians originating in the highlands of Chiapas have occupied parts of the forest area. They are mainly Tzeltals (56% of the present population), with some Tojolabales (17%), Chols (11%) and Tzotzils (2%). The small Maya Lacand√≥n communities were outside the monetary economy until recent decades and their main monetary income today comes from the sale of craft items. In 1972, as part of a state government manoeuvre in relation to timber extraction, the Lacandones were granted formal ownership of the 614,000 hectares of the ‚ÄòBienes Comunales Lacandones‚Äô then established, but in 1978 were obliged to share this with some 15,000 Tzeltal and Chol settlers then granted communal rights. The majority of Lacandones do not possess cattle so have little negative impact on the forest, whereas in all the other communities, a better-off part of the population owns some beef- cattle, constituting an important form of saving and investment. Cattle are managed extensively, each head requiring about a hectare of land, and forest areas are frequently converted to pasture. Marqu√©s de Comillas, previously part of the Selva Lacandona forest, began to be settled by the same Indian groups in the 1970s. Then it was colonised in 1974-86 by settlers coming largely from other Mexican states, though the ejidos that were then formed absorbed the already-settled Tzeltal and other Chiapas Indian groups. Some 10-15% of the total population of the Selva Lacandona area are now mestizos (non-Indians) concentrated in Marqu√©s de Comillas. At the time of settlement, the only communications were by river and by air, and some of the settlers left in the early years finding themselves unsuited to the pioneer life. As a result of the early unattractiveness of the area, the generation of settlers was able to obtain larger areas of land than the 20 hectares usually available to ejidatarios (heads of family on land distributed under the Mexican agrarian reform laws) elsewhere, with 50 hectares a common allocation. However, the interior of the Marqu√©s de Comillas triangle remains poorly served by roads, and this has affected the growth of the communities where substantial concentrations of poverty are still found. Between about 1958 and 1986, both the Chiapas State and Federal governments either actively or passively favoured migration to ‚Äúundeveloped‚Äù forest-land. The Chiapas state government looked favourably upon the migration of Indians to the Selva Lacandona, as it tended to reduce the pressure on land and particularly the demands for land reforms in parts of Chiapas where a latifundio system predominated. In the early 1960s and in 1974-86 two periods of federal government-sponsored colonisation occurred, the latter focused on Marqu√©s de Comillas. This was a question of relieving pressures on the land elsewhere in the country. Until 1986, government policy was by no means clearly oriented to protecting the forest. State-led exploitation of the forest‚Äôs precious woods was managed by COFOLASA/CORFO during the 1970s and 80s (cedar and particularly mahogany), as against private companies with largely North American capital who first entered the region in the 1850s. Valuable timber was extracted in this period from areas within the areas formally owned by the Comunidad Lacandona, as well as from Marqu√©s de Comillas, as COFOLASA/CORFO was most active during the period of maximum conversion of forest for agriculture as colonisation proceeded. Between the mid-1970s and 1986 agricultural and forestry policies continued to be inconsistent. Government statements and actions included both support for maintaining the forest (e.g. the proclamation of the Biosphere Reserve of Montes Azules in 1978); and support for activities which would have the opposite effect (e.g. legalisation of landholdings on the western side of the forest, and the opening-up of Marqu√©s de Comillas with credit support for cattle, as well as state-sponsored oil exploration). Efforts to promote sustainable timber production in Marqu√©s de Comillas began in 1987 and, after a Chiapas State ban on timber extraction from 1990 to 1994, restarted in 1995. Since 1987 there has been an overall consistent policy of discouraging, if not preventing new settlement. The negotiated departure has been sought of those settled within the Biosphere Reserve post-1978 without land-rights. Government policy, as executed by a variety of state and federal authorities since the early 90s, has broadly sought to encourage a shift to sustainable agriculture so as not to make further inroads into the forest, but without great success due to weaknesses in conception and implementation - including the lack of participatory agricultural extension as proposed should be the methods used by PRODESIS. During the mid-1990s, SEMARNAP had established environmentally- orientated subsidies for maize cultivation (termed ‚Äòmilpa sedentarizada‚Äô), to prevent the burning of cut-over forest or reclaimed fallow, and to stop annual burns of weeds and crop residues. However, the quota of families to receive these subsidies in each community is usually limited and the money typically arrives very late, which greatly reduces the incentive effect. Subsidies in money and kind are also given for other crops (coffee, organic vegetables, and saplings for timber plantations), but are subject to the same limitations. Inputs have also been given for minor animal husbandry projects. Numerous small economic projects for particular communities have been implemented with a low success rate, as little participatory planning was practised, and there has been little training of community members in the management of such projects. State intervention patterns have created a situation in which government funds have become an important potential source of direct income, and this has affected local attitudes and behaviour. Communities wait and call for government schemes before taking action and can become disinclined to take local initiatives. A ‚Äòdependency syndrome‚Äô has developed that is often pronounced among the poorer communities, for which the government funds assume greater significance relative to their earnings from production. At least in some communities (Nueva Palestina) the incipient differentiation and the availability of government funds has led to tensions within the community: as to whether funds should go the better-off to further their entrepreneurial activities, or be reserved for the more disadvantaged sections of the community.  Criticism of Prodesis and European involvement in the historical context  Despite the considerable development and biodiversity justifications for setting-up Prodesis, like its predecessor-projects PIDSS and Plan Ca√±adas, was perceived by (a part of) the population and NGO's (local as well as international) as a counter-insurgency \\"light\\" project. Something that sustained this scepticism was the fact that Prodesis focussed extensively on the demographic aspects of \\"The Chiapas Problem\\", and hardly referred to the socio-political history of the area where Prodesis was implemented. By blaming the Chiapas conflict on overpopulation in a vulnerable environment, but avoiding political issues connecting to the EZLN, the San Andr√©s Accords, and the diluted Cocopa law of 2001, many felt these core issues were not being taken seriously by the EC intervention. In particular, Prodesis has found it hard to deal with: (i) the delicate issue of \\"illegal\\" settlements within the nucleus of the Reserve; (ii) the considerable tensions between ethnic groups; and (iii) the extremely polarized political allegiances that are found in the area. Ensuring participation in project design and management of the Lacandon people, other indigenous groups, and their organisations, was especially difficult. Criticism on Prodesis in relation to counter-insurgency or low intensity conflict can be broadly divided along 3 dimensions: 1] in relation to the history of marginalization of indigenous people and landless peasants in Chiapas 2] in relation to the history of social development policy in Chiapas 3] in relation to globalization, Plan Puebla Panama and the European involvement in Prodesis Many do believe that, under the guise of a development project (aimed at poverty reduction and protecting the environment), Europe's real motive to cooperate in Prodesis would be to secure European trade and investment in Mexico. Since social or political instability (or perceived instability) would pose a threat to the economic partnership, the EU would contribute to a counter-insurgency project. This would contradict Prodesis' emphasis on participative democracy. (for a similar argument see also the Zapatista memo). Hence the allegations of a new Conquista by means of neo- liberal policies and direct foreign investment. Communications from the EU itself have encouraged these ideas.

After the end of the Balkan Wars (1912‚Äì1913), the subsequent peace treaties ceded the region to Albania. This turn of events catalyzed an uprising among the local Greeks, which led to the Northern Epirote Declaration of Independence, on February 28, 1914. The International Commission of Control, an organization responsible for securing peace and stability in the region, eventually intervened and the Protocol of Corfu was signed on May 17, 1914. However the protocol‚Äôs terms were never implemented because of the politically unstable situation in Albania following the outbreak of World War I, and it was eventually annulled in 1921 during the Conference of Ambassadors. Background Georgios Christakis-Zografos, president of the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus. During the First Balkan War, the Greek Army defeated the Ottoman forces and pushed north through the region of Epirus, reaching a line from Himara on the Ionian coast east to Prespa Lake by February 1913. Pending the final adjudication of the Great Powers regarding the border between Greece and the newly established state of Albania, the region remained under Greek military control. On 17 December 1913, the Protocol of Florence ceded the northern part of this area, which became known as \\"Northern Epirus\\", to Albania. This turn of events was highly unpopular among local Greeks, who decided to declare their independence and secure the region against any opposing threat. The Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus was thus proclaimed in Argyrokastro (Gjirokast√´r) on 28 February 1914, with Georgios Christakis-Zografos, a distinguished Epirote politician from Lunxh√´ri, as its head.Stickney, 1926: p. 42 Meanwhile, the Greek army evacuated from the region, and, on 1 March, Korytsa (Kor√ß√´) was ceded to the newly formed Albanian gendarmerie. Serious disturbances broke out in a number of places between the Autonomist forces and Albanian gendarmerie units and irregulars. Meanwhile, an International Commission formed by the Great Powers to secure stability and peace in the region was unable to achieve an agreement between the two sides.Stickney, 1926, p. 167 Negotiations By early May, the Albanian authorities, being unable to suppress the revolt, became willing to start discussions with the intervention of the International Commission. Thus, Prince William of Wied of Albania asked the Commission, which represented the Albanian government, to initiate negotiations. Subsequently, on May 6, the members of the Commission informed Zografos that they were willing to discuss the demands of the Northern Epirote side. Since incorporation into Greece was not an option after the recent political developments, Zografos proposed three main solutions to the representatives of the International Commission: complete autonomy under the sovereignty of the Albanian prince, administrative and canton type autonomy, and direct administration and control by the European Powers.Heuberger, Suppan, Vyslonzil 1996, p. 68 The Northern Epirote side also demanded the extension of the area in which the Greek population would enjoy education in its native language to include the regions around Vlor√´ and Durr√´s (in central Albania, to the north of Northern Epirus), the appointment of Greek Orthodox higher officials in the main towns of Northern Epirus and the exemption from military service of the local population, even in time of war. The representatives of both sides met for negotiations in Saranda, a coastal town in Northern Epirus, but the final negotiations took place in the nearby island of Corfu, Greece.Stickney, 1926, p. 48 Finally, on May 17, 1914, the representatives of Northern Epirus and Albania signed an agreement that granted the chief demands of the Epirotes and became known as the Protocol of Corfu. The Protocol is prefaced by a signed agreement of the Commission:Memorandum on Northern Epirus, 1919, Anemi Digital Library, p. 19 Terms 200pxthumbrightThe region of Epirus, stretching across Greece and Albania.

According to its terms, the two provinces of Korytsa and Argyrokastron, which constituted Northern Epirus, would become autonomous under Albanian sovereignty and under the auspices of Prince William of Wied; he, however, was granted no effective power whatsoever. The Albanian government, in agreement with the Commission, had the right to appoint and dismiss governors and upper rank officials, taking into account the demographic composition of the local religious communities.Stickney, 1926: 49 Other terms included the proportional recruitment of natives into the local gendarmerie, and the prohibition of military levies from non-indigenous people of the region. In Orthodox schools, the Greek language would be the sole medium of instruction, except for grades one through three. However, religious education would be exclusively in Greek. Moreover, Greek was also made equal to Albanian in all public affairs, including courts and elective councils.Stickney, 1926, p. 50 As for the coastal area of Himara, the special autonomous status that it enjoyed during the Ottoman era was renewed, with the addition that a foreigner was to be appointed as its \\"captain\\" for 10 years.Miller, 1966, p. 520 Moreover, the Protocol stated that the city of Kor√ß√´ ‚Äì which was under control of the Albanian gendarmerie ‚Äì was to come under the Northern Epirote administration. The Great Powers would guarantee the implementation of the terms of the Protocol, while its execution and maintenance was entrusted to the International Control Commission. Reactions and approval On June 1 the Great Powers (including Italy and Austria-Hungary) approved the results of the negotiations and on June 23 the terms of the Protocol were officially approved by the Albanian Government.Boeckh, 1996, p. 116. The Greek government, without being involved until then in the situation, was aware of the negotiations and the possibility of a final agreement. Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos advised Georgios Christakis-Zografos to approve the protocol‚Äôs terms without asking for even wider autonomy. The Northern Epirote representatives in the following Panepirotic Assembly of Delvino had to take the final decision on whether to accept the Protocol. The Protocol was eventually accepted after the intervention of Venizelos; however the representatives of Himara found the terms too humiliating, arguing that the only viable solution would be union with Greece and not autonomy inside the Albanian state.Sakellariou, 1997, p. 381 Aftermath Political situation and outbreak of World War I Greek Prime Minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, urged the delegates of the Assembly of Delvino to accept the terms of the Protocol. Soon after the outbreak of World War I (July 1914), the situation in Albania became unstable and political chaos ensued. When the country became split into a number of regional governments, Prince William departed the country in September 1914. On 27 October, after approval from the Great Powers, the Greek army re-entered Northern Epirus. \\"Greek troops crossed the southern Albanian border at the end of October 1914, officially reoccupying all of southern Albania, exclusive of Vlora, and establishing a military administration by 27 October 1914.\\" The Provisional Government of Northern Epirus formally ceased to exist, declaring that it had accomplished its objectives.Miller, 1966, p. 522 The region was de facto annexed to Greece until the second half of 1916, when Italian troops evicted the Greek army from the area.Stickney, 1926, pp. 57‚Äì64Miller, 1966, p. 537 Interwar Period and Annulment of the Protocol In 1921 the Protocol of Corfu was annulled during the Conference of Ambassadors and Northern Epirus was definitively ceded to the Albanian state. However attempts to re-establish an autonomous Northern Epirus continued. In 1921 the Albanian government, during the country's entrance to the League of Nations, committed itself to protect the rights of minorities within its territory, which were ratified by the local Parliament next year. However, these rights were granted within a much more limited area compared to the Protocol, which included only some villages in the regions of Himara, Gjirokast√´r and Sarande, and none of the main towns.Gregoric, 2009, p. 34 Moreover, Greek education was viewed as a potential threat to the territorial integrity of the Albanian state and Greek schools were either closed or converted to Albanian ones.M. V. Sakellariou. p. 388 As a result of this policy, education in Greek was limited and for a time virtually eliminated (1934‚Äì1935).Basil Kondis & Eleftheria Manda. The Greek Minority in Albania - A documentary record (1921-1993). Thessaloniki. Institute of Balkan Studies. 1994, p. 20. Only after the intervention of the Permanent Court of International Justice, in April 1935, did the Albanian side allow the reopening of Greek-language schools and waive its insistence on the use of Albanian in Greek schools.Forster Edward Seymour. A short history of modern greece. Taylor & Francis, 1960, p. 186 The Albanian state led also efforts to establish an independent orthodox church, contrary to the provisions of the Protocol of Corfu and thereby reducing the influence of Greek language in the region. According to a 1923 law, priests who were not Albanian speakers, as well as not of Albanian origin, were excluded from this new autocephalous church. Legacy The Protocol of Corfu is often mentioned by Northern Epirote and human rights organizations when referring to the discrimination against the Greek minority in Albania.Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization. Conference Report Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization International. Conference held in The Hague, The Netherlands January 22‚Äì23, 1993, p. 24 On the other hand, in Albanian historiography this agreement is scarcely mentioned or its interpretation is often grounded on different positions:Gregoriƒç, 2008: 144 it is seen as an attempt to divide the Albanian state and as a proof of the Great Powers' disregard for the national integrity of Albania.Vickers, Pettifer, 1997: p. 2 Notably, during the 1960s, the Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev asked the communist leader of Albania Enver Hoxha about giving autonomy to the minority, but this initiative was without any result.Vickers, Pettifer, 1997: p. 188-189 The autonomy question remains one of the main issues on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian-Greek relations, after the collapse of the communist regime in Albania (1991). Moreover, a certain degree of autonomy, based on the terms of the Protocol of Corfu, is the main objective of the organization Omonoia, as well as the Unity for Human Rights Party, which represents the Greek minority in the Albanian government.Heuberger, Suppan, Vyslonzil 1996, p. 73 Such proposals were rejected in 1991 by the Albanian government, thus spurring Omonoia's radical wing to call for Union with Greece.Lastaria-Cornhiel Sussana, Wheeler Rachel. Working Paper. Albanian Series. Gender Ethnicity and Landed Property in Albania, September 1998, Land Tenure Center. University of Wisconsin. In another incident, in 1993, Omonoia‚Äôs chairman was immediately arrested by the Albanian police, after explaining in public that the goal of the Greek minority was autonomy inside the Albanian borders, based on the terms of the Protocol.

Blue line: drag force; red line: inertia force; black line: total force according to the Morison equation. Note that the inertia force is in front of the phase of the drag force: the flow velocity is a sine wave, while the local acceleration is a cosine wave as a function of time. In fluid dynamics the Morison equation is a semi-empirical equation for the inline force on a body in oscillatory flow. It is sometimes called the MOJS equation after all four authors‚ÄîMorison, O'Brien, Johnson and Schaaf‚Äîof the 1950 paper in which the equation was introduced. The Morison equation is used to estimate the wave loads in the design of oil platforms and other offshore structures. Description steel jacket structure of a Production Utilities Quarters Compression (PUQC) platform in the Rong Doi oil field, offshore Vietnam (see Oil megaprojects (2010)). The Morison equation is the sum of two force components: an inertia force in phase with the local flow acceleration and a drag force proportional to the (signed) square of the instantaneous flow velocity. The inertia force is of the functional form as found in potential flow theory, while the drag force has the form as found for a body placed in a steady flow. In the heuristic approach of Morison, O'Brien, Johnson and Schaaf these two force components, inertia and drag, are simply added to describe the inline force in an oscillatory flow. The transverse force‚Äîperpendicular to the flow direction, due to vortex shedding‚Äîhas to be addressed separately. The Morison equation contains two empirical hydrodynamic coefficients‚Äîan inertia coefficient and a drag coefficient‚Äîwhich are determined from experimental data. As shown by dimensional analysis and in experiments by Sarpkaya, these coefficients depend in general on the Keulegan‚ÄìCarpenter number, Reynolds number and surface roughness. The descriptions given below of the Morison equation are for uni-directional onflow conditions as well as body motion. Fixed body in an oscillatory flow In an oscillatory flow with flow velocity u(t), the Morison equation gives the inline force parallel to the flow direction:Sumer & Freds√∏e (2006), p. 131. :F\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\underbrace{\\\\rho\\\\, C_m\\\\, V\\\\, \\\\dot{u}}_{F_I} + \\\\underbrace{\\\\frac12\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, C_d\\\\, A\\\\, u\\\\, u}_{F_D}, where * F(t) is the total inline force on the object, * \\\\dot{u} \\\\equiv \\\\text{d}u/\\\\text{d}t is the flow acceleration, i.e. the time derivative of the flow velocity u(t), * the inertia force F_I\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, C_m\\\\, V\\\\, \\\\dot{u}, is the sum of the Froude‚ÄìKrylov force \\\\rho\\\\, V\\\\, \\\\dot{u} and the hydrodynamic mass force \\\\rho\\\\, C_a\\\\, V\\\\, \\\\dot{u}, * the drag force F_D\\\\, =\\\\, {\\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac12}\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, C_d\\\\, A\\\\, u\\\\, u according to the drag equation, * C_m=1+C_a is the inertia coefficient, and C_a the added mass coefficient, * A is a reference area, e.g. the cross-sectional area of the body perpendicular to the flow direction, * V is volume of the body. For instance for a circular cylinder of diameter D in oscillatory flow, the reference area per unit cylinder length is A=D and the cylinder volume per unit cylinder length is V={\\\\scriptstyle\\\\frac{1}{4}}\\\\pi{D^2}. As a result, F(t) is the total force per unit cylinder length: :F\\\\, =\\\\, C_m\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} D^2\\\\, \\\\dot{u}\\\\, +\\\\, C_d\\\\, \\\\frac12\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, D\\\\, u\\\\, u. Besides the inline force, there are also oscillatory lift forces perpendicular to the flow direction, due to vortex shedding. These are not covered by the Morison equation, which is only for the inline forces. Moving body in an oscillatory flow In case the body moves as well, with velocity v(t), the Morison equation becomes: : F = \\\\underbrace{\\\\rho\\\\, V \\\\dot{u}}_{a} \\\\+ \\\\underbrace{\\\\rho\\\\, C_a V \\\\left( \\\\dot{u} - \\\\dot{v} \\\\right)}_{b} \\\\+ \\\\underbrace{\\\\frac12 \\\\rho\\\\, C_d A \\\\left( u - v \\\\right) \\\\left u - v \\\\right}_{c}. where the total force contributions are: * a: Froude‚ÄìKrylov force, * b: hydrodynamic mass force, * c: drag force. Note that the added mass coefficient C_a is related to the inertia coefficient C_m as C_m=1+C_a. Limitations *The Morison equation is a heuristic formulation of the force fluctuations in an oscillatory flow. The first assumption is that the flow acceleration is more-or-less uniform at the location of the body. For instance, for a vertical cylinder in surface gravity waves this requires that the diameter of the cylinder is much smaller than the wavelength. If the diameter of the body is not small compared to the wavelength, diffraction effects have to be taken into account. *Second, it is assumed that the asymptotic forms: the inertia and drag force contributions, valid for very small and very large Keulegan‚ÄìCarpenter numbers respectively, can just be added to describe the force fluctuations at intermediate Keulegan‚ÄìCarpenter numbers. However, from experiments it is found that in this intermediate regime‚Äîwhere both drag and inertia are giving significant contributions‚Äîthe Morison equation is not capable of describing the force history very well.

It was built c. 1922 by the Colonial Oil Company to be a flagship station in their chain of filling stations. The concrete and stucco building was designed by the Boston firm of Coolidge & Carlson. It has two main sections: an octagonal section that once served as a drive-through filling area, and a rectangular service area to its left. Corinthian columns originally supported the octagonal section; these have since been covered over or replaced. The octagonal section is topped by a round dome, at whose apex is a small pillared section that was once topped by a grillwork globe that housed a light. This light, when illuminated, became the beacon which gives the station its name. The service area and pumping bay have a band of starburst panels that run along the top of the flat roofed service area and around the base of the pumping area dome. The building served as a filling station until after World War II. Since then it has served a variety of retail services, for example as a flower and produce shop in 1984. None of these uses have significantly affected the integrity of the building. The pumping bay has been enclosed in glass, making it into an integral part of the interior space. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, at which time it was one of four surviving Colonial Oil filling stations. It formerly housed an ice cream parlor before being demolished.

The book is influential within the field of international relations theory for establishing the three 'images of analysis' used to explain conflict in the international system. Waltz's three images of international relations Waltz's initial contribution to the field of international relations was his 1959 book, Man, the State, and War, which classified theories of the causes of war into three categories, or levels of analysis. Waltz refers to these levels of analysis as \\"images,\\" and uses the writings of one or more classic political philosophers to outline the major points of each image. Each image is given two chapters: the first uses mainly the classical philosopher's writings to describe what that image says about the cause of war, and the second usually has Waltz analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of that image. First image: Individuals The first image argues that wars are often caused by the nature of particular statesmen and political leaders such as state leaders, like Napoleon or Saddam Hussein, or by human nature more generally. That is basically consistent with Classical Realism, which then dominated international relations but would be discussed by Waltz more fully in his next book, Theory of International Politics. Second image: States Theories of war that fall under the rubric of Waltz's second image contend that wars are caused by the domestic makeup of states. A prime example that Waltz refers to is Lenin's theory of imperialism, which posits that the main cause of war is rooted in the need for capitalist states to continue opening up new markets to perpetuate their economic system at home. A more familiar example in the Western world today is the notion that nondemocratic states, because of their internal composition, start wars. Third image: International system Waltz next assesses the first two images as being less influential in general than the third image, yet ultimately necessary in understanding the causes of War. Waltz concludes his 1959 book Man, the State, and War with a final explanation of the three images. The third image describing the framework of world politics and the first and second images, determining the forces that create the policies of a state. The third image posits that the cause of war is found at the systemic level; namely, that the anarchic structure of the international system is the root cause of war. In this context, \\"anarchy\\" is defined not as a condition of chaos or disorder but as one in which there is no sovereign body that governs the interactions between autonomous nation-states. In other words, unlike in domestic society in which citizens can theoretically rely on law enforcement agencies to protect their persons and property, if a state is invaded and calls \\"911,\\" it cannot be sure anyone will answer. Similarly, when two citizens have a dispute, they can appeal to the courts to render a verdict and, more importantly, the law enforcement agencies to enforce the court's ruling, but there is no body above nation-states that is capable of establishing rules or laws for all the states, deciding how these apply in specific cases, and compelling the states to honor the court's ruling. As a result, if an issue at stake is important enough to a state, it can achieve a satisfactory outcome only by using its power to impose its will on another state(s). The realization that at any point in time any state can resort to armed force, forces each state always be prepared for that contingency. These themes are fleshed out more fully in Theory of International Politics which, as the title suggests, lays out a theory for international politics as a whole rather than the narrower focus on what causes war.

He was right-handed batsman who fielded as a wicket-keeper. He was born at Portsmouth, Hampshire. Debuting for Hampshire County Cricket Club in 1932, McCorkell played first-class cricket for Hampshire in two periods, from 1932 to 1939, then after World War II from 1946 to 1951. Statistically he ended his first-class career as Hampshire's most successful wicket-keeper in first-class cricket, with 677 dismissals, although Bobby Parks later overtook that total. Following his retirement he emigrated to South Africa, where he still resided until his death. In 2012, he became the 16th first-class cricketer to reach 100 years of age. Early life and career McCorkell was born in Old Portsmouth. White Hart Road, where he was born, runs roughly along the centre of the picture. McCorkell was born on 23 March 1912, at White Hart Lane (today White Hart Road) in Old Portsmouth and was educated at the Portsmouth Town School in the 1920s and early 1930s. He learned his early cricket playing for various church teams based in the city, and in a letter written to Hampshire cricket historian Dave Allen in the early 2000s, McCorkell explained how he had \\"progressed to play for Portsmouth District against Hampshire Club & Ground and was then invited to join the staff as a junior professional at the age of 19 on 1 April 1931.\\" In the decade preceding McCorkell joining Hampshire, Walter Livsey and George Brown kept wicket for the county Livsey's playing career ended in 1929, with Brown's career coming to an end by the early 1930s. McCorkell made his first-class debut for Hampshire in the 1932 County Championship against Somerset at Taunton. He established himself as a regular member of the Hampshire starting XI during that season, making 28 first-class appearances. While McCorkell did not stand out with the bat, scoring 499 runs at an average of 13.86, it was behind the stumps that he showed his talent, so much so that he did well enough to be selected for the end of season Gentlemen v Players fixture, with McCorkell representing the Players. In his debut season he claimed 38 catches and made 33 stumpings. He gained his Hampshire cap at the end of this season. McCorkell made his debut for Hampshire against Somerset at Taunton (pictured) in 1932. Having cemented his place as Hampshire's first choice wicket-keeper, McCorkell made 33 first-class appearances during the 1933 season, scoring 739 runs at an average of 18.94, with a high score of 57, one of two fifties he made in that season. He was again reliable behind the stumps too, taking 46 catches and making 10 stumpings. He featured in 29 first-class matches in the 1934 season, though failed to improve on his previous seasons batting, scoring 490 runs at an average of 14.00, with a high score of exactly fifty, while behind the stumps he was steadily reliable, taking 50 catches and making 14 stumpings. In 1935, he featured in 29 first-class matches, which included 59 batting innings. It was during this season that he established himself with the bat, passing a thousand runs during the season with a tally of 1,319 at an average of 24.42. He recorded his first century midway through this season against Lancashire with a score of 150 at the County Ground, Southampton. He recorded two further centuries in that season, in addition to making four half centuries. He took 40 catches and made 19 stumpings, further establishing himself as Hampshire's first choice wicket-keeper, with both his keeping and batting skills. The following season he once again passed 1,000 runs, scoring 1,350 at an average of exactly 27 in 32 first-class matches. He made just a single century in this season, with a score of 114 against Glamorgan at Dean Park, Bournemouth. Again solid behind the stumps, McCorkell claimed 51 catches and 15 stumpings. He also appeared for a second and final time for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's in 1936. Maharaja of Patiala (pictured). McCorkell played in 30 first-class matches for Hampshire in the 1937 season, having his most productive since his debut in 1932, passing a thousand runs with 1,506 runs at an average of 27.88. He scored two centuries and ten half centuries in this season, as well as taking 50 catches and 18 stumpings. His performances in this season earnt him a call up to teammate Lionel Tennyson's touring team to India in the winter of 1937. He played ten first-class matches on the tour against a selection of personal XIs of Maharajas, provincial/regional teams and one match against India itself. The tour was uneventful for McCorkell, with him scoring 241 runs and recording just a single half century, while taking 16 catches and making 5 stumpings. This was to be his only overseas tour. McCorkell made 33 first-class appearances in 1938, once again passing a thousand runs for the season for the fourth season in a row. His batting statistics were similar to those of the 1937 English season, with 1,586 runs at an average of 27.82, with a single century score of 136 and seven half centuries. He also took 44 catches and made 12 stumpings. In 1939, the final season before first-class cricket was cancelled due to World War II, he made 27 first-class appearances, and once again passed a thousands runs for the season, making 1,030. Despite passing this landmark for the fifth straight season, his batting was not quite as successful as it had been in previous seasons, averaging 22.39. He recorded a single century and four half centuries during this season, as well as taking 30 catches and making 11 stumpings. Including the 1939 season and the preceding four seasons before it, McCorkell had scored 6,791 runs at an average 26. A reliable glovesman, he also made 502 dismissals from behind the stumps (catches and stumpings combined) during this period. Despite his consistent performances for Hampshire he was unable to force his way into the England Test squad during this decade, due in large part to the presence of Kent wicket-keeper Les Ames, who was considered a superior batsman. World War II and later career During World War II, McCorkell was a firefighter at Vickers factory in Newbury, Berkshire. Following the end of the war in 1945, McCorkell resumed his career in county cricket with Hampshire when first-class cricket resumed in 1946 after a six season break. Resuming his wicket-keeping duties, McCorkell appeared in 24 first-class matches in that season, scoring 641 runs at an average of 15.26. This was his worst with the bat since 1934, one in which he made no centuries and recorded just a single half century. This record vastly improved in the 28 first-class appearances he made in the following season, scoring 1,665 runs at an average of 40.60, with a high score of 103 not out, one of two centuries he made that season, in addition to fifteen half centuries he also made. This season was to be the most successful of his career. In the 1948 season, McCorkell broke his finger and only played 14 matches in total, scoring 754 runs. The following year Neil scored 1,871 runs the highest season aggregate of his career. McCorkell retired from first- class cricket in 1951 and subsequently emigrated to South Africa with his family, wife Ethel and two sons Dennis and Ray. He took a position as cricket coach at Parktown Boys' High School in Johannesburg, where he worked for thirty years. The McCorkell Oval is named after him. He was up to the time of his death Hampshire's oldest surviving player. On 23 March 2012, McCorkell celebrated his 100th birthday at his Uvongo home, becoming the second Hampshire cricketer after Edward English to reach the landmark, and the thirteenth county cricketer to do so. McCorkell died on 28 February 2013, three weeks before his 101st birthday. Statistics McCorkell went on to play 396 first-class matches, scoring 16,106 runs at an average of 25.60, including 17 centuries. He scored a thousand runs in a season on nine occasions, and scored 203 against Gloucester in 1951, his last season.

He composed prolifically in many genres and founded the National Symphony Orchestra of Colombia (previously the orchestra of the National Conservatory). Biography Guillermo Uribe Holgu√≠n Uribe Holgu√≠n was born in Bogot√°. His father was Guillermo Uribe and his mother Merc√©des Holgu√≠n. While studying at the School of Engineering, he simultaneously studied violin with Ricardo Figueroa, and composition with Santos Cifuentes and Augusto Azzali, at the National Academy of Music. He became dissatisfied with his progress, and sought out a private teacher, Narciso Garay. He completed his engineering studies. In 1903 he visited New York City and for the first time he heard professional orchestras and opera. It was there that he started his series of 300 trozos, based on folk melodies, written for various instruments. In 1905 he was appointed professor of violin and harmony at the Academia. There, in December 1905, he conducted his Victimae Paschali for solo voice, chorus and orchestra. He obtained a scholarship from the Colombian government to study in Paris. In 1907, at the Schola Cantorum, he commenced violin studies with Armand Parent, and composition with Vincent d'Indy, alongside fellow students Erik Satie and Joaqu√≠n Turina. He later took violin lessons in Brussels with C√©sar Thomson and √âmile Chaumont. In 1909, his Violin Sonata No. 1 was played at a concert of the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Musique in Paris, by Gabriel Vuillaume and Ricardo Vi√±es. As a result of his Parisian studies, there is a marked French influence in the works he wrote prior to 1930. The Adventures of a Cello In Paris, he met the pianist Luc√≠a Guti√©rrez. They married in 1910, and she was often soloist in his works. She died in 1925. In 1910 he returned to Colombia and became Director of the newly reorganized National Conservatory of Music in Bogot√°. In 1932 the French government appointed him a Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur. He resigned from the Conservatory in 1935 in order to dedicate himself to composition. In 1939 he was decorated with the \\"Medalla C√≠vica del General Santander\\". In 1941 he produced an autobiography. He was reappointed director in 1942, a position he held until 1947. His final composition was Doce canciones, Op. 120, written in 1962. He died in Bogot√° in 1971. Since 2005 there has been a revival of his music by Colombian guitarist Nilko Andreas Guarin, who has been editing and promoting Uribe's works worldwide. Guarin performed the premiere in New York of Pequena Suite, Op. 80, No. 1, written for Andr√©s Segovia but never played by him. He is working on a recording of never-performed music by Uribe-Holgu√≠n including: Violin Sonata, Piano Trio, one string quartet, songs, and guitar music.WRRI: The Commune Uribe Holgu√≠n's pupils included Josefina Acosta de Bar√≥n.

Three dormers with hip roofs and small central gables are arranged across, the central one with a three-part window and the outer ones with paired sash windows. The facade is divided into three portions demarcated by sandstone quoins at the corners and similar piers between. Windows on the second and third floors are separated by Stick style panels. The Dow Block was built in 1864 by Moses Dow, a real estate investor from Charlestown. Early uses of the building included housing the town post office and library. Along with the Oddfellows Building (c. 1870) and Chase Block (1874), the building is one of the defining elements of Stoneham's Central Square.

Three described species in addition to C. symbosium are Nitrosopumilus maritimus, Nitrososphaera viennensis, and Nitrososphaera gargensis. The phylum was proposed in 2008 based on phylogenetic data, such as the sequences of these organisms' ribosomal RNA genes, and the presence of a form of type I topoisomerase that was previously thought to be unique to the eukaryotes. This assignment was confirmed by further analysis published in 2010 that examined the genomes of the ammonia-oxidizing archaea Nitrosopumilus maritimus and Nitrososphaera gargensis, concluding that these species form a distinct lineage that includes Cenarchaeum symbiosum. The lipid crenarchaeol has been found only in Thaumarchaea, making it a potential biomarker for the phylum. Most organisms of this lineage thus far identified are chemolithoautotrophic ammonia-oxidizers and may play important roles in biogeochemical cycles, such as the nitrogen cycle and the carbon cycle. Metagenomic sequencing indicates that they constitute ~1% of the sea surface metagenome across many sites. Thaumarchaeota-derived GDGT lipids from marine sediments can be used to reconstruct past temperatures via the TEX86 paleotemperature proxy, as these lipids vary in structure according to temperature. Because most Thaumarchaea seem to be autotrophs that fix CO2, their GDGTs can act as a record for past Carbon-13 ratios in the dissolved inorganic carbon pool, and thus have the potential to be used for reconstructions of the carbon cycle in the past. Metabolism Thaumarchaea are important ammonia oxidizers in aquatic and terrestrial environments, and are the first archaea identified as being involved in nitrification. They are capable of oxidizing ammonia at much lower substrate concentrations than ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, and so probably dominate in oligotrophic conditions. Their ammonia oxidation pathway requires less oxygen than that of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, so they do better in environments with low oxygen concentrations like sediments and hot springs. Ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaea can be identified metagenomically by the presence of archaeal ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) genes, which indicate that they are overall more dominant than ammonia oxidizing bacteria. In addition to ammonia, at least one Thaumarchaeal strain has been shown to be able to use urea as a substrate for nitrification. This would allow for competition with phytoplankton that also grow on urea. One study of microbes from wastewater treatment plants found that not all Thaumarchaea that express amoA genes are active ammonia oxidizers. These Thaumarchaea may be capable of oxidizing methane instead of ammonia, or they may be heterotrophic, indicating a potential for a diversity of metabolic lifestyles within the phylum. Marine Thaumarchaea have also been shown to produce nitrous oxide, which as a greenhouse gas has implications for climate change. Isotopic analysis indicates that most nitrous oxide flux to the atmosphere from the ocean, which provides around 30% of the natural flux, may be due to the metabolic activities of archaea. Many members of the phylum assimilate carbon by fixing HCO3‚àí. This is done using a hydroxypropionate/hydroxybutyrate cycle similar to the Crenarchaea but which appears to have evolved independently. All Thaumarchaea that have been identified by metagenomics thus far encode this pathway. Notably, the Thaumarchaeal CO2-fixation pathway is more efficient than any known aerobic autotrophic pathway. This efficiency helps explain their ability to thrive in low-nutrient environments. Some Thaumarchaea such as Nitrosopumilus maritimus are able to incorporate organic carbon as well as inorganic, indicating a capacity for mixotrophy. At least two isolated strains have been identified as obligate mixotrophs, meaning they require a source of organic carbon in order to grow. A study has revealed that Thaumarchaeota are most likely the dominant producers of the critical vitamin B12. This finding has important implications for eukaryotic phytoplankton, many of which are auxotrophic and must acquire vitamin B12 from the environment; thus the Thaumarchaea could play a role in algal blooms and by extension global levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Because of the importance of vitamin B12 in biological processes such as the citric acid cycle and DNA synthesis, production of it by the Thaumarchaea may be important for a large number of aquatic organisms. Environment Many Thaumarchaea, such as Nitrosopumilus maritimus, are marine and live in the open ocean. Most of these planktonic Thaumarchaea, which compose the Marine Group I.1a Thaumarchaeota, are distributed in the subphotic zone, between 100m and 350m. Other marine Thaumarchaea live in shallower waters. One study has identified two novel Thaumarchaeota species living in the sulfidic environment of a tropical mangrove swamp. Of these two species, Candidatus Giganthauma insulaporcus and Candidatus Giganthauma karukerense, the latter is associated with Gammaproteobacteria with which it may have a symbiotic relationship, though the nature of this relationship is unknown. The two species are very large, forming filaments larger than ever before observed in archaea. As with many Thaumarchaea, they are mesophilic. Genetic analysis and the observation that the most basal identified Thaumarchaeal genomes are from hot environments suggests that the ancestor of Thaumarchaeota was thermophilic, and mesophily evolved later.

Its home arena is Frogner Stadion. The club has departments for speed skating and figure skating. Establishment Piperviksbugten. Christiania Sk√∏iteklub - later Kristiania Sk√∏iteklub (KSK) - was founded 18 February 1864. The formation of the club was a spin-off from a skating competition on fjord ice in the Oslo Fjord 1 March 1863. The skating sport was quite popular at the time, and the club had about 1000 members after two years, and more than 5000 members in 1870, when Christiania had less than 70000 inhabitants. In 1924 the club changed its name to Oslo Sk√∏iteklub. Arena The first skating activities were done on sea ice, outside Vippetangen or in Frognerkilen. Also Tullinl√∏kken and the Majorstuen stadium were used for skating competitions and performances. In 1901 the club's new stadium opened at Frogner, and this soon became the most important skating arena in Oslo and Norway. Because of the 1914 Jubilee Exhibition in Kristiania, another stadium was built north of the first one. At this stadium a long series of international championships were organized, in both speed skating and figure skating. Prominent skaters Oscar Mathisen was a member of Kristiania Sk√∏iteklub. The first stars of the club were Axel Paulsen, inventor of the Axel jump in 1882, who competed in both figure skating and speed skating, and speed skater Rudolf Gundersen. From 1907 and onwards Oscar Mathisen was KSK's big star. In the 1920s Bernt Evensen won several championship titles and Olympic medals for OSK. The club also fostered the figure skater Sonja Henie, who won three successive Olympic Championships, and ten World Championships. During the 1930s Oslo Sk√∏iteklub played an important role in organizing speed skating for women. Several women who dominated the sport in the 1930s were members of OSK: Synn√∏ve Lie, Undis Blikken and Laila Schou Nilsen. After the Second World War skaters as Roald Aas and Svein-Erik Stiansen won titles for the club.
