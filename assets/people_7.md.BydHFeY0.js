Kabitsin fought in the Russian Civil War on the Eastern Front. He commanded a machine-gun platoon. By Operation Barbarossa, Kabitsin was a political officer of a rifle battalion in Kirov. He became a battalion commissar in a battalion of the 135th Rifle Division when that division was formed in fall 1941. He fought in the Battles of Rzhev and was sent to the Frunze Military Academy for a course for rifle regiment commanders. In September 1943, he became deputy commander of a rifle regiment in the 47th Guards Rifle Division. Kabitsin fought in the Donbass Strategic Offensive (August 1943), the Battle of the Dnieper, Nikopol‚ÄìKrivoi Rog Offensive, Dnieper‚ÄìCarpathian Offensive, and Operation Bagration. During the fall of 1944, he fought in the defense of the Magnuszew bridgehead and the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive from January 1945. For his actions in the Battle of Berlin, Kabitsin was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. After the war, Kabitsin continued to serve in the Soviet Army and retired as a colonel in 1953.  Early life and Russian Civil War  Kabitsin was born in the village of Vyrytovo in the Kasimovsky Uyezd of Vladimir Governorate to a peasant family. After graduation from primary school, he worked as a carpenter. He was drafted into the Red Army in 1920. Kabitsin was sent to the Eastern Front and fought against the White Army near Irkutsk and the Transbaikal during 1920. He was a machine-gunner and then commander of a machine-gun platoon.  Interwar  Between 1922 and 1929 Kabitsin was commander of a machine-gun platoon in Udmurtia. In 1925, he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He graduated from political courses in Leningrad in 1929. Kabitsin was sent to the Ural Military District and served in the commissar's office in Glazov. In 1936 he completed the Vystrel courses. After the courses, Kabitsin became the political officer of a rifle battalion in Kirov.  World War II  In the fall of 1941, the 135th Rifle Division was formed in the Kirov Oblast. Kabitsin was appointed commissar of the 3rd Rifle Battalion of the 495th Rifle Regiment. The division was transported to Kolomna and in February 1942 became part of the 4th Shock Army. It then fought in the Toropets‚ÄìKholm Offensive and advanced to Velizh and Demidov. A large gap formed on the left wing of the army where it joined the neighboring 22nd Army and the 135th was sent into the gap at the end of February. For the next three months Kabitsin's battalion fought in counterattacks around the villages of Bor, Glintsevo, Vyshegory, Gudilovo and Zaleksonovka in the Belsky District. Heavy fighting occurred at the end of March and in April, resulting in severe losses being inflicted on the division in the area of Bor and the Losmyanka River. The battalion was unable to reach Demekhi and cut the Belyi- Dukhovshchina highway in fighting against the 246th Volksgrenadier Division. In June 1942, the division was moved to defend the Kholm-Zhirkovsky ridge northwest of Bely. At the beginning of July German troops began Operation Seydlitz. Under heavy pressure from German troops Kabitsin's battalion retreated to Pushkar and then to Yegorye. On 5 July the German troops met at Pushkar and Kabitsin's battalion was trapped in the encirclement. On 9 July Kabitsin was slightly wounded, but was able to break out at Nesterovo and then moved to Maximova Gora. In the fall of 1942, the newly reinforced 135th Division, as part of 39th Army, fought in Operation Mars. In this battle Kabitsin was officially still commissar but served as battalion commander almost from the first day. On 25 November his battalion helped break through German defenses at Molodoy Tud, and in the following days the battalion fought in the battle for the village of Urdom, north of Olenino. The German 14th Motorized Division reinforced the sector, slowing the advance. In early December, the 135th Division moved closer to Rzhev, and Kabitsin's battalion fought to capture Trushkovo and Gonchuki. The German Kampfgruppe Becker reinforced German defenses in the sector, cutting off the 28th Tank Brigade from the infantry. Kabitsin's battalion fought in the relief of the tank brigade but could not advance. In the fighting his battalion suffered casualties of about 130 killed. In early 1943 Kabitsin was promoted to Major and sent to study at the Frunze Military Academy. He finished a course for regimental commanders in early September. Kabitsin became deputy commander of the 140th Guards Rifle Regiment of the 47th Guards Rifle Division. The division was part of the 8th Guards Army, which advanced in the second tier of the front. It fought in the Donbass Strategic Offensive (August 1943) and Zaporizhia Offensive. At the end of September the division reached Zaporizhia but Kabitsin's regiment could not quickly suppress German artillery defenses. Kabitsin and the regimental commander formed assault groups and scouts identified the artillery positions. The attack began on 10 October and Kabitsin's regiment broke through the defenses from the east and began street fighting operations. By 14 October the city had been completely cleared. In January and February 1944 the division fought in the Nikopol‚ÄìKrivoi Rog Offensive. On 31 January his regiment broke through German defenses in the Tomakivskyi Raion and on 4 February helped capture Apostolove. For its actions during the offensive the division was awarded the honorific \\"Lower Dnieper\\". The division then fought in the Bereznegovatoye-Snigirevka Offensive in March. On 8 March the division captured Bashtanka and then participated in the Odessa Offensive. On 10 April, Kabitsin's regiment fought in the capture of the city and then moved into the Dniester estuary, after which the 8th Guards Army was sent into reserve and transferred to the 1st Belorussian Front. The army was redeployed to the Kovel area for the next two months. There, Kabitsin became a lieutenant colonel and took command of the regiment. On 17 May his jeep was ambushed by partisans of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. Kabitsin's driver was killed and Kabitsin was slightly wounded but Kabitsin, a signalman and one of his battalion commanders were rescued by motorized infantry. On 18 July, the Lublin‚ÄìBrest Offensive began. The regiment broke through German defenses in the area of the villages of Ruda and Pelyukh and by 19 July had cleared Liuboml with the division. On 20 July advanced units of the regiment crossed the Western Bug south of Opalin. On 23 July battalions of the regiment helped capture Lublin. On 1 August the division reached the Vistula and began fighting for Grzyb√≥w, Kozienice County. On the next day the division crossed the Vistula into the Magnuszew bridgehead.From August to early September the division fought to defend the bridgehead. From 5 August Kabitsin's regiment defended in the area of Michalow, facing repeated counterattacks from the 19th Panzer Division. On 9 August the regiment captured Grabnovolya and on 15 August Brontin and Malenchin. The regiment later fought in the area of Emilyuv, Michalow and Gmina G≈Çowacz√≥w. From 14 January 1945 the 140th Guards Rifle Regiment fought in the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive and on 19 January helped capture ≈Å√≥d≈∫. It helped storm Pozna≈Ñ on 23 January and on 29 January crossed the Oder south of Kustrin. For his leadership Kabitsin was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 31 January.Order No. 465, 8th Guards Army, available online at pamyat-naroda.ru During February and March the regiment fought to hold the bridgehead.

The Berlin Offensive was launched on 16 April. The regiment was unable to capture the Seelow Heights. On the night of 18 April, the 140th attacked with Kabitsin reportedly leading and after four hours broke through the defense. The regiment repulsed twelve counterattacks during the following day and at the end of the day launched a tank-supported counterattack, dislodging German troops from two lines of trenches. In this battle, Kabitsin was wounded but reportedly continued to lead. In the subsequent days the 140th reached Karlshorst and on 22 April advanced into Berlin itself. Kabitsin reportedly personally crossed the Spree with the 1st Battalion, capturing nearby houses and assisting in the crossing of the division. The regiment reached the Tiergarten in the last days of April. Between 16 April and 8 May, the regiment reportedly destroyed eleven tanks and self-propelled guns, 4 half-tracks, 5 batteries and 115 heavy machine-guns.

He is a friend and neighbour of Jonathan Oldbuck, the novel‚Äôs title-character.  Wardour's role in the novel  He first appears when he and his daughter Isabella are invited to Oldbuck‚Äôs house to meet his new friend Lovel. Wardour, we are told, is a former Jacobite who has become reconciled to the House of Hanover, and is interested in antiquarian research. As they have dinner together they fall out over the question of the Pictish language, Wardour thinking it Celtic and Oldbuck Germanic. Things get so heated that the Wardours call the dinner-party short and walk homeward over the sands of the intervening bay, but the incoming tide cuts them off and threatens to drown them. They are rescued by the combined efforts of their neighbours, and Wardour is bundled off home in a state of exhaustion. When Oldbuck and Lovel next day visit Wardour they find him semi-invalid. It becomes apparent, firstly that there is a romance between Isabella and Lovel which must seemingly be frustrated since Lovel is believed to be illegitimate, and secondly that Wardour hopes to recoup his diminished fortune by prospecting for a lead mine, being encouraged in this project by a suspicious German character called Herman Dousterswivel. Wardour later invites Oldbuck and Lovel to join him in a trip to the ruins of St. Ruth's Priory, and when the day comes the conversation turns to a treasure rumoured to be buried there. One night shortly afterwards Wardour and Dousterswivel are discovered excavating in the grounds of the Priory, the baronet having been persuaded by his companion that he had discovered the site of the treasure by alchemical means, and a small bag of old coins is duly found. Wardour next tries to persuade Oldbuck to invest in a larger-scale excavation. Oldbuck turns down the chance, but persuades him to try the search without making the payments to Dousterswivel that the German insists are necessary. A quantity of silver bullion is uncovered, delighting Wardour and dumbfounding Dousterswivel. After an interval we learn that Wardour has been squandering his new-found money unwisely, while most of his debts remain unpaid. His main creditor institutes bankruptcy proceedings and sends in the bailiffs, but just as Sir Arthur is facing the prospect of a debtors' prison a letter arrives from his son enclosing enough money to pay off the main debt. Isabella's lover is discovered to be the long-lost legitimate son of a wealthy earl, and the two are speedily married, putting Sir Arthur out of all financial danger.  His character  Sir Arthur Wardour has a deep and lasting, though stormy, friendship with his neighbour Jonathan Oldbuck, which is based on their common interests; they both conduct historical research, though Sir Arthur is a dilettante compared to his friend. Their approach to the past is not that of a scientific historian, deducing hypotheses from solid evidence, but that of an antiquary, forming opinions first and justifying them with whatever evidence comes to hand afterwards. Sir Arthur‚Äôs particular interest is in the history of the Wardour family and of the kings of Scotland, this pursuit being motivated by his need to bolster his own feelings of social superiority over those around him, including the middle-class Oldbuck. He does not feel at home in the present, but he demonstrates the impossibility of living in the past by his ridiculous bluster and insufferable snobbishness. He is altogether a futile figure with many faults: he is shown as being financially extravagant, self-centred, weak, gullible, and tyrannical over his daughter Isabella, who tries to protect him from the results of his stupidity. His greed makes him an easy dupe for the swindler Dousterswivel, so that the reader may feel that his near-ruin is an appropriate fate.  The originals of Wardour  Sir Arthur was said by Scott's acquaintance Allan Cunningham to have been modelled on Sir John Whitefoord, 3rd Bt., though it has also been claimed that he was based on Sir John Sinclair, 1st Bt., a Caithness landowner who was taken in by a fraudulent geologist, Rudolf Erich Raspe. According to one commentator, ‚ÄúScott detested Sir John Sinclair, and probably got some pleasure from representing him as Sir Arthur Wardour‚Äù. Similarities have also been noted between Sir Arthur and the fictional Sir Epicure Mammon, the gullible nobleman in Ben Jonson‚Äôs play The Alchemist. Yet another claim is that Wardour is a portrait of his own author as a true-blue Tory supporter of the claims of the established aristocratic order; A. N. Wilson was also struck by the similarity Sir Arthur displays to Scott's behaviour in later years, ‚Äúduped by hare- brained financial schemes and folie de grandeur‚Äù, and, when his fortune is restored, talking of buying contiguous estates that would stretch from shore to shore.  Later appearance  Sir Arthur Wardour later appeared in the fictional Laurence Templeton's Introduction (or ‚ÄúDedicatory Epistle‚Äù) to Scott's Ivanhoe. There Templeton, the ostensible author of the novel, tells us he has based ‚Äúhis‚Äù story of Ivanhoe on a medieval manuscript owned by Sir Arthur, who guards it jealously while being unable to read a syllable of it, and who insists on Templeton referring to it in pompous Blackletter type as \\\\mathfrak{The}\\\\,\\\\mathfrak{Wardour}\\\\,\\\\mathfrak{Manuscript}. As the novel progresses Templeton several times refers back to this manuscript.  Critical assessment  There is no critical consensus as to whether Sir Arthur is a successful fictional creation. W. S. Crockett thought he was ‚Äúan eminently silly type of aristocrat ‚Äì a foolish old Tory with whom we lose all patience‚Äù. Edgar Johnson found him exaggeratedly credulous and insufficiently realized for us to care about the final clearing up of all his troubles, and complained that though we are told he has in the end learned greater wisdom we are not shown it. On the other hand, Andrew Lang found him ‚Äúperennially delightful‚Äù, and A. N. Wilson thought him one of the comic portraits that makes The Antiquary great.

It is located at no. 59/30 N√°rodn√≠ t≈ô√≠da, in the New Town of Prague (Praha 1 ‚Äì Nov√© Mƒõsto). The gallery holds exhibitions particularly of works by living Czech professional artists of the middle generation who are among the best painters, photographers, and sculptors on the art scene today. The exhibitions regularly alternate between works of painting, photography, and sculpture.  History  From 1916 to 1938, the Rube≈° Gallery operated at this address. In the late 1930s, the building was thoroughly remodelled for the Vil√≠mek publishing house and bookshop and the gallery was opened in 1941 as the Galerie Jos. R. Vil√≠mek at no. 30 Viktoriastrasse (as N√°rodn√≠ t≈ô√≠da was called during the German occupation), Prague. The bookshop, designed by the architect Franti≈°ek Zelenka, was built in 1938 on the ground floor and first floor of what had originally been an Art Nouveau building. From 1949 to 1953 (in the early years of the Communist r√©gime), the building housed the Galerie Pr√°ce (Work Gallery), then, from 1953 to 1954, it was the home of the Galerie Kniha (Book Gallery), and, until 1959, the Galerie ƒåesk√©ho fondu v√Ωtvarn√Ωch umƒõn√≠ (Gallery of the Czech Council for Fine Art). Beginning in 1959, when the gallery was named after the Czech painter, graphic artist, and illustrator V√°clav ≈†p√°la, the exhibition programme was gradually influenced by writers on art such as Eva Petrov√°, Ji≈ô√≠ ≈†etl√≠k, Ludmila Vachtov√°, and Franti≈°ek Dvo≈ô√°k. Beginning with an exhibition of works by Zbynƒõk Sekal in 1965, the gallery flourished under the management of the respected writer on art Jind≈ôich Chalupeck√Ω. Under his direction, a whole generation of Czech modern artists showed their works one after another in the gallery, but, in 1969, it also held the only Prague exhibition of works by Marcel Duchamp. The last exhibition organized by Chalupeck√Ω consisted of paintings by Vladim√≠r Kopeck√Ω in May 1970. In the 1970s and 1980s, after the defeat of the ‚ÄòPrague Spring‚Äô reform movement, Chalupeck√Ω was under a State ban and could not publish or be employed in his field. The gallery programme at this time was determined by the Association of Czechoslovak Fine Artists (Svaz ƒçeskoslovensk√Ωch v√Ωtvarn√Ωch umƒõlc≈Ø), which was subservient to the r√©gime, and the importance of the gallery declined. Since the Velvet Revolution of late 1989, the V√°clav ≈†p√°la Gallery has again been holding exhibitions curated by respected scholars of art, including Mahulena Ne≈°lehov√°, Ji≈ô√≠ Valoch, Marie Klime≈°ov√°, Eva Petrov√°, Josef Kroutvor, Jan K≈ô√≠≈æ, and Ivo Janou≈°ek, showing works of art by young new artists as well as artists of the 1960s and 1970s generations. In honour of the golden era of the V√°clav ≈†p√°la Gallery, a Jind≈ôich Chalupeck√Ω Prize (Cena Jind≈ôicha Chalupeck√©ho) for Czech fine artists aged 35 years or younger was established in 1990. The first winner was Vladim√≠r Kokolia. In the 1990s, under the direction of Jaroslav Krb≈Ø≈°ek, the V√°clav ≈†p√°la Gallery became generally known as a forward-looking exhibition space for contemporary Czech art. Beginning in 2002, the gallery was run by the Czech Art Foundation (Nadace ƒåesk√Ω fond umƒõn√≠), which began to lease the gallery to anyone who was willing to pay. This resulted in public protests from a range of people in the art world. In 2007, the Borough of Prague 1 published a request for tender to find someone or some institution that would operate the gallery. Semma, an advertising and marketing agency, won the tender, but two years later ceased to rent it, allegedly because of a lack of finances.http://magazin.aktualne.cz/kultura/umeni/najemce-spalovky-zrejme-v- breznu-skonci/r~i:article:660246 In 2010, the Borough of Prague 1 published another request for tender to find someone to operate the V√°clav ≈†p√°la Gallery. The winning project was presented by PPF Art, which thus took over the gallery for the next ten years. Together with the V√°clav ≈†p√°la Gallery, PPF Art, part of the PPF Group, also manages the Josef Sudek Studio (Ateli√©r Josef Sudek) on √öjezd street, Prague. PPF Art is also the curator of a unique collection of Czech and Slovak photography, the largest part of which is a collection of photographs by the renowned Josef Sudek. PPF Art is also the curator of a collection that constitutes a cross-section of Czech fine art from the late nineteenth century to the present.

Archbishop Jos√© Juli√°n de Aranguren was born in Barasoain, in Pamplona, Spain. He read philosophy in Pamplona and law in Zaragoza. In 1816 he entered the Order of the Augustinians Recollects at Alfaro, La Rioja. He professed the monastic vows on December 8, 1825 at the Augustinian Recollect convent of Alfaro.(Miguel, 2012) As a professor of Sacred Theology, Father Aranguren collaborated in the formation of future priests in La Rioja, Spain. Upon arriving in the Philippines in 1829, he continued imparting the spirituality of Saint Augustine at San Nicolas convent in Intramuros, Manila. In August 1831, he oversaw the parish of Capis in Tarlac. He then served as overseer of Masinloc in 1835 after a 50-year hiatus of the Recollect ministry in the province of Zambales . The strong church building he made in Masinloc was made of hewn stones and lime. He also became a secretary for the incumbent prior provincial of the Recollect Friars in Masinloc. After becoming the prior provincial of the Recollects himself in 1843, he was nominated to be Archbishop of Manila on November 13, 1845. He was preconized by Pope Pius IX on 9 January 1846 and his principal consecrator was the Bishop of Cebu, Romualdo Jimeno Ballesteros of the Dominican Order. Archbishop Jos√© Juli√°n de Aranguren started his office in 1847 after being ordained bishop on January 31, 1847. He visited almost all the parishes and mission stations of his archdiocese twice. He supported the establishment of Banco Espa√±ol ‚Äì Filipino [now Bank of the Philippine Islands] in the Philippines. He invited the Carmelite Sisters of Charity to Manila, and defended the rights and interests of the native secular clergy of his archdiocese.

It has since lost its tower. Netherton Cricket Club is a sports club situated in the Netherton area of the West Midlands region of England. Founded in 1866 at Lodge Farm, Netherton, it moved to its present position on the side of Netherton Hill in 1879. The club currently runs 3 Saturday teams, 2 Sunday teams and 2 midweek teams for adults. History Netherton Cricket Club was founded in 1866 and had its first sporting fixture in 1867. The club's ground was situated in Lodge Farm at the foot of Netherton Hill and was rented from Thomas Gower at an annual cost of ¬£15. The surnames (including Barnsley, Danks and Hotchkiss) of the team members from an 1869 report of a game against Brierley Hill reveal that many of the founder members of the Netherton club came from families prominent in local industry and business. From 1875 the club's ground became associated with the annual Netherton Rural F√™tes and Athletic Sports meeting. The club's ground moved to its present position further up Netherton Hill in 1879. The use of the land was granted to them by the Earl of Dudley on condition that the Netherton Church Committee could use the ground for three days per year to hold their money-raising f√™tes. An iron pavilion was constructed at this time. In June 1890, Joseph Darby, the locally born champion jumper appeared at the annual sports meeting. The players adopted an 'Oxford Blue' club cap in 1894. At the turn of the century around ¬£2000 was spent on ground improvements. In the early decades of the 20th century, the club sometimes fielded a professional (and for a few years two professionals) although none were employed after the 1921 season. In 1928, the Club purchased the ground from the Earl of Dudley. However, because of financial difficulties occurring during the Second World War, the ownership of the grounds were passed to Dudley Council in 1946. A new Club House was built in 1963 using an old school building. Location The club is located at Highbridge Road, Netherton in the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley. The grounds are on the south side of Netherton Hill, next to Netherton Church of England Primary School. Teams and matches  The club runs 3 Saturday teams, 2 Sunday teams and 2 midweek teams for adults as well as youth teams. The club's \\"Saturday\\" teams play in the Worcestershire County League on Saturdays and some weekdays. For the 2016 season, the First XI plays in the Division Three 1st; the Second XI plays in the Division One 2nd and the Third XI competes in the Division 7 North.

It occurs prominently among children, accounting for many hospital admissions each year. Common hydrocarbons involved are mineral spirits, mineral seal oil (common in furniture polish), lamp oil, kerosene (paraffin), turpentine (pine oil), gasoline, and lighter fluid. Pneumatocele is a complication of hydrocarbon pneumonitis. In both childhood and adult pneumonitis, hydrocarbon aspiration occurs at the time of initial ingestion event or subsequently with vomiting. Low viscosity of an ingested hydrocarbon is considered a major factor promoting aspiration (presumably for mechanical reasons). Contrary to aspiration hydrocarbon pneumonitis, hydrocarbon (solvent) vapor inhalation manifests primarily in either central nervous system or cardiac effects.  Fire-eater's lung  \\"Fire-eater's lung\\" is an important variant of hydrocarbon pneumonitis, which typically involves adolescents or young adults who are exposed through mishap during flame-blowing performances using a variety of different flammable materials. The substances used overlap with some of the pediatric exposures (kerosene, gasoline) but can also include other hydrocarbons such as jet fuel and, in France, an aromatic hydrocarbon enriched petroleum-distillate called \\"kerdan\\". There has also been a case of citronella oil aspiration in a fire-eater. As with hydrocarbon pneumonitis in children, fire-eater's lung can also be complicated by pneumatocele. Although the term \\"acute lipoid pneumonia\\" has been used to refer to the \\"fire-eater's lung\\" syndrome, this is a misnomer.  Symptoms  Oral ingestion of hydrocarbons often is associated with symptoms of mucous membrane irritation, vomiting, and central nervous system depression. Cyanosis, tachycardia, and tachypnea may appear as a result of aspiration, with subsequent development of chemical pneumonitis. Other clinical findings include albuminuria, hematuria, hepatic enzyme derangement, and cardiac arrhythmias. Doses as low as 10 ml orally have been reported to be potentially fatal, whereas some patients have survived the ingestion of 60 ml of petroleum distillates. A history of coughing or choking in association with vomiting strongly suggests aspiration and hydrocarbon pneumonia. Hydrocarbon pneumonia is an acute hemorrhagic necrotizing disease that can develop within 24 h after the ingestion. Pneumonia may require several weeks for complete resolution. Symptoms of chemical (hydrocarbon) pneumonia may include: * burning of the nose, eyes, lips, mouth, and throat * dry cough * wet cough producing clear, yellow, or green mucus * cough producing blood or frothy pink matter * nausea or abdominal pain * chest pain * shortness of breath * painful breathing or pleuritis (an inflammation of the outside covering of the lungs) * headache * flu symptoms  Treatment  General treatment principles are removal from exposure, protection of the airway (i.e., preemptive intubation), and treatment of hypoxemia. Concomitant airway injury with acute bronchospasm often warrants treatment with bronchodilators because of the airway obstruction. A beneficial role for corticosteroids has not been established by controlled trials in humans. Despite the lack of controlled evidence of efficacy, anecdotal reports of benefits from systemic corticosteroid use continue to appear. Prophylactic antibiotic drugs have not proved to be efficacious in toxic lung injury. Antibiotics should be reserved for those patients with clinical evidence of infection.

It has been recommended that it be added to the Queensland Heritage Register due to its rarity, high architectural value and contribution to the character of the street. It is the largest privately owned building on the Southport Heritage Walk, a good example of a hotel built in the 1930s and a prominent landmark of social and historical significance to the community. The current hotel is the second building on the site and is an integral part of an early twentieth century streetscape that includes the heritage listed Southport Town Hall, an earlier Ambulance Station and a number of buildings designed by the architect Thomas Ramsay Hall. After over 100 years of operation, the Hotel Cecil, also referred to as the Cecil Hotel and B.DeMille's, is the oldest public house on the Gold Coast to maintain its original name throughout all its years of operation. History (1907-1937) Tenders for the construction of the original two storey wooden building on the site were called for in July 1907 with plans available for viewing at Stephens and Tozer's offices at 240 Queen Street, Goodna, Brisbane, Queensland. The building was constructed by D.J. Coulster with R.M. Pidd working as the leading hand. From early February 1908 the hotel was advertising for staff and, by early March 1908, it was welcoming guests and advertised as being 'newly erected'. The first proprietor and host of the Hotel Cecil was Harry Taylor, formerly a blacksmith at Nerang, who arranged for the construction of the building, owned the freehold on the property and occupied the hotel as the licensee with his wife and daughter. Reservations for the hotel, which had capacity to accommodate 40 guests, could be made in advance by sending a postcard. The hotel offered a horse drawn buggy service that transported guests from the nearby Southport Railway Station on the South Coast railway line, Queensland to the hotel. In addition to guests intending to stay overnight, day trippers taking advantage of special excursion trains from the surrounding areas could spend the day at Southport and dine at the Cecil Hotel before returning home in the evening. The hotel was also the venue for significant functions including an official dinner for the Governor-General of India Edward Frederick Lindley Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax, in 1926. Other gatherings that took place included balls, school reunions, meetings of the local Chamber of Commerce and fund raising events. A number of prominent local people were associated with the Hotel Cecil including Sidney Monkhouse, Vincent, W. Austen, M.C. Gosling, W.J. Gorman and Cyril Hornibrook Culby. History (1938-1999) In June 1938 the then owners of the hotel, the Queensland Brewery Ltd, with the licensee Thomas Campbell Andrews, oversaw the relocation of the original timber structure to another location on the same site prior to construction of a new two storey brick hotel. Andrews, a Southport businessman and bachelor originally from Mudgeeraba, had taken over the licence in 1936 and held it until his sudden death in 1939 a few months after the new building was completed. The new hotel was designed by Addison and MacDonald, an architectural firm that was active between 1927 and 1947 that consisted of George Frederick Addison, the son and business partner of one of Brisbane's earliest architects George Henry Male Addison, and Herbert Stanley MacDonald formerly of Hall and Prentice. In addition to designing the Goondiwindi Civic Centre, the firm undertook work for both the Queensland Brewery Company and Castlemaine Perkins during this period, including the XXXX Brewery and the State Heritage Registered Castlemaine Perkins Building and Queensland Brewery Company Building. The architects reported that the Queensland Brewery Ltd, had given them a 'free hand' in designing the 'palatial structure' which was built by K.E. Morris of Brisbane. Construction took four months and, in October 1938, the new saloon and public bars were officially open. The new Art Deco styled hotel was reported as having 'outstanding architectural features' with a curved facade facing the corner of Scarborough and Nerang Streets with the name of the hotel in cement letters accented in red and pale green. Twenty guest rooms were located on the first floor with the bridal suite featuring a curved private balcony over looking the intersection below. The exterior of the building included brown and cream tiles with Venetian red bricks cut through with cream bands. The roofing tiles were multi-coloured Marseilles tiles. The interior decoration of the hotel was in red, green and autumnal tones and featured polished chromium strips and patterned sand blasted glass doors with seaside themed decorative elements. After World War Two, the hotel was leased for twenty years to Claude and Hedwig Anna Slack (n√©e Eschenhagen) after they ceased running a guest house in London and returned to Australia. The Eschenhagen family had a strong association with the hospitality industry in Queensland and were well respected early caterers and restaurateurs in Brisbane. Following her involvement with the Hotel Cecil, Anna Slack retired in Southport. History (2000-2016) The hotel underwent a refurbishment in 2000 to create office and retail space which is leased to a variety of tenants. In 2014, the track for the Gold Coast Light Rail was constructed along the northern street and eastern frontages of the building. The main station for Southport is located opposite the hotel in the middle of Southport's central business district.

Moore supervised and edited fourteen watershed reports conducted in New York between 1926 and 1939 and these were the most comprehensive scientific surveys of any states' water resources.  Early life  Emmeline Moore was born in Batavia, New York, in 1872 and grew up on a farm there. In 1895, she graduated from Geneseo Normal School (now SUNY Geneseo). And following the path of many women born in the 1870s she taught at the normal schools in order to earn enough to go to college. She then enrolled at Cornell University, earning a B.A in 1905, followed by an M.A. at Wellesley College in 1906. After acquiring her masters she taught biology in normal schools for four years and then accepted a position of substitute professor of botany at Huguenot College in South Africa for a year. She then returned to the United States and this was followed by further study at Cornell, where she received her Ph.D. in 1916 in biology. From 1914-1919, Moore taught biology at Vassar College, eventually rising to the level of assistant professor. She also worked at the Bureau of Fisheries during summers which piqued her interest in research work.  Biologist  Moore first worked as a research biologist in the New York Conservation Department and then as chief aquatic biologist and director of the New York State Biological Survey where she produced some of the best early state surveys of aquatic resources. She studied rivers, lake pollution and fish diseases while working with New York Conservation Department for the next twenty four years. Her research was extensive and accorded her with significant attention. She was the first woman to be elected as President of the American Fisheries Society. She also managed to publish technical papers on fish culture and fish diseases. After her retirement she continued research at Laboratory of Oceanography at Yale for a few years.  Awards  Emmeline Moore has been honored twice with the Walker Prize from the Boston Society of Natural History. She was also awarded an honorary degree from Hobart College. In her late eighties, she christened a New York oceanographic research ship named in her honor.  Death  She died at a nursing home in Guilderland, New York at the age of 91 following an extended illness.

It is located north of the city of Qui Nh∆°n in southern Vietnam. USAF use Ph√π C√°t base operations building in 1968 In late 1965, with the buildup of US airpower in South Vietnam, the existing air bases were becoming overcrowded. In September, plans to build an air base at Qui Nhon were suspended when the site conditions were found to be unsuitable. In January 1966 a site in Ph√π C√°t District 24 km north of Qui Nhon was identified. In late February 1966 Military Assistance Command, Vietnam decided to build a new jet-capable base at Ph√π C√°t. In April 1966 forces from the Republic of Korea Army Tiger Division secured the area for base construction, with the construction crews arriving in May. The Vietcong (VC) harassed construction with booby-traps and sniper fire killing 3 Korean soldiers. On 23 December 1966 USAF units began moving to the half-completed base. At this time the runway was a long dirt strip while the taxiways and parking areas were covered in Pierced steel planking (PSP). Nevertheless, the 459th and 537th Troop Carrier Squadrons both equipped with C-7As began operations from the base on 1 January 1967. Base facilities by this time included wooden barracks, a mess hall, recreation facilities and utilities. By late March 1967 a by asphalt runway together with sealed taxiways and parking aprons had been completed. Later in the year a fuel line was constructed to the base from a tank facility on the outskirts of Qui Nhon. The 37th Tactical Fighter Wing (37th TFW) began operations from the base in April 1967. The 37th TFW comprised the following F-100 equipped squadrons: * 416th Tactical Fighter Squadron (416th TFS), transferred from the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing at Bien Hoa Air Base * Detachment 1, 612th Tactical Fighter Squadron (612th TFS), transferred from the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing at Phan Rang Air Base While based at Ph√π C√°t, a detachment from the 416th pioneered fast Forward Air Control (FAC) operations using two-seat F-100Fs under the code-name Commando Sabre and the call sign Misty. In September 1967 a detachment from the 4th Air Commando Squadron equipped with 4 AC-47 Spooky gunships began operating from the base. In September 1969 the 4th Air Commando Squadron ceased operating from the base and moved its forward operating base to Da Nang Air Base. On 3 February 1968 the 355th Tactical Fighter Squadron (355th TFS) was attached to the 37th TFW. On 5 May 1968 the 174th Tactical Fighter Squadron (174th TFS) an Iowa Air National Guard unit equipped with F-100Cs deployed to Ph√π C√°t AB. Detachment 13 of the 38th Air Rescue Squadron would be established at the base, renamed Detachment 13, 3rd Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Group in July 1971, it would remain there until November 1971 when it was inactivated. On 13 April 1969, Detachment 1 612th TFS left the base and was replaced by the 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron equipped with F-4Cs which moved from Da Nang AB. On 11 May the 174th TFS returned to the US, followed by the 355th TFS on 15 May. On 27 May the 416th TFS transferred to Tuy Hoa Air Base and the Commando Sabre Fast FACs were inactivated. On 24 June the 389th Tactical Fighter Squadron equipped with F-4Ds transferred to the base from Da Nang AB. In November B Flight, 18th Special Operations Squadron (18th SOS) equipped with 3 AC-119K gunships deployed to the base where they operated primarily against supply routes in Laos.

On 1 April the 37th TFW was inactivated and redesignated as the 12th Tactical Fighter Wing (12th TFW). In June the 459th Troop Carrier Squadron was inactivated. The 537th Troop Carrier Squadron would also be inactivated during the year with its aircraft transferred to the RVNAF. On 29 December A Flight 17th SOS was inactivated and its aircraft transferred to B Flight at Phan Rang AB. On 31 August 1971 the 361st Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron equipped with EC-47N/Ps departed from the base. On 8 October the 389th TFS flew its last combat mission and on 26 October its aircraft began returning to the US. On 20 October the 480th TFS flew its and the 12th TFW's last combat mission and on 17 November 1971 the 12th TFW was inactivated. On 23 December 12 Security Police Squadron was inactivated as the RVNAF took over base security. On 1 January 1972 the base was formally turned over to the RVNAF. RVNAF use VNAF UH-1 at Ph√π C√°t c.1970 VNAF A-37s at Ph√π C√°t c.1972 The 412st Transport Squadron formed at the base in 1970 operating C-7As inherited from the 537th Troop Carrier Squadron. The 243rd Helicopter Squadron operating UH-1 gunships was based here. On 17 May 1974 the base was attacked by the PAVN 2nd Regiment, 3rd Division. The attack was repulsed by the 108th and 263rd Battalions of the South Vietnamese Regional Forces. Capture of Ph√π C√°t Air Base In mid-March 1975 Qui Nhon and Ph√π C√°t AB were defended by the ARVN 40th Regiment and the B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Regional Forces, however the 40th Regiment was soon redeployed to Khanh Duong to keep open the route for ARVN escaping from Bu√¥n Ma Thu·ªôt. The 2nd Air Division provided air support for the 22nd Division and was also trying to destroy equipment abandoned during the evacuation of Pleiku. On the morning of 30 March the Regional Forces defending the base abandoned their positions and by afternoon the base was under attack by VC who were held back by the base security forces. With more VC gathering for renewed attacks, the base commander contacted the 92nd Air Wing at Phan Rang AB for help. The Wing commander, Colonel Le Van Thao organised a flight of 40 A-37s and they carried out a night attack on the base perimeter successfully breaking up the attack. On the morning of 31 March, the 2nd Air Division evacuated the base taking 32 aircraft, but abandoning a further 50; the PAVN/VC occupied the base that afternoon.

She is the author of a blog, Naturopathic Diaries, where she writes about being trained and having practiced as a licensed naturopath and about the problems with naturopaths as medical practitioners. Hermes' writings deal with the education and practices of licensed naturopaths in North America, and she is a noted opponent of alternative medicine. Hermes has been dubbed a whistleblower on the naturopathic profession and a \\"naturopathic apostate\\". Early life, education and career Hermes was born and grew up in California, and in 2002 graduated from Oak Park High School in Ventura County, California. Hermes has said that she became interested in natural medicine while in high school to treat her psoriasis, and that \\"A bad experience with a doctor as a teen pushed her to pursue a career in naturopathic medicine\\". In 2006, she graduated from San Diego State University with a bachelor's degree in psychology (magna cum laude) and earned membership in the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. Hermes received her N.D. in 2011 from Bastyr University in Kenmore, Washington. She was first licensed as a Naturopathic Physician in Washington state, where she then completed a one-year residency at a naturopathic clinic in Seattle focused on pediatrics and family medicine. Prior to graduating from the N.D. program, Hermes travelled to Ghana and Nicaragua with other students from Bastyr to provide naturopathic care to rural communities. Hermes moved to Tucson, Arizona, where she practiced until 2014 using the title ‚Äúnaturopathic medical doctor.‚Äù There she worked in an outpatient naturopathic clinic. She had a Federal DEA number that allowed her to prescribe controlled substances. And in her practice, she prescribed drugs and ordered tests like X-rays, MRIs, and blood work. After witnessing illegal and unethical treatments of cancer patients and discerning that such practices were common in her field, due to poor education and low professional standards, she decided to leave the practice of naturopathy. She reported her boss, Michael Uzick, to the Arizona authorities for importing and administering a non-FDA approved substance called Ukrain to terminally ill cancer patients. Uzick was given a letter of reprimand by the Arizona Naturopathic Physicians Board of Examiners. Hermes characterized this disciplinary action as a \\"token punishment\\" and a \\"slap on the wrist.\\" She reported that a former president of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians recommended that she not report Uzick to the authorities, which cemented her departure from the naturopathic profession. In 2016 Hermes studied for an MSc in biomedicine at the University of Kiel in Germany specialising in the mammalian microbiome. , Hermes is a doctoral candidate at Kiel in evolutionary genomics, studying the signatures of co- adoptation between microbes that are living on humans and the human genome. Hermes was joint winner of the 2018 John Maddox Prize, awarded by Sense about Science. As an \\"early career researcher 'in recognition of her advocacy and writing on evidence-based medicine'\\". Judge Colin Blakemore stated that \\"Hermes's story is one of exceptional courage\\". Naturopathic Diaries The Skeptic magazine at QED In 2015, Hermes started a blog, Naturopathic Diaries, that is \\"aimed at contextualizing the false information proliferated by the naturopathic profession.\\" Hermes is concerned with a lack of informed consent when naturopaths practice and the failure of naturopaths to employ science-based medicine. Her blog provides an insider's perspective on how naturopaths practice and are trained. Naturopathic Diaries was given the 2016 Ockham Award for Best Blog by The Skeptic magazine. Hermes has documented that naturopathic organizations make misleading claims about naturopathic education in comparison to the training of medical doctors. She contends that accredited naturopathic programs do not adequately prepare students to become competent medical practitioners. Hermes argues that naturopaths are not able to recognize serious health conditions and treat according to the standard of care due to inadequate medical training. Hermes has described her experiences observing licensed naturopaths frequently misdiagnosing patients and providing inappropriate medical advice, such as advising against vaccinations and treating cancer with alternative methods. She has characterized naturopathic methods, especially ones using vitamins and supplements, as lacking adequate scientific evidence and based on exaggerated health claims. Hermes' views are consistent with and elaborate upon previous criticisms of naturopathic education and practice. Advocacy Hermes believes that naturopathic doctors are misrepresenting their medical competency to the public and lawmakers. She maintains the following policy positions on the regulation of naturopathic doctors: * Naturopaths should not be permitted to use the title \\"doctor\\" or \\"physician\\" because this misleads patients into thinking naturopaths have medical training commensurate with that of physicians practicing evidence- based medicine. * Naturopaths should be prohibited from treating children. She highlights the case of a Canadian toddler who died and whose parents faced criminal charges for not providing him with prudent medical care for his fatal bacterial meningitis, which included seeking treatment by a licensed naturopath in Alberta who prescribed him a tincture of echinacea. However it turns out that the naturopathic doctor in question never saw or examined the child ‚Äî or even knew that the herbal remedy was for someone with the deadly illness, moreover the parents themselves never suspected the toddler might have meningitis especially that the child was seen by a nurse who told them she didn't see anything obviously wrong with the toddler, yet advised them to go to emergency anyway. * Naturopaths should not be granted medical licenses, and where they are already licensed their scope of practice should be reduced. Hermes started a Change.org petition, \\"Naturopaths are not doctors\\", to raise awareness of the shortcomings of naturopathic medicine and the naturopathic profession's political agenda of gaining licensure in 50 U.S. states by 2025 and participation in Medicare. Naturopaths, including the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, have accused her of defamation against the naturopathic profession. ''' When she was asked in an interview about the harm that could come from believing naturopathy, she responded, # Cost \\"these treatments could be very expensive sometimes costing thousands of dollars. # Believing in magic \\"patients would forego conventional treatments, and this... Can delay treatment or preventing them getting the treatment that could potentially save their life.\\" Speaking at CSIcon Las Vegas 2017, Hermes described herself as delusional regarding her naturopathic education, describing the teaching at naturopathic schools as pseudoscience. In a separate interview in 2018 she commented on one of the distinctions between naturopathic medicine and science-based medicine stating that \\"When you‚Äôre going through naturopathic school, we‚Äôre told that what we‚Äôre being taught is evidence-based or science-based. These are different things. Evidence-based doesn‚Äôt mean the same thing as science-based. Homeopathy is a really good example to try to differentiate these terms. You can find evidence, even randomized controlled trials, that make it look like homeopathy might work. You pull from that body of research. You cherry-pick those studies. Now you have an evidence-based therapy. Science-based means that it‚Äôs actually plausible. Homeopathy is not science-based. It‚Äôs nonsense. It breaks the laws of physics. It‚Äôs not plausible. The argument is that we should make sure something is science-based before we even move on to studying it. It should pass the science test first\\". An anonymous blog was set up that has attempted to pick apart Hermes's claims by citing low-quality studies by naturopaths in defense of naturopathic practices. Hermes also contributes to Science-Based Medicine, KevinMD, Science 2.0., and Forbes. Lawsuit US-based naturopath Colleen Huber filed a defamation lawsuit against Hermes in Germany over her statements about natural cancer treatments and research which were published in a blog post about Huber.Devlin, Hannah (March 27, 2018) \\"The naturopath whistleblower: ‚ÄòIt is surprisingly easy to sell snake oil‚Äô\\", The Guardian. Retrieved June 23, 2020. The lawsuit was filed in Kiel, Germany on September 17, 2017. Australian Skeptics managed a fundraising campaign to assist Hermes in her defense.

(Perfected Spelling: Selamat Berjuang, Masku!, Indonesian for \\"Fight Well, My Brother!\\") is a 1951 Indonesian film directed by R.H. Andjar Subyanto and starring Raden Sukarno and Marlia Hardi. It follows a former guerrilla leader who must pursue his love despite the interference of his former comrades. Plot During the Indonesian National Revolution, Herman (Raden Sukarno) is the leader of a group of guerrillas, including the womanizing artist Wurjanto (A. Hamid Arief), the arrogant Abdul Rais (Chatir Harro), the trader Amin (A. Bakar), and the former office worker Katsina (Darussalam). After the war, only Herman maintains his ideology and joins the Indonesian Air Force, whereas his fellow guerrillas return to their respective fields. He also maintains a loving relationship with Parmi (Marlia Hardi), and stays faithful to her despite intervention from Herman's former colleagues, including Wurjanto, who has stolen the heart of Surti (Netty Herawaty), a young village woman. Production Selamat Berdjuang, Masku! was written and directed by R.H. Andjar Subyanto (credited as H. Asby) for Djakarta Film, a subsidiary of Fred Young's Bintang Surabaja. It was his second film for the company, following Pelarian dari Pagar Besi (1951). The black-and-white film starred Raden Sukarno and Marlia Hardi in the lead roles, supported by A. Hamid Arief and Netty Herawaty. The film also featured Chatir Harro, A. Bakar, Darussalam, Musa, Wolly Sutinah, Pak Ali, and Rochani in various parts. Selamat Berdjuang, Masku! was produced at during a period when several companies were producing films about or touching on the Indonesian National Revolution, including Perfini (Darah dan Doa, 1950; Enam Djam di Jogja, 1951), Persari (Sepandjang Malioboro, 1950; Hampir Malam di Djogja, 1951), and Bintang Surabaja (Djembatan Merah, 1950). The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that, aside from those films produced by Perfini, none of these productions dealt with the nationalistic ideals and struggle underlying the revolution. The film critic Salim Said, however, argues that the depiction of waylaid guerrillas in Embun (Perfini, 1952) and Selamat Berdjuang, Masku! led to a decline in the production of films about the revolution. Release Selamat Berdjuang, Masku! was released in 1951, with its Malang debut on 15 August of that year--two days before independence day celebrations. A novelisation, by Suma Indra, was published by Gapura in their Roman Layar Putih ('Silver Screen Novels') series.

It is a property of the Free State of Saxony and is administrated by the company State Palaces, Castles and Gardens of Saxony.  Geography  The castle is located on a spur above the river Freiberger Mulde, at the northern edge of the town of Leisnig proper and opposite the village of Fischendorf. The rock is a former lava dome and consists of pre-mesozoic rhyolite, in particular the so- called Leisniger Quarzporphyr.  History  Illustration by Johann Kamprad (1753) There is archeological evidence for an ancient settlement on the rock spur above Freiberger Mulde. Mildenstein castle was probably built in the 10th century. However, it was first mentioned only in 1046 when Emperor Heinrich III gifted the Burgwards of Colditz, Rochlitz, and Leisnig to Agnes of Poitou. In 1084 the castle was enfeoffed by Emperor Heinrich IV to Wiprecht of Groitzsch. In 1143 it went by marriage to Franconian earl Rapoto von Abenberg, Stiftsvogt of Bamberg, who sold it in 1148 to Duke Friedrich III of Schwaben who later became known as Emperor Barbarossa. The latter made the castle in 1158 an imperial property, tied to the office of the Emperor and enfeoffed to the Burgraves of Leisnig. As such, it became a governing centre of the Imperial Territory of Plei√üenland. In the early 13th century the castle was the seat of the imperial ministeriales family von Mildenstein who had to give up their properties in the area after they lost a dispute over the entitlement to tithes from former church properties, and Margrave Henry the Illustrious captured the castle in 1232.Codex diplomaticus Saxoniae regiae. Part I, volume 3, p. 475 The Burgraves of Leisnig founded Buch Abbey in 1192 and acquired the lordship of Mutzschen before 1308. They became one of the most powerful families in the area. Burgrave Otto I of Leisnig, together with his father-in- law, Burgrave Albrecht IV of Altenburg, also gained the lordships of Lauterstein (1323) and Waldheim (1324), and inherited the lordship of Rochsburg from the latter in 1329. However, the joined √Ñmter Leisnig and Altenburg fell to Margrave Frederick the Serious after Albrecht IV died in 1329. The Leisnigs lost their imperial immediacy, were forced to sell their burgraviate in 1365, kept only their possessions around Rochsburg and Penig and died out in 1538. Mildenstein castle was rebuilt in the late 14th century under Margrave Wilhelm I. It was, however, not used as a residence, but remained the seat of the local government (Amt Leisnig). Castle and town suffered heavy damage during the Thirty Years' War. In 1706/1707 it was chosen as a residence by Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski, who had been elected anti-king to Augustus the Strong. Later in the 18th century the castle housed the regional court of law, a prison and apartments for officials. Beginning in 1798, the local Mirus family had a romantic park constructed around the castle, which is notable for its artificial ruins and a rock tunnel built in 1866. Since 1890 Mildenstein castle has been used as a museum. A small zoo was also established in the park, but closed in 1990.  Buildings  Bergfried in the inner courtyard Pagenhaus (squires' quarters) Roof construction of the granary Herrenhaus (Lord's residence) The chapel dates from the 12th century and was rebuilt around 1400. The Bergfried in the inner courtyard dates from the late 12th century. It is high and has a diameter of . Its lower part is built from locally found quartzite blocks, above a height of bricks have been used. Due to increasing dilapidation it was partly dismantled in 1791. Since its restoration in 1875 it has been used as an observation tower. The second Bergfried in the outer ward was built in the 1st half of the 13th century. The gatehouse originates from the late 12th/early 13th century while the granary with its impressive roof structure, the Herrenhaus (Lord's residence), and the Pagenhaus (squires' quarters) were rebuilt under Margrave Wilhelm I near the end of the 14th century.  Attractions  Giant boot in Mildenstein museum (2008) From 1957 until 2010 the museum had been home to the Giant Boot of D√∂beln, a high riding boot which had been manufactured in 1925 on occasion of the 600th anniversary of the shoemaker's guild of D√∂beln and is now shown in D√∂beln town hall. In 1996, two Leisnig shoemakers presented another, high boot that is exhibited in a building near the castle and is regularly shown on parades.

Krotscheck) under the leadership of professor Michael Narodoslawsky. The SPI is a member of the ecological footprint family which aggregates and compares different ecological pressures. It allows to evaluate ecologic impacts of industrial products and services like energy production, industrial products, agriculture and buildings. It provides an encompassing evaluation that distinguishes sharply between fossil and renewable energy (as Global warming potential does) but taking other emissions to soil water and atmosphere into account as well. Based on the idea, that the primary income of the earth is Solar radiation, in accordance with the principle of Strong sustainability the surface of the earth is the basic dimension of the evaluation. The SPI is therefore in the same family of ecological measurement as the Ecological Footprint. These methods all measure the area that is necessary to support human activities. The SPI takes the whole life cycle into consideration starting from mining of raw materials to further transformation and production of goods to recycling to disposal of waste. This includes grey emissions, the emissions which originate from production and operation of infrastructures. The SPI method is based on the comparison of natural material fluxes with technological material fluxes. The conversion of mass and energy fluxes is strongly defined by two principles of Sustainability.2\\\\. SUSTAIN report: Umsetzung nachhaltiger Entwicklung in √ñsterreich (engl.

Island Press, Washington DC, 1991. * Principle 2: Anthropogenic material flows must not exceed the local assimilation capacity and should be smaller than natural fluctuations in geogenic flows. The SPI is the ratio of two areas. One is the area needed to embed a life cycle to generate a product or service in the Biosphere. The other is the statistical area available for every human being on earth, which is m¬≤ based on a global population of 7.39 billion people. Contrary to the Ecological Footprint the SPI also takes ocean surface into account, as oceans are key elements of many global material cycles (e.g. the Carbon cycle). * SPI << 1 a SPI very much smaller than one means that the service (process, activity) is very ‚Äòcheap‚Äô for sustainability (e.g. goods of daily consume) * 0.001 < SPI < 1 a SPI between zero and one means that the evaluated service (process, activity) can be suitable for the Sustainable Development * SPI > 1 a SPI bigger than one means that the service (process, activity) is too inefficient for Sustainability ‚Äì the benefit is too ‚Äòexpensive‚Äô The earth‚Äô surface and the atmosphere are complex buildings several compartments have to be considered for a comprehensive ecological evaluation. The SPI includes natural renewable rates, absorption rates and natural exchange rates of substances within and between the compartments air, soil and water. Practically this is defined with maximal rates of material and energy flows which can be absorbed by natural sinks of biosphere.  Method  Human activities influence the natural environment in many different ways. Processes needed to execute these activities need resources, energy and human manpower. Production, delivery and consummation of goods generates emissions and waste. The SPI includes all these different issues affecting the environment. A total area Atot which would be needed to embed human activities into ecosphere can so be aggregated. Atot = AR \\\\+ AE \\\\+ AI \\\\+ AS \\\\+ AP [m2] (1) AR = ARR \\\\+ ARF \\\\+ ARN [m2] (2) AI = AID \\\\+ AII [m2] (3) The sum for the total area is the sum of all partial areas (formula 1). AR, the area needed to provide raw materials, is the sum (formula 2) of all areas needed to provide renewable resources (ARR), fossil resources (ARF) and non-renewable resources (ARN). AE is the area needed to provide process energy (incl. electricity). AI, the area needed to provide the infrastructure for the process is the sum (formula 3) of direct land use (AID) and the area needed to provide the area for buildings and process plants (AII). AS is the area needed for the supply of the staff and AP is the area needed for a sustainable embedding of emissions and waste into ecosphere. The SPI aggregates partial footprints from mass, energy and emission inventories of every sub-process and refers them to the end product. This means that Atot is the total footprint of a considered product per measurement unit. Seven different categories were defined to guarantee a better visibility of the different impact categories: * Direct land consumption * Consumption of non-renewable resources * Consumption of renewable resources * Consumption of fossil resources * Emissions to air * Emissions to water * Emissions to soil  Fields of application  The SPI is applied for different ecological evaluations. Examples are: * Renewable energy: renewable bioenergy system integrationEcological assessment of integrated bioenergy systems using the sustainable process index; Krotscheck, C.; K√∂nig, F.; Obernberger, I.; Biomass and Bioenergy (2000), 18 (4), 341-368 * Renewable energy supplyEcological footprint ‚Äî a tool for assessing sustainable energy supplies; St√∂glehner, G.; Journal of Cleaner Production 11 (2003), 267‚Äì277Sustainable Process Index; Narodoslawsky, M.; Niederl, A.; In Renewable-Based Technology: Sustainability Assessment (2005); Ed: Dewulf, J.; van Langhove, H., John Wiley & Sons * Personal footprint calculator * Footprint evaluation for schools, Energy Scouts * Ecological footprint for agriculture * Lifestyle: Greengang vs. Captain CarbonGame Greengang vs. Captain Carbon: http://game.greengang.at/  References   External links  * SPI on Web * Fu√üabdrucksrechner * Greengang vs. Captain Carbon Category:Sustainability metrics and indices ","title":"Sustainable Process Index"},{"id":"50420063","text":"Sekhem-ankh-Ptah (also Sekhemankhptah and Sekhemankh-Ptah) was an ancient Egyptian high official who lived during the Old Kingdom period.

The fires were caused by a heatwave that spread across Uttarakhand and were the worst recorded in the region with a reported of forest burnt down and seven people dead. Officials detected nearly 1,600 total fires which were brought under control by 2 May, and as rain fell the following day, it reduced the impact of the wildfires. An initial report on 4 May noted that had been destroyed by the fire.  History and causes  Forest fires caused by humans in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand have been a regular event. Since the formation of the state in 2000, more than of forest land has been lost to fire. Some fires during 1921, 1930, and 1942 have been associated with popular movements against the then British government's forestry policies and as a call for independence. Most of these fires occur in the chir pine (Pinus roxburghii) zone which is prone to fire. Burnt Chir Pine But the pine itself is resistant to the fire. Instead of harming them, these fires help in their regeneration by reducing coverage of broad-leaf trees, which leads to an increase in the land covered by chir pine and oak. The broad-leaved forest is dominated by oak species, including Banj oak (Quercus leucotrichophora). Resin is harvested from these pines, and fires are often intentionally set to remove the carpet of pine needles that come in the way of harvesting activity. In June 1981, a blanket ban was introduced against the felling of standing trees 1000 meters above sea level, a ban that prohibits the removal of pine trees in the areas where they are invading. Apart from accidental fires, several causes and motivations for setting fires have been noted which include encroachment on forest lands and concealing illegal timber extraction. Major illicit timber trade relies on pine forests since it is often used for construction. A major cause for the fires was attributed to the record high temperatures and severe lack of rainfall due to a dry winter. The Uttarakhand forest fires had also come as India suffered one of its worst droughts in years with the government noting over 330 million were affected by water shortages.  Early 2016 events and controversy  The forest fires began on February 2, 2016, and went initially unnoticed for several weeks, while Parliament was in a state of outrage over the presidential rule which had been imposed on Uttarakhand Consequently, these fires went largely unchecked and spread from the pine forests on the slopes of the sub-Himalayan region to the oak and broadleaf forests which resulted in heavy clouds of smoke that changed the usually blue skies to grey. This smoke affected tourism within the state and fearing bad publicity, the locals did not report the fires. The conservationist Ela Smetacek started a public awareness campaign to highlight the damage from the fires calling on the Indian government to address the issue. Her Facebook post was shared over 58,000 times as it showed the entire hillsides ablaze with walls of flames engulfing even the tallest trees. The campaign gathered widespread support from social media users and Indian media which led to a series of claims and counter-claims between the environment minister, the conservationist, and other activists ensued, as Smetacek blamed the timber and builder mafia for the purposely-lit fires, stating that 1,300 fires could be seen from NASA satellite pictures and that an arson attack across the state was evident. The post demanding the fires be recognized as a national emergency, and the need of immediate deployment of NDRF teams, led to the government taking action, deploying the National Disaster Response Force and making use of Indian Air Force Mi-17 helicopters fitted with \\"Bambi buckets\\" to douse the fires with water. Seven fatalities were reported . The Pinegrove School, a boarding school at Kasauli, was evacuated as fires had reached its compound walls. Tourism and wildlife at the Jim Corbett National Park and Rajaji Tiger reserve regions were affected. Various other locations in these Himalayan states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh are tourist attractions in summer, and they now face heavy air pollution. The forest fires also disrupted the functioning of the Kalka‚ÄìShimla Railway line. On 3 May, the forest department estimated the monetary losses at approximately . The estimate is based on the standard rule book followed by the department with empirical formulae for such calculations. Various ecologists and environmental activists have disregarded the estimate, noting that it does not take into account ecological and wildlife losses. They added that these fires have also destroyed vegetation which holds rainfall, which might result in floods in the monsoon season. Scientists of the Govind Ballabh Pant Institute of Himalayan Environment and Development formed a team to survey the area and study the effects of the fires on the melting of glaciers. Ecologists suggested that clearing of forest floors of the fallen pine leaves, which are readily combustible, should be undertaken by the forest department as well as locals on a grassroots level to prevent such major fire outbreaks. Production of biomass briquettes from these pine needles should be promoted, serving as a source of fuel as well as a solution to prevent wildfires. On 30 April, the National Disaster Response Force was deployed for rescue operations in the Kumaon and Garhwal areas. Around 6,000 personnel from the Forest Department were deployed. , 922 incidences of fire were reported affecting around of forest area. The Mi-17 helicopters of the Indian Air Force with \\"Bambi buckets\\" were used to douse the fires with water. However, the heavy smog that developed in the area affected the aerial operations of the army. The affected area later increased to around , extending into Himachal Pradesh. The regions saw rainfalls on 3 May ranging from 7mm to 11mm, which helped in controlling the fire. Soaring temperatures reignited the forest fires on 18 May 2016 covering an area of nearly 180 hectares of green land spreading over 111 districts. Rangers and Divisional Forest Officers rush to the spot and extinguish the fire as soon as possible to reduce the damage done. This was the result of the temperatures of Uttarakhand which were about 4 to 5 degrees higher than the average temperatures at this time of the year. According to government sources, the forest fires combined have destroyed nearly 4,048 hectares of land, in 1,857 incidents. Subsequently, the World Bank granted 500 crores rupees (US$75M) to the Uttarakhand forest department to research the cause of the forest fires, which was later increased by 600 crores (US$90M). The Indian central government later announced a series of funds amounting to over 50,000 crores (US$7.5B) to go towards afforestation across the state of Uttarakhand and the country. Vegetation destroyed in a forest near Dhaulinag Temple in Bageshwar district Controversy and long term impact Reports were published in the local media which variously blamed both the local people and timber companies for the forest fires. Environmental journalist Bahar Dutt blamed the television media for their \\"Delhi centrist world view\\" that disregarded the historical and ecological natural causes of fire, due to the high density of pine trees that increases the fire hazards. Various tourism- related associations suggested that the exaggerated representation of the fires by the media could reduce tourism, a major part of the state economy. Part of a team of conservationists and biologists who studied the private and state forests since 1950, Smetacek maintained forest fires did not occur naturally in the geographical topography of the region concerned. Natural fires are not seen anywhere in Indian forests, she added. The introduction of pine trees by the British caused a more volatile fuel to the (man-made) fires. Fires directly destroy biodiversity and have indirect long-term impacts, including the encouragement of fire and pioneer species. It has been suggested that the dark carbon dust emitted by the fires deposited on Himalayan glaciers could hasten the glaciers' melting. This could affect the hydrology of the rivers that are a source of water for human populations in northern India. The average temperature of northern India saw an increase of 0.2 ¬∞C.

History Clock Software was incorporated in 1994 in Varna, Bulgaria, under the name Clock Ltd (–ö–ª–æ–∫ –û–û–î). Initially, the company specialized in selling hardware and peripherals but soon switched its focus to the development of hotel software. In 1996, Clock launched their first property management system called ClockFront for Windows. At the time, a huge privatisation was going on as part of the transition of the country to democracy and market economy. All hotels previously owned by the state were changing ownership and needed new software to replace previous, often centralised, management systems. Clock Software took the chance to offer their software to the newly privatised hotels. In 2006, Clock Software started to expand to countries outside Bulgaria and opened offices in Romania (2007) and Croatia (2008). The first markets where their products were adopted were Romania, Macedonia and Croatia. In 2010, Clock took the decision to create a completely new hospitality software suite based on cloud technology. The new product was built around the idea of consolidation of separate applications into one cloud-based platform and switching from data-focused to guest-centred software model. A new branch was registered in London, UK under the name of Clock Software Ltd. to take over the international development and the distribution of the cloud-based software products, while the Bulgarian branch remained in charge of software development and support. Clock Software launched their first cloud product, the free Internet reservation system InnHand, in 2012. In 2013, it launched the hotel management platform Clock PMS+. A year later InnHand was discontinued and the company focused entirely on the new system. In 2016, the company released its first hardware device, a self-service kiosk. Distribution and partners Its Windows-based installable software solutions Clock Software offers in Eastern Europe, while the latest cloud-based hotel management platform, Clock PMS+, is available globally. Clock PMS+ has customers in 65+ countries (as of the end of 2018) with Lark Hotels and McMillan Hotels among them.

Min was also a founding member of the National Organization for Women.  Early life  Born in Chicago in 1909, Min was one of eight children. Min's father was a cigar maker, and he was a prominent labor leader who often staged rallies and strikes in the cigar industry. Min saw much of the violence within the mafia controlled labor industries, and her father's career in organizing labor workers inspired her to do the same. Min met her husband, Bill, when she was 19. The two moved to New York City and began careers with in the garment industry. Min worked within a dress factory until her husband accepted a position with the ILGWU. Min and her husband had two children, and Min remained out of union affairs for years to raise them.  The ILGWU  The ILGWU was one of the largest labor unions within the United States and had branches in many states including Pennsylvania and New York. Women had significant involvement within the ILGWU. The organization branched from so- called run-away shops. These shops got their name because they deviated from the manufacturer-contractor system that was the norm in the 20th century. In this system, wholesalers received orders from retailers directly, and independently run sub-manufacturers filled the orders. Competition between sub-manufacturers allowed for the wholesalers to lower prices. Min began her work with the ILGWU in 1944 with her husband when the two left for northeastern Pennsylvania. The two were ordered simply \\"to clean up the mess down there\\" amid strife among garment workers and a strong presence of organized crime.11th Congressional record, volume 145 (1999) (Statement of Representative Paul E. Kanjorski) Runaway shops began to take hold of northeastern Pennsylvania due to the declining economic landscape of the area and due to the close proximity to New York. Min faced opposition from organized crime bosses including Russell Alfred Bufalino. These crime bosses ensured prevention of union protests and the like which served to harm local businesses despite worker grievances. Crime bosses such as Bufalino often used garment factories as fronts for various illegal activities. Crime bosses also often bribed the police as an attempt to weaken the unions. When Min came to Wilkes-Barre in 1944, there were only six organized businesses with a total of 650 union members. Upon her departure in 1963, Min left Wilkes-Barre with 168 organized factories and over 11,000 ILGWU members. The ILGWU contributed to workers‚Äô personal lives in addition to their work lives. Education opportunities were presented in the form of scholarships and classes offered at Wilke‚Äôs College. Heath benefits such as a health center, maternity benefits, and death benefits were also offered to members of the ILGWU with Min‚Äôs help.  Later career  Min was one of the founding members of the National Organization for Women, or NOW. The group‚Äôs main goal is equal rights for women by bringing women into mainstream American society. Upon retirement, Min and her husband returned to northeastern Pennsylvania in 1972, only one year before a catastrophic flood of the Susquehanna River devastated the area. Once the flood hit, Min, despite being retired, played a key role in organizing the Flood Victims Action Council. Min's efforts resulted in relief efforts supported by the Federal government to aid reconstruction of Wyoming Valley.  Death  Min died on December 8, 1992 at age 83 in the Wilkes-Barre General Hospital. Min now has a historical marker dedicated in her name for her accomplishments in Wilkes-Barre with the ILGWU. The marker was dedicated on September 24, 1999, and it is located in Wilkes-Barre‚Äôs Public Square.

Her causes included women's rights, school integration, collective bargaining, and minority rights. She most famously led the Virginia lobby for the Equal Rights Amendment and was the first president of the Virginia chapter of the National Organization for Women. She was the first woman to run for statewide office in Virginia.  Personal life  Flora Marina Trimmer was born on April 19, 1914, in Costa Rica. She was the daughter of a Nicaraguan mother and an American father, and later described her upbringing as very traditional. After living in Cuba, New York City, and Washington, D.C., the family moved to Orange, Virginia, when Crater was a child. She graduated from Orange High School and moved to Washington, D.C. where she married Walter James Crater (d. 1982). They had three children.  Education  As a young woman, Crater attended Strayer College in Washington, D.C., but did not graduate. At the age of 67 she received her bachelor's degree from George Mason University.  Career  Flora Crater engaged in politics to fight for women, African Americans, the poor and young people. She first became involved in politics in 1942, when as a member of her children's Parent-Teacher Association, she advocated for educational issues in Fairfax County. In particular, she lobbied against the policies of Wallace Carper, chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, a Democrat aligned with Harry F. Byrd Jr. In 1945, Crater supported Ed Lynch's successful campaign against Carper to represent Fairfax County in the General Assembly. In the 1950s and 1960s, Crater was active in Democratic leadership in Fairfax and Virginia's 10th congressional district, in an era when the party was struggling with internal conflicts over major issues such as Massive Resistance. She worked in a number of positions in the Fairfax Democratic Committee and served as a precinct chair for Joseph H. Freehill's unsuccessful 1958 campaign for Congress and as Fairfax County chair for William C. Battle's unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign in 1968. In 1966, Crater ran for office for the first time, seeking a seat on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, but was not elected in her heavily Republican district. The same year, Crater was appointed to the newly created Fairfax Redevelopment and Housing Authority, an organization that sought to provide low-income housing in the suburban county. Under her leadership, the Authority created 150 low-income-housing units, but Crater resigned when the organization came under scrutiny for poor financial management, and soon turned her attention to feminism. = Women's rights = In 1970, Crater's daughter-in-law, Frances Mae Kubitz Crater, a member of the National Organization for Women in New Jersey, asked Crater to help her arrange a meeting with her senator to discuss the Equal Rights Amendment. Inspired by what she learned during this experience, Crater founded the Northern Virginia Chapter of NOW and began holding meetings in her home, combining political strategy sessions, protest planning, and consciousness raising. She moved swiftly into a leadership position, becoming chair of NOW's Ad Hoc Committee on the Equal Rights Amendment, which was bolstered by the support of more than 25 political, religious, and labor organizations. In 1971, she became head of the Virginia chapter of the National Women's Political Caucus, an organization that sought to increase the representation of women in politics. On August 26, 1970, Crater attended the Women's Strike for Equality in Washington, D.C. As a representative of NOW, she presented a petition and two pink paper flowers to Senate leaders, urging passage of the ERA. The flowers were to become a familiar sight at Washington ERA events in the years to come, symbolizing Crater's first name, as well as the women she represented. In 1971, Crater started publishing \\"The Woman Activist\\", an action letter that reached a national readership, sharing information about feminist issues. It contained advice for feminists on how to lobby, campaign, and perform other political activities, as well as groundbreaking analyses of national politics. For instance, the New York Times published an article in 1972 summarizing the newsletter's findings on House votes on feminist issues, breaking down the votes on gender and race lines. After the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment by Congress, Crater lobbied for its ratification by the states, and specifically Virginia. Crater convened the Virginia Equal Rights Amendment Ratification Council, which brought together more than thirty organizations to fight for the ERA. In 1977 Crater became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press.  \\"Crater's Raiders\\"  Crater led a group of lobbyists, made up mostly of NOW members, who were instrumental in pushing the U.S. Congress's passage of the Equal Rights Amendment in 1972, and which led the fight for the passage of the ERA in Virginia from that point on. They were retroactively dubbed \\"Crater's Raiders\\", and were known for handing out pink paper flowers, in reference to Crater's first name. = Campaigns for political office = * In 1973, Crater ran unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, with the goal of gaining visibility for women's rights. She ran as an independent candidate and received 10.5 percent of the votes, mostly from Democrats and women. She was the first woman to run for statewide office in Virginia. * In 1978, Crater sought the Democratic nomination for United States senator for Virginia. She received only two delegates.  Archives  Flora Crater's papers, which run to more than 260 boxes, are held at the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia. Records of the Virginia Equal Rights Amendment Ratification Council are held at the Library of Virginia.

It was first described in 1909 by Maurice Caullery. Originally it was thought to be a subgenus of Distoma. Eudistoma is the most species-rich genus in the family Polycitordae, with 124 valid species as of 2014. They are found in tropical and temperate waters; some species are also found in the Antarctic and subtropical area. Description In 1909 Caullery described Eudistoma as a subgenus of Distoma due to the rows of stigmata in the pharynx. In 1917 Ritter and Forsyth described it as a separate genus without explanation. Three subsequent papers published in 1919, 1921 and 1942 all considered it to be a subgenus of Polycitor. Eudistoma was finally considered a valid genus in 1945 due to \\"the three rows of pharyngeal slits, long esophagus, flat stomach in the posterior region of the abdomen, very conspicuous longitudinal muscles extending from the pharynx to the end of the abdomen and larvae that are incubated in the atrial cavity.\\" Identification of species within the genus has been difficult at times due to the wide variety in shape and colour. Medical research Biologically active alkaloids have been isolated from a number of species of Eudistoma, some of which have been studied for their cytotoxic properties. A number of these substances have been grouped under the name eudistomin, though they are not only found in Eudistoma species. They are being investigated for their possible use as antibiotics and anti-cancer agents.

The Delaware and Hudson Coal Company's mine employed 450 workers and was located in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, about a mile from the center of the city near the modern day corner of North Sherman, Spring, and Pine Streets. Ninety-two miners were killed and 44 injured in the explosion, which was caused by the ignition of black blasting powder. Only 7 miners escaped without injury. Safety violations have been cited as a cause for the explosion, by sending miners into the mine with powder in their cart line. Testimony reinforced the theory that the likely cause was a loose power cable that came in contact with the trolley, though a later investigation thought that open flames were the more probable cause. It was one of the deadliest industrial disasters in Pennsylvania history and led to the prohibition of miners and explosives being transported at the same time.  Description  The Baltimore Mine Tunnel Disaster was an accidental explosion that occurred on June 5, 1919 just inside the mouth of Tunnel No. 2 in the Delaware and Hudson Coal Company's Baltimore Mine. The coal mine was located in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, about a mile from the center of the city. At the time, D&H; employed 450 workers at the mine. Ninety-two miners were killed in the explosion, which was caused by the ignition of black blasting powder. Another 44 miners were injured, with only 7 escaping unharmed. More than 100 miners were riding in \\"trip of mine cars\\" drawn by a motor, with at least one car carrying blasting powder. About from the entrance, the power cable's sparks detonated the powder. The ventilating shaft drew the flames into the tunnel toward the miners. Many survived the blast and were not immediately killed from the explosion; most of those who died were victims of severe burns and of smoke inhalation. Miners who were close to the explosion had their clothes set on fire. Only those who acted quickly enough were able to jump into small pools of water to put out the flames. As the injured and dead were removed from the mine, ambulances and doctors arrived relatively late since the accident happened at such an early hour and they had to be woken up.  Accounts of the accident  Of the men that went down into the mine and survived the explosion, a few stepped forward to share their experience during the explosion. Jacob Milz was a track layer who was positioned in the first car of a train in the tunnel, behind the cart motor. After feeling the shock of the explosion, Milz left the cart and crawled through the thickening smoke to the ‚ÄúG vein‚Äù where there was good circulation of air. Once he arrived at the G vein, he led the survivors with him on the rescue attempt. The majority of those injured, but not killed, were evacuated in an hour. In the aftermath of the accident, Mr. John McGroarty‚Äîthe motorman during the explosion‚Äîwas called upon to testify in front of the Pennsylvania Bureau of Mines and representatives from the Delaware and Hudson Coal Company, the company that owned the mine. McGroarty stated that he was stopped before entering the mine because of a fallen trolley cable. Upon entering the mine to fix the cable, he found the fallen cable and was going to order the power to be shut off, but the explosion stopped him before he could alert anyone. McGroarty was among the rescuers, but lost consciousness and woke up sitting in a hospital bed.  Possible causes  In the testimonies of survivors of the accident, it was reported that the cause was a loose power cable that came in contact with the trolley. The main testimony of John McGroarty before the chief of the Pennsylvania Bureau of Mines, Seward Button, and representatives of the Delaware and Hudson Coal Company stated that a bracket holding the conductor for the cart motor had fallen. According to McGroarty, his crew entered the mine to where the bracket fell and were going to request power to be shut off for repairs, but were stopped by the explosion. Most of the reports that came out the next day in newspapers printed the testimony of McGroarty and agreed with the other eyewitness accounts of survivors that were inside the tunnel at the time of the explosion. The exact way that the powder was ignited is unknown. Among the possible explanations are matches for lighting pipes and lanterns; a crowbar making contact with a live power cable, thereby creating sparks; or by a loose electrical cable. The causes of the tunnel explosion were reported through witness testimonies and through the formal investigation of the accident. In the formal investigation of the accident there were three possibilities proposed for what could have caused the ignition of the blasting powder: electrical sparks or current, open lanterns, and lighted tobacco pipes. For the topic of electricity, the main focus was on a drill or crowbar touching the power cable, or one of the cans was brought into direct contact with a low hanging power cable. This theory was concluded to be improbable since there were no drills or crowbars found in the debris and there were no signs of arcing from electricity. It was also concluded that the probability of a crew member placing a powder can on the edge of a mine cart in just the right spot to touch the power cable was also extremely low, since it would almost have to be done on purpose. The report goes on to conclude that electricity was an improbable cause because of the lack of arc burns on the mine carts and powder cans. The theories of an open lamp or a lit pipe igniting the powder were much more probable‚Äîas stated in the report‚Äîas lamps were found in the debris and attached to places near where powder would be located. It was also noted that miners would trade blasting powder if they did not bring enough for the day's job, allowing sparks from lit matches or tobacco pipes to contact the powder.  Legislative action  A historical marker was erected in 2013 to commemorate the disaster After the mine tunnel disaster, many questioned the laws regarding coal mining. It is also said that the safety regulations that were put in place at the time were not followed in their entirety, but the laws regarding the safety practices were too ambiguous to impose any punishments. The official report done on the accident stated that it was not the mining company's fault nor was it the miners‚Äô, because the laws in place were ambiguous and the mining code did not apply to the new mining techniques. The law cited in the report was Rule 1, Article XII, where the owner of the mine was responsible for every precaution that should be taken for the safety of workers. Other sources speak about the mining code of Pennsylvania being broken by sending miners into the mine with powder in their cart line. The mine code prevents the transportation of powder in the same mine train as workers. At the end of the legal report, a series of suggestions are stated in order to improve mining conditions, including restricting the distribution of blasting powder to employees, and recommending that the Governor William C. Sproul, should revise the laws focused on mining.

He is the former vice-president and now member of the Federal Committee of Awami Workers Party. He was born in Hunza Valley of Gilgit-Baltistan. Incarceration Baba Jan is currently serving a lifetime prison sentence after being convicted by an anti-terrorism court of participating in a protest against killing of a disaster-affected man and his son by police on August 11, 2011 at Aliabad Hunza. A massive landslide on 4 January 2010 hit Attabad village and blocked Hunza River, forming a 23 km lake which submerged several villages and left over 1,000 people homeless. Baba Jan organized the displaced people to lobby the government for compensation and rehabilitation. While several families were compensated, some 25 families had still not been compensated. On 11 August 2011, some of those families protested by blocking Karakoram Highway (KKH) on which the then Chief Minister of Gilgit-Baltistan Syed Mehdi Shah was due to travel. Police fired teargas and gunshots to disperse the protesters for the Chief Minister's convoy, killing a man and his son. When news of the killings spread through the Hunza Valley, angry protests erupted in many towns in which a number of government buildings and police stations were torched. Baba Jan was subsequently arrested and tortured, and charged under the Anti-Terrorism Act. In September 2011, an anti-terrorism court sentenced him and eleven other activists to life imprisonment. Human rights organizations have demanded Baba Jan's release, and an international petition for his release has been signed by Noam Chomsky, Tariq Ali, David Graeber, and several others. During his time in prison, it has been reported that Baba Jan has been involved in organizing prisoners and promoting sectarian tolerance between Sunnis and Shias. Participation in elections Despite his incarceration, he contested for a seat in the 2015 Gilgit- Baltistan Legislative Assembly elections as the Awami Workers Party's candidate for Constituency GBLA-6. He came in second place, losing out to Mir Ghazanfar Ali Khan of Hunza's ruling family, who was backed by the party of Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistan Muslim League (N). However Baba Jan garnered more votes than the other mainstream parties, including the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. In November 2015, Mir Ghazanfar Ali Khan was appointed by the Pakistani prime minister as the Governor of Gilgit-Baltistan, which made the GBLA-6 seat vacant. The by- election for the seat has been scheduled for 28 May 2016 and the Awami Workers Party announced that Baba Jan would again be its candidate for the constituency. On 30 April 2016, the returning officer rejected his nominations papers on the grounds that he was a convicted person serving a jail sentence. However, on 4 May 2016, a court accepted an appeal filed by Baba Jan's lawyers against the rejection of his nomination papers. The supreme appellate court of Gilgit-Baltistan postponed the election for a period of three weeks to complete hearing of two cases pending charged against Baba Jan.

The line is operated by a company owned by the city-owned \\"Shenyang Hunnan Modern Transport Co., Ltd\\" (51%) and RATP Dev Transdev Asia(49%). The new system was chosen for south Shenyang, because it is a less congested and planned area, and commuting between one place to another in that area has become a serious problem. It was selected as a partly battery operated system, because it will reduce use of overhead-wire, which makes an eyesore for some people. Another advantage of this type of tram is they will utilize much less electricity for using recharged battery, so it will reduce production of electricity lesser in power station, so it is more eco-friendly. =Timeline= * 1974 ‚Äì The last standard tram ran. * 2011 ‚Äì Construction of a partly battery powered tram was decided. * 2012 ‚Äì Official construction began. * 2013 ‚Äì Commercial service was opened on 15 August. * 2019 - Commercial service of Line 4 and Line 6 was opened on 6 January.

The island has many deep indentations, two of which define its northeastern lobe, which is known as Calderwood Neck. The Murch House is located on the southeastern part of Calderwood Neck, overlooking the channel that separates it from Penobscot Island. The house is a 1-1/2 story Cape style structure, built out of ashlar granite blocks, and covered by a gabled roof. The front facade is three bays wide, with a pair of sash windows flanking the entrance, offset to the right side of the facade. The interior is divided into four rooms on the ground floor, with a central chimney. Stairs leading up to the attic space are located along the north wall, in the chamber accessed from the main entrance. Also on the property is a 19th-century barn. It is long rectangular timber-frame structure, with a saltbox profile, that is set on sloping terrain with a fully exposed granite block foundation at the rear. Built about 1855, the house is the only documented granite dwelling on the island, which was well known in the 19th century for its granite. At the time of its construction, the quarries were just beginning to be exploited. This house was built by William Murch, a local mason, using stone quarried from a nearby outcrop. The house was owned for many years by members of the Murch family, who were typically fishermen also engage in subsistence-level farming.

Danish's art work meshes the concepts of art's engrossment with languages from around the world and framework with an element in humor, misinterpretation, improper translation and superstition. Her work, which incorporates various media including sculpture, photographs and video, has appeared in exhibitions at , De Appel Art Centre in Amsterdam, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and Kunsthall Oslo. In her work, Danish plays with language and structure, incorporating humour and misunderstanding. She also researches the subject matter of her work, going so far as to investigate the use of chewing gum by contemporary artists and in Egyptian cinema.

Back In X Minutes  In 2012, Dina Danish created a project called Back In X Minutes, where she pledged to produce thirty-five paintings mimicking Post-It notes. Each Post-It note reads: ‚ÄúBack in x minute(s),‚Äù depending on the edition (x=from 1‚Äì35). Her concept behind this project was to demonstrate the reality of machines in our world, which make countless identical standard sized Post-its. Dina stated that she wanted to make several identical standard sized Post-its because she is not a machine and, therefore, there would be slight differences in each piece in the series. The Admirer and The Admired  In 2016, Dina Danish collaborated with Jean- Baptiste Maitre on a series called The Admirer and The Admired. The project dives into the way artefacts relate to their displays. The Admirer and The Admired studies the way that objects from foreign cultures are often left out of major museum exhibits and how the subtle visuals of an exhibit are the first thing that audiences notice when viewing an exhibition. Danish and Maitre did extensive research and development while working on this series. They began the collaboration after recognizing a common interest in the way that forms are displayed and arranged in different museum spaces. The exhibition has been put on at both Tyson in Cologne and at the Institute of Art History at the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich.

The concept of oblivion described by the band is interpreted possibility in accordance with Nietzschean philosophy, where forgetfulness was described as an active force to forget what one suffers and afflicts us without getting caught in a spiral of negative feelings and depression. It is one way to react positively to life, to avoid further pain and suffering.

It is an era of technology, of multiculturalism, of the transformation of every aspect of the world around us. In this radical change, the individual must relocate ethically, socially and politically while men must reformulate their values, with the understanding that they do not own the world but rather share it with other natural beings. The album reached the 2nd position in the ‚ÄúSoundcheck‚Äù chart of Sonic Seducer again Sonic Seducer Magazine(DE) - April 2016 p. 74, 79. and was described as a hectic work of obsessive rhythm and markedly post-punk.

Career  Brillant served in Suffren's campaign in the Indian Ocean, taking part in the Battle of Cuddalore. She was the main unit of the French force that drove away Commodore Vernon's squadron at the Siege of Pondicherry on 10 August 1779, and distinguished herself at the Battle of Sadras. She was present at the battles of Negapatam under Captain Armand de Saint-F√©lix. In July 1782, in the wake of the Battle of Negapatam, Suffren transferred Saint- F√©lix to Art√©sien and replaced him with Jean Andr√© de Pas de Beaulieu, of Bellone. The frigate Pourvoyeuse had to give her mainmast to replace that of Brillant, receiving herself that of Fortitude. In the reshuffling of Suffren's captains in July, his nephew Pierrevert had been given command of Bellone, but shortly afterwards Pierrevert was killed in the Action of 12 August 1782. Consequently, Suffren returned Beaulieu to Bellone, and replaced him on Brillant with Lieutenant de Kersauson. Brillant fought at the Trincomalee between 25 August and 3 September 1782 under Lieutenant de Kersauson. In the night of 12 January 1783, chasing the frigate Fine which she had mistaken for a privateer, HMS Coventry (1757) sailed into Ganjam Roads, where Suffren's H√©ros, Illustre, Ajax and Brillant were at anchor. Captain Wolseley, of Coventry, had no information that French vessels were in the area and so allowed the current to take him towards the vessels, the wind being weak. As Coventry arrived, Suffren, on H√©ros, was sending a boat over to Illustre, but the boat master was drunk and instead mistakenly came aboard Coventry. The boat's crew was promptly taken prisoners and taken to the orlop deck. At this moment, the French division noticed Coventry, and Illustre, Ajax and Brillant opened fire. Interrogating his prisoners, Wolseley learnt that the ships firing on him were part of Suffren's squadron, at which point his men rushed below. Alone on his quarterdeck, Wolseley had no choice but to surrender. Brillant took part in the Battle of Cuddalore on 20 June 1783.  Fate  After returning to France, Brillant was hulked in Cherbourg from 1787. She was struck in 1795, and broken up in 1797.

Hendrik Chabot: Artist beyond Expressionism. If there is any one modern Dutch painter who stands near to Van Gogh, it is, surely, Hendrik Chabot (1894‚Äì1949), whose work, as a critic has written, is hard, awkward, tragic, and... carries the mark of genius.As Dr A.M.W.J.Hammacher, who was director of the Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum near Otterlo and professor of art history at Delft Technological University wrote in Spring 1963, Delta, A Review of Arts Life and Thought in the Netherlands, volume VI / No 1  Life and workMainly based on 'Chabot, leven en werk', 1981 Leo Ott, Rotterdam, .  Henk Chabot was a son of Willem Chabot and Johanna Aantje van den Hoven. As a child he moved with his parents in 1906 to Rotterdam. He followed classes in the evening at the Rotterdam academy of art and science now known as the Willem de Kooning Academie. From 1915 he restored paintings, from 1916 in his own studio at the Zuidblaak, and shortly afterwards at the Wijnstraat. In the early twenties he made trips to Germany and Austria and visited museums among other in Dresden, Munich and Vienna. Soon after he made his first sculptures. He joined the artists Group the Branding (surf) (founded around 1915, abolished in 1926). Several other members were: L. van Kuyk, G. Ladage, T. Gits, B. Canter, J. Tielens, G. Rober, H. Bieling, M. en H. Richters, P. Begeer and Leendert Bolle. In 1927 he married Antonia (To) Tolenaars (1900‚Äì1988). Starting in the thirties painting began to predominate: topics were derived from the Rotterdam town life and port scenery. In 1933 he stayed in Vrouwenpolder in Zeeland, where he met and became friends with Charley Toorop and Bram Hammacher. New topics were: the sea, farmers, cows and horses. Chabot joined the Kring van beeldende kunstenaars R33 (Circle of artists R33) (abolished in 1940). After returning in 1934 from Zeeland he settled along the little peat river in Bergschenhoek near Rotterdam, because Henk and To had grown away from the city life. His works from the pre-Zeeland period stayed stored at the studio at the Wijnstraat, which was taken over by his younger brother and painter Wim Chabot. When Wim in 1936 moved his studio to the Wijnhaven, the stored works of Henk moved along. Due to the German bombardment on May 14, 1940, all this works and those of Wim got lost. In 1937 'De Voetballer' (football player) was disclosed, a big concrete in Stadion Feyenoord. He was also invited to make a painting for the captain's cabin of the Nieuw Amsterdam (1938), flagship of the Holland America Line. For this occasion Chabot specially rented a studio where he made a big landscape. Before World War II he regularly exhibited at Carel van Lier's in his 'Kunstzaal van Lier' at the Rokin in Amsterdam. Chabot was in the last years before the war and a short while after more or less the figurehead of Dutch fine arts. During World War II in 1943 he made a series of paintings with a dark colour palette on the topic get-away: the pinnacle of his work concerning the war. In the years hereafter the colour palette rapidly got more light- coloured, brighter. Chabot died in 1949 in Rotterdam. The Hendrik Chabot Award was named after him. His probably most well known work is the 'Brand van Rotterdam' (Fire of Rotterdam) which he made after he saw from his little cottage at the River Rotte the burning city after the bombardment of Rotterdam by the Germans on May 14, 1940. This painting is owned by the municipality of Rotterdam but in permanent loan at the Chabot Museum.

It is composed of nine or ten slightly convex whorls, united by a shallow suture, and furnished at their upper part with very close small folds or granulations. These folds form a girdle, and crown the whorls, which are again ornamented throughout their whole length with transverse thin ridges, more strongly prominent towards the base. There appear, besides, upon the body whorl, oblique striae of growth pretty apparent, and presenting sometimes the appearance of varices. One or two striae separate also the folds from the upper marginal edge. The aperture is oblong, slightly narrowed, dilated at its base, where it is terminated by a very deep and slightly oblique emargination. The interior of the aperture is of a brown fawn color.

Career and business  In 1997, he founded the Russian Sea LLC (which imports herring and mackerel from Norway) together with his brother. He chose to start from the bottom rung of the corporate ladder in order to penetrate deeply into all aspects of the business, and began working in his own company as a Sales Manager. After the company had achieved successful results, he took a position as sales director and then executive director and CEO. In 2002, he bought out the company shares from his brother and became the company's majority owner. With Vorobyov at the helm, the Russian Sea LLC has become one of the largest Russian processors of fish and suppliers of fish products and has demonstrated fast growth. The company built its own factory for fish processing (1999) and developed its own federal distribution chain. In addition, the company started developing an aquacultural business (2007) and fish harvesting (2011). The company completed IPO at MICEX (2010) and became the first public Russian company in its sector. The Russian Sea company brand was named the best known in its sector in 2007 (TNS Gallup Media, III quarter of 2007), as well as in 2011 (TNS Gallup Media; OMI ). In 2013, the brand ‚ÄúRussian Sea‚Äù was sold together with the factory, and the company focused on the aquacultural division (Russian Aquaculture PJSC) and fish harvesting (Russian Fishery Company LLC).

The film is inspired by the eponymous 1969 film, which was directed by B. R. Chopra. It stars Sidharth Malhotra, Akshaye Khanna and Sonakshi Sinha. The film has a Rashomon effect storytelling. The film was released on 3 November 2017.  Plot  Vikram (Sidharth Malhotra) is an acclaimed British writer of Indian descent. On the launch of his third book in Mumbai, he finds his publisher wife Katherine dead in their hotel room. The police suspect him so he flees by car. As the cops give chase, his car overturns and he escapes with injuries, taking shelter in a nearby apartment. Maya (Sonakshi Sinha), a young housewife who lives there, spots a police car outside and rushes there for help. The police find Vikram next to the body of her lawyer husband, Shekhar, who has been murdered. They also find burnt photographs in the trash. Dev Verma (Akshaye Khanna), an officer investigating the double murder, interrogates Vikram and Maya. According to Vikram's account, he fled from the police because he feared he would be framed for his wife's murder. He found Maya at her door and asked for help. He added that his wife did not attend the book launch, as she was unwell and took medicines for a heart ailment. Vikram entered Maya's flat and said that she attempted to seduce him. Maya introduced Chirag, who entered her house saying he was her husband. When Vikram saw a wallpaper photo on her PC and realized Chirag was not Maya's husband, Chirag struck him with a candle- holder and Vikram lost consciousness. Upon waking, he found Shekhar's body next to him. While in custody Vikram was shown removing his shoe as if his foot is sore or shoe is pinching him. According to Maya's account, she found an injured Vikram at her door, asking for help. She let him in only to find out from the news that the police are looking for him for the murder of his wife. Vikram whipped out a knife and overpowered her, and began searching for documents at Shekhar's desk when she turned a visiting Chirag away, with whom she confessed of having an extramarital affair. Around midnight, her husband returned and struggled to free her from Vikram. Maya rushed outside to a police vehicle for help. By the time she returned, Vikram had killed her husband with a candle-holder. Meanwhile, the police find that a gang rape victim named Sandhya committed suicide recently because Vikram had written his third book about that incident and, hoping to prevent his third book from being a failure, he had leaked her identity to generate buzz. Examination of Katherine's body reveals that she had died of a heart attack. The forensic team informs Dev that Shekhar was attacked on the head by someone who was at least 6 feet tall. The police initially suspect Vikram as his height is 6‚Äô1\\". However, it is found that the burnt photographs were those of Maya and Chirag, who is also about 6 feet tall. The photographs had been taken by a detective hired by Shekhar. The police eventually conclude that Vikram's account is true and Maya and Chirag had killed Shekhar when he confronted them with the photos. Moreover, there was no mud on Shekhar's shoes at the time of his death. It had rained at 11 pm and there was mud on the streets. Vikram had stated that Shekhar had come home at 7:30, hence his account was believed to be true whereas Maya's account of her husband returning home at 12 am was labelled false as a result. Vikram is deemed innocent and released from custody. He cremates his wife's body, and Maya and Chirag are arrested and charged with Shekhar's murder. At home, Dev is reading Vikram's second book when his wife Meera (Mandira Bedi) spoils that the protagonist dies of drug overdose. Dev rushes to the forensic doctor to check if Vikram's wife could have died from an overdose of the medicine she had been taking for her heart. They discover that the capsules had been tampered with and the dose was made three times higher than normal, which caused Katherine to have a fatal heart attack. Dev calls Vikram while the latter is about to catch a flight back to London. On the phone, Vikram confesses to having killed Katherine and Shekhar. He killed Katherine because she was threatening to charge him for the suicide of Sandhya. Shekhar was the lawyer working with her to file a case against him. He fled to Shekhar's house to destroy the legal documents of the case. When Maya went out to seek help, he killed her husband and stumbled across the photographs with her lover. He partially burnt them and threw them in the trash, banking on the conviction that the police would find the ominously burnt, adulterous pictures, creating a convincing story to dupe the police, which would then insinuate the inquisitory suspicion that it was Maya, in conjunction with Chirag who had orchestrated the murder of her husband Shekhar in order to conceal her affair. He also switched Shekar's muddy shoes with his own. He tells Dev that he has already cremated his wife's body; thus there is no evidence left. Dev decides to catch Vikram and punish him even if he has to take an illegal action to do so. However, Vikram leaves for London on his flight as Dev watches helplessly.

Co-produced by Red Chillies Entertainment, BR Studios & Dharma Productions, Ittefaq released on 3 November. Ittefaq is an adaptation of a film with the same name, produced by BR Chopra under his BR Films banner & directed by Yash Chopra.

The film is directed by Abhay Chopra, grand son of BR Chopra, the producer of the original film. The makers of the film decided that movie will NOT be promoted at any platform. But before the release they came out with a campaign on Digital Media, requesting viewers not to disclose the culprit after watching movie. = Casting = The makers of the film chose Sidharth Malhotra and Sonakshi Sinha to star in the film as lead roles. Rajkummar Rao was cast to play a doctor but he then opted out. = Filming = The principal photography of the film started in February 2017. The film was shot entirely in Mumbai. = Promotion = Rather than using traditional and costly marketing techniques (reality show promotion, media interviews and city tours), the producers decided to focus on television, radio and print advertising.  Release  = Critical response = On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on nine reviews, with an average rating of 5.92/10. India Today reviewed \\"Sidharth-Sonakshi's murder mystery will keep you on your toes\\". The Indian Express stated the movie as \\"a smart, gripping whodunit\\". Deccan Chronicle called the movie \\"A crackling whodunnit\\". = Box office = The film, which was released on 1100 screens throughout India, had a moderate opening of 40 million. Ittefaq was in competition with Golmaal Again, which released in Diwali, has been in strong position even after the third week. Hollywood's Thor: Ragnarok of the popular Marvel Cinematic Universe, which recorded strong opening collection, was released concurrently with the film thus affecting its business. Despite the tough competition, Ittefaq has been able to earn as much as ‚Çπ40 million by fighting against Golmaal Again and Thor: Ragnarok. *1st Day ‚Çπ40 million (India) *2nd Day ‚Çπ50.6 million (India) *3rd Day ‚Çπ60.5 million (India)  Soundtrack  The song Ittefaq Se was recreated by Bagchi from the song Raat Baaki Baat Baaki from the film Namak Halal, originally composed by Bappi Lahiri and sung by Asha Bhosle , Shashi Kapoor and Lahiri.

Built in 1914 on a site with nearly 100 years of industrial use, it was (as of its 1979 listing on the National Register of Historic Places) a well-preserved and functional period water-powered grist mill and sawmill. The mill building was demolished in 2017. Description and history The Dinsmore Mill was located just west of the village center of Palermo, Maine, across the town line in China. It was set astride the West Branch Sheepscot River, which drains Branch Pond to the north and is impounded by the dam located beneath the mill structure. The mill was a 2-1/2 story frame structure, rectangular in shape, covered by a gabled roof and wooden shingle siding. A three-story tower rose near the center of the southern (street-facing) facade; it was also capped by a gabled roof. The ground floor of the building housed the main works, which included a water- driven turbine and the milling equipment. A conveyor belt provided access to the upper floor, which was historically used for the storage of grain. The first documented mill at this site was in operation in 1817, owned by Joseph Hacker. It was later taken over by Hacker's son-in-law, who partnered in 1879 with his son-in-law, Thomas Dinsmore. Dinsmore passed the mill on to his son, James R.B. Dinsmore. He is responsible for construction of this building, after the older one was destroyed by fire (along with adjacent houses) in 1908. At first just a grist mill, it was expanded in 1935 by James Kenneth Dinsmore to again also function as a sawmill. The mill operated until 1960. The mill was in the 2010s a source of some local controversy. The main building had deteriorated, and the dam underneath was unable to support the consistently high levels of water desired by the owners of waterfront on Branch Pond and mandated by the state's Department of Environmental Protection. In 2016, the owners reached an impasse with local and state authorities, as they claimed to be unable to lower the water levels sufficiently to effect needed repairs on the dam. They claimed that structural instability due to the building's deteriorated condition would make such repair work difficult and potentially dangerous. The property was acquired in 2017 by the Atlantic Salmon Federation, which subsequently demolished the mill and altered the dam to support the passage of anadromous fish.

It was first written down by in 1890 and included in his German book, About the Travelling Gypsy People: Scenes of the Life of the Transylvanian Gypsies.Heinrich von Wlislocki: Die Erschaffung der Geige\\" in Vom wandernden Zigeunervolke. Bilder aus dem Leben der Siebenb√ºrger Zigeuner. Geschichtliches, Ethnologisches, Sprache und Poesie. Richter, Hamburg 1890, p. 221 f  Story  A poor couple wishes in vain to have a child, and the wife complains about her misery to an old woman she meets in a forest. The hag sends her home with the instruction, \\"Go home and cut open a pumpkin, pour milk into it and drink it. You will then give birth to a boy who will be happy and rich!\\" Although the wife follows her advice and gives birth to a beautiful baby boy, she falls ill and dies shortly afterward. When the boy is twenty years old, he travels the world to seek his fortune. He comes to a big city, where a rich king rules. The king has a wonderful daughter, whom he will give in marriage to a man who can do something which no one in the world has done before. Many men try their luck and fail, paying for their failures with their lives. When the naive boy asks the king what he should do, he is thrown into a dark dungeon. Matuya, the fairy queen, appears to him in a bright light and gives him a box and a rod; she tells him that he should pluck some hairs from her head and string them over the box and the rod. Then he should bow the hairs of the box with the hairs of the rod, playing the violin to make people happy or sad as Matuya laughs and cries into the instrument. The boy demonstrates his artistic skill to the king, who is overjoyed and gives him his beautiful daughter as his wife. The tale ends with, \\"This is how the violin came to the world\\".  Origin, comparison and distribution  The tale has folkloric origins and magical content; common in fairy tales, the old hag and the good fairy both possess magical powers. The good fairy, Matuya, is based on magic tales of the Hindu tradition (common in Roma tales). Matuya appears in Transylvanian, Hungarian, Polish, Russian and Serbian Roma mythology as queen of the Ursitory. These fairies, typically beautiful women who live in mountainside palaces, enjoy singing and dancing and symbolise music.Hermann Berger: Mythologie der Zigeuner.

A telling close to this version of folktale by Polish writer Jerzy Ficowski entitled Zaczarowana skrzynka (English: \\"The Magic Box\\") occurs in his collection Ga≈ÇƒÖzka z drzewa s≈Ço≈Ñca (1961). The English translation appeared in the anthology Sister of The Birds and Other Gypsy Tales (1976). In this Polish version, the helpful spirit is a beech tree spirit named Matuja, who also prescribes milk drunk out of the hollow of a pumpkin to cure infertility, and the boy then born is named \\"Bachtalo\\". Another Roma tale with the same name (also published by Wlislocki) is lesser-known, probably because it is confusing and lacks a happy ending. A young women contacts the devil because she admires a rich hunter who ignores her. She sacrifices her family for the devil's violin to attract the hunter; her father becomes its body, her four brothers become the strings and her mother becomes the bow. In the end, the young woman is carried off by the devil when she refuses to worship him; the violin remains in the forest until it is found and taken by a travelling gypsy.Heinrich von Wlislocki: \\"Die Erschaffung der Geige\\" in Vom wandernden Zigeunervolke.

Richter, Hamburg 1890, p. 218 f .Francis Hindes Groome (ed. trans.): The Creation of the Violin in Gypsy Folk Tales, Hurst and Blackett, London, 1899 In both tales, the violinist makes his audience laugh and cry. Creation tales are typical of mythology, and this is one of the few fairy tales which describe the creation of a musical instrument. Others are the Hungarian fairy tale, \\"The Violin\\", and the story of the Mongolian morin khuur. Both differ significantly from the Transylvanian tale. In Greek mythology, the creation of the pan flute by Pan and Syrinx is a well-known example.Rosemarie T√ºpker: Musik im M√§rchen. Reichert Verlag Wiesbaden 2011, p. 65, p. 69 ff, p. 73 f .  Interpretation  Rosemarie T√ºpker interpreted the fairy tale in a hermeneutical analysis of modern audiences. In addition to requesting reflections on the full story, T√ºpker sought comments on specific topics: poverty and childlessness, a rich king with a beautiful daughter and the achievement of the unprecedented.Liste der Einzelmotive und M√§rchentext, downloaded on 1 March 2016. The tale explores the polarity between two worlds, characterised by poverty and wealth. The rich king possesses his daughter like a belonging and wants to give her away as a prize, without considering her feelings. The story is about avarice, success and failure and making decisions, exemplified by the competition. Only the old hag and Matuya, the fairy, can help achieve what is otherwise impossible. The other world is symbolised by the violin, used here as a prototype for all music. This is a world of emotion and the evocation of emotion in others. The demonstration of something unprecedented combines visual and aural perceptions. \\"The Creation of the Violin\\" can also be interpreted as a combination of the male and the female in a world without desire. Psychoanalytically, it involves generativity and triangulation. From the male and the female, a third object is produced: music, which evokes joy or sorrow. The power of a musician (who evokes feelings) is quite different from the power of a king, who rules by force. It has been noted that neither the son of the poor woman nor the daughter of the king were from intact families. The infant boy's father is not mentioned as a father, and the mother of the king's daughter is not mentioned at all.Rosemarie T√ºpker: Musik im M√§rchen. Reichert Verlag Wiesbaden 2011, p. 51 and 53‚Äì57 The violin expresses the duality of laughter and tears, joy and sorrow and love and death. The violin was seen as a very emotional instrument. However, in reality, contrary to the fairy tale, it takes years of practice, to express emotion with the instrument and evoke emotion in listeners.

A breeding pair is formed in a courtship display. This courtship includes undulating displays by both in the pair, with the male bird picking up a piece of rock and dropping it only to enter into a steep dive and catch it in mid-air, repeating the maneuver 3 or more times. The female takes a clump of earth and drops and catches it in the same fashion. Small sticks may also be used in this display. Compared to the bald eagle, golden eagles do not repeat courtship displays annually (which is believed to strengthen pair bonds) and rarely engage in talon-locking downward spirals.Cornell University. Bna.birds.cornell.edu. Retrieved on 2012‚Äì08‚Äì22. Golden eagles typically build several eyries within their territory and use them alternately for several years. Their nesting areas are characterized by the extreme regularity of the nest spacing. In 9 studies of annual nest spacing, the average minimum distance between nests range from apart in Norway to apart in Switzerland.Bergo, G. 1984. Population size, spacing and age structure of Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos (L.) in Handaland, West Norway. Fauna Norvegica, Series C, Cindus: 7: 106‚Äì108. Nests in Scotland may found at anywhere from 10 to 65 pairs per , with an average of over 20 pairs found per area. In much of continental Europe, densities of less than 10 pairs per are typical. In the United States different areas had from 10 to more than 20 pairs on average per . Wyoming had the greatest densities of breeding golden eagles of any complied study, though numbers were comparable to western Scotland as there were an average of just over 20 pairs per , with greatest estimated densities of possibly 125 per area. In Wyoming, the distance between nests ranged from , averaging . In the wooded peatlands of Sweden and Belarus, a maximum of 5 pairs appear to occur per . In Quebec, the distance between nests ranged from . In the Snake River canyon in Idaho, nests are apart, while two other nearby studies in Idaho found the average distance were and , respectively. The nesting density for a breeding population near Livermore, California, and the Altamont Pass Wind Farm is among the highest in the world for golden eagles, with at least 44 pairs in 1997, a density of one pair per . Due to the consistency of use by golden eagle pairs, population densities change generally happens only quite gradually.  Nest requirements  The cliff nest of a golden eagle Golden eagles seem to prefer to build their nests on cliffs where they are available. Nests are generally located at around half of the maximum elevation of the surrounding land. This height preference may be related to having the ability to transport heavy prey downhill rather than uphill. A massive benefit to cliff nests is that they tend to be largely or entirely inaccessible to mammalian predators on foot (including humans). In Spain, studies revealed the preferred sites of golden eagle nests were on inaccessible cliffs at a great distance from tracks, roads and villages. 95.6% of 410 nests built in Scotland were on cliffs. Similarly, in Bulgaria, Italy, Switzerland, France and Yugoslavia, more than 90% of golden eagles nests were located on cliffs.Mathieu, R. & Choisy, J.P.

Christopher Helm Ltd., A & C Black, London. Rural, arid areas of Europe such as the Iberian peninsula, Provence in France and the Apennines in Italy, fire combined with pastoral activity has maintained suitable nesting sites at relatively low elevations. In the Spanish Pyrenees, however, nest were found at up to in elevation. 80% of nests in Spain are on rocky cliffs, the remaining 20% being in trees. Rocky, low mountainous areas are used for nesting in Israel. All known nests in Iraq have been on cliffs. In Norway, the mean elevation of nests was . Throughout the Baltic States and eastern Fennoscandia, golden eagles inhabit relatively flat wooded peatlands and, here, the local golden eagles generally nest in trees. Tree nests are known to be used exclusively in Estonia and Belarus. On the island of Gotland in Sweden, the trees holding nests had an average trunk diameter of more than and an average height of with the nest being located at an average of above the ground. Cliff nests are preferred as nesting sites in most of North America.Baglien, J. W. 1975. Biology and habitat requirements of the nesting Golden Eagle in southwestern Montana. Master's Thesis. Montana State University, Bozeman. In Northern California, tree nests were apparently mainly used.Hunt, W. G., Jackman, R.E. Brown, T. L., Gilardi, J. G., Driscoll, D. E. & Culp, L. 1995. A pilot Golden Eagle population study in the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area, California. Predatory Bird Research Group, University of California, Santa Cruz. In the forested landscape of western Washington, where large clear cut areas having provided suitable hunting habitat, golden eagles almost exclusively nest in Douglas firs (Pseudotsuga menziesii) at forest edge. There, the nest-hosting tree were with the nest being located at a height of . In a study of 170 eyries in the state of Wyoming, 111 were on deciduous trees, 36 in ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa) and 23 on sides of buttes or bluffs along river. Cottonwood and willow trees dominated the trees selected, averaging in diameter and in height. In Wyoming, the tree nests are often the tallest tree in a stand and are in a small or isolated woodlot less than away from large clearcuts or fields. Ground nest are rare in Scotland but not uncommon in the United States, especially in arid areas of states such as Nevada, North Dakota and Wyoming. Ground nests typically occur on lofty hills which have little ground vegetation and require adults to have a good protective all-around view.Seibert, D. J., R. J. Oakleaf, J. M. Laughlin, and J. L.

U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish & Wildlife Service, Washington, D.C. abandoned gold dredges and electrical transmission towers. Both heavy rain and excessive heat can potentially kill nestlings, so golden eagles often place their nests to suit the local climate. In northern areas, such as Alaska, sun exposure (southern orientation) may help nesting success, while those nesting in hot, lowland Utah and arid regions of Israel were mainly northerly facing to keep the nest out of the hot glare of the sun.Bahat, O. (1989). Aspects in the ecology and biodynamics of the Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos homeyeri) in the arid regions of Israel. Master's Thesis. Tel Aviv Univ. Tel Aviv, Israel. Almost all established breeding golden eagles build more than one nest. A typical range of nests per pair is between 2 and 5. In Sweden, pairs on average built 2.4 of them. There is an average of about 4.5 nests per pair in Scotland. In Idaho, there was an average of 6 nests per pair. In more exceptional cases, up to 13 nests have built by a single pair in Scotland and up to 12 by a single pair in Idaho. Some pairs utilize alternate nest sites every year, others apparently rarely use alternate nests. Some golden eagle pairs may not use a nest for up to six years after its construction. Golden eagle nests usually consist of heavy tree branches, upholstered with grass when in use. As is typical of a large accipitrid, the nests of golden eagles are very large. However, they are smaller on average than bald eagle nests. In Kazakhstan, golden eagle nests were similar in size to white-tailed eagle nests. In the Isle of Mull in Scotland, however, white-tailed eagle nests were slightly larger as they used thicker, larger sticks lined with grass that make a more massive nest than the isle's golden eagle nests, which used thinner sticks or heather and lined their nest with woodrush. In Arizona, golden eagle nests averaged in length (ranging from ), in width (range of ), and in height (range of ). The sticks used in the Arizona nests ranged up to a length of , a diameter of and a weight of . Nests in Scotland average in length, in width and in depth. In Washington state, tree nests averaged in depth and in diameter. Nests in Sweden averaged in length, in width and in depth. Nests in Kazakhstan averaged in length, in diameter and in depth. The nest of the golden eagle may weigh well over .Kulves, H. Havornens Haliaeetus albicilla albicilla L ekogi pa Aland. Skrifer utgiuna av Alands Kultus tense Lnr 9. As the eagles use a nest repeatedly, they repair their nests whenever necessary and enlarge them during each use. If the eyrie is situated on a tree, supporting tree branches may break because of the weight of the nest. The largest known golden eagle nest, located on a steep river butte along Sun River in Montana, was deep and in width. Certain other animals‚Äîtoo small to be of interest to the huge raptor‚Äîsometimes use the nest as shelter or even as a nest for themselves, for the incidental protection offered. This has mainly been associated with Eurasian wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) in Europe, though has also been recorded remarkably with ring ouzels (Turdus torquatus) and pine martens, both of which have been recorded as prey for golden eagles elsewhere in Europe. In a similar situation, little curlews in northeastern Siberia apparently gain some protection from predators by nesting close to golden eagle eyries. In each case, the natural predators of these animals are just the right size for golden eagle prey, and therefore avoid active eyries. Related species such as eastern imperial and Bonelli‚Äôs eagles have been observed to nest in abandoned golden eagle nests, as well as distantly related or unrelated raptors including white-tailed eagles, lammergeiers, gyrfalcons and peregrine falcons.Ratcliffe, D.A. (1990). Bird life of mountains and upland. University Press, Cambridge.  Mating and egg-laying  Egg, Collection Museum Wiesbaden Mating and egg-laying timing for golden eagle is variable depending on the locality. Copulation normally lasts 10‚Äì20 seconds. Mating seems to occur around 40‚Äì46 days before the initial egg-laying. Unusual mating systems of three birds have been recorded in Scotland and Sweden, usually the third being an immature of either sex. These may simply reflect a relatively unstable period of population adjustment. Occasionally, pairs have been recorded copulating outside of the context of fertilization, possibly for pair maintenance and displacement activity. In Japan, a pair was seen mating 46 days before egg laying and in the United States 55 days after egg-laying. The date of egg laying has been directly correlated by the latitude where the pair lives. In the U.S., egg laying can be from anywhere between January and September, though is usually in March or later. In Scotland, egg-laying occurs in March to mid-April. The earliest median laying date in 25 international studies was December 3 in Oman; the latest median date of egg-laying was May 7 in sub-Arctic Alaska. Egg laying starts in the dry season as early as late November around Mali and Niger while the median egg laying date in southwestern Morocco is January 15.Heim de Balzac, H. & Maynaud, N. (1962). Les Oiseaux du Nord-Ouest de l‚ÄôAfrique. Lechevalier, Paris. In Ethiopia, the estimated range of egg-laying dates ranged from October 24 to January 5. The median egg laying day in Arctic Russia was May 1.Dementiev, G.P. & Gladkov, N.A. (1966). Birds of the Soviet Union, Vol. 1. Israel Programme of Scientific Translations, Jerusalem. In the Kilbuck and Ahklun Mountains area, three pairs had eggs hatched from May 14 to 23, and young fledged from July 8 to August 10 with a median date of July 23 for 11 nests. Two nests on the Kisaralik River still contained young on July 24, and four nests contained young from 16 to 21 July. Clutches have been recorded range in size from 1 to 4 eggs, though two is the norm around the range. Records of single egg clutches are fairly common in Europe, with 3 being rare there but seemingly more common in North America, where up to 12% of clutches include 3 eggs. A 4 egg clutch is considered exceptional. The lowest mean clutch size known from surveys is 1.82 eggs in the Altai Mountains of Russia.Irisov, E.A. & Irisov, N.L. 1998. On distribution and biology of Golden Eagle in Altai. Modern Ornithology. Moscow, pp. 139‚Äì156. A mean of 48 clutches from Algeria and Tunisia showed an average of 1.89 eggs per nests, with a range of 1 to 3. The female laid an average number of eggs of 1.99 in 332 clutches from 8 studies in 5 of the Western United States. The largest mean clutch size across the range was 2.1 in Montana. In the wild, eggs are typically laid at 3 to 5 day intervals, with records in captivity of intervals of up to 7 or 10 days.Gordon, S. (1955). The Golden Eagle; king of birds. 1st Am. ed. Citadel Press, New York. The eggs vary from all white to white with cinnamon or brown spots and blotches. Scottish eggs averaged in size and weigh about . In Armenia, the average egg measured and weighed . In North America, eggs average , with a range of lengths from and a range of width of . Eggs of golden eagles in California weighed from , averaging . The incubation period lasts from 41 to 45 days, averaging about 42.4 days, with previously reported claims of as low as 33 days from North America now known to be erroneous. Females do a majority of, but not all, of the incubating and largely attain their own food up to the stage of egg-laying, after which they are typically fed by the male. The female may continue to grab most of their own food in areas where carrion is easily accessible. If made to forage excessively during the incubation stage by a non-attentive mate, the female may abandon the nesting attempt. In Idaho, the female did 84% of the incubation during the day, with the male doing about 16%. At night, the female generally appears to do all of the incubating. In Japan, the female did 90% of the observed incubating.  Early life  A few day-old golden eagle nestling with its unhatched sibling's egg The golden eagle chick may be heard from within the egg 15 hours before it begins hatching. After the first chip is broken off of the egg, there is no activity for around 27 hours. After this period, the hatching activity accelerates and the shell is broken apart in 35 hours. The chick is completely free in 37 hours. Upon hatching, the chicks are covered in fluffy white down. One day after hatching, chicks will weigh , with an average of . In the first 10 days, chicks mainly lie down on the nest substrate. The eagles are capable of preening on their second day but are continually thermoregulated via brooding by their parents until around 20 days. Within 10 days, the hatchlings grow considerably, weighing around . Around this age, they also start sitting up more. Around 20 days of age, the chicks generally start standing, which becomes the main position over the course of the next 40 days. The whitish down continues until around 25 days of age, at which point it is gradually replaced by dark contour feathers that eclipse the down and the birds attain a general piebald appearance. After hatching, 80% of food items and 90% of food biomass is captured and brought to the nest by the adult male. The adult male golden eagle perch away from the nest for about 74% of the nestling period, whereas females mainly stay on the nest for about 45 days after the first chick hatches. The voice of nestlings advances from a soft chirp to a disyllabic seeir at around 15 days of age and then to a louder, clearer and conspicuously harsher psaa call given from about 20 days of age to as late as several weeks after fledging. From 10 days to 45 days of age, the nestlings eat much more food and grow considerably. Meal size increases throughout the nesting season, the estimated morsel of flesh fed to the young ranged from at hatching to at fledging. The nestling golden eagles start ‚Äúmantling‚Äù over food at around 10‚Äì20 days old: when given a food object, they stand over it, wings partially open, tail fanned and head bowed, covering the food item completely. This is believed to be a competitive behavior as it is seen only in nests with more than one chick. Within a matter of days, the chicks try to defecate over the edge of the nest but are not competent at it until they are around 20 days old. The average daily food consumption for female nestlings tends to be greater than those in male nestlings. The average food consumption of the nestling sexes averages and per day, respectively, with male nestlings weighing about less than the equivalent-aged females. Despite this, males typically tend to develop sooner and fledge more quickly than the females.Newton, I. (1979). Population Ecology of Raptors. Poyser, Berkhamsted. The average amount of food brought to the nest daily was notably higher in Idaho and Montana, where an average of and of prey were brought to the nest, respectively, than in Texas, where an average of was brought.Lockhart, J.M. (1976). The food habits, status and ecology of nesting Golden Eagles in the Trans-Pecos region of Texas. Masters of Science thesis. Ross State University, Alpine, Texas. For the first 30 days or so, the nestlings are fully dependent on their parents to feed them but after that period, they start standing around the edge of the nest and practice food tearing. When the first chick is an average of 29 days old, the female first start perching off the nest and at 40 days of age, she stops perching on the nest platform. From 50 days onward, dark brown plumage sprouts from the same sockets as the down and plumage changes become more subtle. The feet go from flesh-colored at hatching to grey to black, thence finally to yellow. When they are around 20 days or so old, as the structure of their wing develops, the nestlings start wing flapping and the frequency and intensity of this behavior increases considerably by 40 days old. Fledging occurs at 66 to 75 days of age in Idaho and 70 to 81 days in Scotland.  Cainism  ‚ÄúCainism‚Äù, as it is sometimes called, or siblicide is inarguably the most controversial and confusing aspect of the golden eagles‚Äô reproductive biology. This is the habitual behavior in the nest of the oldest hatchling to attack and usually kill their young siblings. In fact, this behavior is quite common, not only in large accipitirids but also in unrelated raptorial birds such as skuas and owls. Cainism is frequent, even typical in species of the genus Aquila. The traditionally classified genus can be broken down into two groups: facultative cainists (wherein fewer than 90% of known nests do the oldest nestling attack and kill their younger siblings) and obligate cainists (wherein more than 90% of nests do the older kill the younger siblings). The golden eagle is part of the facultative cainists group, along with the wedge-tailed, eastern imperial, steppe and greater spotted eagles. The obligate cainists are two tropical species, the Verreaux's and the tawny eagle, and one temperate-climate-dwelling species, the lesser spotted- eagle. Other Aquila eagles seem to roughly fall into the tropical species being obligate cainists vs temperate species being facultative cainists categories. Sometimes called ‚Äúbiologically wasteful‚Äù, this strategy is most commonly explained as useful for the species because it makes the parents' workload manageable even when food is scarce, while providing a reserve chick in case the first-born dies soon after hatching. Golden eagles invest much time and effort in bringing up their young; once able to hunt on their own, most golden eagles survive many years, but mortality even among first-born nestlings is much higher, in particular in the first weeks after hatching. This theory is borne out by the fact that the tropical species which are obligate cainists invariably have a longer average nesting period than species which nest in temperate zones. In southwestern Idaho, sibling aggression occurred in all nests with 2-chick broods observed from blinds, and resulted in 1 death in 3 (43%) of 7 broods. In another study, siblicide accounted for 7% of 41 nestling mortalities in southwestern Idaho. 6 (40%) of 15 nestling losses in nests in Central Europe were from cainism.Kropil, R. and M. Majda. (1996). \\"Causes of low productivity in the Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos in the central West Carpathians\\", pp. 489‚Äì494 in Eagle studies. (Meyburg, B. U. and R. D. Chancellor, Eds.) World Working Group on Birds of Prey and Owls, Berlin, Germany. In Scotland, there may be a weak link between food supply and cainism. On Skye, where carrion and rabbits are quite abundant, the younger sibling survives to fledge in about 20% of nests, whereas in the West-Central Highlands, where food is more scarce, the second sibling fledged in only about 4% of nests. However, many nest where food availability was seemingly much higher than what all nestlings would need for food still experience siblicide. The nestlings hatch in approximate 3- to 5-day intervals. If it is a three-egg clutch, the mean estimated weight of the three hatchlings at the time the final egg hatches is , and , making the largest chick easily dominant and giving the youngest practically no chance of survival. The oldest golden eagle hatchling may start acting aggressively to its younger sibling(s) as soon as it or they hatch. Within the first two days, this often escalates into ‚Äúbill- stabbing‚Äù wherein the younger sibling is jabbed around their neck or the middle of their body until a gaping, fatal wound is created. If it is not directly killed, the younger sibling may starve to death, which may be an even more common occurrence. It is apparently common for the younger, weaker siblings to stop begging for food after sibling aggression starts and the parent eagles do not feed the nestlings unless they beg. In some cases, the young nestlings are physically forced from the nest entirely by their older sibling. It is possible that cainism is more common when the older hatchling happens to be a female but, in many cases of males hatching first, they are still larger than the younger siblings and often do dominate and kill them whether male or female. In one nest in Idaho and one in Montana, the oldest sibling was reported to eat their younger siblings, the only verified instances of cannibalism in golden eagles. Although the brooding mothers, otherwise famous for the high level of their parental care, is fully aware of the sibling aggression, in no raptorial bird species are they known to intervene when cainism occurs. After the young are about 20 days old, the amount of aggression between siblings (if both survive) decreases and both chicks can usually fledge, though aggression may again increase shortly before fledging.  Fledging and ensuing years  The first attempted flight departure can be abrupt, with the young jumping off and using a series of short, stiff wing-beats to glide downward or being blown out of nest while wing-flapping. The initial flight often includes a short flight on unsteady wings followed by an uncontrolled landing. Young eagles stay within of the nest in the first few weeks after fledging. They typically have a favored perch where food is brought by the parents and the fledglings only rarely need to take to the wing. 18 to 20 days after first fledging, the young eagles will take their first circling flight but they cannot gain height as efficiently as their parents until approximately 60 days after fledging. Around the time they are 4 months old, the juveniles start to shun the parents attention, even if offered shelter from rain. In Cumbria, young golden eagles were first seen hunting large prey 59 days after fledging and 75 to 85 days after fledging the young were largely independent of parents. In Israel, at 60‚Äì70 days old after fledging, the juveniles were still close to nest and quite dependent on parents for food. At the next stage, at around 120 days old, the Israeli juvenile eagles hunting attempts increased and at 160‚Äì180 days old they moved further and further away from the nests. The juveniles in Israel first settled over away from the nests. From their first winter until their fourth or fifth winter is the least well-known of the golden eagle‚Äôs life. Juveniles disperse widely during their first year, with males remaining closer to the natal area than the more highly exploratory females.Soutillo et al. 2006 In North Dakota, radio-tagged juvenile golden eagles stayed within of the nest for the first 100 days after fledging but then dispersed over in the following 40 days. The study in North Dakota focused on juveniles from six different nests which successfully produced two fledglings and the behavior of the sibling-pairs was surprisingly gregarious as they flew together, perched together and mutually preened for months after independence. In the juvenile stage, most Idaho non- breeders stayed within of their place of hatching, although some birds distributed more than away from their natal range. The movements of first-year eagles from Denali National Park averaged more than , with surviving individuals migrating south to western Canada and the Western U.S. in autumn then moving back north to western Yukon and Alaska in spring. In Switzerland, juvenile birds traveled an accumulated range of whereas the adults never left their home ranges of . A radio-tagged juvenile in Spain travelled a range of more than in its first three years of independence, then ultimately settled in a vacant territory from its hatching place. There is a handful of records of pairs of sub-adult golden eagles (based on their plumage) nesting, sometimes even successfully producing fledglings. The first attempt of nesting by six banded golden eagles in southwestern Idaho occurred when they were from four to seven years of age, with five years appearing to be the average internationally. Once they attempt to nest for the first time, golden eagles will often return to the vicinity of the natal zone, regularly within of their original nest site, sometimes attacking and even killing older golden eagles pairs if they occupy the area.  Reproductive success  Golden eagle ‚Äì nest scene reconstitution Generally breeding success seems to be greatest where prey is available in abundance. In Central Utah, 57% of eggs successfully hatched out of 87 eggs from 44 clutches. In Idaho, 65% of 282 eggs from 145 clutches successfully hatched, and in Montana, 86% of 28 eggs from 14 clutches hatched.Reynolds III, H. V. (1969). Population status of the Golden Eagle in south-central Montana. Master's Thesis. University of Montana, Missoula. In Scotland, the highest breeding success of golden eagles was in the Eastern Highlands where heather moorland still abundant, bearing plentiful red grouse and mountain hare. The jackrabbit follows a 10-year cycle where it peaks and crashes. In Idaho, 100% of observed nests produced at least one fledgling when the jackrabbits peaked in the late 1970s through the early 1980s and then at the low point in the mid to late 1980s, the nests produced on average only 0.2 fledglings. Similarly, in central Utah jackrabbit numbers were correlated with average number of young reared by 16 golden eagle pairs. Here the average number of young ranged from 0.56 in 1967 to 1.06 in 1969 to 0.31 in 1973. In Sweden, nesting success rose noticeably in years where the hunting bag (estimated quantity of prey) rose. After viral hemorrhagic pneumonia (VHP) killed off many rabbits in Spain, the average breeding success of golden eagles in Northern Spain dropped from 0.77 in 1982‚Äì1989 to 0.38 by 1990‚Äì1992. In Belarus, the average brood size is reportedly 1.8 whereas the average number of fledglings is 1.1.Ivanovski, V.V. (1990). Breeding ecology of the Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) in northern Belarus. Soobshcheniya Pribaltiiskoi Komissii po Izucheniyu Migratsii Ptits Akademiya Nauk Estonskoi SSR 22:130‚Äì154. As previously mentioned, adverse weather can affect breeding success. In the exceptionally stormy and cold spring of 1984 in Montana, 71% (10 out of 14) studied nests failed.Phillips, R.L., Wheeler, A.H., Forrester, N.C., Lockhart, J.M. & McEneaney, T.P. (1990). Nesting ecology of Golden Eagles and other raptors in southeastern Montana and northern Wyoming. Fish and Wildlife Technical Report No. 2. WSDI, Washington. A long period of exceptionally rainy, cold springs in Scotland reportedly resulted in a 25% reduction of fledging pairs being produced. Rather than directly killing the nestlings, stormy, wet weather probably causes the most harm to productivity due to the hampering of the parents' ability to hunt.Haworth, P.R., Fielding, A.K., Whitfield, D.P. & Reid, R. (2009). Diet and breeding success in Golden Eagles: implications for land management. Report by Haworth Conservation to Scottish Natural Heritage. In arid areas, heavier rainfall has the opposite effect and actually improves nesting success. Rainy years in the deserts of Israel, which provide more brown hares and chukars to hunt, were more successful years for breeding. While siblicide is estimated to claim about 80% of second hatchlings among golden eagles, in some parts of the range, the survival rate in successful nests is higher. In ideal habitats in North America (Northwestern United States and Alaska), 38 to 56% of nests produce a second fledging. Populations at northern end of range have smaller broods (brood size being about 12% smaller) and produce fewer fledglings (population productivity being about 25% smaller) than those in temperate areas, as has been revealed by contrasting studies of Alaska to Idaho.

According to local media, the sixteen-year-old girl had been accused of being involved in the murder of Carlos Enrique Gonz√°lez Noriega, a 68-year-old moto taxi driver. Residents claimed the girl, along with two other men, shot Gonz√°lez Noriega after he had refused to pay protection money. The two male accomplices escaped, but the girl was captured by a mob and dragged to the town center. A crowd of at least one hundred people‚Äîincluding women and children‚Äîwatched as she was repeatedly punched and kicked by vigilantes. Police attempted to intervene, but were blocked from the area by the mob. After being severely beaten, a member of the crowd doused the girl in gasoline and burned her to death. Seven days after the lynching, a video of the attack surfaced online. The video was uploaded to YouTube, where it received thousands of views before being removed.

The named set is a theoretical concept that generalizes the structure of a name described by Frege. Its generalization bridges the descriptivists theory of a name, and its triad structure (name, sensation and reference),Burgin (2011), p. 19 with mathematical structures that define mathematical names using triplets. It deploys the former to view the latter at a higher abstract level that unifies a name and its relationship to a mathematical structure as a constructed reference. This enables all names in science and technology to be treated as named sets or as systems of named sets. Informally, named set theory is a generalization that studies collections of objects (may be, one object) connected to other objects (may be, to one object). The paradigmatic example of a named set is a collection of objects connected to its name. Mathematical examples of named sets are coordinate spaces (objects are points and coordinates are names of these points), vector fields on manifolds (objects are points of the manifold and vectors assigned to points are names of these points), binary relations between two sets (objects are elements of the first set and elements of the second set are names) and fiber bundles (objects form a topological space, names from another topological space and the connection is a continuous projection). The language of named set theory can be used in the definitions of all of these abstract objects. History In the 20th century, many generalizations of sets were invented, e.g., fuzzy sets (Zadeh, 1965), or rediscovered, e.g., multisets (Knuth, 1997). As a result, these generalizations created a unification problem in the foundation of mathematics. The concept of a named set was created as a solution to this problem. Its generalization of mathematical structures allowed for the unification of all known generalizations of sets. Later it was demonstrated that all basic mathematical structures either are some kinds of named sets or are built of named sets. According to Anellis, Burgin & Kaloujnine introduced set-theoretical named sets in 1983 and Burgin introduced named sets in the most general form in 1990. Since then Burgin continued to develop this theory in a series of papers and a book. In 2011, Zellweger applied the theory of named sets to model data relations in the relational database for an end-user interface.Zellweger (2011), p. 324 Basic concepts In mathematics, mathematical structures can have more than one definition. Therefore, there are several definitions of named sets, each representing a specific construction of named set theory. The informal definition is the most general. =Informal definition= A named set X has the form of a triad X = (X, f, I), in which X and I are two objects and f is a connection between X and I. It is represented by the fundamental triadBurgin (1990), p. in the following diagram. 328px Elementary set theory can be studied informally and intuitively, and so can be taught in primary schools using set-theoretical named sets and operations with them. =Axiomatic definition= Similar to set theory, named sets have axiomatic representations,Burgin (2011), p. 69‚Äì89 i.e., they are defined by systems of axioms and studied in axiomatic named set theory. Axiomatic definitions of named set theory show that in contrast to fuzzy sets and multisets, named set theory is completely independent of set theory or category theory while these theories are naturally conceived as sub- theories of named set theory. =Categorical definition= In a categorical definition,Burgin (2011) , p. 57‚Äì69 named sets are built inside a chosen (mathematical) category similar to the construction of set theory in a topos. Namely, given a category K, a named set in K is a triad X = (X, f, I), in which X and I are two objects from K and f is a morphism between X and I. =Set-theoretical definition= In a set-theoretical definition,Burgin (2011), p. 89-96 named sets are built using sets similar to constructions of fuzzy sets or multisets. Namely, a set-theoretical named set is a triad X = (X, f, I), in which X and I are two sets and f is a set-theoretical correspondence (binary relation) between X and I. Note that not all named sets are set-theoretical. The most transparent example of non-set-theoretical named sets is given by algorithmic named sets, which have the form X = (X, A, I), in which X and I are two constructive objects, for example, sets of words, and A is an algorithm that transforms X into I. =Algorithmic definition= In an algorithmic definition,Burgin (2011) p. 42 a named set A = (X, A, Y) consists of an algorithm A, the set X of inputs, and the set Y of outputs. Examples =Examples from everyday life= A name is given to a person, place, or thing to identify it. For example, parents can give their child a name or scientist can give an element a name. Examples of named sets include, *People, their names and relations between people and their names. *Countries, their names and relations between countries and their names. *Articles in an encyclopedia, their titles (as names) and relations between articles and their titles (connection). =Examples from physics= *Any physical field, such as the electromagnetic field, is a named set. =Examples from mathematics= Henri Poincar√© (1908) wrote that without a name no object exists in science or mathematics. Examples of such mathematical objects and their names as applications of named sets include, *Binary relations are set-theoretical name sets. Already in 1960, Bourbaki represented and studied a binary relation between sets A and B in the form of a name set (A, G, B), where G is a graph of the binary relation, i.e., a set of pairs, for which the first projection is a subset of A and the second projection is a subset of B (Bourbaki, 1960). *Functions are set-theoretical name sets as special cases of binary relations. *A fuzzy set is a named set (U, m, [0,1]) where U is a set, [0,1] is a unit interval and m is a membership function. *A graph G is a named set (V, E, V) where V is the set of vertices (nodes) of G and E is the set of edges of G. *A fiber bundle B is a named set (E, p, B) where the topological space E is the space of B; the topological space B the base of B; and p is a topological projection of E onto B such that every point in B has a neighborhood U such that p‚àí1(b) = F for all points b from B and p‚àí1(U) is homeomorphic to the direct product U √ó F where F is the fiber of B. Therefore, any set is actually a named set of the form (X, ‚àà, \\"X\\" ) where X is a set (without a name), \\"X\\" is the name of this set and connects elements from X to the name \\"X\\". That is why any description of set theory begins with a fundamental binary relation ‚àà. The next is basic binary relation ‚äÜ between two sets called the subset relation, or set inclusion. Some basic named sets of central importance are the empty named set (the unique set containing no objects, no names and the empty connection), the named set of natural numbers, in which numbers have names in natural languages and numerical systems (for example, the number ten has names: \\"10\\", \\"ten\\", \\"1010\\", \\"diez\\", \\"dix\\", \\"zehn\\", \\"X\\", and many others) and the set of real numbers, in which numbers are assigned point of a straight line as their names. Applications All mathematical constructions are named sets or systems of named sets. For example, mathematical structures as diverse as graphs, manifolds, vector spaces, natural and real numbers are identified by formally defined terms that satisfy various (axiomatic) properties. Each name and its correspondence to a mathematical expression of its structure constitute a named set. Equivalence and order relations, which are ubiquitous in mathematics, are binary relations, which in turn, are formally defined terms that correspond mathematical structures, whereby representing a system of named sets. All areas of science and technology have mathematics at its core.Burgin (2001), p. 82 In general, there are explicit and implicit applications of named sets in these fields. For instance, any classification or nomenclature, such as the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (2000), is an explicitly named set, where individual terms are well defined. Other examples of explicit applications of named sets are: *The theory of fiber bundles in topology *The theory of enumerations in computer science *Mathematical models in epistemology and methodology of science Examples of implicit applications of named sets include: *Relational databases *Tagging and labeling on the Internet, which has achieved wide popularity due to the growth of social networks, blogging, photography sharing and bookmarking sites *Mathematical linguistics In the case of relational databases, an application of named sets revealed an implicit uniform pattern of data relations hidden in the database called an Aleph.Zellweger (2016) p. 1 It is an abstract concept that generalizes the ubiquitous one-to-one and one-to-many data relations found throughout the database.

It is located in the Baglan area of Nashik district. There are two main hill ranges in Baglan area the Selbari range and Dholbari range. These two ranges run parallel to each other in east-west direction. Nhavigad is located in Selbari mountain range. All these forts were maintained to keep watch on the Burhanpur-Surat ancient commercial road. The road passes between the two hill ranges. Nhavigad is a small fort, but very difficult to climb. History In the records it is written that there was a fierce battle in 1439 between Bahamani king and the King of Gujarat at the base of the Nhavigad and adjoining Tambolya hill. Both sides received huge losses, hence both sides receded from the battleground at night.http://trekshitiz.com/ trekshitiz/marathi/Nhavigad-Trek-N-Alpha.html Places to see There are few rock cut cisterns and caves on the fort, else there is nothing to see. There is no fortification or significant construction on the fort. On the half way there is a small temple of Saptashringi devi. From the fort Mangi-Tungi, Salher, Salota, Hargad, Mulher, Mora forts are easily seen. How to reach There is a good motorable road up to the base village Patalwadi. It takes about one an hour to reach Patalwadi from the nearest town Taharabad. It is strictly advisable to get a local escort from village Patalwadi. The trek is a steady climb. The entire hill is devoid of trees or rocks. The pathway is very risky and becomes slippery in the monsoon. The rock cut steps are near the final climb of the fort. There is no good water on the fort, so it is advisable to carry enough water. It takes about one hour to climb the fort.

It stars Raveena Tandon in the lead role and Atul Kulkarni, Govind Namdev and Sameer Dharmadhikari appear in the supporting roles. The film narrates the story of a persecuted wife of an greedy politician who takes on his role after he lands up in jail because of murder charges. Released on 7 February 2003, Satta received critical acclaim upon release and is considered one of the best performances of Tandon. The film was released on the same day as Khushi, Baaz: A Bird in Danger and Kash Aap Hamare Hote. Plot Anuradha Sehgal (Raveena Tandon) re-locates to Mumbai, finds employment, meets and weds Delhi's aspiring Chief Minister, Vivek Chauhan (Sameer Dharmadhikari). She soon finds out that Vivek is a womanizer and an alcoholic. She then faces physical abuse. Vivek is arrested for murder and is jailed. The Chauhan family persuade her to stand for elections in her husband's place, which she does. She then witnesses the nexus between the underworld, businessmen, corrupt policemen and politicians.

O2-M117 has been detected in samples of Tamang (38/45 = 84.4%), Tibetans (45/156 = 28.8% or 13/35 = 37.1%), Tharus (57/171 = 33.3%), Han Taiwanese (40/183 = 21.9%), Newars (14/66 = 21.2%), the general population of Kathmandu, Nepal (13/77 = 16.9%), Han Chinese (5/34 = 14.7% Chengdu, 5/35 = 14.3% Harbin, 4/35 = 11.4% Meixian, 3/30 = 10.0% Lanzhou, 2/32 = 6.3% Yili), Tungusic peoples from the PRC (7/45 = 15.6% Hezhe, 4/26 = 15.4% Evenki, 5/35 = 14.3% Manchu, 2/41 = 4.9% Xibe, 1/31 = 3.2% Oroqen), and Uyghurs (2/39 = 5.1% Yili, 1/31 = 3.2% √úr√ºmqi) (Xue et al. 2006, Gayden et al. 2007, and Fornarino et al. 2009).

Origin The earliest attested genealogical split within haplogroup O-M117, that between O-M133 and O-M117(xM133), is estimated to have occurred approximately 11,900 [95% CI 10,600 <-> 13,200] ybp. However, members of O-M117(xM133) are quite rare among extant humans. O-M117(xM133) has been observed in 2.2% (1/46) of the CHB (Han Chinese in Beijing, China) sample of the 1000 Genomes Project. In commercial testing, O-MF1380 or O-CTS4960, which belongs to O-M117(xM133), has been found in one individual who has reported an origin in Guangdong, one individual who has reported an origin in Jiangsu, one individual who has reported an origin in Chongqing, one individual who has reported an origin in Indonesia, and one individual who has reported an origin in Japan. O-M117(xM133) also has been found in 1.5% (2/133) of a sample collected in Daejeon, South Korea and in 1.0% (6/573) of a sample collected in Seoul, South Korea. The most recent common ancestor of all extant members of the O-M133 subclade, which predominates among extant members of O-M117, is estimated to have lived in a significantly less ancient era: 7,200 [95% CI 6,500 <-> 7,900] ybp according to YFull, 7,455 [95% CI 6,514 <-> 8,500] years ago according to Karmin et al. 2015, or 7,500 or 6,400 years ago (depending on which estimate of the mutation rate is used) according to Poznik et al. 2016. Distribution =China= Haplogroup O-M117 or O-M133 has been found often in samples of Han Chinese from various parts of China: 10/34 = 29.4% O-M133 Hakka in Taiwan, 57/258 = 22.1% O-M133 miscellaneous Han volunteers in Taiwan, 4/19 = 21.1% Fujian (CHS), 12/60 = 20.0% O-M133 Minnan in Taiwan, 29/167 = 17.4% East China, 21/129 = 16.3% North China, 7/46 = 15.2% Beijing (CHB), 5/34 = 14.7% Chengdu, 5/35 = 14.3% Harbin, 9/65 = 13.8% South China, 7/55 = 12.7% O-M133 Fujian, 4/35 = 11.4% Meixian, 3/30 = 10.0% Lanzhou, 2/32 = 6.3% Yili, 1/37 = 2.7% Hunan (CHS).

Jollett at californiabirthindex.org is an American musician and author. He is best known as the frontman for American indie rock band the Airborne Toxic Event as well as the author of the New York Times bestselling memoir Hollywood Park (2020).https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2020/06/14/hardcover- nonfiction/ Early life Jollett was born in Santa Monica in the experimental commune society called Synanon. Until he was five, he and his older brother were raised apart from their parents in Synanon schools. Jollett's father had been incarcerated in Chino State Prison from 1963-1966 prior to joining Synanon where he overcame a heroin addiction. Jollett's mother was a social worker with a master's degree from the University of California, Berkeley, who met Jollett's father in Synanon. When the commune became violent, his mother took him and his brother to live in Oakland and then in Oregon. Jollett eventually moved to live with his father and step mother in Los Angeles, where he attended Westchester High School, graduating with a 4.3 GPA. During high school, Jollett participated in California YMCA Youth & Government's Model Legislature & Court program and served as the Speaker of the Assembly in 1992. California YMCA Youth & Government's 1992 Commemorative Book He later attended Stanford University, graduating with honors in 1996. While at Stanford, Jollett was a member of Claude Steele's lab group in which he conducted research on the concept of stereotype threat. Jollett's work focused on how negative racial stereotypes negatively affected the identity and test performance of high school students. Writing In the summer of 2008, McSweeney's issue 27 published Jollett's short story, \\"The Crack\\", which appeared between short stories by Liz Mandrell and Stephen King. He was a frequent contributor to All Things Considered on NPR, the Los Angeles Times, an editor at large for Men's Health and the managing editor of Filter magazine. Jollett was accepted to Yaddo Writer's Colony in 2005 to complete his novel based on \\"The Crack\\", but did not attend, choosing to pursue music instead. Jollett's memoir Hollywood Park was published on May 26, 2020. It debuted its first week at #8 on The New York Times Best Seller list.https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2020/06/14/hardcover- nonfiction/ Music career Jollett began seriously writing songs following a week in March 2006, during which he underwent a break-up and learned his mother had been diagnosed with cancer. This quick succession of events spurred a period of intense songwriting featured on the band's first album. In keeping with his literary background, Jollett named the band after a section of Don DeLillo's postmodern novel White Noise,[4] which won the National Book Award in 1985. In the book, a chemical spill from a railcar releases a poisonous cloud, dubbed by the military and media as an \\"airborne toxic event.\\" Jollett chose to name the band after the event in the novel which triggers the fear of death that fundamentally alters the protagonist's outlook on himself, his family, and his life. The band was born of a similar life-altering sequence of events, and thus, the themes of mortality and media consumption that arise from the novel's toxic cloud serve as a major impetus for Jollett's creative drive. The Airborne Toxic Event's debut album received favorable reviews from such outlets as the Los Angeles Times, Newsweek, Q, and Entertainment Weekly. Notably, the Boston Herald named the band's album \\"The Debut Album of the Year.\\" In addition, iTunes named \\"Sometime Around Midnight\\" the No. 1 Alternative Song of the Year on their Best of list. The song went on to become a certified gold single. The band has been signed to Island Records and Epic Records. They have developed a loyal live fan base with performances at many festivals including Coachella and Lollapalooza while headlining shows at the Greek Theatre, Central Park's Summer Stage and Red Rocks with the Colorado Symphony. Personal life Jollett's father died in 2015. He and his wife Lizette have a son and a daughter and live in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles.

In 1908, the William Sutton Trust, established by philanthropist William Richard Sutton, purchased the area. They demolished the houses and built 14 red-brick residential buildings, designed by architect E.C.P. Monson, for social housing. The buildings, which housed 2,200 people in 764 apartments, were completed in 1913. The buildings are currently owned by Clarion Housing Group, a housing association formed by the merger of Affinity Sutton, an affordable housing trust in London and owner of Sutton Estate, and Circle Housing in 2016. On 15 November 2015, Affinity Sutton submitted a planning application for a regeneration and demolition project that would see most of the estate's blocks (buildings A-K, N-O) replaced with new buildings containing a mix of private and social housing, reducing the number of social housing units by nearly a third. Residents accused the trust of \\"social cleansing\\", and in 2015 some of the inhabitants of the estate formed Save the Sutton Estate Ltd., a non-profit organisation whose main goal was to stop the demolition of the estate and further their alternative proposal for infill development and rehabilitation of existing units. In 2016, Clarion (Affinity) moved residents out of 159 flats and had workmen make the properties uninhabitable to squatters by smashing windows, doors, sinks and toilets in advance of a plan to demolish the buildings and replace them with 237 new social rent flats and 100 to be sold at market rate to support the redevelopment. In November 2016, Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council rejected planning permission for the estate demolition and redevelopment application submitted by Clarion (Affinity Sutton) on the grounds that the net loss of social housing units was unacceptable, and a public inquiry was held. In August 2017, it was suggested that the empty flats could temporarily house the survivors from the Grenfell Tower fire in North Kensington. Clarion Housing Group appealed to the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government against the decision by Kensington and Chelsea to reject their plan, arguing that they had revised their plans to increase the provision of social housing to avoid a net loss in social housing, and as such their original application (with revisions) should be approved. On 18 December 2018 the Secretary of State issued a decision refusing the appeal and upheld Kensington and Chelsea Council's view that an entirely new application would be required. Clarion voiced their upset at what they described as refusal on the grounds of a \\"technicality\\", and as of 2019 they are conducting consultations on the creation of an entirely new plan for the development of the estate. Residents year-long campaign against Clarion‚Äôs scheme recruited celebrity supporters including Chelsea resident actress Felicity Kendal and comedian Eddie Izzard. In August 2019 the estate was added to an existing conservation area, making them protected historic buildings by the City of Kensington & Chelsea. Finally in November 2019 Clarion Housing announced the four empty blocks would get a complete makeover, and at least 80 homes will be for social rent, with priority for existing Sutton estate residents. The remaining 303 flats will get new kitchens and bathrooms, and the grounds refurbished.

He is pastor of the Royal Court Parish and chaplain to the King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. Michael Bjerkhagen at the National Day of Sweden 2016. Early life He left Sri Lanka in July 1972 when he was 5-years-old with his adoptive sister, having been adopted by a childless Swedish couple Christer Bjerkhagen. Both he and his adoptive sister were at the same orphanage, Evelyn Nurseries Orphanage, in Kandy. His adoptive father, Michael Bjerkhagen, was a Colonel of the Royal Cavalry Regiment and his adoptive mother was an economist. He did not have difficulty communicating with his adoptive parents as he was fluent in English from his childhood as his biological mother was of Burgher descent; his birth father came from a Buddhist family with a long tradition in Sri Lanka. He had a prosperous upbringing in Sweden and grew up in a big manor house. His family has been equestrian competitors leading him to develop riding skills. He was taught to respect the Throne, the Cross and the Sword (meaning the Monarchy, the Church and the Armed Forces), as well as learning to help others and caring for those who are less fortunate.Ten years after his arrival in Sweden, his family adopted his other sister. Education His primary education was at Stenstorp School in the west of Sweden. Then he went to √Ölleberg High School in Falk√∂ping where he studied both Latin and Greek, which alongside religion studies were his favourite subjects. He had a good singing voice and was a boy soprano before he became a tenor. After he graduated from high school and finished basic military training, he decided to further his studies to become a priest. He studied to theology at Sweden‚Äôs oldest university in Uppsala (founded in 1477) with the intentions of becoming a priest. He also spent a year at an English theological college in Lincoln in Northeastern England. At Uppsala, his specialist subjects were New Testament Exegesis and classical Greek. Old Testament Exegesis and Hebrew as well as Psychology of Religions and Church History. His other great interests during the study period were ecumenism and the so- necessary dialogue between religions. In 1990, he took a master's degree in Theology in 1991 was ordained as priest in the Church of Sweden, Diocese of Stockholm, and Stockholm Cathedral. He immediately hired by one of the inner-city congregations St. Johannes, and after that H√∂galid. In 2002-2003, he began his graduate studies in Liturgy and Ecumenism at the Pontifical University Angelicum in Rome. He stayed at a home for priests in the Vatican. Hebecame conversant in the Italian language devoted himself to my hobbies: history and archeology. Personal life According to Bjerkhagen, his dream since childhood was to become a priest. His parents supported his wish and helped him to become a priest. He found information about his birth parents through the Evelyn Nurseries his godparents in Sri Lanka. They helped him to find the details of his parents from the files of the Evelyn Orphanage. He went to Sri Lanka for the first time in the summer 2011 to discover his family. He discovered that his parents had died. However, he met his godparents and seven siblings, spending about two weeks with them before returning to Sweden. But since his visit, he thinks about his family and his country and feels that he has two homes; one in Sweden and one in Sri Lanka. Work as a priest He was ordained as priest in the Church of Sweden in 1991. In March 2013, he did liturg at the funeral of Princess Lilian and June 8, 2013 one of the two priests at the wedding of Princess Madeleine and Christopher O'Neill and also one of the two priests at the wedding between Prince Carl Philip and Sofia Hellqvist June 13, 2015. He also wants to work for the people of Sri Lanka to share knowledge to help people and to develop his country. One of his causes Father Michael Bjerkhagen is helping orphanages in Sri Lanka. One of them is The St. Johns boys home in Kegalle.

Durnbaugh has described John Kline as \\"arguably the most beloved personality in Brethren History.\\" Kline was born in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania on 17 June 1797, the son of John Kline (1763‚Äì1844) and Mary Hershey Kline (1770‚Äì1850). While he was still a boy, the family moved to Rockingham County, Virginia. On 18 March 1818, before he was twenty-one, he married Anna Wampler (1796‚Äì1885), the daughter of John Wampler and Magdalene Garber Wampler. He bought a farm on Linville Creek in what is now the town of Broadway, about five miles north of Harrisonburg, Virginia. He and his wife had only one child, a baby daughter, born on 15 March 1819, who did not live and was unnamed. At some point Kline joined the German Baptist Brethren church. In 1827, he was chosen to serve as deacon by the Linville Creek congregation of the church. He was \\"called\\" to the preaching ministry in 1830 and like other Brethren ministers of his day, he served without remuneration throughout his life. At first the Brethren met in members' home or barns or even in open fields, and Kline gave both land and money to build the Linville Creek German Baptist Brethren Church. He frequently traveled to southwest Virginia and to what is now West Virginia, preaching and baptizing and visiting Brethren families. Sometimes he was able to establish new congregations. The Brethren Encyclopedia says that \\"according to [Kline's] records, he may have covered as much as during his lifetime, mostly on horseback.\\" Kline also studied and practiced the medical procedures of one Dr. Samuel Thompson of Vermont so that he could treat the sick as well as minister to people spiritually. At the 1861 Annual Meeting of the church, Kline was elected moderator, the highest elected office of the church, and he was re- elected in each of next three years. He opposed both slavery and war and when war came between North and South, he lobbied the Virginia legislature and other officials to help make it possible for the Brethren to honor their pacifist beliefs and their objection to participating in the military. He and his good friend and in-law Benjamin F. Moomaw of Botetourt County argued that Brethren farmers could be of more assistance to the Confederate cause by supplying the troops with food than they could by fighting. During the Civil War Kline crossed Union‚ÄìConfederate lines to attend church meetings. He was able to obtain passes from both sides (though both were wary of him since he gave medical and spiritual help to both Union and Confederate troops). At one time, suspected of holding Union sympathies, he was imprisoned for two weeks in Virginia. On 15 June 1864, while returning from a trip north, he was ambushed and killed near his home by young Confederate sympathizers. His death was deeply mourned; he was widely regarded among his fellow Baptist Brethren as a wise counselor and a highly effective evangelist.

It was first published in 1764, printed in Geneva in twelve volumes. A second edition, published ten years later, added extensive critical commentary, reflecting changes in Voltaire's attitude to Corneille and to criticism. It was Voltaire's largest ever work of critical commentary, described by the author as a distillation of his fifty years of experience in theatre. Though very influential in the late eighteenth century, it was seen more negatively from 1800 onwards, as critics questioned the fairness of Voltaire's commentary and his motives.  Background  Voltaire wrote to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise on 10 April 1761, praising its effort to create standard editions of classic French literature. He asked for permission to edit a version of Corneille's dramas as part of this wider project.\\"Introduction\\" in Commentaires sur Corneille Critical edition by David Williams, in ≈íuvres compl√®tes de Voltaire Volume 53 (Voltaire Foundation, Oxford) The response from Charles Pinot Duclos, the Acad√©mie's permanent secretary, was unenthusiastic. Voltaire wrote again on 1 May, with a more detailed proposal. He described Corneille as the Homer of the French language: a unique figure who had made the language popular in foreign cultures and shown that French work could be great art. He promised that funds raised by the publication would benefit a living relative of Corneille's, Marie Fran√ßoise Corneille. The proposal drew a favourable response from a meeting of the Acad√©mie, which was communicated to Voltaire on 19 May.  Content  Pierre Corneille Along with unaltered versions of Corneille's texts, Voltaire provided two layers of annotation. The first edition included footnotes and the second edition (published 1774) added five hundred sections of critical commentary. Between compiling the two editions, Voltaire's opinion of Corneille as a dramatist became much more negative. This is reflected in the second set of annotations which are more critical in scope and tone.\\"The commentary\\" in Commentaires sur Corneille Critical edition by David Williams, in ≈íuvres compl√®tes de Voltaire Volume 53 p. 192 (Voltaire Foundation, Oxford) Voltaire's enthusiasm for the project had been driven in part by a desire to defend classic French literature and values against foreign cultural influences. In the first edition, he had portrayed Corneille as a neglected genius: though there were some criticisms, they were muted and the commentary focused on the better works. By the second edition, Voltaire was more conscious of a critic's duty to be objective and to help others learn from an artist's mistakes. The volumes also contained texts from other authors, chosen by Voltaire for comparison with Corneille's work. These included a translation of the first three acts of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar and extracts from plays by Jean Racine and Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca. In letters to the Acad√©mie, Voltaire defended comparison against these foreign texts as an essential part of criticism.  Reception  Marie Corneille, who had been in poverty when Voltaire made his proposal to the Acad√©mie, made a large sum of money from sales of the books. The publication of the Commentaires sur Corneille energised an already highly polarised debate about Corneille and French drama in general. From 1800 onwards, critics accused Voltaire of pedantry, petty criticism and envy. Napoleon expressed a preference for Corneille over Voltaire, reviving the former's reputation as a dramatist while diminishing the latter's. Modern scholars, however, have largely neglected the Commentaires compared to Voltaire's other works. David Williams writes that \\"the surgical precision with which Voltaire remorselessly exposed the minutiae of Cornellian technique has, it would seem, taxed beyond endurance the patience of all but a handful of contemporary friends and supporters.\\"\\"Preface\\" in Commentaires sur Corneille Critical edition by David Williams, in ≈íuvres compl√®tes de Voltaire Volume 53 (Voltaire Foundation, Oxford) Published editions * Commentaires sur Corneille Critical edition by David Williams, in ≈íuvres compl√®tes de Voltaire Volumes 53 to 55 (Voltaire Foundation, Oxford)  References  Category:1764 books Category:1774 books Category:Works by Voltaire Category:Pierre Corneille Category:Theatre in France Category:Books of literary criticism ","title":"Commentaires sur Corneille"},{"id":"50425732","text":"Laura Zacchilli (born 2 October 1980) is an Italian individual rhythmic gymnast.

This is needed so that the magnetic ignition mechanism of naval mines or torpedoes are not triggered. The mere demagnetization is to be distinguished from that with which the permanent magnetic orientation of a metal hulk can be lifted with a strong magnetic field for some time. History The first magnetic self-protection equipment was developed at the beginning of World War II because of the advent of magnetically detonated mines. This was initially a cable which was placed along the entire length to the hull of the vessel and the application of direct current produced a magnetic field that counteracted the magnetic field of the steel mass of the vessel. During the second world war these methods of mine protection were standard for all large battle ships. A simple magnetic coil, however, was no longer capable of adequately compensating for the increasingly sophisticated magneto ignition, for the non-uniform magnetic field of a ship and for the variable effects of the Earth's magnetic field in different regions of the world. Present Modern MSP systems consist of a plurality of electromagnetic coils which suppress the magnetic signature in several directions. For that, the signature of the vessel is accurately measured under various conditions first, so that the signature of counteracting magnetic fields can be suitably generated. For the majority of the vessels of the German Navy, this is done in the two magnetic measurement and treatment centers in Wilhelmshaven and Kiel. Not only must the uneven distribution of magnetic disturbances in the hull and the variable magnetic field in various areas of the world be taken into account, but also the movements of vessels (speed, rolling movements) or magnetic effects caused by units not constantly in use. Accordingly, an MSP system today does not generate a static magnetic field any more, but a magnetic field which is tailored depending on the location and movement, as well as various internal processes of the ship. In so-called highly protected vessels, such as anti- mine vessels or submarines that by construction already have a low magnetic signature, it can be almost completely eliminated with the aid of MSP systems. The German Navy maintains an Earth's magnetic field simulator for this purpose in the Borgsted narrows at Schirnau-Lehmbek, in which the MSP system is adjusted accordingly for the entire vessel in various operating states and for different measured latitudes.

The CCCS design differs from the consecutive case series, because the latter reports on multiple cases where experimental control was not demonstrated, usually because a pre-post non experimental design was used. In contrast, a CCCS includes only cases where the intervention was evaluated using single- case experimental designs, such as a reversal design, where experimental control is demonstrated through the replication of treatment effects for each individual participant. Thus, the CCCS design has better internal validity than a consecutive case series. The CCCS design also address some concerns about the external validity or generality of findings of small-n single-case experimental design studies because it explicitly includes all cases encountered, regardless of outcome. By including all cases, any bias favoring a particular outcome in controlled for, resulting in stronger external validity relative to studies describing fewer cases that were not consecutively encountered. Moreover, when a large number of individuals are included in the series, this provides opportunities to identify variables that may predict treatment outcomes. Consecutive controlled case-series studies examining behavior analytic interventions of late have examined functional communication training.Rooker, G.W., Jessel, J., Kurtz, P.F. and Hagopian, L.P.

When the sample in the series is drawn from a particular clinic, there is the potential that that sample may not be representative of the broader population because of referral bias. One additional limitation of reporting on a series of cases receiving clinical treatment (as opposed to participants enrolled in a formal research protocol) is that there tend to be variations in how the treatment is applied across participants. This is particularly the case with behavioral interventions which are individualized, and continuously evaluated, and altered based on the individual‚Äôs response. An ideal middle ground would involve the use of treatment algorithms to structure how treatment components are sequenced while still preserving the response-guided approach that is the hallmark of good clinical practice in applied behavior.

Discussion  To understand this metric, consider a function (hardware or software) that outputs one of two states: (‚Äò1‚Äô) or (‚Äò0‚Äô). Further, assume that each output state occurs 50% of the time. Because of this minimal output space size, a fair coin toss also has a 50-50 chance of providing a correct output for any given input, and that could certainly be less expensive than the cost to build and implement the function. Worse, consider the scenario where ‚Äò1‚Äô and ‚Äò0‚Äô are not evenly distributed, e.g., the specification states that for 1M unique test cases only 10 should produce a ‚Äò1‚Äô and the other 999,990 should produce a ‚Äò0‚Äô. Here, you could build this function or you could write a piece of code that simply says: for all inputs output (‚Äò0‚Äô). This incorrect code is still 99.999 reliable, and you‚Äôll almost certainly not discover the defect in the code with a handful of random tests sampled from the 1M. In short, testing here has a minimal probability of detecting this faulty logic because each test case has such a low probability of revealing the defective logic due to the tiny output space and its probability density function for each output. If you view the definition of a testable system to be one where test cases have a reasonable chance of detecting defects, then a high DRR suggest low observability of defects during test, and hence low testability*. _____________________ * Testability here refers to the likelihood that defects can be discovered during testing.Voas, J.M. and Miller, K.W., ‚ÄúSoftware testability: the new verification‚Äù, IEEE Software, 12(3), 17-28 (May 1995).

But unlike in Europe, harana in the Philippines is generally a formal way of getting to meet lady visitors in rural Philippines. ln harana, the songs that are usually sung are dansas like \\"0 llaw\\", \\"Maala-ala ...\\" Form Sometimes traditionally done with friends or with musicians Traditionally, the suitor will visit the house of the girl he is trying to woo, and sing by her window until she comes out to either accept or deny him. The suitor may or may not be accompanied, but usually his companions will be playing a guitar or back up vocals as he sings. Ideally, the dalaga or young lass will come to the window and invite her suitor to come inside. Inside, the father and daughter will sit in the living room where the suitor will stay standing unless given permission to sit. If the suitor wishes to make a good first impression, he must already have pasalubong or gifts for the girl's family. At the living room, though the daughter is present, the father will do all the talking and interrogate the suitor about his family history, aspirations, current economic status, and intentions with his daughter. History The Harana first gained popularity in the early part of the Spanish period. Its influence comes from folk Music of Spain and the mariachi sounds of Mexico. It is a traditional form of courtship music in which a man woos a woman by singing underneath her window at night. It is widely practiced in many parts of the Philippines with a set of protocols, a code of conduct, and a specific style of music. Harana itself uses mainly Hispanic protocols in music, although its origins lie in the old pre-colonial Philippine musical styles which still practised around the country (See also Kapanirong style of the Maguindanao people of Mindanao). The main instrument used for Harana is the guitar, played by the courter, although other string instruments such as the Ukulele and less frequently, the violin and trumpets are also used. The word harana has derived from the Spanish string instrument of the same name. It resembles a guitar, but is smaller in nature.

The film is loosely based on the first and second stories of day three of ten of The Decameron, a collection of novellas by Giovanni Boccaccio, an Italian writer during the Middle Ages. It stars an ensemble cast featuring Alison Brie, Dave Franco, Kate Micucci, Aubrey Plaza, John C. Reilly, and Molly Shannon. Set in the 14th century, the film is told in an anachronistic style with contemporary dialogue and behavior. The plot jointly follows the lives of three nuns at a convent in the countryside who try to fornicate with a young gardener posing as a deaf-mute after he escapes from being punished by his lord for adultery with the man's wife. The film held its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2017, and was released on June 30, 2017, by . The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for the cast's performances. Plot In the year 1347 in Garfagnana, Italy, a convent of nuns is led by Father Tommasso. The three nuns at the center of the story are: Alessandra, who wants a better life for herself but is held at the convent due to her father's support of the church rather than her own bidding; Ginevra, a gossip who is later revealed to be a Jewish lesbian; and Fernanda, an emotionally unstable and violent woman. The three of them routinely assault the friendly gardener Lurco, who quits in disgust. Meanwhile, in Lunigiana, a young servant named Massetto gets caught having sexual relations with his master's wife. While on the run, he discovers Father Tommasso, who has gone to sell some embroidery but has instead gotten drunk and lost his possessions in the river. Massetto helps him return home and the two arrange to have Massetto work as a gardener while pretending to be a deaf-mute, in hopes that this will dissuade the nuns from giving him trouble. Fernanda's friend Marta appears and encourages Alessandra and Ginevra to get drunk off the sacramental wine while explaining how being with a man is the greatest possible pleasure. Fernanda takes Ginevra back to her room where they have sex. Massetto and Alessandra begin to form a closer bond while Ginevra begins to have feelings for Fernanda. Later, Fernanda kidnaps Massetto at knife-point and takes him into the forest, where she meets up with a coven of witches. She attempts to perform a fertility ritual with Massetto but is stopped by the arrival of Alessandra and Ginevra. Ginevra, under the hallucinogenic effects of belladonna, takes off her clothes and begins dancing and steals the convent's donkey. Massetto reveals that he is not a deaf-mute while trying to free himself. They return to the convent, and all of their secrets are revealed in the presence of the visiting Bishop Bartolomeo. Father Tommasso is sent away to become a monk after it is discovered that he and the Mother Superior are in love and have a secret relationship. Massetto is returned to his master and is held in a jail cell with the impending threat of torture and death until the three nuns (who have reconciled and formed an even stronger friendship) help him escape. While Alessandra, Massetto, Ginevra, and Fernanda each run hand-in-hand back to the convent, the Mother Superior and Father Tommasso have met up in secret under the pretense that the Mother Superior has gone to retrieve the donkey. They hide as the nuns and Massetto run by. Fernanda stops and stares in puzzlement at the once again freed donkey that she herself used as an excuse so many times to escape the convent, until Ginevra pulls her away. With the group gone, Father Tommasso and Mother Superior embrace and smile at each other.

It satirises Christian imagery, including the story of Adam and Eve, to defend a way of life focused on worldly pleasure rather than the promised pleasure of a religion's afterlife. It opposes religious morality and especially the teaching of original sin. Its points echo Voltaire's prose works Lettres philosophiques and Remarques sur Pascal. Voltaire noted a trend against using poetic forms to make philosophical arguments, and wrote \\"Le Mondain\\" in deliberate opposition to this trend.\\"Introduction\\" in \\"Le Mondain\\" ‚Äì Critical edition by Haydn T. Mason, in ≈íuvres compl√®tes de Voltaire, Volume 16 (Voltaire Foundation, Oxford)  Content  The poem is set in the Garden of Eden but, contrary to the teaching of original sin, Eden is not portrayed as a paradise from which man would be expelled, but a state of barbarity. Adam's nails are described as long and dirty since no-one has yet invented a tool to trim or clean them. The implication is that the world we experience is hence not a prison into which we have been thrown as punishment. Instead, the poem's closing line says, \\"Le paradis terrestre est o√π je suis\\" (\\"The earthly paradise is where I am.\\")  Reaction  Line 22 of the poem, \\"Le superflu, chose tr√®s-n√©cessaire\\" (\\"The superfluous, a very necessary thing\\"), became a common catch-phrase. Responding to hostile reactions in 1737, Voltaire wrote a poem in the same style, D√©fense du Mondain ou l'apologie du luxe (\\"Defense of the Worldling or an Apology for Luxury\\"). The themes of the two are somewhat different; \\"Le Mondain\\" focusing on the personal benefits of worldly pleasure, while the D√©fense talks about the social benefits of seeking pleasure. The French dramatist Alexis Piron wrote a poem in response, L'Antimondain, in 1738. The poem's publication caused a scandal which led to Voltaire fleeing in 1738 from the Chateau de Cirey in France to Brussels, where he spent three months before returning.

Episodic in character, it seems to have been composed from linking together the apodoses of omen literature, excerpts of the Weidner Chronicle and year-names. It begins with events from the late third-millennium reign of Sargon of Akkad and ends, where the tablet is broken away, with that of Agum III, c.a 1500 BC. A third Babylonian Chronicle Fragment B, Mesopotamian Chronicle 41 deals with related subject matter and may be a variant tradition of the same type of work. The text Tablet A begins with a lengthy passage concerning the rise and eventual downfall of Sargon of Akkad, caused by his impious treatment of Babylon: This seemingly anachronous reference to Babylon reproduces text from the Weidner Chronicle. Little is known of the city of Babylon in the third- millennium with the earliest reference to it coming from a year-name of ≈†ar- kali-≈°arri, Sargon‚Äôs grandson. In contrast, the Chronicle devotes a mere six lines to his nephew, Naram-Sin, and two campaigns against Api≈°al, a city located in northern Syria, and Magan, thought to be in ancient Oman. That of Api≈°al appears as an apodosis to an omen in the BƒÅr√ªtu, the compendium of sacrificial omens. ≈†ulgi receives short shrift from Marduk, who wreaks a terrible revenge for his expropriation of the property of Marduk‚Äôs temple, the √âsagil, and Babylon, as he ‚Äúcaused (something or other) to consume his body and killed him‚Äù in a passage that, despite its perfect state of preservation, remains unintelligible. Erra-Imittƒ´‚Äôs legendary tale of his demise and that of Enlil-bƒÅni‚Äôs ascendency occupies the next passage, followed by a terse observation that ‚ÄúIlu-≈°≈´ma was king of Assyria in time of Su-abu‚Äù, who was once identified with Sumu-abum, the founder of the First Dynasty of Babylon until a consideration of the relative chronologies made this identification unlikely. The tablet concludes with the label or mark GIGAM.DIDLI which may have been a scribal catalog reference or alternatively denote continuing disruption, as GIGAM represents ippiru, ‚Äústrife, conflict.‚Äù note 82 Tablet B opens with a duplication of the six lines telling of the demise of Erra- Imittƒ´, followed by a section relating ·∏™ammu-rƒÅpi‚Äôs expedition against Rim-Sin I, whom he brought to Babylon in a ki-is-kap (a ·∏´√∫ppu), a large basket.CAD ·∏™, ·∏™uppu A, p. 238. Samsu-iluna‚Äôs handling of the revolt of Rim-Sin II occupies the next section, but here the text is poorly preserved and the events uncertain until it records the victory of Ilum-ma-ilƒ´, the founder of the Sealand Dynasty, over Samsu-iluna‚Äôs army. Abƒ´-E≈°u·∏´‚Äôs damming of the Tigris follows, which fails to contain the wiley Ilum-ma-ilƒ´.

Through it, the French 17th century became identified with Louis XIV of France, who reigned from 1643 to 1715.  Background  A letter in May 1732 is the first recorded mention of Voltaire's intent to write a history of the reign of Louis XIV. He stopped and resumed the project multiple times, expressing the fear that he might not live long enough to complete it. For preparation, he read two hundred volumes of material, plus many unpublished memoirs, as well as historical documents he found in the archives of the Louvre.  Content  In common with other Enlightenment philosophers, Voltaire saw the age of Alexander the Great and Pericles, the age of Caesar and Augustus, and the Italian Renaissance as \\"great ages\\" or \\"ages of light\\". He presented the age of Louis XIV as the fourth and greatest. The period covered by the history corresponds neither to the 17th century nor the reign of Louis XIV, running from the last years of Cardinal Richelieu to the years after Louis XIV's death, in 36 chapters. Voltaire described this as the age in which the arts and philosophy achieved their greatest perfection. By praising the excellence of a past age, he implicitly criticised the reign of Louis XV as an age of decline. Voltaire repeatedly remarked that he aimed less at a conventional history of great men and events, than something like a painting: he highlighted historical and cultural trends in the way that a painter brings out shadings of light and color which may be more important than the ostensible subject depicted. Rather than chronicling military victories, he saw more greatness in the progress of reason and culture, such as the advance of art or the rejection of medieval superstition and the end of imprisonment for sorcery.  Reception  The Protestant writer Laurent Angliviel de la Beaumelle published an annotated version of the book, Notes sur le si√®cle de Louis XIV, in 1753, adding many attacks against Voltaire. In the early 19th century, the English writer Hannah More wrote that Voltaire had \\"decorated both the period and the king with so much that is great and brilliant, that they fill a large space in the eye of the reader.\\" The American writer Virginia Randolph Cary wrote in 1828 that \\"Voltaire's General History, and his Age of Lewis XIV, will always be read with pleasure.\\" The publication of new editions of The Age of Louis XIV in the late 20th century helped to renew interest in Voltaire as a historian. Modern scholars have described it as \\"the foundational text of French literary history\\" and \\"a milestone on the road to modern history-writing\\".

Mourning is also curator of an esoteric bookstore, Orphic Vellum Books, the only one of its kind in the U.S., and has appeared in several publications including Gothic Beauty, Elle Magazine and writing contributor for Celtic Family Magazine. Career Wednesday Mourning was born in San Antonio, Texas circa 1978. Her chosen name Wednesday is based on a Victorian nursery rhyme Monday's Child. The surname of Mourning was added later. By the age of fourteen, Mourning was inspired by a scene in the film The Hunger when the gothic music group Bauhaus appeared on stage. She began her career in modeling at the age of seventeen while working at a club where she was asked to be on the club‚Äôs flyer. After moving to Hollywood, Mourning worked as both an actress (appearing in Star Trek, 2009) and model; becoming a regular for Lip Service, A Raven Above Press, and working various runway shows including Ventura Fashion Week (2008), Hello Kitty Fashion Show (2009), and Visions\\" SXSW (2010). Since 2008, Mourning has appeared in a variety of print media including books Gothic: Dark Glamour by Valerie Steel, Black Magic, White Noise by R. Klanten, and Eternal by VK Forest.

Like the Earth, the crustal properties and structure of the surface of Mars are thought to have evolved through time; in other words, as on Earth, tectonic processes have shaped the planet. However, both the ways this change has happened and the properties of the planet's lithosphere are both very different when compared to the Earth. Today, Mars is believed to be largely tectonically inactive. However, observational evidence and its interpretation suggests that this was not the case further back in Mars' geological history. At the scale of the whole planet, two large scale physiographic features are apparent on the surface. The first is that the northern hemisphere of the planet is much lower than the southern, and has been more recently resurfaced ‚Äì also implying that the crustal thickness beneath the surface is distinctly bimodal. This feature is referred to as the \\"hemispheric dichotomy\\". The second is the Tharsis rise, a massive volcanic province that has had major tectonic influences both on a regional and global scale in Mars' past. On this basis, the surface of Mars is often divided into three major physiographic provinces, each with different geological and tectonic characteristics: the northern plains, the southern highlands, and the Tharsis plateau. Much tectonic study of Mars seeks to explain the processes that led to the planet's division into these three provinces, and how their differing characteristics arose. Hypotheses proposed to explain how the two primary tectonic events may have occurred are usually divided into endogenic (arising from the planet itself) and exogenic (foreign to the planet, e.g., meteorite impact) processes. This distinction occurs throughout the study of tectonics on Mars. In general, Mars lacks unambiguous evidence that terrestrial-style plate tectonics has shaped its surface. However, in some places magnetic anomalies in the Martian crust that are linear in shape and of alternating polarity have been detected by orbiting satellites. Some authors have argued that these share an origin with similar stripes found on Earth's seafloor, which have been attributed to gradual production of new crust at spreading mid-ocean ridges. Other authors have argued that large-scale strike-slip fault zones can be identified on the surface of Mars (e.g., in the Valles Marineris trough), which can be likened to plate-bounding transform faults on Earth such as the San Andreas and Dead Sea faults. These observations provide some indication that at least some parts of Mars may have undergone plate tectonics deep in its geological past.  Physiographic provinces  = Southern highlands = The southern highlands are heavily cratered and separated from the northern plains by the global dichotomy boundary. Strong magnetic stripes with alternating polarity run roughly E-W in the southern hemisphere, concentric with the south pole. These magnetic anomalies are found in rocks dating from the first 500 million years in Mars‚Äô history, indicating that an intrinsic magnetic field would have ceased to exist before the early Noachian. The magnetic anomalies on Mars measure 200 km width, roughly ten times wider than those found on Earth. = Northern plains = The northern plains are several kilometers lower in elevation than the southern highlands, and have a much lower crater density, indicating a younger surface age. The underlying crust is however thought to be the same age as that of the southern highlands. Unlike the southern highlands, magnetic anomalies in the northern plains are sparse and weak. = Tharsis plateau = Geological map of the region around the Tharsis plateau. Extensional and compressional features ‚Äì e.g., graben and wrinkle ridges ‚Äì have been mapped and are visible in the image. (USGS, 2014). The Tharsis plateau, which sits in the highland-lowland boundary, is an elevated region that covers roughly one quarter of the planet. Tharsis is topped by the largest shield volcanoes known in the solar system. Olympus Mons stands 24 km tall and is nearly 600 km in diameter. The adjoining Tharsis Montes consists of Ascraeus, Pavonis, and Arsia. Alba Mons, at the northern end of the Tharsis plateau, is 1500 km in diameter, and stands 6 km above the surrounding plains. In comparison, Mauna Loa is a meager 120 km wide and stands 9 km above the sea floor. The load of Tharsis has had both regional and global influences. Extensional features radiating from Tharsis include graben several kilometers wide, and hundreds of meters deep, as well as enormous troughs and rifts up to 600 km wide and several kilometers deep. These graben and rifts are bounded by steeply dipping normal faults, and can extend for distances up to 4000 km. Their relief indicates that they accommodate small amounts of extension on the order of 100 m or less. It has been argued that these graben are surface expressions of deflated subsurface dikes. Circumferential to Tharsis are so- called wrinkle ridges. These are compressional structures composed of linear asymmetric ridges that can be tens of kilometers wide and hundreds of kilometers long. Many aspects of these ridges appear to be consistent with terrestrial compressional features that involve surface folding overlying blind thrust faults at depth. Wrinkle ridges are believed to accommodate small amounts of shortening on the order of 100 m or less. Larger ridges and scarps have also been identified on Mars. These features can be several kilometers high (as opposed to hundreds of meters high for wrinkle ridges), and are thought to represent large lithosphere-scale thrust faults. Displacement ratios for these are ten times those of wrinkle ridges, with shortening estimated to be hundreds of meters to kilometers. Approximately half of the extensional features on Mars formed during the Noachian, and have changed very little since, indicating that tectonic activity peaked early on and decreased with time. Wrinkle ridge formation both around Tharsis and in the eastern hemisphere is thought to have peaked in the Hesperian, likely due to global contraction attributed to cooling of the planet.  Hemispheric dichotomy  = Hypsometry = Histogram of crustal thickness versus area on Mars, adapted from Neumann et al., 2004. The hemispheric dichotomy is clear in the two peaks in the data. Gravity and topography data show that crustal thickness on Mars is resolved into two major peaks, with modal thicknesses of 32 km and 58 km in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively. Regionally, the thickest crust is associated with the Tharsis plateau, where crustal thickness in some areas exceeds 80 km, and the thinnest crust with impact basins. The major impact basins collectively make up a small histogram peak from 5 to 20 km. The origin of the hemispheric dichotomy, which separates the northern plains from the southern highlands, has been subject to much debate. Important observations to take into account when considering its origin include the following: (1) The northern plains and southern highlands have distinct thicknesses, (2) the crust underlying the northern plains is essentially the same age as the crust of the southern highlands, and (3) the northern plains, unlike the southern highlands, contain sparse and weak magnetic anomalies. As will be discussed below, hypotheses for the formation of the dichotomy can largely be divided into endogenic and exogenic processes. = Endogenic origins = A possible plate tectonic explanation for the northern lowlands. The Boreal plate is shown in yellow. Trenches are shown by toothed lines, ridges by double lines, and transform faults by single lines, modified from Sleep, 1994. Endogenic hypotheses include the possibility of a very early plate tectonic phase on Mars. Such a scenario suggests that the northern hemispheric crust is a relic oceanic plate. In the preferred reconstruction, a spreading center extended north of Terra Cimmeria between Daedalia Planum and Isidis Planitia. As spreading progressed, the Boreal plate broke into the Acidalia plate with south-dipping subducting beneath Arabia Terra, and the Ulysses plate with east-dipping subducting beneath Tempe Terra and Tharsis Montes. According to this reconstruction, the northern plains would have been generated by a single spreading ridge, with Tharsis Montes qualifying as an island arc. However, subsequent investigations of this model show a general lack of evidence for tectonism and volcanism in areas where such activity was initially predicted. Another endogenic process used to explain the hemispheric dichotomy is that of primary crustal fractionation. This process would have been associated with the formation of the Martian core, which took place immediately after planetary accretion. Nevertheless, such an early origin of the hemispheric dichotomy is challenged by the fact that only minor magnetic anomalies have been detected in the northern plains. A model for a mantle plume origin for the hemispheric dichotomy. Single plume mantle convection generates new crust in southern hemisphere with alternating bands of normal and reversed remanent magnetism, adapted from Vita-Finzi & Fortes, 2013. Single plume mantle convection has also been invoked to explain the hemispheric dichotomy. This process would have caused substantial melting and crustal production above a single rising mantle plume in the southern hemisphere, resulting in a thickened crust. It has also been suggested that the formation of a highly viscous melt layer beneath the thickened crust in the southern hemisphere could lead to lithospheric rotation. This may have resulted in the migration of volcanically active areas toward the dichotomy boundary, and the subsequent placement and formation of the Tharsis plateau. The single plume hypothesis is also used to explain the presence of magnetic anomalies in the southern hemisphere, and the lack thereof in the northern hemisphere. = Exogenic origins = Exogenic hypotheses involve one or more large impacts as being responsible for the lowering of the northern plains. Although a multiple-impact origin has been proposed, it would have required an improbable preferential bombardment of the northern hemisphere. It is also unlikely that multiple impacts would have been able to strip ejecta from the northern hemisphere, and uniformly strip the crust to a relatively consistent depth of 3 km. Mapping of the northern plains and the dichotomy boundary shows that the crustal dichotomy is elliptical in shape. This suggests that formation of the northern plains was caused by a single oblique mega-impact. This hypothesis is in agreement with numerical models of impacts in the 30-60¬∞ range, which are shown to produce elliptical boundary basins similar to the structure identified on Mars. Demagnetization resulting from the high heat associated with such an impact can also serve to explain the apparent lack of magnetic anomalies in the northern plains. It also explains the younger surface age of the northern plains, as determined by significantly lesser crater density. Overall, this hypothesis appears to fare better than others that have been proposed.  Tectonic implications of magnetic anomalies  Map of crustal magnetic anomaly distribution on Mars, courtesy of NASA, 2005. The southern highlands of Mars display zones of intense crustal magnetization. The magnetic anomalies are weak or absent in the vicinity of large impact basins, the northern plains, and in volcanic regions, indicating that magnetization in these areas have been erased by thermal events. The presence of magnetic anomalies on Mars suggests that the planet maintained an intrinsic magnetic field early on in its history. The anomalies are linear in shape and of alternating polarity, which some authors have interpreted as a sequence of reversals and a process akin to seafloor spreading. The stripes are ten times wider than those found on Earth, indicating faster spreading or slower reversal rates. Although no spreading center has been identified, a map of the magnetic anomalies on Mars reveals that the lineations are concentric to the south pole. = Mantle plume origin = A process similar to seafloor spreading has been proposed to explain the presence of the concentric stripes around the Martian south pole. The process is that of a single large mantle plume rising in one hemisphere and downwelling in the opposite hemisphere. In such a process, new crust produced would be emplaced in concentric circles spreading radially from a single upwelling point, consistent with the pattern observed on Mars. This process has also been invoked to help explain the Martian hemispheric dichotomy. = Dike intrusion origin = An alternative hypothesis claims that the magnetic anomalies on Mars are the result of successive dike intrusions due to lithospheric extension. As each dike intrusion cools, it would acquire thermoremanent magnetization from the planet's magnetic field. Successive dikes would be magnetized in the same direction, until the magnetic field reverses its polarity, resulting in the subsequent intrusions recording the opposite direction. These periodic reversals would require that the dike intrusions migrate over time. = Accretion of terranes = Another study assumes a process of crustal convergence instead of generation, arguing that the magnetic lineations on Mars formed at a convergent plate margin through collision and accretion of terranes. This hypothesis suggests that the magnetic lineations on Mars are analogous to the banded magnetic anomalies in the North American Cordillera on Earth. These terrestrial anomalies are of similar geometry and size as those detected on Mars, with widths of 100‚Äì200 km.  Tectonic implications of Valles Marineris  Satellite imagery of the Valles Marineris trough system, showing an interpreted large scale strike-slip fault system running along its length. Relative fault motion is suggested in part by the offset rim of an old impact basin. Image modified from NASA/MOLA Science Team. Recent research claims to have found the first strong evidence for a plate tectonic boundary on Mars. The discovery refers to a large-scale (>2000 km in length and >150 km in slip) and quite narrow (<50 km wide) strike-slip fault zone in the Valles Marineris trough system, referred to as the Ius-Melas-Coprates fault zone (Fig. 7). The Valles Marineris trough system, which is over 4000 km long, 600 km wide, and up to 7 km deep, would, if located on Earth, extend all the way across North America. The study indicates that the Ius-Melas-Coprates fault zone is a left-slip transtensional system similar to that of the Dead Sea fault zone on Earth. The magnitude of displacement across the fault zone is estimated to be 150‚Äì160 km, as indicated by the offset rim of an old impact basin. If normalizing the magnitude of the slip to the surface area of the planet, the Ius-Melas-Coprates fault zone has a displacement value significantly larger than that of the Dead Sea fault, and slightly larger than that of the San Andreas fault. The lack of significant deformation on both sides of the Ius-Melas-Coprates fault zone over a distance of 500 km suggests that the regions bounded by the fault behave as rigid blocks. This evidence essentially points to a large strike-slip system at a plate boundary, in terrestrial terms known as a transform fault.

The fruit is small in size, hearty with a \\"violet colour\\", and is renowned for its superior oil which is low in acidity. The latter is generally attributed to the poor quality alkaline soil found on the Maltese Islands. As an indigenous olive cultivar, the Bidni has developed a unique DNA profile, and is believed to be among the most ancient species on the island, triggering local authorities to declare some of these ancient trees as \\"national monuments\\", and as having an \\"Antiquarian Importance\\", a status which is enjoyed by only a handful of other species. Etymology According to the \\"Maltese-English Dictionary\\", the word \\"Bidni\\" is derived from \\"badan\\", which means \\"corpulent\\", \\"robust\\", \\"to grow stout\\". Bidni (\\"≈ºebbuƒ°\\", olive), is a \\"large olive tree producing very small olives\\". Therefore, the tree is called Bidni because it is \\"corpulent\\". This contradicts several online sources that suggest that the word Bidni originated from the rural hamlet of Bidnija, or that the word means \\"hunchback\\" in the Maltese language. Characteristics In a landmark publication entitled, \\"Cultivation and Diseases of Fruit Trees in the Maltese Islands\\", John Borg (1922), Professor of Natural History, Superintendent of Agriculture, and founder of the Government's Experimental Farm at Gƒßammieri, described the Bitni as follows: Borg's work, published in 1922 Decades later, the Bitni's disease resistant qualities still baffle scientists. Described by the Olive Oil Times as a \\"peculiar local variety\\", reports seem to suggest that abnormally high levels of oleuropein, a natural antibiotic produced by the tree to protect its fruit and leaves, may be behind this remarkable characteristic. The Bitni's oil has been described as \\"spicy\\" and \\"peppery\\", containing \\"elevated Polyphenols\\", a characteristic which differentiates it from other oils. Once fully established, fruit is produced in abundance, up to 60 kilos per tree. Protection An ancient Bidni olive tree The antiquity of Malta's ancient Bidni olive trees has been confirmed through carbon dating. The Bidni olive trees, which have been found to date back to the 1st century A.D., have been protected since 1933, and are also listed in UNESCO's Database of National Cultural Heritage Laws. In 2011, after recognising their historical and landscape value, and in recognition of the fact that \\"only 20 trees remain from 40 at the beginning of the 20th century\\", local authorities declared the ancient Bidni olive grove at Bidnija as a Tree Protected Area, under the provisions of a regulation made in 2011. These highly protected Bidni olive trees, measuring between five and eight metres in height, still bear fruit. Although their fruit is too small for harvesting, the ancient Bidni trees are often revered by visitors. Other Bidni olive trees in the vicinity can be found in the private grounds of Qannotta Castle in Wardija. Since the Government of Malta has recognised the olive tree as forming an integral part of the traditional landscape, heavy pruning, felling, and uprooting of olive trees, including that of the Bidni variety, is subject to a permit from the relevant authorities. Although the Bidni olive has no PDO status, there are a number of initiatives, which include studies on its genetic composition, to attain this certification. Apart from legally protecting its name, this status of authenticity is typically used by marketing professionals to gain a competitive advantage at both European and international markets. Revival In January 2006, the Project for the Revival of the Indigenous Maltese Olive (PRIMO), was launched. Apart from reviving indigenous cultivars, such as the Bidni, one of the aims of this project was to substantially increase production levels in a bid to obtain the much coveted PDO status. As a direct result of PRIMO, some 30,000 Bidni olive trees were grafted and planted, thereby setting the necessary groundwork for the creation of a niche industry. The methodology behind this process consisted of several steps. After olive pips were collected from the ancient Bidni olive grove of Bidnija, these were then sowed at the Government of Malta's Experimental Farm in Gƒßammieri and left to germinate for use as rootstock. Once the rootstocks were viable, cuttings were then taken from the millennia-old Bidni olive trees and carefully grafted to the rootstocks. Efforts to plant more Bidni olive trees are ongoing. Gastronomy Crushed Bidni olives in garlic-infused extra virgin olive oil The Maltese use their olive oil quite generously. In 2012, they ranked 8th in the world in per capita olive oil consumption. With olive oil processing equipment dating back to the Roman Empire, and possibly even before this period, the consumption of oil has since become an integral part of the Maltese diet. For instance, in 1804, French writer Louis de Boisgelin noted that, \\"a clove of garlic, or an onion, anchovies dipped in oil, and salted fish\\", was the \\"usual diet\\" of the Maltese. Nowadays, the use of oil in Maltese cuisine is still predominant. The popular Maltese snack \\"ƒßob≈º bi≈º-≈ºejt\\", which literally translates to \\"bread with oil\\", is testimony to this. Although the Bidni is mostly known for its superior oil, the small fruit can also be enjoyed as a table olive. One popular method is to crush Bidni olives in garlic-infused extra virgin olive oil, and then eat them with Maltese bread. Another method is to gently fry Bidni olives after preserving them in brine, and then serve them with seasonal herbs such as parsley or mint. The leaves of the Bidni tree have also been used to make tea which is believed to lower high blood pressure. This ancient remedy is \\"still used in rural communities in Malta\\".

Their mission is to save lives, protect health and increase prosperity in areas where disease transmitted by insects is endemic. Formation and Organisational Structure The Innovative Vector Control Consortium (IVCC) is a not-for-profit public-private partnership that was established in 2005. IVCC is registered as a charity in the UK. IVCC was founded in 2005, through a grant to the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. IVCC was founded by LSTM Director and Professor Janet Hemingway. Nick Hamon is the Chief Executive Officer of IVCC . IVCC is headquartered in Liverpool, UK, but also has a registered office and staff in Washington, D.C., USA, as well as staff based in several other countries. The strategy and scope of IVCC is directed by its core team under governance of the Board of Trustees who represent a wide range of expertise. Strategy The IVCC vision is to save lives, protect health and increase prosperity in areas where disease transmitted by insects is endemic. The IVCC mission is to do this by building partnerships that create innovative solutions to prevent the transmission of insect-borne disease. IVCC facilitates the development and delivery of novel and improved vector control tools and solutions to combat the rapidly growing problem of insecticide resistance. The IVCC strategic plan is focused on three key pillars: developing, delivering and enabling. IVCC works with multiple stakeholders to develop and deliver novel public health vector control insecticides and tools to end-users to support the implementation of robust insecticide resistance management plans. This will enable national malaria control programmes to access a strong portfolio of new vector control solutions developed in accordance with stringent target product profiles. Although primarily focused on malaria, IVCC recognises that new tools and products can be effective against a wide range of other vector-borne diseases. Funding IVCC was originally funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with a grant of $50.7 million over five years, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation continues to fund IVCC today. IVCC is also principally funded by UKaid, USAID, Unitaid , The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, The Global Fund and the Australian Government. Partners IVCC has active partnerships with agrochemical companies, non-governmental organisations, governmental organisations and academia. IVCC‚Äôs primary industrial partners include BASF, Bayer, Mitsui, Sumitomo and Syngenta. Additional IVCC partners include Abt Associates, Imperial College London, The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, PATH, PMI, The Global Fund, Tagros, Vestergaard Fransden and Westham. Malaria Eradication IVCC fully supports the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation‚Äôs report ‚ÄòFrom Aspiration to Action‚Äô which sets out a comprehensive and achievable strategy for malaria eradication by 2040. ZERO by 40 is an initiative that works side by side with other malaria-fighting organisations toward the goal of ending the disease for good by the year 2040. For its part, ZERO by 40 focuses on the prevention of malaria through vector control. Founding partners of the initiative include IVCC and key global Crop Protection companies BASF, Bayer, Mitsui, Sumitomo and Syngenta, in conjunction with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. ZERO by 40 is a collaborative effort to manage and optimise current resources and innovate new vector control tools to help eradicate malaria. Successes IVCC has made great strides towards achieving its mission and has recorded many key accomplishments to date. A sample of these accomplishments include: *Evaluation of over 4.5 million compounds for potential use as public health insecticides leading to six classes of novel active ingredients identified for possible development. *Forged partnerships to establish African trial sites and new insectaries to provide industry standard testing. *Developed diagnostic system for malarial insecticide resistance detection and implemented within disease control programs in Africa. *Launched two new long- lasting indoor residual spray formulations to expand the range of vector control tools for challenging malarial insecticide resistance. *Delivery of disease data management system software to national control programs. *Launched insecticide quantification kits to monitor spray program implementation. *Facilitated the first African vector control field trial site to achieve good laboratory practice (GLP) certification. Six other African vector control field trial site facilities expected to achieve GLP certification by the end of 2018. *Collaborated with BASF to develop the first new class of public health insecticide for malaria prevention in over 30 years. Interceptor¬Æ G2 is a LLIN that received an interim recommendation from WHO in June 2017. *Led a US $65.1 million initiative to support countries in obtaining new and effective insecticides at lower prices to spray walls in homes and fight growing insecticide resistance.

It is located 73 km from Rishikesh on the Rishikesh‚ÄìBadrinath highway. Constructed in the Deula style, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Raghunathji and his consort Lakshmi as Sita. The temple was originally believed to have been established by Adi Shankara during the 8th century, with later expansions by the Garhwal Kingdom. The temple is located uphill on the confluence of the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi rivers, which becomes River Ganga subsequently. Raghunathji is believed to have performed penance at this place to relieve himself of the curse committed by killing Ravana. The temple is maintained and administered by the Uttarakhand Tourism Development Board of the Government of Uttarakhand. Its believed that the mythical river Saraswati flows directly under the deity at the temple. At times there is a small pool of water near the deity. Legend Image of the temple on the hill As per Hindu legend, the temple is associated with the times of Ramayana. Raghunathji (Rama, an avatar of Vishnu) is believed to performed penance at this place to relieve himself off the curse committed by killing Ravana, a Brahmin demon king. Brahma, the Hindu god of creation, is once believed to have performed penance at this place and the place came to be known as Prayaga, meaning the best place to do penance. As per the same legend, the Vataka tree (Banyan tree) in the place would withstand all earthly disasters and would remain through ages. Vishnu is believed to reside in the leaves of the tree. The Pandavas performed penance at this place before the Mahabharat war. Sage Bharadwaja is also believed to have performed penance at this place and became of the seven sacred sages, the Saptarishis. This is the place where Raghunathji (Lord Ram) performed penance after killing Ravana as narrated in The Ramayana Raghunathji‚Äôs place of penance Architecture Raghunathji temple is located in Devprayag, a town in Tehri Garhwal district in the North Indian state of Uttarakhand. It is located from Rishikesh on the Rishikesh - Badarinath highway in the lower Himalayas, above sea level. It is located on the confluence of Alaknanda - Bhagirathi river, above the sea level. The temple has a single precinct and all the shrines are enclosed in an enclosures. There are a number of smaller shrines in the temple for Badrinath, Adi Shankara, Shiva, Sita and Hanuman around the central shrine. The central shrine houses the image of Raghunathji, a granite image in standing posture. The central shrine has a Deula, the conical roof over the sanctum. Stone steps leading to the Raghunathji Temple from the Sangam Ghat History Image of Adi Shankara, who is believed to have established the temple The temple is originally in existence from the 10th century. The temple was originally believed to have been established by Adi Shankara during the 8th century, with later expansions by the Garhwal Kingdom. Garhwal (also the ruling dynasty), the region in Himalayas, where the temple is located, is referred with the name for the first time in a copper plate inscription in the temple from the period of Raja Man Shah during 1610.Rawat 2002, p. 18 The temple received contributions from other rulers of the dynasty like Sahaj Pal, who donated a bell to the temple in 1551, as indicated by the inscriptions in the temple. Man Shah, the other ruler of the dynasty made contributions and is indicted in the inscriptions from 1610 CE.Rawat 2002, p. 27 The region was ruled by Raja Prithvi Pat Shah as seen from the inscriptions in the door and doorways in the temple dated to 1664.Rawat 2002, p. 49 King Jai Kirthi Shah who ruled the region during 1780, ended his life in the temple as he was betrayed by his courtsmen.Rawat 2002, p. 60 It was damaged during an earthquake during 1893 and was built by the local king subsequently. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Uttarakhand Tourism Development Board of the Government of Uttarakhand. Religious significance Devaprayag, the confluence where the temple is located, is counted out as one of the five famous confluences of Ganga in the Himalayas, called Panch Prayag. These are centres of great religious influence and prominent pilgrimage centres.Rawat 2002, p. 13 The temple finds mention in four of the eighteen sacred Puranas, namely the Padma Purana, Matsya Purana, Kurma Purana and Agni Purana. The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th‚Äì9th century Vaishnava canon, by Peyazhwar, Nammazhwar, Thirumangai Azhwar and Thirumalisai Alvar. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. The temple along with Devprayag was originally a larger pilgrimage centre before the 19th century. On account of increased connectivity for Badrinath Temple in modern times, the temple has turned into a secondary pilgrimage centre. It is believed that Adi Shankara, the proponent of Advaita philosophy established the temple. A shrine is dedicated to him in the temple.

It was intended to be mounted under the fuselage of airplanes such as the Dornier Do 217 or the Junkers Ju 288 to engage ships of the Royal Navy.  Development  Based on ideas from the First World War, in 1939 the German government ordered the development of a recoilless rifle capable of engaging armored naval targets. Rheinmetall- Borsig began the development of Ger√§t 104 (Device 104), it was given the code name \\"M√ºnchhausen\\" at a later time. It is believed that the absence of recoil of this type of gun allowed for installation on an aircraft. = Planned use = The Ger√§t 104 was planned to be mounted on airplanes for attacking naval targets in a manner as follows; upon arriving to the zone of operation, the aircraft equipped with the Ger√§t 104 would initiate a dive with an angle of attack between 50¬∞ and 80¬∞ from the horizontal, firing at an altitude between 6,000 and 2, 000 meters. The flight time of the projectile could range from 16.0 seconds for a shot from an altitude of 6,000 meters at a 50¬∞ angle to 4.4 seconds for a shot from 2000 meters at an 80¬∞ angle. The purpose of such a high angle of attack was likely to allow the projectile to penetrate the ship's deck, where the ship's armor, if there was any, would have been much thinner than the armor on its sides. Prior to impact, the velocity of the projectile was projected to range between 449 and 468 m/s (1,616 to 1,674 km/h). = Trials = After calculations had verified that the designed rifle would have effectively no recoil, preliminary tests were carried out. The cannon was mounted on a carriage that was fixed to the fuselage of a Dornier Do 217 in 2 places: under the cockpit and on the fuselage behind the wings. The first test was conducted on 9 September 1940; during this test the explosive propellant used was weaker than originally planned, yet the tail of the Dornier Do 217 still experienced deformations due to the blast waves caused by the explosive backblast of the gun. These deteriorations occurred in two particular instances; the first due to a direct impact of the blast wave on the fuselage, and the second to the reflection of the blast wave from the ground. The trials continued through 1941 without reaching a solution for the fuselage damage caused by firing. Due to this issue and the decreased need for this project due to development of air-to-ground rockets, the project was definitively abandoned without any additional in-air tests being performed as the damage caused by the cannon to the aircraft was considered too critical to warrant further pursuit.  Specifications  = Ger√§t 104a = The technical data of the rifle are as follows: * Caliber: 355.6 mm * Muzzle velocity: 300 m/s * Projectile mass: 700 kg * Maximum gas pressure: 2100 kg/cm2 * Average gas pressure: 1117 kg/cm2 * Empty mass of rifle: 2780 kg * Mass of cartridge: 1457 kg * Loaded mass of rifle: 4237 kg Notes and references Category:Military equipment of World War II Category:World War II artillery of Germany Category:Recoilless rifles Category:Rheinmetall ","title":"Sonderger√§t SG104 &quot;M√ºnchhausen&quot;"},{"id":"50426594","text":"Coming from the Mill is a painting by British painter Laurence Stephen Lowry from 1930.

Description  The dimensions of the painting are 75 √ó 105 cm. It was purchased for the collection of the Ateneum in 1869. A number of people listen to a kantele playing. This includes the mistress of the house, young women and their children. Leaning in the corner is a pipe-smoking soldier. The environment is simple, related to their everyday chores, and lit by a daylit window. The work reflects an idealized vision of the Finnish nation and its values.  Analysis  Kreeta Haapasalo was a well-known folk musician who in periods of famine in the 1860s fed a family by traveling as a kantele player, singing poetry. It brought her great popularity at a time of great interest in the roots of the Finnish people. Haapasalo was seen at the time as part of an ancient tradition as an interpreter of the Kalevala, through which she was able to get in touch with genuine Finnish culture. Robert Ekman, the painter, was interested in the origins of Finnish culture. Ekman studied at the Stockholm Academy of Art. He was interested in historical development and the public life of the Finnish people. His genre paintings depicting it were well received. He returned to Finland on a permanent basis, after an Italian and French tour in 1845, after which he taught until his death in Turku drawing school, which he established in the following year.

It was painted in 1860. Though short, Holmberg's career helped develop Finnish landscape painting. He combined the traditional landscape painting techniques of the atelier with the modern outdoor en plein air landscape. In the painting, a horse-drawn wagon is travelling along a rolling country road through a pine forest in Tavastia. The painting depicts the carriage from the rear on a hot day. Trees and vegetation are painted with accuracy and the perspective of the image from the fresh wheel marks in the dirt creates an impression of movement. One can almost smell the dust and pine needles under the wheels. In 1853, Holmberg was the first Finnish artist to study in D√ºsseldorf. From the surviving sketches, it seems Holmberg's Road in H√§me was probably painted in the Tampere region.

There is a temple dedicated to Goddess Amba in southwest of the Atkot. History Atkot is famous in local legends as having been founded by the celebrated Lakho Phulani, who fell fighting against Solanki king Mulraj of Anhilwad Patan within the lands of Atkot. Lakho's paliyo or funeral monument stands here to this day. Lakho was the son of Raja Phul of Kerakot in Vagad states and is said to have been born when his father was absent warring against Mulraj. On the day that Lakho was born Atkot his father is said to have made a foray as far as Patan and to have plundered a few shops, whence the couplet:The Gujarati runs: Je Di Lakho Janamiya Dharpat Kandhara; Te Di Pirana Patanja Kota Lota Kara. When Lakho grew up he was so daring and headstrong that his father found it difficult to keep him under control, and when he remonstrated with him regarding his conduct, Lakho crossed over the Rann of Kutch into Kathiawar, and stayed for some time in the neighbourhood of Than where he founded the village of Lakhamanchi. Here he stayed for a year or two, and during this time he made the acquaintance of Ra Graharipu of Junagadh who conceived a great friendship for him and invited him to populate Atkot. This Lakho did, and took up his residence there. Atkot had at first eight separate suburbs, and hence was named Atkot. Lakho Phulani is said to have introduced the grain called bajri, Pearl millet, to Kathiawar from a distant eastern country where he had gone on a foray. In that country the grain is said to have been called khardhan. There is a bardic couplet about this:The Gujardti runs : Balihari tari bajra, jena lamba pan; Ghode pankho aaviyo, buddha thaya javan. Lakho is said to have had an amour with a celebrated songstress called Dayi Dumri, about whom many legends are told. She is said to have lived in a house on the opposite side of the river. The spot is known to this day as Dayi Dumri's dhar or ridge. Lakho's raids however into Gujarat excited the wrath of Mulraj Solanki, who had also a quarrel with Ra Graharipu, the Chudasama Rao of Junagadh. But they were such fast friends and so renowned for prowess, that Mulraj hesitated to attack them. At last however Lakho alienated his sister's son Rakhayat, who went over to Mulraj and offered to conduct his forces to Atkot. Mulraj accepted the offer, and a great battle was fought in which Lakho was slain. The honour of slaying Lakho is attributed by some to Mulraj himself and by some to Rakhayat. But the popular belief is that Pabji Rathod received the reward but that Lakho actually fell by the hand of Dhabal Solanki. And thus the bardic couplet:The Gujarati runs : Dhabale Lakho mariyo, Pabal pasayo ; Madhunlaye paarakho, gaando Gujjar raayo. Atkot then fell waste, but afterwards was repopulated by Ahirs. Then it fell under the Khumans of Kherdi State and afterwards formed a crown village of the Muslim domain of Sorath. On the extinction of the Muslim power it was conquered by the Lakhani Khachars and was wrested from them by the Jam of Navanagar State in the later part of the eighteenth century. The village was half surrounded by a fort, but it has been left unfinished. It was acquired by the Jam from the Kathi family of Jasdan State. Temples Other temples in village include Loyan Mata temple, Swaminarayan Temple and Sati temple.

Edelfelt was at this time already fairly well known by the Paris art world having lived there for ten years. It is surprising that among his works, there are no other large Paris-themed works.

The poem is composed both in metrical and non-metrical verse and centres on Nala, a character from the Mahabharata who metamorphosed into Bahuka. It is an acclaimed poem of Gujarati literature written in Sanskrit-styled figurative language. The poem was selected for the Ushnas Prize (1982‚Äì83) by the Gujarati Sahitya Parishad.  Background and publication history  Chinu Modi Chinu Modi began writing Bahuk in 1971. He suspended work between 1979 and 1981, on receiving a creative fellowship from the Department of Culture in Delhi, before going on to complete the poem in October 1982. Bahuk was published in book form in January 1983 by Adarsh Publication, Ahmedabad, and reprinted in 1999. A third edition, including critical articles, was published in October 2014.  Characters  * Nala, the king of Nishadnagar, who lost his empire to his brother Pushkara in a bet. * Damayanti, princess of the Vidarbha Kingdom and wife of Nala. * Brihadashwa, a sage. During his exile, Pandava king Yudhishthira asked Brihadashwa, \\"Is there any other emperor in this wood who is unfortunate as me?\\". At that time, Brihadashwa consoled him by narrating the story of Nala and Damayanti. In China Modi's poem, the sage Brihadashwa comes into his own as an independent character and observer.  Theme  The subject of the poem is the story of Nala and Damayanti from chapter 27 chapter of the Vana Parva, third parva (book) of the Mahabharata. The poem's central theme is the psyche and subtle emotions of Nala, and of his wife Damayanti. After losing his empire to his brother Pushkara in a bet, Nala spends three days and nights outside his city, Nishadnagar, with Damayanti, before going into the forest. Cut off from his city, Nala feels extreme loneliness. The poem depicts the dissolution of his personality during these three days and nights.  Structure and techniques  The poem is divided into three sarga (cantos). The first contains 15 chapters, the second 13 chapters, and the third 22 chapters. The three characters do not communicate with each other but speak in independent monologues. The chronological order of narrator monologues is as follows: * Sarga 1 : Brihadashwa, Nala, Damayanti * Sarga 2 : Brihadashwa, Nala, Damayanti * Sarga 3 : Damayanti, Brihadashwa, Nala The first and second sargas are composed in non-metrical verse. The third is composed in accordance with the rules of Sanskrit-vritta (Sanskrit prosody) and Matra-vritta, including Prithvi, Vasantatilka, Mandakranta, Shikhrini, Chopai and Katav. The poem is structured using Sanskrit-styled and figurative language. The narrative comprises long monologues from the three characters, Nala, Damayanti, and Brihadashwa. Brihadashwa and Damayanti's monologues centre alternately on Nala and his psyche, reflecting the affection they hold for Nala. The poet reinterprets the two accounts in the original story, \\"Karkotaka dankh\\" (\\"The sting of Karkotaka\\") and \\"Matsya Sajivan Prasang\\". In the original story, a bite from the snake Karkotaka transforms Nala into Bahuka. In the poem, Chinu Modi describes Nala's metamorphosis into Bahuka as being caused by natural phenomena.  Synopsis  = Sarga 1 = The first sarga (canto) begins with three visions of Brihadashwa: the arrival of victorious Pushkara in the town Nishadanagar; the citizens' fear at his arrival; and victorious Pushkara's emotions and Nala's numbness. There follows a description of Nala's despair at being cut off from his city. The sarga concludes with Damayanti's thoughts and feelings on Nala's situation. = Sarga 2 = The second sarga begins with Brihadashwa's address to the Vrukharaj (a banyan tree) and some other elements of nature at the border of Nishadanagar concerning Nala's mental state. Nala's monologue follows, reflecting his stillness, his passivity and lifelessness, and his growing consciousness of these things. Finally, Damayanti's monologue reveals her own state of mind in certain lines, with the remainder concerning Nala. Damayanti addresses Nala, attempting to rouse him from his numbed state. The entire monologue uses the technique of Indication. = Sarga 3 = Nala leaving Damayanthi while she is sleeping; painting by upright=0.8 The third sarga begins with Damayanti‚Äôs monologue describing Nala‚Äôs mental state through the symbol of the banyan tree Vruksharaj and other elements of nature. Damayanti attempts to convince Nala to accept his new situation. Brihadashva‚Äôs monologue follows, describing Nala's situation using natural imagery such as darkness and the forest. At the beginning of the final monologue, by Nala, Nala finds a golden, fleshy bird. Hungry, he finds the bird fit to eat. This is the point at which his transformation into Bahuka commences. He makes a snare out of his only cloth to catch the bird, but it flies away carrying the cloth. Nala is left naked and feels his individuality dissolving, with a deep sense of grief. Finally, Nala turns into Bahuka, not as a result of the snake Karkotaka's bite as in the original story in the Mahabharata, but through the sting of loneliness. He leaves Damayanti and wanders away into the forest. The episode that begins with Nala‚Äôs desire to kill the bird closes with Nala leaving Damayanti, revealing his uglier side. The Nala of the poem is written as a displaced person.  Award  The book was awarded the Ushnas Prize (1982‚Äì83) by the Gujarati Sahitya Parishad (Gujarati Literary Council).  Critical response  The poem has been critically acclaimed by several Gujarati authors. Harivallabh Bhayani noted that Chinu Modi has broken new ground in modern Gujarati long narrative poetry (Khandakavya) with his attempts at narrative poems. Chandrakant Topiwala noted, \\"In Gujarati literature, poets like Ravji Patel, and Raghuvir Chaudhari have written poem on separation from village when they moved from village to city. But here for the first time, Chinu Modi has grabbed the opportunity to writing on separation from the city as the lead character is separated from the city and moving to woods\\". In this, he has described the pain of personal separation in a modern context. However, in one article Pramodkumar Patel questioned the psychological role and the truthfulness and authenticity of the emotions of the character Damayanti. He noted that Damayanti's behavior runs counter to reality in some instances in the poem.  Translation and adaptation  Chinu Modi adapted the poem as two-act Gujarati play in 1991. In the production, Himanshu Trivedi played the role of Nala and Asma Dalal played Damayanti. The poem was translated into Hindi by Kavita Sharma 'Jadli' in 2017.

Analysis  The icon was painted in the middle of the 15th century and partially repainted in the early 17th century. However, according to legend, it was a gift from the Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos to Grand Duke Vytautas on the occasion of his baptism. On 4 September 1718, Pope Clement XI sent Bishop Konstanty Kazimierz Brzostowski for the canonical coronation of the venerated image. It was the second icon of the Virgin crowned with papal crowns on the territory of the Commonwealth. Stefan Czarniecki, King Jan Kazimierz and Jan III Sobieski prayed before the icon.  Description  Icon on the main altar The icon depicts the Virgin Mary, with her right hand supporting baby Jesus sitting on her lap, while her left holds a branch with three flowers. Gothic and Renaissance elements are visible in the icon. It combines old with new iconography, inspired by European art forms. The icon, which Lithuanian researchers believe is from Belarus, is determined by a bright light color, soft shapes and the specificity of facial features. The depiction of individual traits is so specific, and the sensitivity of the living body texture is so sincere, that the image is more like a portrait than an icon.

He was involved in various plots to overthrow Ottoman rule in the northern regions of Epirus.. For many years, Papagiannis attempted to convince various rulers of Western Europe to lend him military support for an uprising against the Ottoman Empire. Early life Papagiannis was born in Argyrocastro, Epirus region, Ottoman Empire (modern Gjirokast√´r, southern Albania) to a local Greek family. He was one of the representatives of the town's Greek community. Papagiannis was one of the most active merchants in his homeland as well as in the nearby Venetian possessions on the Ionian coast.. Plans to trigger Western intervention Papagiannis organized a rebellion against Ottoman rule after the Battle of Lepanto (1571), where the Ottoman fleet was defeated by the Holy League. He initiated correspondence with various Western European rulers, where he propagated that his compatriots were eager to cast off Ottoman rule. He also claimed that a victory could be easily achieved with the creation of an anti-Ottoman alliance with the local Greek subjects.. In 1572, after securing the support of various local Orthodox metropolitan bishops, especially Joachim of Ohrid, he moved to Venice. There he negotiated with Doge Sebastiano Venier for the possibility of Venetian involvement in the revolt.. In February‚ÄìApril 1572, a Venetian fleet of twelve galleys was ready to attack the coastal region of Delvine. However, Venier recalled the attack order, in fear that his manpower was not enough for a successful assault. The Venetian activity was limited to a minor raid against the coastal village of Mazaraki on the Ionian coast.. Nevertheless, Venice ultimately decided to make peace with the Ottomans and Papagiannis's proposals were dismissed. The following year, Papagiannis, together with another local noble from Argyrocastro, Panos Kestolikos, moved to Naples and asked the Spaniards to support their revolutionary plan. They also discussed the possibility of an anti-Ottoman armed struggle with the head of the Holy League, John of Austria, \\"as Greek representatives of enslaved Greece and Albania\\".. John was eager to provide the necessary support for an immediate revolt,. but the Spanish dismissed the plans. They provided only a limited amount of money to Papagiannis in exchange for remaining in their service as an agent. After the dissolution of the Holy League, both Papagiannis and Kestolikos approached Phillip II of Spain (r. 1554‚Äì1558). In 1574, Papagiannis was in Ottoman-controlled Epirus to prepare another planned revolt.. The following year, he was located in Himara, on the Ionian coast, together with Basque spy Antonio de Echavarri, in order to determine if the situation was ripe for that purpose.. Later, in 1577, he established contacts with Spanish spy Martin de Acuna in Constantinople.. Later life After several unsuccessful attempts to trigger Western intervention against the Ottoman Empire and agitating for the liberation of the northern part of Epirus, Papagiannis's plans were exposed to the Ottomans. He escaped to Western Europe,. but his property was confiscated by the Ottoman authorities and his wife and children were arrested and jailed.. The local rural communities were also subjected to Ottoman punishment, even those that were not involved with the preparations. Papagiannis died between 1580 and 1596.. His daughter, Argyro, moved to Venice where she received a monthly allowance from the Venetian Republic.. The subsequent revolt of Himara brought another wave of anti-Ottoman activity in 1596..

Armed with four guns, the ships were much larger and more powerfully-armed than their predecessors. Completed in 1907, she was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron (). During World War I, Victor Hugo escorted convoys as well as the capital ships of the French fleet. The ship participated in the blockade of the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the Adriatic Sea until 1917 when she was reduced to reserve. Four years later, the cruiser was reactivated; she served in the Far East in 1922‚Äì1923 and went back into reserve upon her return. Victor Hugo was sold for scrap in 1930. Description Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1923 The L√©on Gambetta-class ships were designed as enlarged and more powerful versions of the armored cruisers. Victor Hugo, the last ship to be built, was slightly longer than her sister ships and and measured overall, with a beam of and a draft of . The sisters were designed to displace at normal load. Their crew normally numbered 26 officers and 708 enlisted men, or 30 officers and 749 men when serving as a flagship.Jordan & Caresse, p. 143 The ships had three vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one propeller shaft. Each of the sisters used a different model of water-tube boiler and Victor Hugo was fitted with 28 Belleville boilers. The engines were rated at a total of to reach their designed speed of . During her sea trials on 2 March 1907, Victor Hugo reached from . The cruisers carried enough coal to give them a range of at a speed of .Jordan & Caresse, pp. 143, 157‚Äì158, 160 The main battery of the L√©on Gambetta class consisted of four 194-millimeter Mod√®le 1893‚Äì1896 guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure. Their secondary armament comprised sixteen Mod√®le 1893‚Äì1896M guns. Twelve of these were in three twin-gun turrets on each broadside and the remaining four guns were in casemates in the hull.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 306 Unlike her sisters, Victor Hugo was fitted with twenty-four Canon de 47 mm mod√®le 1902 guns for defense against torpedo boat.Silverstone, p. 80 She was also armed with two submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside, and could carry 20 naval mines.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 145, 150‚Äì151 The cruisers' waterline armor belt ranged in thickness from and the main-gun turrets were protected by armor thick. Their deck armor was thick. The front and side sides of the conning tower consisted of armor plates. Construction and career Named after the novelist Victor Hugo, Jean Marie Antoine de Lanessan, Minister of the Navy, ordered the Arsenal de Toulon to begin work on the ship on 11 March 1901 in compliance with the recently passed Naval Law (). The order was transferred to the Arsenal de Lorient on 3 June 1902 even though that shipyard was committed to building two of the preceding armored cruisers. Coupled with the need to transport the assembled materials to Lorient, the change delayed her keel laying until 2 March 1903. Victor Hugo was launched on 30 March 1904 and began her sea trials on 15 January 1907. The cruiser was commissioned () on 16 April. Her construction cost 30,748,300 francs.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 139‚Äì141, 160, 213 On 8 May Victor Hugo departed Lorient for Jamestown, Virginia, to participate in the Jamestown Exposition, together with the armored cruiser and the protected cruiser . By 20 May they were visiting New York City; the ships returned to Jamestown on 31 May where they participated in the naval review presided over by President Theodore Roosevelt on 10 June. Upon her return to France later that month, Victor Hugo was assigned to the Light Squadron () of the Mediterranean Squadron. On 5 October 1909, the French Navy reorganized its forces and redesignated the Mediterranean Squadron as the 1st Squadron () and the Light Squadron became the 1st Light Division ( (DL)). The ship was assigned to the 2nd DL of the 1st Squadron on 4 April 1911 with her sisters, although she was reduced to reserve later in the year. Victor Hugo had been reactivated by 10 February 1912 when she was reassigned to the 2nd DL.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 160, 210‚Äì211; Sieche, pp. 150, 155, 157 After the Agadir Crisis of 1911, the French and British governments agreed in 1912 that the Royal Navy would defend the northern French coast and the French would concentrate their fleet in the Mediterranean and defend British interests there. The French designated the consolidated fleet the 1st Naval Army () and grouped its two DLs into the 1st Light Squadron.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 210, 214 =World War I= When Imperial Germany declared war on France on 3 August 1914, the ship was still assigned to the 2nd DL. The following day the cruisers were part of the escorting force for a troop convoy from Algiers, French Algeria to Metropolitan France. On 13 August Vice Admiral Augustin Bou√© de Lapeyr√®re, commander of Allied forces in the Central Mediterranean, was ordered to begin offensive operations against the Austro-Hungarian fleet in the Adriatic. He decided to break the Austro-Hungarian blockade of the port of Antivari, Montenegro, and to engage any ships operating out of nearby Cattaro. He split his available forces into two groups with the armored cruisers following the Albanian coast and the battleships tracing the Italian coast before cutting across the Adriatic to rendezvous at Antivari on the morning of the 16th. The latter sank the protected cruiser that morning in the Battle of Antivari as the armored cruisers were coming up from the south.Freivogel, pp. 96, 101; Jordan & Caresse, pp. 218, 222, 227 At the end of the month, the French began intermittently escorting single cargo ships to Antivari, usually escorted by the armored cruisers and covered by the main battlefleet. The first of these was on 31 September when four armored cruisers escorted the steamer while the battleships bombarded the defenses of Cattaro. The 2nd DL escorted the cargo ship as it brought long-range artillery pieces to Antivari on 18‚Äì19 September. On the return voyage, they took advantage of the fog to bombard Cattaro before they were forced to withdraw by heavy return fire. The 2nd DL participated in the next sortie into the Adriatic on 17 October, but it was uneventful. During the following mission, begun at the end of October, the 2nd DL raided the island of Lastovo on 2 November and Jules Ferry was narrowly missed by U-5, an Austro-Hungarian U-boat, on the return voyage the following day. The torpedoing of the dreadnought battleship on 21 December brought an end to the sorties into the Adriatic by the battlefleet; henceforth the supply ships were escorted by the armored cruisers or smaller ships. The French also responded by moving their patrol line further south to a line north of the Greek island of Corfu.Freivogel, pp. 98‚Äì100, 117‚Äì122; Halpern, p. 4; Jordan & Caresse, pp. 230‚Äì231 Italy signed the Treaty of London on 26 April 1915, agreeing to declare war on Austro-Hungary. Bou√© de Lapeyr√®re, concerned about a possible pre-emptive attack on the southern Italian ports, temporarily moved all of his armored cruisers, including the three sisters, closer to the Strait of Otranto that day. L√©on Gambetta was torpedoed and sunk by U-5 with heavy loss of life on the 27th. After the sinking, Bou√© de Lapeyr√®re withdrew his armored cruisers even further south to a patrol line running through the Gerogombos lighthouse on the island of Cephalonia. He also ordered that patrols should be made at a speed of , not the leisurely used by L√©on Gambettas late captain. After the Italian declaration of war on 23 May, the French ships withdrew further into the Mediterranean and Ionian Seas with the 2nd DL ultimately basing itself at Alexandria, Egypt, Bizerte, French Tunisia, and British Malta; the division was responsible for patrolling the area between Capo Colonna in southern Italy and the easternmost point of the Greek island of Crete.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 232‚Äì233 At the end of 1915, the French and British decided that the Serbian Army's position in Montenegro and Albania was untenable and that it would have to be evacuated. Victor Hugo helped transfer some of the evacuees from Brindisi, Italy, to Bizerte in early January. The Allies occupied the neutral island of Corfu on 9 January to provide a place for the Serbs to recuperate and to rebuild their army. In March, they occupied the Greek island of Argostoli to serve as a base for the battlefleet while the armored cruisers were based further north at Corfu. The Royal Serbian Army deemed fit for combat in May and the French armored cruisers provided distant cover for the transfer to the Salonica Front until it was completed on 15 June. Shortages of coal and trained manpower hampered most training for the rest of the year and became worse in 1917. As tensions rose between the Allies and the neutral Greek government in early 1917, Victor Hugo and the armored cruiser were tasked to patrol the Gulf of Corinth and prevent any Greek troops from moving from their positions in the Peloponnese across the bridge over the Corinth Canal on 28 April to interfere with Allied operations in Athens. The 2nd DL landed a company of Senegalese troops on 11 June and reinforced them with machine-gun armed sailors until King Constantine I abdicated the following day and a pro-Allied government was installed. On 12 August, the 2nd DL was disbanded with Victor Hugo reduced to reserve at Bizerte and Jules Ferry was assigned to transport duties for the next year.Freivogel, p. 219; Jordan & Caresse, pp. 238‚Äì240, 243‚Äì245 Victor Hugo was reactivated in 1921 and assigned to the Atlantic Flying Division (). The following year she was transferred to the Far Eastern Division (). Departing on 12 October 1922 with Jules Michelet, they arrived in Saigon, French Indochina, on 19 April 1923. Her service there was uneventful and the ship arrived back in Toulon on 11 July at which time she was placed in reserve. Victor Hugo was stricken from the Navy List on 20 January 1928 and sold for scrap on 26 November 1930.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 253‚Äì254, 259 References Bibliography   Category:L√©on Gambetta-class cruisers Category:Ships built in France Category:1904 ships Category:Victor Hugo Category:World War I cruisers of France ","title":"French cruiser Victor Hugo"},{"id":"50427403","text":"The international date lineIn this article, the convention used is to capitalize \\"Date Line\\" (or \\"International Date Line\\") when it refers to the standard International Date Line, but to use small letters to refer to possible construct(s) under Jewish law. in Judaism is used to demarcate the change of one calendar day to the next in the Jewish calendar. The Jewish calendar defines days as running from sunset to sunset rather than midnight to midnight. So in the context of Judaism, an international date line demarcates when the line of sundown moving across the Earth's surface stops being the sunset ending and starting one day and starts being the sunset ending and starting the following day. However, the conventional International Date Line is a relatively recent geographic and political construct whose exact location has moved from time to time depending on the needs of different interested parties. While it is well-understood why the conventional date line is located in the Pacific Ocean, there are not really objective criteria for its exact placement within the Pacific.See the main article for details. In that light, it cannot be taken for granted that the conventional International Date Line can (or should) be used as a date line under Jewish law. In practice, within Judaism the halakhic date line is similar to, but not necessarily identical with, the conventional Date Line, and the differences can have consequences under religious law. Location of the date line =Theoretical basis for the discussion= Many of the opinions about the halakhic date line are structured as a response to the question of what days someone should observe as Shabbat and Jewish holidays. Shabbat occurs every seven days at any location on earth. It is normally thought to occur on Saturday‚Äîor more precisely, from Friday at sundown to Saturday at nightfall. But if the halakhic date line is not identical to the conventional Date Line, it is possible that what is Saturday with respect to the conventional Date Line is not Saturday with respect to the halakhic date line, at least in some places. There are several opinions regarding where exactly the halakhic date line should be according to Jewish law, and at least one opinion that says that no halakhic date line really exists. which is summarized in English at The International Dateline in Halacha (Star-K)(map), 170 kB 1\\\\. 90 degrees east of Jerusalem. The concept of a halakhic date line is mentioned in the Baal HaMeor, a 12th-century Talmudic commentary,Rabbeinu Zecharya Halevi, Baal Hameor, Tractate Rosh Hashana, 20b which seems to indicate that the day changes in an area where the time is six hours ahead of Jerusalem (90 degrees east of Jerusalem, about 125.2¬∞E, a line now known to run through Australia, the Philippines, China and Russia). This line, which he refers to as the K'tzai Hamizrach (the easternmost line), is used to calculate the day of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. According to some sources it is alluded to in both the Babylonian Talmud (Rosh Hashanah and Eruvin) and in the Jerusalem Talmud. The Kuzari of Yehuda Halevi, also a 12th-century work, seems to agree with this ruling. Later decisors like the Chazon Ish (twentieth century) fundamentally agree with this ruling. However, they recognize practical issues associated with the pure use of a line of longitude for this purpose. As an example, 125.2¬∞E passes directly through Dongfeng Street in Changchun, China.To be precise, at a point 1.11 km east of Xihu Rd. See location on OpenStreetMaps. If this line of longitude were used strictly, people could simply avoid Shabbat altogether by crossing the street. To prevent that, the Chazon Ish rulesThis is rejected by the Brisker Rav (see at page 69), who rules that the use of this meridian is absolute. that the contiguous land masses to the east of that line of longitude are considered secondary (tafel) to the land masses west of that line. As a result, he rules that the date line runs along 125.2¬∞E when over water, but curves around the eastern coast of mainland Asia and Australia. By this view, Russia, China and Australia are west of the date line and observe Shabbat on local Saturday. Japan, New Zealand and Tasmania are east of the date line and should observe Shabbat on local Sunday, as defined by the conventional International Date Line. By this view, the Philippines and Indonesia would have portions west of the line and portions east of the line. 2\\\\. 180 degrees east of Jerusalem. Rabbi Yechiel Michel Tucazinsky ruled that the International Date Line is 180 degrees east of Jerusalem. That would mean that the date line, rather than being near 180¬∞, would be at 144.8¬∞W. By this view, places east of the conventional International Date Line but west of 144.8¬∞W‚ÄîAlaska, Hawaii and a variety of archipelagos in the Pacific‚Äîwould observe Shabbat on the local Friday instead of the local Saturday. It is possible (but not certain) under this view to apply the principal of tafel described above as well. In that event, mainland Alaska would be east of the date line, but the Aleutian Islands would be west of the date line. 3\\\\. Mid-Pacific. A variety of decisors rule that the date line runs in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, close to (but not necessarily the same as) the conventional International Date Line. According to this point of view, all of the major populated areas of the Pacific (such as New Zealand, Japan, Alaska and Hawaii) observe Shabbat on local Saturday (that is, consistent with the conventional International Date Line). Only certain Pacific islands, generally having few or no permanent Jewish residents, might not observe Shabbat on local Saturday. 4\\\\. Following local custom/There is no fixed date line. According to Rabbi Menachem Mendel Kasher, there is no clear tradition or Talmudic source dictating any of the preceding opinions as binding. For that reason, and consistent with a responsum of the Radbaz, Rabbi Kasher starts with the default law that a Jew not knowing the proper day for Shabbat should count days from the last time s/he observed Shabbat, and that every seven days is Shabbat. In his view, established Jewish communities are presumed to have fixed their calendars according to this principle. Therefore, Shabbat in an established community is whatever day the community has established. Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer and Rabbi Zvi Pesach Frank apparently agree with this position. This position does not in and of itself require a formal date line to be established, and Rabbi Kasher does not seem to think that it is necessary to do so. But the de facto result of this position is consistent with the conventional International Date Line, at least anywhere there is an established Jewish community. =Practical rulings= In practice, the conventional International Date Line (or another mid-Pacific line near it) is the de facto date line under Jewish law, at least for established Jewish communities. The communities of Japan,Jewish Community of Japan, Jewish Community of Kansai New Zealand,Canterbury Hebrew Congregation, Auckland Hebrew Congregation Hawaii,Congregation Sof Maarav, Jewish Congregation of Maui and French Polynesia all observe Shabbat on local Saturday (i.e., Friday night until Saturday night). No known Jewish community observes Shabbat on a day other than local Saturday.The one arguable exception is Samoa, which moved from the east side of the International Date Line to the west side around New Year's Day 2012. The Jewish Telegraphic Agency located a single relatively observant Jew living on Samoa, who said at the time that he would follow the lead of local Seventh-Day Adventist churches and light Shabbat candles on Saturday night. (See However, the practice of a single individual may not be sufficient to establish a community practice in Jewish law. However, that practical conclusion is reached in two different ways, resulting in somewhat different practice patterns in each case. Following local custom/There is no fixed date line. As noted above, according to this point of view, Shabbat is simply observed on the date previously established as Shabbat by the local community‚Äîuniformly, local Saturday‚Äîwithout any need for any further observance. This appears to be the default practice for residents of such places as Japan, New Zealand and Hawaii. At minimum, it is difficult to find evidence of other practices by residents of those areas.See, as an anecdotal example, search the page for \\"NZ\\". Establishment of a date line by a majority among three halakhic positions. The travelers' guide of the Star-K kosher supervision service, compiled according to the rulings of its rabbinic administrator, Rabbi Moshe Heinemann, uses the following approach, which is also cited by others. According to this approach, the first three numbered sections above constitute three valid, parallel, halakhic rulings. Shabbat is consequently fully observed on whichever day is consistent with the majority view among those opinions (two out of three). However, out of respect to the minority view of the third ruling, and with an eye toward not desecrating Shabbat, Torah-level prohibitions are to be avoided on the day consistent with the minority view, although that day is otherwise considered a weekday. According to this rule, practice is as follows: * In New Zealand and Japan, the local Saturday is Shabbat according to the majority opinion (sections 2 and 3 above), and it should therefore be fully observed as Shabbat. However, since according to the minority opinion (section 1 above), Shabbat is on the local Sunday, one should not perform any Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions on Sunday. Nevertheless, on Sunday, one should pray the regular weekday prayers, donning tefillin during morning prayers. * In Hawaii and French Polynesia, the local Saturday is Shabbat according to majority opinion (sections 1 and 3 above), and it should therefore be fully observed as Shabbat. However, since according to the minority opinion (section 2 above), Shabbat is on the local Friday, one should not perform any Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions on Friday. Friday prayers are weekday prayers, and preparation for Shabbat must be done with an eye to avoiding Torah-level Shabbat prohibitions. * In principle, a zone of pure doubt exists in approximately the area of 169¬∞W‚Äì177¬∞E, including places like Tonga, Samoa and American Samoa. The rulings of the Mid-Pacific group above are not perfectly consistent in this area, so there is no possibility of an unambiguous \\"two out of three\\" consensus here. Rabbi Dovid Heber of the Star-K suggests that in such locations one might need to observe Shabbat fully for two days every week. The Star-K's international kosher supervision staff follows this approach, and there is evidence that some other travelers also do. Authorities suggesting this approach often advise travelers to avoid the zone of doubt entirely near weekends, or to consult with a competent rabbinical authority directly. Crossing the halakhic date line The issues discussed in the previous section apply per se to individuals or communities in fixed locations. However, the act of crossing the date line (wherever it may be drawn) introduces a number of additional issues under Jewish law. Questions potentially affected include: *Crossing the line into or out of Shabbat or a holiday, or a rabbinic fast day, while already aboard an airplane or a ship *Determining what prayers to say (and when) while in transit *Lighting candles on Hanukkah *Counting of the Omer, and consequently fixing the day for Shavuot *Counting days until relations are permitted following menstruation *Fixing the date for Brit Milah, Pidyon Haben or Bar and Bat Mitzvah In some cases, crossing the date line (wherever it may be drawn) has a specific impact on practice or prohibitions under Jewish law. In others, an individual's count of days (by the experience of sunset and sunrise) is the determining factor, regardless of the crossing of the date line. Details around specific questions, cases and rulings of Jewish law are beyond the scope of this article. Considerations for astronauts Before Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon flew on the Space Shuttle Columbia in 2003, he decided (after consultation with rabbis) to observe Shabbat according to time in his last residence, Cape Canaveral, since he would be crossing the date line and observing sunset many times per day. Judith Resnik, the first American Jewish astronaut in space, lit (electronic) Shabbat candles according to the time in Houston, TX, her home and the location of Mission Control.

Biography Nikolai Albertini was born in Oster, Chernigov region, into the family of a minor state official. His father, a son of the composer and conductor Vicenzo Albertini, was of Italian and Polish descent, his mother ( Korkunova) was Russian. A Moscow 3rd Gymnasium graduate (1846), Albertini enrolled into the Moscow University to study law, and after the graduation in 1851 went on to teach jurisprudence at the 2nd Moscow Cadet Corps, which he did until 1859. In 1857 Albertini started writing for Otechestvennye Zapiski where his monthly Political Reviews made him both popular and controversial author. A staunch Anglophile who considered Great Britain a perfect model for Russia's political and economic development, Albertini was harshly criticised by radicals like Nikolai Chernyshevsky and Dmitry Pisarev, whom he habitually defended in his polemics with the conservative press. He had clashes, though, with Nikolai Dobrolyubov, on the latter's series of articles \\"From Turin\\", as well as with Grigory Blagosvetlov, on the latter's English reports. A moderate liberal, Albertini was deeply interested in the revolutionary movement and maintained strong links with Russian radicals abroad. In 1862 in London he had talks with Alexander Hertzen and regularly corresponded with Nikolai Ogaryov, who insisted that he'd 'make peace' with his Russian critics (as well as Mikhail Bakunin) 'in the name of our common cause'. In 1866 Albertini was arrested among the group of authors involved in the (Hertzen-related) so-called 'Heidelberg Reading-room Case'Literaturnoye Nasledstvo, Vols. 41-42, pp. 4-8; Vol. 63, p. 107-125 and was deported, without trial, to the Archangelsk region. In 1872 he was allowed to move to Revel and worked there for a while for the local governor's chancellery. After the return to Saint Petersburg he joined the Foreign Ministry office and became a regular contributor to Golos newspaper where his front page reviews under the Daily Topics headline appeared on a daily basis for three years. After Golos was shut down in 1883 Albertini worked for Novoye Vremya. He died in 1890 and is interred in Voskresensky Novodevichy monastery in Saint Petersburg.

Helped by like minded school friends and by her elder brother, Eberhard, she made contact with the Young Communists in Neuk√∂lln, and during 1932 was participating in anti-Nazi activities. She was at this stage particularly energised by the adverse social consequences of the Great Depression. =R√©gime change= The Nazis took power in January 1933 and lost little time in converting the German state into a one-party dictatorship. Party political activity (unless in support of the Nazi party) became illegal. By this time she had already been arrested and briefly detained by the police in connection with political leafleting: she now became more secretive about her political activities. During 1933, and on till March 1935, she attended a commercially focused school (Handelsschule) in Neuk√∂lln. During this time she was also in touch with anti-fascist groups, providing welfare support to persecuted Jewish citizens and other families of imprisoned opponents to the Nazi regime. She took several foreign holidays, covering Czechoslovakia, France, Austria and Italy, and used these as opportunities to smuggle \\"anti- fascist reading matter\\" into Germany on the way home. =Activism= In 1935, shortly before she was due to complete her studies, Goetze dropped out of school, and for several years took a succession of typing and secretarial jobs. As she moved out of her teens her political activity became more focused. She collected money to support victims of political persecution. In 1937 she visited the World Fair in Paris, the city which by this time had become the de facto headquarters of the German Communist Party in exile. She was also becoming part of a network of like minded government opponents in Berlin. In 1938 Goetze resumed the formal education that she had abandoned in 1935, attending evening classes at the \\"Heilsche Abendgymnasium\\" a private college in Sch√∂neberg, in order to prepare for the \\"Abitur\\" (school finals). Her longer term goal was to become a school teacher which would, she felt, provide a practical basis for opposition to the Nazi r√©gime. At the college she formed a particularly close friendship with the fellow activist Eva Rittmeister (born Eva Knieper). Other members of their circle included Eva's husband John, and . As more and more victims of race based and political persecution fled into exile, Goetze found that she also had an increasing range of international contacts. During the late summer of 1939, a few weeks before war resumed, she was visiting Jewish friends in London and made contact with members of the British Labour Party. By this time there was a widespread acceptance that war was coming, even if the precise timetable of its outbreak remained unclear. Goetze nevertheless resisted imprecations to stay in England, returning to Germany in order to pursue her work against the Hitler government. =War and resistance= The German Invasion of Poland at the start of September 1939 triggered the declaration of World War II, which ushered in fresh challenges for government opponents in Berlin. Goetze eventually passed her Abitur (school finals) which opened the way for her to embark on a course at Berlin University, where she enrolled on 9 April 1940 to study Philology (English and French) at the Foreign Studies / Auslandswissenschaftliche faculty (as it was then known). It was at about this time that her parents took over the management of the \\"Th√ºringer Hof\\" (hotel), moving out of the four room apartment which they had till this point shared with their children. Ursula stayed on in the former family home at Hornstra√üe 3 (3 Horn Street) in Berlin-Kreuzberg, which was becoming a meeting point where friends gathered together to listen illicitly to \\"enemy radio propaganda programmes\\": these became important as sources of information. Her fluency in French also meant she was able to translate anti-fascist leaflets into that language. Unsurprisingly in view of her activities and networks, Goetze soon came into contact with the resistance activists Harro Schulze-Boysen and Arvid Harnack, and their circle. Her apartment was used for a number of secret meetings. In the language of the Gestapo her involvement with the Schulze- Boysen/Harnack group would have made Goetze a member of the so-called Red Orchestra (Rote Kapelle). A particular friend was Werner Krauss, an academic who had been obliged to relocate from Marburg to Berlin. The two of them shared a flair for foreign languages and tried, apparently without much success, to set up resistance groups among the French forced labourers in Berlin. Permanent exhibition: The Nazi Paradise - war, hunger, lies, Gestapo - how much longer? In defiance of the urgings their more cautious fellow activists, Fritz Thiele and Harro Schulze-Boysen, on 17 May 1942 Goetze and Krauss, undertook a \\"sticker campaign\\" targeting a high-profile exhibition being held in the Lustgarten park in May/June 1942 which carried the ironic title \\"The Soviet Paradise\\". Echoing the exhibition's title, their stickers carried the message: \\"Permanent exhibition ‚Äì The Nazi Paradise ‚Äì War, Hunger, Lies, Gestapo - How much longer?\\"Gert Rosiejka: Die Rote Kapelle. ‚ÄûLandesverrat‚Äú als antifaschistischer Widerstand. ‚Äì Mit einer Einf√ºhrung von Heinrich Scheel. ergebnisse, Hamburg 1986, ; p. 68 It is not clear how much the Gestapo had been aware of Goetze's resistance activities up to this point, but if it had not happened before, by the end of August 1942 she and Krauss had been identified as members of the \\"Red Orchestra\\". Goetze was arrested in K√ºstrin on 15 October 1942. Krauss was probably arrested only in November 1942. They both faced the court on 18 January 1943 and were sentenced to death. In prison during the final months of her life, Goetze developed strong feelings of guilt, believing she had said more than was necessary and thereby unnecessarily incriminating Werner Krauss, who had had strong doubts about the sticker campaign. In order to save her friend she tried to take full responsibility onto her own shoulders, which meant disputing statements extracted from (who had already been executed). Thiel, under torture, had strongly implicated both Goetze and Krauss. (In the end the death sentence handed out to Krauss was replaced, on 14 September 1944, by a five-year prison sentence.) Ursula Goetze was one of sixteen people executed during a 45 minutes period at the Pl√∂tzensee prison during the early evening of 5 August 1943.

It is also known as Candlesticks of Christianity (≈öwieczniki chrze≈õcija≈Ñstwa). It depicts a group of early Christian martyrs who are about to be burned alive as the alleged perpetrators of the Great Fire of Rome, during the reign of emperor Nero in 64 AD. People from many different social spheres, including the emperor himself, are present to watch the burning, which takes place in front of the Domus Aurea. The motif is based on the descriptions by Suetonius and Tacitus. Reception The painting was first exhibited in 1876 at the Accademia di San Luca in Rome. It went on to tour Europe with stops in Vienna, Munich, Prague, Lviv, Berlin, Saint Petersburg, Pozna≈Ñ, Paris and London. It was met with critical acclaim by masters of academic art such as Hans Makart and Lawrence Alma-Tadema. It has been the target of criticism over Siemiradzki's handling of exterior human beauty by painter and controversial art theoretician Stanis≈Çaw Witkiewicz opposed to historical realism in general, and the monumental art of Jan Matejko in particular. Siemiradzki donated Nero's Torches to the recently initiated National Museum in Krak√≥w in 1879 during J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski‚Äôs anniversary celebrations. With his grant, Siemiradzki inaugurated the national collection. The painting is on display at the Siemiradzki Room of the Sukiennice Museum Gallery of 19th- Century Polish Art, housed at the Renaissance Sukiennice Hall in Main Square, Krak√≥w (listed as UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1978).

Born in DƒÉneasa, Olt County, his parents were Ioan Popovici, a teacher, and his wife Ioana (n√©e Popescu). After attending primary school in nearby »òerbƒÉne»ôti from 1909 to 1914, he studied at Radu Greceanu High School in Slatina from 1914 to 1923. Popovici then went to the literature faculty of Bucharest University from 1923 to 1927, earning a doctorate there in 1935. From 1924 to 1926, he was honorific teaching assistant to Dumitru Caracostea. He taught high school in Slatina (1927-1930) and Ia»ôi (1930-1936). From 1936 until his death, he was a professor in the literature faculty of Cluj University. From 1930 to 1934, he audited the Modern Greek courses of Andr√© Mirambel in Paris. He also took classes with Daniel Mornet, Fernand Baldensperger, Paul Hazard and Mario Roques, shifting toward studies of comparative literature and working as a lecturer on the Romanian language at the Sorbonne and the √âcole nationale des langues orientales vivantes. Popovici published his first articles of literary history in the Slatina magazine Oltul in 1928. His proper debut as a critic took place in 1929 in Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, with the study Poezia lui Cezar Bolliac. He took part in founding (1935) and leading (1935-1936) Atheneum magazine in Ia»ôi.

During World War II, he lived in Sibiu, having withdrawn there after the Second Vienna Award granted Northern Transylvania, including Cluj, to Hungary. While there in 1942, he founded Studii literare magazine, which ran until 1948. He also held courses on the history of literary ideology and of modern Romanian literature, published a volume of studies (CercetƒÉri de literaturƒÉ rom√¢nƒÉ) and put together critical editions of the works of Dimitrie Bolintineanu (Scrieri alese, 1942) and Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu (Opere, vol.

In its most complete form it included a large cairn covering three stone tombs, set on a small knoll. It was excavated between 1977 and 1979, revealing several phases of occupation with three separate burial chambers built in succession. It is a scheduled ancient monument, maintained by Cadw. Trefignath is adjacent to an alignment of small standing stones which extends some 350 metres northwestwards. Beyond these, some 450 metres from Trefignath, is the larger T≈∑ Mawr Standing Stone. Geology Ecological development The site is on a small rocky knoll. It is close to a marshy area, Trefignath peat bog (mostly filled in when the railroad to Holyhead was built). Pollen preserved in the peat records the changes of vegetation since the Ice Age; the sequence begins with sub-arctic post-glacial shrubs with grasses and other herbs, through the early development of forest dominated by birch and grasses, to climax forest with oak, elm, ivy, and hazel. At this stage deciduous forest covered almost all of the land area, and this would have developed a deep, rich, and well-drained soil. Initial forest clearance is recorded by increasing carbon fragments, and the later landscape clearance by grasses and grassland weeds. Some heather pollen indicates that heath had formed on depauperized and acidified soils.Chapter 4, Pollen and Plant Macrofossils. J.R.A.Greig.

Flint and chert tools, and hearths, were found on the natural ground surface under the cairn. Charcoal in this context was carbon-dated at 3100 BCE, plus or minus 70 years. Pottery sherds left before the building of the tomb were un-decorated Irish Sea ware of the early and middle Neolithic. Local clays and rocks probably provided the material for most of the pottery, but one small inclusion of perthitic biotite granite in a potsherd cannot be sourced locally and this pot may have traveled from Ireland, Scotland, or Cornwall.Page 71.

ISSN 0266-593X Trefignath from the north- west; first tomb on right, second in middle, third on left First chamber Trefignath, large adult in first tomb, fetal position The first tomb to be built was at the western end of the present mound. It had a simple, square chamber, with an entrance facing north-west, and was covered by a circular mound of stones (a cairn). It is thought that this may be the remains of a passage grave. Pollen evidence showed that it was built on an area of grassland, though there was woodland not far away and also nearby arable. There are few remaining finds, but the pottery ‚Äì heavily decorated Peterborough ware pottery of late Neolithic date ‚Äì suggests that the chamber continued in use for an extended period. Second chamber Trefignath burial chambers, small adult on site of middle, second chamber The second to be constructed was rectangular in shape and had two stones marking the entrance from a narrow forecourt. Over this, and over the earlier chamber, a long, wedge-shaped mound was constructed, which formed a long cairn. The resulting mound was edged with drystone walling. Third chamber Trefignath, small adult in third, eastward tomb The third chamber, at the eastern end, was added to the front of the central chamber. It was also constructed with large entrance stones and in the same style, but there was no longer any means of access to the central chamber. The long cairn was then extended to cover this chamber as well. Late Neolithic pottery was found at the entrance.

No version of it appears in the 1352 extent of Anglesey, and the name was first recorded (as Trefignerth) in 1624. In early records the name referred to a small farm rather than the monument. The initial element is the common word \\"tref\\", meaning a homestead or hamlet. The remainder may be an unrecorded personal name containing the element \\"nerth\\", or it may be composed of \\"mign\\", meaning swamp or quagmire, and an unknown suffix \\"eth\\".Page 3.

Projects  Stacked Datsun (2013) is a project that draws on themes from the American West (the 1960s Datsun pickup bed), international shipping industry (wooden pallets), and handicraft traditions (mother of pearl inlay). In combining these references through appropriated objects and ornate patterns meticulously inlayed into the pallets, Roth disrupts the traditional function of the materials and calls into question the value of labor, the romantic quest for progress, and the disassociation between commercial goods and their place of origin. 10,000dwt (pennyweights) (2011) is a chainlink fence that the artist made by hand with sterling silver. The work mimics the commonplace galvanized chainlink fences that are mass- produced and used as a barrier on both private and public property. Roth recontextualizes the uninviting form by producing her version with a precious metal, typically used in jewelry and flatware production. Prodded, Tugged, Pushed, Pulled and Paleta::Pallet (2007) are two of Roth's projects that she developed through research and residencies in the Philippines. Appropriating forms commonly used to ship goods or mobilize commercial products, Roth recontextualizes shipping pallets and furniture dollies by incorporating traditional Filipino handicraft into their construction. Prodded, Tugged, Pushed, Pulled is a series of objects made of mahogany and rattan that imitate the everyday furniture dolly. Paleta::Pallet is a series of wooden pallets that have been intricately handcarved with a traditional Filipino motif. These projects draw attention to the universal devices that transport goods around the world without retaining a sense of origin. Detoured (2003‚Äì2005) is a series of sculptures that explore themes of authority and glamour and how transposing these associations through object and material can bring up questions regarding boundaries and regulations, and whose job it is to enforce them. Roth has covered the surface of police barriers in small mirrors resembling a disco ball, she created traffic cones using pinata construction techniques and filled the insides with candy, and produced satin slipcovers for concrete road barricades.

He wrote during the time when the House of Hohenzollern, the dynasty of the later kings of Prussia, gained rulership over Brandenburg. Born in Brandenburg to a family originally from Wusterwitz, Engelbert studied at the University of Erfurt in 1404 and at the University of Prague in 1406/7. He worked as a clerk and jurist in Brandenburg and Magdeburg. In Magdeburg, the Sch√∂ppenchronik is continued in his hand for the period of 1411 to 1421. In 1427, he was in the service of the bishop of Halberstadt. His own chronicle covered the period of 1391 to 1423. During this time, Frederick VI, Burgrave of Nuremberg of the House of Hohenzollern, was appointed governor of Brandenburg in order to restore order and stability amid excessive feuds between the nobility and later elevated to the rank of Elector and Margrave of Brandenburg as Frederick I. Engelbert supported Frederick and was critical of the feudal quarrels of the local nobility. The text survives only in excerpts quoted by the 16th-century chroniclers Andreas Angelus and Peter Hafftiz. A reconstruction of the text was presented by Ribbe (1973). Earlier printed editions are found in Riedel, Codex diplomaticus Brandenburgensis IV.1 (1862), Heidemann (1878) and Tschirch (1912).

During the fires, the Shire of Esperance experienced two significant fires and a complex of fires; were burnt by the Cascades fire, were burnt by the Merivale fire, and were burnt by the Cape Arid complex of fires. On 17 November, during the major run of the Cascades fire, four civilian fatalities occurred in vehicles traveling on Griggs Road in Scaddan. , the Cascades fire was equally the worst bushfire in Western Australia in terms of human fatalities along with the Willow Springs/Nannup fire of January 1958. The Cascades fire destroyed Scaddan town hall, one house, 16 non-residential structures and dozens of vehicles in the communities of Grass Patch, Salmon Gums and Scaddan. There was also significant damage to rural produce; approximately 4,500 head of livestock died and of crop‚Äîconstituting about 500,000 tonnes of grain‚Äîwere burnt. In addition, the Merivale fire destroyed 2 houses in Stockyard Creek, and the Cape Arid complex destroyed significant areas of Western Ground Parrot habitat‚Äîreportedly up to 90%‚Äîprompting discussion that the critically endangered parrot could \\"... become the first bird in at least 200 years to become extinct in Western Australia\\".  Background  Agriculture is the predominant land use by area in the Shire of Esperance; between 1990 and 2000 the region witnessed an increase of 50% in the total cropped area and a decrease in the total area dedicated to livestock farming, the main crops produced are wheat, barley and canola. Cropped areas are particularly combustible prior to harvest, and stubble is retained post harvest to reduce soil erosion, which maintains a combustible ground cover and increases fuel load in pre‚Äêharvest fields. The Esperance region had above average winter rainfall in 2015, promoting the growth of large quantities of crops and other plant material. Salmon Gums Research Station, north of Esperance town, reported its highest winter rainfall in 88 years; fell in August, the highest August total rainfall for at least 30 years. Prior to the 2015 harvest, yields of up to 5 tonnes per hectare were reported in the Esperance district, which was estimated to be around 50% harvested at the time of the fires. This represented a 2015 harvest that was far above the 5 year average, even accounting for the \\"... hundreds of thousands of tonnes\\" of grain lost during the fire. The winter rains were followed by an unusually dry and warm spring, which rapidly dried out the unharvested crops and other plant material. Statewide average temperatures in Western Australia during October were +3.28 ¬∞C above average and the highest on record, and rainfall was generally light across the Esperance region at Temperature observations were similarly elevated in November, at +1.78 ¬∞C above average and the second warmest on record. = Predictions for the 2015‚Äì16 bushfire season = A strengthening El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation event across the Pacific Ocean and the warmer waters associated with the Indian Ocean Dipole, was expected to increase the severity and duration of the 2015‚Äì16 fire season in Western Australia, with the Goldfields-Esperance region in particular to experience \\"above normal fire potential\\" due to high fuel loads.  Fire timeline  = 14‚Äì16 November = Over the weekend of 14‚Äì15 November, a trough system consisting of numerous thunderstorms moved in an easterly direction over southern Western Australia and lightning ignited fires across a large area. At least 40 fires were recorded by the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) on 15 November, including the Cascades fire, the Merivale fire, and the Cape Arid complex, which constituted three of the ten incidents recorded by the DFES in the Shire of Esperance. The Cascades fire ignited north of Pyramid Rd. and west of Ned's Corner Rd. on unallocated crown land south of Lake Mends in the North Cascades area. Lightning from the same storm system also ignited the Merivale fire in the vicinity of Doombup Lake and Mullet Lake, east of Esperance town, and the Cape Arid complex of fires in the Gypsum Mine, Mount Ragged, and Thomas River areas of the northern part of Cape Arid National Park. The fires remained uncontained by dawn on 16 November and a bushfire advice message for North Cascade was issued by the DFES at 11:30 AWST (UTC+08:00), although there was no threat to lives or homes at the time. Winds in the Cascades fire ground on 16 November were light to fresh breezes to from the south-south-east and relative humidity ranged from approximately 25‚Äì55%; conditions favorable to containment. However, by the end of the day on 16 November, both the Cascades and Merivale fire remained uncontained and residents of 7 properties near the Merivale fire were advised to leave. At a briefing by the Bureau of Meteorology to the DFES on 16 November, a McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) rating of 250‚Äì260 was reportedly forecast for 17 November; described as \\"... worse than the day of the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria that claimed 173 lives and injured some 5000 people\\". Despite fears for the escalation of the fire in the forecast conditions, which greatly exceeded the threshold for \\"catastrophic\\" (an FFDI of 100), all three fires remained at the classification of \\"Level 1\\" and therefore under the control of local brigades. Following the fires, Deputy Commissioner of the DFES, Lloyd Bailey, stated that on 16 November; > = 17 November = The passage of a low pressure system over the south-west > of the state created winds of moderate gale to storm force from the north to > west over the Shire of Esperance and all three fire zones, elevating the > temperature to over across most of the shire. An extremely low relative > humidity of 6% was observed at the Salmon Gums Research Station at 15:00 > AWST, and a \\"storm force\\" wind gust of from the west-north-west was recorded > at 15:37 AWST. Winds were consistently during the afternoon, with frequent > gusts up to .

FFDI ratings of up to 221 were reportedly observed > elsewhere around Esperance. This resulted in an escalation of all three > fires, including the major run of the Cascades fire. As early as 06:30 AWST, > farmers made calls to fire authorities with concerns about the height of > flames in inaccessible areas close to properties in and around Cascades, as > the fire front expanded to at least . During the morning, the Cascades and > Merivale fires caused power outages in Esperance shire that affected at > least 300 customers and also stopped mobile phone coverage.

All four civilians fatalities from the Cascades fire occurred at > approximately 15:50 AWST, when the fire front impacted Griggs Rd. between > Cascade and Scaddan. The Cascades fire crossed the Coolgardie‚ÄìEsperance > Highway at approximately 17:50 AWST and impacted the community of Scaddan, > where the majority of structural damage occurred. The DFES superintendent > for Goldfields-Esperance, Trevor Tasker, witnessed the fire front impacting > the highway and created a road block, preventing an estimated 100 > cars‚Äîcontaining approximately 200 tourists and locals‚Äîfrom driving into the > flames; police in Norseman prevented traffic entering the area impacted by > fire from the opposite direction. Scaddan farmer Chris Reichstein used a > speed tiller to cut a firebreak several meters wide through burning crops > and stubble along the eastern edge of the fire front, preventing the fire > front from crossing into bushland where it \\"... could have burned for > weeks\\". Ninety minutes after the fire front had traversed the highway and > impacted Scaddan township, the fire was upgraded to \\"Level 3\\", a designation > that effectively grants the DFES command and control of the incident. By > mid‚Äìevening, between 100 and 150 people from Scaddan and Grass Patch had > evacuated to Salmon Gums Recreation Centre, and at approximately 22:00 AWST > the area under threat was expanded to include Red Lake and Salmon Gums.

There are 31 different families of HERVs that together make up about 8% of the human genome, this is four times more DNA than is devoted to protein coding genes. Most HERVs in the genome today are not replication-competent due to frame shifts, premature stop codons and recombination in their long terminal repeats (LTRs). Each HERV family is derived from a single infection of the germline by an exogenous retrovirus that once integrated expanded and evolved. A complete HERV contains U3RU5- gag- pro- pol- env ‚ÄìU3RU5, where U3RU5 are long terminal repeats (LTRs) and gag, pro, pol and env are genes. Phylogeny It is common for viruses to take pieces of their host's genome with them if it aids their success. On the other hand, hosts can also keep viral DNA in their genome in some advantageous or non-deleterious cases. In the case of HERVs, viral DNA integrated into the germ-line genome of a human ancestor. Thus, all the progeny of the infected human ancestor would have this viral genome integrated into every cell in their bodies. This new retroviral DNA can now be passed on vertically from parents to child. Furthermore, the integrated viral genome has transposable element features, meaning it can replicate and/or jump in the human ancestor genome. Looking to the genomes of many species related to humans helped determine how long ago this retroviral genome was integrated into the human ancestor. Performing southern blots with primate blood samples and gag, pol and pro probes (from 100MSRV) suggested HERV-W entered the genome of catarrhines over 23 million years ago. Later, blood samples from various primates: hominoids, Old World monkeys, New World monkeys and prosimians were probed using a fluorescently labeled HERV-W element derived from the gorilla fosmid library. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed HERV-W elements in all the primate blood samples except the tupaia. With this information and the divergence values of the 5‚Äô and 3‚Äô LTRs the construction of a phylogenetic tree was possible. This data implies that the HERV-W genome integrated into its host's germ-line around 63 million years ago, expanded in the era of Old and New World monkeys and then evolved independently. Since its integration the 5‚Äô and 3‚Äô LTR have followed independent evolution in each species. HERV-W is named for the fact that many in the group uses a tryptophan tRNA in the primer binding site (PBS). The classification has been expanded into a HERVW9 (HERV9, HERVW, HERV30, MER41, HERV35, LTR19) group under the gammaretrovirus-like class I, after a more robust phylogenetic study. A proposed nomenclature suggests putting all such \\"class I\\" elements in a genus- level taxon separate from Gammaretrovirus. Discovery HERV-W was discovered because of its connection to multiple sclerosis (MS). In macrophage cell cultures of patients with MS several retroviral-like particles with reverse transcriptase (RT) activity were detected and given the name multiple sclerosis retroviruses (MSRVs). Because of MSRV's retroviral nature it was originally thought that MSRV had an exogenous viral origin. However, MSRV's phylogenetic and experimental similarities to human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) quickly revealed themselves. Thus, many labs began searching for the specific HERV family of which MSRV belonged. Using the consensus sequence for retroviral pol and ‚Äúpanretro‚Äù RT-PCR extensions from the pol region of MSRV (retroviral RNA) the discovery of a HERV with gag, pol and env was made possible. The primer binding site (PBS) of this HERV discovered is similar to avian retroviral PBSs, which uses tRNATRP, this HERV was thus named HERV-W. In hopes of finding the open reading frames (ORFs) of this HERV, healthy tissues were probed with reverse transcribed Ppol-, gag- and env-MSRV sequences (cDNAs). Overlapping cDNAs spanned a 7.6 kb complete HERV with RU5- gag- pol- env- U3R sequences; a polypurine tract; and a primer-binding site (PBS). The pol and gag ORFs are not replication competent due to frame shifts and stop codons but the env ORF is complete. Performing multiple-tissue Northern Blots on a variety of human tissues lead to the discovery of 8-, 3.1- and 1.3-kb transcripts in placental tissue not expressed in heart, brain, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney or pancreas cells. This was confirmed by Ppol-MSRV, gag and env probes. Performing a BLASTn query search with the ESTs (expressed sequence tags) database for the cDNA clones derived from the probes, revealed that 53% of related transcripts were found in placental cells. A southern blot using hybridization of gag, pro, env derived probes revealed a complex distribution of HERV-Ws in the human haploid genome with 70 gag, 100 pro, and 30 env regions. With in vitro transcription techniques three suggested ORFs on chromosome 3 (gag), 6 (pro) and 7 (env) were detected and further analyzed revealing that the ORF on chromosome 7q21.2 uniquely encoded a glycosylated Env protein. Performing RealTime RT-PCR on adrenal gland, bone marrow, cerebellum, whole brain, fetal brain, fetal liver, heart, kidney, liver, lung, placenta, prostate, salivary gland, skeletal muscle, spinal cord, testis, thymus, thyroid gland, trachea, and uterus cells revealed 22 complete HERV-W families on chromosomes 1‚Äì3, 5‚Äì8, 10‚Äì12, 15, 19 and X. In silico expression data revealed that these HERV-W elements are randomly expressed in various tissues (brain, mammary gland, cerebrum, skin, testis, eye, embroyonic tissue, pancreatic islet, pineal gland, endocrine, retina, adipose tissue, placenta and muscle). Further, human tissues that lack some sort of HERV expression could not be found which suggests that HERVs are permanent members of the human transcriptome. Although expression of HERV-W is prevalent in the whole body there are two tissues whose expression levels are higher than the rest. The HERV-W derived element of chromosome 12p11.21 and 7q21.2 had 42 hits from the env gene in pancreatic islet tissues and 224 hits (11 gag, 41 pol, 164 env) in placenta, testis, and embryotic tissues, respectively. The HERV-W element on 7q21.2 encodes for ERVWE-1, which was named synctin-1. Biological function Upon realizing that HERV-W was prevalent in the human genome and can form viable transcripts, scientists began searching for HERV-W's biological significance. The HERV-W Env gene expressed in a vector was transfected into TELCeB6 cells, and TELac2 cells, to test for virus-cell and cell-cell fusion respectively. One to two days after transfection numerous multinucleated giant cells, or syncytia, formed indicating the HERV-W env gene can cause homotypic and heterotypic cell-cell fusion. As a control a gene known to be hyperfusogenic, A-Rless, was transfected into the cell-line . Upon transfection of cells with this vector there was only a 6% fusion of cells as opposed to a 48% fusion with the HERV-W vector, thus revealing the gene encoded by HERV-W env is a highly fusogenic membrane glycoprotein. Retroviruses that infect human cells interact with different receptors, thus investigation began to find with which receptor HERV-W interacts. The HERV-W envelope glycoprotein could fuse parental TE671 cells (human embryo cells, identical to human rhadbomyosarcoma RD cells), PiT-1 and PiT-2-blocked cells (PiT1/2 are retroviral (RV) receptors), but not retroviral type D receptor- blocked cells. It was concluded that HERV-W may recognize and interact with the type D mammalian retroviral receptors expressed in humans. With the knowledge of HERV-W's highly fusogenic properties and its heightened expression in placental cell a putative role for HERV-W in placental formation was suggested. The cytotrophoblast cells proliferate and invade maternal endometrium, which is key to implantation and placental development. Furthermore, cytotrophoblasts fuse and differentiate into multinucleated synctiotrophoblast cells that are surrounded by maternal blood and cover the embryo. Synctiotrophoblast help with nutrient circulation, ion exchange and hormone synthesis, which are all key to development. These multinucleated cells appear very similar to virally induced syncytia. HERV-W's main gene expression is ERVWE-1 which is a highly fusogenic env glycoprotein also called syncytin-1 because it induces the formation of syncytia (multinucleated cells). Scientists began searching for ways that syncytin was involved in placental cytotrophoblast fusion and differentiation. Using monoclonal fluorescently labeled antibodies the Frendo Lab was able to visualize the Env-W expression at the apical membrane of the synctiotrophoblast in first- trimester placentas. They were then able to show syncytin affected both the fusion of the trophoblast to the uterus and the differentiation of the trophoblast. To do this they stained cells with anti-desmoplakin antibodies to reveal cell boundaries. As the cells differentiate into syncytiotrophoblasts the ability to see desmoplakin decreases, meaning that cells are fusing together. Furthermore, as the cytotrophoblast differentiates the expression of HERV-W env mRNA and glycoprotein both increase collinearly suggesting HERV-W env expression is correlated with the fusion and differentiation of cells. This data suggests the factor that regulates trophoblast differentiation also regulates HERV-W env mRNA and protein expression and that a retroviral infection long ago may have been a pivotal event in mammalian evolution. Furthermore, HERV-W env glycoprotein has been shown to contain an immunosuppressive region. This immunosuppressive nature of synctin-1 and/or synctin-2 (HERV-K) may be key in creating an immunologic barrier between the mother and the fetus. Since the fetus only share half of the mother's DNA it is critical that the mother's immune system does not reject or attack the fetus. Analyzing 40 full-term placental tissues with immunohistochemical staining and RT in situ PCR, shows strong expression of synctin-1 in synctiotrophoblasts compared to cytotrophoblasts. This suggests a symbiotic relationship between HERV expression and the host. In contrast to this data, placental micro-vesicles, which also have high expression of synctin-1 have been shown through peripheral blood mononuclear cell assays to activate the immune system thought the production of cytokines and chemokines. This suggests placental micro-vesicles can modulate the mother's immune system. Today, it is still difficult to tell the exact mechanism that ERVWE-1 uses to suppress and/or activate the mother's immune system. Mechanism of Expression and Environmental Factors The mechanism of expression for HERV-W genes is still not completely understood. The 780 bp LTR's that flank the env, pro, pol and gag, genes provide a range of regulatory sequences such as promoters, enhancers, and transcription factor binding sites. The 5‚Äô U3 region acts as a promoter and the 3‚Äô R acts as a poly A signal. It would be reasonable to assume that HERV-W genes could not be transcribed from HERV-W elements that have incomplete LTRs. However, using a luciferase reporter gene assay HERV-Ws that have incomplete LTR's were still found to have promoter activity. This suggests that the transcription of HERV's can be activated not just by LTR- directed transcription but also by transcriptional leakage. Meaning if a nearby gene is being transcribed the transcription factors and polymerase can just keep moving along the DNA reaching the nearby HERV, where they can then transcribe it. In fact by doing a Chip-seq analysis of HERV-W LTR's it was found that ¬º of HERV-W LTR's can be bound by transcription factor p56 (ENCODE Project). This indicates a reason behind HERV-W's cell specific expression. Different cell types transcribe varying genes, if a highly transcribed gene for placental cells, for example, happens to fall adjacent to a HERV-W element transcriptional leakage could explain HERV-W's heightened expression in this case. This mechanism of transcription is still being studied. Since there is a correlation between high cytokine production and MS, a study was done to test the regulation of a synctin-1 promoter by MS related cytokines such as TNFa, IFN-y, and IL-6. This experiment was performed with human astrocytic cells and showed that TNFa has the ability to activate the ERVWE-1 promoter through a NF-Œ∫B element. Final putative mechanisms of control of ERVWE-1 are by CpG promoter methylation and histone modification. Overexpression of ERVWE-1, which produces snyctin-1, would be dangerous in many adult cells. Thus, the promoter is methylated and histone modification occurs in non-placental cells to keep the expression of HERV-W low. In placenta cells, ERVWE-1 must be de- methylated to become active. It is also thought that environmental factors can influence the expression of HERV-W. Through qPCR methods and infection of cells with influenza and human herpes simplex 1 it was found that HERV-W has a heighted expression in a cell-specific manner when infected but no mechanism was revealed. Also, when these cells are placed in stressful environments such as serum deprivation similar and increased expression of HERV-W is also recorded. This suggests that HERV-W is modulated by environmental effects. Another study also infected cells with influenza to show that this virus can transactivate HERV-W elements. Influenza produces Glial Cells missing 1 (GCM1) that can act as an enhancer to reduce the repression of histone modification on HERV-Ws. This can lead to an increase in the transcription of HERV-W elements. HERV-W‚Äôs role in multiple sclerosis Since the detection of MSRV Env protein in the plasma of multiple sclerosis patients and the realization that is a member of the HERV-W family, the questions of how HERV-W was related to Multiple sclerosis and what caused transcription of HERV-W were investigated. Both the expression of MSRV in vitro with peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC; which are critical to the immune system) cultures and in vivo in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse models, illustrated a pro-inflammatory response. Inflammation can occur when the immune system recognizes an antigen and activates the immune response cascade. The transcribed and translated products of the HERV-W Env gene come from retroviral DNA thus the human body detects these proteins as antigens triggering the immune response. Specifically, cytokine production is elevated in the MS PBMC cultures as compared to the healthy controls and mediated by the surface unit of the MSRV Env protein. This suggests that the MSRV Env protein may induce abnormal cytokine secretion, which leads to inflammation. A further explanation of how the expression of MSRV causes inflammation is found when looking at overexpression of synctin-1 in glia cells (cells that surround the neurons). The result is endoplasmic reticulum stress that leads to neuro- inflammation and the production of free radicals, which leads to further damage of nearby cells. Finally, it was discovered through TLR-4 signaling assays, cytokine ELISAs, OPC cell cultures and statistical analysis that MSRV- Env is a highly potent TLR-4 activator. MSRV-Env in vitro and in vivo induces TLR4 dependent pro-inflammatory stimulus and weakens the precursor cells of oligodendrocytes (produce myelin in CNS). This suggests a positive feedback loop where cytokines promote HERV-W transcription and then the transcription of HERV-W leads to a higher cytokine production. Comparing Gag and Env expression in control patients and patients with MS it was found that Gag and Env are expressed at physiological levels in cells of the CNS under normal conditions. However, in patients with MS lesions there is a large accumulation of Gag proteins in demyelinated white matter. This data suggests HERV-W env and gag genes in MS patients either have a distinct regulation of their inherited HERV-W copies or that HERV-W is infectious in MS patients. By examining the regulation of a synctin-1 promoter the Mameli Lab was able to better understand the mechanism for ERVWE1 regulation in nerve tissue. They found through a CHIP assay that TNFa (a cytokine) causes the p65 transcription factor to bind to the promoter. This was confirmed by deleting the cellular enhancer, where p65 binds, which resulted in less transcription A contrasting study performed a micro-array to analyze HERV transcription in human brains. Using 215 brain samples derived from SZ, BD and control patients it was found that the expression of HERV ‚Äì E/F/K were weakly correlated with SZ and BD and that ERVWE-1 expression remained unaffected in SZ and BD compared to controls. It is still not known today if MSRV plays a causal or reactive role in MS. Another step in understanding the genomic origin of the HERV-W member transcribed in MS patients was made when looking to the HERV-W element of the Xq22.3. Since women are twice as likely to have MS compared to men and the Xq22.3 has almost a complete ORF thus a possible connection between Xq22.3 and MS was proposed. HERV-W and schizophrenia To date not much hard evidence has been found to support a strong correlation between HERV-W transcripts and schizophrenia (SZ). One study found 10 out of 35 individuals with recent onset schizophrenia had retroviral pol gene HERV-W transcripts and murine leukemia virus gene transcripts in cell-free CSF and 1 in 20 patients with chronic schizophrenia. This was significant when compared to the 22 non-inflammatory patients and the 30 healthy patients that had no retroviral transcripts. Contrasting this data a micro-array was performed to analyze HERV transcription activity in human brains. They found a weak correlation between HERV's ‚ÄìK, -E, -F and that env-W expression was constant in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BD) compared to controls. Today, it is still hard to tell if HERVs play a causal role, are correlated with or are just a response to in neuropsychiatric diseases. Drug Production As knowledge about the mechanism of production for HERV-W transcripts is growing, scientists are beginning to synthesize drugs that can interrupt the MSRV pathway. A humanized monoclonal antibody called GNbAc1 of the IgG4 class binds with high specificity and affinity to the extracellular domain of the MSRV-Env protein. When performing experiments another humanized IgG4 class antibody was used as a control. It was found through many experiments that GNbAc1 is able to antagonize all the MSRV-Env effects. This drug is still in its early stages of development. On Jan. 2019 the drug GNbAC1 was granted the name Temelimab by the World Health Organization (WHO)GeNeuro Announces Positive Results from Temelimab (GNbAC1) Phase 1 High-dose Clinical Trial, International Nonproprietary Name ‚Äútemelimab‚Äù Assigned to GNbAC1, Press Release, References Category:Endogenous retroviruses Category:Retroviridae ","title":"Human Endogenous Retrovirus-W"},{"id":"50428253","text":"Hugo Preu√ü Bridge (German: Hugo-Preu√ü-Br√ºcke) is a bridge connecting Berlin- Mitte and Moabit in Berlin, Germany.

However, cremation in Ireland dates as far back as the Stone Age.  History  The earliest cremations in Ireland were carried out by the Stone Age people between 7000-2000 BC. Cremated remains were placed in stone structures such as passage tombs as well as small stone basins, which are thought to have served as resting places for the deceased. In pagan Ireland, ashes and bone fragments were deposited in an ornamented urn, generally made of baked clay, but sometimes of stone instead. Cremation was extensively practiced in pagan Ireland. Urns containing ashes and burnt bones have been found in graves in every part of the country. The introduction of Christianity to Ireland in 432 AD caused burial to become the norm as Christian rites sanctioned and continued burial while replacing the old pagan ways. Cremation and burial were practiced simultaneously, complete skeletons have been found along with urns containing ashes and burnt bones in the same grave. Cremation was a troublesome and expensive process, and could not have been practiced by underprivileged people, who most likely buried the body as it was. Newgrange in County Meath is the most famous example of a passage tomb in Ireland. It is thought that the remains might have been placed in stone basins in Newgrange as a sort of religious ceremony. Some historians assume that when the sun shines into Newgrange on the Winter Solstice, it represents the souls of the departed being transported into the next life by the sunlight. When the Cremation Act was passed in the United Kingdom in 1902, it did not extend to Ireland, which was still part of the United Kingdom at the time. Facilities Glasnevin Cemetery The first crematorium on the island of Ireland opened in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 1961, but it took another twenty year for modern cremation to be available in the Republic of Ireland, when Glasnevin Cemetery opened their crematorium in March 1982. In 2000, Mount Jerome Cemetery established its own crematorium. The following year, Newlands Cross Cemetery, which opened the previous year, established a crematorium. The Island Crematorium Company in County Cork was established around February 2005. Cremation facilities were opened in County Cavan in mid-2015, in Dublin's Dardistown in October 2016 and in Shannon in 2017.https://www.cremation.org.uk/eire-2017  Cremation in Ireland today  Cremation is increasingly popular in Ireland as an alternative to burial, but it is still not very popular, especially compared to burial.

Rudolf, the traditional heir to the margraviate assumed the title upon the death of his predecessor Conrad von Pl√∂tzkau. A chronicle of the 15th century reported that Rudolf resided in Burg, Dithmarschen (B√∂kelnburg). He ruled with a heavy hand and demanded his grain tithe even after several years of drought. The Dithmarscher farmers used a ruse to get rid of their unpopular regent. Hidden in sacks of corn were weapons. As agreed, they opened the bags at the sound of the battle cry \\"R√∂hret de Hann, snidet de sac spell!\\" (Shall ye touch hands, cuts the bag volumes). They set the castle on fire, killed the count along with his wife, and so won their freedom. This event is still recounted today in performances at the castle. Rudolf was married to Elisabeth, daughter of Leopold I the Strong, Margrave of Styria. No children are recorded of this union. With the death of Rudolf, the male line of the Margraves of the Nordmark died out. After the death of Rudolf, his brother Hartwig transferred his inheritance to the Archbishopric of Bremen in return for a regrant of a life interest, presumably to obtain a powerful protector against the aggression of Henry the Lion. The move was ineffective, as Henry took possession of the lands and captured both Hartwig and the archbishop Adelbero, releasing them only after they agreed to recognize his claim. Rudolf‚Äôs successor as Margrave of the Nordmark was Albert the Bear. Upon Rudolf's death, his brother Hartwig succeeded him as Count of Stade.

The concept for JOEY Restaurants was created by Jeff Fuller. JOEY restaurants is a part of a chain of family- owned restaurants, expanding all throughout North America. The restaurant focuses on Asian, American, Mediterranean and other global dishes. The company operates 27 full-service restaurants in Canada and expanding in the United States. All JOEY restaurants feature a bar area and serve alcoholic beverages. History = Founding and Early Years = The first JOEY Restaurant was opened in 1992 in Calgary, Alberta. The chain now operates over twenty five restaurants. The company's founding President and CEO is Jeff Fuller, son of restaurateur Leroy \\"Bus\\" Fuller (1928-2019), who founded the Earls restaurant chain with Jeff's brother Stan Fuller. Leroy Fuller was an experienced restaurateur who built the family restaurant empire stemming from one of the original A&W; Restaurant franchises in Canada, an American chain of fast-food restaurants known for draft root beers, floats and burgers. JOEY was originally conceived as a pasta house called \\"Joey Tomato's\\", which opened in Calgary in 1992 as a casual pasta and pizza joint. As more menu items were added eight years later, the name was changed to \\"Joey Tomato's Mediterranean Grill,\\" before being shortened in 2005 to simply \\"JOEY.\\" Executive Chef, Chris Mills, began adding Asian cuisine into the menu as a way to rebrand the image. The company also owns the American restaurant Cucina, Cucina. In 2016, Al Jessa was promoted to company President, marking another link between the Earls chain and JOEY.

History  After comparison of different options in the environmental effects report, in the beginning of 2014 the Flemish Government chose the BAM track to complete the ring road, in combination with a tunnel under the Albert Canal. That tunnel was a new element. Ringland came up with more demands and insisted on a roof on the entire Ring. Ringland claims this would lead to less pollution and damage by (ultra)fine particles, and less noise disturbance, hence enhancing the liveability of the environment. In June 2015 the Ringland band - consisting of local artists Styrofoam, Marcel Vanthilt, Bart Peeters, Slongs Dievanongs, Merdan Taplak, Pieter Embrechts and Halve Neuro - created the protest song Laat de Mensen Dansen (\\"Let the People Dance\\"). The title was not emitted by the main Flemish broadcasting companies VRT and Medialaan because of the political tone. The Ringland Festival has already taken place twice, both times as a fund raiser for research on the roofing of the ring road. At the first edition on 15 June 2014 15,000 visitors appeared, and 20,000 at the second edition on 27 June 2015. The festival symbolically took place on top of the Craeybeckx Tunnel, which guides the E19 road under the Middelheim park and hospital.  Claims  The main reasons the organisation gives for realisation of the project, besides the reduction of pollution and noise, are smoother and safer road traffic and additional space including green areas.

He was considered to be one of the best- known Jesuit priests in Australia and had the nickname \\"The Mighty Atom\\".  Biography  = Early years = Albert Power was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1870. His education started at Belvedere College, Dublin, and continued at Tullabeg College, County Offaly. After Tullabeg College he studied at Milltown Park Theological College, Dublin. He was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest in 1906 in the Society of Jesus. = Career = After his ordination, Power became the director of studies at Riverview College (now called Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview) in Sydney for six years (c. 1910). Power returned to Europe to study philosophy and literature in Valkenburg, Holland. He was there for two years and then returned to Milltown Park Theological College, Dublin, to study the same subjects. He lectured in theology, Scripture and ecclesiastical history for ten years as the Professor of Sacred Scriptures at Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy. For the latter eight years he was also the rector of the college. Power returned to Australia in 1919 to become the rector of Newman College, Melbourne. The Archbishop of Melbourne, Daniel Mannix, insisted that Power, a classical scholar, was appointed to the role. In a telegram Mannix wrote \\"Power or nobody.\\" Upon taking up the role he said that his policy would be \\"to act in accordance with the great cardinal after whom it was named, and to provide a liberal Christian education\\". Power started at Newman College with a \\"big reputation for scholastic attainments\\". At the end of his first year as rector, Power wrote that expenses had not been covered and that they had nothing to pay to the Jesuits. He held the role of rector of Newman College until 1923. Power as rector of Newman College, Melbourne In 1923 he became the first rector, at the request of Mannix, of Corpus Christi College, Melbourne, when it was founded in the same year. = Retirement = After retiring in 1948 he resided at Xavier College, Kew, for a number of years. = Death = After Power's death a Solemn Pontificial Requiem Mass was celebrated by Archbishop Daniel Mannix at St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne. The choir was made up of students from Corpus Christi College.  Under surveillance  On 19 April 1918 a letter was passed between Australian security officials advising the recipient to keep \\"Power under observation\\". The letter writer commented that \\"he [Power] is an eloquent speaker, and has great influence\\" and that \\"the object of his visit [to Australia] is unknown\\". A further letter was written on 13 July 1918 in which the writer supports the rumour that the position of chaplain onboard a troop ship is an \\"excellent way of taking Sinn F√©in propagandists into the Commonwealth of Nations\\".  Father Albert Power Burse  In January 1952, \\"A Grateful Friend\\" wrote to the editor of The Advocate (Melbourne) noting that a burse was being created in memory of Power to educate a priest for the Jesuit Indian Mission.  Albert Power Debating Society  In the 1954 Newman College yearbook the Albert Power Debating Society is reported as having had large numbers participating in the society. Issues debated included \\"That Newman should have a moat\\" and \\"that the press is worth of its freedom\\". Perhaps the most engaging debate was with a team of ladies from St Mary's Hall when the subject was \\"that it was better to have loved and lost then never to have loved at all\\". The Albert Power Debating Society is known to have run between 1927 and 1967 when its activities were reported in the Newman College yearbooks. The society is known to have had problems with numbers of students participating in its activities in 1937 when the annual magazine of the Newman College Students' Club reported that the society had to close for a year. In 2010 the Albert Power SJ Medallion for Debating was awarded to Tom Litfin and Patrick McDonald.

She lives and works in Toronto.  Education  Hurlbut studied at the Ontario College of Art and Design, now known as OCAD University from 1971 to 1973 and the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design (NSCAD University) from 1973 to 1975.  Works  Early in her career, Hurlbut created on-site work using plaster that dispelled the 'common assumption that our built environment simply exists'. Beginning in her studio in 1977, Hurlbut made a number of wall works. A hand plastered wall work The Wall was made in the Art Gallery of Ontario in 1981 and the W√ºrttembergischer Kunstverein in Stuttgart in 1983. The installation Three Tree Columns was featured at the Toronto Sculpture Garden in 1986 and on the campus of York University in 1989. Its components included actual tree trunks with Doric bases and capitals made from steel. In her later work, she investigated the origins of classical Greek architecture. Ovo and Claw Entablature (1990) is an example of such work. The Final Sleep/Le Dernier Sommeil was an installation created from Artifacts in the Royal Ontario Museum in 2001 In the mid 90s Hurlbut began to photograph cremated ashes. Several of those works, Mary #3 (2006), Peewee #2 (2007) and Scarlett #1 (2005) are in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada. Airborne, a slow-motion video work from 2008 is a reflection on mortality. It documents the release of human ashes entrusted to the artist by relatives of the deceased, including her own father.

Medical sources meanwhile stated on 11 December that four LNA fighters had been killed and 10 others injured since beginning of December. Clashes erupted between the two sides on 14 December, in response to killing of two soldiers by a sniper from Ansar al- Sharia, according to army officer Saeed Wanees. He added that the army's assault aimed at \\"ending the battle in Benghazi and completing the liberation announced months ago.\\" Meanwhile, nine soldiers had been killed in the battle since the beginning of December. LNA took over the last remaining militant stronghold of Sidi Akribesh on 28 December. The military announced that it had captured this last district of Benghazi from the Islamist fighters. Commander Wanis Bukhamada, head of army special forces, said LNA now fully controlled the district. They also stated they had captured the Baladi hotel and its surroundings. Al-Jalaa Hospital received 17 dead LNA fighters and 76 wounded ones in December 2017. An LNA source stated on 29 December that three militants were killed in clashes. The source added that they were still besieging a number of terrorists in the area and the three who were killed were hiding in the rubble of the municipal hotel while the army was searching for fleeing militants. A military source stated on 30 December that all military operations had been concluded after securing the area and pursuing fleeing militants, killing five of them. Mohammed Salalbi, senior leader of Libya Martyrs' Brigade, stated that the remaining BRSC fighters had retreated from Benghazi and arrived in Derna on 29 December, after misleading the LNA to make their way out. Merhi al-Houti of LNA meanwhile denied that they had retreated, claiming that the army had blocked the road to areas controlled by them and had liberated the entire region from the \\"terrorist groups\\". He added that clashes had ended.

Cross worked as a weaver, based in Darwen in Lancashire. He began to take an interest in trade union matters and joined the Blackburn and District Weavers' Association. He was elected vice-president of the Society and later president and trustee. During the time he served on the committee he was instrumental in promoting a system of mill representatives. It was around this time that Cross and a few more enthusiasts succeeded in forming the Blackburn and District Trades and Labour Council, which he chaired for seven years.Report of the 1925 Annual Trades Union Congress, p.346 In 1892, he was appointed secretary of the Darwen Weavers' Association, and two years later became secretary of the Blackburn Weavers' Association. In 1902, Cross was also elected as secretary of the United Textile Factory Workers' Association, a federation of most cotton workers' unions which focused on political matters; he held the post until his death. In September 1905, he accepted the position of Labour correspondent on the Board of Trade for the Blackburn Division of East Lancashire. The local weavers' associations were members of the Amalgamated Weavers' Association, and Cross was elected as its general secretary in March 1906. On receiving this appointment, Cross resigned from his position on the Trades Council. Efforts were made to induce him to continue in the office, but to no effect.Blackburn Times, 17 January 1925 Under his leadership, membership of the association rose from 88,000 to peak at 224,000 in 1921. He also oversaw the reduction of the working week from 52.5 to 48 hours for weavers.Edwin Hopwood, A History of the Lancashire Cotton Industry and the Amalgamated Weavers' Association, p.90 In May 1912 he was appointed to represent the textile trade unions upon the Advisory Committee for England under the National Insurance Act. A Liberal in his younger days, Cross remained a staunch Free Trader and in 1905 shared a Free Trade platform, under the auspices of the Blackburn branch of the Free Trade League, along with Lord George Hamilton and Conservative MP Harry Hornby. At the time the Conservative Party was committed nationally to Tariff reform, a policy to which the cotton industry was opposed. In a speech at the event, Cross summed up Protectionism in the phrase \\"Open your mouth, shut your eyes and see what Protection will send you\\".Blackburn Times, 14 January 1905 He concluded his appeal to the audience with the counsel \\"Don't be fooled\\". Cross remained active in local politics and regularly campaigned in support of greater Labour representation on the Blackburn Council. In was common knowledge locally that Cross would have been welcomed as a Parliamentary candidate, but his ambition was not in that direction. When the Labour Party first contested the nearby town of Clitheroe in 1902, the name of Cross was mentioned along with that of David Shackleton, who eventually won the seat with Cross as his election agent. Other constituencies attempted to woo him, but Cross would not stand. The high regard in which Cross was held in the Labour movement was evident at his funeral. Several of the mills in the local area stopped earlier than usual, so that operatives could be provided with an opportunity to witness the obsequies of their leader. All the blinds were drawn in a mark of respect. The majority of operatives' associations in Lancashire sent representatives and Sir David Shackleton was also present. In the gathering at the Co-Operative Hall following the interment, former Home Secretary Arthur Henderson provided the eulogy, describing Cross as a 'a man who could not be bought'.

Vernon in 1964 (Vernon, 1964, 1965).Vernon, P. E. (1964). The structure of human abilities. London: Methuen It was influenced by the theory of g factor. Vernon puts emphasis on the g factor in all the mental abilities. He extracted the g factor from an ability test, then found that could be divided into two separate parts. He named those two orthogonal group factors as verbal-educational factor (v:ed) and perceptual- mechanical skill factor (k:m). v:ed factor: verbal and educational abilities k:m factor: spatial, practical, and mechanical abilities This is a rough distinction between verbal and non-verbal intelligence measurement. verbal perceptual model Vernon also said that v:ed and k:m can represent different education and cultural experience. The v:ed factor may come from school life and k:m factor comes from skills forming in non-school time. Vernon considered that there might be a third special factor named mathematical skill, but it can be included in perceptual-mechanical (k:m) factor.  Difference from Horn and Cattell's Gf-Gc theory  Vernon's model about intelligence looks similar to the fluid-crystallized (Gf-Gc) intelligence theory because they both agree with g factor and have two more different dimensions on intelligence structure. In fact, Gf-Gc model has more broad factors such as special visualization (Gv), retrieval (Gr) or speed factor (Gs).Horn, J. L. (1985). Remodeling old models of intelligence. In B. B. Wolman (Ed.), Handbook of intelligence: Theories, measurements, and applications (pp. 267‚Äì300). New York: Wiley \\"One reason why the Horn-Cattell model has more broad group factors than Vernon's is simply that they analysed a very much larger and more carefully chosen battery of tests. This probably explains why the Vernon model does not contain any group factors corresponding to Cattell's Gr (and why it had to be added by Johnson and Bouchard, 2005, when they tried to fit the Vernon model to a much larger data set).\\" IQ and human intelligenceMackintosh, N.(1998).

A slab refers to the subducting lower plate. Although, some would characterize flat slab subduction as any shallowly dipping lower plate as in western Mexico. Flat slab subduction is associated with the pinching out of the asthenosphere, an inland migration of arc magmatism (magmatic sweep), and an eventual cessation of arc magmatism. The coupling of the flat slab to the upper plate is thought to change the style of deformation occurring on the upper plate's surface and form basement-cored uplifts like the Rocky Mountains. The flat slab also may hydrate the lower continental lithosphere and be involved in the formation of economically important ore deposits. During the subduction, a flat slab itself may be deformed, or buckling, causing sedimentary hiatus in marine sediments on the slab. The failure of a flat slab is associated with ignimbritic volcanism and the reverse migration of arc volcanism. Multiple working hypotheses about the cause of flat slabs are subduction of thick, buoyant oceanic crust (15‚Äì20 km) and trench rollback accompanying a rapidly overriding upper plate and enhanced trench suction. The west coast of South America has two of the largest flat slab subduction zones. Flat slab subduction is occurring at 10% of subduction zones.  History of idea  The idea has its beginnings in the late seventies. Seismic studies of the Andean margin seemed to show a zone of subhorizontal lower plate at a depth of 100 km. The Cornell-Carnigie debate between Cornell University geophysicists and workers at the Carnegie Institute of Washington centered on whether local deployments of seismometers would yield better results than looking at global (teleseismic) data. The Carnegie Institution seemed to have won the day with the local deployment imaging the flat slab where teleseismic data argued for a shallowing dipping slab with no near horizontal zone. The idea was taken up to explain the Laramide orogeny, as the flat slab subduction zones on the Andean margin are associated with more inboard surface deformation and magmatic gaps. Flat slab subduction is an active area of research; the causal mechanisms for its occurrence have not been sorted out.  Causal mechanisms and consequences of flat slab subduction  = Causal mechanisms = There are several working hypotheses for the initiation of flat slab subduction. The buoyant ridge hypothesis seems to be favored at the moment.  Subduction of buoyant oceanic crust  The subduction of bathymetric highs such as aseismic ridges, oceanic plateaus, and seamounts has been posited as the primary driver of flat slab subduction. The Andean flat slab subduction zones, the Peruvian slab and the Pampean (Chilean) flat slab, are spatially correlated with the subduction of bathymetric highs, the Nazca Ridge and the Juan Fernand√©z Ridge, respectively. The thick, buoyant oceanic crust lowers the density of the slab, and the slab fails to sink into the mantle after coming to a shallow depth (~100 km) due to the lessened density contrast. This is supported by the fact that all slabs under ~50 Ma. However, there are cases where aseismic ridges on the same scale as the Nazca Ridge are subducting normally, and cases where flat slabs are not associated with bathymetric highs. There are few flat slabs in the Western Pacific in areas associated with the subduction of bathymetric highs. Geodynamic modeling has called into question whether buoyant oceanic crust alone can generate flat slab subduction.  Trenchward motion of overriding plate with cratonic keel  Another explanation for slab flattening is the lateral movement of the overriding plate in a direction opposite to that of the downgoing slab. The overriding plate is often equipped with a cratonic keel of thick continental lithosphere which, if close enough to the trench, can impinge upon the flow in the mantle wedge. Trench suction is included in this causal mechanism. Trench suction is induced by the flow of the asthenosphere in the mantle wedge area; trench suction increases with subduction velocity, a decrease of the mantle wedge thickness, or an increase in the mantle wedge viscosity. Trench retreat is motion of the trench in a direction opposite to that of plate convergence thought to be related to the position of the trench along the larger subduction zone with retreat occurring near the edges of subduction zones. Modeling experiments have shown that if the cratonic lithosphere is thick and the trench retreats, the shutdown of the mantle wedge increases trench suction to an extent that the slab flattens. = Consequences =  Delay in the eclogitization  Eclogite is a dense (3.5 g/cu. cm), garnet-bearing rock that is formed as the oceanic crust subducts to zones of high pressure and temperature. The reaction that forms eclogite dehydrates the slab, and hydrates the mantle wedge above. The now denser slab more effectively sinks. A delay in eclogitization could arise through the subduction of zone thicker oceanic lithosphere without deeply penetrating faults. Oceanic crust is normally faulted at the trench rise by the bending of the plate as it subducts. This may be an effect or a cause of flat slab subduction, but it seems as though it is more likely an effect. A resumption of normally dipping subduction beyond the flat slab portion is associated with the eclogite reaction, and the amount of time needed to accumulate enough eclogite for the slab to start sinking may be what limits temporal scale of flat slab subduction.  Magmatic gaps and adakitic volcanism  As the subducting plate flattens there is an inboard migration in the magmatic arc that can be tracked. In the Chilean flat slab region (~31‚Äì32 degrees S), around 7‚Äì5 Ma there was an eastward migration, broadening and gradual shutdown down of the volcanic arc associated with slab flattening. This occurs as the previous magmatic arc position on the upper plate (100‚Äì150 km above subducting plate) is no longer aligned with the zone of partial melting above the flattening slab. The magmatic arc migrates to a new location that coincides with the zone of partial melting above the flattening slab. Magmatism before the Laramide orogeny migrated all the way to western South Dakota. Eventually, the magmatic activity above the flat slab may completely cease as the subducting plate and upper plate pinch out the mantle wedge. Upon the failure of the flat slab, the mantle wedge can again start circulating hot asthenosphere (1300 degrees C) in an area that has been heavily hydrated, but that had not produced any melt; this leads to widespread ignimbritic volcanism, which is seen in both the Andean flat slab effected regions and the western United States. Adakites are dacitic and andesitic magmas that are highly depleted in heavy rare-earth elements and high strontium/yttrium ratios and may be derived of melting of the oceanic crust. Adakites are thought to erupt or be emplaced during the transition from normally dipping subduction to flat subduction as the magmatic arc widens and migrates more inland. Adakitic rocks can be seen in modern Ecuador, a possible incipient flat slab zone, and in central Chile there are 10-5 Ma adakitic rocks. Thus, adakitic rocks could be used as marker of past episodes of flat slab subduction.  Surface deformation  Flat slabs are thought to result in zones of broad, diffuse deformation in the upper plate located far landward from the trench. Flat slab subduction is associated with basement-cored uplifts also known as \\"thick-skinned\\" deformation of the overriding plate like the Sierra Pampeanas in South America possibly associated with the subduction of the Juan Fernand√©z Ridge. These areas of basement-cored uplifts are visually correlated with flat slab subduction zones. In contrast, \\"thin-skinned\\" deformation is the normal mode of upper plate deformation, and does not involve basement rock. Crustal shortening is observed to extend farther inland than in normally dipping subduction zones; the Sierra Pampeanas are over 650 km east of the trench axis. Flat slabs have been used as an explanation for the Laramide Orogeny and the central Altiplano-Puna region. Another interesting feature that may be associated with the flat slab subduction of the Nazca Ridge is the Fitzcarrald arch located in the Amazonian Basin. The Fitzcarrald arch is a long-wavelength, linear topographic feature extending from eastern Peru to western Brazil beyond the Subandean thrust front into an undeformed area and rising ~600 masl. The Fitzcarrald arch has the effect of splitting the Amazonian Basin into three subbasins: northern Amazonian foreland basin, southern Amazonian foreland basin, and the eastern Amazonian foreland basin.  Seismicity  The shape of the flat slab is constrained through earthquakes within the subducting slab and the interface between the upper plate and the subducting slab. Flat slab zones along the Andean margin release 3‚Äì5 times more energy through upper plate earthquakes than adjacent, more steeply dipping subduction zones. Upper plate earthquake focal mechanisms indicate that stress is aligned parallel with motion of the plate, and that stress is transmitted high into the upper plate from the lower. The reason for this enhanced seismicity is more effective coupling of the upper and lower plates. In normal subduction zones the coupling interface, the area in which the two plates are in close proximity, between the two plates is ~100‚Äì200 km long, but in flat slab subduction zones the coupling interface is much longer, 400‚Äì500 km. Although the lower lithosphere of the upper deforms plastically, numerical modeling has shown stress can be transmitted to crustal regions which behave in a brittle fashion. Along the subducting plate seismicity is more variable, especially intermediate-depth earthquakes. The variability may be controlled by the thickness of the crust and how efficiently it can release water. Thick crust that is not as deeply fractured by trench rise normal faulting may not dehydrate rapidly enough to induce intermediate-depth earthquakes. The Peruvian flat slab lacks significant intermediate-depth earthquakes and is associated with the subduction of the ~17 km thick Nazca Ridge.  Andean flat slabs  In the late seventies early research recognized the unique nature of the two large flat slab subduction zones along the Andean margin of South America. Two large and one smaller current flat slab subduction segments exist along the Andean margin: the Peruvian, Pampean, and the Bucaramanga. Three Cenozoic flat slab segment are also known: Altiplano, Puna, and Payenia. The Peruvian flat slab is located between the Gulf of Guayaquil (5 degrees S) and Arequipa (14 degrees S), extending ~1500 km along the strike of the subduction zone. The Peruvian flat slab is the largest in the world, and extends ~700 km inboard from the trench axis. The subducting plate starts at a dip of 30 degrees then flattens out at a depth of 100 km under the Eastern Cordillera and Subandean zone. The segment is visually correlated with the subduction of the Nazca Ridge, an aseismic ridge with thickened crust. The second highest zone in the Andes, Cordillera Blanca, is associated with the Peruvian flat slab segment and uplift of basement-cored blocks. Volcanism in the area ceased in the Late Miocene (11-5 Ma). Plate reconstructions time the collision of the Nazca Ridge with the subduction zone at 11.2 Ma at 11 degree S, which implies that the northern extent of the Peruvian flat slab may require some other subducted feature like an oceanic plateau. A putative subducted plateau, the Inca Plateau, has been argued for. The Pampean or Chilean flat slab segment is located between 27 degrees S and 33 degrees S, extending ~550 km along the strike of the subduction zone. The Pampean flat slab similarly extends ~700 km inboard from the trench axis. The segment is visually correlated with the Juan Fernandez Ridge, and the highest peak in the Andes, the non-volcanic Aconcagua (6961 m). This area has undergone the same \\"thick-skinned\\" deformation, leading to the high mountain peaks. The Bucaramanga segment was recognized in early eighties from limited seismological evidence. The segment is encompassed between 6 and 9 degrees N in Colombia, extending ~350 km along the strike of the subduction zone.  Other flat slabs  There are several other flat slab segments that warrant a mention: * Alaskan: 145‚Äì150 degrees W along the Aleutian Trench associated with the Yakutat microplate * Costa Rica: 82‚Äì84 degrees W associated with the Cocos Ridge * Mexico: 96‚Äì100 degrees W associated with the Tenhuantepec Ridge * Cascadian, United States: 46‚Äì49 degrees N associated with the subduction of young oceanic crust  Economic geology  Subduction of thick oceanic crust could be linked with the metallogenesis of copper and gold deposits. The 10 largest young (<18 Ma) gold deposits in South America are associated with flat slab segments. Enhanced metallogenesis may be caused by the cessation of magmatism in the arc allowing the conservation of sulfur-rich volatiles. The failure of the putative flat slab under western North America may have been vital in producing Carlin-type gold deposits.  Early Earth subduction  Early Earth's mantle was hotter and it has been proposed that flat slab subduction was the dominant style. Computer modeling has shown that an increase in oceanic plate buoyancy associated with enhanced oceanic crust production would have been counteracted by decreased mantle viscosity, so flat slab subduction would not have been dominant or non-existent.

Released by unnamed Erdoƒüan supporters as a WordPress.com blog, the files heavily criticised Davutoƒülu for disobeying Erdoƒüan's political agenda. The release of the files were widely attributed to sparking the events that would eventually lead to Davutoƒülu being ousted as Prime Minister. The name \\"Pelican files\\" is a reference to the 1993 political thriller The Pelican Brief. The files were released at a time when relations between Davutoƒülu and Erdoƒüan had deteriorated sharply. Rumours that Davutoƒülu had submitted his resignation as Prime Minister were followed by the AKP Central Executive Decision Committee (MKYK) revoking Davutoƒülu's right to appoint provincial and district party representatives. On 4 May 2016, a day earlier than planned, Davutoƒülu and Erdoƒüan held a meeting at the Presidential Complex. Although it was initially dubbed as a 'routine meeting' by presidential staff, the meeting was followed shortly after by a decision by the AKP to hold an Extraordinary Congress in 2016 in which Davutoƒülu would not stand as a leadership candidate. The publication and aim of the \\"memorandum\\" was predicted by blogger Fuat Avni. On 19 April 2016 he wrote that Erdoƒüan was planning a \\"coup against Davutoƒülu\\" and that the \\"pelican\\" of \\"Berat and Serhat\\" (a reference to Erdoƒüan's son-in-law and his brother) was about to fly.The Pelican Brief: Erdoƒüanist blog seeks to topple Davutoƒülu, an English translation http://theturkishsun.com/the-pelican-brief-erdoganist-blog-seeks- to-topple-davutoglu-an-english-translation-18140/ It is described as a palace coup d'√©tat in Turkish social mediahttp://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/siyaset/527169/_4_Mayis_Saray_darbesi.html and other sources.http://odatv.com/bu-saray-darbesi- nedir-.toglanlari-0505161200.htmlhttp://t24.com.tr/yazarlar/bilinmeyen/davutogluna- saray-darbesini-mhpye-yargi-darbesi-izler-mi-25-maddede-akp-tarihi-ve- ihtimaller,14484 Background The Justice and Development Party (AKP), founded by the current President and former Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan, has been in power ever since winning the 2002 general elections by a landslide. In the 2014 presidential election, Erdoƒüan ran as the AKP's candidate and was elected president with 51.79% of the vote, naming Davutoƒülu as his successor as party leader and Prime Minister. Many commentators claimed that Davutoƒülu would take a submissive approach as Prime Minister while Erdoƒüan continued pursuing his political agenda as president, including the establishment of an executive presidency that would boost his powers. The Pelican files released in April 2016 detailed disagreements between Erdoƒüan and Davutoƒülu on several issues concerning both national and inner-party political developments. Items The 27 items detailed in the Pelican files are listed below. #Erdoƒüan opposed and stopped the enacting of a 'transparency law', a piece of legislation that Davutoƒülu had wanted to implement shortly after becoming Prime Minister. #Davutoƒülu was allegedly in favour of the four former AKP government ministers, namely Egemen Baƒüƒ±≈ü, Zafer √áaƒülayan, Muammer G√ºler and Erdoƒüan Bayraktar, being sent to the Supreme Court for their role in the 2013 government corruption scandal. AKP Members of Parliament later voted against the motion to send the four ministers to the Supreme Court after Erdoƒüan instructed them to block the motion. #Davutoƒülu was responsible for the parliamentary candidacy of Hakan Fidan, Undersecretary of the National Intelligence Organisation (Mƒ∞T) for the June 2015 general election, which was overturned by Erdoƒüan and resulted in Fidan being re-instated as Mƒ∞T Undersecretary after he withdrew his candidacy. #Davutoƒülu allowed the Dolmabah√ße Statement, a result of negotiations during the Solution process with Kurdish rebels, to be released in public. Following public criticism by Erdoƒüan, an important section of the Statement which established an 'Oversight Committee' was abandoned, followed shortly after by the entire solution process altogether. #Davutoƒülu supported Deputy Prime Minister B√ºlent Arƒ±n√ß, who publicly criticised Erdoƒüan over interfering with the Dolmabah√ße Statement. #Relations also allegedly soured due to Davutoƒülu giving press statements and interviews to media and news outlets that had been known for criticising Erdoƒüan. #Tensions between the two politicians after the June elections rose after Davutoƒülu claimed that the people had rejected Erdoƒüan's call for an executive presidency. #It was alleged that Davutoƒülu supported Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) leader Devlet Bah√ßeli after the June 2015 election resulted in a hung parliament, who had claimed that the MHP's precondition for a coalition agreement with the AKP would be for Erdoƒüan's family (and in particular his son, Bilal Erdoƒüan) to go on trial for alleged corruption. #A general disagreement between Davutoƒülu and Erdoƒüan over whether the AKP should have pushed for a coalition agreement or early elections after the inconclusive June 2015 vote was also included in the files. #Davutoƒülu was accused of establishing his own media network, including a newspaper, that would be supportive of him. #Davutoƒülu was also accused of censoring some pro- Erdoƒüan media material. #It emerged that the establishment of the pro- Davutoƒülu news outlets would be financed by an undisclosed allowance paid to the Office of the Prime Minister directly from the national budget. #It was further alleged that Davutoƒülu and Erdoƒüan had argued over who would stand for election to the AKP's Central Executive Decision Committee (MKYK) in the party's 5th Ordinary Congress in September 2015. Erdoƒüan supporter Binali Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m had been collecting signatures for a potential leadership bid up until Davutoƒülu backed down to Erdoƒüan's demands. #Disagreements over Davutoƒülu's attempts to lift political immunities from prosecution, as well as his decision to consult the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) on the proposals resulted in tensions with Erdoƒüan to increase further. #Erdoƒüan allegedly strongly protested Davutoƒülu for claiming that his government could restart the Solution process if the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) reverted to the situation in 2013. #Furthermore, Davutoƒülu was criticised for not opposing an AKP MP who claimed that 'everything would be alright if the Parallel state (G√ºlen Movement) reverted to its factory values.' #Davutoƒülu allegedly did not voice criticism over European Parliament President Martin Schulz calling Erdoƒüan 'authoritarian' in response to Erdoƒüan's calls for a German video criticising him to be censored. #Similarly, Erdoƒüan blamed Davutoƒülu for not speaking up for the Presidency when Schulz claimed that Davutoƒülu, as Prime Minister, would be recognised as the official representative of the Turkish Government in negotiations with the European Union #The Presidency alleged that it was not consulted by Davutoƒülu during the European migrant crisis negotiations for visa-free entry by Turkish nationals to the European Union. Davutoƒülu was also accused of not criticising European media outlets that had voiced scepticism of Erdoƒüan. #Competition between Davutoƒülu and Erdoƒüan had been reported over who would get to meet US President Barack Obama during an official visit to the United States #Davutoƒülu allegedly attempted to recruit some of the AKP's most notorious social media trolls (known as 'AK Trolls') to support him against Erdoƒüan #Advisors and journalists close to Davutoƒülu were accused of supporting the restarting of negotiations with the PKK. #Davutoƒülu and Erdoƒüan allegedly disagreed on whether arrested journalists Can D√ºndar and Erdem G√ºl should be tried while in custody. #Davutoƒülu invited Arƒ±n√ß to a 'public opening' rally in Manisa shortly before the June 2015 vote. #Davutoƒülu's relations with Erdoƒüan further deteriorated after he visited the Taraf newspaper, known to be critical of Erdoƒüan #Erdoƒüan allegedly blocked some of Davutoƒülu's preferred appointments to high-ranking bureaucratic positions. #Davutoƒülu allegedly angered Erdoƒüan when he claimed that the 1,100 academics arrested for signing a resolution calling for peace in the south- east of Turkey should not have been taken into custody. Aftermath The release of the Pelican files were seen as proof of several earlier media reports of growing rifts between Davutoƒülu and Erdoƒüan, though the Presidency denied any involvement with its release. In early May, the AKP's Central Executive Decision Committee (MKYK) voted to revoke the leader's ability to appoint provincial and district party representatives and instead delegated that power to the MKYK as a whole. On 3 May, Davutoƒülu gave a speech at an AKP parliamentary group meeting that was interpreted by the press as a 'resignation speech' due to its short length. Rumours emerged that Davutoƒülu had submitted his resignation to the Presidency earlier. On 4 May 2016, Davutoƒülu met with Erdoƒüan at the Presidential Complex, a day earlier than the usual Thursday weekly meeting. The meeting lasted for 1 hour and 40 minutes, after which neither the Presidency or the Prime Minister's Office made a statement, although the Presidency claimed that the meeting was 'routine'. Shortly after, it was declared that Davutoƒülu would assemble the party MKYK before making a public speech at another parliamentary group meeting of AKP MPs. At the same time, it was reported that the party had taken the decision to call an Extraordinary Congress.

Developed and published by Bossa Studios, the game entered early access on PC through Steam in mid- July 2017.. Following the conclusion of the \\"End of the world\\" in-game event, Worlds Adrift was discontinued on July 26, 2019 by Bossa Studios, who cited the game being no longer commercially viable as the reason for its shutdown.https://support.bossastudios.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001675557-The- End-of-Worlds-Adrift  Gameplay  Players could explore the game's vast open world of floating islands, where all in-game objects have their own weight and real-time physics. Worlds Adrift allowed the player to harvest resources and free-build an airship of any size and shape to traverse the world. Due to the game's focus on physics, features of the ship, such as the number and placement of hull material, propulsion systems and where the player stood on the ship in flight, would have an effect on the ship's handling, fuel consumption and speed. Ships were constructed by creating a \\"ship frame\\" using an in-game program called \\"3DS Shipmax,\\" then attaching various parts to the frame once it is built. The various floating islands present in the game that could be explored were created by players in an external software engine called Worlds Adrift Island Creator that came bundled with the game itself and could be installed as a separate program. Bossa Studios had hinted at the presence of a planetary core miles beneath the orbiting clouds, but any player attempting to travel towards this would die long before coming close to anything resembling a core.  Plot  The game's plot was fragmented and incomplete with tiny snippets of background information about the world and its history being learned from scanning various in-game objects. The game hints that the floating islands distributed throughout the game were once part of a planetary crust, but a cataclysm shattered the planet into multiple islands that floated through the atmosphere. The islands float due to an \\"Atlas Crystal\\" that is embedded in the islands' impenetrable rock. Atlas crystals were minerals once mined by the ancient precursor civilisation referenced in Worlds Adrift's lore and were valued for their anti-gravity properties. A previous race that built the various in-game ruins is hinted at, but there was no contact between the players and any surviving members of this precursor civilisation.  Development  Worlds Adrift was announced by Bossa Studios on December 19, 2014 by Bossa Studios' founder Henrique Olifiers. The concept for the game came from a game jam event. The game's complex persistent world is run by a cloud-based operating system called SpatialOS created by a UK-based company named Improbable. SpatialOS allows a simulated world, with a day and night cycle, to be inhabited by millions of complex entities in a real-time environment. The program's \\"worlds\\" can span massive regions of digital space (processing power per cubed kilometer ratio), contain millions of individually simulated entities with complex behavior, and run across thousands of servers in the cloud.  Reception  Worlds Adrift was once referred to as \\"The Minecraft for a new generation\\" by Angus Morrison of Edge magazine. Brandin Tyrrel at IGN also cited the game as \\"Worlds Adrift is one of the most ambitious physics game I've ever seen.\\" The game was nominated for the \\"Creativity\\" and \\"Heritage\\" awards at The Independent Game Developers' Association Awards 2018.

Constituted at the end of 1945, the division was created on February 1, 1946 and was dissolved during the Indochina War in June 1948; it did not serve in Indochina as an entire division. History Following the end of World War II, France planned to create two Airborne Divisions, organized similarly to United States airborne formations. The first to be created, the 24th Airborne Division, was dissolved after only three months due to a chronic lack of troops. The infantry of the 24th DAP and its 24th CEP were transferred to the 25th Motorized Infantry Division, which was used to form the 25th Airborne Division on February 1, 1946. The new division was formed in southwest France with its headquarters at Bayonne.Histoire des parachutistes fran√ßais, pp. 76‚Äì77 From its creation, it suffered from shortcomings in manpower and equipment ‚Äì for air transport, the division had only the Junkers Ju 52, Douglas C-47 Dakota, and the SNCASE SE.161 Languedoc, the last intended for towing gliders because it was not suitable for airborne troops.In Histoire des parachutistes fran√ßais, page 110. The troops of the division included units that had fought in World War II ‚Äì the 1st Parachute Chasseur Regiment (RCP), the 2nd Parachute Chasseur Regiment, which had just merged with the 3rd Parachute Chasseur Regiment and the 4th R.I.A.

In order to strengthen French control in Algeria and prevent an uprising, the 25th Division was transferred there in April 1946. The division headquarters was in Algiers and then Philippeville, the 1st RCP in the S√©tif area, the 2nd RCP in the Constantine area between Philippeville, Bone, and Guelma, and the 1st RICAP near Algiers.Histoire des parachutistes fran√ßais, pp. 78‚Äì80.La 25e DAP, pp. 71‚Äì72Structure of the 25th Airborne Division, 1947Unable to develop as planned, it was reorganized multiple times, first in September 1946, when its structure was revised to include three Independent Airborne Groups (GAP). GAPs 1 and 2 were combat units, while GAP 3 would become responsible for training in France. GAP 1 was located around Constantine, GAP 2 in Morocco, and GAP 3 would form during 1947 in the 5th Military Region in France. The division headquarters was relocated to Pau while a deputy in North Africa was appointed.La 25e DAP page 102. The division commander took command of the Airborne Troops Training Center in Pau, but this arrangement was brief, as in November the training center and the 11th Choc Battalion were attached to the inspector of the Airborne Troops in Paris. The unit was reorganized a final time in February 1947 to prepare for the formation of GAP 3 and the detachment of elements to the intensifying Indochina War. The 1st RCP formed the infantry of GAP 1, although two of its battalions had already been deployed to Indochina, the 42nd Demi-Brigade formed that of GAP 2, and GAP 3 was formed later that yearIn Histoire des parachutistes fran√ßais, pages 115. from the 18th BIP, the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd RCP, and the 5th BPIC, which were part of its subordinate 43rd Demi-Brigade.In Histoire des parachutistes fran√ßais, pages 120.

It is usually held in late September, and usually attracts more than 80,000 visitorscontent over the 5-day event. Each International Plowing Match takes years of planning, and months of labour to prepare for the final event. It has several attractions in which visitors can go to, including the plow fields, Tented City, and the RV park. A transportation network of tractors and wagons carry visitors to and from different areas of the site. The IPM is organized and run by the Ontario Plowmen's Association (OPA). The 2016 IPM in Minto occupied over 1,200 acres, and had 500 exhibitors.  History  Plowing Matches have been part of Ontario agricultural history for over a century. Early events were sponsored by Agricultural Societies. A feature of the first provincial exhibition, the 1846 Provincial Agricultural Fair of Canada West in Toronto, was a plowing match, held at farm near Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenue. The Ontario Plowmen's Association was formed in 1911. The first International Plowing Match was held in 1913. Held at Sunnybrook farm near Toronto, the event featured as entries 31 single-furrow horse-drawn plows with no classes dedicated to tractors. By 1916 their influence had grown so that the representation of horse-drawn plows and tractors was nearly balanced with 30 plows and 25 tractors used during competition. There was no Tented City until the year 1917. The IPM has been held every year since 1913, with the exception of 1918 and 1942‚Äì1945 which were not held due to WW2.  Plowing  Visitors can see competitors plow in the field. There are several different classes of plowing, taking place in different fields. The two main classes are horse plowing, and tractor plowing. Some different plowing classes for tractors include depend on how many furrows the plow has. Other tractor plowing classes include antique plowing, and 4H (youth) plowing. Plowing is \\"judged for straightness, firmness, evenness, depth, shape and uniformity. A good plowed furrow must be straight with a smooth trough and clean, even sides.\\"  Tented City  The Tented City is the most popular attraction at the IPM. It is where visitors can learn about agricultural life, and exhibitors showcase their products to the public. It consists of a series of streets, roads, and avenues, that are created specifically for the match, . The streets are for visitors to walk through and see the exhibits. In-between each street is a service road where vehicles with a red parking pass can drive through. Service roads also have hydro poles to provide power to the city, and give exhibitors more access to their site. The avenues of the city run perpendicular to the streets and service roads. They also have hydro poles, and are accessible to both vehicles and pedestrians. All the streets and service roads are named in numerical order, while the avenues are named after major sponsors of the IPM. The city has several entrances surrounding the perimeter where visitors pay for admission. Tented City continues to grow each year, and its land area is approximately 100 acres.  RV Park  The RV park is an optional place for visitors to stay overnight if they plan to attend the IPM for more than one day. The RV park provides visitors with a site for a camp trailer or motorhome, it also provides water and electricity. Washrooms are also located in different areas in the park. Inside the RV park every year is an entertainment tent. The entertainment tent offers music and live shows to anyone registered in the park. The RV park is located either beside, or very close to Tented City. The RV park often takes up the same land area as Tented City, and occasionally has been bigger.  Queen of the Furrow  Every year, an Ontario Queen of the Furrow is chosen to represent the Ontario Plowmen's Association and to promote the next year's International Plowing Match. The Queen also travels around Ontario promoting agriculture. A new Queen of the Furrow is chosen every year during the IPM at the Queen's Banquet. All contestants begin as Queens representing their County before they can represent Ontario.  IPM 100th controversy  In 2013, the International Plowing match had its 100th anniversary celebration in Perth County. It is disputed whether or not 2013 should have marked the 100th year for the IPM. Some argue that since the match was canceled during war time, the match in 2017 should celebrate the 100th anniversary. Others argue that the first International Plowing Match was in 1913, so 2013 should be 100th celebration for the IPM. In result of the controversy, the 100th anniversary celebration was held in Perth County in 2013, and the 100th IPM during the 2017 match in Huron County.  Notable Visitors  Many political figures in the Canadian Government have made visits to the International Plowing Match. Many of these figures are involved in the opening and closing ceremonies. Justin Trudeau made a visit to the 2014 IPM in Simcoe County, and Kathleen Wynne made an appearance during the 2016 IPM in Wellington County. Due to its importance in rural Ontario, the legislature suspends sitting for two days so all party leaders can attend the IPM. By tradition, all party leaders who visit the International Plowing Match attempt plowing.  Past sites  A few of the past sites are listed here. * 2019 Verner, West Nipissing, Ontario * 2018 Village of Pain Court (Chatham Kent, Ontario) * 2017 Walton, Huron County, Ontario * 2016 Town of Minto, Wellington County. The 2016 IPM in Minto occupied over 1,200 acres, and had 500 exhibitors. The RCMP Musical Ride was a feature. * 2015 United Counties of Stormont, Dundas & Glengarry * 2014 Ivy, Simcoe County * 2013 Mitchell, Perth County. During the 2013 a severe rain storm went through during the night. Officials were forced to shut down Tented City the following morning on the very last day of the match. Tented City remained closed for the rest of the day due to severe flooding. This resulted in not having the official closing ceremonies that were originally supposed to happen that day. The rain also left hundreds of people stranded inside the RV park due to the amount of mud. Some visitors spent days longer in the RV park before being able to leave. * 2012 Roseville, Region of Waterloo * 2011 Hawkesbury, Prescott-Russell County * 2010 St. Thomas, Elgin County * 2009 Earlton, District of Temiskaming. First IPM in Northern Ontario. Had 80,000 visitors, 600 exhibitors and 2,100 serviced RV lots on a 1,000 acre venue * 2008 Teeswater. About 84,000 people attended. Premier Dalton McGuinty opened the event. Prominent visitors included Tsuneto Sasaki, Japanese Trade Commissioner, John Tory, and Ontario's Lieutenant Governor David C. Onley * 2004 Scott & Tracy Davison, Meaford, Grey County (Same site as 1987 match) * 1991 Enniskillen Township, Lambton County * 1988 Stratford, Perth County * 1987 John Lowe Family & neighbouring farms, Meaford, Grey County The 1983 Ottawa Carlton event had an attendance of 142,000 for a 5-day event. 600 exhibitors occupied a 100-acre \\"tented city\\". Two hundred plowmen were in competition. The event was opened by federal Minister of Agriculture, Eugene Whelan. Also attending were Ontario Minister of Agriculture Dennis Timbrell, various local MPs, and the regional chair. The opening parade took 25 minutes to pass a given point. There were 200 competing plowmen. A 60 foot long corn mural, created for the 1979 Chatham-Kent IPM, was inadvertently destroyed in 2013. The 1978 event near Wingham was opened by astronaut Neil Armstrong to about 30,000 first day attendees. Overall attendance was 220000, a record to that date. The 1966 match near Seaforth was famous for mud, as torrential rains and high winds lashed the site. The IPM was opened by the Federal Minister of Agriculture. Ontario Premier John Robarts visited. Paid admission was 50,000, despite the weather. The 1936 match near Cornwall was a 4-day event; 40,000 people visited on one day. The matches were spread over 40 farms. Over 175 acres of land were plowed during competition. Electricity was not generally available in the area, but lines were run especially for the event. The mayor of Cornwall hosted a dinner for over 700 participating plowmen.

Originally an office building known as the Canal Building, it was constructed in 1963, and was the first major new building constructed in Georgetown in 50 years. The structure was purchased by two local real estate development companies in 2008 and converted to a hotel. The renovation won multiple awards. The hotel, branded as and managed by Capella Hotels and Resorts, opened in 2013 as the Cappella Hotel. The developers sold the property to Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, which rebranded the hotel as the Rosewood Washington, D.C. The hotel has 61 rooms in total, including 12 suites and 49 standard guest rooms. The hotel has about of interior space. The hotel offers the 70-seat Grill Room for dining, and the 26-seat Rye Bar for relaxation and consumption of alcohol. Both the Grill Room and Rye Bar have outdoor seating which overlooks the canal. A rooftop cocktail lounge is available during clement weather, and a rooftop pool offers both indoor and outdoor swimming. Construction of the building and early use In 1961, D.C.-area advertising executive Henry Kaufman and local insurance company executives Maury Young, Eugene Young, Jr., and Dr. Robert Young purchased a vacant lot at 1050 31st Street NW in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. They hired local architect Vlastimil Koubek to design a five- story office building to house their businesses. Koubek initially proposed a Modernist building with an all-glass first floor and exposed stone upper floors. The District of Columbia Zoning Commission approved the design, but the United States Commission of Fine Arts‚Äîwhich had approval authority over construction in the area under authority granted to it by the Old Georgetown Act‚Äîrejected the design as too modern. By early summer 1962, Koubek had revised his design. The structure was now a spare, Federalist-style red brick building with small windows. The Commission of Fine Arts approved this design, but the Zoning Commission did not after arguing that Koubek's second effort was too far removed from the design they had originally approved. The zoning board also was unhappy with the way Koubek intended to conceal the mechanical and HVAC equipment on the roof. Koubek eventually won approval from the zoning commission, and construction began in March 1963. The building was a \\"first\\" in several ways: It was the first non-Modernist structure Koubek ever designed, it was the first major new building constructed in Georgetown in the past 50 years, and it was the first new office building constructed in Georgetown in 100 years. Named the Canal Building, the structure was erected by the George A. Fuller Company and had of usable interior space. It also had three underground parking levels which could accommodate 50 vehicles. The structure, which was freestanding, had windows and views on all four sides, and about of the lot in back of the building fronted on the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal. The building was first occupied in August 1963. The Young & Simon, Inc. insurance firm occupied one floor, and the Henry J. Kaufman & Associates advertising agency occupied another floor (expanding to two floors in 1967). In 1977, the Association of Trial Lawyers of America (ATLA) purchased the structure and moved its headquarters from Boston, Massachusetts, to Washington, D.C. The ATLA rededicated the building under the name \\"Leonard M. Ring Law Center\\". In 2007, the ATLA purchased a new building at 777 Sixth Street NW for $105 million, and vacated the building.; Cappella Hotel =Acquisition and renovation= In January 2008, a local D.C. real estate development company, Castleton Holdings Inc., purchased the Canal Building for $18.3 million ($ in dollars). About January 2009, another local real estate development firm, ICG Properties LLC, took a 50 percent equity investment in the property. By April 2009, Castleton and ICG were in talks with a \\"high-end, boutique [hotel] operator\\" as a tenant in the building. In March 2010, the other party was revealed to be Capella Hotels and Resorts, the owner and operator of luxury boutique hotels in New York City, Japan, Mexico, Russia, and Thailand. The three companies tentatively announced they would renovate the building into a 48-room hotel beginning in 2011. The D.C. hotel would become the chain's flagship hotel. Obtaining financing during the Great Recession proved difficult. Castleton and ICG took on a third equal equity partner, the Indonesian investment firm Point Ford Management Ltd., which provided part of the $45 million ($ in dollars) in financing needed for the renovation. (The deal was Point Ford's first American hotel investment.) The remainder of the financing came from PNC Financial Services. The renovation plans drawn up by the architectural firms of Mancini‚Ä¢Duffy and Peter Silling & Associates called for 12 suites and 27 standard guest rooms. Additional architectural work was provided by Michael Winstanley Architects & Planners. Each guest room featured trayed ceilings, cove lighting, millwork manufactured in Europe, hardwood parquet flooring from a demolished French ch√¢teau, and laser-cut marble sinks, tiles, and decorative work. Each suite also had a fireplace. Each guest room was unique, with its own color and design scheme and unique furnishings (designed by Silling & Associates). Furnishings in each room included one-of-a-kind artworks; silk curtains; custom, hand-upholstered furniture; and glass-enclosed rainfall showers. Each guest room contained a television, but in suites these were mirror TVs. Anticipated hotel amenities included an indoor bar, rooftop cocktail lounge, fitness center, \\"signature\\" restaurant, outdoor dining area along the canal, spa, indoor and outdoor swimming pool, and wine cellar with attached wine bar. The lobby of the hotel could be accessed only by an electronic key. The lobby was designed to look like the living room of a wealthy home, with built-in bookshelves, chandelier, and floor-to-ceiling fireplace. Initially, the hotel was due to deliver in the fall of 2012 in order to be available for the second inauguration of Barack Obama, but did not. In December 2012, the developers expected the hotel to open in February 2013, but missed this target date as well. The hotel's $50 million ($ in dollars) renovation was finally completed in March 2013. The Washington Business Journal cited the renovation as its \\"Best Deal: Rehab/Reuse\\" for 2013. The Washington Chapter of the American Institute of Architects gave the project its Award of Merit. The project also received the Award of Merit ‚Äì Best Renovation/Adaptive Re-use from the Maryland/DC Chapter of the National Association of Industrial and Office Properties, the Award of Merit ‚Äì Commercial/Residential Renovation (More Than $4 Million) from the Metro Washington Chapter of the American Building College, and the Excellence in Craftsmanship Award for Lighting Systems and the Star Award for Excellence in the Face of Adversity from the Washington Building Congress. The property was assessed at about $31 million ($ in dollars) after the renovation. =Operation= Room rates at the Capella Hotel were about $600 ($ in dollars) a night in 2013. The hotel won some early high praise. CNN called it one of 2013's hottest new hotels and Forbes Life magazine placed it in its list of the top 20 hotel properties in the United States. However, the Capella Hotel struggled in its first year of operation. Unable to open by the 2013 presidential inauguration, the hotel missed an opportunity to introduce itself to many luxury travelers. Occupancy rates in the months following the hotel's opening averaged between 30 and 50 percent, although they later rose to 80 percent by May 2014. Management felt the hotel was still three months behind in meeting its targets as summer 2014 approached. The hotel also failed to generate much local buzz, and began opening its doors to the public for limited events (such as trunk shows and cocktail mixing classes) and giving the public access to its formerly-exclusive rooftop lounge. Without a ballroom or meeting space, the hotel also could not attract large numbers of travelers who might give the hotel excellent word-of-mouth. The AAA gave Cappella Hotel four diamonds out of five in 2014. The hotel retained that rating in 2015. But Forbes Travel Guide (formerly known as the Mobil Guide) declined to give the hotel either four or five stars in 2015, and did not add it to its \\"recommended\\" list. Rosewood In March 2016, after three years in operation, Castleton Holdings and ICG Properties agreed to sell their interest in the hotel building to CTF Georgetown Hotel LLC, an affiliate of Hong Kong- based CTF Development Inc. The hotel sold for an \\"astounding\\" $65 million ($ in dollars), or $1.3 million ($ in dollars) per guest room. This was nearly three-and-a-half times the per-guest room price of The Ritz-Carlton, Georgetown (which sold in December 2015 for $32.5 million ($ in dollars)), almost five-and-a-half times the per-guest room price of the Washington Marriott Georgetown (which sold in September 2015 for $113 million ($ in dollars)), and more than two-and-three-quarters the per-guest room price of The St. Regis Washington, D.C. (which sold in July 2015 for $82 million ($ in dollars)). CTF Georgetown Hotel hired Rosewood Hotels & Resorts, a Dallas- based luxury hotel and resort company, to brand and manage the property. The Rosewood opened on April 21, 2016, making it the first Rosewood property in the Washington metropolitan area. Rosewood Hotels said it intended to make only cosmetic changes to the hotel.

Around 1905 the house had another floor added, and it is during this building work that sightings of the \\"Ghosts of Glasshayes\\" are first reported. Officers from local regiments used the hotel during both world wars, and numerous celebrity guests during later decades included Margaret Thatcher and the Beatles. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had, by the early 20th century, become a regular visitor to \\"the Grand.\\" It was during a stay at the hotel in March 1912 that he sketched out designs for a third storey extension and altered front facade to the building.Griffith, Carolyn. \\"Campaigner says hotel's writer link should secure landmark building\\" Lymington Times, Sep 15th, 2017 Work on the extension began in Autumn of that year, and the building as it survives today is a near perfect expression of Doyle's plans.Glasshayes House: the 1912 extension of The Lyndhurst Grand Hotel, The Arthur Conan Doyle Encyclopedia, 2017 Lyndhurst Park Hotel In 1970 the house was bought as an ongoing concern by Forestdale Hotels Ltd and renamed as the Lyndhurst Park Hotel, receiving multiple unsympathetic extensions throughout the 1970s and 1980s which developed it into a 60-bed hotel. In 2014 the hotel was purchased by the St James Hotel group, and later that year it was closed and bought by developers PegasusLife, who plan to demolish the property in order to build retirement flats on the land, despite local opposition. Prior to closure it employed 13 full-time staff and 8 casual workers.Hampshire-based Pegasus Life plans to knock down 60-bed Lyndhurst Park Hotel and replace with flats, Bournemouth Daily Echo, 30 Apr 2015Loss Making Hampshire Hotel to Close, Insider MediaTourism Bosses Speak of their Shock over Hotel Closure Announcement, Southern Daily EchoBrent Owned Forestdale Hotels Collapses, Insider MediaLyndhurst Park Hotel to Close after making Losses, ITV News Folklore =The Ghosts of Glasshayes= According to local tradition, the building is haunted by a number of ghosts, known as the \\"Ghosts of Glasshayes.\\" The most sighted is that of Richard Fitzgeorge de Stacpoole, the first Duc de Stacpoole. Sightings have been reported by builders working on extensions to the site, both at the beginning of the 20th century and in the 1970s, apparently berating and sometimes attacking them for disturbing his property. Supposedly, every year on the night of his death (July 7) strange music can be heard in certain rooms, and folklore has it that this is from a grand ball that the Duc holds annually for the dead.New Forest Hauntings, Historic-UK, 2016 During the 1912 extensions, workers on the site added the seven \\"Glasshayes Devil Squares\\" over the entrance, each one signifying a separate ghost sighting during construction. Other ghost sightings have included that of Mrs Buck, for whom Glasshayes was built (and who died there in 1826) and of a chamber maid, who (according to legend) hanged herself after an affair with a cook. The reputation for hauntings is thought to what first attracted Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, a committed Spiritualist who held seances in the hotel. =Smuggling= From its earliest incarnation Glasshayes has been notable for its eccentric \\"octagonal tower,\\" built as an original feature by George Buck to serve as a lookout for local smuggling operations (common within the New Forest area). When the Duc de Stacpoole purchased the property he continued to run the area smuggling ring from the house, also using his yacht \\"the Gipsey Queen\\" to transport illicit goods. A raid was carried out by excise agents in 1847, during which the Duc barricaded himself into the octagonal tower with a military saber, and the siege was widely reported in national papers of the time. The house continued to be used for smuggling activities during its years of non-residence after the Duc's death, but seems to have ceased the association from Charles Castleman's tenure beginning 1862. Local tradition reports numerous smuggling caches and hollows throughout the original portion of the property (particularly in the floor and behind the wooden paneling of the surviving octagonal room). There are even stories of a sealed up network of old tunnels connecting the house with nearby pubs, for the easy transport of illegal liquor.

Designed for overseas service and armed with four guns, the ships were smaller and less powerfully armed than their predecessors. Completed in 1904, Desaix was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron () before she was transferred to the Atlantic Division () the following year, where she served as a flagship. The cruiser returned to the Mediterranean in 1906, but only remained there for a year before rejoining the Atlantic Division. Desaix was in reserve from 1909 to 1914. As tensions rose shortly before the beginning of World War I in August 1914, the ship was reactivated. When the war began she was assigned to defend Allied shipping in the English Channel and intercept German ships attempting to pass through. Transferred back to the Mediterranean in early 1915, Desaix spent the next year patrolling off the coast of the Ottoman Levant and in the central Mediterranean. To help protect Allied shipping from German commerce raiders, the ship was transferred to French West Africa in mid-1916 and remained there for the rest of the war. She served in the Far Eastern Division () in 1919‚Äì1921 and was decommissioned shortly after her return. Desaix was sold for scrap in 1927.

The nickel steel armor belt of the Dupleix-class cruisers covered the entire waterline length of the ship except for of the stern. The belt armor was thick, although it reduced to in front of the forward turret. The curved protective deck had a total thickness of on the flat and on the upper part of the curved portion where it met the bottom edge of the belt armor.

The 3rd DL was on station in the western end of the Channel by 4 August, where they were tasked to intercept German shipping and provide distant cover to the smaller ships escorting the transports conveying the British Expeditionary Force to France.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 223‚Äì224 Improved defenses in the Channel and the stabilization of the front in early 1915 allowed the cruisers to be released from their tasks, so Desaix was assigned to the 3rd Squadron upon her arrival in the Eastern Mediterranean on 16 February. The squadron was tasked to patrol the area between Port Said, Egypt, and Alexandretta, Ottoman Syria. The cruiser was detached in May to assist the 1st Naval Army () in the Central Mediterranean with searching for German shipping near Italian ports; Desaix was tasked to watch Palermo, Sicily from 18 May. After 6 June, when the Italians agreed to take over that duty, the cruiser was assigned to reinforce the 2nd DL as it patrolled the area between Capo Colonna in southern Italy and the easternmost point of the Greek island of Crete. Later that month, she rejoined the 3rd Squadron and was tasked to help blockade the Ottoman coast from Latakia, Syria, to Mersin, together with the protected cruiser and the seaplane carrier .

To support his view that Warren was 'perfection', Hickey sought the opinion of Reynolds, \\"whom all the world allowed to be a competent judge\\" of beauty. Reynolds \\"declared every limb of hers perfect symmetry, and altogether he had never seen so faultless and finely formed a human figure.\\" =Death= Pott returned from India and the couple married. They sailed off to India to start a new life, much to the disapproval of Pott's father. Between Madras and Calcutta Warren died of a fever. Pott was so distraught that he had her coffin placed in a small boat that was towed behind the ship. On arrival in Calcutta her body was interred in the holy burial ground by the Hooghly River. Potts commissioned an architect, Mr Tiretta, to construct a mausoleum for her over the grave at a cost of ¬£3,000 and a column for an additional ¬£1,000.

She completed her undergraduate education in University of Alberta during 1938-1941 and graduated from the architectural program in University of Toronto in 1950. Grafton's early works during the same decade focused on schools, churches, and commercial building. These works were complete while she worked in several of Toronto architectural firms. In 1960 she started her own architectural practice, but had to eventually shutter it due to the lack of available funding to scale the business to acquire larger projects. Following her entrepreneurial venture, Grafton joined Public Works Canada in 1967 and in the following decade was responsible for designing residential schools for the Canadian government most notably for Attawapiskat and Kashechewan in Northern Ontario. As a design and project architect, her work can be found in many communities throughout Ontario. Grafton indicated that the work was quite challenging but interesting. She was pivotal in the overall design the Attawapiskat school and overcoming the technical challenges of constructing the building posed by the location's soil structure, weather and temperature. Activism During the 1980s and 1990s, Grafton actively participated in \\"For the Record\\", a project organized by the Ontario Women Graduates and funded by the Ontario Heritage Foundation, which sought to document women architects graduating from the University of Toronto architectural program between the 1920s and 1960s.

Gene deserts constitute an estimated 25% of the entire genome, leading to the recent interest in their true functions. Originally believed to contain inessential and ‚Äújunk‚Äù DNA due to their inability to create proteins, gene deserts have since been linked to several vital regulatory functions, including distal enhancing and conservatory inheritance. Thus, an increasing number of risks that lead to several major diseases, including a handful of cancers, have been attributed to irregularities found in gene deserts. One of the most notable examples is the 8q24 gene region, which, when affected by certain single nucleotide polymorphisms, lead to a myriad of diseases. The major identifying factors of gene deserts lay in their low GpC content and their relatively high levels of repeats, which are not observed in coding regions. Recent studies have even further categorized gene deserts into variable and stable forms; regions are categorized based on their behavior through recombination and their genetic contents. Although current knowledge of gene deserts is rather limited, ongoing research and improved techniques are beginning to open the doors for exploration on the various important effects of these noncoding regions. History Although the possibility of function in gene deserts was predicted as early as the 1960s, genetic identification tools were unable to uncover any specific characteristics of the long noncoding regions, other than that no coding occurred in those regions. Before the completion of the human genome in 2001 through the Human Genome Project, most of the early associative gene comparisons relied on the belief that essential housekeeping genes were clustered in the same areas of the genome for ease of access and tight regulation. This belief later constructed a hypothesis that gene deserts are therefore previous regulatory sequences that are highly linked (and hence do not undergo recombination), but have had substitutions between them over time. These substitutions could cause tightly conserved genes to separate over time, thus forming regions of nonsense codes with a few essential genes. However, uncertainty due to differential gene conservation rates in different portions of chromosomes prevented accurate identification. Later associations were remodeled when regulatory sequences were associated with transcription factors, leading to the birth of large-scale genome-wide mapping. Thus began the hunt for the contents and functions of gene deserts. Recent advancements in the screening of chromatin signatures on chromosomes (for instance, chromosome conformation capture, also known as 3C) have allowed the confirmation of the long-range gene activation model, which postulates that there are indeed physical links between regulatory enhancers and their target promoters. Research on gene deserts, although centralized on human genetics, has also been applied to mice, various birds, and Drosophila melanogaster. Although conservation is variable among selected species‚Äô genomes, orthologous gene deserts function similarly. Thus, the prevailing the contention of gene deserts is that these noncoding sequences harbor active and important regulatory elements. Possible functions One study focused on a regulatory archipelago, a region with ‚Äúislands‚Äù of coding sequences surrounded by vast noncoding regions. The study, which explored the effects of regulation on the hox genes, initially focused on two enhancer sequences, GCR and Prox, which are located 200 basepairs and 50 basepairs respectively upstream of the Hox D locus. To manipulate the region, the study inverted the two enhancer sequences and discovered no major effects on the transcription of the Hox D gene, even though the two sequences were the closest sequences to the gene. Thus, the turned to the gene desert that flanked the GCR sequence upstream and found 5 regulatory islands within it that could regulate the gene. To select the most likely candidate, the study then applied several individual and multiple deletions to the five islands to observe the effects. These varied deletions only resulted in minor effects including physical abnormalities or a few missing digits. When the experiment was taken a step further and applied a deletion of the entire 830 kilobase gene desert, the functionality of the entire Hox D locus was rendered inactive. This indicates that the neighboring gene desert, as an entire 830 kilobase unit (including the five island sequences within it), serves as an important regulator of a single gene that spans merely 50 kilobases. Therefore, these results hinted at the regulatory effects of flanking gene deserts. This study was supported by a later observation through a comparison between fluorescence in situ hybridization and chromosome conformation capture which discovered that the Hox D locus was the most decondensed portion in the region. This meant that it had relatively higher activity in comparison to the flanking gene deserts. Hence, the Hox D could be regulated by specific nearby enhancer sequences that were not expressed in unison. However, this does caution that proximity is inaccurate when either analytical method is used. Thus, associations between regulatory gene deserts and their target promoters seem to have variable distances and are not required to act as borders. Loop formation bring enhancer complexes close to their target promoters. This indicates that the gene ‚Äúislands‚Äù harbored by the gene deserts have essential regulatory functions. The variability in distance demonstrates that distance may be another important factor that is determined by gene deserts. For instance, distal enhancers may interact with their target promoters through looping interactions which must act over a certain distance. Thus, proximity is not an accurate predictor of enhancers: enhancers do not need to border their target sequence to regulate them. While this leads to a variation in distances, the average distance between transcription start sites and the interaction complex mediated by their enhancer elements is 120 kilobases upstream of the start site. Gene deserts may play a role in constructing this distance to allow maximal looping to occur. Given that the mechanism of enhancer complex formation is a fairly simply regulated mechanism (the structures that are recruited into the enhancing complex have various regulatory controls that control construction), more than 50% of promoters have several long-range interactions. Certain core genes even have up to 20 possible enhancing interactions. There is a curious bias for complexes to form only upstream of the promoters. Thus, given the correlation that many regulatory gene deserts appear upstream of their target promoters, it is possible that the more immediate role that gene deserts play is in long-range regulation of key sequences. As the ideal formation of enhancer interactions requires specific constructs, a possible side-product of the regulatory roles of gene deserts may be the conservation of genes: to retain the specific lengths of loops and order of regulating genes hidden in gene deserts, certain portions of gene deserts are more highly conserved than others when passing through inheritance events. These conserved noncoding sequences (CNS) are directly associated with syntenic inheritance in all vertebrates. Thus, the presence of these CNSs could serve to conserve of large regions of genes. Although distance may vary in regulatory gene deserts, distance appears to have an upper limit in conservative gene deserts. CNSs were initially thought to occur close to their conserved genes: earlier estimates placed most CNSs in proximity of gene sequences. However, the expansion of genetic data has revealed that several CNSs reside up to 2.5 megabases from their target genes, with the majority of CNSs falling between 1 and 2 megabases. This range, which was measured for the human genome, is varied among different species. For instance, in comparison to humans, the Fugu fish has a smaller range, with an estimated maximum distance of a few hundred kilobases. Regardless of the difference in lengths, CNSs work in similar methods in both species. Thus, as functions differ between gene deserts, so do their contents. Stable and variable gene deserts Stable gene deserts that house more essential genes are more readily conserved over time, passing this conservation to nearby genes. Variable gene deserts with fewer essential genes are thus subjected to frequent SNPs, most of which are neutral.Certain gene deserts are heavy regulators, while others may be deleted without any effect. As a possible classification, gene deserts can be broken down into two subtypes: stable and variable. Stable gene deserts have fewer repeats and have relatively higher Guanine to Cytosine (GpC) content than observed in variable gene deserts. Guanine and cytosine content is indicative of protein-coding functionality. For example, in a study on chromosomes 2 and 4, which have been linked to several genetic diseases, there were elevated GpC content in certain regions. Mutations in these GC-rich regions caused a variety of diseases, revealing the necessary integrity of these genes. High density CpG regions serve as regulatory regions for DNA methylation. Therefore, essential coding genes should be represented by high-CpG regions. In particular, regions with high GC content should tend to have high densities of genes that are devoted mainly to the essential housekeeping and tissue specific processes. These processes would require the most protein production to express functionality. Stable gene deserts, which have higher levels of GC content, should therefore contain the essential enhancer sequences. This could determine the conservatory functions of stable gene deserts. On the other hand, approximately 80% of gene deserts have low GpC contents, indicating that they have very few essential genes. Thus, the majority of gene deserts are variable gene deserts, which may have alternate functions. One prevalent theory regarding the origins of gene deserts postulates that gene deserts are accumulations of essential genes that act as a distance. This may hold true, as given the low numbers of essential genes within them, these regions would have been less conserved. As a result, due to the prevalence of cytosine to thymine conversions, the most common SNP, would cause a gradual separation between the few essential genes within variable gene deserts. These essential sequences would have been maintained and conserved, leading to small regions of high density that regulate at a distance. GC content is therefore indication for the presence of coding or regulatory processes in DNA. A comparison GC contents and recombination rates between stable and variable gene deserts separated by a coding gene. The general ratios displayed are independent of each other; the exact values do not reflect the scales. While stable gene deserts have higher GC content, this relative value is only an average. Within stable gene deserts, although the ends contain very high levels of GC content, the main bulk of the DNA contains even less GC content than observed in variable gene deserts. This indicates that there are very few highly conserved regions in stable gene deserts that do not recombine, or do so at very low rates. Given that the ends of the stable gene deserts have particularly high levels of GC contents, these sequences must be extremely conserved. This conservation may in turn cause the flanking genes to also have higher conservation rates. Thus, stable genes should be directly linked to at least one of their flanking genes and cannot be separated from coding sequences by recombination events. Most gene deserts appear to cluster in pairs around a small number of genes. This clustering creates long loci that have very low gene density; small regions with high numbers of genes are surrounded by long stretches of gene deserts, creating a low gene average. Therefore, the minimized probability of recombination events in these long loci creates syntenic blocks that are inherited together over time. These syntenic blocks can be conserved for very long periods of time, preventing loss of essential material, even while the distance between essential genes may grow in time. Although this effect should theoretically be amplified through the even lower GC-content in variable gene deserts (thereby truly minimalizing gene density), the gene conservation rates in variable gene deserts are even lower than observed in stable gene deserts‚Äîin fact, the rate is far lower than the rest of the genome. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that variable gene deserts may be recently evolved regions that have not yet been fixed into stable gene deserts. Therefore, shuffling may still occur before stabilizing regions within the variable gene deserts begin to cluster as whole units. There are a few exceptions to this minimal rate of conservation, as a few GC gene deserts are subjected to hypermethylation, which greatly reduces the accessibility to the DNA, thus effectively protecting the region from recombination. However, these occur rarely in observation. Although stable and variable gene deserts differ in content and function, both wield conservatory abilities. It is possible that since most variable gene deserts have regulatory elements that can act at a distance, conservation of the entire gene desert into a sytenic locus would not have been necessary, so long as these regulatory elements themselves were conserved as units. Given the particularly low levels of GC content, the regulatory elements would therefore be in a minimal gene density situation as observed similarly in flanking stable gene deserts, with the same effect. Thus, both types of gene deserts serve to retain essential genes within the genome. Genetic diseases The conservative nature of gene deserts confirms that these stretches of noncoding bases are essential to proper functioning. Indeed, a wide range of studies on irregularities in the noncoding genes discovered several associations to genetic diseases. One of the most studied gene deserts is the 8q24 region. Early genome wide association studies were focused on the 8q24 region (residing on chromosome 8) due to the abnormally high rates of SNPs that seem to occur in the region. These studies found that the region was linked to increased risks for a variety of cancers, notably in the prostate, breast, ovaries, colonic, and pancreas. Using inserts of the gene desert into bacterial artificial chromosomes, one study was able to produce enhancer activity in certain regions, which were isolated via cloning systems. This study successfully identified an enhancer sequence hidden in the region. Within this enhancer sequence, an SNP that conferred risk for prostate cancer, labeled SNP s6983267, was discovered in diseased mice. However, the 8q24 region is not solely limited to conferred risks of prostate cancer. A study in 2008 screened human subjects (and controls) with variations in the gene desert region, discovering five different regions that conferred different risks when affected by different SNPs. This study used identified SNP markers in the gene desert to identify risk conference from each of the regions to a specific tissue expression. Although these risks were successfully linked to various forms of cancer, Ghoussaini, M., et al. note their uncertainty in whether the SNPs functioned merely as markers or were the direct causants of the cancers. These varied effects occur due to the different interactions between the SNPs in this region and MYC promoters of different organs. The MYC promoter, which is located at a short distance downstream of the 8q24 region, is perhaps the most studied oncogene due to its association with a myriad of diseases. Normal functioning of the MYC promoter ensures that cells divide regularly. The study postulates that the 8q region, which underwent a chromosomal translocation in humans, could have moved an essential enhancer for the MYC promoter. This areas around this region could have been subjected to recombination that may have hidden the essential MYC enhancer within the gene desert through time, although its enhancing effects are still very much retained. This analysis stems from disease associations observed in several mice species where this region is retained at proximity to the MYC promoter. Thus, the 8q24 gene desert should have been somewhat linked to the MYC promoter. The desert resembles a stable gene desert that has had very little recombination after the translocation event. Thus, a potential hypothesis is that SNPs affecting this region disrupt the important tissue- specific genes with the stable gene desert, which could explain the risks of cancer in various tissue forms. This effect of hidden enhancer elements can also be observed in other locations in the genome. For instance, SNPs in the 5p13.1 deregulate the PTGER4 coding region, leading to Crohn's Disease. Another affected region in the 9p21 gene desert causes several coronary artery diseases. However, none of these risk-conferring gene deserts seem to be affected as much as the 8q24 regions. Current studies are still unsure about the SNP-affected processes in the 8q24 region that result in particularly amplified responses to the MYC promoter. With the aid of a more accessible population and more specific markers for genome wide association mapping, an increasing number of risk alleles are now being marked in gene deserts, where small, isolated, and seemingly-unimportant regions of genes may moderate important genes. A caveat It is crucial to note that although most of the gene deserts explored here are essential, it could be that the majority of the contents in gene deserts are still likely to be inessential and disposable. Naturally, this is not to say that the roles that gene deserts play are inessential or unimportant, rather than their functions may include buffering effects. An example of essential gene deserts with inessential DNA content are the telomeres that protect the ends of genomes. Telomeres can be categorized as true gene deserts, given that they solely contain repeats of TTAGGG (in humans) and do not have apparent protein-coding functions. Without these telomeres, human genomes would be severely mutated within a fixed number of cell cycles. On the other hand, since telomeres do not code for proteins, their loss ensures that there is no effect in important processes. Therefore, the term ‚Äújunk‚Äù DNA should no longer be applied to any region of the genome; every portion of the genome should play a role in protecting, regulating, or repairing the protein coding regions that determine the functions of life. Although there is still much to learn about the nooks and crannies of the immense (yet limited) human genome, with the aid of various new technologies and the synthesis of the full human genome, we may perhaps unravel a great collection of secrets in the approaching years about the marvels of our genetic code.

Alfred Frederickson (1909) Indian commercial development is defined by as the economic evolution of Native American tribes from hunter-gatherer based societies into fur-trade-based industries. From the early 1500s to the 1800s, intertribal and European relationships evolved in response to the growth of English settlements into the United States. The commercial relationship of each tribe was dependent upon its geographic resources and the cultural region it was a part in. Native American trade previous to European contact was limited to neighboring tribes as a method to define tribal and social boundaries.Hickerson 1973, p 18 The goods traded depended upon each tribes specialization, but each tribe was non dependent upon external trade for survival.Hickerson 1973, p 20 The development of trade between European traders and native tribes led to native tribes to specialize in fur trade in exchange for European goods. Economic contact between Native Americans and English settlers began in the 16th century and lasted until the 19th century. Early relationship between the English and local tribes were dependent upon the animal furs and pelts. Initial English settlement such as Jamestown and Plymouth depended on local tribes for a large portion of their livelihood.Vaughan 1965, p 24 As settlements became colonies, conflict steadily rose between both parties as English colonists occupied more lands and territories. With the notable population growth of English colonies, dependence upon tribal goods dissipated. Indian tribes of the North Eastern woodlands became increasingly dependent upon colonial goods. By the time of the foundation of the United States, the importance of tribal commerce was in decline. The steady expansion of the United States led to the disenfranchisement of Native Americans. Commercially, goods provided by Native Americans such as furs, had lost significance in the American economy. Political agendas were created that led to the steady expulsion of Native American tribes which confined them to reservations in the West. By the 1800s, Native American commercial power had all but diminished due to the subjugation of the United States government. Today, Native Americans satisfy commercial demand concerning gaming casinos and provided cultural goods.  Pre-English settlement  From the outset of the sixteenth century, Native American societies are characterized as hunter- gatherer societies and horticulturalist societies. This era is classified as the Pre-Columbian Era. The specialization of each tribe was dependent upon the geographic factors of their territory. (E.g. North eastern tribes such as the Iroquois engaged in seasonal migration to hunt for moose and shellfish,) Previous to any European contact, many tribes focused their economies on the exploitation of furs. The first trade between finished European goods for Indian furs began in 1641 with French Jesuit priests in Great Lake region. This initial contact lead to the development of the fur trade, specifically beaver pelts, which paved the way for French and later English colonization. Although European migration had a significant impact upon the economic development, it also impacted the social structure of tribes. The incoming migration led to the formation of federations and new tribes. = Native American pre-colonization commerce = Native American commerce was largely dependent upon the geography surrounding each of the tribes. These geographic areas came to find loose cultural boundaries which defined the economic structure of many tribes. General information for each region can be found here: *North Eastern Woodlands *Southeastern Woodlands *Great Plains * Great Basin * Northwest Plateau * Northwest Coast * California * Southwest The exact nature of the trade pre-European contact is not known, but general inferences may be drawn. Trade was extensive between tribal communities since luxury goods such as copper, shells, and stone moved great distances. Trade of useful commodities such as perishable goods was limited to local neighboring tribes. Trade between Native Americans was not directed towards profits. Trade had the function of providing communities with useful goods that they lacked, and served to reinforce social and territorial boundaries. Thus, goods processed as surplus in one community to another. An example of this is when the Huron's would trade surplus farm produce to the neighboring Algonkians. The earliest trade relations with incoming European trades consisted of the trade of furs and agricultural goods in return for metals and cloth goods focused in the North Eastern Woodlands and Great Lakes area.Hickerson 1972, p. 21 The development led to the increased specialization of each tribe as the trade in furs for goods became increasingly beneficial for tribes. Consequences of the fur trade led to the depletion of beavers and exploitation of resources in the area. The exploration of Native American fur and labor from European trading companies began extensively in the time period between 1600s-1700s.Hickerson 1972, p. 25 (pg 25) The development of the fur trade led to the establishment of firm social and political boundaries between tribes as well as the establishment of coalitions and confederacies between tribes. Popular confederations that came into existence in the 1630s are the Iroquois nation, the Pontiacs of 1760, and the coalition of Algonqian tribes which traded with the French in the great lakes region. These organizations developed purely as the product of the fur trade.Hickerson 1972, p. 27  Trade with English settlers  The Landing of the Pilgrims As English settlers came to the New World trade took upon the role of peacekeeping and necessity for the English settlers. In order to have a functional and healthy relationship with the Native Americans in the United States at that time, the English would trade certain goods; such as food, spices, weapons, tools, etc. to the Indians in return to access to fertile lands, use of waterways, and even rough maps depicting the layout of the land. When trade was happening with the early settlers the overall relationship between the English Colonists and Native Americans was very healthy. The Indians could have been savage and harmful to the English, but they understood the trade relationship as a way to better both parties and British colonization of the Americas was more successful because of this. Major challenges occurred due to occasional exploitation of Native American goods by settlers. This led to a steady deterioration of commercial trust between Native tribes and settlers. = Plymouth and Northern Settlers = Plymouth /Ààpl…™m…ôŒ∏/ (historically known as Plimouth and Plimoth) is a town in Plymouth County, Massachusetts, United States. Plymouth holds a place of great prominence in American history and is typically the most well known of the Northern Settlements. Plymouth was the site of the colony founded in 1620 by the Pilgrims, passengers of the famous ship the Mayflower. Before the arrival of the Mayflower earlier explorations killed between 90 and 95% of the local native inhabitants due to disease. The near disappearance of the tribe from the site not only left their cornfields and other cleared areas for the Pilgrims to take over, but also meant that the Indians were in no condition to disrupt the arrival of the colonists. With the dwindling numbers of Native Indians in the area they relied heavily on trade for subsistence and survival. They traded livestock for farming land and farming techniques. The overall relationship was good until the formation of Dominion of New England. Second Charter). Made by Willem Blaeu between 1609 and 1638. =Jamestown and Southern settlers= Jamestown and Southern settlers relied very much on the Indians for almost all their food which the Indians gave gladly for the exchange of precious metal. The area where Jamestown was settled, was that it was not inhabited by nearby Virginian Indian tribes, who regarded the site as too poor and remote for agriculture. The island was swampy, isolated, offered limited space and was plagued by mosquitoes and polluted tidal river water unsuitable for drinking. Due to this agricultural products, building materials, and minimal livestock was traded from Indians to Jamestown and other southern settlements in close proximity for precious metals, glassware, tools, and other instruments the Indians were unfamiliar with. As other southern settlers left Jamestown and furthered the exploration in the area they were often welcomed by the Indians with dancing, feasting and tobacco ceremonies. As relationships developed in the southern areas so did the need for healthy trade. The Indians realized that these explorers were not just passing through but looking to colonize and further expand their living areas. After several years of strained coexistence, Chief Opchanacanough and his Powhatan Confederacy attempted to eliminate the English colony once and for all. On the morning of March 22, 1622, they attacked outlying plantations and communities up and down the James River in what became known as the Indian Massacre of 1622. The attack killed over 300 settlers, about a third of the English-speaking population.  Trade with English Colonies  English colonies became permanent fixtures in the New America, trade became all the more important to keeping civility with the Indians. For most of the Colonies established in the Eastern States as Indians realized their colonies were here to stay, the Englishman were often met with much resistance and even war. Large colonies that were growing quicker everyday were threatening to destroy much of precious land held by the Indians. Also with the increased population came foreign disease which spread quickly among Indian colonies. Trade became tense and limited during these times of sickness and disease. In some Indian history the white man became a hated person. The more successful trade routes between English colonists and Native Americans in the United States were from explorers and mappers, they were seen as less of a threat and would often spend several days inside Indian Territory in order to survive the harshness of the land. = Northern colonies (New England) = An artist's rendition of Native Americans attacking a garrison house in King Philip's War Northern Colonies also known as The New England Colonies were made up of the colonies of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Providence Plantations, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. They were part of the Thirteen Colonies. They were mostly associated with the fur trade when there was trading and primary traded with the Pequot Indians, but most relationships were fractured due to disease and land disputes eventually leading to King Phillips War in 1675. This war was the single greatest war to occur in seventeenth century Puritan New England and is considered to be the deadliest war in the history of New England. King Philip's War began the development of a greater European American identity. Which fractured almost all economic activity between English colonists and the Indians in the Area. = Southern colonies = Indian trade in the southern colonies encompassed the regions of the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. The slave trade of Native Americans was common among southern colonies and Florida in the 1600s and early 1700s, but especially in the American Southeast. Most people associate Africans with the only people who were enslaved in the Americas however, in most of the southeastern colonies Native American slaves, at times, outnumbered those of African descent. Natives were sometimes used as labor on plantations or as servants. They were also used as interpreters for European traders. In many cases the colonists would trade with Native Americans; giving them goods and weapons, such as the musket, in exchange for beaver pelt and the capturing of other natives from rival tribes to be sold into slavery. This trade of slaves was not a very self-sustaining or an economic venture because either the native population was being wiped out and those who were not being killed or captured became the captors; and as the population of natives available for capture dwindled then the captors began to fall into debt with the colonists whom they were trading with. It was this debt and frustration that began the Yamasee War of 1715, which would ultimately be the demise of the trade system in the Carolina's. = The English traders = The English tradesman followed well established French trading routes throughout the Midwest Colonies traded for fur, tools such as buckets, axes, hammers, etc. They were usually welcomed by the Indians after these trade routes had been established, they often provided shelter, food, or even protection for other foreign Indian Tribes. As trading posts were established trade furthered with the tradesman and Indians. As traders pushed into new frontiers and unexplored areas of the New World, some resistance was met as they encountered new tribes.  Trade with the early United States  The years following the formation of the United States, the US government began to regulate the trade industry with the Indian Intercourse Act, which was passed on July 22, 1790. For the first time, The United States regulated trade with the Native Americans. The government established an agency called The Bureau of Indian Affairs which was responsible for issuing licences to trade in the Indian Territory. Because of the increasing movement west in the United States, more and more Native Americans were being pushed off of their native lands and deeper into the Western United States. Wars continued to break out such as Tecumseh's War that was a conflict between the United States Army and a Native American confederacy and that ultimately developed into the War of 1812. These wars with the native population damaged relations between the Indians and the United States. During this time period large and small fur companies began to spring up across America. The American Fur Company, which was established in 1808, was one of the largest trading companies in the United States. As the 1800s continued on fur became less popular as the fashion trends began to shift. The Native American economy relied heavily on goods received from the fur trade and when it slowed they had to turn to other sources to continue receiving goods that they needed. The Native Americans began to sell off their land to settlers in oftentimes forced situations. These tense deals lead to future armed conflicts. = Trade with Southern Indians = Map showing the displacement of Native Americans Most of the Native American tribes of the south were forcefully relocated during the Indian Removal in the 1830s. These tribes were relocated to Indian Territory which was west of the Mississippi River. The Muscogee also known as the Creek were a Native American people located in the southeastern woodlands. This area consisted mostly of Oklahoma, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. The Muscogee participated heavily in the deer skin trade. Their main hunting grounds were in Savannah and Florida. The Muscogee that were located more towards the south began to migrate into Florida and then later became known as the Seminoles. At the beginning of the 19th century conflicts between the Seminoles and white settlers became more frequent. By the end of the 19th century more than 3,000 Seminoles had been relocated and only an estimated 200 to 300 remained in Florida. Consequently, trade in the southern states came to a halt at the end of this era. =Trade with the West= In the early 1800s trade with Native Americans was already commonplace. Trade with the Native Americans in the mid- west states mostly consisted of beaver fur, and in return natives would receive horses, guns, and other commodities that they themselves could not produce. During the Indian Removal in this time, many tribes were pushed by the government into western states such as Kansas, Kentucky, and Missouri. The Shawnee was one such tribe that was pushed from Pennsylvania and into Ohio, Alabama, and Illinois. The Shawnee traded fur in exchange for rum or brandy. Alcohol abuse became a serious problem within the tribe. Another tribe that heavily populated the southern plains region was the Comanche tribe Annual rendezvous of Rocky Mountain trappers. Original sketch in Oregon Trail Museum. Another tribe that heavily populated the southern plains region was the Comanche tribe. The Comanche were mostly farmers before the tribal conflicts over the fur trade that began due to the Europeans. After the fur wars, the Comanches were driven from eastern territories and into the bison hunting territory. By the nineteenth century, the Comanche tribe were mostly nomadic and relying heavily on the hunting of bison to sustain life. Bison fur was also traded with other tribes and with villagers located in the Missouri. Three other tribes that also participated in the bison trade with the Comanche were the Cheyenne, Kiowa and Arapahoes tribes. The four tribes constantly searched for prime buffalo grounds and horse herds that they could trade with the Missouri villagers and the horse reservoir that was located in the south. One common source of trading that occurred in the west was through the Rocky Mountain Rendezvous. The Rendezvous was an annual gathering that took places over a variety of locations. Large fur companies such as the American Fur Company would put together mule trains that were loaded with commodities such as whiskey, ammunition, and other supplies that were necessary for life in the West.Native Americans were not the only ones to attend these rendezvouses, mountain men and trappers would also attend to trade their furs and hides. The Rendezvous was an opportunity for all traders to replenish supply. The rendezvous was an opportunity for trappers and traders to come together and share ideas and to socialize. Natives usually brought their entire families and were viewed as peculiar to the other attendees. Trade with the United States 1820-1870 Conflict with the Native Americans steadily increased during this time period. The Manifest Destiny attitude of the United States government was reflected in their dealings with tribal nations. During this era, the Indian Removal Act of 1830 was passed, leading to the genocide of many eastern Indian tribes. The final treaty with Native Americans which was known as The End of Treating Making 1871 marked the end of government recognition of Indian tribes and introduced the creation of Indian reservations that continue to the modern day. This absolute disenfranchisement of Native Americans marked the end of any official trading with the United States. = Eastern United States = The 1830 Indian Removal Act, signed into law by President Andrew Jackson, authorized the President to grant unsettled lands west of the Mississippi River in exchange for Indian lands within existing state borders. Due to the Indian Removal Act of 1830, and the Second Seminole War, official trade of commercial goods on the East Coast concluded. By 1839 the Cherokee nation was forced to give up its land and migrate to present day Oklahoma. The Cherokee people called this the Trail of Tears due to its devastating affects which left 4,000 out of the 15,000 Cherokees dead. = Mid-West = In 1828 Fort Union, located in Upper Missouri was the chief establishment for most fur companies, lone traders like, Wyeth, Bonneville, Pilcher, Fontenelle made it competitive for established fur companies. In 1834 Fur trade was at its height, with half dozen organized companies in the United States competing with the American fur company which during this time had monopolize the fur trade industry in the United States by 1830. Fur companies competing with the American fur company were forced or found it useful to their advantage to utilize the wandering habits of the Indians, having only general rendezvous, most hunters were sent out in different directions. Not having storehouses, hunters would bury their furs until the annual caravan sent out to St. Louis. = Utah = The Ute nation and Paiutes experienced continuous conflict with the Mormon settlers who's lineage could be tracked to the English settlers. Although certain accommodations were arranged with the Mormon settlers, the occupation and abuse of resources and wildlife ultimately exhausted peaceful relationships between the Native Americans and Mormon settlers. The Mormons attempted to suppress the New Mexican trade; which resulted in the disruption of the Ute economy and society. On July 17, 1853 a catastrophic dispute between James Ivie and a couple of Ute members led to a disagreement, which eventually resulted in one of the Ute members being killed. This dispute and many more issues led to the Walker War. = California = The California gold rush was the start of genocide of Native Americans on the west coast. Miners, loggers and settlers formed vigilant groups to hunt Indians who were living outside the mission communities. In the year 1845, the population of Native Americans was estimated to be around 150,000 which decreased significantly to 30,000 by 1870. This massive decrease in the population was a result of life-threatening and contagious diseases, dwindling of wildlife and resources and constant persecution from the influx of new arrivals which included the English migrants and Europeans. United States legislation on commerce with Native Americans = Articles of Confederation = Under the Articles of Confederation, there was neither effectiveness nor efficiency when concerning the central government. Under the Articles, Congress didn't have political credibility to pass or enact legislation. For example, Congress didn't have the power to tax, only suggest or request money.http://www.historycentral.com/NN/economic/articleofconfed.html This led to the consequence of insufficient funds to finance soldiers, bond holders, or regulate a currency. This affected Native Americans in the aspect that they had to go through various obstacles to trade or sell commodities. In addition, without a regulating currency, this could inflate prices on their goods and services. Also, different specie would make transactions more difficult. However, the Articles of Confederation granted regulated trade between the federal government and Native American tribes.http://ushistoryscene.com/article/articles-of-confederation/ The Articles of Confederation lack of acknowledging interstate commerce resulted in unnecessary taxes and tariffs between states.https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/timeline/newnatn/nativeam/ This affected Native American commerce because they still had to pay taxes, but on a state-by-state basis, which potentially led to a discriminatory tax. Depending on the geographical region, some tribes had disputes and wars with colonists, which led to tense relations. = United States Constitution = Under the Articles of Confederation, there were no laws or regulations that gave Congress the power to regulate commerce. Thus, the states were in charge or monitoring their own commerce between other states. This proved to be difficult for Native American trading, for there was no unity between the states; each state was its own nation with their own set of rules and regulations, which added even more complications to how Indians were able to operate commerce transactions. However, the Confederation Congress spent a good deal of time and effort developing policies to keep peace between the white settlers and the Native Americans. To maintain peace between early colonies and Native Americans, the Confederation Congress were able to raise armies, as well as appoint liaisons to settle insurrections that would occur. Under the new Constitution, framers added the Commerce Clause: (Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3):https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html ‚ÄúTo regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;‚Äù The idea or intention of the framers were to regulate commerce between four forms of sovereignty: Native American tribes, foreign countries, states, and the federal government of the United States. The effects of Constitution ratifications gave more central authority to the federal government over Native Americans tribes through the Trade and Intercourse Acts, as well as Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 (Treaty Clause), and Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2 (Property Clause): The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State. Within the first decade of the ratification of the Constitution, Congress passed The Northwest Ordinance (1785) in the hope of raising federal revenue from the sale of Western land. Under this ordinance, there were demarcation lines of counties and townships up to the discretion of the governor: Section 8.http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc;=8&page;=transcript For the prevention of crimes and injuries, the laws to be adopted or made shall have force in all parts of the district, and for the execution of process, criminal and civil, the governor shall make proper divisions thereof; and he shall proceed from time to time as circumstances may require, to lay out the parts of the district in which the Indian titles shall have been extinguished, into counties and townships, subject, however, to such alterations as may thereafter be made by the legislature. Section 14, Article III illustrates the ideal relationship between Native Americans and government: Religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged. The utmost good faith shall always be observed towards the Indians; their lands and property shall never be taken from them without their consent; and, in their property, rights, and liberty, they shall never be invaded or disturbed, unless in just and lawful wars authorized by Congress; but laws founded in justice and humanity, shall from time to time be made for preventing wrongs being done to them, and for preserving peace and friendship with them. = Federal involvement = Johnson v. M'IntoshJohnson v. M'Intosh proved that the new central government was in favor of sovereign property rights, by stating that private citizens could not purchase Native American land, and that the federal government has the sole righthttps://www.oyez.org/cases/1789-1850/21us543 to negotiate with tribal nations. Cherokee Nation v. GeorgiaCherokee Nation v. Georgia was a case that stripped away of rights from Cherokee Nation due to the court arguing that the tribe had no original jurisdictionhttp://kids.laws.com/cherokee-nation-v- georgia because they were a sovereign tribe. Supporters uphold this verdict under Article III of the Constitution. Worcester v. GeorgiaWorcester v. Georgia argued the fundamentals of state government and established boundaries that ensured peace and privacy with the Cherokee Nation. In a 5-1 decision, the court argued in favor of Worcester that the state of Georgia does not have the authority to regulate the intercoursehttps://www.oyez.org/cases/1789-1850/31us515 between citizens of its state and members of the Cherokee Nation. In 1830, President Andrew Jackson enacted The Indian Removal Acthttp://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/nattrans/ntecoindian/essays/indianremoval.htm, in which Native Americans east of the Mississippi were forced to move west of the Mississippi River. The logistics behind it were due to high demand of American settlers wanting to live there. Notes References * Becker, R. J. (2013).

The temple was built in Sogamoso, Colombia, then part of the Muisca Confederation and called Sugamuxi. It was the most important temple in the religion of the Muisca. The temple was destroyed by fire brought by the Spanish conquistadores led by Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada who was eager to find the legendary El Dorado.Ocampo L√≥pez, 2013, Ch.1, p.18 A reconstruction has been built in the Archeology Museum of Sogamoso.  Structure and worship  Coat of arms of Sogamoso; City of the Sun Soldiers in the army of Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada destroyed the temple with their torches The Temple of the Sun was built on the right banks of the small river Monquir√°. The temple was a large round structure made of poles and clay with a roof made of reed. The temple did not have any windows. The columns surrounding the temple were built in three concentric rings made of wood harvested in Casanare. The temple represented the cosmos and was built to honour Sun god Su√©. The temple also was a burial ground for the most important caciques and priests (Chibcha: ogques). Temple of the Sun - Sogamoso - Pueblos Originarios - accessed 04-05-2016 The Muisca had a decent knowledge of astronomy and constructed various sites across their territories. El Infiernito, just outside Villa de Leyva has survived. The Sun Temple was constructed according to the positions of the Sun. At the temple rituals were organised by the caciques and zaques of the Muisca Confederation. The mythological Idacans√°s held gatherings where children (moxas) were sacrificed.

He arrived in the afternoon and decided to wait till next morning to take the cacique of Sugamuxi out of the temple. Curious to see the treasures in the temple, two of his soldiers, Miguel S√°nchez and Juan Rodr√≠guez Parra went to the sacred place on the night of September 4th, lighting their way with torches. When they entered the temple they found rich ornaments and mummies of ancient nobles. While they were collecting parts of the treasures of the temple they accidentally set fire to it with their torches destroying the temple. = Reconstruction = In 1942 archeologist Eli√©cer Silva Celis uncovered a Muisca cemetery in Sogamoso. The cemetery contained tombs of indigenous Muisca with mummies still preserved. Based on his archeological findings he was able to locate the original site of the temple and decided to reconstruct it. The replica of the temple is high. The symbols in the dome tell the story of the creation of the Earth by Chiminigagua, the Supreme Being of the Muisca. The small openings on the sides serve as a calendar; every year on December 22nd the sunlight falls right on the central pillar. Around the temple the cemetery with mummies, that were originally displayed inside the temple, is reconstructed.

It also contributes to other projects of the Order of St John around the world, responds to special appeals for disaster relief, and maintains a volunteer service corps that serves veterans in the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. History The predecessor of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem have had a long history in the United States of America. In the 1870s, Bishop Charles Todd Quintard of Tennessee had been made a Chaplain of what was then called the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem in England. The number of members of the Order in the United States remained small even after the a Royal Charter was granted by HM Queen Victoria in 1888. It was only in the 1950s that a number of prominent individuals in the area of New York City began to get involved with the Order's work. Before 1960, the membership included Fanny Hanna Moore, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, Edward Nason West, and Grayson L. Kirk. As more people became involved in the Order, a need was felt for some sort of organization to help in the coordination of fundraising and service efforts. Because the United States of America was a republic with no formal connection to the United Kingdom or the Commonwealth, an alternative to the traditional Priories and Commanderies was devised. In 1957, the American Society of the Order was formally incorporated in the state of New York with Fairbanks and others acting as the original founders. This allowed the American contingent of Order members to more effectively raise funds for the Eye Hospital in Jerusalem and the Order's work around the world. As the Order's presence in the United States grew, it was able to expand beyond its traditional base in the area around New York City. Groups of members began to develop around St. Louis, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. among other areas. The geographic area of the Order in the United States became larger and the membership became more diverse. By the early 1990s, the arrangement whereby the Order was represented in the United States solely by a corporate entity in New York became untenable. On May 11, 1996, the Priory in the USA was formally established at a ceremony National Cathedral in Washington attended by HRH Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester. When the Priory was established, some members of the Order from existing Priories expressed concern that those appointed in the new Priory would be buying honors since there was no St. John Ambulance in which service could be recognized. Since its establishment, the Priory in the USA has \\"raised millions of dollars over the years to support the work of St John of Jerusalem Eye Hospital, its hospital in Hebron, satellite eye clinics in Gaza and the West Bank, and mobile outreach, training, teaching and research programs.\\" Structure =National organization= Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. was invested as an associate knight of the Order of St John in 1950. He is shown here attending a service of rededication at the Priory Church at Clerkenwell in 1958. As one of eleven Priories of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, the Priory in the United States of America is led by a Prior and a Chapter. The Priory has had three Priors since it was established in 1996: * John R. Drexel IV, GCStJ (1996‚Äì2008) * A. Marshall Acuff, GCStJ (2008‚Äì2014) * Palmer C. Hamilton, KStJ (2014‚Äìpresent) From the foundation of the Priory until 2012, the American Society and the Priory in the USA worked concurrently to fulfill the Order's mission in the country. The American Society was dissolved on June 26, 2012 and its functions were absorbed into the Priory. The Chapter of the Priory comprises 20 members of the Order from across the United States who serve staggered three-year terms. There are also several national officers of the Priory including the chancellor, four vice- chancellors, a sub-prelate, a treasurer, a secretary, a hospitaller, an historiographer, and a genealogist. These are appointed to three-year terms as well. The Priory also employs an executive director who is not a member of the Order, but \\"handles day-to-day operations, focusing on membership communications and fundraising within and outside the Order.\\" =Regional organization= The regional administration of the Priory is divided up into thirteen geographic areas. As of 2014, these regions were Atlanta, Charleston, Connecticut, the Gulf Coast, the Mountain States, New York, Palm Beach, Richmond, San Diego, San Francisco, Southwest, St. Louis, and Washington, DC. Each region is headed by a regional chair and a committee that plans and organizes fund-raising events. The annual service of investiture and rededication also rotates through these cities each year. Service Unlike many other Priories and Associations of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, the Priory in the United States of America does not manage an ambulance service for first aid training and first aid cover. The main mission of the Priory has always been to raise funds for the Order's eye hospital in Jerusalem. This was its main purpose in its days as the American Society, as well. The donations provided by the Priory in the United States comprise a large portion of the Eye Hospital's budget. In 2014‚Äîthe most recent year for which data are available‚Äîthe Priory donated $1,515,562 to the hospital's work. Since 2013, the Priory in the United States has overseen the St. John Volunteer Corps (SJVC). It was formally launched at the Priory's annual meeting in January of that year. Because the Priory has never been involved with the St. John Ambulance, confr√®res in the United States had never had coordinated hands-on service opportunities in which to be involved. They were not able to support the work of the Order beyond making annual oblations to Eye Hospital. The SJVC's stated goal is to give \\"provide members and potential members [of the Priory] with the opportunity to engage in a variety of volunteer service activities in Veterans Administration Facilities throughout the United States.\\" Cooperation with the Order of St John Former Lord Prior of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem Anthony Mellows frequently attended the Priory in the USA's annual investiture service. He is shown here at the service in October 2015 in Dallas, Texas. In addition to working with the Saint John Eye Hospital Group and the St. John Volunteer Corps, the Priory in the United States of America is involved in other cooperative work both with the other establishments of the Order of St. John and with other organizations. As one of 11 international Priories of the Order of St John, the Priory in the United States has twice been the host of the annual Grand Council meeting of the international Order of St John. It also has supported various appeals from the international office in London. These have included the Grand Prior's appeal for the Priory of South Africa for its home-based care training programs, St. John programs in Sri Lanka and in Canada, and renovation projects for the Order's Priory Church crypt and museum in Clerkenwell, London. On a personal level, members of the Priory in the United States respond to the disasters such as tsunamis in Asia, Hurricane Katrina in the United States, and a cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe by providing medical equipment, supplies and financial support to relief efforts.

United States, 342 U.S. 143 (1951), is a decision of the United States Supreme Court. often cited as an example of a monopolization violation being based on unilateral denial of access to an essential facility, although it in fact involved concerted action.See. e.g., Robert Pitofsky, Donna Patterson, and Jonathan Hooks, The Essential Facilities Doctrine Under United States Antitrust Law, 70 L.J. 443, 446‚Äì47 (2002) (characterizing it as \\"a unilateral refusal to deal\\" case). Actually, Lorain Journal involved agreements with reluctantly acquiescent customers that they would not deal with a competitive radio station, as explained in the Background section. When the Lorain Journal's monopoly over advertising in the Lorain, Ohio area was threatened by the establishment of a competing radio station, the Journal's publisher refused to accept advertising from those who advertised over the radio station and required them to advertise only in the Journal. The purpose of the publisher was to eliminate the competition of the radio station. The Supreme Court held that the publisher had attempted to monopolize trade and commerce, in violation of ¬ß 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and was properly enjoined from continuing the conduct. Background The defendant The Lorain Journal Company published a newspaper here called the Journal. For some years, the Journal maintained \\"a commanding and an overpowering\\" position in the area. It reached 99% of the families in the city. It was the only daily newspaper. It carried a substantial amount of local and national advertising.342 U.S. at 146. Until 1948, the Journal enjoyed a monopoly \\"of the mass dissemination of news and advertising, both of a local and national character.\\" In 1948, however, the FCC licensed the Elyria-Lorain Broadcasting Co. to operate a radio station, WEOL, in the Elyria, Oberlin, and Lorain, Ohio area. Many of the local advertisers in the Journal wanted to use WEOL as well. The Journal developed a plan to eliminate the competition from WEOL. The Journal refused to accept local advertisements in the Journal from any Lorain County advertiser who advertised or who appeared to be about to advertise over WEOL.342 U.S. at 147‚Äì48. The Journal monitored WEOL programs to determine the identity of the station's local Lorain advertisers. Those using the station had their contracts with the Journal terminated, and were able to renew them only after ceasing to advertise through WEOL. As a result, many Lorain County merchants either ceased advertising or abandoned their plans to advertise over WEOL. The district court found that \\"the very existence of WEOL is imperiled by this attack upon one of its principal sources of business and income.\\"342 U.S. at 149. The district court therefore found a violation of ¬ß 2 of the Sherman Act and enjoined the Journal from continuing its program of refusing to deal with advertisers who advertised in WEOL and of requiring advertisers to advertise only in the Journal. The publisher appealed to the Supreme Court. Ruling of Supreme Court Justice Harold Burton delivered the opinion of the Court Justice Harold H. Burton delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court that the Journal's publisher attempted to monopolize in violation of ¬ß 2 of the Sherman Act and was properly enjoined from continuing to do so. The Court found the most important among the facts supporting the district court's judgment to be that the Journal enjoyed a nearly complete monopoly in Lorain from 1933 to 1948, together with a 99% coverage of all Lorain families. \\"Those factors made the Journal an indispensable medium of advertising for many Lorain concerns.\\" Accordingly, the Journal's: > refusals to print Lorain advertising for those using WEOL for like > advertising often amounted to an effective prohibition of the use of WEOL > for that purpose. Numerous Lorain advertisers wished to supplement their > local newspaper advertising with local radio advertising, but could not > afford to discontinue their newspaper advertising in order to use the > radio.342 U.S. at 152‚Äì53. The Court said it was clear that \\"if all the newspapers in a city, in order to monopolize the dissemination of news and advertising by eliminating a competing radio station, conspired to accept no advertisements from anyone who advertised over that station,\\" their boycott conspiracy would violate ¬ß¬ß 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, since that was held in such cases as Fashion Originators' Guild v. FTC. The Court continued, \\"It is consistent with that result to hold here that a single newspaper, already enjoying a substantial monopoly in its area, violates the 'attempt to monopolize' clause of ¬ß 2 when it uses its monopoly to destroy threatened competition.\\"342 U.S. at 154. The Journal sought to excuse its conduct on the ground that it has a \\"right as a private business concern to select its customers and to refuse to accept advertisement from whomever it pleases.\\" The Court said that such a right is not unqualified: > The right claimed by the publisher is neither absolute nor exempt from > regulation. Its exercise a purposeful means of monopolizing interstate > commerce is prohibited by the Sherman Act. The operator of the radio > station, equally with the publisher of the newspaper, is entitled to the > protection of that Act.342 U.S. at 155. Commentary ‚óè A Note in the Virginia Law Review focused on the fact that the Court found an attempted monopolization of interstate commerce even though the Journal attempted to monopolize the advertising of local merchants only and did not refuse or try to monopolize the business of national advertisers because of their dealings with the radio station: > In this sense the monopoly was confined to the limits of a single city. This > was nevertheless a forbidden monopoly, as the successful destruction of > competition in local business by forcing the station to close would also > have destroyed competition in interstate business, i.e., the national > advertising carried by both the newspaper and the radio station. Thus the > case is useful to point out again that the suppression of local competition > is not free from the threat of prosecution under the Sherman Act simply > because an intrastate and not an interstate monopoly is contemplated.Note. > 38 404, 406 (1952). ‚óè Charles Barber points to a contradiction or disconnect in the case law regarding specific intent in cases of this type. In Lorain Journal, especially as interpreted in Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States,. the specific intent behind the refusal to deal‚Äîa purpose to eliminate a competitor‚Äîor a purpose to create or maintain a monopoly‚Äîwas a major theme in finding a ¬ß 2 Sherman Act violation.See Charles F. Barber, Refusals To Deal Under the Federal Antitrust Laws, 103 U. 847, 862, 866 (1955). In Lorain Journal, the district court had found that the purpose and intent of the Journal's refusals to sell \\"was to destroy the broadcasting company.\\" In Times-Picayune, the Court held that monopolization did not occur because there was no showing of specific intent to destroy competition or build monopoly, and the newspaper's challenged practice was legal; because it was predominantly motivated \\"by legitimate business aims.\\"345 U.S. at 622. The Court distinguished the Lorain Journal case on the ground that there the newspaper's refusal to sell space to advertisers who advertised on the local radio station manifested \\"bold, relentless, and predatory commercial behavior,\\"See 342 U.S. at 149. which was absent in the Times-Picayune case. Barber maintains that the Court's \\"emphasis on specific intent suggests that it regarded this as controlling\\" on the monopolization issue.Barber, at 866. Yet, Barber insists, United States v. Griffith,. which is quoted in both Lorain Journal and Times-Picayune, \\"held that specific intent is no longer an element of the offense of monopolization under Section 2.\\" Barber, at 870. Barber therefore concludes: > The cases reviewed above indicate that the courts are groping for an > appropriate rationale of the monopoly provisions of the Sherman Act which, > while limiting the freedom of a trader unduly to exploit trade advantages > stemming from his market position, will assure the preservation of his > essential freedom to develop his business, including his supplier and > customer relationships, in accordance with his personal business > judgment.Barber, at 872. ‚óè Donald Turner observed in the Harvard Law Review that the Supreme Court was \\"unquestionably correct\\" in holding the Journal's conduct an unlawful attempt to monopolize under section 2 of the Sherman Ac. Nonetheless, if the Court had been asked to do so, it could properly \\"also have held that each seller [merchant contracting for advertisements] who complied with Lorain Journal's demands became party to an agreement with Lorain Journal to boycott the radio station.\\" The only problem with holding that would be \\"the seeming unfairness of subjecting the coerced sellers to criminal penalties.\\" It would be a mistake, however, Turner argued, to hold (as in Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States. or United States v. Parke, Davis & Co..) \\"that the sellers, each being aware that others would also cease patronizing the radio station, have agreed with each other to carry on a collective boycott [emphasis added].\\" The reason is that: > [T]he decision of each seller was apparently wholly independent of the > decisions of the others; each decision simply reflected an economic choice, > forced by the newspaper's policy, as to which advertising medium could be > dispensed with at least cost, a choice wholly unaffected by what other > sellers might choose to do.Donald F. Turner, The Definition of Agreement > under the Sherman Act: Conscious Parallelism and Refusals to Deal, 75 655, > 700 (Feb. 1962). In Interstate Circuit, for example, \\"there was ample evidence . . . to support a finding of horizontal agreement of the most obvious sort, including the significant evidence that the consequence of imposing limitations on the movie chains' subsequent-run competitors had been to increase not only the profits of the chains but also the profits of each distributor.\\"Id. In the Lorain Journal case, each acquiescent merchant \\"ended up worse off than before.\\" Such an agreement \\"would be an odd sort of agreement.\\" In such a case it would be more sensible to proceed against the instigating party [who] has coerced those with whom he dealt\\" under a theory of attempted monopolization, as the Court did in the Lorain Journal case.Id. at 701. Finally, Turner emphasizes: > In Lorain Journal, for example, the principal culprit was clearly the > newspaper which instigated the boycott of the radio station. The advertisers > who dealt with the paper, and who acquiesced in its demands, were unwilling > participants. Moreover, the situation can be remedied, as indeed it was in > Lorain Journal, by [the government's] proceeding against the instigator > alone; freed of the unlawful pressures, the other parties would presumably > revert to the nonrestrictive decisions they made before.

Multiple studies have found a correlation between the location of segmental duplications and regions of chromosomal instability. This correlation suggests that they may be mediators of some genomic disorders. Segmental duplications are shown to be flanked on both sides by large homologous repeats, which exposes the region to recurrent rearrangement by nonallelic homologous recombination, leading to either deletion, duplication, or inversion of the original sequence.  Background  = Finding segmental duplications = Cataloging of segmental duplications was originally difficult due to its inconspicuousness, large size, and high degree of sequence similarity. This led to issues of interpreting separate loci as one sequence as these duplications are over-represented in unordered and unassigned contigs. Furthermore, these duplications are more prevalent within the pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions. BACs containing intrachromosomal duplications can be made and their duplication pattern can be characterized using FISH. Comparison can be made between chromosomes that were positive by FISH and the chromosomal position using BLAST. Scientist have attempted to map the location of these segmental duplications, but they run into issues of accurate sequencing within these duplication regions. Because of this, scientists share the sentiment that accurate human genome assembly is difficult due to these segmental duplications. = Genomic instability = Regions of the genome which are flanked by repeats represent potential hotspots of genomic instability that are prone to copy-number variation. It has been shown that the larger and more homologous duplicated sequences lead to more sporadic segmental aneusomy events. The human genome contains around 130 regions, totaling 274Mb and ten percent of the total genome, that are flanked by these intrachromosomal duplications. Scientists have currently identified twenty-five of these regions to be directly associated with some form of genetic disorder. Further research identified fifty-one regions displaying genomic instability in the form of copy-number polymorphisms. It was also observed that these CNPs are prevalent across different ethnic groups as well. This allows for two important claims to be made. Firstly, it is possible that the structural rearrangements are evolutionarily ancient and occurred prior to separation of ethnic groups. Secondly, it may also be possible that they have independently occurred within each ethnic group. Research has also found an increase of segmental duplications within regions of the CNPs showing that the duplications are responsible for the variation in copy number. Hypotheses have been made suggesting that many CNPs are only prevalent within the human genome because of the absence or presence of the evolutionarily recent segmental duplication events that have not quite become fixed within the human population. This shows that segmental duplications are responsible for defining locations of chromosomal rearrangement within the human genome. Segmental duplications are also often themselves variant in copy number.  Primate segmental duplications  Most human segmental duplications are less than 300 kb in length, whereas research has begun to show that other primates, such as the chimpanzee, contain more duplications. There is a difference in copy number and content for about a third of the duplications with at least 94% shared identity. However, when the levels of segmental duplication in primates are compared with other mammals, we see that primates on average contain more than the rest of the mammalian world. Segmental duplications have been hypothesized to be evolutionarily significant. From this, it has been observed that new-lineage segmental duplications map near shared ancestral duplications when comparing the human and chimpanzee. This is phenomenon known as duplication shadowing and it suggests that unique regions flanking duplications are about ten times as likely to become duplicated as other randomly duplicated regions. One distinguishing factor of primate genomes from other mammalian genomes is the abundance of interchromosomal and interspersed interchromosomal duplications. 48% of human duplications can be termed as interchromosomal, versus 13% in mice. Segmental duplications found in primate genomes fall under one of three classifications. These are the pericentromeric, subtelomeric, and interstitial regions. Segmental duplications in pericentromeric regions are unique in that around 30% of their sequence can be traced to duplications occurring from other chromosomes. The number of segmental duplications in pericentromeric regions is highly variable, having as few as zero. Twenty-nine of the forty-three pericentromeric regions have some form of segmental duplication totaling 47.6Mb, which is almost a third of all segmental duplications found in the human genome. Segmental duplication in subtelomeric regions are similar to those pericentromeric in that they are enriched in interchromosomal segmental duplications. Thirty of the forty-two subtelomeric regions contain segmental duplications. However, these total only 2.6Mb. It is not known whether the duplications of the subtelomeric regions arise from other chromosomes as with the pericentromeric regions. Interstitial region segmental duplications are distributed on the euchromatin between the pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions. They account for the most of the interchromosomal duplications. Interstitial duplications make up most of the largest and highest-identity human segmental duplications as compared to interchromosomal duplications. Following formation of segmental duplications, forces of evolution such as base-pair substitutions, insertions, deletions, and retrotransposition are all possible. It has been suggested that segmental duplications undergo homology- driven mutations. There are two main homology-driven processes that lead to structural alterations. Homology between segmental duplications can initiate NAHR, which occurs from the alignment of highly similar segmental duplications that are followed by paralogous recombination, or through the non-reciprocal transfer of sequence from one segmental duplication copy to another. This is referred to as gene conversion, which can be detected using newly-created computational algorithms. = Role in evolution = Segmental duplications are also important for their role in the evolution of new genes as it is one of the primary mechanisms by which new genes are created. The most common method by which segmental duplication operates in creating new genes is by duplication of the entire gene, whether it is in tandem or in an interspersed configuration. Using whole-genome shotgun sequencing, it has been found that gene density is the greatest factor in showing correlation with segmental duplication density. However, this does not mean that all segmental duplications are enriched for genes and that all duplication regions are sites for the formation of new genes. Rather, it has been seen that segmental duplications which contain interstitial interchromosomal duplications are regions with the most enrichment of genes. Comparing the subtelomeric and pericentromeric regions, it is seen that the subtelomeric regions contains more gene content and transcriptional activity. Genes found within segmental duplications also share properties. Firstly, strong signatures of positive selection are common in segmentally duplicated genes. Secondly, these genes are five to ten times more likely than their counterparts to show interspecies and intraspecies structural and copy-number variation. Finally, immune response and xenobiotic recognition are some functions that are enriched within these genes. Together, this suggests an important role for segmental duplication within human and primate adaptive evolution. This has a great effect in humans as polymorphic insertions, inversions, and deletions are found with greater frequency near sites of segmental duplications. Similarly observed in chimpanzees, this suggests that duplicated regions are continuing to rearrange and evolve in contemporary primate populations. Recent research also suggests that segmental duplications and structural variation also have protective and beneficial effects. A 900kb inversion polymorphism, which is mediated by segmental duplication, is associated with positive selection for increased fertility for the Icelandic population. Additionally, an increased copy number of CCL3L1 due to duplication is associated with decreased susceptibility to the HIV infection.  Human Y Chromosome  The human Y chromosome contains the greatest proportion of duplicated sequence within the human genome at 50.4%. The majority of the chromosome (41Mb out of 63Mb) is made up of three blocks of highly reiterated satellites and other repeats. The other 22Mb euchromatin region also has a unique genetic structure with large gene-rich palindromes. Segmental duplications in the euchromatin/heterochromatin transition regions on the human Y chromosome = Difficulty in mapping pericentromeric regions = On the human Y chromosome as well as other primate Y chromosomes, the pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions are the most important. The pericentromeric region is the area around the centromere of the chromosome. However, there exist issues in mapping of these pericentromeric issues. Primarily, pericentromeric regions exhibit a high degree of similarity (>98%). From this, it becomes increasingly difficult to disassemble sequence contigs using whole genome shotgun approaches. To solve this issue, a new technique was developed to allow for facilitation of mapping of pericentromeric regions. They key breakthrough was that this new methodology allowed for the detection of these overlaps. This was accomplished by using a transchromosomal assay rather than a cis-based approach for detection. This new method has allowed for the detection of BAC clones as well as the previously-difficult to determine heterochromatin parts of the pericentromeric regions. This allows for closer study of these regions. = Pericentromeric region in Yq11 = The pericentromeric region on the Y chromosome is a 450kb euchromatin island between the satellite three sequence and the long arm of the chromosome. Whole genome assembly comparison experiments revealed that 80.2% of the pericentromeric sequence of the Y chromosome is composed of segmental duplications with 73.8% and 5.3% of the DNA duplicated interchromosomally and intrachromosomally respectively. It is estimated that it has a recent origin to within the last thirty million year of primate evolution. Further FISH testing confirms that the segment is highly duplicated and that the majority of the signals is located near the centromeric region of the chromosome. In addition, the pericentromeric Yq11 region shares long stretches of sequence with chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 10, 16, and 22. For this same region, thirty-six modules are distributed interchromosomally while only one module is distributed intrachromosomally. There are twenty genes segments on the Yq11 region and thirteen of them are believed to not be functional genes. Eight of these gene segments display features of degenerated processed pseudogenes while five of them display partial exon-intron structure. = Multi-copy ampliconic genes on msrY = The msrY is the male-specific region of the Y chromosome in marsupial and placental mammals. On this Y chromosome, ampliconic genes are present in multiple copies. This group of genes undergo gene conversion. The ampliconic genes evolve faster than their autosomal counterparts. In fact, they even evolve faster than single-copy genes located on the Y chromosome. Finally, these ampliconic genes evolve faster in modern human and chimpanzees as compared to the Old World monkeys of the past. = Evolutionary dynamics of segmental duplication = The male-specific region of the Y chromosome contains a mosaic of heterochromatic sequences. It is also made up of three classes of euchromatic sequence, which are the ampliconic genes, X-transposed, and X-degenerate. It has also been shown that an additional euchromatic sequence exists for the Yq11 region of the Y chromosome. These regions are all primarily interchromosomal. There are also three additional euchromatin/heterochromatin transition regions for a total of four on the Y chromosome. Together, these are Yp11.2/Yp11.1, Yq11.1/Yq11.21, Yq11.23/Yq12, and Yq12/PAR2. Of these four regions, the Yq11.23/Yq12 region is unique in its structure as it is composed of recurrent TPTE and SLC25A15 duplicons which have originated from different long arms regions of chromosome 13. Furthermore, the Yp11.2/Yp11.1 and Yq11.1/Yq11.21 regions contain the more ancient duplications and are predominantly located in the subtelomeric regions. Nowadays, these duplications prefer to map to the pericentromeric regions in the modern human and chimpanzee. There has been a shift from the subtelomeric regions of the Old World monkeys to the pericentromeric regions of the modern primate. This evolutionary change coincides with the shortening of the subtelomeric regions as well as the development of higher-order alpha- satellites. = Yp11.2/Yp11.1 transition region = This is the only region which does not show any homologies to segmental duplication of other chromosomes with more than 95% sequence identity. Lowering the stringency conditions, homologues can be ascertained with chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 16, and 18. There exist three copies of this human region on the chimpanzee Y chromosome with two surrounding the Y chromosome centromere and the third located at Yp11.2. Both the human region and the homologous chimpanzee region are encompassed by typical alpha-satellite DNA found near the chromosome centromeres. The first duplicative transposition occurred about 1.2mya with a second larger genomic sequence invert occurring 880,000ya. = Yq11.1/Yq11.21 transition region = The chimpanzee Y chromosome completely spans the orthologous part of the human region, and the human region is completely included in the orthologous chimpanzee region. The segmental duplications are primarily consistent between the two genomes with the exception of chromosomes 1, 11, and 14 unable to be located on the chimpanzee genome. = Yq11.23/Yq12 and Yq12/PAR2 transition regions = When looking at the Yq11.23/Yq12 region, many segmental duplications can be found on both the human and chimpanzee chromosomes with the exception of a couple giving a 93% matching rate. However, orthologous sequences were unable to be detected for the Yq12/PAR2 transition region. It has been shown that segmental duplications from the Yq11.1/Yq11.21, Yq11.23/Yq12, and Yq12/PAR2 transition regions shows a predisposition to accumulate in the pericentromeric regions of both the human and chimpanzee genome. = Non-human primate interchromosomal segmental duplication = Analysis of the Sumatran orangutan, white-tufted ear marmoset, greater bushbaby, and grey mouse lemur yielded the discovery of eight new duplicons, which correspond to more ancient duplication events. Furthermore, this shows that these duplicons have diverged more than the other mammalian species. In addition, four mutated retrotransposon insertions were shown to have simulated the entire existence of additional ancestral duplicons illustrating the need for sequencing of the euchromatin/heterochromatin transition regions for these mammals.

Following a stint with the electric bass at 16 he discovered the instrument that would come to be most associated with him when he began studying the Double Bass.  Career  Adam began his musical career performing in jazz clubs and cafes and playing with several local musicians and ensembles. He got his early break in 2008 when his upright bass version of the theme tune for the TV show Seinfeld as well as his rendition of Michael Jackson's \\"Billie Jean\\" gained viral success. This caught the attention of American label CandyRat Records who released the singles \\"Openland\\" and \\"Flamenco\\" in 2012. That same year Adam's playing was featured on the Amnesty International 'Chimes Of Freedom: The Songs Of Bob Dylan' album playing on songwriter Oren Lavie's version of the track \\"4Th Time Around\\". 2013 was a key year for Adam with solo shows in Europe and the United States including appearances at the International Society Of Bassists convention in Rochester, NY, :fr:Gaume Jazz Festival in Belgium, and Musica In Borgo in Termoli, Italy, where he also featured as a guest artist during Sarah Jane Morris' set. In addition he supported the likes of Richard Bona, Mike Stern and Victor Wooten. He also appeared on a cover of the Pearl Jam track 'Jeremy' by the metal band Orphaned Land. A few months later Adam began his ongoing collaboration with internationally renowned singer Achinoam Nini (\\"Noa\\"), appearing on her 2014 album Love Medicine as well as joining her on tours in North America and Europe that included a show with George Dalaras and Dulce Pontes at the Acropolis in Athens. In 2014 Adam joined renowned classical musicians Igudesman & Joo (Aleksey Igudesman and Hyung-ki Joo) for their League Of X-traordinary Musicians Showpiece, performing a New Year's Eve show at the Vienna Konzerthaus alongside a talented multinational ensemble. That same year he also formed the new Adam Ben Ezra Trio which toured Europe including performances at Catania Jazz Festival in Italy. In 2015 Adam crowd-funded his debut album Can‚Äôt Stop Running through a PledgeMusic campaign. The cover art for the album, photographed by Ezra Gozo Mansur, was also selected as one of the best photos of 2015 by Communication Arts magazine. In the summer of 2015 Adam appeared at the Pilsen Festival and Pacovsk√Ω Poledn√≠k Festival as well as a sold-out show at the Jazz Dock Club in Prague as part of his tour in the Czech Republic. Later that year he again joined forces with Igudesman & Joo at the 'Lucerne Festival' in Switzerland, and also performed solo concerts at The Romanian National Opera, in Timi»ôoara, Romania and at the Double Bass Passion Festival in Belgrade, Serbia. Besides of playing other tours, Adam published the albums \\"Pin Drop\\" at Ropeadope Records in 2017 and \\"Hide and Seek\\" in 2020.  Youtube  In addition to his live music playing Adam has made a name for himself through his YouTube channel. To date his videos have gained more than 7 million views and his original video for \\"Can't Stop Running\\" has generated more than 1 million views. He is well known for his takes on TV theme songs such as 'Dexter' and 'Mad Men'.  Influences  Adam has cited Bach, Sting, Debussy, Chick Corea, Eddie Gomez and Jaco Pastorius, Flamenco and Arabic music as his musical inspiration. Adam is considered a pioneer in a new style of playing on the upright bass, in which he plays and drums on his instrument at the same time in order to obtain a rich groove sound.  Instruments  As well as playing the double bass, he is known for incorporating various instruments in his live performances and recordings, including the piano, bass guitar, guitar, clarinet, oud, flute and cajon, and for his use of a loop and effect pedals.
