He had oversight of the company's operating divisions: Kaplan Test Prep and Kaplan Higher Education in the United States, and Kaplan International based in London, UK and with operations across Europe, Asia, and Australia until his resignation was announced in July 2015. Leppert served as the 59th mayor of Dallas, Texas from 2007 to 2011, and previously worked as CEO of the Turner Corporation. Leppert announced in February 2011 that he would run for the 2012 United States Senate election in Texas. His Senate campaign ended with a third-place finish in the May 29, 2012 Republican primary election.  Early life, education, and early career  Leppert is a graduate of Claremont McKenna College, where he earned a Bachelor's Degree in economics with cum laude honors in 1977 and served as Student Body President. He then went on to attend Harvard Business School, where he received a M.B.A. with Distinction in 1979. Leppert served as a White House Fellow in the Reagan Administration in 1984 and 1985. He was one of 13 fellows chosen from 1,247 applicants by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. During his fellowship, Leppert worked for the secretary of the Treasury and on the White House staff. On May 17, 2008, Leppert received an honorary doctorate from his undergraduate alma mater, Claremont McKenna College, for which he serves as a trustee. Leppert told graduates to \\"know your principles\\" and encouraged them to write them down. \\"This may sound simple and obvious, but over the course of a lifetime, it may be one of the most difficult promises you ever keep. I know I am confronted by this each and every day. Simply stated, using generic terms like honesty and integrity are not near enough[...] People rarely get in trouble or lose their compass in one fell swoop... it is a series of small compromises, missteps that lead to a landslide... and a lost sense of self.\\" In the same speech, Leppert called his visit to Auschwitz a \\"single day [that] changed the way I looked at the world.\\" Leppert is a member of First Baptist Church Dallas and was formerly a member of the Dallas Country Club (prior to resigning in December 2006 due to his concern that the club's tradition of refusing membership to black applicants could become an issue during the mayoral campaign). He and his wife Laura have two sons and a daughter. Leppert grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. Leppert was a member of the youth leadership organization DeMolay International and rose up the ranks of Arizona DeMolay to become State Master Councilor (State President) in 1972‚Äì1973. He was inducted into the DeMolay International Hall of Fame in 2010. He attended college at Harvard University, where upon graduation in 1979, worked in Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and New York City before moving to Dallas between 1986 and 1989; in 1989, he moved to Honolulu, where he resided until 1999 (when he became CEO of the Turner Corporation). Upon joining Turner, he relocated to the Park Cities (an affluent suburb of Dallas) and moved the holding company's headquarters to Dallas. He moved to Dallas in 2003.  Business career  Leppert was chairman and CEO of the Turner Corporation (a subsidiary of German construction company Hochtief AG) prior to being elected mayor of Dallas. Turner Construction Company (a subsidiary of Turner Corp.) is currently the largest commercial builder in the United States. Leppert credits himself with earning more profits for the company during his seven-year tenure than in the company's previous 97 years combined, and moving a related holding company headquarters (employing 15 people, including Leppert) from New York City to Dallas; Turner Construction continues to be headquartered in New York. During his career, Leppert also held positions at McKinsey & Co., Trammell Crow Company, Bank of Hawaii, and Castle & Cooke Properties, Inc. Leppert was elected to the Board of Directors of Washington Mutual (at the time, the largest savings and loan association in the United States) in 2005; as part of his election, he was also named to the Board of Directors' Governance and Audit committees. During Leppert's time on the Board of Directors, Washington Mutual collapsed ‚Äî the largest bank failure in American financial history. Leppert became President and Chief Operating Officer of Kaplan, Inc. in January 2013, assuming day-to- day oversight of the company's operating divisions: Kaplan Test Prep and Kaplan Higher Education in the United States, and Kaplan International, with operations across Europe, Asia, and Australia. In April 2014, Leppert became CEO of Kaplan, Inc. = Awards = Leppert received the Torch of Conscience award from the Dallas-based Southwest region of the American Jewish Congress in 2006, the Russell H. Perry Free Enterprise Award from Dallas Baptist University for achievement in free enterprise and service to the community in 2009, and the Distinguished Business Leader award from the Dallas chapter of the Texas Association of Business in 2010. He was also named a 2007 \\"Business Person of the Year\\" finalist by the Dallas Business Journal, and \\"CEO Of The Year\\" by D Magazine in 2008. Inducted into the DeMolay International Hall of Fame in 2010.  Mayor of Dallas  Leppert defeated city councilman Ed Oakley in a runoff election June 16, 2007, winning with 58 percent of the vote. Some attribute his win to unexpected support from leaders within the African American community of the traditionally Democratic southern section of the city and his appeal to Republicans. While the office of mayor is officially non-partisan, like all municipal offices in Texas, Leppert is a Republican who participates in party fundraising events. After his first year in office, Leppert's runoff election opponent (Oakley) praised him for his leadership and for delivering on his campaign promises: \\"There's no question: Tom's done an excellent job. He's delivered on his priorities.\\" Shortly before Leppert's resignation, however, Oakley had second thoughts and publicly wondered whether Leppert was more interested in his own advancement than the city's. = Political positions and actions = In his inaugural address, Leppert stated that his first order of business would be to \\"reach out to everybody [and] include everybody from everywhere\\" and he emphasized a need to change the City Council's tone, stating: \\"rather than punishing business, City Hall needs to start promoting business.\\" As he did during the mayoral campaign, Leppert made education a theme of his inaugural address, proclaiming: \\"when a big issue like underperforming schools is holding back an entire city and hindering our growth, then it is everyone's problem.\\" With respect to crime, he said the council must use two objectives by which to judge its crime-fighting performance: lowering Dallas' typically high crime-rate ranking among the nation's largest cities, and building confidence and trust in all Dallas neighborhoods for police and fire personnel. Finally, he firmly restated his commitment to enact the Trinity River Corridor plan, calling the project \\"a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and it will be the catalyst that puts Dallas on the world stage, if we seize the moment and get it done.\\" Two years into his term, Leppert had won support from a core coalition of Dallas City Council members (Dwaine Caraway, Dave Neumann, and Ron Natinsky), who voted with Leppert more than 92 percent of the time, a rate roughly equal to his record of being on the winning side of council roll call votes. Indeed, Caraway even went so far as to declare that he \\"would take a bullet\\" for the Mayor during a heated debate over the Trinity River Project. Leppert donated his mayoral salary to a scholarship fund for students from low-income families. In his campaign for Texas Senator in 2012, Leppert ran ads that characterized his opponents as \\"empty suits\\".  Crime reduction  Leppert ran on the pledge of reducing crime and increasing the number of police officers in the city of Dallas. He helped add 200 new police officers to the city's ranks, which coincided with a drop in crime rates each year Leppert was in office‚Äîincluding a 10% reduction in 2010.  Economic development and jobs  In January 2008, Mayor Leppert embarked on a trade mission to Monterrey, Mexico, to promote Dallas's medical, educational, and corporate institutions. Another part of the trip's agenda was to lobby on behalf of an inland seaport in the Dallas area. Leppert was joined by more than a dozen officials from city government, the Dallas Independent School District and various health care and commercial institutions in the largest mission of its kind in years. One of the agreements reached on the trip include a plan for an MD/PhD program in Mexico provided by UT Southwestern Medical School. Leppert also stated that Mexican President Felipe Calder√≥n would be visiting Dallas on his next visit to the United States. Following his trip to Mexico, Leppert led a trade mission to China and signed \\"friendship city\\" agreements with major industrial cities such as Dalian and Qingdao. Leppert also oversaw the negotiation of business deals with Chinese officials, such as advocacy of investment in the Dallas Inland Port and the placement of a Chinese telecommunication firm's U.S. headquarters in Dallas. Leppert is also credited with persuading AT&T; to relocate to Dallas as well as encouraging the start-up of a new $15 million call center that plans to ultimately employ 300 workers.  Convention center hotel  In December 2008, Leppert began lobbying the Obama administration for $386 million in Community Development Block Grant funds to be awarded by the federal government for the purpose of building a new convention center hotel in downtown Dallas (a project that had been on Dallas' drawing board for nearly two decades), stating: \\"Let's use this as an opportunity. Most of the economy in the country is in metro areas. Let's make sure we use this (stimulus) money much as we did back in the 1930s, so that when we come out we have a much stronger economy and we're in a much better position.\\" Following the federal government's failure to approve Leppert's request for stimulus funds, in February 2009 he announced plans to seek an alternate form of financing. He argued that if Dallas did not build the hotel, it would fall further behind other cities in the competition for convention and tourism business, and that larger conventions would not even consider Dallas because it does not have a hotel attached to its convention center. He also argued that, because it would attract more visitors to Dallas, the building of the hotel would lead to a broadening of Dallas' tax base and an increase in jobs and sales tax revenue to the city. In May 2009, he successfully lobbied the City Council to approve spending $42 million to purchase land on which the proposed hotel would be located. The project was financed with $388.2 million in federally-subsidized revenue bonds issued under the Obama administration's Build America Bonds program (which means that the federal government reimburses the city 35% of the interest associated with the issue) and $91.7 million in conventional hotel revenue bonds ($479.9 million total). Repayment is anticipated to come from a combination of $249.1 million in direct subsidies from the federal government (associated with the Build America Bonds), $212.9 million in pledged state and city occupancy and sales taxes associated with the property's operation, and the remainder from hotel net operating income. In addition, the bonds are further backed by a \\"Moral Obligation Pledge\\" from the City of Dallas to cover any shortfalls. The hotel broke ground in 2009 and is projected to open in 2012. In an effort to reinforce the success of the hotel, Leppert led the City Council to lobby Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) to change the alignment of a proposed light rail line through downtown; under Leppert's plan, the line would be diverted from the center of downtown to stop at the hotel and would include a subway segment that would travel beneath the convention center to an underground station at City Hall before rejoining the original alignment. DART staff, however, reported that, at $824 million, the proposed realignment would be more expensive than all other options being considered, exceeding the cost of the cheapest alignment by $315 million. They also pointed out that the Federal Transit Administration makes the final call on where the route should go, and the hotel alignment had been shown to attract fewer riders, at higher costs, than other options. Nevertheless, Leppert continued to serve as a strong advocate for the realignment, stating: \\"The hotel alignment serves downtown's transportation needs and supports the public and private investment in our city's core.\\"  Education  On February 21, 2008, Leppert unveiled The Every Child Ready to Read @ Dallas program. This program was part of Leppert's larger plan to improve Dallas's education system which was unveiled in 2007.  Ethics and open government  In December 2007, Leppert released his ethics plan that would ban city council members from accepting free tickets to events, and modernize the city's campaign finance disclosure system by creating a searchable, online campaign finance database and requiring electronic filing of campaign finance reports for political candidates in the city. In March 2008, the city council approved Leppert's electronic campaign finance filing system proposal. In November 2009, the city council passed a series of four ethics reforms championed by Leppert that: * Required lobbyists to register with the city * Limited campaign contributions from developers * Required disclosure of gifts to council members over $50 * Required two city council members to \\"second\\" major zoning cases and certify they have reviewed the details of the zoning case before the matter can be voted on = Love Field no-bid concessions contract extensions = Leppert ignited a controversy when he opposed no-bid concessions contract extensions with current Love Field food vendor Star Concessions Ltd. and newspaper and book vendor Hudson Retail Dallas during a March 3, 2010, city council meeting. Leppert insisted that the contracts should be opened to public bidding instead. Leppert demanded that city staff‚Äîwho backed the extensions‚Äîappear before the full council and explain why the concessions contracts were not opened to public bidding. On February 22, 2010, the city council's Transportation and Environment Committee had previously voted to extend contracts with the existing concessions for through 2026 with an additional 3-year option and exclusive rights to 54 percent of vending space in a new terminal scheduled to open in 2014, instead of opening the contract up to public bidding In an April 26, 2010, editorial, The Dallas Morning News called the lack of transparency and fiduciary responsibility \\"troubling\\". The Dallas Morning News noted that the situation was complicated by the fact that the concessions operators were partially owned by two elected officials‚ÄîState Representative Helen Giddings and U.S. Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson. On May 21, 2010, The Dallas Morning News reported that Assistant City Manager A.C. Gonzalez said that city staff recommended in June 2007 that all concession space in the renovated airport be opened up for competitive bids, but that plan was opposed by city council members. On June 9, 2010, The Dallas Morning News reported that airport consultants said that the no-bid plan was unusual and could result in an inferior deal for the city. According to a June 17, 2010 article in the Dallas Observer, Gilbert Aranza‚Äîowner of Star Concessions Ltd.‚Äîaccused Leppert of hypocrisy given his support for similar no-bid contract extensions during his tenure on the D/FW Airport Board. In an apparent victory for Leppert, the city council voted on August 18, 2010, to open all concessions space in the new terminal for public bidding; city staff would attempt to reach a deal with Star and Hudson to operate existing concessions space from 2011 to 2014, otherwise it would also be opened for public bidding.  Property tax rate increases  During candidate Leppert's 2007 mayoral campaign, he ran a television commercial featuring Dallas Cowboys legend Roger Staubach telling Dallasites, \\"I hope you'll say 'no' to new taxes by saying 'yes' to Tom Leppert.\\" However, in September of that year he voted with the majority of the Dallas City Council in a successful push to raise taxes, hailing the budget as a good deal for Dallas residents, balancing a modest tax increase against a bevy of improved city services. In subsequent years, however, Leppert opposed property tax rate increases in the city of Dallas and proposed spending cuts to balance the budget. In 2008, despite early calls for another property tax rate increase, Leppert successfully led opposition to prevent another rate increase. Leppert also successfully led opposition to another proposal to increase property tax rates in 2009. In 2010, once again, Leppert led the opposition of yet another property tax rate increase proposal. In response to the estimated $130 million shortfall in the city's $2 billion budget, Leppert crafted a new budget proposal to close the budget gap without increasing taxes. Despite Leppert's strong objections, the city council voted by an 8-7 majority to pass a 6.5% property tax rate increase anyway‚Äîthe largest in 20 years. = Electoral history = After receiving a plurality of votes among a crowded field of candidates in the 2007 Dallas Mayoral Election, Leppert won a spot in a runoff election along with Dallas City Council member Ed Oakley. Leppert was victorious in the runoff election.  Political future  In late 2008, it was widely rumored that Leppert would run in a potential special election for Kay Bailey Hutchison's United States Senate seat, which she was widely expected to vacate during her run for Texas governor; in a December newspaper interview, Leppert denied he had started to campaign, but he refused to entirely rule out the possibility. However, Hutchison retained her Senate seat, and her gubernatorial campaign ended when she lost the 2010 Texas Republican primary to incumbent Rick Perry. Rumors soon circulated that Leppert was considering a Senate run directly against Hutchison in 2012, a possibility he did not refute during an April 2010, interview. In January 2011, Leppert announced that he would not seek re-election to the office of mayor in May. This further fueled speculation that he was planning a run for the now open U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Hutchison. On February 22, 2011, it was reported that Leppert would announce his resignation from the office of mayor the next day. The Washington Post noted that this is a necessary first step for his expected run for Senate because Dallas law prohibits the mayor from running for another office while still serving as mayor. Leppert resigned his seat as mayor effective at midnight on February 25, 2011. He told The Dallas Morning News that his campaign for the U.S. Senate would begin immediately, with Mike Slanker, former political director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, acting as his chief campaign consultant. Leppert was eliminated from the U.S. Senate race after finishing third in the May 29, 2012 Republican primary election, earning 13.3% of the votes cast. Former Texas Solicitor General Ted Cruz eventually won the 2012 Republican nomination for the open Senate seat, defeating Lt. Governor David Dewhurst in the Republican primary runoff by 57% to 43% on July 31, 2012.Office of the Secretary of State, 2012 Republican Party Primary Runoff, Election Night Returns, July 31, 2012.

It was designed by architect Juan M. Arellano and inaugurated on December 10, 1931.  Conception of theater  In 1862, the Teatro del Pr√≠ncipe Alfonso XII was built within Plaza Arroceros, near the present-day Metropolitan Theater. This theater stood until 1876, when the old theater was burnt down. It was in 1924, during the American Colonial period that the idea of constructing a theater in Manila came about. The Philippine Legislature then approved Senator Alegre's proposal to build a theater within the Mehan Garden (now Sining Kayumanggi). The construction began in 1930 under the supervision of the architecture firm of Pedro Siochi and Company in an 8,239.58 square meter area of the park. It was inaugurated on December 10, 1931. This new theater housed different performances from zarzuelas, dramas to translations of foreign classics.  History of theater  Juan Arellano, one of the first pensionados in architecture, also known for his other major projects such as the Legislative Building and Manila Central Post Office Building, designed the Manila Metropolitan Theater in January 1930. He was sent to the United States to be guided by one of the experts in designing theaters, Thomas W. Lamb of Shreve and Lamb. The theater's roof and walls were partially destroyed during World War II. During the post-war period, it was misused as a boxing arena, low-quality motel, gay bar, basketball court and as a home for squatters. In 1978, a restoration of the theater was initiated by the then Governor of Metro Manila Imelda Marcos which was headed by Otilio, the nephew of Juan Arellano. Its prestige as a cultural center was redeemed but proved to be short-lived. It closed down its doors again in 1996 because of conflicts of ownership between the Manila City Administration and the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS). In 2010, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Manila mayor Alfredo Lim tried to revive the theater but to no avail. The theater was used again once for a Wolfgang concert in 2011. But since 2012, the theater was closed again due to decays inside the building. The structure continued to deteriorate and vandalism, political advertisements, promotional materials and trash now degrade the heritage theater. The theater has been protected using pieces of wood, scrap electrical wires and rundown plywood. Alleged paranormal activities in the theater was also reported.I-Witness, GMA-7. (July 13, 2013). \\"Kasaysayan at Misteryo ng Manila Metropolitan Theater, aalamin sa I-Witness\\" Help continued to pour in at that time but lacked any concrete direction. In May 2015, the Department of Budget and Management released Php 270 Million from the National Endowment Fund for Culture and the Arts for the sale of the theater from its owner, the GSIS. In June 2015, the GSIS transferred the right of ownership of the theater to the National Commission for Culture and the Arts to start the rehabilitation process of the Met. Clean-up drives were started in December 2015, paving the way for the eventual restoration of the building by 2016. As of October 2019, renovations have been ongoing. The restoration project is planning to open the two wings of the theater by 2020 and open the new Metropolitan Theater Complex by 2021.  Architecture  The concept of the theater was explained by Juan M. Arellano, the architect, during one of his interviews in January 1930. Arellano was influenced by early Filipino art which uses local motifs and diverse imagery of Philippine flora. Aside from his knowledge on Filipino art was the factor of economy which both helped the architect in having a modern design approach to the theater. Meanwhile, the phrase ‚Äúon wings of song‚Äù gave the structural configuration, a box-shaped auditorium flanked by pavilions on both sides. The mix of modernization and romanticization resulted in A. V. H. Hartendrop labeling it as modern expressionism. The Metropolitan Theater fa√ßade resembles a stage being framed by a proscenium-like central window of stained glass which carries the name ‚ÄúMetropolitan‚Äù with flora and fauna motif surrounding the label. This helps bring in light to the lobby. It was highlighted on both ends by the curving walls with colorful decorated tiles in resemblance with the batik patterns from Southeast Asia. There are also moldings of zigzag and wavy lines that go with the sponged and painted multi-colored massive walls. The wall that framed the stained glass is a segmented arch with rows of small finials on the upper edge of the wall. Angkor Wat-inspired minarets crown the top of the concave roof which suggested its status as a theater back in its prime days. Located in the entrance are elaborate wrought iron gates which are patterned into leaf designs and various lines. Accenting the ground level are Capiz lamps and banana-leaf formed pillars which go alternately with the theater's entrances.

The ceiling profile of the auditorium was reflected in the exterior through stepped vaults. There were different artists who collaborated in this project especially inside the theater. Located at the main lobby were sculptures of Adam and Eve done by Francesco Riccardo Monti,who resided in Manila from 1930 up to his death in 1958.Sculptural treasures by Francesco Riccardo Monti - 1INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos Isabelo Tampingco, a Filipino artist designed the Philippine plant-themed carvings in the interior spaces including the lobby while National Artist Fernando Amorsolo painted the murals The Dance and The History of Music located at the ends of the balcony. The grillwork on small balconies looking out into the foyer was exceptionally elegant transitions from Art Nouveau to Art Deco, expressed by Lourdes Montinola in her book. The two black posts at the bottom of the staircases were decorated with glass mosaic tiles. The main auditorium projects a different character as compared to the building envelope's ornamentality. A sequence of gradually lowered arches made of local wood, enhanced by panels with colorful motifs. These motifs were a combination of mangoes, bananas, and foliage painted by the brother of Juan Arellano, Arcadio. There are 2 organ chambers. Both are above on the walls beside the orchestral pit. the organ was never installed and the chambers are empty and there are no plans to install one. On top of the proscenium are figures symbolic of Music, Tragedy, Poetry and Comedy.Resembling bamboo stalks are the tapering lamps of translucent glass which surround the theater space. The focal point is the rectangular stage adorned with mango fruits and leaves motif.Coconuts Manila. (February 11, 2014). 15 Heritage Buildings that Need to be Rescued. The crystal lamps made from bamboo stalks which vertically light up the hall are the first in the country in terms of indirect lighting. It is also a new character of Art Deco during that period. The theater, according to some people has good acoustics and lighting and a large seating capacity of 1,670 (846 orchestra, 116 in loge, and 708 in balcony) which housed performances, operas, concerts, and plays for more than a decade.Tiongson, Nicanor (1978) Reopening souvenir of the Metropolitan Theatre during President Ferdinand Marcos It also continued up to the Japanese occupation where Zarzuelas, Filipino operas, films and stage were shown. Events hosted The Manila Metropolitan Theaters housed performances by international artists like Ted Shawn, Jascha Heifetz, Amelita Galli-Curci and Fritz Kreisler and local shows such as the ‚ÄúSmiles of 1936,‚Äù ‚ÄúQuerer Ranchero‚Äù and ‚ÄúLuisa Fernando‚Äù were all part of the decade that followed its inauguration. The first cartoon featuring Mickey Mouse in the Philippines was screened in the theater and the first film of LVN Pictures, Giliw Ko premiered in the theater on July 29, 1939, a screening attended by then-President Manuel Quezon. It was still active during the Japanese occupation showing support even for the guerrilla underground. The MET was once the home of the Manila Symphony Orchestra but they refused to perform there during the occupation, prompting the Japanese to make the New Philippines Symphony Orchestra.Pablo A.Tariman.

Launched in 2007, the station broadcasts 24 hours a day on 102.5 FM, and online via its website. The station is owned by CBIT (Community Broadcast Initiative Tyneside Ltd). They were awarded a five- year community broadcast licence by Ofcom in 2006, which has since been extended to 2022. Nova Radio NE carries a wide variety of content, catering for both mainstream and niche musical genres, and also broadcasts interviews and sports, talk and comedy-based shows. Nova Radio NE has broadcast more than 100 different shows during its time on-air, including enabling members of the local community to present as part of its open access programming. The station also broadcasts from musical and other events in the local area, promotes local bands, and highlights community issues on a regular basis. The name was a play on the postcode district NE1 (where the station was originally located). In addition to the station's community radio status where \\"anyone\\" can apply to broadcast or help out with the station's off-air operation.Article in The Evening Chronicle, 7 June 2007 In June 2019, the station was rebranded to Nova Radio North East as the station was taken over, and merged with an online station of the same name in Newcastle.  History  = 2004‚Äì2007: Pre-projects and station launch = Prior to the formation of the project leading to the launch, a number of Restricted Service Licence broadcasts had taken place in Newcastle upon Tyne, many of which were operated by or involved founding members of the station. These included ACE Radio, West End Broadcast and City FM, the latter of which ran from 13 September 2004 to 9 October 2004. Following this broadcast, an application for Ofcom's advertised community radio licence for the area was made on 19 November 2004. The application of Community Broadcast Initiative Tyneside was successful, with a five-year licence awarded in 2006. The radio station launched on 8 June 2007 with a weekend of broadcasts from Newcastle's Green Festival, resulting in much of the launch weekend being conducted via an outside broadcast studio at Leazes Park. During the weekend, the station broadcast a large amount of live music, particularly electronic music, interspersed with interviews with festival participants and general continuity from a variety of on-air personnel. On Monday 11 June 2007, the stations regular schedule commenced with the long-running alternative music show Unknown Pleasures.Unknown Pleasures, June 2007 = 2007‚Äì2009: Transmitter thefts and programming expansions = logo used from June 2007-August 2012 In the months following the launch, regular programming included Alternation, Atomic, Pavement Pizza and The Hedley Show. Broadcasts also took place from a number of other festivals, including the Asian-orientated Mela Festival,NE1fm Myspace blog, 30 August 2007 and the Newcastle stage of the AV Festival in March 2008,AV Festival official website although broadcasts from the latter were met with problems and resulted in broadcasts ceasing before the festival's conclusion. Other festivals and outside events covered throughout the station's first year included the 2008 Irish Festival and the 2008 Eat Festival. The station was, in November 2007, presented with a plaque by hardware chain B&Q; as part of their annual You Can Do It awards, resulting in ¬£5,000 of funding to fully construct a second studio and improve the station's primitive facilities. The second studio was completed shortly thereafter. The station also during this period had its transmission equipment stolen, resulting in two off-air stints in December 2007 and March 2008, the latter of which was covered as the headline story on local news programme North East Tonight later that day. Throughout 2008 and 2009, the station continued to broadcast a wide variety of on-air content, with a number of long-running shows catering to audiences largely ignored by commercial radio stations in the region. Long-running shows included The Groove Principle, a soul music show, and Anyone For Country, a specialist country music broadcast. During this time period, however, a number of long-running shows ended their tenure on the station ‚Äì either permanently or temporarily ‚Äì including Ghetto Method and The Takeover. The station also occasionally broadcast breakfast and lunchtime shows, although largely focused on evening broadcasts, with largely uninterrupted music broadcast overnight and during the day. = 2009‚Äì2010: Station relocation and programming changes = In late 2009, the station went through its most significant period of change since its launch in 2007, relocating from the Shieldfield area of Newcastle upon Tyne to purpose-built studios at Virginia House, which are shared with the community group The Cyrenians. Although this did not affect the broadcast area of NE1fm, it marked the end of thirty months of broadcast in a church building that had not typically been designed for radio broadcast, and allowed for the station to make further changes to its operation and sound. Shortly after the move, shifts in the station's management structure also occurred, with a number of founding members quoted on the initial Ofcom application ceasing to be involved with the station. The station also updated its website after three years of limited updates. Along with the relocation, a number of programming changes also occurred during this time period. One significant change was the end of The Live Session, a weekly acoustic broadcast that had featured and given exposure to a large quantity of local and little-known bands during NE1fm's time on-air; The Live Session's departure, however, was intended to be brief, with the station advertising for a replacement presenter for the show. A new live music show, Hit the North (East), debuted in late 2010. The station also began to focus areas of its programming toward younger people, with a larger amount of new music played during the day and coverage of popular events including Evolution Festival. = 2011 ‚Äì 2012: Recent developments, downtime and return to FM = The station Logo launched in August 2012 and used until June 2017 The first months of 2011 included the announcement that the station's soul programming, featured prominently on Sundays since launch, would be discontinued. Soul music has since returned in a smaller capacity. Programming of significance early in the year included special programmes covering Gateshead F.C.'s run in the 2011 FA Trophy, the launch of the community-focused broadcast No Excuse, and the re-branding of the weekend breakfast shows to include live music, including a variety from the 2011 Evolution Emerging line-up. The digital presence of the station was overhauled during Spring of 2011, including visibly heightened usage of their Facebook and Twitter accounts and the launch of a new website. A second edition of the new website appeared in February 2012, including the introduction of show blogs and a section promoting music from local artists. On 27 September 2011, station volunteers Rob Davies and Gary Barnes launched a locally high-profile attempt to break the current world record for the longest team radio broadcast, previously held by Chris Moyles of BBC Radio 1, for the benefit of two local charities. Their attempt finished at midday on Friday 30 September, lasting a total of 76 hours, exceeding the previous record. In early 2012, the radio station added ethnic programming to the broadcast schedule for the first time in several years, offering representation to the Chinese, Polish and Persian-speaking Iranian communities of Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead. A Spanish language broadcast was added at a later date In February 2012, the station announced the award of a five- year extension to its community radio licence, taking the project through until June 2017. However, in April 2012, the station ceased FM broadcasts due to an issue with the location of the station's transmitter requiring a full move of broadcast equipment. Although the station declared on its website that operations were continuing as normal online during this downtime, the station was cited as in breach of its broadcast licence by Ofcom in June 2012. NE1fm successfully returned to 102.5 FM on 7 August 2012. = 2014 - 2019: Relocation to Westgate College and Tenth Birthday = Logo launched in June 2017 to celebrate the tenth birthday. In October 2014, the station relocated from Virginia House to Westgate Community College, on the West side of Newcastle Upon Tyne. In June 2017, the station celebrated their 10th Birthday with a series of special broadcasts and the release of a new logo, shown below. In February 2019, the radio station was taken over by a new Director for CBIT, planning to relocate, create a new management team along with a new programming schedule to enable the station to be self sustaining. In February 2019, the station received a brand new logo, along with a brand new website. This logo was used for only a short amount of time, from February to June 2019. = As Nova Radio North East =  2019 - Present  Unfortunately, the previous management takeover of NE1fm fell through, and was passed on once again. This time, the new management consisted of a team who already ran an online community station in the area, 'Nova Radio North East'. In June 2019, these two stations were merged into one, forming the new 'Nova Radio North East 102.5FM'.

History  The ship was laid down as YMS-321 on 29 August 1942 by Al Larson Boat Shop Inc. of Terminal Island, California, launched 20 February 1943, sponsored by Mrs. H. Doty. The ship was completed and commissioned as USS YMS-321, 25 October 1943 with Lt. (j.g.) Newman in command. After shakedown and patrol out of San Diego, California, YMS-321 sailed for Pearl Harbor 21 April 1944, arriving 1 May. A month later she sailed for sweeping and patrol duties in the Guam-Saipan-Tinian area. YMS-321 was also pressed into service as a convoy escort in these staging areas, and on 28 November 1944 was in Tinian harbor during a Japanese air-raid. After escorting a convoy to Eniwetok, she swept the harbor at Maug Island, Marianas, 15 March 1945, and then bombarded the beach the following day. The wooden minesweeper patrolled around Iwo Jima in April 1945 and exploded two floating mines before returning to Saipan. As the long Pacific war drew to a close, YMS-321 returned to Pearl Harbor 15 August 1945, and from there returned to San Diego, California, 29 August. After overhaul and operations along the West Coast, she sailed for the East Coast 5 April 1946, arriving Charleston, South Carolina, on the 29th. YMS-321 was reclassified AMS-15 on 25 February 1947, and named USS Grouse. For the next 10 years the small coastal minesweeper operated along the East Coast in a variety of capacities. Although her primary duty was training student officers and enlisted men at the Mine Warfare School, Yorktown, Virginia, Grouse also participated in experimental work at Countermeasures School and Mine Defense Laboratory, at Panama City, Florida. Various minesweeping exercises and regular overhauls consumed most of the rest of her time, although in 1954 and 1955 she was attached to the Hydrographic Office for Project Vamp, a special coastal survey along the Virginia and Massachusetts shores. On 1 March 1955 Grouse was reclassified MSC(O)-15. Sailing to Portland, Maine, 7 September 1957, she decommissioned and was placed in reserve 12 September 1957. Grouse was placed in service, in reserve, 13 November 1958, Li. (j.g.) K. G. Houghton in command, and proceeded to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for overhaul. Assigned to the 1st Naval District as a reserve training ship, Grouse was based at Portsmouth and used to train reservists from the area in new minesweeping tactics. This work took her along the New England Coast as well as to Chesapeake Bay and to Charleston, South Carolina. While on a training mission, Grouse went aground off Rockport, Massachusetts, on the night of 21 September 1963. There were no injuries to the crew, but all efforts to dislodge Grouse from the rocks failed. Grouse was destroyed by explosives 28 September 1963, and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register the same day.

H. Mathews, which was subsequently revised by Harvard University Press in 1943. He served with the China Inland Mission from 1906, before retiring to Australia in 1945. Early life Robert Henry Mathews was born in Flemington, now a suburb of Melbourne, Australia on 13 July 1877, to London-born William Mathews and Australian Mary Mathews, n√©e Whitlaw. Mathews studied lithography at the Working Men's College of Melbourne, during which time he became interested in Christian missionary work. As an fervent Congregationalist, he was drawn to evangelism, especially the China Inland Mission (CIM). Although Mathews set up his own printing business after graduating, he abandoned it to join the CIM in 1906, receiving eighteen months' training in Adelaide where he ministered to the city's outcast poor.Ibid. Missionary in China CIM stations in 1902 Mathews left for China on 4 October 1908, stopping at the CIM headquarters in Shanghai for a short period before being despatched to Henan. In 1915 he was transferred to Huizhou (now a district of Huangshan), Anhui, where he is said to have found, as in Henan, \\"a peculiar lack of response to the Gospel message.\\"Ibid. Nevertheless, during his time in Anhui, Mathews' interest in the Chinese language deepened due to the variety of dialects he encountered. In 1921 Mathews returned to Henan, where he led Bible classes for the troops of the warlord Feng Yuxiang, a convert known as \\"the Christian General\\", whom the CIM supported. Mathews then travelled around Sichuan for the next four years, leading Bible classes and supervising Chinese seminarians. In 1926, Mathews returned to Melbourne, intending to take a brief holiday. However, the turmoil in China and evacuation of thousands of British missionaries forced him to extend his vacation until February 1928, when he returned to China.Ibid. The CIM headquarters, Shanghai On his return to the CIM Shanghai headquarters, the CIM tasked Mathews with revising F.W. Baller's Analytical Chinese-English Dictionary, first published in 1900. Mathews completed his Chinese-English Dictionary in 1931, a 1200-page volume. The CIM then commissioned Mathews to revise Baller's Mandarin Primer, first published in 1900. Mathews completed the Kuoy√º Primer: Progressive Studies in the Chinese National Language in 1938, totalling 790 pages.Ibid. In 1937 the Japanese army occupied the Chinese-administered districts of Shanghai. With the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, the foreign concessions were occupied, with European and American nationals eventually interned in 1943. In April 1943, Mathews and his wife, Violet, were interned in the Lunghua Civilian Assembly Centre, seven miles southwest of Shanghai. They were held in bleak conditions for two years until the surrender of Japan in August 1945. Later life Mathews returned to Melbourne in 1945. Three years later, the Australian Department of Defence engaged him to work on the translation of archival material and the compilation of glossaries. Initially a part-time position, this was extended to a full-time position from 1951. After six years, Mathews retired in 1957. For his linguistic achievement, the University of Melbourne awarded him an honorary Doctor of Letters degree.Ibid. Robert Henry Mathews died in Melbourne on 16 February 1970. Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary Beginning as a revision of Baller's Analytical Chinese-English Dictionary, Mathews' Chinese- English Dictionary Compiled for the China Inland Mission is a new and separate work. Writing in 1931, Mathews cites the \\"rapid changes which have taken place in China,\\" the \\"influx of modern inventions and the advance of scientific knowledge\\" as having given rise to new expressions in the thirty years since Baller's dictionary. This made Baller's dictionary out of date, necessitating the compiling of a new dictionary. Mathews included entries for 7,785 Chinese characters with over 104,400 examples drawn from both classical and modern sources. This means the dictionary provides sufficient vocabulary for the generally literate reader while fulfilling its aim to be \\"at once portable and inexpensive and at the same time sufficiently large\\". However, Mathews bases some of his definitions on Herbert A. Giles' Chinese-English Dictionary (1892; revised and enlarged 1912) without acknowledgment. Owing to these advantages, the Harvard‚ÄìYenching Institute selected Mathews' dictionary as one of two \\"practical dictionaries\\" to revise and reprint in 1943 for \\"the immediate demands of American students\\". At this point the supply of Chinese dictionaries had been severely curtailed by the war, leading to an \\"acute\\" shortage. The Harvard revision re-titled the dictionary Mathews' Chinese- English Dictionary, and contributes 15,000 correction of errors, revisions of pronunciation and definition, and new entries. In addition, Yuen Ren Chao wrote an introduction on pronunciation. Mathews himself had been working on a revised edition of his dictionary, but when the Japanese occupiers took over the original Shanghai headquarters of the CIM (which had moved headquarters in Shanghai in 1931, and moved to the temporary Republican capital in Chongqing in 1943), unbound copies of Mathews' revision were destroyed, along with printing blocks and the CIM's library. Nevertheless, the Harvard reprint brought Mathews' dictionary to greater prominence. Today it is known simply as Mathews', and has been considered a great resource for students of classical Chinese, although recent scholarship is beginning to supersede it in this role. Personal life Mathews married Anne Ethel Smith, an Australian CIM missionary from New South Wales in Shanghai on 30 December 1908, with whom he had three children. Anne Mathews died in 1920. In 1922 Mathews married Violet Ward, a missionary six years his junior. Violet Mathews closely assisted him in his linguistic work in China and Australia, and was herself a published writer. She died in 1954.

He was the owner of various clubs: * Perugia Calcio, a football club based in Perugia, Umbria. * Viterbese Calcio, a football club based in Viterbo, Lazio. * S.S. Sambenedettese Calcio, a football club based in San Benedetto del Tronto, Marche * Calcio Catania, a football club based in Catania, Sicily. He was also vice-president of the A.S. Roma football club during the presidential period of Dino Viola in the 1980s. He was born in Rome, Kingdom of Italy. Gaucci was owner of the famous castle Torre Alfina in Acquapendente, Lazio. Ahn controversy During the 2002 World Cup, South Korean player Ahn Jung-Hwan - then on loan to Gaucci's Perugia football club - scored a golden goal that eliminated Italy from the World Cup. Furious, Gaucci immediately made public comments about cancelling Ahn's contract and was quoted as saying, \\"I have no intention of paying a salary to someone who has ruined Italian football.\\" While he soon took back his words, and offered to outright buy Ahn's contract, Ahn rejected his penitence, with his agent stating, \\"He will never play again for Perugia... We will never consider his transfer to Perugia, which mounted a character assassination against Ahn just because he scored against Italy.\\" Thoroughbred horse racing Luciano Gaucci also owned Allevamento White Star, a Thoroughbred horse breeding and racing operation who gained international fame in the late 1980s with the European Champion thoroughbred Tony Bin, winner of six Group One races including France's most prestigious event, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Gaucci also owned multiple stakes race winner Sikeston as well as Dr Devious, a colt he sold to American weight loss guru Sidney H. Craig and who won England's 1992 Epsom Derby. Bankruptcy and escape After Perugia Calcio went bankrupt in 2005, the Italian magistrature started an inquiry into he and his sons Alessandro and Riccardo. Following these events, Luciano Gaucci escaped to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic where he stayed for four years in hiding. He was subsequently sentenced to a three-year suspended jail sentence.

The country performed at least 158 executions in 2015, at least 154 in 2016, at least 146 in 2017, at least 149 in 2018, with possibly 184 executed in 2019. Death sentences in Saudi Arabia are pronounced almost exclusively based on the system of judicial sentencing discretion (tazir) rather than Sharia-prescribed (hudud) punishments, following the classical principle that hudud penalties should be avoided if possible. The rise in death sentences during recent decades resulted from a concerted reaction by the government and the courts to a rise in violent crime during the 1970s and paralleled similar developments in the U.S. and Mainland China in the late 20th century. Despite having signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Saudi Arabia executed offenders who were juveniles at the time of the crime up until 26 April 2020, when the death penalty against juveniles was abolished by royal decree. Method Saudi Arabia has a criminal justice system based on a hardline and literal form of Shari'ah reflecting a particular state-sanctioned interpretation of Islam. Execution is usually carried out publicly by beheading with a sword but may occasionally be performed by shooting. In April 2020, minors who commit crimes will no longer face execution, and would instead face a maximum of 10 years in juvenile detention facility. A recent report by the European Saudi Organization for Human Rights (ESOHR) asserts that the number of beheadings in the kingdom during the first quarter of 2018 rose by over 70 percent compared to the same period in 2017. A public beheading will typically take place around 9 a.m. The convicted person is walked to a court yard near the court- house and kneels in front of the executioner. The executioner uses a sword known as a sulthan to remove the condemned person's head from his or her body at the neck. A police official announces the crimes committed by the person and the beheading takes place. After a medical examiner inspects the body and is then pronounced dead, a police official announces the crimes committed by the beheaded convict once again and the process is complete. This is the most common method of execution in Saudi Arabia because it is specifically called for by Sharia law and is one of the quickest methods of execution with little error percentile. Professional executioners have beheaded as many as 10 people in a single day in time of influxes of crime. Crucifixion of the beheaded body is sometimes ordered in cases that the person was a child molester and or rapist. For example, in 2009, the Saudi Gazette reported that \\"an Abha court had sentenced the leader of an armed gang to death and three-day crucifixion (public displaying of the beheaded body) and six other gang members to beheading for their role in jewelry store robberies in Asir.\\" (this practice resembles gibbeting, in which the entire body is displayed). In 2003, Muhammad Saad al-Beshi, whom the BBC described as \\"Saudi Arabia's leading executioner\\", gave a rare interview to Arab News. He described his first execution in 1998: \\"The criminal was tied and blindfolded. With one stroke of the sword I severed his head. It rolled metres away... People are amazed how fast [the sword] can separate the head from the body.\\" He also said that, before an execution, he visits the victim's family to seek forgiveness for the criminal, which can lead to the criminal's life being spared. Once an execution goes ahead, his only conversation with the prisoner is to tell him or her to recite the Muslim declaration of belief, the Shahada. \\"When they get to the execution area, their strength drains away. Then I read the execution order, and at a signal I cut the prisoner's head off,\\" he said. Capital offences Deera Square, central Riyadh. Known locally as \\"Chop-chop square\\", it is the location of public beheadings. Saudi law theoretically allows the death penalty for a variety of crimes: * Apostasy * Treason * Homosexuality * Espionage * Murder * Rape * Terrorism * Drug smuggling * Armed robbery * Blasphemy * Burglary if aggravated circumstances, including recidivism * Adultery (unmarried adulterers can be sentenced to 100 lashes, married ones can be sentenced to stoning.)Penalty for adultery:  Sorcery or witchcraftBBC News, \\"Pleas for condemned Saudi 'witch'\\", 14 February 2008 BBC NEWS * Waging war on GodSafia Safwat, Offences and Penalties in Islamic Law, 26 ISLAMIC Q., 1982, p.296 =Murder= Murder is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. If a murderer pays a family of the victim blood money, and the family approves of the choice, the murderer will not be executed. The criminal justice system waits until the family makes a decision on whether the family of the victim will accept blood moneyMackey, p. 270. or if the family of the victim will choose to have the murderer executed, or to completely forgive the perpetrator. =Other offences= Sharia background The Saudi judiciary can impose the death penalty according to three categories of criminal offence in Sharia law: *Hudud: Fixed Quranic punishments for specific crimes. Hudud crimes which can result in the death penalty include apostasy, adultery, and sodomy. *Qisas: Eye-for-an-eye retaliatory punishments. Qisas crimes include murder. Families of someone murdered can choose between demanding the death penalty or granting clemency in return for a payment of diyya, or blood money, by the perpetrator. A trend has developed of exorbitant blood-money demands: a recent report mentions a sum of $11 million demanded in exchange for clemency. *Tazir: A general category, including crimes defined by national regulations, some of which can be punished by death, such as drug trafficking. A conviction requires proof in one of three ways: # An uncoerced confession. # The testimony of two male witnesses can result in conviction. This excludes \\"hudud crimes\\", in which case a confession is also required. # An affirmation or denial by oath can be required. Giving an oath is taken particularly seriously in a religious society such as Saudi Arabia's, and a refusal to take an oath will be taken as an admission of guilt resulting in conviction. Adultery In order for an individual to be convicted in a Saudi sharia law court of adultery, he/she must confess to the act four times in front of the court; otherwise four pious male Muslims or two pious men and two women who witnessed the actual sexual penetration must testify in front of the court. If the witnesses were spying on the defendants or intentionally watched the defendants commit adultery, their uprightness would be called into question and a conviction for adultery would not take place. According to the Islamic sharia law, the burden of proof is on the accuser; and if only one of those witnesses retracted his/her testimony then the accused will be acquitted and the remaining witnesses will be prosecuted for perjury Quran 24:4. The execution method for adultery committed by married men and women is stoning (see Capital offences). If the conviction was established through confession, a retraction of the confession or the defendant leaving the pit while stoning is taking place results in the penalty being stayed. If the conviction was established through the testimony of four witnesses, the witnesses must initiate the stoning, and failure to do so results in the execution being stayed. Sandra Mackey, author of The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom, stated in 1987 that in Saudi Arabia, \\"unlike the tribal rights of a father to put to death a daughter who has violated her chastity, death sentences under Qur'anic law [for adultery] are extremely rare.\\"Mackey, p. 271. Mackey explained that \\"[c]harges of adultery are never made lightly. Since the penalty is so severe, women are protected from unfounded accusations of sexual misconduct\\". During a human rights dialogue with European jurists that took place several years before 1987, a Saudi delegate acknowledged that it is difficult to have a person convicted of adultery. According to Mackey, in a 20-year period ending in 1987, one woman \\"is acknowledged to\\" have been executed by stoning for adultery. Princess Misha'al was shot several times in the head for adultery in 1977. Witchcraft Muree bin Ali bin Issa al-Asiri, who was found in possession of talismans, was executed in the southern Najran province in June 2012. A Saudi woman, Amina bin Salem Nasser, was executed for being convicted of practicing sorcery and witchcraft in December 2011 in the northern province of Jawf, and a Sudanese man (Abdul Hamid Bin Hussain Bin Moustafa al-Fakki) was executed in a car park in Medina for the same reason in September 20, 2011. In 2014, Mohammed bin Bakr al-Alawi was beheaded on 5 August for allegedly practicing black magic and sorcery.  Mass executions  On 2 January 2016, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia carried out a mass execution of 47 imprisoned civilians convicted for terrorism in 12 different provinces in the country. Forty-three were beheaded and four were executed by firing squads. Among the 47 people killed was Shia Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr.Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr: Saudi Arabia executes top Shia cleric, BBC News (January 2, 2016). The execution was the largest carried out in the kingdom since 1980. On April 23, 2019, the Saudi Interior Ministry stated that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia carried out a mass execution of 37 imprisoned civilians who had been convicted, mostly on the basis of confessions obtained under torture or written by the accused's torturers, for terrorism-related allegations in 6 provinces in the country. Fourteen of the people executed had been convicted in relation to their participation in the 2011‚Äì12 Saudi Arabian protests in Qatif, mostly on the basis of torture-induced confessions. The executions were carried out by beheading, and two of the bodies were publicly hung from a pole. According to Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry the convicts were all Saudi nationals. Thirty two of those executed belonged to the country's Shia minority. One of the thirty-two, Abdulkareem al-Hawaj, was 16 years old at the time of his alleged crime; executions for crimes committed by those under 18 are violations of international law. According to Reprieve, two others were also under 18 at the time of their alleged crimes, Mujtaba al-Sweikat and Salman Qureish. The bodies of at least 33 out of these 37 people executed were not handed back to their respective families. The Saudi government did not publicly explain the reason behind it, and did not hand back the corpses of those executed, as of April 8, 2020. Criticism The use of public beheading as the methods of capital punishment and the number of executions have attracted strong international criticism. Several executions, particularly of foreign workers have sparked international outcries. In June 2011, Ruyati binti Satubi, an Indonesian maid, was beheaded for killing her employer's wife, reportedly after years of abuse. A video of the execution, posted online, drew extensive criticism. In September 2011, a Sudanese migrant worker was beheaded for sorcery, an execution which Amnesty International condemned as \\"appalling\\". In January 2013 a Sri Lankan maid named Rizana Nafeek was beheaded after she was convicted of murdering a child under her care, an occurrence which she attributed to the infant choking. The execution drew international condemnation of the government's practises, and led Sri Lanka to recall its ambassador. These are not isolated cases. According to figures by Amnesty International, in 2010 at least 27 migrant workers were executed and, , more than 45 foreign maids were on death row awaiting execution. In practice, the death penalty has also been used to sentence political protestors. Ali al-Nimr and Dawoud al-Marhoon were both arrested at the age of 17 in 2012 during Arab Spring protests in the Eastern Province, tortured, forced to confess, and sentenced to decapitation in 2014 and 2015. Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, an independent sheikh critical of the Saudi government and popular among youth and Ali al-Nimr's uncle, was also arrested in 2012 and sentenced to death by the Specialized Criminal Court in 2014 for his role in encouraging political protests. Nimr al-Nimr was executed on January 2, 2016, along with 46 other people, mostly terrorists arrested in the 2000s. From the available sources about Nimr al-Nimr case it seems that Saudi officials use the term \\"terrorism\\" as cover label for \\"thought crimes\\" which would be in other countries considered as normal work of an opposition politician. There has never been a credible report of a European national being executed judicially in Saudi Arabia.

The name upside- down catfish is most commonly used by aquarists to refer to the mochokid catfish Synodontis nigriventris alternately known to ichthyologists as the blotched upside-down catfish or false upside-down catfish. However, a number of other fish may also be known by this name: *Mystus leucophasis ‚Äì Asian upside-down catfish *Synodontis angelicus ‚Äì spotted upside-down catfish *Synodontis aterrima ‚Äì sometimes sold as S. nigriventris in the aquarium trade, but in the past not identified as a separate species by retailers *Synodontis batensoda=Brachysynodontis batensoda ‚Äì known as giant upside-down catfish, or squeaker.

In the aquarium trade, the name is almost always applied to S. nigriventris or species with which it may be confused, such as S. aterrima, S. contracta, and juvenile S. nigrita (adults of which are around 20 cm so are not \\"dwarf\\" species at all). As its common name implies, the upside-down catfish will swim upside-down. One theory accounts for this unusual behavior as a feeding strategy. In the wild, it often grazes on the undersides of submerged branches and logs, and swimming upside-down makes these areas more accessible. A different theory suggests swimming upside-down makes aquatic surface respiration more efficient.

It is a AAA Four-Diamond Hotel and has been since 2001\\\\. It has been visited by many Presidents of the United States and many other notable personages. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the hotel is an example of the Arts and Crafts style. It also features a $44 million, , modern subterranean spa, which placed number 13 worldwide in Travel + Leisure's World's Best Hotel Spas in 2008. The Grove Park Inn is a member of the Historic Hotel of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The Grove Park Inn also provides guests with an 18-hole golf course routed on the hill below the hotel. Donald Ross (who designed Pinehurst Resort) designed the original course. History The Grove Park Inn was conceptualized by Edwin Wiley Grove (1850‚Äì1927) with the help of his son- in-law Fred Loring Seely (1871‚Äì1942). Edwin Wiley Grove, known as the \\"Father of Modern Asheville\\", was born in 1850 on a small farm in Tennessee. After serving in the Civil War, he had a very definite plan for his life and career ‚Äì the pharmaceutical business and the determination to rise from his early poverty to great wealth and success. While in his mid-20s, Grove purchased Paris Medicine Company. Originally based in Paris, Tennessee, the firm was moved to St. Louis. Its primary money-making product was Grove's Chill Tonic, which was a syrup elixir containing quinine. This formula helped tame the raging chills brought on by malaria. While still pursuing new pharmaceutical inventions, Grove met Fred Seely in Detroit, who was making a name for himself in the pharmaceutical business. While working together in Detroit, the two sparked a friendship and mutual admiration. Grove invited Seely to his summer home in Asheville. One week later, he left his position in Detroit to work for Grove and his Paris Medicine Company, but business was not the only thing that interested Seely. When Grove introduced his daughter, Evelyn, to the bachelor, within 24 hours, Grove had given Seely permission to wed her. Seely was married to Evelyn Grove (1877-1953), Edwin's daughter with his first wife Mary Louisa (Lou) Moore Grove. Lou died in 1878 when her daughter, Evelyn, was only one year old. Grove's second wife, Gertrude, was to bear Mr. Grove a son, known as Eddie. After Grove died on January 27, 1927, his second wife and Eddie and Evelyn inherited the income from a trust Mr. Grove had set up. Gertrude sued for widow's rights and busted the trust, but then died in 1928, which allowed Eddie to inherit his mother's share of the Grove fortune. Eddie died six years later in 1934. Most of the fortune was exhausted according to historian Bruce Johnson. In the late 1890s, Grove's Tasteless Chill Tonic, which had become a household staple, sold more bottles than Coca-Cola. After 20 years on the market, Grove has sold over 1.5 million bottles of his tonic and surpassed his dreams by making millions of dollars. Edwin believed the Asheville, North Carolina climate would have health benefits and be the ideal location for a resort. His doctors sent him there to determine if the climate would help reduce or cure his bouts with extreme hiccups, which would last several weeks at a time. E. W. Grove began to accumulate the land for the inn and his Grove Park-Kimberly Avenue developments in 1910. He bought several farms and sloped areas all the way to the top of Sunset Mountain. Grove bought and demolished several TB sanitariums in his zeal to change the face of Asheville. Construction began in 1912 and was completed in 11 months and 27 days. This was accomplished by paying high wages to the dedicated workers. Circus tents were erected on the job site to house the workers. Just three days shy of one year, the Grove Park Inn opened on July 12, 1913. Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan delivered the keynote address to 400 of the most distinguished men of the South, gathered for the opening banquet. He had no idea of how true his words would become when he proclaimed that the Grove Park Inn \\"was built for the ages.\\" The hotel was outfitted with furnishings from the Roycrofters of East Aurora, New York, one of the most important designers and manufacturers of Arts and Crafts furniture, metal work, and other accessories. The hotel was built of rough granite stones and the expansive lobby is noted for its enormous granite fireplaces and expansive porch with its scenic overlook. It was advertised as having \\"walls five feet thick of granite boulders\\". Four hundred men worked 10-hour shifts six days a week. With the work of mules, wagons, and ropes, and a lone steam shovel, granite boulders, some weighing as much as 10,000 pounds, were hauled from Sunset Mountain to build the hotel. Seely kept his promise to be open for business in less than one year from the ground breaking. Fred Seely, 1912 During World War II, the Inn was used first as an internment center for Axis diplomats. The diplomats and their staff were allowed guarded trips to town, where they would purchase goods from the local merchants. This was a boon to the strapped local economy. The inn was then used by the Navy as a rest and rehabilitation center for returning sailors. In 1944‚Äì45, the hotel was an Army Redistribution Station where soldiers rested and relaxed before being assigned to other duties. The Philippine government functioned in exile from the Presidential Cottage on the grounds during the war. The Grove Park Inn became part of Sammons Enterprises in 1955. The resort has been expanded over the years under the direction of the owners Mr. and Mrs. Sammons and continues to be a popular tourist attraction. Mrs. Sammons would bring her dog in under cover in a baby carriage. Mrs. Sammons died in 2008. KSL Resorts acquired the Grove Park Inn in 2012 for $120 million. They sold it to Omni Hotels in 2013, and it was renamed the Omni Grove Park Inn.http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/06/12/2959057/texas-based-omni-hotels- acquires.html Grove Park and Biltmore Relationship In 1917, just four years after the completion of the construction of the Grove Park Inn, Fred Seely purchased Biltmore Estate Industries from Edith Vanderbilt, wife of George Washington Vanderbilt II, the owner of the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina. This new venture came in addition to his responsibilities as the manager of the Grove Park Inn. E.W. Grove, his father- in-law and owner of the Grove Park Inn, had refused to sell the hotel to Seely, though he had eagerly allowed him to construct the building. He instead leased the hotel to Seely to manage and Seely managed the hotel until 1927, the year of Grove's death and the year Seely lost his legal bid to own the hotel. Grove left his hotel to his wife and son and daughter. Though Seely was married to his daughter, Grove made no concessions to Seely and the inn passed into the hands of what one advertisement described as \\"more liberal management.\\" An interesting annotation by Seely scribbled next to the advertisement found in his files takes issue with that characterization. Presidential visits Ten Presidents have stayed at the hotel: * William Howard Taft ‚Äì 27th President of the United States, stayed in 1929 and 1930 * Woodrow Wilson ‚Äì 28th President of the United States * Calvin Coolidge ‚Äì 30th President of the United States * Herbert Hoover ‚Äì 31st President of the United States * Franklin D.

The rooms in which he stayed, 441 and 443, are available for guests. One is furnished exactly as it was during his stay in the 1930s. His typewriter is on display in the Vanderbilt wing. Rooms in which famous people stayed are marked by plaques on the door saying who stayed there and when. On February 3, 1930, William Howard Taft resigned from the U.S. Supreme Court in the Great Hall lobby. He died a month later. In 1999, gospel artist Bill Gaither recorded \\"Mountain Homecoming\\" in his series of Gaither Homecoming videos and CDs in the Great Hall lobby, including artists Gloria Gaither, Mark Lowry, Larry Gatlin, the Bishops, Stephen Hill, Joy Gardner, and Ben Isaacs. In 1920, a guest dubbed The Pink Lady died in a fall to the Palm Court from the balcony in the old middle part of the Inn (the floors above the main lobby). Her room number was 545. Literary references In Lee Smith's Guests on Earth: A Novel (which is about Zelda Fitzgerald and published in 2013), the central character often makes references to the Omni Grove Inn as the novel takes place in Asheville, North Carolina. In Cormac McCarthy's 1979 novel Suttree (set in Knoxville), the title character and his girlfriend spend four days at the inn, staying in what McCarthy described as \\"a cool room high in the old rough pile of rocks.\\"Cormac McCarthy, Suttree (Vintage, 1992), p. 407.

Muckross House Major Henry Arthur Herbert (1840 ‚Äì 14 August 1901), was an Irish landowner and a politician in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Background He was the son of Henry Arthur Herbert (1815‚Äì1866), and his wife the Scottish watercolourist Mary Balfour Herbert. His great-grandfather was Henry Arthur Herbert (1756‚Äì1821), MP for Kerry from 1806‚Äì1813, He inherited his father's Muckross House and estate, near Killarney. In the 1870s this estate amounted to over 47,000 acres in County Kerry. Under Henry Arthur Herbert's reign the fortunes of the Muckross estate declined until it became insolvent in 1897. A year later, the estate was forfeited to the Standard Life Assurance Company and the long association of the Herbert family with Muckross House was ended. After the auction of the property in November 1899 had failed, it was bought a week later by Arthur Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun. At that time Henry Arthur Herbert suffered from Parkinson's disease and was living in the home of his doctor in Watford (Hertfordshire), where he died in August 1901. He is buried in the Killegy graveyard near Muckross House. Public career Henry Arthur Herbert was a JP and Deputy Lieutenant for Kerry. He sat in Parliament as Member of Parliament (MP) for County Kerry from 1866 until 1880. He was appointed High Sheriff of Kerry in 1881. He was a major in the London Irish Rifles and a captain in the Coldstream Guards. Family Shortly after his father's death, Henry Arthur Herbert married the Hon. Emily Julia Charlotte Keane (*12 Jan 1848, ‚Ä†2 Jul 1911) from County Waterford, the daughter of Edward Arthur Wellington Keane, 2nd Baron Keane, and Louisa Caroline Lydia Benyon. He petitioned for divorce (The Times, 29 April 1882) on the grounds of his wife's adultery with Charles B. Greenfield, and the couple were divorced in the early 1880s. Neither party remarried. They had three children, Henry Arthur Edward Keane Herbert (1867-1931), Kathleen Keane Herbert (1868-) and Gladys Keane Herbert (1873-).

The enterprise proved a success and, by 1677, Constantine had been able to move his premises to a more central location in Devereux Court, off Fleet Street. In the 1690s, the Grecian Coffee House was the favoured meeting place of the opposition Whigs, a group that included John Trenchard, Andrew Fletcher and Matthew Tindal. In the early years of the eighteenth century, it was frequented by members of the Royal Society, including Sir Isaac Newton, Sir Hans Sloane, Edmund Halley and James Douglas, and the poet and statesman, Joseph Addison. Classical scholars were also said to congregate there and on one occasion two of them fought a duel in the street outside because they fell out over where to position the accent on an Ancient Greek word. In the 1760s and 1770s it was a favourite haunt of Irish law students, especially \\"the Templers\\", those young Irishmen who were studying at the Middle Temple. They were attracted there by the presence of the poet and playwright Oliver Goldsmith, who \\"delighted to entertain his friends there\\". These friends included the future staesman Henry Grattan.Kenny, Colum \\"King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland\\" Irish Academic Press 1992 The Grecian was the favourite coffee-house in London of the renowned Shakespearean scholar Edmond Malone. In April 1776 he wrote his father a letter from there, boasting \\"I am at present writing in a coffee- house, in the midst of so much noise and bustle‚Äîthe celebrated anti-Sejanus (Mr. Scott) on one side and Mr. [Charles] Macklin [the actor] on the other‚Äîthat I can't add anything more at present.\\" By 1803, the Grecian was no longer the meeting place of radicals, scholars and scientists but of lawyers and it finally closed in 1843, becoming a pub. The site is now occupied by The Devereux public house, and is a Grade II listed building.

These theories were developed from the 16th until the 19th century in connection with the aether. However, such models are no longer regarded as viable theories within the mainstream scientific community and general relativity is now the standard model to describe gravitation without the use of actions at a distance. Modern \\"quantum gravity\\" hypotheses also attempt to describe gravity by more fundamental processes such as particle fields, but they are not based on classical mechanics.  Screening  This theory is probablyTaylor (1876), Peck (1903), secondary sources the best-known mechanical explanation, and was developed for the first time by Nicolas Fatio de Duillier in 1690, and re-invented, among others, by Georges-Louis Le Sage (1748), Lord Kelvin (1872), and Hendrik Lorentz (1900), and criticized by James Clerk Maxwell (1875), and Henri Poincar√© (1908). The theory posits that the force of gravity is the result of tiny particles or waves moving at high speed in all directions, throughout the universe. The intensity of the flux of particles is assumed to be the same in all directions, so an isolated object A is struck equally from all sides, resulting in only an inward-directed pressure but no net directional force. With a second object B present, however, a fraction of the particles that would otherwise have struck A from the direction of B is intercepted, so B works as a shield, so-to-speak‚Äîthat is, from the direction of B, A will be struck by fewer particles than from the opposite direction. Likewise, B will be struck by fewer particles from the direction of A than from the opposite direction. One can say that A and B are \\"shadowing\\" each other, and the two bodies are pushed toward each other by the resulting imbalance of forces. P5: Permeability, attenuation and mass proportionality This shadow obeys the inverse square law, because the imbalance of momentum flow over an entire spherical surface enclosing the object is independent of the size of the enclosing sphere, whereas the surface area of the sphere increases in proportion to the square of the radius. To satisfy the need for mass proportionality, the theory posits that a) the basic elements of matter are very small so that gross matter consists mostly of empty space, and b) that the particles are so small, that only a small fraction of them would be intercepted by gross matter. The result is, that the \\"shadow\\" of each body is proportional to the surface of every single element of matter. Criticism: This theory was declined primarily for thermodynamic reasons because a shadow only appears in this model if the particles or waves are at least partly absorbed, which should lead to an enormous heating of the bodies. Also drag, i.e. the resistance of the particle streams in the direction of motion, is a great problem too. This problem can be solved by assuming superluminal speeds, but this solution largely increases the thermal problems and contradicts special relativity.Poincar√© (1908), Secondary sourcesMaxwell (1875, Atom), Secondary sources  Vortex  Aether vortices around celestial bodies Because of his philosophical beliefs, Ren√© Descartes proposed in 1644 that no empty space can exist and that space must consequently be filled with matter. The parts of this matter tend to move in straight paths, but because they lie close together, they can not move freely, which according to Descartes implies that every motion is circular, so the aether is filled with vortices. Descartes also distinguishes between different forms and sizes of matter in which rough matter resists the circular movement more strongly than fine matter. Due to centrifugal force, matter tends towards the outer edges of the vortex, which causes a condensation of this matter there. The rough matter cannot follow this movement due to its greater inertia‚Äîso due to the pressure of the condensed outer matter those parts will be pushed into the center of the vortex. According to Descartes, this inward pressure is nothing other than gravity. He compared this mechanism with the fact that if a rotating, liquid filled vessel is stopped, the liquid goes on to rotate. Now, if one drops small pieces of light matter (e.g. wood) into the vessel, the pieces move to the middle of the vessel.Descartes, 1644; Zehe, 1980, pp. 65‚Äì70; Van Lunteren, p. 47Zehe (1980), Secondary sources Following the basic premises of Descartes, Christiaan Huygens between 1669 and 1690 designed a much more exact vortex model. This model was the first theory of gravitation which was worked out mathematically. He assumed that the aether particles are moving in every direction, but were thrown back at the outer borders of the vortex and this causes (as in the case of Descartes) a greater concentration of fine matter at the outer borders. So also in his model the fine matter presses the rough matter into the center of the vortex. Huygens also found out that the centrifugal force is equal to the force, which acts in the direction of the center of the vortex (centripetal force). He also posited that bodies must consist mostly of empty space so that the aether can penetrate the bodies easily, which is necessary for mass proportionality. He further concluded that the aether moves much faster than the falling bodies. At this time, Newton developed his theory of gravitation which is based on attraction, and although Huygens agreed with the mathematical formalism, he said the model was insufficient due to the lack of a mechanical explanation of the force law. Newton's discovery that gravity obeys the inverse square law surprised Huygens and he tried to take this into account by assuming that the speed of the aether is smaller in greater distance.Van Lunteren (2002), Secondary sources Criticism: Newton objected to the theory because drag must lead to noticeable deviations of the orbits which were not observed. Another problem was that moons often move in different directions, against the direction of the vortex motion. Also, Huygens' explanation of the inverse square law is circular, because this means that the aether obeys Kepler's third law. But a theory of gravitation has to explain those laws and must not presuppose them. Several British physicists developed vortex atom theory in the late nineteenth century. However, the physicist, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, developed a quite distinct approach. Whereas Descartes had outlined three species of matter ‚Äì each linked respectively to the emission, transmission, and reflection of light ‚Äì Thomson developed a theory based on a unitary continuum.  Streams  In a 1675 letter to Henry Oldenburg, and later to Robert Boyle, Newton wrote the following: [Gravity is the result of] ‚Äúa condensation causing a flow of ether with a corresponding thinning of the ether density associated with the increased velocity of flow.‚Äù He also asserted that such a process was consistent with all his other work and Kepler's Laws of Motion.I. Newton, letters quoted in detail in The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science by Edwin Arthur Burtt, Double day Anchor Books. Newtons' idea of a pressure drop associated with increased velocity of flow was mathematically formalised as Bernoulli's principle published in Daniel Bernoulli's book Hydrodynamica in 1738. However, although he later proposed a second explanation (see section below), Newton's comments to that question remained ambiguous. In the third letter to Bentley in 1692 he wrote:http://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/THEM00258 Newton, 1692, 4th letter to Bentley > It is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without the > mediation of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect > other matter, without mutual contact, as it must do if gravitation in the > sense of Epicurus be essential and inherent in it.

On the other hand, Newton is also well known for the phrase Hypotheses non fingo, written in 1713:Isaac Newton (1726). Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, General Scholium. Third edition, page 943 of I. Bernard Cohen and Anne Whitman's 1999 translation, University of California Press , 974 pages. > I have not as yet been able to discover the reason for these properties of > gravity from phenomena, and I do not feign hypotheses.

In this philosophy > particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards > rendered general by induction. And according to the testimony of some of his friends, such as Nicolas Fatio de Duillier or David Gregory, Newton thought that gravitation is based directly on divine influence. Similar to Newton, but mathematically in greater detail, Bernhard Riemann assumed in 1853 that the gravitational aether is an incompressible fluid and normal matter represents sinks in this aether. So if the aether is destroyed or absorbed proportionally to the masses within the bodies, a stream arises and carries all surrounding bodies into the direction of the central mass. Riemann speculated that the absorbed aether is transferred into another world or dimension. Another attempt to solve the energy problem was made by Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky in 1888. Based on his aether stream model, which was similar to that of Riemann, he argued that the absorbed aether might be converted into new matter, leading to a mass increase of the celestial bodies. Criticism: As in the case of Le Sage's theory, the disappearance of energy without explanation violates the energy conservation law. Also some drag must arise, and no process which leads to a creation of matter is known.  Static pressure  Newton updated the second edition of Optics (1717) with another mechanical-ether theory of gravity. Unlike his first explanation (1675 - see Streams), he proposed a stationary aether which gets thinner and thinner nearby the celestial bodies. On the analogy of the lift, a force arises, which pushes all bodies to the central mass. He minimized drag by stating an extremely low density of the gravitational aether. Like Newton, Leonhard Euler presupposed in 1760 that the gravitational aether loses density in accordance with the inverse square law. Similarly to others, Euler also assumed that to maintain mass proportionality, matter consists mostly of empty space. Criticism: Both Newton and Euler gave no reason why the density of that static aether should change. Furthermore, James Clerk Maxwell pointed out that in this \\"hydrostatic\\" model \\"the state of stress... which we must suppose to exist in the invisible medium, is 3000 times greater than that which the strongest steel could support\\".Maxwell (1875, Attraction), Secondary sources  Waves  Robert Hooke speculated in 1671 that gravitation is the result of all bodies emitting waves in all directions through the aether. Other bodies, which interact with these waves, move in the direction of the source of the waves. Hooke saw an analogy to the fact that small objects on a disturbed surface of water move to the center of the disturbance.Taylor (1876), Secondary sources A similar theory was worked out mathematically by James Challis from 1859 to 1876. He calculated that the case of attraction occurs if the wavelength is large in comparison with the distance between the gravitating bodies. If the wavelength is small, the bodies repel each other. By a combination of these effects, he also tried to explain all other forces. Criticism: Maxwell objected that this theory requires a steady production of waves, which must be accompanied by an infinite consumption of energy.Maxwell (1875), Secondary sources Challis himself admitted, that he hadn't reached a definite result due to the complexity of the processes.  Pulsation  Lord Kelvin (1871) and Carl Anton Bjerknes (1871) assumed that all bodies pulsate in the aether. This was in analogy to the fact that, if the pulsation of two spheres in a fluid is in phase, they will attract each other; and if the pulsation of two spheres is not in phase, they will repel each other. This mechanism was also used for explaining the nature of electric charges. Among others, this hypothesis has also been examined by George Gabriel Stokes and Woldemar Voigt.Zenneck (1903), Secondary sources Criticism : To explain universal gravitation, one is forced to assume that all pulsations in the universe are in phase‚Äîwhich appears very implausible. In addition, the aether should be incompressible to ensure that attraction also arises at greater distances. And Maxwell argued that this process must be accompanied by a permanent new production and destruction of aether.  Other historical speculations  In 1690, Pierre Varignon assumed that all bodies are exposed to pushes by aether particles from all directions, and that there is some sort of limitation at a certain distance from the Earth's surface which cannot be passed by the particles. He assumed that if a body is closer to the Earth than to the limitation boundary, then the body would experience a greater push from above than from below, causing it to fall toward the Earth. In 1748, Mikhail Lomonosov assumed that the effect of the aether is proportional to the complete surface of the elementary components of which matter consists (similar to Huygens and Fatio before him). He also assumed an enormous penetrability of the bodies. However, no clear description was given by him as to how exactly the aether interacts with matter so that the law of gravitation arises. In 1821, John Herapath tried to apply his co- developed model of the kinetic theory of gases on gravitation. He assumed that the aether is heated by the bodies and loses density so that other bodies are pushed to these regions of lower density. However, it was shown by Taylor that the decreased density due to thermal expansion is compensated for by the increased speed of the heated particles; therefore, no attraction arises. Recent theorizing These mechanical explanations for gravity never gained widespread acceptance, although such ideas continued to be studied occasionally by physicists until the beginning of the twentieth century, by which time it was generally considered to be conclusively discredited. However, some researchers outside the scientific mainstream still try to work out some consequences of those theories. Le Sage's theory was studied by Radzievskii and Kagalnikova (1960), A rough English translation appeared in a U.S. government technical report: FTD TT64 323; TT 64 11801 (1964), Foreign Tech. Div., Air Force Systems Command, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio (reprinted in Pushing Gravity) Shneiderov (1961), Buonomano and Engels (1976), Adamut (1982), Jaakkola (1996), Tom Van Flandern (1999), and Edwards (2007). A variety of Le Sage models and related topics are discussed in Edwards, et al. Gravity due to static pressure was recently studied by Arminjon.

It is governed by the Ministry of Culture. The goals of the agency are to encourage the preservation and protection of historic environments and to promote the respect for and knowledge of historic environments. In order to do this, it tries to ensure that Swedish heritage is accessible to all citizens, to spread information about that heritage, and to \\"empower heritage as a force in the evolution of a democratic, sustainable society\\".  History  = 17th and 18th century = The National Heritage Board was founded in 1630. On the 20May that year, Johannes Bureus who was a prominent rune researcher and King Gustavus Adolphus' private teacher, was appointed the first riksantikvarien (\\"National Antiquarian\\"). Bureus' teachings had made the king interested in ancient monuments and national heritage sites and artifacts, at that time called \\"antiquities\\". Together with a priest and a young student, Bureus went on a journey through Sweden to draw and document runestones, collect old coins, chronicles, law books, letter and manuscripts. In 1666, Johan Hadorph the seventh National Antiquarian, established the Placat och P√•budh, Om Gamble Monumenter och Antiquiteter (\\"Signs and Decrees, of Old Monuments and Antiquities\\"), Sweden's first draft for an Antiquities Act. Aside from laws of the Vatican City, it was the first antiquities regulation in Europe. The decree made it possible to protect ancient monuments and sites from treasure hunters and vandalism, such as people who wanted to use ancient tumuli as brick kilns. Public interest in ancient monuments and their protection subsided after the time of the Swedish Empire in the 1720s. In 1780, most of the museum collections owned by the government were handed over to the National Library and the National Archives. In 1768, the remainder of the objects were placed in the care of the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities, with the National Antiquarian as the academy's secretary. = 19th and the early 20th century = Charles XIV John's monogram on the National Heritage Board's head office building. During the 18th century, there was a new interest in natural science as well as Neoclassicism and the study of \\"antiquities\\" was looked upon as somewhat dated. Some renewal of the studies was brought about when Johan Gustaf Liljegren became National Antiquarian in 1826. Among the projects he started was an organized inventory of objects and sites and archaeological excavations were done at Birka and Visby. A new antiquities regulation was also created in 1867. It stated that any violation of an ancient monument was a criminal offence. While the Heritage Board's collection of historical objects was still in Stockholm, several additional positions within the area of heritage preservation were instituted during the 20th century. Sigurd Curman (NA from 1923) created a central head agency with a number of County Antiquarians to head all the county museums in Sweden. The County Antiquarians also coordinated their work with the National Heritage Board, which function as an independent government agency since 1938. = Second half of the 20th century = Part of the museum collections are today under the Statens historiska museer (SHMM) (\\"National Historical Museums\\"), the history of which is closely linked with that of the National Heritage Board. The Antikvarisk- topografiska arkivet (ATA) (\\"Antiquarian Topographic Archive\\") and the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities' Library are also part of the National Heritage Board. These departments are housed in the Eastern Stable opposite the main office building in Stockholm. The functions of the Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities and the National Heritage Board were separated in 1975 while they were still under the aegis under the newly formed government agency the \\"National Heritage Board and National Historical Museums\\". These were separated into two agencies, the National Heritage Board and the National Historical Museums, in 1998. = 21st century = The inner courtyard of the National Heritage Board's building in Visby On 2June 2005, the government decided to relocate a major part of the National Heritage Board's activities from Stockholm to Gotland. The move was made to compensate for the loss of jobs on the island when the Swedish military closed down all permanent garrisons there. The National Heritage Board moved to the newly built facilities at the old A7 military compound in Visby, in 2008. Since 2007, the facilities also housed the Swedish Exhibition Agency. The move to Gotland was questioned by several officials within the agency who believed that the government did not understand how the National Heritage Board worked. Large parts of the operation are still remaining in Stockholm. Since 2012, this includes the main office in the Mounted Royal Guard's old caserns at the History Museum in √ñstermalm. Under the open area between the museum's main building and the Eastern Stable are storage rooms where the archive and library collections are kept. Glimmingehus Since 2015, the agency has operations in Stockholm, Visby and Tumba (Swedish Museum Services). It also has functions at the Old Uppsala Museum and Glimmingehus.  Earlier functions  The agency was previously tasked with archaeological commission operations. This was Sweden's largest archaeological operations organization with several regional offices, among those in Stockholm, Link√∂ping, Gothenburg and Lund. On 1January 2015, the archaeological operations were transferred to the National Historical Museums. The National Heritage Board's previous double functions - as government agency and outsourcer - had been questioned as early as in the 1980s. The National Heritage Board's Gotland Studies (Riksantikvarie√§mbetets Gotlandsunders√∂kningar) (RAGU), were previously a regional office under the archaeological commission operations during the 1970s to 1980s. Since 2015, this is under the aegis of the Gotland Museum.  Internet activities  = Platsr = The agency run the Internet network Platsr, a site where individuals and organizations can write texts about events and memories connected to local history. Pictures, short films and locations on a map can be added to the texts. All material on Platsr is published under different versions of Creative Commons licenses. In March 2016, stories from approximately 3,300 locations had been written by a little more than 1,800 individuals, heritage societies, archives, museums and libraries. Platsr was created in 2009, at the request of the Swedish government. The idea was to promote a more democratic historiography and to participate in this online. = Social media and wikipedia = The National Heritage Board also use social media for its operation. The agency has a Facebook account and since 2009, it has used Flickr to publish archived material. In 2012, the agency started a collaboration with wikipedia. Experienced Wikikpedia editors already worked for the agency in both Stockholm and Visby, and the goal of the collaboration was partly to improve the encyclopedia and partly to link wikipedia to content in the agency's internal databases. = Forns√∂k = The agency also has an internet site called Forns√∂k, for searching its archives on archaeological and historical sites and buildings.  National Antiquarians  Johannes Bureus, the first National Antiquarian (1630‚Äì48) The highest executive director at the National Heritage Board holds the title riksantikvarie (\\"National Antiquarian\\"). The title corresponds with Director-general in other government agencies. The office was instituted on 20May 1630 by King Gustavus Adolphus. Since then, 31 persons have held the position.

Life Gehre was born in D√ºsseldorf, Germany. Little detail is known of his early years in the parental home and the education he received. The first reference to Gehre appears when he was a managing director of a building contractor. In 1928, he published a study on Clausewitz; by that time he is supposed to have begun his career as an officer in the Reichswehr. Contact man with the conspirators At the beginning of the Second World War, Gehre was active as a captain in the Abwehr (military intelligence) under Admiral Wilhelm Canaris. By 1939, a group in the Abwehr had formed to remove the Nazi regime and end the war. This circle included Canaris, General Ludwig Beck, Hans von Dohnanyi, Hans Oster and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, as well as Gehre. By March 1943, Gehre was privy to the preparations under Henning von Tresckow to assassinate Hitler. In January 1944, Helmuth James Graf von Moltke was arrested, and in March 1944 Gehre was also taken by the Gestapo. Gehre, however, was soon able to flee and disappeared. right After the failed 20 July 1944 assassination attempt to kill Hitler, the search for Gehre intensified. Gehre, together with his wife, kept himself hidden for several more weeks. Further shelter was procured by the brothers Hans and Otto John. When Gehre realised that he was about to be discovered by the Gestapo on 2 November, he shot his wife and then directed the gun toward himself. Although he was badly hurt, he survived.An additional installment in Gehre's escape narrative is casually referred to in the judgment represented against the judges of the court martial: On 3 February 1945, the building of the Central Reich Security Office on Prinz-Albrecht-Stra√üe, Berlin was destroyed. Gehre, along with Bonhoeffer, was sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp. From there, he was put onto a transport of SS special detainees and on 5 April incarcerated in the Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp. On 9 April 1945, after an SS flying court- martial, Gehre and Bonhoeffer along with Admiral Canaris, General Oster, General Sack and Captain Theodor Str√ºnck were executed at Flossenb√ºrg by hanging. In 1946, the individuals who had participated in the flying court- martial were brought to justice for murder. However Otto Thorbeck, the presiding officer, was exonerated after appeal.

Breadalbane Academy School Community 1926  HMIE Inspection  In its most recent HMIE inspection the school was graded ‚Äòvery good‚Äô in three out of five categories and ‚Äògood‚Äô in the remaining two. The school was particularly praised for its positive ethos underpinned by excellent staff-pupil relationships. These attributes were again picked up by a recent Nursery inspection (February 2017), which praised the school‚Äôs nurturing environment and quality of leadership. The school was visited by a local authority team in May/June 2018 which also resulted in a very positive report which can be seen on the school website. The school boasts current high levels of attainment, reflected in the school placing within the Sunday Times 2018 top 50 performing state schools in Scotland.  Campus  leftThe current Community Campus opened in December 2010. The school boasts a 25m swimming pool, three outdoor tenis courts, two squash courts, both two-court and four-court indoor areas, a climbing wall, an all-weather astroturf playing surface, a recording studio, a dance studio, and extensive ICT resources which have recently been boosted by considerable investment in hardware and software.  Achievements  165x165px Breadalbane Academy has a strong record in science and technology and pupils in S2 recently won the national Salter Award for Chemistry. The school was also one of three finalists in the Scottish Education Awards STEM category in 2018. The school has also been called a national leader in the development of school based vocational qualifications and was awarded the Scotland-wide LANTRA award for vocational education in 2017. The Rural Skills class has featured on the BBC Beechgrove Garden programme, where the school‚Äôs provision was celebrated as an example of national good practice. The school's Formula 24 team under Physics teacher David Mclean found success in 2017, coming third in the regional heats and qualifying for the international final. The team won best kit car in Scotland.  English Department History  Breadalbane Academy's English department has had a checkered past. In 2009 the school's English department suffered numerous failings which delayed the release of pupils' Higher Prelim results. The department was ultimately reorganized. An independent investigation known as the Jardine Report was conducted. The report concluded that 'mistakes were made on all sides and the rights and expectations of pupils seem to have been lost in the shambolic situation'.https://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/local/perth-kinross/66905/former- breadalbane-academy-teacher-accused-of-prelim-mistakes-faces-disciplinary- hearing/ In subsequent years, and under new school management, the English department has performed well in SQA examinations. In 2016 one of the school's English teachers from 2010 to 2013, Gillian Scott, was judged unfit to teach by the General Teaching Council for Scotland.https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jun/02/english-teacher- gillian-scott-bored-pupils-breadalbane-academy-scotland-general-teaching- council A GTCS Fitness to Teach Panel concluded that throughout her three years at the school, Scott's 'level of teaching deteriorated rather than improved' and that Scott did not show any interest in teaching or improving her teaching skills.General Teaching Council for Scotland Fitness to Teach Panel Outcome registration no. 066852 , p. 49 Among other issues, Scott never learned how to produce a lesson plan,General Teaching Council for Scotland Fitness to Teach Panel Outcome registration no. 066852 , p. 51 instead relying on generic worksheets copied from the Internet,General Teaching Council for Scotland Fitness to Teach Panel Outcome registration no. 066852 , pp. 39-40 gave identical and repetitive work to all pupils regardless of skill, and did not attempt to engage with pupils.General Teaching Council for Scotland Fitness to Teach Panel Outcome registration no. 066852 , pp. 11-12 By 2016 Scott had left Scotland to teach English as a foreign language abroad.General Teaching Council for Scotland Fitness to Teach Panel Outcome registration no. 066852 , p. 49 The verdict of the GTCS panel is disputed.

Background Bred by Pat O'Callaghan, Tony Bin was foaled on 7 April 1983. He was a son of Rathbarry Stud's Kampala and out of the mare Severn Bridge by Hornbeam. The colt was a descendant of the great Nearco through both his sire and his dam. O'Callaghan sold him for 3,000 guineas to the Allevamento White Star breeding and racing operation of Italian businessman Luciano Gaucci. Racing career Tony Bin was trained by Luigi Camici. At age two, his best result in a major race was a third in the GI Gran Criterium at Milan's San Siro Racecourse. As a three-year-old in 1986, he finished second in the GI Gran Premio del Jockey Club. In 1987 at age four, Tony Bin won some of Italy's most prestigious Group One events, including the Gran Premio del Jockey Club, Premio Presidente della Repubblica and Gran Premio di Milano, repeating as winner of the latter two in 1988. Sent to race in France and England, he ran second in the 1988 Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud and third to Mtoto in the 1988 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. In October, he beat Mtoto in France's most prestigious race, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Assessment At the end of the 1988 season, Tony Bin was officially rated the equal of Mtoto as the best older male horse in Europe, one pound behind the filly Miesque. Timeform also could not divide Tony Bin and Mtoto, awarding both horses a rating of 134 and making them the best older horses of either sex, one pound ahead of Miesque and the British filly Indian Skimmer. Stud record Tony Bin was sold for US$4 million to the Zenya Yoshida family of Japan. He stood at stud at their Shadai Stallion Station in Shiraoi, Hokkaido, where he met with considerable success. The leading sire in Japan in 1994, Tony Bin produced progeny that includes: * Air Groove (1993) ‚Äì Horse of the Year and 1997 Champion Older Mare in Japan. In July 2004, her foal (later named The Sunday Fusaichi) by Dance in the Dark sold for ¬•490,000,000 (US$4.54 million), making it the world's highest-priced foal and the most expensive horse ever sold at auction in Japan. * Jungle Pocket (1998) ‚Äì winner of the Tokyo Yushun and Japan Cup, voted the 2001 Japanese Horse of the Year and rated that year by Timeform as the third best three-year-old colt in the world. * Narita Century (1999) ‚Äì Japanese stakes winner of US$2,466,527. * North Flight (1990) ‚Äì winner of Yasuda Kinen and Mile Championship. * Telegnosis (1999) ‚Äì winner of GI NHK Mile Cup with career earnings of more than US$3 million. * Vega (1990) ‚Äì winner of the 1993 Oka Sho (Japanese 1000 Guineas) and Yushun Himba (Japanese Oaks). * Winning Ticket (1990) ‚Äì winner of the 1993 Tokyo Yushun (Japanese Derby).

The Zimmerberg Base Tunnel (LBT) is a railway tunnel under the Zimmerberg mountains in Switzerland. Phase I of the tunnel was opened to traffic during April 2003. The LBT has been divided into two phases of work; as of 2020, only Phase I is operational while Phase II remains in the planning and preparation stages. Zimmerberg I is about 10 km long and links Zurich with Thalwil and bypasses a section of the Lake Z√ºrich left-bank railway line, allowing rail traffic to traverse the mountains more efficiently than traditional routes. Phase I During the 1990s, Switzerland embarked upon a major programme of modernisation and improvements across its railway infrastructure. The NRLA initiative sought to provide better alternatives to the steep mountain railways across Gotthard, Ceneri and L√∂tschberg through the construction of a number of base-level tunnels that enabled trains to more rapidly and efficiently traverse the Swiss Alps. The Zimmerberg Base Tunnel (ZBT) was one such tunnel constructioned under the initiative. Phase I of the Zimmerberg Base Tunnel is a major feature of the route between Zurich and Thalwil. Construction represented a major milestone in Swiss railway infrastructure, the tunnel being the longest double-track tunnel to have been constructed by the nation in excess of 100 years. The tunnel was designed to accommodate high speed transit, with trains traversing at peak speeds of up to 200 km/h. Reportedly, the projected cost of the 10.7 km Phase I section has been calculated at 820 million Swiss francs. During September 1997, construction of the tunnel commenced. The local geography and location of the tunnel posed some challenges to the construction effort, such as the need to avoid impacting nearby urban development, as well as little cover being available at key areas. Boring operations through the rock incorporated both the use of a tunnel boring machine (TBM) along with some conventional techniques, such as blasting, soil injection, and pipe arches amongst other auxiliary construction measures intended to reduce the risk of excessive settlement. Approximately 315 meters of the tunnel's length features a continuous grouted ceiling, which was done to reduce deformation and permeability as well as a potential loss of cover. This was created by injecting a precise mixture of cement and slurry via pressurised grouting pipes across 120,000 valves; areas were tested for potential weaknesses and promptly re-grouted where appropriate. From an early stage of the project, the tunnel's opening was projected for June 2003, a date which was fulfilled on time. Phase II The proposed Phase II of the Zimmerberg Base Tunnel is one element of the wider Rail 2030 programme, which has an overall projected budget of 21 billion Swiss francs. Official project site However, during 2010, it was reported that further work on the project had been put on hold indefinitely. At the time, work was underway on multiple other base tunnels, including the Ceneri Base Tunnel and the Gotthard Base Tunnel. If it is built as per the original plans, Phase II of the tunnel will bring its length to about 20 km, and will link Z√ºrich with Zug. Even following its completion, it is planned to retain the intermediate exit to Thalwil, which would still be used by passenger and freight trains going to Chur as well as by international trains to Austria. Until Phase II is completed, capacity and speeds both remain heavily constrained by traditional routes; the Swiss Federal parliament has voted to include the work in its long term expansion plan for 2030‚Äì2035.

He played as a forward. Career Born in Blackpool, Lancashire, Parkinson, with fifteen goals, he was top scorer for his hometown club in 1896-97, their first-ever season in the Football League; indeed, he played in the club's first Football League game, against Lincoln City on 5 September 1896. He went on to make 365 appearances for the club. He played at either centre-forward or inside-right. Later, he became provider for prolific scorers such as Jack Cox and Bob Birkett. He then switched to a midfield position, and finally centre-half, as the selection committee felt that the modern game was becoming too fast-paced for a veteran forward. In 1899-1900, after Blackpool failed to gain re-election to the League, Parkinson played one game for Liverpool, in the Merseyside derby against Everton at Anfield, but returned to Blackpool a year later when they were permitted back into the League. From then, he was a virtual ever-present until he joined Barrow as manager in 1910. He was the first Blackpool player to score fifty League goals and make 400 appearances. In April 1905, Parkinson was awarded a benefit match against Liverpool. Blackpool F.C. Hall of Fame Parkinson was inducted into the Hall of Fame at Bloomfield Road, when it was officially opened by former Blackpool player Jimmy Armfield in April 2006. Organised by the Blackpool Supporters Association, Blackpool fans around the world voted on their all- time heroes. Five players from each decade are inducted; Parkinson is in the pre-1950s. Personal life Parkinson later became superintendent of Corporation baths in Blackpool's Cocker Street, and lost his life there in an accident on 20 December 1911. He was attempting to rescue a colleague from a tank of boiling seawater when the plank on which he was standing snapped, sending Parkinson into the water as well. He died shortly afterwards, aged 42.

Unlike a magnifying glass, a loupe does not have an attached handle, and its focusing lens(es) are contained in an opaque cylinder or cone or fold into an enclosing housing that protects the lenses when not in use. Loupes are also called hand lenses.  Optics  Diagram of a single lens loupe Three basic types of loupes exist: * Simple lenses, generally used for low-magnification designs because of high optical aberration. * Compound lenses, generally used for higher magnifications to control optical aberration. * Prismatic, multiple lenses with prisms.  Uses  Loupes are used in a number of industries, notably the jewelry trade, watchmaking, photography, printing, dentistry, education and ophthalmology. Loupes are also used in academia and life sciences, such as geology and biology. Amateur naturalists may also find a hand lens or a loupe a useful tool when looking at or identifying species. They are also used in numismatics and stamp collecting. = Jewelers and gemologists = BelOMO 10√ó achromatic triplet jewellers' loupe Jewelers typically use a monocular, handheld loupe in order to magnify gemstones and other jewelry that they wish to inspect.\\"Jewelry - How to Use a Loupe - Using Jewelry Magnifiers\\". Jewelry.About.com A 10√ó magnification is good to use for inspecting jewelry and hallmarks and is the Gemological Institute of America's standard for grading diamond clarity. Stones will sometimes be inspected at higher magnifications than 10√ó, although the depth of field, which is the area in focus, becomes too small to be instructive. The accepted standard for grading diamonds is therefore that inclusions and blemishes visible at 10√ó impact the clarity grade. = Watchmaking = Loupes are employed to assist watchmakers in assembling mechanical watches. Many aspects require the use of the loupe, in particular the assembly of the watch mechanism itself, the assembly and details of the watch dial, as well as the formation of the watch strap and installation of precious stones onto the watch face. Some families like Kruder which were into watchmaking and working with glass started producing high-quality loupes in addition to their watches =Photography= Analog (film) photographers use loupes to review, edit or analyze negatives and slides on a light table. Typical magnifications for viewing slides full-frame depend on image format; 35 mm frames (24√ó36 mm slides to 38√ó38 mm superslides) are best viewed at ca. 5√ó, while ca. 3√ó is optimal for viewing medium format slides (6√ó4.5 cm / 6√ó6 cm / 6√ó7 cm). Often, a 10√ó loupe is used to examine critical sharpness. Photographers using large format cameras also use a loupe to view the ground glass image to aid in focusing. DSLR camera users also use loupes to help to identify dust and other particles on the sensor, in preparation for sensor cleaning. =Printing= Foldable printers, or linen testers Offset and flexographic printing see frequent use of loupes in order to carefully analyze how ink lies on paper. Strippers use loupes in order to register film separations to one another. Pressmen use them to check registration of colors, estimate dot-gain, and diagnose issues with roller pressure and chemistry based on the shape of individual dots and rosettes. =Dentistry= Dental loupes aid dentists, hygienists, and dental therapists to devise accurate diagnoses of oral conditions and enhance surgical precision when completing treatment. Additionally, loupes can improve dentists' posture which can decrease occupational strain. Dental caries, also known as cavities, are most accurately identified by visual and tactile examination of a clean, dry tooth. Magnification enables dentists to improve their ability to differentiate between a stain and a cavity. Cavities are rated and scored based on their visual presentation. If magnification is too high diagnosis becomes difficult due to the small field of view. Ideal magnification for diagnostic purposes is up to 2√ó. Treatment of dental caries, periodontal disease, and pulpal disease are all aided by magnification. The dental specialty of endodontics has performed the vast majority of research regarding magnification in dentistry. Because the identification of accessory canals in addition to the primary pulp canals is essential to complete nonsurgical root canal therapy, magnification provides dentists enhanced visualization to locate and treat more obscured canals. Treatment of periodontal disease is achieved by removing calculus deposits, plaque and therefore bacteria which causes inflammation and subsequently bone destruction. In severe cases, surgery to reduce pocket depth is indicated. Periodontists and hygienists must visualize plaque and calculus to remove it. Magnification can assist dentists and hygienists with identification and removal of plaque and calculus in addition to improving visualization for periodontal surgery. A pair of dental loupes featuring in- lens magnification. There is a loupe light mounted on the bridge of the loupes and side shields (not shown) on the temples to protect a dentist's eyes from splatter. As dental professionals use both hands in performing dental procedures, dental loupes are binocular and usually take the form of a pair of glasses. Some dental loupes are flip-type, which take the form of two small cylinders, one in front of each lens of the glasses. Other types are inset within the lens of the glasses. A typical magnification for use in dentistry is 2.5√ó, but dental loupes can be anywhere in the range from 2√ó to 8√ó. Together with proper access to the oral cavity, light is an important part of performing precision dentistry. Because a dentist's head often eclipses the overhead dental lamp, loupes may be fitted with a light source. Loupe-mounted lights used to be fed by fiber optic cables that connected to either a wall- mounted or table-top light source. Newer models feature a more convenient LED lamp within the loupe-mounted light and an electric cord coming from either the conventional wall-mounted or table-top light source or a belt clip rechargeable battery pack. Options for loupe-mounted cameras and video recorders are also available. =Surgery= Cardiac surgeon wearing surgical loupes Surgeons in many specialties commonly use loupes when doing surgery on delicate structures. The loupes used by surgeons are mounted in the lenses of glasses and are custom made for the individual surgeon, taking into account their corrected vision, interpupillary distance and desired focal distance. Multiple magnification powers are available. They are most commonly used in otolaryngology, neurosurgery, plastic surgery, cardiac surgery, orthopedic surgery, and vascular surgery. =Geology= Loupe used by a geologist The loupe (hand lens) is a vital geological field tool used to identify small mineral crystals and structures in rocks. =Biology= Loupes are used by professional and amateur field biologists for help identifying species in field situations where a full-sized microscope is impractical, but the ability to observe small morphological characteristics is desired. Many floras and diagnostic keys for identifying plant or animal species recommend the use of a loupe, because taxa may be separated by minute details like the presence of hairs, shapes of hairs and glands. =Meteoritics= Scientists in the meteoritics and planetary science field as well as private collectors of meteorites use loupes as one of their primary tools in meteorite classification and study, and also for simple examination in the field during meteorite recovery. =Electronics= Due to the extremely small size of many modern surface-mount components used in compact electronics, engineers often use a loupe to inspect the completed circuit board for manufacturing defects such as solder bridging and missing or misaligned components. While soldering or reworking surface-mount components by hand a loupe can be used for identifying and aligning parts. Due to the ever-decreasing size of electronic components, magnification is increasingly required for circuit assembly. =Tattooing= Tattoo artists use loupes to inspect the quality of their needle tips. They do this to ensure the least amount of damage possible to the skin surface. =Numismatists and coin collectors= Loupes are an essential tool in both numismatics, the study of currency, and the related practice of coin collection. Coin collectors frequently employ loupes for better evaluation of the quality of their coins, since identifying surface wear is vital when attempting to classify the grade of a coin. Uncirculated coins (coins without wear) can command a substantial premium over coins with slight wear. This wear cannot always be seen with the naked eye. Numismatists can also employ loupes to identify some counterfeit coins that would pass a naked- eye visual inspection. =Philatelists and stamp collectors= Stamp collectors employ loupes to improve their ability to evaluate the quality of their stamps. Identifying surface, adhesive, and perforation is vital when attempting to classify the grade of a stamp. Mint stamps (stamps without cancellations) with no wear can command a substantial premium over mint stamps with slight wear. This wear cannot always be seen with the naked eye. Practitioners of philately, the study of postage and revenue stamps, also employ loupes to identify counterfeit stamps that would pass naked-eye inspections. =Sharpening= Sharpeners of knives or other edged or pointed tools may use a loupe to inspect the tool and ensure correct angle, straightness of the bevel, a sharp edge and/or point, and a polished finish.

It works to support Returned Peace Corps Volunteers, encourage lifelong practice of the ideals of the Peace Corps, and serves as an advocacy organization to support and improve the Peace Corps. Overview Founded in 1979 and headquartered in Washington, D.C., the National Peace Corps Association (NPCA) is a nonprofit organization at the center of a vibrant and united community of 215,000 individuals who share the Peace Corps experience. The NPCA champions a lifelong commitment to Peace Corps ideals by connecting, engaging and promoting its members and member groups as they continue to make a difference in communities in the U.S. and around the world. NPCA is also dedicated to advocating for, contributing to, and supporting the betterment of the Peace Corps. NPCA encompasses a network of over 30,000 Returned Peace Corps Volunteers and more than 140 member groups. NPCA and its affiliates produce global education programs and advocacy campaigns, and provide community, national, and international services. It is governed by a board of directors and managed by a professional staff. NPCA is separate from the United States Peace Corps, which is a federal agency. History At conferences of global educators in the Midwest in the mid-1970s, a handful of Returned Peace Corps Volunteers began meeting regularly to discuss how to promote at home the values and lessons they had learned as Peace Corps Volunteers in the developing world. They adopted as their mission one of the three goals articulated by President John F. Kennedy when he created the Peace Corps in 1961: come home and teach your neighbors about the communities where you served. They gave the growing numbers of returning Peace Corps Volunteers in America a continuing mission and a communal identity as Returned Peace Corps Volunteers (RPCVs).Anon., Title 3 of the Code of Federal Regulations (Washington, D.C.: Office of the Federal Register, 2011), pp. 12‚Äì13.Hellstrom, T., Unofficial Peace Corps Volunteer Handbook (Morrisville: Lulu, 2010), p. 185. In 1979, these global educators joined with leaders of communities of RPCVs in New York and Washington, D.C. to create the National Council of Returned Peace Corps Volunteers (incorporated 1981). In 1993, we changed our name to the more inclusive National Peace Corps Association (NPCA). Upon their return from overseas, RPCVs continue to receive recognition from several organizations. 120,000 RPCVs accepted the Beyond War Award in 1987http://www.blip.tv/file/3177972 in honor of their commitment to nonviolence. Through their participation in volunteer projects or other endeavors, many RPCVs remain active in the Peace Corps community today. NPCA has encouraged and recognized outstanding service by members of the Peace Corps community by awarding over 20 Sargent Shriver awards for distinguished humanitarian service. We also recognize achievements with the Loret Miller Ruppe Awards that honor outstanding community service in the US and Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia. In response to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, NPCA created the Emergency Response Network (ERN) of Returned Peace Corps Volunteers willing to respond to crises when needed. Peace Corps Director Mark Gearan subsequently modeled the Crisis Corps (later renamed Peace Corps Response) after this successful program. In 2002, NPCA was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, along with the Peace Corps. Members of our organization continue to testify on Peace Corps legislation and key issues like safety and security, and our 2003 advocacy campaign helped garner the largest appropriation ever in Peace Corps history: $308 million for FY2004, plus another $15 million for Peace Corps HIV/ AIDS activities. In 2005 NPCA scored a crucial and significant victory for the independence of the Peace Corps and safety of Volunteers when it successfully coordinated the removal of Peace Corps references from military recruitment legislation. In coordination with the Returned Peace Corps Volunteers of Washington, D.C., NPCA organized 200 Returned Peace Corps Volunteers to march in President Barack Obama‚Äôs Inaugural Paradehttp://www.peacecorpsconnect.org/2009/01/behind-the-scenes-peace-corps- community-at-the-inaugural-parade/ on January 20, 2009. NPCA has played an important advisory role to Returned Peace Corps Volunteers seeking the return of Peace Corps programs to their countries of service, as in the recent cases of Sierra Leone and Indonesia. In 2009, the National Peace Corps Association launched Peace Corps Connect', a website and online social networking platform to help current and Returned Peace Corps Volunteers connect with each other and share ideas about projects, events, careers, and advocacy issues. The same year, NPCA launched Africa Rural Connect, its online collaboration space that brings together those who have lived and worked in Africa ‚Äì including the African Diaspora, rural farmers and Peace Corps volunteers ‚Äì to discuss solutions to agricultural challenges in sub-Saharan Africa.  Conferences  Throughout its history, the NPCA has endeavored to hold an annual event, ranging from large conferences and celebrations for major Peace Corps anniversaries to annual general meetings to satisfy bylaws requirements.

Publications WorldView, a magazine of news and comments about the Peace Corps world, is published four times a year by NPCA. Each issue provides a Peace Corps perspective to global issues by featuring articles by and about Peace Corps Volunteers, Returned Peace Corps Volunteers and people who \\"share the global values of the Peace Corps experience\\". Programs Peace Corps Connect is the annual conference of the Peace Corps community. The 2014 event was held in Nashville, Tennessee from June 19‚Äì21, 2014. The 2015 will be co-hosted with the Northern California Peace Corps Association in Berkeley, California in early June. Africa Rural Connect is an online global collaboration project to solve rural Africa's greatest challenges. It enables Africans, Peace Corps Volunteers, and anyone else with a connection to Sub-Saharan Africa to add their voice and build upon the ideas of others. The ARC Project introduces and encourages a new form of collaboration in order to identify creative, new plans to deal with the fundamental problems of agricultural development and rural poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa. With the technology, motivation and experience, the more people that get involved, the more creative the plans will become, and the greater exposure of the best ideas to improve development. The online contest will jump-start ideas which will form practical plans that, in turn, may gain public exposure, influence public policy and perhaps win financial support for implementation. The project aims to face the real needs, identify problems and take action with practical, timely, cost-effective local solutions. The best action plan wins a grand prize, including opportunities to meet with leaders in the development community to discuss bringing those ideas to life. RPCV Mentoring Program assists returning volunteers with their transition from Peace Corps service. The program's fundamental goal is to connect recently returned Peace Corps Volunteers with RPCV mentors one year after close of service. These mentors help ease the difficult transition and provide a connection to the RPCV community at large, adding a level of comfort. They supply advice, key networking contacts, share experiences and adjustment issues, offer guidance on further education, review resumes, assist with career planning and promote the many resources available to RPCVs in an effort to transition them from serving abroad to serving at home. E-Newsletter The National Peace Corps Association produces a number of electronic newsletters to connect, inform and engage the Peace Corps community. All three are open to the public to subscribe. NPCA News is sent on the third Thursday of each month (except August). GlobalEdNews is sent one to three times a month (except during the summer) to anyone interested in bringing global issues into classrooms and communities NPCA Advocacy is sent periodically with action alerts and the latest news on legislation affecting the Peace Corps community. Member Groups Over 140 Peace Corps alumni groups are affiliated with the NPCA. Most of the groups are based in local communities, and others are based on the country of Peace Corps service (called \\"Friends of\\" groups). In addition, some networks are based on shared interests. Groups promote global education, provide services in their communities and work with Peace Corps recruiting offices to support recently returned Peace Corps volunteers. Many support development projects overseas, and they sponsor forums and publications for information and issue discussions.

It originally appeared in the film and on the soundtrack of Higher Learning in 1994 and was eventually included on their second album Evil Empire (1996). On the back of the soundtrack, the song is called \\"Year of the Boomerang\\". Although the track was released as a promotional radio CD single, it was never given a domestic release. \\"Year of the Boomerang\\" made its live debut at Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson, CA on April 29, 1994. Spelling The track was re-recorded and included on their second album, Evil Empire in 1996. The spelling of the track was then altered to \\"Year of tha Boomerang\\". The spelling of \\"tha\\" in the title is a representation of the common hip-hop pronunciation of the definite article \\"the\\". The same spelling is used in the Evil Empire liner notes and lyrics to every song for nearly every instance of the word. The Higher Learning and album versions are slightly different. While the original version has a more prominent bass and hip hop feel, the Evil Empire version's guitars are mixed significantly heavier. Lyrical themes and references The title \\"Year of tha Boomerang\\" is a reference to Sartre's quotation \\"it is the moment of the boomerang\\", referring to anti-colonial violence in the preface to Frantz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth. The lyrics appear to be about minority representation and equality, as they contain several references to struggles against racism, sexism, and colonialism. These include the lines; \\"Tha sistas are in so check tha front line/It seems I spent the 80s in a Haiti state of mind\\" As well as; \\"It's dark now in Dachau and I'm screamin' from within/'Cause I'm still locked in tha doctrines of tha right/Enslaved by Dogma, ya talk about my birthright/Yet at every turn I'm runnin' into Hells gates/So I grip the cannon like Fanon and pass tha shells to my classmates\\" The song also contains the anthemic reprise; \\"I got no property but yo I'm a piece of it/So let the guilty hang\\" - in reference to the persecution by those in power of the masses, or the repressed. 'All power to the people' was the central motto of the Black Panther Party. The Mount Tai mention is a reference to a Maoist passage the Party's founder, Huey P. Newton, was fond of: 'To die for the revolution is heavier than Mount Tai'. Personnel Written in the liner notes as Guilty Parties: *Vocals - Zack de la Rocha *Bass - Tim Commerford *Drums - Brad Wilk *Guitars - Tom Morello  In popular culture  * In 2019, supporters of the QAnon movement co-opted \\"Year of tha Boomerang\\" to assert that the lyrics support the agenda of the movement's leader and allude to former President Barack Obama's citizenship, even though the song and the band's lyrics as a whole are considered left-wing, and the fact the song was released in 1994, fourteen years before Obama was elected president.

The song is featured on their fourth studio album, Palm Trees and Power Lines. An acoustic version of the song was released on Punk Goes Acoustic. The single is seen as the band's signature song. Music video There are two versions of the music video. One is an animated version while one is non-animated. The non-animated version shows Tim Pagnotta falling out of love at the start, and he decides to go back in time to put things right, using a time machine. He goes back to one week before. He then drives a car up to the girl's house but sees his past self quarreling with the girl. Pagnotta then uses the time machine to go back to two weeks before. He sees his past self kissing the girl on the beach. He is then discovered by them and gets into a fight with his past self. The girl gets upset and leaves. They then go back in time to three weeks before and kidnaps his past self and Pagnotta locks both his past selves inside the garage. He then gets back together with the girl. It is noticed that the chorus is always played while Pagnotta is going back in time in the non-animated version of the video. The animated version begins with a stick version of Pagnotta singing the first verse on a page in a book as a plane with a banner labeled \\"SUGARCULT\\" passes behind him. Then the entire band, in stick form, plays the chorus and frequently does so in the video. During the second verse there are images of many stick figures dancing next to the lyrics of the song as well as images of people with Pagnotta and his girlfriend's head. After Marko DeSantis performs the guitar solo Pagnotta is seen begging a girl for her love back on his knees, as he pulls his heart out (mirroring the lyric \\"tearing out my heart\\") to show her how sad he is. During the last chorus the stick version of the band is playing in a mash-up of all the different scenes. The video ends with the animated Pagnotta closing the book (which is labeled \\"Memories\\") and shedding a single tear before walking away. Live performances When the band plays this song during live performances, Tim sings a lower harmony on the chorus, while Airin Older, the bassist and backing vocals, sings the chorus melody.

The plan was directly related to the County of London Plan written by John Henry Forshaw (1895‚Äì1973) and Abercrombie in 1943. Following World War II, London was presented with an opportunity to amend the perceived failings of unplanned and haphazard development that had occurred as a result of rapid industrialisation in the nineteenth century. During the Second World War, the Blitz had destroyed large urban areas throughout the entire county of London, but particularly the central core. Over 50,000 inner London homes were completely destroyed, while more than 2 million dwellings experienced some form of bomb damage. This presented the London County Council with a unique chance to plan and rebuild vacant tracts of the city on a scale not seen since the Great Fire of London. The plan was based around five main issues facing London at the time: *Population growth *Housing *Employment and industry *Recreation *Transport Population growth Rapid population growth, combined with the inevitable return of many evacuees during the war, saw London facing significant housing shortages and density problems. The 118 square mile town was estimated to have a population of over 4 million in 1938. A series of four rings were outlined (Inner Urban, Suburban, Green Belt and Outer Country) in order to control development and limit sprawl into regional areas. The 'Inner Urban Ring' restricted any new housing or industrial development that were deemed to be above the limit of tolerable conditions, whilst reconstructing damaged buildings in a modern interpretation of their original state. The 'Suburban Ring' would be developed with a mix of both housing and light industry so that no regions became inefficient dormitory suburbs. The 'Green Belt Ring' encouraged the creation of parkland and recreational spaces, restrictions were placed on all development apart from that within existing villages. The 'Outer Country Ring' would support farmland whilst containing a number of satellite towns that would help to relocate large populations away from the overcrowded areas of central London. Housing The creation of new housing developments were to be mostly concentrated within areas damaged by the air raids, the suburban ring and in new satellite towns. Abercrombie notes the locations of existing communities within London, and aims to develop these communities as growth areas focused around a core neighbourhood. Housing development aimed to foster these communities with a mix of professions, family sizes and socio-economic groups. The 'Homes of One's Own' initiative aimed to reduce the number of families that were forced to share a dwelling (63.5% of families were forced to share their home in 1931). Affordable living options in both apartment and detached houses would be constructed under the Greater London Plan. Specific architectural styles would be adhered to throughout all new developments in order to create aesthetically pleasing streetscapes. Employment and industry The creation of strong neighbourhood centres would be complemented by a mix of commercial opportunities that service the immediate area. Employment opportunities were to be located in proximity to dwellings in order to allow the formation of a labour pool, yet not so close that it would adversely effect the surrounding populations. The main focus for manufacturing industries would be to relocate away from the dense inner city and into ‚Äònew towns‚Äô with access to a specialised labour force. Particular industries were to be located in areas with access to the relevant necessary resources such as rail stations or the River Thames. Complementary industries were encouraged to cluster together so that they could benefit from the input sharing and knowledge spillovers of each neighbouring firm. Recreation The development of open spaces was of high importance to Abercrombie in the Greater London Plan, recreation was seen as an essential part of life. All open spaces were to be retained, with particular significance given to the development of a 'green belt'. A variety of open spaces was to be established, from city squares and formal gardens to more wild and picturesque parks. A series of parkways would be created, allowing residents to walk between the major open spaces unimpeded by traffic. It was hoped that for every 1000 city residents there would be four acres of accessible open space. In 1944, some boroughs experienced 0.1 acre of open space per 1000 inhabitants. Abercrombie acknowledges that London is far too dense to provide an appropriate level of open space for each resident, so it is proposed that improved transport will allow every inhabitant access to recreational areas outside of their immediate neighbourhood. Transport Dwellings, industry and recreational spaces are all linked by transport within London. Ensuring adequate levels of efficient transport were key to the Greater London Plan. Although transportation had rapidly changed throughout the 20th century, the roadways had not. The number of cars in Britain had risen from 143,877 in 1910 to 3,084,896 in 1940. This led to areas of mass congestion and an increase in transport related accidents. Abercrombie sought to improve traffic circulation via an American inspired separation of differing modes on a number of levels throughout the city. A series of main arterial and ring roads would also allow road users to avoid the most congested sections of the network. Rail transit in London was to be separated into differing passenger and commercial networks. However rail was privately owned, creating an environment whereby planning legislation had little effect on the operations of railway companies. The River Thames was to be redefined as a focal point for the city, and it was hoped to maximize its potential as a trade and transport resource. Repercussions of The Greater London Plan Although the report was comprehensive in attempting to solve the issues facing London at the time, its implementation was not fully realised. The economic climate in Britain during the post war era simply did not allow for major infrastructure development on the scale that Abercrombie had suggested. Even though a gradualist, Geddesian style approach was suggested, Abercrombie may not have considered the minimal impact that one visionary can have on an ancient, complex and ever growing city such as London. No matter the resulting level of physical construction, the Greater London Plan was extremely successful in creating an optimistic outlook for the people of London, providing hope for the return of a great civilisation from the depths of World War Two. Proud City A 24-and-a-half minute film about the plan, called The Proud City ‚Äì A plan for London was produced for the Ministry of Information, with appearances by Abercrombie, J H Forshaw (Architect to the London County Council), Lord Latham (Leader of the LCC) and other members of the architect's staff. It was written and directed by Ralph Keene and is available online at the Internet Archive. Bibliography * Abercrombie, Patrick.

It originally was a half-hour local St. Louis television program, debuting October 17, 1983 on KSDK (channel 5), and ran in syndication until May 24, 2002, with repeats running until September 6. Overview Sally Jessy Rapha√´l was one of the first audience-participation, issue-driven talk shows to have a female host, predating Oprah by three years.Giuseppina Bonanni, show staff member 1989 through 2000 The program was an iconic part of the tabloid talk show genre that pervaded daytime television throughout much of the 1980s and 1990s. When the show started out it covered topics such as people with extreme religious beliefs, but in the later shows Sally and her after specialist Pat Ferrari moved on to more personal family matters such as pregnant and/or out-of-control teens. Topics of the show varied wildly, from the controversial and hard-hitting stories to more lighthearted fare such as hypnotists getting guests to do funny gags. As a result, when content ratings were introduced in the 1990s, the ratings for Sally varied widely from episode to episode, from TV-G to TV-14. Drag queens were frequently featured on the show, usually in fun, and some even dressed as Sally impersonators. The show that garnered her largest ratings was dedicated to women with large breasts. In the early years of the nationally syndicated run, Sally Jessy Rapha√´l remained a half hour show, but in 1986, Rapha√´l expanded production of each episode to an hour's length. However, broadcast markets were allowed to retain a half-hour packaging of her show, which most opted for, especially since stations already had successful half-hour entries, no matter local or national, scheduled before or after Sally. The 30-minute edits resorted to running the closing credit crawls before segments wrapped up, often as guests still had the floor. While only a select few markets picked up the full-hour Sally shows in the 1986-87 season, an increasing number of stations made the option over the next few years, especially as networks started to free up their daytime slots. For example, in January 1989, WCVB-TV in Boston, which had been airing the 30-minute Sally broadcasts at 11 a.m. (having previously aired them in late night slots from 1984 to 1987), opted to go with the hour- long version when the ABC soap opera Ryan's Hope, which WCVB aired (out of network pattern) at 11:30, was canceled. By 1990, all stations that carried Sally were airing her shows for 60 minutes. From the summer of 1987 through August 1989, the show originated from the studios of New Haven, Connecticut's WTNH (channel 8), where one large studio of the ABC affiliate's facility was divided to house both the talk show and WTNH's news set. In August 1989, Sally moved into the Unitel facilities in Manhattan, also home to MTV, and later, Rush Limbaugh. In 1998, the show moved to new production facilities in the former grand ballroom of the Hotel Pennsylvania (which had been modified as such by NEP Broadcasting), also in New York City, where it remained until its cancellation in 2002, sharing the space with sister series Maury with differing sets and studio layouts.Giuseppina Bonanni, show staff member 1989 through 2000 Famous con man Steve Comisar appeared on Sally as a fraud prevention expert, under the name Brett Champion.The Creep With the Golden Tongue by Sabrina R Erdely, GQ, August 2003, 126-32, 155-156.

Marshall Jewel Reed (May 28, 1917 ‚Äì April 15, 1980) was an American actor who appeared in over 200 films between 1943 and 1978. He was born in Englewood, Colorado. Early years Reed's parents were Walter George Reed and Ruth Dustin. By age 10, he was acting in children's theater, and he managed two drama groups while he was in high school. Before becoming a professional actor, \\"he held various odd jobs such as horse trainer, meter reader, bookkeeper, and mail clerk.\\"Aaker, Everett (2006). Encyclopedia of Early Television Crime Fighters. McFarland & Company, Inc. . Pp. 465-467. Stage Summer stock theatre at Elitch Gardens in Denver, Colorado, provided Reed's first professional experience with acting. Besides appearing in plays there, he made costumes and constructed scenery. Later he worked with other theatrical groups in the Denver area, writing and producing as well as acting. Still later, he had his own stock company on the West Coast and acted in summer stock in New York and Los Angeles. Film Reed started his cinema career in Bordertown Gun Fighters, a 1943 western starring Wild Bill Elliott. (Another source says, \\"He made his screen debut in Silver Spurs (1943).\\") An athletic stuntman, Reed handled much of his own fighting and riding.

The database includes data like the seafarer's address, photographs, signature, telephone, etc. An INDos number consists of eight alphanumeric characters. Henceforth, no seafarer without an INDos number will be admitted to any course other than a three-month pre-sea training course in India. All Indian and foreign nationals holding a COC (Certificate of Competency) granted by the Government of India or an Indian CDC (Continuous Discharge Certificate) or who have completed modular courses approved by DG Shipping are listed in the database. Courses not approved by the Government of India, except GMDSS, will not be included in the INDos data, but the new rule enforces institutes to upload GOC data on DGS website which requires INDos No:. The advantage to seafarers is that they do not need to carry the original document while training ashore with the implementation of INDos. For example, at present, a second mate has to undergo seven modular courses and one competency course for which he has to carry all his original documents. Once he has an INDOs certificate, he does have to produce the original document for admission to any course in India. Furthermore, in case of the loss of original documents, the INDos will help in retrieving a duplicate certificate. Notwithstanding INDos, seafarers still need to carry the original document while serving on board a ship.

The specific surface is derived from the resistance to flow of air (or some other gas) through a porous bed of the powder. The SI units are m2¬∑kg‚àí1 (\\"mass specific surface\\") or m2¬∑m‚àí3 (\\"volume specific surface\\"). Significance The particle size, or fineness, of powder materials is very often critical to their performance. Measurement of air permeability can be performed very rapidly, and does not require the powder to be exposed to vacuum or to gases or vapours, as is necessary for the BET method for determination of specific surface area. This makes it both very cost-effective, and also allows it to be used for materials which may be unstable under vacuum. When a powder reacts chemically with a liquid or gas at the surface of its particles, the specific surface is directly related to its rate of reaction. The measurement is therefore important in the manufacture of many processed materials. In particular, air permeability is almost universally used in the cement industry as a gauge of product fineness which is directly related to such properties as speed of setting and rate of strength development. Other fields where air permeability has been used to determine specific surface area include: * Paint and pigments * Pharmaceuticals * Metallurgical powders, including sintered metal filters. In some fields, particularly powder metallurgy, the related Fisher number is the parameter of interest. This is the equivalent average particle diameter, assuming that the particles are spherical and have uniform size. Historically, the Fisher number was obtained by measurement using the Fisher Sub-sieve Sizer, a commercial instrument containing an air pump and pressure regulator to establish a constant air flow, which is measured using a flowmeter. A number of manufacturers make equivalent instruments, and the Fisher number can be calculated from air permeability specific surface area values. Methods Measurement consists of packing the powder into a cylindrical \\"bed\\" having a known porosity (i.e. volume of air-space between particles divided by total bed volume). A pressure drop is set up along the length of the bed cylinder. The resulting flow-rate of air through the bed yields the specific surface by the Kozeny‚ÄìCarman equation:Carman P C, J.Soc.Chem.Ind., 57, p 225 (1938) :S=\\\\cfrac{7d}{\\\\rho\\\\,(1-\\\\epsilon\\\\,)}\\\\sqrt{\\\\dfrac{\\\\epsilon\\\\,^3\\\\pi\\\\,\\\\delta\\\\,P}{l\\\\eta\\\\,Q}} where: :S is specific surface, m2¬∑kg‚àí1 :d is the cylinder diameter, m :œÅ is the sample particle density, kg¬∑m‚àí3 :Œµ is the volume porosity of the bed (dimensionless) :Œ¥P is the pressure drop across the bed, Pa :l is the cylinder length, m :Œ∑ is the air dynamic viscosity, Pa¬∑s :Q is the flowrate, m3¬∑s‚àí1 It can be seen that the specific surface is proportional to the square root of the ratio of pressure to flow. Various standard methods have been proposed: * Maintain a constant flowrate, and measure the pressure drop * Maintain a constant pressure drop, and measure the flowrate * Allow both to vary, deriving the ratio from the characteristics of the apparatus. =Lea and Nurse method= The second of these was developed by Lea and Nurse.Lea F M, Nurse R W, J.Soc.Chem.Ind., 58, p 227 (1939) The bed is 25 mm in diameter and 10 mm thick. The desired porosity (which may vary in the range 0.4 to 0.6) is obtained by using a calculated weight of sample, pressed to precisely these dimensions. The required weight is given by: :M=\\\\tfrac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\,d^2l\\\\rho\\\\,(1-\\\\epsilon\\\\,) A flowmeter consisting of a long capillary is connected in series with the powder bed. The pressure drop across the flowmeter (measured by a manometer) is proportional to the flowrate, and the proportionality constant can be measured by direct calibration. The pressure drop across the bed is measured by a similar manometer. Thus the required pressure/flow ratio can be obtained from the ratio of the two manometer readings, and when fed into the Carman equation, yields an \\"absolute\\" value of the air permeability surface area. The apparatus is maintained at a constant temperature, and dry air is used so that the air viscosity can be obtained from tables. =Rigden method= This was developedRigden P J, J.Soc.Chem.Ind., 62, p 1 (1943) in the desire for a simpler method. The bed is connected to a wide-diameter u-tube containing a liquid such as kerosene. On pressurizing the space between the u-tube and the bed, the liquid is forced down. The level of liquid then acts as a measure of both pressure and volume flow. The liquid level rises as air leaks out through the bed. The time taken for the liquid level to pass between two pre-set marks on the tube is measured by stop-watch. The mean pressure and mean flowrate can be derived from the dimensions of the tube and the density of the liquid. A later development used mercury in the u-tube: because of mercury's greater density, the apparatus could be more compact, and electrical contacts in the tube touching the conductive mercury could automatically start and stop a timer. =Blaine method= This was developedBlaine R L, Bull.Am.Soc.Test.Mater., 123, p 51 (1943) independently by R L Blaine of the American National Bureau of Standards, and uses a small glass kerosene manometer to apply suction to the powder bed. It differs from the above methods in that, because of uncertainty of the dimensions of the manometer tube, absolute results can't be calculated from the Carman equation. Instead, the apparatus must be calibrated, using a known standard material. The original standards, supplied by NBS, were certified using the Lea and Nurse method. Despite this shortcoming, the Blaine method is now by far the most commonly used for cement materials, mainly because of the ease of maintenance of the apparatus and simplicity of the procedure.e.g. ASTM Standard Test Method C 204 See also * Klinkenberg correction References Category:Chemical engineering Category:Particle technology ","title":"Air permeability specific surface"},{"id":"11817972","text":"Nathan Baxter is the name of: *Nathan Baxter (bishop) (born 1948), American bishop *Nathan Baxter (footballer) (born 1998), English footballer ","title":"Nathan Baxter"},{"id":"11817984","text":"Norman Stiles (born December 4, 1942) is a television writer best known for his work on the show Sesame Street.

Stiles is perhaps best known for writing the episode segments about the death of the character Mr. Hooper (whose actor, Will Lee, had died of a heart attack in 1983). Stiles wanted to convey that expressing grief for someone who had died was difficult for both adults and children. Instead of providing an explanation, the adults of Sesame Street tell Big Bird, when he asked why Mr. Hooper had died, that there was no real reason, that it happened, as Gordon tells Big Bird, \\"Just because\\". The show's outside experts advised Stiles and the producers to remove the line because they were concerned that an open-ended explanation would not be enough for children, but Stiles kept the line because it was an acknowledgement. As part of the Sesame Street writing team, Stiles received eight Daytime Emmy Awards. He also wrote for NBCs 1976‚Äì1977 situation comedy The Practice.

She was the main host of Univision Puerto Rico talk and variety show Anda Pa'l Cara from 2005 to 2009, as well as the host of Telemundo Puerto Rico entertainment show Dando Candela until 2013. She was also the radio host of Fidelity 95.7 FM morning show Gozando en la Ma√±ana, with Raymond Arrieta. She had her own talk show Alexandra De Noche (now Telemundo De Noche) on Telemundo Puerto Rico until she left the show on 2016 to support her spouse, David Bernier, in his campaign for Governor of Puerto Rico.  Early years and education  Alexandra Fuentes was born in the Regional Hospital of Caguas, Puerto Rico, and raised in the Rabanal ward of Cidra. Her parents are Nilda Rivera, a homemaker and seamstress, and Rub√©n Fuentes, a mechanic. Fuentes has an older sister, Ver√≥nica, and two younger siblings, Natalia and Rub√©n. From an early age, Fuentes showed interest in acting. When she was 12 years old, she joined the Pitri Group, a local theater troupe founded by V√≠ctor Torres, where she performed as an actress and dancer. In a 2015 interview, Torres praised Fuentes' discipline, which he called \\"her best weapon to achieve what she has today\\". He also added that Fuentes was \\"dynamic, knew what she wanted, was helpful, good friend, and always had that naturality that she still preserves\\". During those years, she distinguished herself with imitations of Cantinflas and La India Mar√≠a, two popular Mexican characters. In 1996, Fuentes graduated from Ana J. Candelas High School, where she was president of the Yearbook club. After that, she went to the University of Puerto Rico in R√≠o Piedras where she studied Labor Relations. She also completed a Master's degree in Business Administration from Universidad del Turabo. During her college years, she continued acting in theater.  Entertainment career  Fuentes started her professional career in the early 2000s, when she worked as a reporter for the show Z√∫mbate. After that, she became part of the local parody show S√°lvese Quien Pueda where she came to be known for parodying Gricel Mamery. During that time, she also started hosting the segment NBA Jams in Deportes 13. In the summer of 2005, producer Tony Mojena offered her to be the host of Pa' Que te lo Goces. That same year she was hired to replace Mamery as host of Anda Pa'l Cara. In an interview, she described that year as \\"magical\\".

Dictionary of Physical Geography. London: Penguin, 1984. . Carrs are wetlands that are dominated by shrubs rather than trees.https://www.turtleguardians.com/sample-page/turtle- habitats/swamps-and-carrs/ The carr is one stage in a hydrosere: the progression of vegetation beginning from a terrain submerged by fresh water along a river or lake margin. In sub-maritime regions, it begins with reed- marsh. As the reeds decay, the soil surface eventually rises above the water, creating fens that allow vegetation such as sedge to grow. As this progression continues, riparian trees and bushes appear and a carr landscape is created ‚Äì in effect a wooded fen in a waterlogged terrain. At this stage, overall, unlike the overwhelming acidity of decaying reeds, the pH is not too acidic and the soil is not too deficient in minerals, making a habitat for endemic and other wildlife. Characteristic water tolerant trees include alder and willow.

Characteristics Sigatoka leaf spot disease (SD) is a disease of bananas and is caused by the ascomycetous fungus, Mycosphaerella musicola. This pathogen can be distinguished morphologically from Mycosphaerella fijiensis, which causes black leaf streak disease (BLSD), by the characteristics of the conidia and conidiophore. The anamorph of M. musicola, Pseudocercospora musae, lacks the thickened cell walls that are present at the base of the conidia of Paracercospora fijien, the anamorph of M. fijiensis, and are shorter and less wavy. The conidiophores of P. musae are bottle-shaped and much smaller than the elongated conidiophores of P. fijiensis which are often bent and bear conspicuous conidial scars. The two species can also be differentiated by molecular methods.INIBAP Distribution Mycosphaerella musicola was first reported from Java in 1902 and by 1962 was found in most banana growing regions of the world. Although it is spread over short distances by conidia and ascospores, over long distances it is the movement of infected germplasm such as diseased leaves and suckers that is likely to be responsible. In the Pacific islands and in lowland areas of South America and Africa, symptoms of SD are now rarely seen and BLSD has largely supplanted it. SD is more adapted to cooler regions and often predominates at altitudes over 1200 metres while BLSD is rarely seen at such elevations. Life cycle When spores of M. musicola are deposited on a susceptible banana leaf they germinate within three hours if there is a film of water present or if the humidity is very high. The optimal temperature for germination of the conidia is between 25-29 ¬∞C and for the ascospores, 25-26 ¬∞C. The germ tube grows epiphytically over the epidermis for about five days before penetrating the leaf via a stoma.Meredith DS (1970) 'Banana leaf spot disease(Sigatoka) caused by Mycosphaerella musicola Leach.' (Commonwealth Mycological Institute, Kew, Surrey, England) Once inside the leaf the invasive hypha forms a vesicle and fine hyphae grow through the mesophyll layers into an air chamber. More hyphae then grow into the palisade tissue and continue on into other air chambers, eventually emerging through stomata in the streak that has developed. Further epiphytic growth occurs before the re-entry of the hypha into the leaf through another stoma repeats the process.PaDILJones DR (2000) Sigatoka. In 'Diseases of Banana, Abac√° and Enset'. (Ed. DR Jones) pp. 79-92. (CABI Publishing: Wallingford) Both conidia and ascospores are important for dispersal of M. musicola with the ascospores being involved in the movement of the pathogen over longer distances than the conidia.Stover RH (1971) Leaf spot of bananas caused by Mycosphaerella musicola: Role of conidia in epidemiology. Phytopathology 60, 856-860. The deposition of ascospores by wind currents is generally near the tips of the leaves resulting in a distinctive pattern of infection on the leaf extremities. When conidia are the source of the inoculum and these are dislodged by rain, a distinctive line of streaks is produced as water trickles down the leaf blade. Symptoms It is not always easy to differentiate between the symptoms of SD and BLSD. The first sign of disease in SD is the appearance of small yellow streaks on the upper side of leaves while in BLSD small, dark brown streaks appear on the lower surface of leaves. These streaks enlarge and coalesce forming necrotic lesions with light gray centres and yellow perimeters. Large areas of leaf can be damaged causing a lowering of photosynthetic ability, a reduction in crop yield and premature ripening of the fruit. BLSD is the more serious of the diseases as the symptoms emerge on younger leaves and it affects many cultivars that have developed resistance to SD, including the plantain subgroup.

Originally aired on March 15, 2006 on Fox network, the episode is written by Stephen Nathan and directed by Allan Kroeker. The episode features FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth and Dr. Temperance Brennan's investigation into two murder victims from two different cases. Plot Dr. Temperance Brennan organizes a date with a man she recently met online. Her boss, Dr. Daniel Goodman, arrives and tells her that they have a new case ‚Äî a member of the Cugini family, who was part of the mafia, had been found at the bottom of a river, with cement shoes. Special Agent Seeley Booth arrives with Special Agent James Kenton, who had been working undercover with the chief suspects for the murder, the Romano family, for two years. Following this, Booth receives a newer and more important case that needs their attention ‚Äî a female victim who had been tied up and fed to dogs. After Brennan examines the remains of the female victim and deduces the method of killing, Booth tells Brennan of a similar case that he had worked on, and that his prime suspect, Kevin Hollings, had gone free. Brennan leaves the crime scene to go on her date with the man she had met on the internet, David Simmons. While walking to the restaurant, she is shot at, and only avoids being hit by bending over to retrieve her dropped cell phone as the shots were fired. While her colleagues are concerned for her, Brennan refuses to stop work, claiming that the best way to find the murderers would be to have her on the case, and then therefore they would catch her attacker too. Despite Brennan's wishes, Booth brings in her date, David, as a suspect, pointing out he would have known where to find her. While Booth tries to prove that David was the one who organized the attack on Brennan, he is displeased when she seems to be very attracted to David. Booth expresses to Brennan and David his discomfort with the entire \\"internet thing\\". Then when Booth says that it is \\"creepy\\" to Brennan while David is in the room, David says that he doesn't want to \\"get in the way of anything\\", referring to Brennan and Booth, whom he has mistaken for a couple. Shocked at David's misinterpretation of their relationship both Booth and Brennan set David straight and vehemently deny that there is any attraction between them. Angela Montenegro manages to identify the victim as Penny Hamilton, a college student, and Brennan attempts to use an experimental method to identify the gun used on the mafia victim. Zack correctly finds one of the knives used on the college student and realizes that the murder weapon had a nick in the blade, making it distinctive. Booth and Brennan visit the home of the man Booth suspects of the murder of the college girl, Kevin Hollings. They find a knife with no nick on the blade, and a collection of thousands of keys. While Hollings refuses to talk, Brennan realizes that the keys could be what was used to gouge out the eyes of the victim, and orders a photo of each key to be taken to match with the markings on the skull, prior to their release. Concerned for her safety, Booth accompanies Brennan home. Brennan, however seems surprised at Booth's assertion that he spend the night when he says that he'll sleep on the couch. After some mild objection from Brennan on the subject, the two seem to settle in and begin listening to music on Brennan's CD player. Booth appears taken aback at Brennan's wide array of jazz music saying that he thought \\"all that free form stuff might be a little too much for you\\". Brennan, however, asserts that she actually loves it and Booth seems surprised at her evident love of music. After that Booth finds a Foreigner CD and begins playing \\"Hot Blooded\\" and he begins to dance to it and after some coaxing, Brennan begins to dance with him. This is seen by many fans as an early bonding moment in their partnership and is seen to contain certain romantic undertones. However, their joviality comes to an end when David calls to check up on Brennan and Brennan reveals that Booth is with her. After Brennan gets rid of David, Booth seems worried that David might have gotten the wrong impression and could believe that Booth being there was of a more social or even sexual nature than in actuality. Brennan dismisses his worries by saying that it wasn't a problem. Booth breaks the awkward silence that settles in by asking her if she has anything to drink and when Brennan goes to get it for him, he stops her saying that he's not her guest and goes to get it himself. However, when he goes to get the drink from her refrigerator, it explodes, seriously injuring him. Bones grabs the blanket off her couch, and puts out the fire on his chest, saving him. After he is taken to the hospital, he assigns Kenton the job of protecting Brennan. The chemicals used in the explosion are identified as belonging to the company for which Hollings works. Dr. Jack Hodgins visits Booth to update him on the case. Together, they realize that Hollings was being framed, and that it must be someone from somewhere within the lab. Just as they realize this, Brennan is kidnapped by Kenton and taken to a warehouse. He ties her up, and prepares to kill her in an identical method to how Hollings killed his previous victims, in order to frame him (it is also implied that Kenton killed Hollings offscreen). Booth arrives just in time shooting Kenton and saving Brennan from certain death. Following the events, Booth returns to the hospital, and the episode closes with Brennan canceling her date in order to spend time with Booth as he recovers, and the two watch The Grapes of Wrath. Production During the scene where Booth and Brennan dance to Foreigner's \\"Hot Blooded\\", both David Boreanaz, playing Booth, and Emily Deschanel, playing Brennan, wore earphones. However, during filming, one of them fell off Boreanaz. According to Boreanaz in the episode's audio commentary, he admitted that he remembered his words from the script, but struggled to remember them while in the car scenes, so he put the script on the dashboard to remind him what to say next.

YMS-192 served along the U.S. East Coast and in the Caribbean until the Atlantic War ended in May 1945. Sent to the Pacific, she took part in post-war mine clearance operations off Japan. YMS-192 returned to the U.S. in April 1946 and was decommissioned in May. While laid up in reserve at San Diego, California, she was reclassified as a Motor Minesweeper, AMS-5 and named USS Condor 18 February 1947. Recommissioned for Korean War service in November 1950, Condor deployed to the combat zone in March 1951. She provided minesweeping and patrol services off Korea and Japan to the end of the conflict in July 1953 and continued her activities in that area during the following years. Condor was reclassified as coastal minesweeper MSC(O)-5 on 7 February 1955. Condor was loaned to Japan a month later. She was renamed JDS Ujishima (MSC-655) during her service with the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force.

Plot Andy Hardy from Carvel becomes infatuated with a well- known young socialite, Daphne Fowler, from New York City. Even though he hasn‚Äôt met the woman in person, he drops her name to his friends and tells them that they are very well acquainted. He even lets his friends believe he is romantically involved with Miss Fowler. Hardy‚Äôs senseless namedropping gets him into trouble when his father, the honorable judge James K. Hardy, decides to move to New York with the whole family, to work on a case involving an orphanage. The judge has to appear in court against a law firm that is disputing payments from a trust fund that supports the orphanage.

He goes off on a pursuit to meet Daphne and become friends with her. In New York, Andy encounters an old female friend, Betsy Booth, who happens to have a crush on him. Soon Andy has to evade romantic propositions from Betsy, while he is trying to meet with the popular and seemingly unattainable Daphne. Against all odds, Andy hears on radio that Daphne is to attend a function at a restaurant. He manages to get into the restaurant where Daphne is present, but he gets into trouble when he can‚Äôt live up to his own story about being a wealthy man, not being able to pay his bill. Things look dark for Andy, but his father goes from despair to success when he wins the orphanage case.

Background Sired by Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame inductee Deputy Minister, Touch Gold is out of the mare Passing Mood, a daughter of U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Buckpasser. A late foal born at the end of May, he was purchased by Frank Stronach for $375,000 at the July 1995 Keeneland select yearling sale. He was sent into training with Daniel J. Vella at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Racing career =1996: two-year-old season= After Touch Gold won a 6-furlong maiden race, his best 1996 stakes results were a third in the Grey Stakes and a second in the Swynford Stakes. =1997: three-year-old season= Early season Sent to race in the United States under new trainer David Hofmans, Touch Gold won a 6-furlong allowance race at Santa Anita Park, then at Keeneland Race Course won April's Lexington Stakes, in which he defeated top three-year-old Smoke Glacken by 8¬Ω lengths. Not entered in the Kentucky Derby, Touch Gold competed in the second leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series, the Preakness Stakes. At the start of the race, the colt stumbled but rallied to challenge the leaders until he tired in the homestretch to finish fourth behind Silver Charm. He came out of the Preakness with a sore left front hoof but recovered enough to enter the Belmont Stakes three weeks later. 1997 Belmont Stakes Going into the 1997 Belmont Stakes, Silver Charm was favored to become the first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978. His main opposition was expected to come from the entry of Touch Gold and Wild Rush, stretch-running Crypto Star, and Free House who had finished third in the Derby and second in the Preakness. In the Belmont, Touch Gold held a slim lead early but relinquished it at the halfway mark. Coming into the top of the stretch, he was fourth, blocked behind a wall of horses running three-wide. Jockey Chris McCarron swung Touch Gold to the far outside, where he rallied to win over Silver Charm by three-quarters of a length. After Belmont After his 1997 Belmont Stakes win, Touch Gold was sent to rest in California in order to allow his sore hoof time to heal. He eventually returned to win that year's Grade I Haskell Invitational Handicap at Monmouth Park but in the fall's Breeders' Cup Classic, he finished ninth and last. At age four in 1998, he raced four times, only going back to the track at the end of June when he won a one-mile allowance race at Churchill Downs in a time of 1:34, one fifth of a second off the track record. His next best result came in October when he finished second in the Fayette Stakes. In the Breeders' Cup Classic, he finished eighth in a ten-horse field. Stud career Owned by a syndicate that includes Frank Stronach, Touch Gold stands at stud at Adena Springs in Midway, Kentucky. He sired four Grade I winners in his first two crops. In 2006, his son Royal Challenger won the Breeders' Stakes, the third leg of the Canadian Triple Crown, and Seek Gold won the Grade I Stephen Foster Handicap. Touch Gold was pensioned from stud duty in 2015, and was sent to Old Friends Equine Thoroughbred Retirement Farm. He resides there along with his son, Seek Gold.

Lipski worked as an umbrella stick salesman, employing Harry Schmuss and Henry Rosenbloom. The series of events leading up to his execution began on 28 June 1887 when police were summoned to 16 Batty Street; a young woman, Miriam Angel, had been murdered after being forced to consume nitric acid. She was 6 months pregnant at the time. The coroner at her inquest was Wynne Edwin Baxter. Lipski was found underneath her bed, with acid burns inside his own mouth, and was subsequently arrested. Lipski protested his innocence, claiming that Schmuss and Rosenbloom were responsible, but he was charged with murder. The ensuing trial created a storm of controversy, with suggestions that the trial was tarnished by institutional anti-Semitism. Home Secretary Henry Matthews was personally opposed to capital punishment, but remained impartial in Lipski's case. In the event, the jury took only eight minutes to find Lipski guilty and he was sentenced to hang. The verdict, however, aroused immediate controversy and a press campaign to reprieve Lipski was orchestrated by William Thomas Stead, editor of the Pall Mall Gazette. Even Queen Victoria was said to be troubled by the prospect of Lipski being executed solely on the evidence that had been presented to the court. As a result of this mounting public disquiet, the execution was postponed for one week while Matthews and the trial judge, Mr Justice Stephen, met to consider a reprieve. While they were meeting, however, Lipski broke down and made a full confession to the East End rabbi and community spokesman Simeon Singer, claiming that his motive had been robbery and not, as had been claimed by the prosecution, rape. He was hanged the following day, 22 August 1887, in the yard of Newgate Prison. Connection to the Jack the Ripper case Israel Schwartz, a man of \\"Jewish appearance\\", reported witnessing a woman being assaulted on Berner Street in the early morning of 30 September 1888. When the unknown man shouted out \\"Lipski!\\" to either Schwartz or another man, Schwartz fled. He later identified the woman as Elizabeth Stride, who is thought to have been murdered by Jack the Ripper around that time or shortly after. Police originally investigated whether there was someone in the neighbourhood by the name of Lipski. The murder of Miriam Angel had happened the year before only one street away on the same block. Police eventually decided that the term was being used as an ethnic slur against Jews, although several individuals with the surname Lipski resided in this area.The Jewish East End 1840-1939 p. 113 Further reading *Friedland, Martin L., The Trials of Israel Lipski: A True Story of a Victorian Murder in the East End of London (New York: Beaufort Books, 1984) References External links * Lipski trial testimony ‚Äì witness testimony from the Old Bailey trial Category:1865 births Category:1887 deaths Category:1887 crimes Category:19th-century executions by England and Wales Category:English people convicted of murder Category:People convicted of murder by England and Wales Category:English people of Polish-Jewish descent Category:English Jews Category:Executed English people Category:People executed for murder Category:1880s murders in the United Kingdom ","title":"Israel Lipski"},{"id":"11818593","text":"Speicher XI, fine arts and design faculty.

W. Bush and Boris Yeltsin. The USRJC was established to determine the fates of the United States's and the Soviet Union's unaccounted-for service personnel from World War II, the Korean War, the Cold War (as defined by the USRJC's directive to be specific \\"reconnaissance missions\\"), Afghanistan and the Vietnam War, Laos and Cambodia. Information exchanged between the two parties is then investigated by a spectrum of governmental entities. In the U.S., the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing in Action (POW/MIA) Accounting Agency (DPAA) is the lead agency responsible for personnel accounting. The Commission, holds a formal Plenary to discuss a spectrum of issues that involve Prisoners of War and Missing in Action such as; archival research, reported gravesites, loss incident reports, shoot-downs, archival reports, Soviet Bloc nation intelligence and reports, information passed on to the Commission and to establish the direction the USRJC and its Working Groups. Commission Members and researchers interview former military personnel, civilians, former Internees, contract for archival access, research, search military museums, and expand the investigative program in an effort to account for Missing service members. Joint Commission Support Division (JCSD), Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) provides administrative and analytic support to the U.S. Side of the U.S.‚ÄìRussia Joint Commission on POW/MIAs (USRJC) and conducts research in Russia on missing U.S. service personnel. JCSD also assists the Government of Russia with efforts to account for its missing. U.S. analysts have had access to many important Russian governmental archives for research on past conflicts including the Central Archives of the Ministry of Defense in Podolsk, Russia‚Äîthe largest military archive in Europe. After a period of decreased cooperation starting in 2006, U.S. President Obama and Russian President Medvedev revitalized the work of the USRJC in July 2009 with an exchange of Diplomatic Notes reaffirming their respective countries' commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation on POW/MIA issues. Retired Air Force General Robert H. ‚ÄúDoc‚Äù Foglesong has served as Chairman of the U.S. Side since April 2006. The most recent Russian Presidential Decree on the USRJC, issued in July 2014, appointed General-Colonel (retired) Valeriy.A. Vostrotin as the Chairman of the Commission‚Äôs Russian Side and fills other vacant Russian commissioner seats. The USRJC is broken down into four Working Groups which correlate to the four main areas of investigation. There is the World War II Working Group, the Korean War Working Group, the Cold War Working Group and finally, the Vietnam War Working Group, which deals with aspects of the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue. Efforts Relating to World War II (WWII): JCSD analysts conduct research of Soviet military and captured German documents in Russian archives searching for information on specific American WWII losses that occurred in areas controlled or eventually captured by Soviet forces. Efforts Relating to the Korean War: Russian archives detail combat activities of Soviet air and anti-aircraft artillery units deployed to defend military targets in the northwest area of North Korea. Thus far, Russian archival data has provided information which clarified the circumstances of loss for 336 cases involving missing U.S. servicemen from the Korean War. Researchers interviewed more than 1,000 Soviet veterans of the Korean War since the USRJC began its work in the former USSR. Efforts Relating to the Cold War: JCSD analysts investigate the air losses of U.S. servicemen missing during the Cold War between 1950 and 1965 that occurred along the periphery of the former Soviet Union. Since 1992, U.S. analysts assigned to JCSD have worked with Soviet-era veterans, Russian government officials, and archival researchers to gather data on the 126 U.S. service members who are still unaccounted for as a result of fourteen separate Cold War incidents. JCSD analysts continue to assist the Russians in accounting for Soviet soldiers missing from the 1979- 1989 war in Afghanistan and other Cold War-era incidents. Efforts related to the Vietnam War: Since 1992, researchers interviewed more than 750 Soviet veterans of the Vietnam War. JCSD cultivates contacts with Russian veterans‚Äô groups to identify possible interview subjects. JCSD continues to pursue declassification of Russia‚Äôs Vietnam War information that may help clarify the fate of missing U.S. service personnel from that conflict. Charter For the U.S. Side of the U.S.-Russia Joint Commission on Prisoners of War / Missing In Action (POW/MIAs): 1\\\\. Commission‚Äôs Official Designation: U.S. Side of the U.S.‚ÄìRussia Joint Commission on POW/MIAs (USRJC or the Commission), will hereinafter be referenced as the ‚ÄúU.S. Side.‚Äù The USRJC refers to the entire Russian and U.S. Commission. 2\\\\. Purpose and Authority: The Presidents of the United States and the Russian Federation inaugurated the USRJC on March 26, 1992, to establish a bilateral mechanism for investigating matters concerning the presence of U.S. POW/MIAs on the territory of the former Soviet Union . On July 6, 2009, the U.S. Government and the Government of the Russian Federation exchanged diplomatic notes reflecting their common understandings regarding the establishment of bilateral cooperation in the sphere of determining the fates of Soviet/Russian and U.S. service-members missing in action (MIA) during the Second World War and wars and armed conflicts thereafter, and expressing their mutual commitment to the humanitarian goal of determining the fates of Soviet/Russian and U.S. servicemembers who are MIA as a result of wars and armed conflicts. Over the past 20 years, the USRJC advised the U.S. and Russian governments regarding the fates of U.S. and Soviet/Russian servicemen and civilians in the employment of their governments who are unaccounted for from World War II through Cold War military conflicts, during Soviet military operations in Afghanistan (1979-1989), and in other small- scale hostile encounters between opposing forces.

It has approximately 2350 inhabitants and is placed in the Naturpark Rhein-Westerwald. The municipality is spelled with the 'sharp s' character √ü which may ever so often be replaced by a 'ss', as e.g. in standard in English spelling or in the website www.grossmaischeid.de). First settlements in Gro√ümaischeid date back to the late Bronze Age (1550 - 1200 BC). The Roman border fortification 'limes' was erected around 80AD in the vicinity of Gro√ümaischeid. The town was first mentioned in an official document issued by pope Eugene III which dates back to 20 January 1148. Its name is most probably derived from 'Metsched's place', referring to a medieval local nobleman. It is assumed that the town as such was a planned settlement around the time of Charlemagne in order to stop the Saxons from expanding into western regions of Germany in the early 9th century. The town center is dominated by the catholic St. Bonifatius church which was first mentioned in 1555 and whose tower dates back to the 12th century. The town is situated 5 km south of the A3 motorway and about 75 km away from Cologne und 115 km from Frankfurt. Kausen, a former hamlet at the Saynbach river was included into the municipality of Gro√ümaischeid in 1974. Larger cities in the vicinity of Gro√ümaischeid are Koblenz and Neuwied, both of which are around 25 km away. A mere 1.5 km North of Gro√ümaischeid (Maischeid-Major) is the former hamlet of Kleinmaischeid (Maischeid-Minor). Both places are sometimes referred to simply as Maischeid, referring to their common history. The local dialect in Gro√ümaischeid is a moselle-frankonian. The town is known for its active community life driven by a series of themed clubs and amateur organisations such as the \\"Spielmannszug Gro√ümaischeid 1959 e.V.\\" (Spielmannszug is a kind of marching band). Highlight of the activities is the annual Carneval parade, traditionally held on 'Pancake Tuesday' (Veilchendienstag). The local Football team \\"Sportverein Maischeid e.V.\\" is founded in 1923 and plays at the Waldstadion.

The site also contained the MGWR railway works and a steam locomotive motive power depot. A Luas tram station opened at the front of the station in 2017. It is currently the headquarters of Bus √âireann, housing most of their administration and one of their main garages. Nearby on the same property is a Dublin Bus Depot. History =Etymology= The name derives from the Norse \\"Bradogue Steyn\\" or \\"Broad Stone\\", due to the Bradogue River crossing the road to Finglas at this location. \\"Bradogue\\" itself means \\"Young Salmon\\". =Beginnings= Designed by John Skipton Mulvany, the structure was built between 1841 and 1850, with the addition of the colonnade in 1861. Broadstone Station is constructed of granite in a neo-Egyptian style. During the construction of the permanent roof in the late 1840s it was damaged by a severe gale but complete disaster was averted by the earlier timber structure over which it was being built. The by two span roof is said to have been basis of the design for the larger span at Liverpool Lime street. In 1845 the Royal Canal was purchased by the Midland Great Western Railway Company (MGWR) with a view to using the land alongside the canal to construct a railway line to the west of Ireland. The line was constructed in stages and by 1848 reached Mullingar. Similarly Broadstone station was worked in tandem with opening in 1847 and final completion 1850. The MGWR developed locomotive and carriage works around the station. With the construction of the colonnade in 1861 trains arrived to the east side platform and passengers exited through the colonnade. Trains departed from the west side platform where there was a booking office and waiting rooms. The four middle tracks were used to stable rolling stock in the interim. The building at front of the station was used as the headquarters building for the MGWR and did not contain a passenger entrance. With Galway projected to become the main port for transatlantic passenger traffic between Europe and North America, the MGWR successfully competed with its rival the Great Southern and Western Railway to reach it first in August 1851. A special fourth class was introduced by the MGWR for poor migrants from the west going to Britain for work. The line, which branched out to serve Sligo, Westport, Achill and Clifden, was also used to transport large numbers of cattle. It was about this time that the majority of the houses in the area were constructed, as dwellings for workers on the railway. Most of the houses were built by the Artisan's Dwelling Company, which built many similar estates in Dublin and elsewhere, and houses of this type are now frequently described as Artisan cottages, regardless of their origin. Joseph Howley, a member of the Irish Volunteers in Galway, was shot dead by a special unit of the RIC known as the Igoe Gang at the station on 4 December 1920 during the Irish War of Independence. =Closure= The station was closed to public traffic on 18 January 1937 with MGWR services redirected to Westland Row (Pearse). While the old MGWR main line was able to access the Dublin loop line to Amiens Street via the North Liffey line Newcomen Bridge junction this was not available to heavier engines such as the Woolwich Moguls due to weight restrictions over the lifting bridge over the Royal Canal. The alternative route via the Drumcondra link line would have required reversals to the Glasnevin and Drumcondra junctions so the connecting line also remodeled at the same time to allow direct through running. The associated complex was finally closed on 8 April 1961, having been used as the steam depot for Dublin between 1937 and this date. This building was one of Dublin's six original rail termini, the others being Westland Row (now Pearse Station) Amiens Street (now Connolly Station), Kingsbridge (now Heuston Station), North Wall and Harcourt Street (now a bar and nightclub complex). Location Situated at the crest of Constitution Hill directly opposite King's Inns, the station served as the finishing point of the Midland and Great Western Railway. Luas Broadstone is a Luas stop on the LUAS Cross City Line between Broombridge and St.Stephen's Green. Work on building the line commenced in June 2013 and services began on 9 December 2017. The stop has lateral platforms and is located adjacent to the south front of the old Broadstone station building with access from Constitution Hill. The stop is called Broadstone-DIT because of its location near to DIT Grangegorman Campus. The LUAS line from central Dublin approaches via Domininck Street Upper and continues by curling round the western edge of the MGWR Broadstone site before re-joining the track of the old main line at the north of the site. =Failed proposal re use for heavy rail= In April 2007 Iarnr√≥d √âireann announced that Broadstone Station was to be reopened for rail passenger use by 2010. This gave rise to a dispute between CIE/Irish Rail and the RPA over the use of the trackbed between Broadstone and Liffey Junction. On 5 February 2008 Noel Dempsey, the Minister for Transport, indicated his preference for the Luas project over the re-opening of Broadstone for heavy rail, asking CI√â to seek permanent planning permission to build and use Docklands Station for the purposes CI√â intended for Broadstone Station.

Service The 17th Michigan Infantry was organized at Detroit, Michigan, between August 8 and 22, 1862. Most of the soldiers in the regiment were from south-central Michigan, and Company E was composed largely of students from Michigan State Normal College, today known as Eastern Michigan University. Due to the large number of students in its ranks, Company E acquired the nickname \\"Normal Company\\". They trained at Fort Wayne under their first commander, Colonel William H. Withington, until August 27 when they left for Maryland. At the Battle of South Mountain, Maryland, on September 14, 1862, the regiment saw its first major action. Although they took heavy casualties, the 17th performed well for an untried unit and earned the nickname \\"Stonewall Regiment\\". Three days later, they participated in the Battle of Antietam as part of the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, IX Corps. After the battle, the regiment left with its command and returned to Virginia. In October 1863, the regiment was assigned to the Army of the Tennessee. On October 14, 1863, the regiment, then attached to the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, IX Corps, marched from Knoxville to Loudon, Tennessee, to oppose the advance of the Confederate General James Longstreet. It lay under its arms during the night, and on the following morning commenced falling back closely followed by the Confederates. It continued to retreat, acting as a rear guard for the rest of the corps. While crossing Turkey Creek, Longstreet's men attacked in force, causing a severe engagement to occur. In this action, the regiment lost 7 men killed, 19 wounded and 10 missing. During the retreat to Knoxville and during the siege the men suffered greatly, especially while being besieged from the want of proper and sufficient rations. When the siege was lifted by the retreating Confederates, the 17th was ordered to Annapolis, Maryland, where 200 new recruits were incorporated into its ranks. From Annapolis, the regiment set out with Ulysses S. Grant's campaign of 1864; when in May of that year it lost 7 men killed, and 39 wounded in the Battle of the Wilderness. On May 12, 1864, the 17th Michigan was actively engaged in the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, and charged the southern Confederate works at Spotsylvania Court House. In this charge the regiment lost 23 killed, 73 wounded and 93 taken prisoner. The loss in prisoners was owing to the regiment being surrounded by a greatly superior force under the command of Longstreet. On May 16, 1864, the regiment was designated as an engineer unit, and served in that capacity the remainder of the year. It moved with its corps from the North Anna River, thence to Cold Harbor, across the Chickahominy and the James Rivers to the Siege of Petersburg, where it remained until the city fell. From the time it arrived in front of Petersburg until its fall, the Regiment was actively building and reconstructing fortifications, all the while being held in reserve, if needed as infantry. After Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House, the regiment proceeded to Washington, D.C. to participate in the Grand Review, remaining there until June 3, 1865, when it was mustered out of service and started for Detroit, arriving there on June 7, 1865, to be paid off and disbanded. Recognition and honors Eight men from the regiment were awarded the Medal of Honor: * Private Frederick Alber, Company A, Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, May 12, 1864 * Private Joseph E. Brandle, Company C, Lenoire Station, Tennessee, November 16, 1863 * Corporal John A. Falconer, Company A, Fort Sanders, Knoxville, Tennessee, November 20, 1863 * Private Andrew J.

Total strength and casualties The regiment had an initial enlistment of 1,079 officers and enlisted men. The regiment suffered 7 officers and 128 enlisted men who were killed in action or mortally wounded and 154 enlisted men who died of disease, for a total of 289 fatalities, or just over one-quarter (25.8%) of its initial strength.

The ship was commissioned at the Port of Mobile, Alabama on 4 June 2011.Griggs, Travis, \\"Destroyer Lawrence commissioned in Mobile\\", Military Times, 5 June 2011. Ship history William P. Lawrence departed Naval Station San Diego, California, on 14 January 2013 for her first overseas deployment as part of a four-ship surface action group from Carrier Strike Group 11. On 1 March 2013, William P. Lawrence entered the Persian Gulf for operations with Carrier Strike Group 3. On 11 March 2013, the ship rendered assistance to a burning vessel while operating in the Strait of Hormuz. and In April 2013, on two separate occasions, William P. Lawrence joined the in rendering assistance to civilian mariners in distress while operating in the Gulf of Oman as part of Combined Task Force 150. Starting 2 September 2013, William P. Lawrence began operating in the Red Sea as part of Carrier Strike Group 11. On 22 September 2013, a large wave hit a helicopter and pushed it into the Red Sea shortly after landing on William P. Lawrence, resulting in the death of two pilots. The vessel was moving at flank speeds to relieve another escort ship in a defensive screen around Carrier Strike Group 3 in U.S. Central Command. The wave came over the starboard side of the flight deck and struck the helicopter less than ten minutes after landing and being chocked and chained (red deck), with rotors still spinning. The other three aircrew members were rescued. On 10 May 2016, the US Navy reported that the ship sailed close to the Fiery Cross Reef as part of a planned series of Freedom of navigation operations (also referred to as FONOPs) in the area. The operation prompted the PRC to express \\"dissatisfaction and opposition\\"; a Pentagon spokesperson said that the operation was undertaken to challenge the \\"excessive maritime claims by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam which were seeking to restrict navigation rights in the South China Sea.\\" In 2016 the ship is part of Destroyer Squadron 21.http://www.public.navy.mil/surfor/cds21/Pages/default.aspx#.VuH0btBrMSE =Deployments= *Maiden deployment (24 January 2013 - 8 November 2013) Notes References External links * *Mobile, Alabama announces commissioning ceremony * Category:Arleigh Burke-class destroyers Category:Ships built in Pascagoula, Mississippi Category:2009 ships ","title":"USS William P.

Hosts and Symptoms  Hosts and symptoms are crucial to know when trying to identify a pathogen of disease. In order for the pathogen to be identified, its common hosts and key symptoms must be accessible. The primary hosts of Hymenochaete corrugata are broad-leaved trees, primarily hazel and willow. The disease is called glue crust and stems from the pathogen's habit of moving across trees and gluing together twigs and branches that are in contact with each other. Common symptoms are an uneven surface caused by setae (surface hairs) and a grey or brown surface tinted lilac on the tree bark. The main sign is the presence of white fruiting bodies that form crusts attached to the trees, typically on the bark of the trunk. Setae can also be seen on the tree bark in the trunk and branches. These fruiting bodies develop cracks over time.  Environment  This disease is primarily localized to Great Britain, Ireland, mainland Europe, and parts of North America. The growing season in Europe is summer and fall. The disease development and spread is favored in woodland areas, primarily Acidophilous Quercus-dominated woodland and broadleaved deciduous woodlands. These woodland environments typically consist of summer-green non-coniferous trees and evergreen trees. These conditions are a temperate climate and are in areas with distinct seasons that make for moderate temperatures due to common rainfall.  Pathogenesis  Regarding the pathogenesis, glue crust essentially glues dead twigs to living branches in the canopy, which prevents the dead twigs from falling to the ground. If they fell to the ground, they would be available to be decomposed by other fungi. Hymenochaete corruguta‚Äôs individual genotypes can accomplish this gluing by making sclerotized mycelial pads that form a bridge binding the twigs together from various stools. The pads created can also allow for attachment to other trees, not just twigs in the same tree. The fungus essentially can go back and forth between different modes of mycelial development and producing melanized pseudosclerotial plates, and then spreads from branch to branch through these glued together pseudosclerotia.

It is intended to serve as the central station for northern and eastern Barcelona, with Sants serving as the central station for southern and western Barcelona. Together with and Sants, currently the only high-speed rail stations in the Barcelona area, it will be on the Madrid‚ÄìBarcelona high-speed rail line. It will also be on the conventional Barcelona‚ÄìCerb√®re and Barcelona‚ÄìMatar√≥‚ÄìMa√ßanet-Massanes railways. Once fully completed, it will be a major public transport hub, with dedicated stations on Barcelona Metro lines 4 and 9/10, as well as a bus station. The complex will be fully underground excepting for the station building, with two levels of platforms, accounting for a total of 18 railway tracks.Juli√† Sort (2013), p. 117‚Äì119 The new station is part of a larger urban redevelopment project along the corridor formed by the railways accessing Barcelona from the north-east, which divides the districts of Sant Andreu and Sant Mart√≠. This project includes the rebuilding of Sant Andreu Comtal railway station, to the north of Sagrera, and the construction of a linear artificial park over the railways running on the corridor, which will be put underground. At an estimated cost of ‚Ç¨2 billion, the project is funded and managed by Barcelona Sagrera Alta Velocitat (BSAV), a public partnership made up of the Spanish Ministry of Public Works and Transport, the Government of Catalonia and the Barcelona City Council. The idea of a new central station at this location has appeared on local transport projects since the late 1960s. Before being demolished in 2007 with the start of the previous works to the construction of the new station, a major goods station on the Barcelona‚ÄìCerb√®re railway, built between 1918 and 1922, had operated at the location. The groundbreaking ceremony for the new station took place on 21 June 2010, when the completion date was set for 2016. In July 2011, a Roman villa was found due to the station construction works. The Spanish Ministry of Public Works and Transport and the City Council announced in July 2013 that they had reached an agreement to modify the original project in order to reduce its cost. In June 2016, it was disclosed that the station works have remained suspended since early 2014 due to a corruption scandal involving one of the companies carrying out the works. Barcelona Metro stations The future Sagrera railway station will be served by lines 4 and 9/10 of the Barcelona Metro. The metro stations will be located parallel to each other, sharing the same hall, on the Sant Andreu district side, to the north-west of the station building. They will be almost level with the lower level of platforms, which will be served by Rodalies de Catalunya commuter and regional rail services. The metro station complex appears on the construction project as Sagrera TAV, where TAV stands for (Catalan for \\"High-Speed Train\\").

While the state itself was far removed from the combat theaters of the war, Michigan supplied many troops and several generals, including George Armstrong Custer. When, at the beginning of the war, Michigan was asked to supply no more than one regiment, Governor Austin Blair sent seven. Before the war Before the Civil War, President James Buchanan took a weak position amid a looming South secession crisis.Rubenstein & Kiewacz, p. 103. Secretary of State Lewis Cass of Michigan, a 78-year-old elder statesman who had been Michigan's U.S. senator and governor of Michigan Territory, resigned from Buchanan's cabinet in protest, remarking that \\"he had seen the Constitution born and now feared he was seeing it die\\". In December 1860, South Carolina became the first state to secede from the Union. Outgoing Governor Moses Wisner delivered a speech to a Michigan Legislature in defense of the Union and the Constitution, stating: \\"This is no time for timid and vacillating councils, when the cry of treason and rebellion is ringing in our ears.\\" On January 2, 1861, Austin Blair was sworn in as governor, vowing strong action to maintain the Union and punish secession. The Legislature was also firmly pro-Union; when Virginia invited Michigan to send delegates to the Washington Peace Conference, the Legislature passed a refusal resolution stating that \\"concessions and compromise are not to be entertained or offered to traitors.\\" Military contribution At the beginning of the Civil War, regiments from Michigan were raised to answer Lincoln's call for men.Michigan Encyclopedia (Vol. 1, 2008‚Äì09 ed.), eds. Matthew L. Daly, Jennifer L. Herman & Caryn Hannan, p. 82, 58. The first volunteers from Michigan were mustered into the Army as the 1st Michigan Infantry on May 1, 1861.Rubenstein & Kiewacz, p. 104. On May 16, the regiment arrived in Washington; Lincoln was said to have exclaimed \\"Thank God for Michigan!\\" upon the troops' arrival. Over the course of the war, some 90,000 Michigan men (about 23 percent of the 1860 male population of the state) served in the Union forces. This figure includes some 1,600 black soldiers. Michigan raised a total of 30 infantry regiments, eleven cavalry regiments, one light artillery regiment, two light batteries, two companies of sharpshooters, and the 1st Michigan Engineers.J. Worth Carnahan, Manual of the Civil War and Key to the Grand Army of the Republic and Kindred Societies (rev. ed. 1897), p. 84. According to Frederick H. Dyer, a total of 14,753 officers and men from Michigan died during the war, but a \\"Roll of Honor\\" prepared upon order of the Michigan Legislature in 1869 contains 14,855 names.Michigan and the Civil War Years, 1860‚Äì1866: A Wartime Chronicle (Michigan Civil War Centennial Observance Commission, 1964), p. 77. Among the more celebrated units was the 24th Michigan Volunteer Infantry, which, as a part of the famed Iron Brigade, suffered considerable losses at the Battle of Gettysburg while defending McPherson's Ridge. George Armstrong Custer's \\"Michigan Wolverine\\" Cavalry effectively battled J.E.B. Stuart at Gettysburg on the East Cavalry Field. Several Union generals hailed from Michigan, including: Custer, Elon J. Farnsworth, Byron Root Pierce, Orlando Metcalfe Poe, Israel Bush Richardson, and Orlando B. Willcox. In a letter to his wife, one Union soldier from Michigan detailed his motivations for fighting for the U.S. in the war, before dying in 1864: Casualties 14,753 Michigan soldiers died in service, roughly one of every six who served. A total of 4,448 of these deaths were combat deaths while the rest, over 10,000, were from disease, a constant fear in crowded army camps with poor food, sanitation and exposure issues and pre-modern medicine. Michigan suffered the sixth-highest losses among the Union states (the non-state U.S. Colored Troops losses also exceeded Michigan's). Homefront Michigan actively participated in the American Civil War sending thousands of volunteers.Robert E., Mitchell, \\"Civil War Recruiting and Recruits from Ever-Changing Labor Pools: Midland County, Michigan, as a Case Study,\\" Michigan Historical Review, 35 (Spring 2009), 29‚Äì60. A study of the cities of Grand Rapids and Niles shows an overwhelming surge of nationalism in 1861, whipping up enthusiasm for the war in all segments of society, and all political, religious, ethnic, and occupational groups. However, by 1862 the casualties were mounting and the war was increasingly focused on freeing the slaves in addition to preserving the Union. Copperhead Democrats called the war a failure, and although it was attempted to make support for the war more and more a partisan Republican effort, the election of 1864 showed support for the Federal cause remained strong.

Its southern terminus is at PA 711 in Oak Grove in Ligonier Township, and its northern terminus is at U.S. Route 219 (US 219) in Northern Cambria. The route was designated on May 27, 1935 in coordination with the release of a new state road map. The easy grade section of the highway in Johnstown is notorious for the many rockslides that occur on the hillside above the road. PennDOT conducted explosive blasting on the hillside in January 2008 in an effort to bring down rocks and permanently correct the rockslide problem. Route description PA 271 begins at an intersection with PA 711 in Ligonier Township, Westmoreland County, heading east on two-lane undivided Menoher Highway. The road heads through wooded areas with some small fields and rural homes. The route continues east-northeast, entering Fairfield Township as it heads into forested areas and crosses Laurel Hill. The road heads east and passes along the northern border of Laurel Ridge State Park. PA 271 enters Conemaugh Township in Somerset County and heads northeast for through more forested areas near the state park. The route crosses into Upper Yoder Township in Cambria County and becomes Menoher Boulevard, leaving Laurel Ridge State Park and heading through more forests. The road turns northeast and winds through more wooded areas with some fields and homes. PA 271 heads into the borough of Westmont and turns east into residential areas. The route crosses into the borough of Southmont and turns southeast running between developed areas to the southwest and Grandview Cemetery to the northeast as a three-lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes. The road curves northeast into wooded areas and crosses into the city of Johnstown, heading north-northwest past more homes as a two-lane road. PA 271 turns east- northeast onto the city-maintained Haynes Street and passes under the PA 56 freeway, crossing PA 403 and heading into commercial areas. The route crosses Stonycreek River and turns north onto Bedford Street, which heads south to provide access to and from eastbound PA 56. State maintenance of the route resumes and PA 271 heads north into downtown Johnstown. It later turns northeast onto Clinton Street. The road crosses CSX's S&C; Subdivision railroad line and heads between industrial areas to the northwest and residential areas to the southeast, crossing a LVRJ railroad line twice. The route turns north onto Phoebe Court and crosses another LVRJ line and the Little Conemaugh River before turning northeast onto Maple Avenue. PA 271 heads through residential and industrial areas, heading over another railroad line and the Little Conemaugh River into the borough of Franklin. Here, the road becomes Locust Street and heads between the river to the northwest and industrial areas to the southeast, turning southeast to pass over a LVRJ line. The route turns northeast onto Main Street and runs through the downtown area before turning northwest onto Franklin Street and coming to a bridge over the railroad line and the Little Conemaugh River. At this point, PA 271 enters the borough of East Conemaugh and becomes Main Street, crossing over Norfolk Southern's Pittsburgh Line before running through the commercial downtown. The route heads into residential areas and turns northeast onto 2nd Street, passing more homes. PA 271 turns north-northeast onto Parkhill Drive, heading into wooded areas and crossing into East Taylor Township.

Background Bred by E. P. Taylor at his Windfields Farm in Oshawa, Ontario, Northern Taste was out of the mare Lady Victoria, a daughter of Canadian Hall of Fame inductee, Victoria Park. His sire was the Canadian and U.S. Racing Hall of Fame star, Northern Dancer, whom the NTRA calls \\"one of the most influential sires in Thoroughbred history.\\" Northern Taste was part of Windfields Farm's 1972 consignment of yearlings at the annual Saratoga yearling sale. He was purchased for US$100,000 by Teruya Yoshida for his father Zenya Yoshida, a Japanese racehorse owner/breeder who operated Shadai Farm in Shiraoi, Hokkaido. His new owner decided to race the colt in France and turned him over to trainer John Cunnington, Jr. at the Great Stables in Chantilly. Racing career Racing at age two, Northern Taste won the Prix Thomas Bryon at Saint-Cloud Racecourse and the Prix Eclipse at Maisons- Laffitte Racecourse where the following April 1974 he would return to win the Prix Djebel. Sent to compete in the 1974 English Classics, Northern Taste finished fourth in the 2,000 Guineas and fifth in The Derby. Back in France, he ran third in the Prix Eug√®ne Adam and in September finished second in the Group I Prix du Moulin de Longchamp at Longchamp Racecourse before winning the G1 Prix de la For√™t in October. He returned to the track in 1975 at age four, winning the Group III Prix du Pin in the Fall at Longchamp. Stud record Retired from racing, Northern Taste was brought to Japan to stand at stud at his owner's breeding farm. His owner described him as a calm and healthy horse who rarely caught a cold or suffered from any of the intestinal problems common to Thoroughbreds. Northern Taste became one of the most important stallions in the history of Japanese horse breeding, especially in late 1980s to early 1990s. His success as a stallion made the Yoshida family breeding business into the largest and most successful in the history of Japan with the largest number of broodmares of any breeder in the world. Northern Taste set a record for having sired the most race winners in Japan Racing Association history with 1,754 (later beaten by Sunday Silence), and he substantially influenced the quality of the Japanese industry's bloodstock. He was the Leading sire in Japan for ten of the eleven years between 1982 and 1992 and also headed the broodmare sires list a number of times. His offspring proved successful at both medium and longer distances and were winners of 92 graded stakes races. Among his progeny were Amber Shadai, winner of the 1983 Autumn Tenno Sho; Dyna Carle, who won the 1983 Yushun Himba (Japanese Oaks); 1986 Tokyo Yushun champion Dyna Gulliver; plus Champion Older Mare Dyna Actress and the 1990 Champion 2-year-old filly of Japan, Northern Driver. The last sire of Northern Taste's progeny in Japan has been retired in 2010. However, the broodmares' line would still be in active. Northern Taste was retired from stud duty in 1999 and died at the age of 33 on December 11, 2004. His owners acquired Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, and Breeders' Cup Classic winner Sunday Silence to carry on for Northern Taste, and he too topped Japan's sire list from 1995 through 2005. In 1980, Zenya Yoshida purchased Real Shadai, who became the leading sire in Japan in 1993. In the 1990s, the Yoshida family also purchased the Italian star and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Tony Bin for US$4 million and Epsom Derby winner Dr. Devious for US$6 million. In September 2002, they paid US$17.7 million for the stallion War Emblem.

History The origins of the school lie in the charities established in the late 18th century to clothe and educate the sons of Freemasons near their homes. These charities amalgamated in 1852 and established a boys' school at Wood Green in North London in 1857. The foundation stone for a new school in Bushey was laid by the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. It was designed by Gordon & Gunton and completed in 1903. A Junior School was added on the other side of The Avenue in 1929 and by 1939 there were 800 boys at the school. Following a decline in pupil numbers the junior school closed in 1970, with the senior school closing in 1977. The site of the junior school is now occupied by The Grange Academy. The Royal Masonic School for Girls, based at Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, was unaffected by the closure. The site was acquired by Comer Homes in 1998: the buildings were rented out to the United States International University (Europe) until 2009 when Comer Homes began redeveloping the site as Royal Connaught Park.

In 1982 a new product line was created: the Printed Gaskets Division, launched under the name of Egaprint, contributing with sealing solutions to a large range of products and markets. Seven years later, a new activity was launched: HMI Division (Human‚Äìmachine interface), manufacturing graphic overlays, membrane switches and, later on, metal (anti-vandalism) keyboards. At that time there were about 210 workers on the cooperative staff. At the end of the 1990s, a new domestic appliances component was launched: an air-to-air, heat transfer, water condenser for tumble dryers. In 2006, Embega first subsidiary was established in Poland, due to their position in the white goods market, under the name of Embega Polska, which started its activity in Wroclaw by producing domestic appliance components. In 2008 a new cooperative was established in which Embega took an important share: Soterna, a manufacturer of domestic solar systems. A new product line, natural evolution of membrane switches was started early in 2013: flexible, backlighted, capacitive buttons and keyboards within the HMI division.

Flag, trophy of the Winter War In ancient Greece and ancient Rome, military victories were commemorated with a display of captured arms and standards. A trophy (from the Greek tropaion) was originally a war memorial assembled from such items on a battlefield. The Roman triumph also displayed these items as well as cultural objects, which later came to be called war trophies. Body parts of slain enemies have sometimes served as trophies since antiquity, in a practice called human trophy collecting. The recovery of Roman eagles taken as trophies by enemy forces sometimes inspired years of added warfare. 71st Regiment of Foot colours captured by the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata troops during the first British invasion in 1806 and exhibited as a war trophy at the Santo Domingo convent, in Buenos Aires. In more recent times, it has been common for soldiers to return home with souvenirs, such as enemy weapons and flags, while larger military items captured in battle, particularly weaponry such as machine guns and artillery pieces, became the property of the state to which the soldiers responsible for the capture belonged. In the 20th century, the victorious alliance states removed large quantities of property, including cultural objects. After the First World War, the Treaty of Versailles authorized the removal of large amounts of property from Germany, which it termed \\"reparations\\". After the Second World War, the Potsdam Conference authorized the removal of certain property from Germany, such as the merchant marine fleet. Germany, during the war, had removed large quantities of property from the countries that it had occupied. In some cases, for example the Soviet \\"trophy brigades\\", official looting was euphemised as the taking of \\"trophies\\".  Cultural objects  Article 56 of the Hague Convention of 1907, stated: However, the article was not much respected during the remainder of the century. In 1954, a further convention was signed at the Hague: Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, and two protocols have strengthened its force. Many works of art moved from their pre-war locations during the turmoils of the 20th century. UNESCO, the United Nations agency responsible for culture has been seeking to resolve issues relating to cultural objects displaced in connection with the Second World War. However, the conference in Spring 2007 failed to reach a consensus on a draft non-binding declaration.

Geographically, it is relatively flat and has the River Kennet, a tributary of the River Lark locally known as the Lee Brook, cutting through the centre of the village. The parish's boundary forms, on its west and south sides, the boundary between Cambridgeshire and Suffolk. The village's name is listed as \\"Frekeham\\" in 895, and appears in the Domesday Book as \\"Frakenaham\\". The name is believed to mean \\"homestead of a man called Freca\\", or derive from frecena a Saxon word meaning \\"the home of strong men or warriors\\". History The parish of Freckenham has been inhabited since neolithic times; a flint axe was unearthed in the village in 1884. With fens on three sides, early residents completed their defense by raising earthworks that are believed to have originally reached perhaps twenty feet in height. The remains can still be found in the field by the church, and Beacon Mound that was used to relay messages in medieval times was added as part of them in c.14th century. The hoard of around 90 Iron Age gold coins dating from about AD 20 that was found in the area of Mortimer's Lane suggests that the village lay within the territory of the Iceni tribe. Many of these well-preserved coins are now housed in the British Museum. It is probable that Romans also occupied the area, and the celebrated Mildenhall Treasure were found only a few miles away. During the Dark Ages the village may well have witnessed any of the many Saxon raids on the region and may be the origin of the many bones buried near the church. The first written record of the village dates from 896 when Alfred the Great gave \\"Freckenham in the County of Suffolk and my small estate in Yselham (Isleham)\\" to Burricus, Bishop of Rochester. In the tenth century the conquering Vikings sold the village, but it was restored to Rochester only to be lost again when Sweyn Forkbeard invaded and is believed to have destroyed the village's castle, of which only the motte mound remains. When the Vikings were finally expelled in 1046 the parish passed to Harold Godwinson and in 1066 to Odo of Bayeux brother of William the Conqueror. When Odo fell from favour, the village once again became the property of the Bishop of Rochester and remained in his property with only minor interruptions until in 1537, it was sold to Sir Ralph Warren, twice Lord Mayor of London. The draining of The Fens in the late 17th century radically changed the region, removing the fishing industry that dominated the area. The village folk thus turned their attention to farming the newly drained land and the primary industry has been arable farming in the centuries since. Church It is likely that a place of Christian worship has existed on the site of the present church since the third century, though no archaeological trace remains. Work on the present church began in around 1195 and the chancel dates from this time. The nave was added in the 14th century, and a tower was built in around 1475, though largely collapsed in 1882, being restored soon after in its original style. The original thatched roof was tiled in 1866. The carved pew ends are noted and there is an alabaster plaque dedicated to Saint Eloi a patron saint of blacksmiths. The five bells date from between 1623 and 1809. The church is dedicated to Saint Andrew, and has been in the patronage of Peterhouse, Cambridge since 1760, the college's first. There is also a 1281 reference to the \\"Chappell of the Blessed Mary\\", indicating that the village was of sufficient size to merit a second place of worship. Village life Due to a low population it contains limited facilities, but these include a 16th-century pub, The Golden Boar, a church, and a village hall. Children in the area attend schools in neighbouring villages and towns.  Lords of the Manor  Signpost in Freckenham The Bishops of Rochester have been Lords of the Manor from the time King Alfred gave the property to Burricus. In 1537, Bishop John conveyed the manor to Sir Ralph Warren and his wife Christina. Sir Ralph was Lord Mayor of London and he appointed Edward Crome and Nicholas Wilson as his Trustees. Joan, daughter to Sir Ralph, married Sir Henry Cromwell. His son and heir, Sir Oliver Cromwell, alienated the manor in 1600 to Sir Stephen Soame. He died in 1619 and was succeeded by his son Sir Thomas Soame. Sir Thomas, who was knighted by King Charles I of England in 1641, had been Sheriff of London in 1635, and MP briefly in the Short Parliament (April‚ÄìMay 1640), and then in the Long Parliament from 1641. He was Alderman for Ventry and then of Cheap from 1640 to 1651, when he was deprived by the republican government. He was reinstated in 1660 on the Restoration of King Charles II of England. He died in 1670, aged 88. The manor appears to have devolved on his two daughters (?) Bridget, married to Robert Russell of Freckenham, and Cicely, who re-married as her second husband Thomas Cage. She conveyed her share of the Lordship to her brother-in-law Robert Russell. Meanwhile, she directed her executors to give ¬£500 to her son, Seckford Cage. The law then was that a wife's property became her husband's on their marriage and, consequently, Thomas Cage refused to make the transfer. Seckford Cage took his father to Chancery Division and sued him for the money, which was granted by the Court in 1680. Robert Russell sold the manor to Sir Samuel Clarke, who was created a Baronet in 1698. He came from Snailwell, Cambridgeshire, and married Mary, daughter of Major Robert Thompson, of Newington Green, Middlesex (North London). Sir Samuel died in 1719. He was succeeded at Freckenham by his son, Sir Robert, 2nd Baronet who represented Cambridge in Parliament in 1717. A younger son Samuel died in his father's lifetime, but there were three daughters, Mary, the third, being important for our descent of the Lordship. She married Arthur Barnardiston, youngest son of Sir Nathaniel Barnardiston, 23rd in lineal descent of his family. Sir Robert died in 1746, and was succeeded as 3rd Baronet by his son, Sir Samuel Clarke, who died in 1753. The Baronetcy and the Lordship passed to his brother, Sir Robert, who died in 1770. The last in the male line of the Clarkes was Sir Arthur, the 6th Baronet, who died in 1806 without issue. At this point, the entail of the 2nd Baronet's Will came into action again and the Lordship of Freckenham became the property of Nathaniel Barnardiston, the son of Arthur Barnardiston and Mary Clarke. Since that time the Barnardiston Family have owned the Manor passing it to rightful heirs for more than two centuries until recently, when Nathaniel Geoffrey Barnardiston, great great nephew of Major- General Nathaniel Walter Barnardiston, Commander in the Siege of Tsingtao, and son of Colonel Nathaniel Montague Barnardiston passed the Lordship to Datu Sadja Matthew Pajares Yngson, DCPS KCR FRSA, from Dominica and the Philippines, who is a Commercial Diplomat and ambassador and Secretary-General of the Sultanate of Sulu. He is the first Lord of non-English descent.

He followed his father as a member of parliament and leader of the Repeal Association. Life Educated at Clongowes Wood College, Trinity College Dublin, and the King's Inns, O'Connell was then called to the bar, but did not practice.John O‚ÄôConnell at Ricorso He served in the United Kingdom Parliament as Member of Parliament for Youghal from 1832 to 1837, for Athlone from 1837‚Äì1841, for Kilkenny from 1841‚Äì1847, for Limerick from 1847‚Äì1851 and for Clonmel from 1853‚Äì1857. In 1843, O'Connell was tried with his father in the State Trials, and was imprisoned in Richmond prison before being released the next year by an order of the House of Lords. During his father's declining years, he was the dominant force in the Repeal Association and denounced Young Ireland as irreligious and lawless. In 1847, he closed down Conciliation Hall, and in 1848 reacted to the Rising by establishing closer links with the government. Of Daniel's four sons, he was considered to be the only one who inherited something of his father's political skill: he was nicknamed \\"The Young Liberator\\", although critics claimed he did little to justify the title. In 1851, he took part in the downfall of Lord John Russell and the Whigs from government. After being censured by his constituency, he resigned his seat by taking the Chiltern Hundreds. He opposed the Tenant Right League and was subsequently elected as member for Clonmel in 1853, after which he accepted a sinecure position as Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper at Dublin Castle. O'Connell was not an impressive public speaker, but wrote political works for the Repeal Association. His brothers Maurice, Morgan and Daniel were also members of parliament.

Journal of Cleaner Production 2005;13:971-9 Definition There is no official definition for DE, but it could be described as a regional approach to promote innovation by small and medium- sized enterprises, as well as sustainable development. The concept is illustrated in the figure below, that shows centralised, decentralised and distributed economies respectively. thumb Features The relations in DE are much more complex than those in a centralised economy. This feature makes the whole economy more stable ‚Äì leaf nodes no longer rely on just one central node. It also resembles ecological networks, making it a good practical example of industrial ecology. A big advantage of DE is that it enables entities within the network to work much more with regional/local natural resources, finances, human capital, knowledge, technology, and so on. It also makes the entities more flexible to respond to the local market needs and thus generating a bigger innovation drive. By doing this, they become a better reflection of their social environment and in that way they can improve quality of life. The whole concept of DE is not at all a new invention ‚Äì this is how most pre-industrial economies were organised. However, information technology has opened new doors for the concept: information can be shared much more easily and small-scale production facilities (rapid prototyping) are becoming cheaper.New York Times - Beam It Down From the Web, Scotty The DE concept works well with the development of fab labs. Not all industries are fit for DE; for example, many chemical processes only become economically feasible & efficient on a large scale.

The National Park Service designated El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail as a unit in the National Trails System in 2004. The modern highways Texas 21 (along with Texas OSR) and Louisiana 6 roughly follow the original route of the trail. History El Camino Real de los Tejas routes in Spanish Texas Alonso de Le√≥n, Spanish governor of Coahuila, established the corridor for what became El Camino Real de los Tejas in multiple expeditions to East Texas between 1686 and 1690 to find and destroy a French fort established by Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle on what de Le√≥n considered to be Spanish lands. The route was refined in 1691-1692 by Domingo Ter√°n de los R√≠os, the first governor of Spanish Texas, in an effort to make better connections to the Spanish missions in East Texas. San Antonio de Bexar, founded in 1718, was the first of many communities built as way stations on the trail. After Mexico achieved independence from Spain in 1821, immigrants from the American colonies invited to Texas used the corridor to travel to their settlements. A section of the road called Camino Arriba by the Spanish became known as the Old San Antonio Road. The growth of towns such as Austin, Galveston, and Houston not on the original route, along with the building of railroads, changed the direction of travel and trade and the use of El Camino Real de los Tejas diminished. Route The historic trail ran from the capitol and central Viceroyalty of New Spain ‚Äî present day Mexico City ‚Äî winding through Saltillo, Monterrey, Laredo (on the modern Texas border), San Antonio, and Nacogdoches, before reaching the Louisiana border at the Sabine River. The river crossing was a ferry, in use since around 1795, as the Chabanan Ferry. James Taylor Gaines purchased the ferry in 1819, and it became known as the Gaines Ferry. Gaines sold the ferry in 1843 and at some point it began to be called Pendleton's Ferry.GAINES FERRY,\\" Handbook of Texas Online, accessed April 22, 2013. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. The ferry remained in service until being replaced by the Gaines-Pendleton Bridge in 1937. Cotulla in La Salle County in South Texas After crossing the river, the trail went through the Neutral Strip and Many, Louisiana, before ending at Natchitoches in modern Louisiana. The trail has a 2,500-mile length. For centuries, the Native Americans had used the trail routes for trading between the Great Plains and Chihuahuan Desert regions and essentially created the road. El Camino Real de Los Tejas was first followed and marked by Spanish explorers and missionaries in the 1700s. It was one of several named El Camino Real, or \\"Royal Road\\", that connected the Spanish possessions in North America with Mexico City. Preservation Interest in the road revived in the early 20th century. In 1915, the Texas Legislature appropriated $5,000 to survey and mark the route, and professional surveyor V. N. Zivley was commissioned to make the study. A few years later, the Daughters of the American Revolution placed granite milestones every 5 miles along the route to mark it. In October 2004, President George W. Bush signed into law El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail. The National Park Service started planning for El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail in 2006 with a comprehensive management plan.

However, the poem was published in the November 1857 issue of the The Atlantic. Emerson, R., & Von Frank, A. (2016). Ralph Waldo Emerson : the major poetry . The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. It is named for Brahman, the universal principlehttp://hinduism.about.com/od/basics/a/brahman.htm of the Vedas. About Brahma is one of the poems composed by Ralph Waldo Emerson, an American transcendentalist of the nineteenth century. The poem is composed in the form of an utterance- a form which comprises sublime or metaphysical content while adding to it the balladic quatrain-music pattern. (A dramatic form not in vogue, and distinctly different from Browning's dramatic developments). The form, therefore, is the first of its kind to include Oriental poetical material in the Western verse framework. The central speaker of the poem is Brahma Himself, who according to Hindu philosophers of India, is omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent. The study of the vedantic philosophy, the Gita, and the Katha Upanishad is impressed upon the poem very forcefully. Body is for some certain period of time but within the body of man there is the soul that is the divine spark, eternal, everlasting and never- ending. It is a part of the over-soul who is the supreme God, the super power of the universe. The first group of American thinkers who observed the non- western philosophy was the transcendentalists. Emerson was the leader and other prominent members of this group were Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, Alcott and Elizabeth Peabody. Transcendentalism opposed the dogmatic concept of belief and urged to think freely. Transcendentalism has the principle that the answer to man's cause is an acceptance of the final liberation ‚Äì a quality that the biblical religion imposed, and a quality that Hinduism attests as true, ultimately pleasurable and most importantly, to be thought out as a thinking individual- a quality that most appealed Emerson and his decision in giving up his institution of Unitarianism. Different religions have different beliefs about their deity but the core concern of all is the Brahma, the superpower. Thus, the theme of the poem is universal: The Brahma, the superpower, has many little parts atman, the human, who has to achieve salvation (linkage of atman to the Brahma), but entrapped in Maya, transient one, the physical beauty of the world. One who can overcome the Maya will certainly understand the Brahma i.e the achievement of salvation. Brahma is the philosophical explication of the universal spirit by that name. The poetic form of elastic quatrain is used to represent the solemn nature of the subject. Throughout, the poem the Brahma appears as the only speaker, sustaining the continuity of the work. That the spirit is the only speaker signifies not only its absolute nature but also its sustaining power, upon which the existence of entire universe metaphorically, the poem is based.

Among the dead were American singer and actor Kenneth Spencer and Marie-H√©l√®ne Lefaucheux, a women's and human rights activist and member of the French delegation to the United Nations. Sequence of events Flight 304, which had originated in Mexico City, left New Orleans International Airport for Atlanta at 2:01 a.m., Central Standard Time, and disappeared from radar at 2:10 a.m. Visibility was good, although there was a light rain. The winds were calm. The Coast Guard and other searchers sighted the wreckage around dawn in Lake Pontchartrain, about northeast of New Orleans. Investigation The subsequent investigation concluded that the jet crashed into Lake Pontchartrain en route due to \\"degradation of aircraft stability characteristics in turbulence, because of abnormal longitudinal trim component positions.\\" The water was only deep, yet only 60 percent of the wreckage was recovered because the breakup was so extensive. The flight data recorder tape was too damaged to help the investigation. Instead, investigators used the maintenance records of the crashed aircraft and of other DC-8s, to conclude that the pilots had trimmed the horizontal stabilizer to the full nose-down position, to counter the excessive nose-up attitude that, in turn, was caused by a malfunctioning pitch trim compensator that had extended too far. Once the upset occurred, it was not possible to trim the horizontal stabilizer back to the nose-up position, because of the severe G-forces generated by the crew's pulling back on the yoke after the upset.

Reorganization  In 1986, the government gave autonomy to the Postal Service. This was in response to the need to improve the service, which was considered one of the worst in the world and was now facing competition from private companies. In order to compete with the private postal services like DHL, UPS, FedEx, Multipack, Estafeta and others the postal service created a new entity, \\"Mexpost,\\" but more expensive than normal postal service but also more efficient working as a private company but still being part of the Mexican Postal Service.  Recent history  In 2008, President Felipe Calder√≥n ordered the overhaul of Servicio Postal Mexicano and rebranded it as Correos de M√©xico. Along with a new name and new image, created by Carl Forssell, the agency was restructured helping to streamline operations, improve performance, and expand postal outlets to non-traditional locations like private businesses. History Pre-Hispanic precedents can be found in the organization of the Aztecs, who had several types of messengers: the painanis or \\"light feet\\" who transmitted religious messages and designs, the yucicatitlantis who carried urgent data to the metropolis, the tequihuatitlantis or messengers of war, and the tamemes who carried goods from any remote point of the Aztec Empire to Tenochtitlan (as an example, they carried fresh fish daily from Veracruz).Cienfuegos, D. et Guzm√°n, E. ¬´El servicio postal mexicano: historia, regulaci√≥n y perspectivas¬ª. Biblioteca Jur√≠dica Virtual del Instituto de Investigaciones Jur√≠dicas de la UNAM. After the discovery and conquest, the Spanish crown considered it essential to establish communication between the New World and the Iberian Peninsula, to send and receive information between both sides of the Atlantic. To that effect, in 1514 Queen Juana La Loca and in her name Ferdinand the Catholic, her father and regent, created the post of Correo Mayor de las Indias, through a Royal Decree. The correspondence until that moment had been in charge of the Casa de Contrataci√≥n. The new post was created in the image and likeness of the Seville Correo Mayor in the form of a monopoly, which fell to Lorenzo Galindez de Carvajal, the Councillor of Castile, on a perpetual and hereditary basis. Faced with such responsibility and the impossibility of fulfilling the function of distributing the mail coming from the Peninsula to the Indies and vice versa, the system of leasing was used. The holders of these leases, in turn, and by means of powers of attorney, granted permission to those exercising the trade, lieutenants or deputies. After the death of the first owner, the job was transferred from one lessor to another. The position implied the provision of a service and entailed certain privileges or grants; it was developed by a private individual with the supervision and control of the Crown. Just as in Lima and Seville the post of Correo Mayor was a royal donation in perpetuity, which would have required compensation from the Crown if the contract had expired. During the period of the delegation no money was handed over for exercising the office.The first delegate was Diego Daza, who died two years after taking office and who had recommended his collaborator Mart√≠n de Olivares.Gonz√°lez Mart√≠nez, Nelson Fernando. ¬´Corrupciones no probadas: el ¬´fraude¬ª del correo mayor en nueva Espa√±a (1693-1701)¬ª. Historia y Memoria, n¬∫ 19. During the reign of Philip II, and by means of a decree issued on May 31, 1579 at the Aranjuez Palace, Don Mart√≠n de Olivares was named Correo Mayor de Hostas y Postas de la Nueva Espa√±a (Main Post Office of Hostas and Postas of the New Spain), which was given to him by the Viceroy Don Mart√≠n Enr√≠quez de Almansa, on August 27, 1580.Walter Ludovico Bose, ¬´Or√≠genes del correo terrestre en M√©xico. Los Correos Mayores (1579-1765)¬ª. Revista de Historia de Am√©rica, n¬∞ 23 (1947): 55-103 Mart√≠n de Olivares as a replacement practiced the trade for 25 years (1579-1604) with the same system of delegation and without receiving any money for it. At the beginning of the 17th century, when the practice of selling the royal offices in the Indian spaces began to be common, the delegation system changed for an auction system in which a private individual could pay to become a major mailman. To do so, he had to make a guarantee and win the auction proposal. Thus in 1604, the Viceroy Marquis of Montesclaros and the Secretary of New Spain in the Council of the Indies agreed that the post would be sold for 58,000 pesos. After a month of announcements, three candidates presented themselves to the auction, obtaining the position of Correo Mayor Alonso Diez, who was the first person to pay for a post office in the Indies. The Correo Mayor established a system of lieutenants between the different New Spanish territories, in addition the position implied being Mayor of Mexico City. The position was established for life and not in perpetuity as in Peru. From the first auction in 1604, the Correo Mayor of New Spain acquired the category of \\"saleable and resignable\\". The Correo Mayor of New Spain had jurisdiction over a wide territory, from the south of the United States to Guatemala and from Acapulco to Veracruz. Correspondence from (or to) Europe and the Philippines circulated throughout this territory. During the 17th century, when the post was already being sold, it was the Diez de la Barrera (1604-1693) and Xim√©nez de los Cobos (1693-1760) families who served as Correos Mayores in New Spain. Until the end of the seventeenth century, complaints and claims about the \\"Correo Mayor\\" were limited to occasional issues, delays, poor service or lack of security, and during the two centuries in which the post of Correo Mayor was active, none of them were relieved of their responsibility, and they carried out their duties until their death or their resignation.Nelson Fernando Gonz√°lez Mart√≠nez, ¬´De la ‚Äòconfianza‚Äô a las sospechas de corrupci√≥n: las concesiones de Correo Mayor en el mundo Hispanoamericano (1501-1720)¬ª, en Estudios sobre la corrupci√≥n en Espa√±a y Am√©rica (siglos XVI-XVIII), ed. Francisco Gil Mart√≠nez y Amorina Villarreal Brasca (Almer√≠a: Editorial Universidad de Almer√≠a, 2017), 229-52. In 1697, however, the Mayor of New Spain, Pedro Xim√©nez de los Cobos, was accused of defrauding the Royal Treasury, and the denouncer was Jos√© Sarmiento de Valladares, Count of Moctezuma and Viceroy of New Spain. The accusation led to a confrontation between the highest viceregal authority and a member of the political elite born in Mexico City. By then, the post of Mayor allowed him to act as a Mayor with voice and vote of the city where the title had been acquired, which allowed him a real defense. Ximenez de los Cobos lived in the capital of New Spain (Mexico City) and worked with a network of lieutenants. His responsibilities were to guarantee the circulation of official documents within the viceroyalty and to provide sufficient logistics for the overseas mail to transit from the ports of Acapulco and Veracruz to Mexico City and other final destinations. In the most important cities it had a series of lieutenants who developed and guaranteed these missions. The accusation of fraud was widely echoed and the process involved an extensive memorial at the Council of the Indies, but in the end no action was taken against the person involved. The witnesses of the viceroy and the evidence presented were insufficient and this allowed Ximenez de los Cobos to reassert his position, which he abandoned in 1720 after resigning in favor of a relative. The judicial process implied a better administration and organization of the service, and in practice it led to a greater accounting of the trade, a documentary habit that facilitated in 1764 the elaboration of a complete survey of the cost of communication of the viceroyalty, which would be fundamental when addressing the Borbon reforms. The Real y Suprema Junta de Correos, established by Royal Decree of December 20, 1776, was the unique court in the postal area, and any civil or penal litigation, was its concern in any of its territories. With the Bourbon reforms, also the postal services were transformed. In 1794 the Ordenanza General de Correos, Postas y Caminos was promulgated. In 1794, during the mandate of Godoy, the Ordinance developed by his predecessor, the Count of Aranda, was published . This legal body dealt extensively with all aspects related to those in charge, employees and services of the Post Office, both in the peninsula and in all American territories. It also established the functioning of the postal administrations, the estafetas or the Casas de Postas, gathering in this way all the subjects that had arisen throughout the century.Biblioteca Virtual del Patrimonio Bibliogr√°fico. Digital copy of the 1794 ordinance with all its pages In 1812, with the promulgation of the constitution of Cadiz, the Suprema y Real Junta de Correos was removed for being incompatible with the constitutional terms. The administrative issues would be passed to the Direcci√≥n General de Correos and the pending judicial matters to the courts of first instance.Oscar Cruz Barney \\"La Ordenanza de Correos del 8 de junio de 1794 en el M√©xico independiente\\". Instituto de Investigaciones Jur√≠dicas - Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico. With the Independence, part of the regulations of the 1794 Ordinance remained active. As for the post office income, it was in charge of the Secretariat of State and the Universal Office of Internal and External Relations. In 1824 this income and the administration was transferred to the Ministry of Finance. In 1830 the post office was expanded and included other territories, as new lines of communication were opened. In 1842, General Santa Ana reorganized the postal service and the tariff system, and this continued at the Ministry of Finance.Government Decree of October 24, 1842.

The war with the United States disrupted the postal services, and it wasn't until October 31, 1849 when a Regulation on Postal Service Visitors was issued, establishing the obligations of these officials. By Regulation of August 28, 1852, the Post Office was reorganized, maintaining part of the 1794 regulations. The Mexican Constitution of 1857 kept the post office as a State monopoly. In 1856 Mexico embraced the postage system and the use of postal stamps. The first Mexican stamp went into circulation on August 1, 1856 with the portrait of Miguel Hidalgo. Stamps began to be sent on August 29, 1856. The stamp sheets had to bear the stamp of the issuing office to be valid and to avoid fraud.Secretar√≠a de Comunicaciones y Transportes, Memoria 1962- 1963, M√©xico, Textos de la Oficial√≠a Mayor, Secretar√≠a de Comunicaciones y Transportes, 1963 en cfr.

In 1899 a new Postal Code was created. On February 17, 1907, President Porfirio D√≠az founded the \\"Palacio Postal\\" (Postal Palace) also known as the \\"Quinta Casa de Correos\\" (Fifth Postal House). In 1921, Sepomex was in need of an international regulatory and unified postal service, and the Mexican government participated in the formation of the \\"Uni√≥n Panamericana de Correos\\" (Panamerican Postal Union) in Buenos Aires. In 1931, Spain joined the union, which changed the name to \\"Uni√≥n Postal de las Am√©ricas y Espa√±a\\" (American and Spain Postal Union.) In 1990, Portugal was added to the union, which again changed the name to \\"Uni√≥n Postal de las Am√©ricas, Espa√±a y Portugal\\" (American, Spain and Portugal Postal Union). In 1933, by presidential order, the Postal service took control of the telegraph service in Mexico, creating the office \\"Direcci√≥n General de Correos y Telegrafos\\" (Executive Director of Postal Service and Telegraphs). In 1942, the President ordered the separation of the postal service and telegraph into two entities.

By 1990, the company had 1,000 employees, 20 offices, and $55 million in annual revenue. In 1992, the company moved into the customer service business by purchasing Jones Technologies, a call center company based in Sterling, Colorado. In 1993, Sykes relocated its corporate headquarters from Charlotte to Tampa, Florida. Sykes became a publicly traded company in 1996. The company was listed on NASDAQ under the stock symbol SYKE. David Grimes, a former AT&T; executive, was named president of Sykes in 1998. John Sykes remained CEO and chairman. In 2000, Grimes became president and CEO. However, after 3 months, Grimes resigned and Sykes returned as president and CEO. Charles Sykes, John Sykes' son, became president and CEO of the company in 2004.

Production Production of this album is the result of a combination of works by local Malaysian song composers and producers, such as Li Nai Gang (Êùé‰πÉÂàö), Zhang Jue Long (Âº†ËßâÈöÜ), Danny One Li Ming (Ê∏©ÂäõÈì≠), Peng Xue Bin (ÂΩ≠Â≠¶Êñå), Guan Qi Yuan (ÁÆ°ÂêØÊ∫ê) and Azlan Abu Hassan. Out of these six individuals, Danny himself is a local singer and appears alongside Danell in the MV for the song Because of Love Âõ†Áà≤ÊúâÊÑõ, a remake of the former's own song of the same title, except that Daniel sang while Danny rapped. Zhang Jue Long was responsible for writing one of Daniel's well-known hits, I Love To See You Now ÁèæÂú®ÔºåÂæàÊÉ≥Ë¶ã‰Ω†, in his previous album. Guan Qi Yuan is one of the judges in the Malaysian version of Project Superstar (ÁªùÂØπSuperstar), a Mandarin singing talent search competition, known as the most critical of all 5 judges. Daniel was said to have been under pressure during the production of this album, partly he had spent most of his time gap between this album and the previous one in other works, such as guest appearances in concerts and also the idol television drama, Sky ÊòüÁ©∫, produced and shown on Malaysian channel, 8TV ÂÖ´Â∫¶Á©∫Èñì. This has caused him to worry quite a bit as to whether his singing skills had improved since then. Daniel himself confessed that he repeated recording of the songs numerous times before he himself was really satisfied, despite receiving the green light from those in charge of the recording. The cover of the album displays Daniel in a 'yuppie' suit, a reflection of maturity of Daniel in his singing career, thus removing him from his sunny image displayed in his previous album, an indication that he is no longer a newbie in the entertainment industry. Facts Like his previous album, Unavoidable Ë∫≤‰∏çÈÅé is a trilingual album consisting of 8 Mandarin songs, 1 English song and 1 Malay song. The order of the songs according to language is also the same; the English and Malay songs are the 9th and last songs respectively. As before, Daniel re-sings an existing English song and recorded one of the Malay songs he sang during his days in Malaysian Idol 2. No. 1 hit song Because of Love Âõ†Áà≤ÊúâÊÑõ is a remake of Danny Wen Li Ming's song of the same title. Rap lyrics were added. Daniel sang the song while Danny rapped. Unavoidable Ë∫≤‰∏çÈÅé is a Mandarin cover song of Only Human, the theme song for Japanese true story- television drama 1 Litre of Tears Ôºë„É™„ÉÉ„Éà„É´„ÅÆÊ∂ô sung by Korean artist, K. 1 Litre of Tears started screening on Malaysian private channel 8TV on 4 August 2007 from 6 pm to 7 pm every Saturday. Everytime is an existing English song sung by British boy band, a1, in 1999. Angin Malam is an existing Malay song sung by Indonesian singer, Broery Marantika. It is also one of the three songs sung by Daniel during the Grand Finale of Malaysian Idol 2 in 2005. Other two songs are Heaven Knows (by Rick Price and Mimpi, both recorded in his first album. Music videos Daniel produced MVs for the first two songs in this album, i.e. Because of Love Âõ†Áà≤ÊúâÊÑõ and Love is Under The Sky. However, the MVs do not exactly come together with purchase of the album. Early grabbers are given a free VCD containing the MV for the song Because of Love Âõ†Áà≤ÊúâÊÑõ only. The MV for Love is Under The Sky, on the other hand, is found in the celebration edition of this album.

History In 1314, the village was officially mentioned for the first time as \\"Curtsheit\\". During the time of the Protestant reformation, Kurtscheid was situated on the border of the County of Wied and the Archbishopric of Cologne. In 1546, the Count of Wied decided to select Lutheranism as the general religion within his county. Thus, following the agreement of the Peace Treaty of Augsburg, all inhabitants of his county had to convert their religion accordingly. However, the citizens of Kurtscheid did not want to convert. Therefore, they demolished 11 houses which were situated on the duke's territory and rebuilt them on the archbishop's catholic part of the village. Kurtscheid stayed catholic and for the following centuries, a confessional border divided it from its Protestant neighbours. Politics The parish council consists of 12 members and the honorary mayor.

References Category:Neuwied (district) ","title":"Linkenbach"},{"id":"11819143","text":"Mecistotrachelos is an extinct genus of gliding reptile believed to be an archosauromorph, distantly related to crocodylians and dinosaurs. The type and only known species is M. apeoros. This specific name translates to \\"soaring longest neck\\", in reference to its gliding habits and long neck. This superficially lizard-like animal was able to spread its lengthened ribs and glide on wing-like membranes. Mecistotrachelos had a much longer neck than other gliding reptiles of the Triassic such as Icarosaurus and Kuehneosaurus. It was probably an arboreal insectivore.  Discovery  Mecistotrachelos is known from several fossil specimens excavated from the Solite quarry from the Cow Branch Formation on the Virginia-North Carolina border. However, only two of these have been formally described in a scientific journal. The first fossil was found in 1994 and the second fossil eight years later by Nick Fraser, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Virginia Museum of Natural History. The first fossil, VMNH 3649, is the holotype of the genus and is preserved completely articulated, although missing the tail, hindlimbs, and most of the pelvic girdle. The second fossil, VMNH 3650, is sometimes considered a paratype and is more complete, only missing part of the tail as well as the left hindlimb. The Solite quarry was once a large lake and surrounding wetland which formed in a rift when Pangaea started to break up during the Late Carnian stage of the Triassic, about 230 million years ago. It held abundant populations of insects and the tanystropheid reptile Tanytrachelos. The fossils of the Solite quarry are often preserved as dark grey bones embedded in dark grey mudstone, and are thus usually very difficult to observe and prepare. As a result, the Mecistotrachelos specimens had to be CT scanned to be properly described. This makes Mecistotrachelos one of the first extinct animals to be described based almost entirely on CT scan data.  Description  VMNH 3649, the holotype of Mecistotrachelos apeoros The skull is lightly built and pointed, and there is some evidence for holes in the back of the head, indicating that the animal was a diapsid reptile. The neck is long, consisting of 8 or 9 cervical vertebrae. These vertebrae are elongated but seemingly lack visible cervical ribs, although it is possible that they were too thin or close to the vertebrae to be preserved as separate structures. 13 or 14 dorsal (back) vertebrae were present, a condition similar to most diapsids. The first few dorsals were short and almost all of the dorsals had bony prongs (transverse processes) sticking out of their sides. The tail is missing or incomplete in the described specimens. Specific details of the pectoral and pelvic girdles cannot be identified in the CT scans. The limbs are long and slender, with the hind limbs slightly longer than the front limbs. The manus (hand) had five fingers while the pes (foot) had short metatarsals and an indeterminate number of toes which seemed to have hooked inwards, at least in VMNH 3650. The most unusual and characteristic feature of this genus relates to its ribs. While the first dorsal rib was quite short, at least the next 8 (termed 'thoracolumbar ribs') were very long. They had robust attachment points (particularly the first few) and curved backwards slightly before straightening and tapering. This contrasts with the gliding ribs of kuehneosaurids, which were straight before curving backwards and downwards. The longest ribs were attached to the third and fourth vertebrae, after which they started to decrease in size. At their longest point (~70 centimeters or 28 inches in VMNH 3650) they were a bit less than half the total estimated length of the animal.  Paleobiology  The long ribs of Mecistotrachelos almost certainly were covered with some form of skin which facilitated gliding habits. In addition, the flexible hind limbs with \\"hooked\\" toes preserved in VMNH 3650 indicate that it was well-adapted for an arboreal habitat. However, the long and rigid neck would have hampered gliding abilities. The small teeth of Mecistotrachelos would have been suitable for an insectivorous diet. Unlike in kuehneosaurids, which had downward-curving \\"wings\\", the ribs of Mecistotrachelos were mostly straight, and were not naturally cambered to create an airfoil. However, if the front ribs could be flexed independently of the others, it is possible that a Mecistotrachelos would have been able to create a variable airfoil. The front ribs would function as a pteroid bone in pterosaurs or an alula in birds, increasing or decreasing drag depending on their position. The robust rib heads of these front ribs also support this hypothesis. The skull of VMNH 3649 is comparatively larger than that of VMNH 3650, but the forelimbs are shorter. This may be an example of sexual dimorphism.  Classification  Mecistotrachelos can be characterized by its long ribs which would have supported a gliding membrane in life. However, it was far from the only rib-gliding reptile in prehistory. In the Permian lived the weigeltisaurids, primitive reptiles with small spiked crests. There are also various different gliding lizards, such as Draco (the flying dragon) of the modern day as well as Xianglong from the early Cretaceous. The only other Triassic rib-gliding reptiles were the kuehneosaurids, distant relatives of rhynchocephalians (such as the tuatara) and squamates (such as lizards and snakes). Oddly enough, Mecistotrachelos shares few features with any of these groups, apart from its gliding adaptations and general body shape. Instead, the pointed skull and long neck of this genus is more reminiscent of early archosauromorphs, also known as \\"protorosaurs\\". Archosauromorpha is the lineage which would eventually lead to crocodilians and dinosaurs (including birds), but early representatives superficially resembled long-necked lizards (despite true lizards being on a different reptilian lineage). However, few skull details can be observed in the CT scans to clarify this classification. Mecistotrachelos is not the only putative \\"protorosaur\\" with gliding adaptations. Sharovipteryx, a genus from Kazakhstan, preserved skin impressions stretching between its long legs and its tail. However, this form of gliding contrasts with the rib gliding of Mecistotrachelos, and they are probably not particularly closely related even if they are both archosauromorphs.

It is surrounded by the well-known air-spa of Rengsdorf.  Description  Melsbach is in the midst of thick, lush forests. It is located at the southern border of the Westerwald region and thus often described as a \\"border village\\". Nearby municipalities include: Rengsdorf, Niederbieber, Oberbieber and Altwied. The current mayor of Melsbach is Holger Klein.  History and special events  The first reference to the village's name occurs in 1267 as \\"Melszbach\\" as part of a county that the earl Gottfried von Eppstein, the Younger, had to sell away. In 1396, the \\"Kreuzkirche\\" (church-of-the-cross) chapel was built and first mentioned in 1399 in curatorial documents. The chapel belonged to the St. Thomas monastery (a woman's diocese) of Andernach and it was a famous pilgrimage destination from the beginning.Wilhelm Fabricius: Erl√§uterungen zum geschichtlichen Atlas der Rheinprovinz: F√ºnfter Band: Die beiden Karten der kirchlichen Organisation, 1450 und 1610; zweite H√§lfte: die Trierer und Mainzer Kirchenprovinz; die Entwicklung der kirchlichen Verb√§nde seit der Reformationszeit. BoD, Trier 2015 (reprint of 1913), pp. 231 & 232. Today, the ruins of the Kreuzkirche reside at the southern entrance to the village and have become a tourist attraction and popular panorama motif.Thorsten Lensing: Limesweg: Von Eining an der Donau nach Rheinbrohl am Rhein. 30 Etappen. Mit GPS-Daten: Bergverlag Rother GmbH, Munich 2013, , p. 191 & 192. In 1789, vast clay fields were found, containing both white and colored clay rich in siderite. It was also discovered that the clay contained high amounts of precious alum. The alum mining lasted until 1880; clay mining lasted until the late 1960s. Today's \\"soccer hill\\" at the south entrance of Melsbach, opposite to the Kreuzkirche, is the result of a huge scree slope. Only a winding tower marks the place where the mines¬¥ entrance once was. The tower has become a local emblem and can still be visited, though not climbed.Ralf Schaumann: Technik und technischer Fortschritt im Industrialisierungsprozess: dargest. am Beispiel d.

The clay of Melsbach is described as \\"highly fireproof\\" and \\"of remarkable quality, often preferred for ceramic\\".R. Herrmann: Wo wird Ton abgebaut? In: Keramische Zeitschrift, 41. Ausgabe, 2. Jahresh√§lfte 1989. Verlag Schmid, 1989, p. 85. Despite its rich mineral resources, Melsbach was described as being \\"poor\\" in curatorial documents. In contrast to the neighbourhood municipality Altwied, Melsbach had to pay taxes. And even with the mines, Melsbach grew surprisingly slowly. Between 1753 and 1807, for example, only six new houses were built, and from 1840 and 1895, 22. In 1840, Melsbach counted 399 inhabitants; by 1895 it had 559 citizens. The increase of houses may have been the result of the mining, but oddly enough, the increase of inhabitants in neighbourhood towns, such as Niederbieber, Oberbieber and Rengsdorf was disproportionately higher. It is possible that most of the mine workers came from the surrounding towns.Barbara Closhen: Die Entwicklung der mittelrheinischen Markgenossenschaft am Beispiel des Kreises Neuwied: ein Beitrag zum Gesamtproblem der deutschen Markgenossenschaft.

The surroundings of Melsbach are of geological and archaeological interest: local investigations have led to discoveries of ammonites and plant fossils, as well as a bronze bucket from the late bronze era, dated to 500 BC. The area has also had some seismic activity.Klaus Steing√∂tter: Geologie von Rheinland-Pfalz. Schweizerbart, 2005, , pp. 317.

These forests were crowded with wild animals in such amounts, that wealthy knights and earls greatly enjoyed hunting in these woods. One of these knights, who originated from the valley of the Wied, was known for hunting often in the high forests. One day, he became so eagerly involved hunting a deer, that he completely lost his orientation and any feeling for time and space. Not only did he lose sight of his comrades, when he blew the horn, he received no audible response. Unfortunately, the sun was soon setting and night approached. The knight decided to set up a camp for night under an extraordinarily thick and lush oak tree. Suddenly he saw an ominous bright, white light between the far trees and the figure of a white, shimmering lady appeared. The white lady was holding a shining cross in her hands and told the knight, \\"Follow me!\\" The man did so and the lady guided him home safely. Right after this event the knight became a pious believer and he ordered his servants to erect a large, beautiful cross at the very spot he had encountered the white lady. Later, when he became rich, he gave order to the erection of a chapel at the place where the cross was placed. The chapel was then named \\"Kreuzkirche\\" (church-of-the-cross).Otto Runkel: Aus dem Sagenschatz der Heimat: Westerwaldsagen, gesammelt und erz√§hlt, Volume 1.

He is best known for his feature-length B-movie Acne. Nails has also made several short films, including God is Dad, The Ramones and I, Grethel and Hansel, Animated Corpse, and Santiago vs. Wigface, which won a special recognition award. Biography =Early life and punk rock career= Rusty Nails grew up in a suburb of Boston, Massachusetts and was active in Boston's punk scene. Exposed to B-movie through the local television program Creature Double Feature, Nails became obsessed with old horror films. He made his first foray into the genre in the 1980s with his punk rock band, The Creeps, for whom he sang and about such subjects as teenage violence (\\"On TV\\") and being turned into a zombie by a virulent strain of pimples (\\"Acne\\"). Nails released music by The Creeps on his own label, Wasted Effort Records, along with other local bands like fellow punkers The Angry Kids, the busker street- pop duo Egg (whose members left to join Caroliner Rainbow and found The Presidents of the United States of America), and post-hardbore band Cabal for whom Nails also played bass. Nails also worked as an amateur photographer and publisher, writing and contributing to numerous fanzines, and supported political causes, especially anti-racism and animal rights. Many of his lyrics he wrote for both The Creeps and Cabal reflected these values, and Wasted Effort's releases often contained information and literature from groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. =Film career= In 1991 Nails moved to Chicago to study film at Columbia College and produce several short films. He extended his stay at Colombia by several years in order to complete his first feature-length work, Acne (whose title song is performed by Nails' old punk band), a black-and-white horror film about a pair of teenagers who wake up to find themselves mutated into horribly strange creatures. Nails spent five years and $12,000 on the film, raising funds through yard sales and paying no one but the film's make-up artist $225 to create the giant volcanic pustules for which the film was named. Nails has made various cameo appearances in print, television and film, often under a pseudonym. His likeness has been published in the Weekly World News and he was a guest on both Ricki Lake and The Morton Downey Jr. Show. In later years, Nails focused his attention toward documentary filmmaking, focusing on acts of teen violence and cult filmmakers, including George Romero. Nails supports his work through his film company, New Eye Films, and runs the Movieside Film Festival in Chicago. Filmography =Director= *Dead On: The Life and Cinema of George A.

White. The O'Neill is the recipient of two Tony Awards, the 1979 Special Award and the 2010 Regional Theatre Award, and the 2015 National Medal of Arts presented on September 22, 2016 by President Obama. The O'Neill is a multi-disciplinary institution that has had a transformative effect on American theater. The O'Neill pioneered play development and stage readings as a tool for new plays and musicals, and is also home to the National Theater Institute (est. 1970), an intensive study-away semester for undergraduates. Its major theater conferences include the National Playwrights Conference (est. 1965); the National Critics Conference (est. 1968), the National Musical Theater Conference (est. 1978), the National Puppetry Conference (est. 1990), and the Cabaret & Performance Conference (est. 2005). The Monte Cristo Cottage, Eugene O'Neill's childhood home in New London, Connecticut, was purchased and restored by the O'Neill in the 1970s and is maintained as a museum. The theater's campus, overlooking Long Island Sound in Waterford Beach Park, has four major performance spaces: two indoor and two outdoor. The O'Neill is led by Executive Director Preston Whiteway. Also known as Walnut Grove and Hammond Estate, the estate was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 21, 2005, for its architectural significance, and its associations with Revolutionary War Colonel William North and Edward Crowninshield Hammond, a wealthy industrialist. National Playwrights Conference The National Playwrights Conference (NPC) is one of the premiere play developmental programs in America. Since its founding in 1965, NPC has developed over 600 new plays for the stage, launching the careers of many notable writers, including August Wilson, Wendy Wasserstein, Adam Rapp, John Patrick Shanley, Lee Blessing, John Guare, Gina Gionfriddo, and hundreds more. Each year, the Conference accepts over 1000 scripts under an open-submissions policy. A team of over 125 readers made up of theater professionals, dramaturgs, college department chairs, and past participants help to read the scripts and select the most promising. Of the 8 plays developed in each of the past 5 years, at least 7 are from the open-submissions process, with one writer typically being invited to participate. NPC offers writers a four-week residency at the O'Neill's campus, with strong dramaturgical and professional support. Professional actors, directors, designers, and technicians assist the writer in creating and shaping the play, culminating in two, script-in-hand readings for an audience. Sets, costumes, lights, sounds, and other design elements are only suggested with simple props and cues, to allow the writer the time and space necessary, should they wish to adapt or rewrite the script. First and foremost, NPC is focused on the writer and adapts to serve his or her needs in the development of the play. The National Playwrights Conference has served as a model for several other developmental programs, including the Sundance Institute, Actors Theater of Louisville's Humana Festival; Ojai Festival; the Shelykova Institute in Russia, and more. Lloyd Richards was the first Artistic Director of the National Playwrights Conference, appointed in 1969 by the O'Neill's founder, George C. White. Richards was one of the first African-Americans to lead a major theater program in the United States and ten years later was named Dean of the Yale School of Drama. He continued to hold both positions before retiring from Yale in 1991 and the O'Neill in 1999. The program was then led by Jim Houghton (2000‚Äì2003) and Richard Kuranda (interim Artistic Director, 2004). Wendy C. Goldberg is the current Artistic Director. National Theater Institute The National Theater Institute is home to six credit-earning programs: the National Theater Institute (NTI), NTI Advanced Directing, NTI Advanced Playwriting, the Moscow Art Theatre Semester (MATS), Theatermakers, and the National Music Theater Institute (NMTI). NTI offers many theater study abroad training programs for students - both semester and summer terms are available. The National Theater Institute (NTI) is the O'Neill Center's credit-bearing 14-week intensive theater program for college- age students. Accredited by Connecticut College, NTI offers a comprehensive training curriculum, with classes in acting, directing, design, movement, playwriting, voice, singing, mask work, stage combat, yoga, tai chi, etc. Classes are held seven days a week from 9 am to 10 pm, with a 7:30 am warm-up six days a week. International components include two-week seminars at London/Stratford-upon-Avon to train with Complicite or St. Petersburg, Russia to train at the St. Petersburg State Theatre Arts Academy. The NTI Advanced Directing Semester allows emerging and experienced directing students to concentrate solely on sharpening their craft. The main emphasis is on practical training through table-work, in-class exercises, and intensive rehearsals; classes in directing theory and historical foundations; presentations of classical and contemporary scenes; and a final work-in- progress performance. The Advanced Playwriting 14-week study away program is offered only in the spring, at the O'Neill. This program is a unique opportunity to focus for an entire semester on the craft of writing and developing new plays. There is also a focus on professional training and development to learn about the business of the business, producing one's own work, agents, graduate schools, and submitting to new play festivals. Students leave the program with a portfolio of plays they can submit to festivals and a network of professional contacts. The Moscow Art Theatre Semester (MATS) is the only American undergraduate program where students can train for an entire semester at the Moscow Art Theatre School and work with members of one of the most accomplished theaters in the world. The National Theater Institute has been collaborating with the Moscow Art Theatre for more than 20 years. In this highly competitive 13-week study abroad program offered only in the Fall semester, daily acting classes in the Stanislavsky System, the Michael Chekhov Technique, and movement classes (including Biomechanics and Ballet) are complemented with voice, design, Russian language, and Russian theater history. Students study in the vibrant city of Moscow, visit cultural sites, see theater, and train with master teachers of the Moscow Art Theatre School. Classes are held six days a week, from 9:00 am to 5:30 pm. Theatermakers is a six-week summer program designed for students who are self-driven and want to sharpen their theater skills as an actor, director, or playwright. The Theatermakers summer intensive has three core components: an intensive regimen of classes and workshops with professional artists; a public presentation of new plays created each week by the Theatermakers; and integration into the National Playwrights and National Music Theater Conferences through observing the rehearsal process and being mentored by the professional artists. A small ensemble of about 18 students (actors, directors, and writers) is admitted into this highly selective program to ensure an intimate class size, focused attention from instructors, and close-knit mentorships with the professional artists. With its inaugural semester in the fall of 2014, the National Music Theater Institute (NMTI) is an immersion program for students who want to learn about all aspects of creating music theater. Students of NMTI leave both inspired and able to participate in the creation of all aspects of a musical. NMTI is unique; there is no other semester-long, undergraduate training program in America that offers this intensive immersion in all aspects of music theater. All NMTI teachers are professional working artists hired to share that experience with the students. Students come to NMTI to delve deeply into the craft of music theater and experience a conservatory-like schedule (7:30am to 10pm, seven days a week, for 14 weeks). In addition to daily classes and workshops, students stage a variety of performances starting with short scenes each week and culminating with an evening-length, work-in- progress production open to the public. The students also have a two-week residency in New York City to see theater and train with professionals in a singular series of NMTI workshops and master classes. The motto of NTI is \\"RISK, FAIL, RISK AGAIN.\\" National Critics Institute The National Critics Institute (NCI) was designed for theater writers looking to strengthen their skills. This program offers participants objective feedback from professionals, advice on marketing works, and a chance to get to know and appreciate other writers. This program lasts for two weeks, and includes trips to Connecticut theaters, such as the Goodspeed Opera House and the Ivoryton Playhouse. While most classes are on the grounds of the O‚ÄôNeill, some classes are held at the Monte Cristo Cottage, Eugene O‚ÄôNeill's boyhood home, which is located in New London. The cost for the session is $2,500, and includes a private room, meals, tuition, and tickets to both the Playwrights Conference and Music Theater shows. Chris Jones of the Chicago Tribune currently leads as Artistic Director. National Puppetry Conference The National Puppetry Conference (NPC) was established in 1990 by Jane Henson, George Latshaw, Richard Termine, Bobbie Nidzgorski, Bart P. Roccoberton Jr., Jim Rose and Margo Rose. The NPC is sponsored by the Rose Endowment for Puppetry. The conference lasts for eight days, during which time participants work with renowned puppet artists as well as each other. Participants can explore different performance styles and techniques during workshops, rehearsals, and master classes. Newcomers and experienced puppeteers alike attend this conference. Participants attend a three-day course before the conference, which focuses on the main aspects that comprise puppetry: creating a narrative, building the puppet, and training the performer. Young Playwrights Festival The Young Playwrights Festival is an event dedicated especially to middle school and high school aged students. Participants must be between the ages of 12 and 18 in order to submit a play. In order to be considered for the festival, participants must submit an original play that is ten to fifteen pages in length, and they must be available for the entire duration of the Festival. National Music Theater Conference The mission of the National Music Theater Conference (NMTC) is to provide a challenging and supportive environment in which new and established artists alike can take risks to improve their work. This conference takes place every summer, and it includes several playwrights, lyricists and composers trying to create fresh, unique work. Open submission begins in the fall. Several professionals review the submissions before making the final selections. During the conference, the O‚ÄôNeill provides a staff of directors and musicians to assist the artists in refining their work. Alexander Gemignani is the Artistic Director.

Life Swann grew up on a farm in southern Pennsylvania, before attending Phillips Academy and then Columbia College, where she studied Comparative Literature (French and German) and creative writing with Mary Gordon, graduating in 1994. She pursued her graduate studies at the Sorbonne, Universit√© de Paris VII, earning her master's degree in 1997 with a thesis on the style of Marcel Proust. She now lives in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Insights into her 2001 move to Argentina, divorce and life as an ex-pat writer were the subject of a \\"At Home Abroad\\" column of The New York Times on June 19, 2008. Work Swann's work first appeared in Ploughshares, in an issue guest-edited by Mary Gordon, and she won a Cohen Award for that short story, \\"Flower Children\\", in 1997. The same story won her an O. Henry Award, the Pushcart Prize and selection by The Best American Short Stories. At the time, Ploughshares quoted her: \\"All stories, I think, are in the end a very dense mixture of memory and imagination, with the doses varying each time. 'Flower Children,' I see now, was a story I'd been trying to write since I'd begun writing. It is, in a sense, a condensation of nearly all the stories, pages, and even poems that I wrote in grade school, high school, and then college. In her writing class at Columbia, Mary Gordon, taking my efforts seriously, pressed me further towards it, also introducing me to the Austrian writer Ingeborg Bachmann, whose work eventually led me to find the form in which to say what I wanted to say.\\" Her first novel, Serious Girls, was published by Picador in 2003 and focused on the coming of age of two boarding school girls, Maya and Roe. Swann's second novel, Flower Children, appeared in May 2007, published by Riverhead Books and won the Harold D. Vursell Memorial Award from The Academy of Arts and Letters honoring \\"recent writing in book form that merits recognition for the quality of its prose style.\\" Her third book, The Foreigners [August 2011, Riverhead], which traces the lives of four foreigners living in Buenos Aires, was called \\"a fearless novel,\\" by Joseph O'Neill (author of \\"Netherland\\"), \\"beautifully written, sensual, seductive,\\" by Kirkus Review and \\"atmospheric, evocative literary fiction that ruminates on what it means and how it feels to be foreign\\" by Booklist. Swann's journalism has appeared in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Huffington Post and the Buenos Aires Herald. Her March 2013 story for The New York Times Magazine, \\"The Professor, the Bikini Model and the Suitcase Full of Trouble\\" was optioned for a feature film by Fox Searchlight. She is a Founding Editor of the bilingual literary magazine The Buenos Aires Review. Swann has taught creative writing at Barnard College and also works as a private writing coach. =Flower Children= Flower Children is a series of linked short stories written by Swann over the course of a decade, published ten years before in Ploughshares. The stories are written from different points of view; the first chapter follows a collective, fused third person, i.e. the \\"they\\" of the children growing up; others are told in the first person by Maeve, whom, given the parallels between Swann's fiction and her life, the reader may assume to be her proxy. The book was praised by Michiko Kakutani in \\"The New York Times\\" as \\"a gem of a novel, a novel that showcases [Swann's] eye for detail, her psychological acuity, her ability to conjure up a particular place and time,\\" and summarized in the \\"Newly Released\\" column of The New York Times, where Amy Virshup wrote, \\"In this slim volume she returns to the story, about four young children being raised by their hippie parents on a farm in rural Pennsylvania (which tracks closely Ms. Swann's own childhood). The eight chapters take the children from the paradise of their early childhood ... to young adulthood when they return to the farm as visitors.\\" The tone of the short stories varies, interfering, as one reviewer has noted, with the coherence of the work.Book Forum review of Flower Children by Suzan Sherman, April/May 2007 References External links *\\"The Professor, the Bikini Model and the Suitcase Full of Trouble\\" by Maxine Swann, New York Times Magazine, March 2013 *\\"Crisis and Renewal\\" by Maxine Swann, New York Times, June 19, 2008 *NYT review by Michiko Kakutani *\\"Flower Children\\" story on Boldtype *\\"Beauty and Trash\\" a photo tour of Buenos Aires by Maxine Swann *\\"The Coast of Utopia\\" on Cabo Polonio, Uruguay by Maxine Swann *\\"On Befriending a Fellow Expat in BA\\" by Maxine Swann Category:1969 births Category:American expatriates in Argentina Category:American women writers Category:Columbia College (New York) alumni Category:Living people Category:Writers from Pennsylvania Category:University of Paris alumni Category:American emigrants to Argentina ","title":"Maxine Swann"},{"id":"11819352","text":"Rheinbreitbach is a municipality in the district of Neuwied, in north of Rhineland-Palatinate, bordering North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. Administratively it belongs to the municipality (Verbandsgemeinde) of Unkel. The town is an officially recognized Fremdenverkehrsort (touristic locality). Geography Rheinbreitbach is located at the north end of the Middle Rhine and at the southern edge of the Siebengebirge. As a whole it is part of the Rhine Westerwald Volcanic Ridge (Rheinwesterw√§lder Vulkanr√ºcken). The dimensions of its territory are approximately 7 (east‚Äìwest) by 2 kilometres, its highest point is 375 m, near the summit of the Asberg. Most of the 6,58 km2 area is forested (56.6%) and only a small portion is used agriculturally (8.5%). History The town, presumably founded in Frankish times is first mentioned in official documents in 966 under the name Breitenbach, but finds of coins dated from 150 to 350 AD near the mining operation Virneberg (or Firneberg) shows Roman presence in the region, presumably mining copper. In the Middle Ages the town was surrounded by a wall and moat and sported four fortified gates. The town is first called \\"Rheinbreitbach\\" in 1604. = Mining = The mining of copper-ore and subsequent extraction of the copper is attested by various finds since mediaeval times in near the Virneberg, in Breite Heide. In 1604, one Bartholom√§us Br√ºck reopens the royal copper mines. In 1720 the complex had nearly a kilometer of shafts, and in 1744 eighty employees are registered. In this time the mine is renamed St. Jozefsstollen. In 1756 a document mentions the use of 8000 pounds of Breitbacher kupfer to cast the bells of the Bonn Minster. The mines are visited by a young Alexander von Humboldt during a study trip in 1789. In 1794 production was temporarily halted, but a new shaft, started in 1800 to a depth of 85 meters rendered the mine productive again. In 1840 the 51 miners produced 8500 tons of ore. In 1867 production came to a standstill once again at a depth of 138 meters. Another new shaft was drilled in 1870 reaching a depth of 255 meters, 117 meters below the Rhine, in 1880 but the operation was abandoned in 1886. = Viticulture = Apart from mining, viticulture was a large part of the local economy. The first vineyard to be mentioned is that of Kloster Rolandswerth, the current Nonnenwerth in 1143. The monasteries of Marienstatt and Schwarz- Rheindorf also grew wine here, as did the churches of St. Aposteln, St. Severin, St. Maria ad Gradus, St. Gereon and St. Martin. Also the local gentry, the, Freiherrn von Breidbach and even the Counts of Berg owned vineyards here. The populace was employed on these estates as tenants, the so- called halfen, who owed half or a third of the produce to their landlords, the clergy and the nobility. To prevent the stealing of grapes, special Traubenh√ºter (grape guards) were employed by the community. In 1661 110 vineyards are registered. The year 1889 is still remembered as a top year, grossing an estimated 100,000 Marks. In the 20th century, however, viticulture in the community went into decline due to infestations of Reblaus. Currently there are no vineyards in Rheinbreitbach.

As Watertown Yard, the site also serves as a bus depot serving local and express routes, with additional connections available at Watertown Square on the opposite end of the Watertown Bridge. History A PCC streetcar (left) and a work car in Watertown Yard in 1967 Watertown Carhouse in 2013 In 1900, streetcar service was extended south from Watertown Square to Newton Corner, which served as a transfer point between the Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) and suburban operators. In 1912, the Watertown Line was created by extending the Newton Corner line along these tracks to a new transfer facility, yard, and maintenance facility, Watertown Yard. Watertown Yard formerly served as the terminus of the Green Line A branch, with its heavy maintenance shops eventually handling most work for the remaining trolley routes by the 1950s. When the D branch opened in 1959, the Riverside shops were opened to supplement the Watertown and Reservoir carhouses. Due to a rolling stock shortage created largely by the opening of the D branch, as well as traffic problems at the poorly designed Newton Corner rotary, the A branch was closed in 1969 and replaced by the #57 bus. However, Watertown Carhouse continued to see frequent use. The Bennett Street Carhouse near Harvard Square was closed in the 1970s for construction of the Harvard Kennedy School. On February 22, 1974, the MBTA began conversion of Watertown Carhouse to a trolleybus and streetcar maintenance facility to replace Bennett. During the 1970s and 1980s, the line was kept open for maintenance moves to the carhouse at night. After the newly arrived Boeing LRVs began failing in the late 1970s, the MBTA was desperate for functional rolling stock. At Watertown, 15 out-of-service and wrecked PCC streetcars were rebuilt to as-new condition. (Ten of these cars still run on the Ashmont‚ÄìMattapan High Speed Line). Crews at the carhouse rebuilt trolleybuses serving the Harvard lines, converted other PCC cars into work cars, and salvaged trucks from pre-1924 Blue Line stock to build new work cars. LRVs and even the still-in- use Type 7 cars were brought in for maintenance work, using LRVs equipped with trolley poles to tow the modern pantograph-equipped cars under the older trolley wire. By the time the tracks to Watertown were removed in 1994, Watertown served primarily as the Green Line's scrapyard. Several wrecked cars, including sections of cars 3648 and 3639 wrecked at Copley in 1989, remained in the carhouse until they were scrapped in 2012. Tracks remain in the yard and in the carhouse itself. Watertown Carhouse is now primarily used as a midday layover for buses, as a crew base, and for light maintenance work. Until January 2006, it was used for servicing, storage, and testing of new dual-mode buses and trolleybuses for the Silver Line Phase 2 BRT sets, which were tested under the wires used by the #71. Bus routes A widened sidewalk with two bus shelters on the north side of the site serves as the boarding area at Watertown Yard. Buses entering the yard, especially those going out of service, may drop off passengers at the entrance to the yard. Three local MBTA bus routes, two express routes, and a limited-service route stop at Watertown Yard; all terminate there except for the #59. As a rapid transit replacement service, the #57 is the most frequent and most heavily ridden of the routes. *: Dedham Mall‚ÄìWatertown Yard *: Watertown Yard‚Äì *: ‚ÄìWatertown Square *: Watertown Yard‚ÄìCopley station *: Watertown Yard‚ÄìFederal Street & Franklin Street The Watertown Yard‚Äì route is a single early-morning trip.

Grimm was originally thought to resemble the warped fairy tale style of American McGee's Alice, but the art style appears to be much more child-friendly and simplistic. Grimm is written and executive-produced by the same person as American McGee's Alice, R. J. Berg. The original announcement was made in the June 2007 issue of PC Gamer. Spicy Horse Games is using Unreal Engine 3 technology for American McGee's Grimm. There are 23 weekly episodes, divided into three seasons of eight or seven episodes each. Each episode offers approximately a half an hour of gameplay, although different playing styles (either for \\"complete conversion\\" or \\"speed-runs\\") make for different times. The game has been referred to as \\"highly accessible\\" and American McGee has commented that the game experience shares a similarity with Katamari Damacy. A five-issue comic book mini-series based on the game began in April 2009. Published by IDW Publishing, the book was written by Dwight L. MacPherson with art by Grant Bond.  Gameplay  In American McGee's Grimm, the player controls Grimm, a dwarf who creates a trail of darkness wherever he goes. The premise is that Grimm has become sick of how \\"saccharine sweet\\" fairy tales have become, and has made it his goal to revert lighthearted fairy tales to their darker, original versions by running and jumping through fantasy worlds, making things darker as he passes by them, using a downward move (called a \\"butt-stomp\\") to increase the distance his dark powers reach. By converting enough objects, Grimm can increase the level of his Dark-O-Meter (a bar that shows the effect of Grimm's powers), increasing the power and radius of his dark aura, as well as his running and jumping abilities. Certain characters complicate this process by attempting to clean the areas Grimm has converted, but these enemies can be stopped once Grimm's Dark-O-Meter reaches a high enough level. Of course, Grimm does more than simply \\"restore\\" classic tales to their original unedited versions: he practically reduces many to dark parodies, the original message of the story obliterated, ironically making Grimm little different from those who \\"gutted\\" the stories of their darker tones to begin with.  Distribution  Following the traditional television distribution model, every episode of Grimm is available free for 24 hours on the day of release. After that, episodes are available for purchase on multiple distribution channels and also to GameTap Gold (paid) subscribers. There are currently three volumes of Grimm slated for release with Volume 1 launched on July 31, Volume 2 fall 2008, and Volume 3 early 2009. In a recent interview with GameSpot, McGee said that he would like to put this game on Xbox Live and may release it in retail form. = Episodes =  Season 1  Episode 1. \\"A Boy Learns What Fear Is\\" (Released July 31) When a young boy goes on a quest to find the true meaning of fear, his trek takes a turn for the darker when Grimm appears to muck things up!

The disturbance is said to have taken place on 4 February 1597 at the Logie Candlemas market near Conan House (a mile south-west of Conon Bridge) between men of the Clan Mackenzie against men of the Clan Munro and the Bain family of Tulloch Castle. Background John MacLeod, brother, of the chief of the Clan MacLeod of Raasay was in dispute with the Bains of Tulloch Castle. In the ensuing battle men from the Clan Munro sided with the Bains while men from the Clan Mackenzie sided with MacLeod. Accounts of the battle =17th and 18th century manuscripts= Sir Robert Gordon (1630) The earliest account of the Battle of Logiebride was that by Sir Robert Gordon (1580‚Äì1656) who was living at the time of the battle, in his book the History of the Earldom of Sutherland written in the early 17th century. Gordon states that in 1597 a \\"tumult\\" happened in Ross at a fair in Laggiewreid which almost put all the neighboring counties of Ross into combustion. He states that the quarrel was between John Macgillichallum (brother to the Laird of Raasay) and Alexander Bain (brother of Duncan Bain of Tulloch). Gordon goes on to state that the Munros assisted Bain and the Mackenzies assisted John Macgillichallum, who was killed along with John Mac-Murdo Mac-William, and three others of the Clan Mackenzie. Alexander Bain escaped but on his side John Munro of Culcraggie, with his brother, Hutcheon Munro, and John Munro Robertson were killed. The Munros and Mackenzies then prepared to invade each other but were reconciled by friends and neighbors. John Mackenzie of Applecross (1669) John Mackenzie of Applecross wrote an account of the battle in his manuscript history of the Mackenzies in 1669. Mackenzie of Applecross stated that the year 1597 there fell out again an accident between the Mackenzies and Munros. John M'Gillichallum who was the brother of the Laird of Raasay claimed the lands of Torridon that belonged to the Bains of Tulloch. He alleged that Bain of Tulloch had promised him the land as he had been fostered by him as a child. Bain of Tulloch having died the lands went to his son Alister. Alister having got laws against John came prepared with men in arms including all of the Bains and part of the Munros to the Candlemas market at Laggievriid. John not knowning that laws were against him was at a merchant's shop buying some commodity when Alister Bain came up and struck him with a two handed sword killing him instantly. A Mackenzie tried to intervene but was struck through the back from behind and killed. The alarm was thrown up and the Bains and Munros fled in confusion with the Bains heading to the hills and the Munros to Foulis ferry. Two Mackenzies coming from the market at Chanonry and having heard what had happened allegedly killed thirteen Munros between Laggie and Mulchaich and Alister Bain's men were killed where ever they were seen. The Mackenzies having gained laws against the Munros for the killing of their kinsman burnt the lands of Lemlair. The Bains eventually submitted themselves to the Mackenzies and the Munros were reconciled by the mediation of friends. Wardlaw Manuscript (1674) The Wardlaw manuscript was written in about 1674 by James Fraser. Fraser states that the battle took place on the 4 February 1597 at the Candlemas fair called Bridfaire (St Bridget's Fair) in a town called Lagy Vrud (Logy, Conan), in Ross upon the river of Connin. The quarrel began between John Mackillchallim, a Mackleud (MacLeod), brother to the Laird of Rasey and another gentleman, John Bain, brother of Duncan Bain, Baron of Tulloch, near Dingwall. Fraser states that John Mackillchallum was a vile, flgitious, proflagat fellow, and ravaging robber, picking quarrells with all men, he frequented markets for the purpose of taking advantage of poor chapmen and merchants, pillaging and robbing their shops without resistance. He was also a relation of the Mackenzies and was patronized by them. At this fair he had 6 or 7 bold followers with him. John Bain, a gallant courageous gentlemen, saw him abuse a merchants wife and take away his goods by violence. Bain challenged him, commanding him to give it back or he would make him do it. After verba verbera from words to swords, John Bain draws upon him and gave him two or three deadly wounds. Three Mackenzies were also killed. Upon John Bain's side were killed John Monro of Cularge, and Hugh, his brother and John Monro Robertson. The chase run down the firth towards the mill of Arkaig and the wood of Milchaich, where many were wounded and some slain. John Bain with his Fraser amour bearer withdrew and deliberately escaped to Lovat. The next morning Fraser, Lord Lovat dispatched James Fraser of Phopachy to King James, being then at Falkland, with an account of what had happened. The King sent John Bain full remission and personal protection and a warrand and power to charge the Laird Mackenzie of Kintail with intercommoning, and all the accomplices of John Mackilchallim. Munro family tree (1734) A Munro family tree dating from 1734 only mentions two casualties and agrees with the original account written by Sir Robert Gordon that John Munro of Culcraggie and Hutcheon Munro were killed in the battle. The Munro tree of 1734 does not mention the thirteen Munro casualties mentioned by historian Alexander Mackenzie in his books the History of the Mackenzies (1894) and the History of the Munros of Foulis (1898). =19th - 21st century publications= John Anderson (1825) Historian John Anderson published an account of the battle in his book Historical Account of the Family of Fraser in 1825. Anderson quotes from the MSS History of the Frasers (Wardlaw Manuscript written c.1674 by James Fraser of Wardlaw) and the MSS of Mackenzies (Applecross MS History of the Mackenzies written c.1669 by John Mackenzie of Applecross). Anderson's account is very similar to that given in James Fraser's Wardlaw MS. Anderson also states that a different colour is given in the account by the Mackenzies, but they agree on the main points. Alexander Mackenzie (1894/1898) Alexander Mackenzie later published an account of the battle in his book The History of the Mackenzies (1894) and a similar account in his book The History of the Munros of Fowlis (1898). In The History of Mackenzies, historian Alexander Mackenzie quotes his account of the battle \\"from family MSS\\" and Sir Robert Gordon's \\"Earldom of Sutherland\\". The \\"family MSS\\" is the Applecross MS History of the Mackenzies written by John Mackenzie of Applecross in 1669. Alexander Mackenzie says that a \\"disturbance\\" took place at Logie-Riach, on the banks of the river Conon on 4 February 1597. It was fought between the Mackenzies against the Bains and Munros, in which several of the latter were slain. Mackenzie states that a difference arose between John MacGilliechallum brother of MacLeod, Laird of Raasay and the Bains about the lands of Torridon. Bain attended the Candlemas market at Logie with a large following of armed men which included Bains and a considerable number of Munros. Mackenzie states that John MacGilliechallum came to the fair too and while he was buying something Bain came up behind him and without warning struck him on the head with a sword killing him instantly. Mackenzie goes on to say that one of the Mackenzies tried to interfere but no sooner had he opened his mouth that he was run through the body by one of the Bains. Mackenzie states that the war cry of the Clan Mackenzie was raised and the Bains and Munros then fled followed by a band of Mackenzies, who slaughtered everyone they overtook. Mackenzie goes on to say that two Mackenzies named Ian Dubh MacCoinnich Mhic Mhurchaidh and Ian Gallda Mac Fhionnla Dhuibh having learned of the cause of the Munro's flight slew no less than thirteen of them between Logie and the wood of Millechaich. Mackenzie concludes that most of the Bains were killed and that the Munros lost no less than fifty men. The latter however is not stated in either Sir Robert Gordon's or John Mackenzie of Applecross's 17th century manuscripts. Alan Mackenzie (2006) A recent published account of the battle was written by Alan Mackenzie of the Clan Mackenzie Society USA and Canada, in his book, A History of the Mackenzies, and is almost identical to the earliest account written by Sir Robert Gordon, a contemporary in his book the History of the Earldom of Sutherland written the early 17th century.

It is a foundation focused on human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. Name origin The Foundation's name remembers two personalities who are important for the worldwide struggle for the Human Rights of gay people: Dr Magnus Hirschfeld (1868-1935), after the German physician, sexologist, sexual reformer and civil rights activist and FannyAnn Eddy (1974-2004), the prominent lesbian human rights activist from Sierra Leone, who was murdered in 2004. Background The initiative came from the Lesbian and Gay Federation in Germany (LSVD). LSVD is one of three gay and lesbians organisation which was formally granted consultative status at the United Nations in 2006 and is giving organizational support for the Foundation. Aims, idea and concept The purpose of the foundation is \\"to foster respect for the human rights of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people, contribute to international human rights advocacy, provide active support to human rights defenders, promote awareness-raising and dismantle prejudices.\\" The combination of the names of the \\"founding father of the gay rights movement in Germany\\" and the modern-day \\"human rights activist\\" and Martyr from Africa reflects that the struggle for the human rights of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people began in Europe but is now being waged in every continent of the world. Human rights for LGBT people is a global issue which concerns universal principles. \\"The work which began in 1897 with Magnus Hirschfeld, who established the world's first homosexual rights organization, is now being carried forward by countless people on every continent ‚Äì often at great personal risk. The Hirschfeld-Eddy Foundation also aims to raise awareness of, and counteract, this threat to human rights advocates through international publicity campaigns.

After the war between Americans and Filipinos broke out, the Igorot - mountain inhabitants from the Cordilleras of northern Luzon - sent a contingent of their men to fight the Americans at Caloocan. Armed only with spears, axes, and shields, they decided not to fight against Americans with rifles and artillery.

Khunu Rinpoche was neither a tulku nor a Buddhist monk but a layman (, Skt. upƒÅsaka) who took the lay practitioner's vows . He is renowned as one of the influential teachers in the Rim√© (non-sectarian) movement within Tibetan Buddhism. A foremost scholar of Sanskrit and Classical Tibetan, Khunu Rinpoche traveled widely in Tibet and India disseminating essential teachings of Buddhist philosophy. His students include Drikung Khandro, Khenpo Konchok Gyaltsen, Lamkhen Gyalpo Rinpoche and the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet. Although the Dalai Lama had other highly qualified teachers and debate partners for religious matters, he used to clarify philosophical concepts in discussions with Khunu Lama. Among several teachings that the Dalai Lama received from Khunu Rinpoche was the celebrated BodhisattvacaryƒÅvatƒÅra or Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life by Shantideva. The Dalai Lama called him the \\"Shantideva of our time.\\" and often mentions him when teaching. His seminal work on bodhicitta was translated and published under the title of Vast as the Heavens, Deep as the Sea: Verses in Praise of Bodhicitta by Wisdom Publications in 1999. He died at Shashur Monastery in Lahaul and Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh at the age of 82 on February 20, 1977. Two reincarnations of Khunu Lama have been identified, both of whom are teachers in the Buddhist tradition. Jangchhub Nyima was born to a Tibetan father and Danish mother and currently teaches in India and Denmark. Tenzin Priyadarshi was born into a family of Brahmin parents in Bihar, India and is known for his continued interest in Sanskrit Buddhist literature and was the first Buddhist Chaplain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

History London General Greenway in two door Red Arrow layout Panther Travel Greenway at Clacton Bus Rally in 2011 London & Country Greenway rear in Windsor in 1998 The first Greenway appeared in late 1991. It was conceived by London & Country, which at the time was part of the Drawlane Group, which owned East Lancs. L&C; began a co-operative venture with East Lancs. The idea was to give some of the Leyland Nationals, of which London & Country, still had quite a few, a mid-life rebuild. The engineering work was carried out by London & Country at Reigate, then the buses were sent to Blackburn for the replacement bodywork. Soon East Lancs made the project widespread. Many operators were in the same situation as London & Country. Since the Leyland National had an advanced integral structure which generally remained sound, it was decided that rebuilding was a cost-effective option for them. The project lasted about four years, with the last of the 176 Greenways entering service early in 1996. Another major customer was London General, for the Red Arrow network in Central London.Rejuvenation for the Atlanteans Commercial Motor 11 July 1991E Lancs revamps Red Arrow bodies Commercial Motor 15 October 1992The Green Program Greenway 359 Many different types of National were included in the rebuilding programme: *Mk 1 and Mk 2 *10.3m and 11.3m *Original, Series A and Series B *Standard and Suburban Coach variants *Single- and dual- door However, apart from the length, these differences between the incoming vehicles made little or no difference to the finished product, since each vehicle was stripped down to the barest rolling shell, which was repanelled and given new windows, front and rear ends, and a complete new interior. The engine was replaced by a horizontally mounted, reconditioned Gardner 6HLXB engine, which was no longer available in new buses as it was non-compliant with new Euro-regulations. Despite the extensive nature of the rebuilding, vehicles were eligible to retain their original identity, and some did so. However, many operators chose to apply \\"cherished\\" registrations (mostly Northern Irish), being reluctant to make it too obvious that what might appear to be a brand new bus, could in fact be anything from nine to 21 years old. Appearance The Greenway necessarily retained the basic shape of the Leyland National. The new side windows were of distinctive shape, with square top corners and rounded bottom corners. Plainer panelling was used than on the original National. Most examples were fitted with new doors, with two instead of four leaves. On the roof, the National's familiar \\"pod\\", which had housed heating and ventilation equipment, was discarded. Two distinct designs of front end were fitted. The first had two-piece flat windscreens which met at a slight point in the centre, EL2000-style headlights with separate indicators above, and a shallow, plain bumper. The second (and more common) had a two- piece \\"barrel\\" curved windscreen with level top, a slatted grille matching the height of the headlights, indicators in the headlight surrounds, and a noticeably chunkier bumper. Both windscreen styles had quarterlights. Two distinct designs of rear end were also fitted. The more common was like the EL2000 rear end, having a high-set rear window. The alternative style, used on the London vehicles, had a rear window at approximately the same height as the original, and a space in the bumper for registration plates. Some had the rear route number box under the window, some had an internal box inside the window. Naming Although commonly known as just the Greenway, the first example appeared for promotional purposes with National Greenway branding.

Some linens, wools to be woven into tweed, and the uneven filaments of some types of silk are allowed to retain their normal irregularities, producing the characteristic uneven surface of the finished fabric. Man-made fibres, which can be modified during production, are especially adaptable for special effects such as crimping and texturizing. A hat, scarf, and pair of fingerless gloves made from novelty yarn. Complex yarns Novelty yarns are sometimes referred to as complex yarns. A yarn which makes a fabric is not always smooth and uniform. Complex yarns are the uneven yarns which may be thick and thin or have curls, loops, twists and even differently coloured areas along their length. This look of the yarns are used to add interesting effects in fabrics. In complex ply two or more complex yarns are twisted around each other to form loops, curls and knots to create fancy effects. Many knitting yarns are complex ply yarns which give interesting textures in finished products.it consist of three parts coreply yarn,effect ply and binder yarn, Types =Boucl√©= Boucl√©, or looped, yarns are created by loosely looping an effect yarn around a base yarn. They can be made of any type of fiber and are usually composed of three plies, or strands, wrapped around each other. The texture is created by spinning one of the three plies more loosely than the other two. Fiber artists who choose to create projects in boucl√© yarn must use extra care because if not handled carefully, the loose strand may split and snag on the knitting needles or crochet hook. A sweater knit from Plarn (plastic bags) made by the fashion label Eckhaus Latta. =Chenille= The soft, fuzzy surface of chenille yarns, which resemble pipe cleaners in appearance, can be created in several ways. Most commonly, a fabric is first produced and then cut into narrow strips resembling a yarn. Then, when the fabric is cut, the raw edges become very fuzzy and produce the chenille appearance. Other chenilles are created by trimming a loosely attached effect fiber to create the fuzzy appearance. Still other chenilles are created by attaching or gluing fibers to the yarn. =Core= A yarn in which the core has been wrapped by another strand, such as of cotton or nylon around an elastic base as used in commercial socks. =Corkscrew or spiral= The appearance of corkscrew or spiral yarns is achieved by using yarns of two different fibers and often twisting one under a different tension than the other. =Crepe yarns= Crepe yarns may be classified as fancy yarns and are created by tightening the twist given to a yarn, resulting in a kinked or looped strand. =Eisengarn= Eisengarn, meaning \\"iron yarn\\" in English, is a light-reflecting, strong, waxed-cotton thread. It is made by soaking cotton threads in a starch, paraffin wax solution. The threads are then stretched and polished. The end result of the process is a lustrous, tear-resistant yarn which is extremely hardwearing.Industriegeschichte aus dem Bergischen land (in German). (Accessed: 27 November 2016)WDR digit project. Eisengarnfabrikation in Barmen. (Video (16 min) in German). (Accessed: 27 November 2016). Invented in the 19th Century, eisengarn was used as a weaving yarn and for making lace, ribbons and lining materials. The yarn is also known as Glanzgarn ('gloss' or 'glazed' yarn) and can be knitted into woollen clothing and other textiles to add shiny highlights. Zeitlos-berlin.de. Eisengarn ‚Äì Eine Material Geschichte (in German). =Eyelash= Eyelash yarn is made from a polyester fiber with a furry texture resembling eyelashes. These novelty yarns are made of a thin central ply surrounded by short \\"hairs\\". This yarn differs from \\"fur\\" type yarn in that it contains evenly spaced threads at intervals between lengths of bare core thread, whereas fur yarns have an abundance of threads covering the entirety of the core thread. Eyelash yarn comes in a wide range of colors, with the \\"hairs\\" sometimes being made of multicolored or metallic fibers. =Ladder= Ladder yarn resembles a ladder, with two flat threads representing the two sides of the ladder held together by a strip of material at the center that represents the rungs. The material at the center of ladder yarn can be metallic, beaded, or otherwise adorned. This type of yarn is more often used to create trim or embellishments than to knit or crochet entire garments. =Metallic fiber= Metallic fibers are often classified as fancy yarns and are created by adding a metallic fiber or yarn to the blend.Telling a good yarn by Jenny Lunnon, Oxford Times, Thursday 21 September 2006. These are not to be confused with actual wire used in jewellery that is sometimes knit or crocheted. =Nub= A nub or knot is created by tightly twisting an effect fiber around the base fiber. The nub is most easily identified when the effect and base yarns are of different colors. =Plarn= Plastic yarn, or ‚Äúplarn‚Äù, is constructed from plastic bags. Plarn can be used to knit or crochet plastic mats. =Ribbon= Ribbon yarn resembles a ribbon. It can be made from synthetic or natural fibers, such as silk or cotton. Some ribbon yarns are flat, while others are tubular in construction. =Slub= A slub or thick spot in a yarn is created by varying the tightness of the twist of the yarn at various intervals.

It is within the townland of Curryhills, at the junction of the R403 and R408 regional roads, about from Dublin. Its 2016 population was 2,333, making it the 14th largest town in County Kildare. History The English name of Prosperous was given when the village was founded in the late 18th century by Sir Robert Brooke. The village takes its Irish name from the townland lying to the east, Corrchoill or an Chorrchoill (meaning \\"the smooth forest\\"), anglicised variously as Corr[y]hill[s], Curr[i]hill[s] and Curryhills.Placenames Database of Ireland (see archival records) An alternative meaning is \\"The wood of the small round hill\\" 4 and this makes sense topographically as there is a low hill immediately to the east of the village. The village extends into the surrounding townlands of Ballinafagh, Killybegs, Curryhills and Downings (north, south, east and west, respectively). The town of Prosperous owes its origin to the vision and ideals of Sir Robert Brooke (1744-1811) from County Cavan. The late eighteenth century was a time of attempted industrial development in Ireland and the industry upon which Prosperous was founded in 1780 was cotton manufacturing. The name chosen by Brook for his industrial town could only be the product of a confident dream. A close parallel to the development of Prosperous was Stratford-on-Slaney in County Wicklow, founded by Henry Stratford, Earl of Aldeborough in 1785 as a textile centre. Despite huge investment and, in the case of Prosperous, much building and an initial population of 4,000, both industrial ventures were failures. Stratford practically disappeared and Prosperous declined to such an extent as to be described by Lewis in 1837 as ‚Äòlittle more than a pile of ruins' situated 'in a low marshy spot, surrounded by bogs and without water of importance nor reasonable hope of its revival' and more recently as a ‚Äòstraggling village labouring under its resounding name'. A number of r√°ths have survived in the Prosperous area, indicating settlement of the place in early Christian times. Time has not been kind to these ancient fortifications although in the case of one, it has been preserved as the centrepiece of a housing development: Rath View. There is a fort, or rath, just outside Prosperous on the eastern side of The Blackstick (R409 road to Caragh). It is possible that the townland of Downings takes its name from the word \\"D√∫n\\", the Irish for ‚Äòfort', although questionable - given the higher proliferation of raths in many other parts of Ireland. Another explanation is that the local population used to converge at the nearby church on Sunday or in Irish D√© Domhnaigh - a closer phonetic match. Some confusion arises after the late 1990s when a housing development in the village was named The Downings. Downings graveyard and church ruins, in the townland of Downings North - north of the R403 to Allenwood, mark the place of the first Christian church in the area. Tradition states that the church occupies the site of the cell of St Farnan whose feast is celebrated on the 15th of February. Nearby is the well of St Farnan which is said to have been blessed by the saint, giving it the valuable property that those who drink of its water never after have any relish for intoxicating drink. The old parish in this area was known as Downings. It was joined to the parish of Caragh in the eighteenth century. There is another ruined church surrounded by a graveyard at Killybegs. The Knights Hospitaller of St. John of Jerusalem had a Commandery here but very little is known about it. A lease of 1538 refers to the priory and this points to its foundation before that date. The octagonal baptismal font with its carving of an angel, which is now at Prosperous church, came from Killybegs. During penal times there was a Mass-house in the townland of Goatstown which is north of the Grand Canal. When the town of Prosperous was built, a Catholic church was erected near the cross-roads close to the present Drama Hall. This church was replaced by the present limestone church in 1869.The Church Bell Thomas Harris (1895 ‚Äì 18 February 1974) was a prominent Fianna F√°il politician from the town. A native of Cloncurry, near the Meath border, he was raised in Prosperous by his aunt Elizabeth Tierney. As a young man Thomas Harris had joined the Gaelic League while in school in Prosperous and subsequently joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood, County Kildare. Harris fought with the Maynooth contingent in 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin and was imprisoned in Frongoch, Wales until August 1916. Harris was later Captain of the Prosperous Company in 1917 and later Vice-Commandant North Kildare Battalion of the Irish Republican Army in 1921. A farmer, he represented the constituencies of Kildare from 1927 to 1937, Carlow‚ÄìKildare from 1937 to 1948, and Kildare again from 1948 to 1957. He lost his seat at the 1957 general election and retired from politics. The town lent its name to Christy Moore's 1972 album, Prosperous, which was recorded there. =Battle of Prosperous= The ruin of the town was accelerated by the Rising of 1798 . Prosperous was one of the first places where the United Irishmen rose. In the early morning of 24 May 1798, a large group of rebels attacked the crown forces in the town. One of the buildings holding over 50 men, including the leader, Captain Swayne, was burned. Oral tradition relates that the rebels were led by Andrew Farrell and John Esmonde and assisted by Ruth Hackett in the burning of the barracks. She is featured on the 1798 monument in the town square. The rebels held Prosperous until the crown forces recaptured it on the 19th of June. The troops were under the command of Colonel Stewart who boasted of destroying \\"this receptacle of rebellion\\". He said that the soldiers found drums with the inscription \\"Prosperous Strength Exists in Unity and Liberty\\". Modern town R408 through town centre Despite the disappearance of all of the industrial buildings several of the houses of 1780 have survived along the broad Main Street with its two squares. These add great charm to the historic core of the town centre. This, along with development along the main through- road, has effectively created a town in two sections. The main road through Prosperous is the R403 and the town is within of both the M4 (to the north) and M7 (to the south) motorways. Prosperous Main Street, however, runs perpendicular to the R403. The village educational, shopping, social and community facilities serve the people of the surrounding area. It is now developing as a residential centre serving the industrial development of northern Kildare and the growing city of Dublin. In 2011 it had 748 private households and its population was 2,248 consisting of 1,132 women and 1,116 men. At that time 888 people said they spoke Irish and 167 people said they spoke another language other than English or Irish. Leisure Prosperous Dramatic Society Theatrical productions are held in the drama theatre, located in the parish centre. Pitch and Putt A pitch and putt course, and its clubhouse, are situated in the community field beside the church. Street along R408 Tennis Courts Tennis courts are situated beside the church across from the local primary school. Golf Society Christy's Golf Society is based in Christy's public house. It was founded in 1995. Soccer The local soccer club is Prosperous United A.F.C. G.A.A. The local Gaelic football team is Caragh G.F.C. and the local hurling team is √âire √ìg/Chorr Choill. In summer months, a group of students from the Basque area of Spain come to Prosperous and stay at local homes. Prosperous Music Festival Prosperous Music Festival ran from 2012 to 2018. Over 50 bands and acts attended the event over a weekend and it was a free-to-attend event. Different types of music could be heard at the festival, and it attracted an average of 3,000 people annually. Public transport Prosperous is well served by Bus √âireann route 120 Edenderry as well as routes 121 Tullamore and 123 Robertstown. Buses to Dublin depart as frequently as every 15‚Äì30 minutes during peak commuter times. Education Primary education is provided by Prosperous National School/Scoil an Linbh √çosa. It has an enrolment of 500 pupils. Secondary education for Prosperous and surrounding areas is provided by Saint Farnan's Post-Primary School, which opened in 1941.

Its name comes from the ability to assimilate lactose and convert it into lactic acid. Kluyveromyces lactis (formerly Saccharomyces lactis) is a yeast which has the ability to assimilate lactose and convert it into lactic acid. K. lactis and other organisms i.e., Aspergillus niger var awamori and Escherichia coli K-12 are grown in fermenters to produce chymosin (rennet) on a commercial scale; this rennet, which replaces the conventional form obtained from slaughtered animals, is now widely used in cheese production. Yeasts and fungi are ideal organisms for comparative genomic studies in eukaryotes because of their small and compact genomes and because they include a number of species such as Neurospora crassa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, that have been, and continue to be, used extensively in genetic studies. However, the divergence between these three species is ancient (estimated to be at least 300 million years old) and the organization of their genomes is quite different. The diversity of the hemiascomycetes, a group of ascomycetes that contains most of the known yeast species, was first explored in 2000. Complete sequencing and comparison of four hemiascomycetous yeasts has been undertaken for Candida glabrata, Kluyveromyces lactis, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Yarrowia lipolytica. They were selected on the basis of their phylogenetic positions and their specific interest as human pathogens, or as industrially or environmentally important yeasts. This work, which represents the first multispecies exploration of genome evolution across an entire eukaryotic phylum, reveals the variety of events and mechanisms that have taken place, and should allow useful comparisons with other phyla of multicellular organisms when more genome sequences are determined. K. lactis is a heterothallic species with a predominantly haplontic cycle, in contrast to S. cerevisiae in which the predominantly diplobiontic cycle is pseudo- heterothallic due to mating-type switching.http://www.ebi.ac.uk/2can/genomes/eukaryotes/Kluyveromyces_lactis.html  Genomics analysis  In the 1990s, few genes were known and analysed by scientists until the first genomic analysis was performed by a team of the Pasteur Institute of Paris.Nucleic acids research. 1998;26(23):5511-5524 Random exploration of the Kluyveromyces lactis genome and comparison with that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae The genome Kluyveromyces lactis was explored by sequencing 588 short tags from two random genomic libraries (random sequenced tags, or RSTs). By comparison with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, 296 K.lactis genes were identified of which 292 were new. The complete genome of K. lactis was sequenced in 2004.Nature. 2004 Jul 1;430(6995):35-44 Genome evolution in yeasts  References  Category:Saccharomycetaceae Category:Fungi in cultivation ","title":"Kluyveromyces lactis"},{"id":"11819826","text":"Frank Hamilton may refer to: *Frank Hastings Hamilton (1813‚Äì1886), American surgeon *Frank Fletcher Hamilton (1921‚Äì2008), Canadian Progressive Conservative MP *Frank Hamilton (musician) (born 1934), American folk musician and co-founder of Chicago's Old Town School of Folk Music *Frank Hamilton (rugby union) (1863‚Äì1901), South African rugby union player *Frank Hamilton (singer), English singer, songwriter and producer See also *Francis Hamilton (disambiguation) ","title":"Frank Hamilton"},{"id":"11819828","text":"Frank Carpenter may refer to: *Frank G.

The yarn is made from a length of loops of similar size which can range from tiny circlets to large curls.\\"Boucl√©.\\" The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. To make boucl√©, at least two strands are combined, with the tension on one strand being much looser than the other as it is being plied, with the loose strand forming the loops and the other strand as the anchor. Boucl√© is also the name of the fabric made from this type of yarn, especially fabric that maintains the looped appearance. Machine spinning In machine spinning, boucl√© can be created in a single step, using a hollow spindle. It is made by differing the feed rate of the effect yarn with respect to the core yarns. The core yarns are wrapped around the effect yarn either loosely or tightly, depending on the difference in feed rates and amount of twist used. The regularity of the loops is controlled by varying the distance between the point where the core yarns come together and the guide. By increasing the distance, the boucl√© becomes more irregular.Gong, R. H.; Gong, H.; Wright, Rachel M. Fancy Yarns: Their Manufacture and Application. Woodhead Publishing, 2002. .

He played professionally in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins. He played college football at the University of Dayton and the University of Alabama. Early years After attending Stamford High School, he first enrolled at the University of Alabama, but left as a sophomore to manage the family restaurant after his father became ill. In 1954, he was recruited by the University of Dayton where he played running back and safety in his first two years, before switching to a two-way end. As a senior, he led the nation and broke the school's receiving record with 37 receptions for 546 yards in seven games (he also punted 28 times for a 32.2-yard average), earning him All-American honors and an invitation to the East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game. Professional career =San Francisco 49ers= Dugan was selected by the San Francisco 49ers as a junior in the seventh round (80th overall) of the 1957 NFL Draft, but didn't join the league until 1958. Although he saw limited playing time during his first two seasons, he was known for making spectacular catches. =Dallas Cowboys= The Dallas Cowboys selected Dugan in the 1960 NFL Expansion Draft, where along with Billy Howton, became the first wide receivers ever to start for the franchise. That year, he was the second leading receiver on the team (behind Jim Doran), while earning a reputation for spectacular catches and producing 29 receptions for 461 yards and a touchdown. After asking to be traded to be closer to his ailing father, he was sent to the Washington Redskins in a three-team deal on July 5, 1961. The Redskins acquired Dugan, placekicker John Aveni, defensive back Dave Whitsell and offensive end Jerry Daniels. The New York Giants obtained offensive ends Joe Walton and Jim Podoley. The Cowboys received placekicker Allen Green and a sixth round for the 1962 NFL Draft that the team later used to draft George Andrie. =Washington Redskins= Dugan flourished with the Redskins in his first season, breaking the team receiving record and setting career highs with 53 receptions for 817 yards and four touchdowns. In his second season after the Redskins obtained Bobby Mitchell, he had 36 receptions for 466 yards and five touchdowns. He retired following the 1963 season after having 20 receptions for 288 yards. His career totals were 153 receptions for 2,226 yards and 13 touchdowns.

It has a thread base, with several long strands spaced at even intervals that jut out at an angle from the main strand. The long strands, or hair, can be metallic, opalescent, matte, or a combination of types. The hair can be curly or straight and can be two different lengths. Prominent types are composed of 100% polyester with a straight and relatively short hair. Because of its thinness, eyelash is normally carried along with another, plainer yarn to add visual interest to the primary yarn. There are many variations in the texture and composition of eyelash yarns, such as pigtail or ponytail, which have a thicker base and what appear to be flags tied onto the base strand at even intervals, or fur, in which the base has a more frequently occurring or thicker grouping of hairlike strands which, in the finished fabric, will be hairy and have the general aspect of faux fur. Drawbacks of eyelash yarns include poor stitch definition, because the hairs obscure the appearance of the base, and that they add bulk to a garment. Because of this, they are mostly used for accessories, such as scarves, or as garment trim. Some types of eyelash yarn can be used for decorative purposes. These types combine metal-look lurex with a polyester core which mimics a tinsel effect but is more durable than typical tinsel and be reused for annual celebrations.

In the 1820s, he founded Funks Grove, Illinois in McLean County, Illinois with his brother and became a prominent cattle trader. Funk was elected to one term in the Illinois House of Representatives in 1840. Despite several financial setbacks, Funk remained one of the wealthiest settlers in the area. He served in the Illinois Senate in the 1860s and died before his second term was complete. He was the patriarch of the Funk family and co-founded Illinois Wesleyan University. Biography Isaac Funk was born on November 17, 1797 in Clark County, Kentucky to Adam and Sarah (Moore) Funk. He was one of nine children and received little schooling. In 1807, he moved with his family to Fayette County, Ohio. In 1821, Funk left his family to work at the Kanawha Salt Works in Virginia for a year. He then returned to Ohio, working as a laborer on a farm. In April 1824, Funk moved to Sangamon County, Illinois. His stay was brief, and he moved to McLean County, becoming one of the county's first settlers. There, he established Funks Grove, Illinois with his brother Absalom. He and his brother began a successful business raising cattle and farming. By the 1830s, the Funks were among the richest settlers in the area. However, they lost half of their fortune in the Panic of 1837. The brothers dissolved their partnership the next year. Funk continued to rear cattle and slowly rebuilt his fortune. He was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1840, ostensibly as a Whig, serving one two-year term. He again met financial hardship during the Great Flood of 1844, when many of his cattle died. He was named to the Board of Trustees of Illinois Wesleyan University in 1850 as one of its original founders. Funk again rebuilt his wealth and was able to build a large house in the 1860s. In 1862, Funk was appointed to fill the Illinois Senate term of Richard J. Oglesby, who resigned to fight in the Civil War. By this point, Funk was affiliated with the new Republican Party. Funk was elected to a second two-year term in 1864. Funk was a Whig before becoming a Republican. He was friend of Abraham Lincoln and worked in his presidential campaign of 1860. Isaac Funk, along with his attorney and friend, Abraham Lincoln, were responsible for bringing the Chicago & Alton Railroad through the Bloomington area, sidetracking it from its planned route through Peoria.http://www.legendsofamerica.com/il-funksgrove.html Funk married Cassandra Sharp in June 1826. They had ten children. Funk died on January 29, 1865 in Bloomington, Illinois. He fell ill with erysipelas and diphtheria the previous day at his home after returning from a legislative session. His wife died later that day. He was buried in Funks Grove Cemetery (Funks Grove, Illinois). Although he left no formal will and testament, his children donated $10,000 to create the Isaac Funk Professorship of Agriculture at Illinois Wesleyan. Funk was named to the Farmers' Hall of Fame at the University of Illinois and a portrait of him was hung there in 1913. =Funk family= Isaac Funk was the patriarch of the Funk family, a mainstay in Illinois and American politics. His eldest son George Washington assumed most of his business interests and was later elected to the Illinois House. His fourth son, Duncan McArthur, served three terms in the Illinois House.Fifth son Marquis De LaFayette served a term in the state house and then two terms in the state senate. He was the father of Eugene Funk, a prominent businessman and member of the Illinois Board of Agricultural Advisors. Seventh son, Benjamin F. Funk, was elected to the United States House of Representatives. Benjamin's Funk's son Frank H. also served in the U.S. House. Only daughter Sarah married Leonidas H.

It is named after its inventor, Marcellin Berthelot. Ammonia reacts with Berthelot's reagent to form a blue product which is used in a colorimetric method for determining ammonia. The reagent can also be used for determining urea. In this case the enzyme urease is used to catalyze the hydrolysis of urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia. The ammonia is then determined with Berthelot's reagent. Variations Phenol in the Berthelot reagent can be replaced by a variety of phenolic reagents, the most common being sodium salicylate, which is significantly less toxic. This has been used for blood urea nitrogen (BUN) determinations and commonly is used to determine water and soil total and ammonia-N. Replacement of phenol by 2-phenylphenol reduces interferences by a variety of soil and water constituents and improves color stability at slightly lower pH. Uses Berthelot's reagent has been used in a range of situations. It is often used in colorimetric methods, through an AutoAnalyzer, spectrophotometer, or multiwell plate spectrophotometer. The reagent lacks sensitivity in situations where there may be amines as well as ammonia, however this can be overcome in part by the use of 2-phenylphenol to replace phenol. An ion selective electrode, or distillation/titration method can often be used in cases where Berthelot chemistry is ineffective. Berthelot chemistry has also been adapted for the analysis of nitrite and nitrate in soil and water after conversion, typically by reduction with Devarda's alloy, of these species to ammonium.

History  Bedford Road, passing through Bedford Pass, was an important north-south route in the 18th century for traffic between the farming village of Flatbush and the headwaters of Newtown Creek. In the 19th century, it was extended south to the shore, and late in the century, it became one of the earliest paved roads in the rapidly growing eastern suburbs of the City of Brooklyn.  Transportation  Automobile traffic flows in two directions: south of Grant Square, at Dean Street; and one-way northbound north of that location. The northernmost block of Bedford Avenue, between the intersections of Lorimer Street/Nassau Avenue and Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint, was formerly bi-directional. In July 2018, this block was made one-way eastbound, with all traffic on northbound Bedford Avenue being forced to turn onto eastbound Nassau Avenue, at the Lorimer Street intersection. Northbound and southbound bicycle lanes are painted on the avenue south of Grant Square. There are two New York City Subway stations named after the avenue: the Bedford Avenue () station at Bedford Avenue and North 7th Street in Williamsburg; and the Bedford‚ÄìNostrand Avenues () station at Bedford Avenue and Lafayette Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant. The B44 bus runs on a large part of the avenue.  Buildings  The many different building types common in Brooklyn are evident at some point on the avenue, from attached and detached single-family houses in Sheepshead Bay and Midwood, to brownstone rowhouses in Crown Heights and Bedford-Stuyvesant, to medium and large apartment buildings in Williamsburg and Greenpoint. In addition, the avenue passes through neighborhoods representative of Brooklyn's famous cultural and ethnic diversity. African-American, Caribbean, West African, Hasidic, Latin American, Russian, and Polish neighborhoods are all found along the avenue. Designated landmarks include the Studebaker Building and the 23rd Regiment Armory.

It is locally known as tamanqueiro, tapi√° or amor seco. This gnarled tree grows preferentially in riparian forest, where it a common pioneer species growing to a height of 10‚Äì20 m. It is essentially evergreen, though in the hot austral summer months there is a more pronounced changeover of leaves, and branches are denuded to some extent.Conegero et al. (2003), Pascotto et al. (2006) The fruit is about 8.7 mm long by 5.9 mm wide on average, and contains one round seed measuring about 4.45 mm in diameter; very rarely a second seed develops. This sticks out of an aril at the fruit's tip; when ripe, the seedcoat turns bright red and the fruit somewhat resembles that of a yew with a larger and more prominent seed. Fruit ripen in the summer months, roughly between September/October and December/January in S Brazil, and as the trees bear less leaves at that time than otherwise, the bright red fruit are easily spotted.Pascotto et al. (2006) Stigmasterol can be obtained from A. glandulosa This tree is often cut down for timber, but it is also useful as a honey plant. Also, its leaves contain compounds of medical interest. In folk medicine, Alchornea species are used to treat assorted skin diseases, diarrhea, inflammations, leprosy and rheuma. Scientific studies have confirmed most of these effects, and also found extracts of certain species to kill off trypanosoma, some bacteria and fungi, and cancer cells; the latter properties have also been tested in A. glandulosa. Compounds of interest in A. glandulosa include the phytosterols Œ≤-sitosterol and stigmasterol, the terpenoid loliolide, the guanidine alkaloid N-1,N-2,N-3-triisopentenylguanidine, and the phenolic compound corilagin.Conegero et al. (2003) Given the fruit's attractive color and the conspicuous display at the branch-tips, this tree appears to be distributed by birds which eat the fruit and spread the seeds. Perching birds, namely tanagers (Thraupidae), thrushes (Turdidae) and tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae), are most commonly seen to feed on the fruit. Some birds, such as the silver-beaked tanager (Ramphocelus carbo), prune off the seedcoat and eat it, discarding the seed, but most swallow the entire fruit. Species such as the swallow tanager (Tersina viridis) and the pale-breasted thrush (Turdus leucomelas), but perhaps most of all the sayaca tanager (Thraupis sayaca), appear to be particularly fond of them. Indeed, the sayaca tanager will defend richly fruiting A. glandulosa trees against similar-sized birds such as the blue dacnis (Dacnis cayana) or the red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus). It may be that at least locally, T. sayaca is crucial for the tree's reproduction and survival. A. glandulosa fruit are also significant food of certain migrant birds in their winter quarters. In particular the red-eyed vireo and the white-necked thrush (Turdus albicollis) have been noted to be fond of them, and Swainson's flycatchers (Myiarchus swainsoni) visit the trees very often too. But as it does not relish the fruits very much, the latter species is perhaps more attracted to insects living on the tree.

Design and development By 1921, enough experience had been gained with operation of the de Havilland DH.18 to realise that aircraft needed to be more efficient to improve the economics of air travel. de Havilland therefore built the ten-passenger DH.29 monoplane, while starting work on the design of the DH.32, a biplane of similar size and capacity to the eight-passenger DH.18, but with a less powerful but more economical Rolls-Royce Eagle engine. Owing to the urgent need for more capacity, however, work on the DH.29 and DH.32 was stopped and the DH.34 biplane was designed, with a similar fuselage to the DH.29, accommodating ten passengers. The DH.34 had a wooden, plywood- clad fuselage, with the cockpit (for two pilots) being positioned ahead of the wings and the passenger cabin. It had two-bay wooden wings and was powered by a Napier Lion engine, which was fitted for inertia starting, avoiding the necessity for hand swinging of the propellor to start the engine.Jackson, A.J. British Civil Aircraft since 1919 Volume 2. London: Putnam,1973. . Unusually, the design of the aircraft allowed an entire spare engine to be carried on board across the rear of the passenger cabin. The cabin door's unusual shape was to allow the engine to be loaded and unloaded, and a specially-fitted 'porthole' on the other side of the cabin would be removed to allow the propeller boss to protrude out the side of the aircraft. Spare engines were not carried routinely (the DH.34's payload was too low to carry both passengers and a spare engine) but this facility was used by operators to quickly fly spare engines out to aircraft that had suffered breakdown. Two DH.34s were ordered by the Daimler Airway, as part of an initial batch of nine aircraft, with the first prototype (registered G-EBBQ) flying on 26 March 1922. The stalling speed of 63 mph (101 km/h) was considered high and was blamed for a fatal crash in 1923, so extensions were fitted to the upper wings, increasing the wingspan from 51.33 ft (15.65 m) to 54.33 ft (16.56 m). Operational history The DH.34 entered service with Daimler on 2 April 1922 on the Croydon-Paris service.Donald, David, ed. The Encyclopedia of World Aircraft. London: Aerospace Publishing, 1997. . Daimler operated a total of six D.H.34s, four of which were leased from the Air Council, with Instone Air Line operating a further four, all leased. One aircraft was built to the order of the Soviet airline Dobrolyot. When Imperial Airways was formed on 1 April 1924, by the merger of Daimler Airway, Instone Air Line, Handley Page Transport and the British Marine Air Navigation Company, it inherited six D.H.34s, retaining the type in service until March 1926. The DH.34s were used heavily on the cross channel air services, with the fleet flying 8,000 hours in the first nine months of operation, and the second aircraft flying over 100,000 mi (160,000 km) without overhaul.

Hversu Noregr bygg√∞ist in the Flateyjarb√≥k states that the Kvens offered a yearly sacrifice to √ûorri at mid-winter. The modern festival arose in the second half of the 19th century, with the Romantic nationalism of the time, comparable to Burns night in Scotland. The first known celebration was reportedly organised by the association of Icelandic students in Copenhagen in 1873,√ìlafur Dav√≠√∞sson in √çslenskar g√°tur, skemmtanir, v√≠kivakar og √æulur (1887‚Äì1903, Copenhagen: B√≥kmenntaf√©lagi√∞): :\\"√ûorrabl√≥t was begun by Icelandic students in Copenhagen, or at least they did hold a √ûorrabl√≥t in 1873. I've heard it said that Dr. Bjorn Olsen presented the best performance with his poem \\"the cup of Thor\\". In 1880, the Archaeological Society of Reykjavik held a √ûorrabl√≥t. [...] We drank remembrance to the gods, of Odin allfather, of Thor, of Freyr and Njord for the year-blessing\\" :√ûorrabl√≥tin eiga uppt√∂k s√≠n a√∞ rekja til √≠slenskra st√∫denta √≠ Kaupmannah√∂fn, e√∞a a√∞ minnsta kosti h√©ldu √æeir √æorrabl√≥t 1873. √âg hef heyrt sagt, a√∞ doktor Bj√∂rn √ìlsen hafi gengist mest fyrir √æv√≠ og eftir hann er veislukv√¶√∞i√∞, Full √û√≥rs. 1880 mun Fornleifaf√©lagi√∞ √≠ Reykjav√≠k hafa haldi√∞ √æorrabl√≥t [...] Vi√∞ samdrykkjuna √° eftir var gu√∞anna minnst, √ì√∞ins alf√∂√∞ur, √û√≥rs, Freys og Njar√∞ar til √°rs√¶ldar [...] and by other societies active in the Icelandic independence movement of the time (Iceland received a constitution in 1874, and was recognized as a kingdom in personal union with Denmark in 1918). The √ûorrabl√≥t is an evening with dinner where participants hold speeches and recite poems, originally to honour the Norse god Thor (√û√≥rr), whose name is taken to be associated with √ûorri. Calling the feast a bl√≥t (a sacramental feast held in honor of a god in Norse mythology) makes clear the reference to pre-Christian times, which many nationalists of the 19th century considered a golden age of Icelandic history. The festival gained wide publicity in the 1960s. This was due to a Reykjav√≠k restaurant, called Nausti√∞, starting to offer a platter with a selection of foods that had previously been common in the Icelandic countryside, but had become rare by that time, in 1958. The food was arranged in slices on a wood trough made in the likeness of old troughs on display in the National Museum of Iceland. The restaurant advertised this platter as √ûorramatur, thereby linking it with the tradition of the √ûorrabl√≥t. The idea was well received and the serving of √ûorramatur has since become a defining feature of √ûorrabl√≥t. Today √ûorrabl√≥t are common events among Icelanders everywhere and can be anything from an informal dinner with friends and family to large organised events with stage performances and an after-dinner dance. These large √ûorrabl√≥t celebrations are usually arranged by membership associations, associations of Icelanders living abroad, and as regional festivals in the countryside.

She is best known for her Famine-era historical children's book Under the Hawthorn Tree, the first book of the Children of the Famine trilogy, which was published in 1990 and achieved immediate success. Praised for its child-accessible yet honest depiction of the Great Famine, Under the Hawthorn Tree has been translated into over a dozen languages and is taught in classrooms worldwide. Conlon-McKenna went on to be a prolific writer and has published over 20 books for both young readers and adults. Her debut adult novel Magdalen was published in 1999.  Biography  Conlon-McKenna was born in Dublin and raised in Goatstown. She attended school at the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Mount Anville. She excelled at school but deferred a place at university to care for her father. She married James McKenna at age 20 and had jobs in the family business, in a bank, and with a travel agency. She took an interest in writing and enrolled in writing classes in UCD, including courses in Anglo-Irish literature, women's studies and children's literature. While a mother of young children, she began writing a picture book for her daughter. She credits Dr Pat Donlon, director of the Children's Literature course, with encouraging and supporting her to publish her work. The inspiration for her first children's novel Under the Hawthorn Tree came when she heard a radio report on the discovery of an unmarked grave under a hawthorn tree, where three children from the Famine era were buried. Under the Hawthorn Tree was a worldwide success and sold over 250,000 copies in the Irish market alone, earning its status as a classic children's novel. Conlon-McKenna went on to write more books for young readers. Her characters are often depicted in challenging situations or life events. Among her historical children's books are Safe Harbour, set during World War II, which was shortlisted for the Bisto Book of the Year Award, and two follow-up books to Under the Hawthorn Tree: Wildflower Girl and Fields of Home, which completed the Children of the Famine trilogy. Other children's books include The Blue Horse, which won the Bisto Irish Book of the Year Award and reached the top of the bestseller's list in 1993, No Goodbye, and A Girl Called Blue. Her debut novel for adults, The Magdalen, was a number-one bestseller in 1999, telling the story of a young pregnant woman sent to a Magdalene Laundry in 1950s Ireland. Conlon-McKenna said that she naturally made a shift from children to adult's writing when she decided to write a story about the Magdalene Laundries. This subject interested her because of her personal adoption story. Conlon-McKenna carried out extensive historical research for her 1916-era novel Rebel Sisters. Based on real-life Gifford sisters Nellie, Muriel and Grace, who were involved in the 1916 Rising in Dublin, Rebel Sisters became a number-one bestseller when it was released in 2016 on the centenary year of the 1916 Rising. In 2020, Conlon-McKenna published The Hungry Road, a historical novel set in Skibbereen, Co. Cork during the Great Famine. Published 30 years after Under the Hawthorn Tree, The Hungry Road was inspired partly by the diaries of Dr Daniel Donovan, a dispensary doctor in the Skibbereen Workhouse during the 1840s. Marita and her husband James have four children and they live in Stillorgan in Co. Dublin. She is a promoter of the arts and was the chairperson of Irish PEN.

In 1811 he started in practice on his own account at 32 Old Burlington Street, and soon acquired a reputation second to that of none, either before or since, who have practised the same branch of the healing art. He was as remarkable for the correctness and rapidity of his judgment as he was for marvellous dexterity in all manipulatory processes. During a great part of his career he was in the habit of seeing from forty to fifty patients every day, and this for months together, standing constantly from seven o'clock in the morning until the same hour in the evening, and yet in every case doing what he had to do without the slightest appearance of hurry or fatigue. He did much to improve and elevate his profession, and is said for some years to have been in the receipt of an income of upwards of ¬£10,000. He became a fellow of the Linnean Society on 19 Nov. 1833, a Fellow of the Royal Society on 11 Feb. 1841, and was also a fellow of the Geological Society, but never found time to make any contributions to the Proceedings of these institutions. His pleasing manners, liberal hospitality, and professional fame acquired for him the friendship of nearly all the most distinguished in science, literature, and art of his day. He continued in practice at Old Burlington Street until 1857, when he retired, and in the following year had an apoplectic seizure which resulted in palsy, under which he laboured for the rest of his life. He died at his residence, Nizell's House, near Tonbridge, on 10 June 1864.

There is debate about whether it is one species or two; the second being Ceratocystis virescens. For simplicity, this page will refer to this pathogen as one species. It is also known by its anamorph name Endoconidiophora virescens. a sugar maple with dwarfed leaves, a symptom of sapstreak disease Host and symptoms This fungus is often found as a saprophyte on logs of woody species. It causes sapstreak disease in just one host species: Acer saccharum, commonly known as the sugar maple or rock maple. Symptoms include a sparse crown, dieback, dwarfed leaves, and cankers. Infected trees may die suddenly or languish for 2‚Äì4 years. The symptom most characteristic of sapstreak disease is yellowish-green stained wood that is also very moist. Once the wood is cut and dries, the stains turn light brown, so they're difficult to see and diagnose at that point. Disease cycle As an ascomycete, Ceratocystis coerulescens produces ascospores encased as groups of eight in asci. The asci are protected by a perithecium, a flask-shaped ascocarp, in which the pathogen overwinters. Ascospores are the sexual spores and are far less common than the asexual spores known as conidia. The conidia form on conidiophores without a sporocarp. C. coerulescens has two mating types referred to as Mat-1 and Mat-2, but it is not a strictly heterothalic species. The Mat-1 type is self-sterile and must cross with Mat-2 to produce perithecia. However, the Mat-2 type is self-fertile and half of the progeny from a Mat-2 selfing are Mat-1. Environment Sapstreak disease has occurred only in North America and primarily in sugar bushes, stands of Acer saccharum that are tapped for maple sap. There has been a single report of it in Ontario, Canada; and cases in the U.S. have been from California, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Vermont, and Wisconsin. As with all fungi, it requires a moist environment to sporulate. a wounded buttress root with the characteristic stain of sapstreak disease Pathogenesis Ceratocystis coerulescens enters its host through wounds, especially wounds in buttress roots and lower trunk. All diseased trees have been found to have man-made wounds from tapping and/or driving and dragging logs over them. Therefore it‚Äôs believed that the trees successfully combat the pathogen when it enters wounds higher up made by animals, insects, or weather. Sapstreak disease is commonly associated with the presence of opportunistic fungi Armillaria and/or Xylaria. Importance Sapstreak threatens maple syrup production primarily, but also ruins the wood for making lumber. The economic and environmental damage due to this pathogen is currently meager. Most instances have occurred after incautious logging and have been well contained. Usually a single tree or a small group is affected. Management The best way to manage this disease is to prevent it by avoiding injuries to the roots and lower stems of sugar maples. This can be accomplished by using the same, well-placed trails every year through the sugar bush and by using tubing systems instead of buckets to collect sap. When infection does occur, the tree should be cut down and the wood promptly removed to reduce inoculum.

She was built at Portsmouth and launched on 26 February 1891. She first served as the flagship of the Pacific Station from 1893 to 1896, before being refitted at Portsmouth in 1897. She then served as the flagship of the Australian Station from 1897 to 1904.Bastock, p.117-118. In that role she provided escort for the royal yacht carrying the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (the future King George V and Queen Mary) to Australia to open the new Federal Parliament in 1901. Captain Thomas Philip Walker was appointed in command in April 1901. She visited Norfolk Island in July 1902, and Suva, Fiji the following month. Captain Richard Purefoy FitzGerald Purefoy was appointed to the ship in October 1902, but did not take command until early in 1903, after Vice Admiral Arthur Dalrymple Fanshawe had taken command of the Australia Station. She left the Australia Station on 6 April 1904 and was paid off and refitted at Portsmouth. She recommissioned in 1905 and served on the North America and West Indies Station before returning to England in 1906.

It is a brick building erected in the late 19th century. Abraham Lincoln gave a speech at this site during his train ride to Washington after being elected, his only public appearance in Westchester County. No longer in use as a depot, the building is the only intact freight-only station building along the route of the former Hudson River Railroad. In 2004, the station was added to the National Register of Historic Places, and in 2014 it was converted into the Lincoln Depot Museum. Building The depot building is closer to the tracks and their chainlink fencing than it is to Water Street. Across the tracks is a park which lies along the Hudson River. The neighborhood is primarily commercial, with other old industrial buildings. It is a one-story masonry structure faced in common- bond brick with a shallow-pitched gabled roof. The roof eave extends eight feet (2.2 m) over the elevated platform to shelter handlers while loading and unloading freight. It is supported by brackets and has decorative vergeboards at the north and south gable ends. The brick itself has segmented pilasters between the bays and some corbeling. Before its conversion into a museum, the interior of the building retained much of its original trim, including the cement floor, wainscoting, exposed trusswork ceiling and reed molding and bullseye corner blocks around the doors. History The first depot was built of wood around 1850 by the Hudson River Railroad to handle freight shipments into and out of what was then a busy industrial Hudson River city.Lincoln Society of Peekskill; 2007; Lincoln Depot Museum; retrieved June 17, 2007.) Around 1890 the present brick depot was built by the New York Central Railroad; at that time its platform had extensions to the north and south along the tracks. There are some reports of fires in the 1880s and again in 1898; and blistering of the interior paint at roof level gives evidence that there was one. On February 19, 1861, Abraham Lincoln stopped here during his train trip to his inauguration and gave a brief speech at the invitation of local congressman William Nelson, who introduced him. Contemporary newspaper accounts suggest that approximately 1500 people were present, equivalent to about half the population of Peekskill at that time, to hear his brief request for their support in the coming crisis - four states had already seceded from the Union by then. It was Lincoln's only recorded appearance in Westchester County. The depot after being converted into the Lincoln Depot Museum Peekskill has embraced Lincoln's appearance as a celebrated part of its history. A memorial stone, the Lincoln Exedra, was erected on South Street, overlooking the depot, in 1925. The speech was commemorated at its 50th anniversary in 1911, and again on its centennial in 1961. The latter occasion featured a re-enactment of the speech, with actors dressed as Lincoln and Nelson. The Lincoln Society of Peekskill keeps the memory alive and organizes other activities related to its namesake. The railroad no longer exists, and the building fell vacant as Peekskill's industrial base declined to the point that freight shipments were no longer made; the line itself is now the Metro- North Hudson commuter line, handling almost exclusively passenger traffic. Lincoln Depot Museum In April 2005, then New York State Governor, George Pataki - the former mayor of Peekskill - secured the initial funding for the Lincoln Depot Museum to be housed in the freight depot building. Groundbreaking for the project took place on February 9, 2011, by which time the Lincoln Depot Foundation had secured approximately $3 million. The building';s restoration was completed in May 2013, with help from New York's Office of Historic Preservation. The museum opened to the public on October 18, 2014.

John Cage, a pioneer of indeterminacy, defined it as \\"the ability of a piece to be performed in substantially different ways\\". The earliest significant use of music indeterminacy features is found in many of the compositions of American composer Charles Ives in the early 20th century. Henry Cowell adopted Ives‚Äôs ideas during the 1930s, in works allowing players to arrange the fragments of music in a number of different possible sequences. Beginning in the early 1950s, the term came to refer to the (mostly American) movement which grew up around Cage. This group included the other members of the New York School. In Europe, following the introduction of the expression \\"aleatory music\\" by Meyer-Eppler, the French composer Pierre Boulez was largely responsible for popularizing the term. Definition Describing indeterminacy, composer John Cage said: \\"My intention is to let things be themselves.\\" Cage initially defined indeterminacy as \\"the ability of a piece to be performed in substantially different ways\\" . Bryan Simms thus conflates indeterminacy with what Cage called chance composition when he claims that \\"Any part of a musical work is indeterminate if it is chosen by chance, or if its performance is not precisely specified. The former case is called 'indeterminacy of composition'; the latter is called 'indeterminacy of performance'.\\" History The earliest significant use of music indeterminacy features is found in many of the compositions of American composer Charles Ives in the early 20th century. Henry Cowell adopted Ives's ideas during the 1930s, in such works as the Mosaic Quartet (String Quartet No. 3, 1934), which allows the players to arrange the fragments of music in a number of different possible sequences. Cowell also used specially devised notations to introduce variability into the performance of a work, sometimes instructing the performers to improvise a short passage or play ad libitum. John Cage is regarded as a pioneer of indeterminacy in music. Beginning in the early 1950s, the term came to refer to the (mostly American) movement which grew up around Cage. This group included the other members of the so-called New York School: Earle Brown, Morton Feldman and Christian Wolff. Others working in this way included the Scratch Orchestra in the United Kingdom (1968 until the early 1970s) and the Japanese composer Toshi Ichiyanagi (born 1933). In Europe, following the introduction of the expression \\"aleatory music\\" by Werner Meyer-Eppler, the French composer Pierre Boulez was largely responsible for popularizing the term (; ). In 1958 Cage gave two lectures in Europe, the first at Darmstadt, titled simply \\"Indeterminacy\\" , the second in Brussels called \\"Indeterminacy: New Aspect of Form in Instrumental and Electronic Music\\" (given again in an expanded form in 1959 at Teacher's College, Columbia). This second lecture consisted of a number of short stories (originally 30, expanded to ninety in the second version), each story read by Cage in exactly one minute; because of this time limit, the speed of Cage's delivery varied enormously . The second performance and a subsequent recording contained music, also by Cage, played by David Tudor at the same time. Subsequently, Cage added still more stories, and published a selection of them, partly as an article, \\"Indeterminacy\\" , and partly as scattered interludes throughout his first collection of writings, Silence . Between 2007 and 2013, the Dutch artist Iebele Abel developed an electronic instrument called Real-time Indeterminate Synthetic Music Feedback (RT-ISMF). The instrument was designed for empirical research on subjective experiences induced by real-time synthesized music, based on the output of electronic random number generators. The basic idea of this approach was that indeterminate music might evoke unique and exceptional human experience . Classification Indeterminate or chance music can be divided into three groups: (1) the use of random procedures to produce a determinate, fixed score, (2) mobile form, and (3) indeterminate notation, including graphic notation and texts. The first group includes scores in which the chance element is involved only in the process of composition, so that every parameter is fixed before their performance. In John Cage‚Äôs Music of Changes (1951), the process of composition involved applying decisions made using the I Ching, a Chinese classic text that is commonly used as a divination system. The I Ching was applied to large charts of sounds, durations, dynamics, tempo and densities. Cage himself, however, regarded Music of Changes as a determinate work, because it is completely fixed from one performance to another . Iannis Xenakis used probability theories to define some microscopic aspects of Pithoprakta (1955‚Äì56), that is the Greek for \\"actions by means of probability\\". This work contains four sections, characterized by textural and timbral attributes, such as glissandi and pizzicati. At the macroscopic level, the sections are designed and controlled by the composer, but the single components of sound are generated by mathematical theories . See: stochastic music. In the second type of indeterminate music (the only type of indeterminate music according to Cage's definition), chance elements involve the performance. Notated events are provided by the composer, but their arrangement is left to the determination of the performer. According to Cage, examples include Johann Sebastian Bach's Art of Fugue, Morton Feldman's Intersection 3, Earle Brown's Four Systems, and Christian Wolff's Duo for Pianists II . A form of limited indeterminacy was used by Witold Lutos≈Çawski (beginning with Jeux v√©nitiens in 1960‚Äì61) , where extensive passages of pitches and rhythms are fully specified, but the rhythmic coordination of parts within the ensemble is subject to an element of chance. Earle Brown‚Äôs Twenty-Five Pages, uses 25 unbound pages, and called for anywhere between one and 25 pianists. The score allowed the performer(s) to arrange the pages in whatever order they saw fit. Also, the pages were notated symmetrically and without clefs so that the top and bottom orientation is reversible. \\"Open form\\" is a term sometimes used for \\"mobile\\" or \\"polyvalent\\" musical forms, where the order of movements or sections is indeterminate or left up to the performer. Roman Haubenstock-Ramati composed a series of influential \\"mobiles\\" such as Interpolation (1958). However, \\"open form\\" in music is also used in the sense defined by the art historian Heinrich W√∂lfflin (1915) to mean a work which is fundamentally incomplete, represents an unfinished activity, or points outside of itself. In this sense, a \\"mobile form\\" can be either \\"open\\" or \\"closed\\". An example of a \\"dynamic, closed\\" mobile musical composition is Karlheinz Stockhausen's Zyklus (1959) . Terry Riley's In C (1964) was composed of 53 short sequences; each member of the ensemble can repeat a given sequence as many times as desired before going on to the next, making the details of each performance of In C unique. However, because the overall course is fixed, it is a closed form. The greatest degree of indeterminacy is reached by the third type of indeterminate music, in graphic score pieces, in which the music is represented using symbols and illustrations suggesting how a work can be performed. Hans-Christoph Steiner's score for Solitude, created using Pure Data's data structures.This notation may be, like music on traditional staves, a time-pitch graph system. Earle Brown's December 1952 consists purely of horizontal and vertical lines varying in width, spread out over the page; it is a landmark piece in the history of graphic notation of music. The role of the performer is to interpret the score visually and translate the graphical information to music. In Brown's notes on the work he even suggests that one consider this 2D space as 3D and imagine moving through it. Cornelius Cardew's Treatise is a graphic musical score comprising 193 pages of lines, symbols, and various geometric or abstract shapes that generally eschew conventional musical notation. Although the score allows for absolute interpretive freedom (no one interpretation will sound like another), the work is not normally played spontaneously, as Cardew had previously suggested that performers devise in advance their own rules and methods for interpreting and performing the work. There are, however, infinite possibilities for the interpretation of Treatise that fall within the implications of the piece and general principles of experimental music performance in the late 1960s, including presentation as visual art and map-reading.

He served in the Irish South American legion and the Austrian army. He was MP for Meath from 1832 until 1840 and afterwards assistant-registrar of deeds for Ireland from 1840 until 1868. He did not agree with his father on the repeal question, but fought a duel with Lord Arden, on his father's account. Biography O'Connell, second son of Daniel O'Connell, was born at 30 Merrion Square, Dublin, 31 October 1804. In 1819, self-styled General came to Dublin to enlist military aid for Sim√≥n Bol√≠var's army to liberate Venezuela from Spanish rule. He succeeded in forming an Irish Legion, to be part of Bolivar's British Legions; and O'Connell, encouraged by his father, was one of the officers who purchased a commission in it even though only 15 years old. The enterprise was mismanaged; there was no commissariat organisation on board the ships, and a part of the force died on the voyage. The remainder were disembarked on the Spanish Main at Margarita Island, where many deaths took place from starvation eight days after the Irish mutineers left for Jamaica. Bolivar, who had noted his pleasure at the departure of \\"these vile mercenaries\\", was too astute a diplomat to offend the son of his Irish counterpart. Morgan was accorded the appropriate privileges of his rank, and toasts were drunk to the health of his father, the \\"most enlightened man in all Europe\\". A portion of the expedition, under Francis O' Connor, effected an alliance with Bolivar, and to the energy of these allies the republican successes were chiefly due. Bolivar made sure that the untrained Irish lad stayed out of danger. \\"I have numberless hardships to go through,\\" said Bolivar, \\"which I would not bring him into, for the character of his father is well known to me.\\" But ceremonial duties soon bored the restless young Irishman, and after a year at Bolivar's headquarters Morgan left for Ireland. If South America did not satisfy Morgan's taste for adventure, he had more than his fill on the return journey. He survived a bout of tropical fever, and was shipwrecked twice in succession, ending up stranded in Cuba. A schooner captain, who turned out to be a long-lost Irish cousin, rescued him. After the captain was killed in a fight with his boatswain, Morgan hitched a ride to Jamaica on a Danish ship commanded by a skipper from Cork. From Jamaica, another Irish officer offered Morgan passage home on a British Islands. Arriving in January 1822, Morgan was greeted by his proud father as a prodigal son returned. His South American adventure, declared Daniel O'Connell, had made a man of Morgan. Otherwise, said O'Connell, \\"it would have been difficult to tame him down to the sobriety of business.\\" O'Connell after his return to Ireland again to seek foreign service in the Austrian army. On 19 December 1832 he entered parliament in the Liberal interest, as one of the members for Meath, and continued to represent that constituency till January 1840, when he was appointed first assistant- registrar of deeds for Ireland, at a salary of ¬£1,200 a year, a place which he held till 1868. In politics he was never in perfect accord with his father, and his retirement from parliament was probably caused by his inability to accept the Repeal movement. During his parliamentary career he fought a duel with Lord William Arden, 2nd Baron Alvanley, a captain in the British Army, at Chalk Farm, on 4 May 1835. A challenge had been sent by Alvanley to O'Connell's father, who, in accordance with a vow he had made after shooting D'Esterre, declined the meeting. Morgan thereupon took up the challenge. Two shots each were exchanged, but no one was hurt. He afterwards, in December 1835, received a challenge from Benjamin Disraeli, in consequence of an attack made on Disraeli by Morgan's father. Morgan declined to meet Disraeli. Family Morgan O'Connell was one of seven children (and the second of four sons) of the Irish Nationalist leader Daniel and Mary O'Connell. His brothers Maurice, John and Daniel were also MPs. O'Connell married, on 23 July 1840, Kate Mary, youngest daughter of Michael Balfe of South Park, County Roscommon. He died at 12 St. Stephen's Green, Dublin, 20 January 1885, and was buried in Glasnevin cemetery on 23 January.

In 1991, Axa, a French insurance company, acquired majority control of The Equitable. In 2004, it officially changed its name to AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company. By 2018, the company had over 15,800 agents licensed by the State of California. In January 2020 it changed its name back to Equitable following its spinoff from AXA and the related public offerings beginning in May 2018. History Equitable Building at 120 Broadway on an old postcard Equitable Life Insurance opened its headquarters at the Equitable Life Building in 1870 in the Financial District of Manhattan, with entrances facing Broadway, Pine Street, and Cedar Street. Aside from Hyde, who was president of Equitable, the firm's officers included James Waddell Alexander (Vice President), George W. Phillips (Actuary) who was Vice President of the Actuarial Society of America, and Samuel Borrowe (Secretary). Borrowe's family was a prominent New York family connected to the Hallett and Alsop families. Between 1889 and 1891 the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States built in the Innere Stadt of Vienna, Austria, the sumptuous Palais Equitable, a mansion at Stock- im-Eisen-Platz in the city center next to the Stephansplatz. James Waddell Alexander, the son of James Waddel Alexander, was the company president at the time of the Hyde costume ball scandal in 1905, in which James Hazen Hyde, the son of the founder and a vice president of the company, was falsely accused through a media smear campaign initiated by Alexander and board directors E. H. Harriman, Henry Clay Frick, J.P. Morgan of charging a fabulous $200,000 costume ball to the company. The repercussions rocked Wall Street, and resulted in an investigation of the entire insurance industry by the State of New York. After the company's headquarters building burned down in 1912, Equitable erected Equitable Building on the same site in Manhattan. In 1943, during World War II, Equitable began underwriting policies for the War Agencies Employees Protective Association to provide group life insurance to U.S. Government employees working in or around war zones. Through WAEPA Equitable sold policies to employees of some 40 U.S. agencies, including individuals from the Offices of Strategic Services and War Information, which often sent their men behind enemy lines, and air-traveling statesmen and Congressmen. By May 1945 only 24 death claims had been filed, (about half the normal peacetime rate for a group plan covering 7,000 workers) allowing the insurer to return roughly 30% of the premiums to WAEPA.INSURANCE: Bad Risks, Good Record, Time (May 28, 1945 Vol. XLV No.22) In 1985, the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, then the third largest life insurance company in the country, formed Equitable Real Estate Investment Management, a subsidiary used by Equitable Life to develop and finance new real estate projects and manage the US$20 billion worth of real estate under Equitable's control. In December 1990, Equitable announced its decision to demutualize under New York's liberalizing laws. This was intended to enable the Equitable to increase and diversify its asset base. On July 18, 1991, AXA Group of France bought a $1 billion stake in Equitable Life Assurance Society, for a 49% stake in the business. This enabled Equitable to set aside $500 million for losses in its real estate and junk bond portfolios. There had been rumors that Equitable was nearing a bankruptcy filing prior to the AXA Group infusion of capital. The investment by AXA Group significantly altered the trajectory of both companies. By 1997, the assets of the U.S. operation, the Equitable Insurance Group, had reach nearly a quarter of a billion dollars, and by 2003, AXA Equitable Insurance Company was the leading carrier in the world with more than 50 million clients, in more than 50 countries, and with nearly a trillion dollars in client assets.http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/the- equitable-life-assurance-society-of-the-united-states-history/ By 2018, AXA, facing tougher European Solvency laws, decided to re-balance its operations from life and annuities and towards property and casualty - from financial risks to insurance risks. As a result, the company decided to begin the process to spin-off the U.S. operations, the old Equitable Life Assurance company. In its filing, AXA noted that once the IPO took place, there would be four separate companies created: AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company, AXA Distribution Holding Corp., EQ AZ Life Re Company, and MONY Life Insurance Company of America.https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2018/03/05/axa-talks-more- about-u-s-life-spinoff/ In May 2018, AXA announced the successful completion of the IPO of AXA Equitable Holdings, raising $2.75 billion on the sale of 24.5% of the outstanding shares. Additionally, the company announced an issuance of $750 million of bonds mandatorily exchangeable into shares of AXA Equitable Holdings stock. And finally, $502 million of options were exercised bringing the total to $4.02 billion in proceeds to AXA.https://www.axa.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/axa-has-successfully- completed-the-ipo-of-axa-equitable-holdings-inc-and-secured-the-financing-of- the-acquisition-of-xl-group On March 25, 2019, AXA announced a successful completion of a secondary common stock offering of 40 million shares AXA Equitable Holdings, Inc. (ticker EQH) bringing down their ownership stake from approximately 60% to 48.3% and raising net proceeds of $1.5 billion.https://www.axa.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/axa-sa-announces-the- successful-completion-of-a-secondary-common-stock-offering-of On November 7, 2019, AXA announced the sale of its remaining stake in AXA Equitable Holdings (EQH), selling 144 million shares of common stock to Goldman Sachs who was the sole underwriter for the public offering of the shares. The expected close date was stated by the company at the time as November 13, 2019. This brings to a close a long and largely successful chapter in the Equitable's history - the end of the AXA Group ownership of the company.https://www.axa.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/axa-sa-announces-the- sale-of-its-remaining-stake-in-axa-equitable-holdings-inc On January 14, 2020, Equitable unveiled its new branding.

She was born on March 20, 1908 in Lemgo, Germany, but grew up in East Prussia. She took a pen name, Osten (German for \\"East\\") to indicate her pro-Soviet sympathies. Osten was born Maria Emilie Alwine Gressh√∂ner in Muckum bei B√ºnde, Westphalia, Germany, the daughter of Anna Maria (Pohlmann) and Heinrich Gressh√∂ner.http://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs- transcripts-and-maps/osten-maria-1908-1942 Maria Osten was most famous for her 1935 book Hubert in Wonderland (\\"–ì—É–±–µ—Ä—Ç –≤ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ —á—É–¥–µ—Å\\" - Russian) and the events surrounding its publication in the Soviet Union. The story is about a 12-year-old boy who is the son of German Communist from the Saar region of Germany. The boy is adopted by a Soviet journalist for Pravda, Mikhail Koltsov, and his partner, the German journalist Maria Osten, who took the boy in 1935 to the Soviet Union. The boy's arrival in the Soviet Union was a very highly publicized event at the time, as it was a demonstration of the cooperation of fellow Communists to save a young boy from having to grow up in Nazi Germany. The boy was toured all around the country and he was even taken to visit Marshals Mikhail Tukhachevsky and Semyon Budyonny in the Kremlin. The family's fate, however, changed, when Joseph Stalin began to purge the party ranks. Koltsov was arrested in December 1938 following a denunciation filed in by Andr√© Marty and executed about a year later, and the book disappeared from circulation. Hubert then refused to recognize his adoptive parents and told his adoptive mother to leave him. In 1941, Maria Osten was arrested in the hotel Balchug, and never heard from again. (In fact, Maria Osten was executed in Saratov prison on September 16, 1942). Hubert was deported to the Kazakh SSR, where he became a shepherd. He was arrested in 1946 and freed only in 1955, two years after Stalin's death. Hubert tried to return to Germany, but never succeeded, dying in 1959 in a hospital in Simferopol after a poorly performed operation for appendicitis.

It is known geographically as the state's Coastal Plain region. Primary subregions of Eastern North Carolina include the Sandhills, the Lower Cape Fear (Wilmington Area), the Crystal Coast, the Inner Banks and the Outer Banks. It is composed of the 41 most eastern counties in the state. Large cities include Greenville, Jacksonville, and Wilmington. In 1993, the State Legislature established seven regional economic development organizations and three of these serve eastern North Carolina - Northeast North Carolina Commission (covering 16 counties), North Carolina East Alliance (representing 13 counties surrounding North Carolina's Global TransPark), and North Carolina's Southeast Commission (assisting 11 counties). New transitions are being made in the geography of the economic sectors. Economic Development Commissions are transforming, such as North Carolina's Eastern Region Commission's transition into North Carolina East Alliance. Different EDC's have different ways to increase prosperity in the area. NCEA's first focus is to improve the talent pipeline to create a more comprehensive local workforce. Shoop, the Commissioner for Washington's EDC stated \\"In a private setting, they would be able to access different funds for additional economic projects or initiatives in the county.\\" Located east of the Piedmont and west of the Atlantic Ocean, Eastern North Carolina contains very few major urban centers. Greenville is close to the region's geographic center. Fayetteville is the largest city in the region, followed by Wilmington and Greenville.  Geography  Eastern North Carolina is roughly made up of the 44 easternmost counties in North Carolina. Generally, the region denotes all of the state's counties on and east of Interstate 95 (also known as East Coast USA Main Street stretching from northern Maine to the southern tip of Florida). If defined by geological formations, eastern North Carolina comprises the 44 counties of the Inner and Outer Coastal Plains. In terms of economic similarities, the region includes 41 counties. The commonly accepted definition is all counties east of and crossed by Interstate 95, which is 41 counties. I-95 intersects with US64/264 at Wilson County and is in close proximity to I-40. This makes transportation throughout the region incredible along with easy access to the rest of the state and country. The region is further divisible into three geographic sections: the Southeast, Inner Banks and the Outer Banks.  History  The coast of North Carolina were dominated by Native Americans, primarily the Tuscarora people residing near modern Snow Hill. Eastern North Carolina is also home to the first attempted English settlement in the New World on Roanoke Island. During the colonial era of American History, the East was the dominant region of North Carolina in both government and commerce. Towns of early significance included Bath, Beaufort, Elizabeth City, Edenton, Kinston, New Bern, Tarboro, and Wilmington. North Carolina's early economy was built upon cash crops, fisheries and turpentine industries. Early East Carolinians lived on settlements at the mouths of the various rivers. Settlers to the regions were of English, Scottish, Swiss and German descent. Eastern North Carolina was a haven for pirating and home to the infamous pirate Blackbeard. The city of New Bern was founded in 1710 by settlers from the Palantine region of Germany, and later became the colonial capital. Around the end of the eighteenth century, however, such dominance shifted to the Piedmont center of the state. The growth in population of the western and piedmont regions of North Carolina after the American Revolution led to revisions of the Constitution of North Carolina in 1835. These amendments included electing the governor by popular vote.  Education  =Four-year institutions= The region is dotted with universities. There are five public universities and seven private institutions in the region. The largest is East Carolina University, a Doctoral University with Higher Research Activity on the Carnegie scale. The four other public universities are Elizabeth City State University, Fayetteville State University, University of North Carolina at Pembroke, and University of North Carolina at Wilmington. The seven private institutions are: Barton College, Campbell University, Chowan University, Methodist University, University of Mount Olive, North Carolina Wesleyan College, and Mid-Atlantic Christian University. =Community colleges= The area is also served by 23 community colleges. The two-year institutes are: Beaufort County Community College, Bladen Community College, Brunswick Community College, Cape Fear Community College, Carteret Community College, College of the Albemarle, Coastal Carolina Community College, Craven Community College, Edgecombe Community College, Fayetteville Technical Community College, James Sprunt Community College, Johnston Community College, Lenoir Community College, Roanoke-Chowan Community College, Martin Community College, Nash Community College, Pamlico Community College, Pitt Community College, Sampson Community College, Sandhills Community College, Southeastern Community College, Wayne Community College, and Wilson Community College. Many community colleges hold programs to create a more able workforce in Eastern North Carolina. The different economic clusters, including but not limited to advanced manufacturing (aerospace, automotive and industrial machinery), life sciences (Biopharma and medical device research, development and manufacturing), value-added agriculture (food processing, forest products, etc.) and marine products (boat building) have prompted Community Colleges to offer associate degrees in related fields (e.g. Airframe/power plant maintenance, composite technology, engineering technology, biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturing technology, machining and welding).  Transportation  Eastern North Carolina is served by two main interstate highways and a number of U.S. routes. =Road Transportation= *Interstate 95 is the rough western edge of Eastern North Carolina passing through Rocky Mount, Wilson, Fayetteville and Lumberton. *Interstate 40 serves the southeastern portion from Wayne County (Near Mt . Olive) to Wilmington in New Hanover County. *I-795 is the main highway between Wilson and Goldsboro. *U.S. 13 enters North Carolina close to the Drum Hill community. It proceeds through Greenville and terminates into I-95 in Fayetteville. *U.S. 17 enters North Carolina from Virginia beside the Dismal Swamp State Park. It continues through Washington, New Bern, and Wilmington and exits the state near Calabash onwards to South Carolina. *U.S. 64 enters Rocky Mount from Raleigh. It continues to the eastern terminus in Nags Head. *U.S. 70 enters the region at Selma. It continues through Goldsboro, Kinston, New Bern and Morehead City (deepwater port) on its way to the eastern terminus at the village of Atlantic. Just before reaching Atlantic, the highway connects with NC12 that leads to the Cedar Island/Okracoke Ferry that connects to the famous Outer Banks. *U.S. 74 begins in Wrightsville Beach. The route stays close to the South Carolina line and exits the region near Lumberton. *U.S. 76 runs concurrent with U.S. 74 from Wrightsville Beach to Chadbourn. It exits the state near Fair Buff into South Carolina. *U.S. 117 is an offshoot of U.S. 17, beginning at I-95 in Wilson and terminating at the Port of Wilmington. *The eastern terminus of U.S. 158 is in Nags Head. It continues through Elizabeth City, then it exits the area, crossing I-95 close to Roanoke Rapids. *Jacksonville is the southern terminus of U.S. 258. It continues north through Kinston and Tarboro, exiting the state near Mill Neck. *The eastern terminus of U.S. 264 is at U.S. 64 at Manns Harbor. It continues south to Swan Quarter, even though it doesn't go through the town. It then goes west through Washington and bypasses Greenville. It leaves Eastern North Carolina at I-95 in Wilson. *US 301 closely parallels I-95 throughout North Carolina. It enters the state from South Carolina, crossing over I-95 near Rowland. It leaves the state near Pleasant Hill on its way to Virginia. *US 401 serves Harnett, Cumberland, Hoke, and Scotland counties. *US 421 enters the region in Harnett County and terminates at Carolina Beach. *US 701's northern terminus is in Four Oaks. It continues south through Newton Grove and Clinton and exits the state near Tabor City. Over 60 motor freight carriers provide service to all parts of the nation. FedEx, UPS, DHL and Emery have offices in all major communities. The transportation within the region allows for easy access to anywhere in the continental United States of America. I-40 and I-95 are capable of this with close proximity to I-85 as well. Manufacturers can move their goods efficiently and families can travel with ease. Much of the region's main highways have been designated as the Historic Albemarle Tour, which connects many historic sites in Eastern North Carolina. =Rail Transportation= CSX, Norfolk Southern, and the NC Railroad Company serve the industries within the region. The National Railroad Passenger Corporation, Amtrak, is a train service for passengers. Amtrak passenger stations are located in Rocky Mount, Wilson and throughout North Carolina and the Eastern region =Air Transportation= Wilmington International Airport is in Eastern North Carolina along with RDU within a short driving distance. Raleigh-Durham International can be reached via i-40 (with i-440 or 540 being additional options). There are several ways to access Wilmington International easily when in the region, using i-40 or US-17. There are also sixteen regional airports that serve general aviation in the Eastern region of North Carolina: Greenville, Jacksonville and New Bern provide commuter service to Charlotte, Atlanta, Cincinnati and Philadelphia. Global Transpark The North Carolina Global TransPark (GTP) is a 2,500 acre, multi-modal industrial park offering unparalleled access to air, rail, highways, and North Carolina's two international ports. The GTP boasts a pro-business climate aimed at growing the aerospace, logistics, manufacturing, emergency services, defense contracting and supporting industries. Ports There are deep-water bulk, break-bulk cargo and container facilities in ENC at Morehead City, NC and Wilmington, NC. A third comprehensive deep-water (Panamx-ready) port exists just north of the state line in Norfolk/Portsmouth, VA. All three ports also have RoRo (roll-on, roll-off) facilities to handle autos and military equipment.  Government  The local government of Eastern North Carolina is served by seven of the 16 North Carolina Councils of Government. They include the Upper Coastal Plain Council of Governments, Mid-Carolina Council of Governments, Lumber River Council of Governments, Cape Fear Council of Governments, Eastern Carolina Council of Governments, Mid-East Commission, and the Albemarle Commission.  Socio-economic  Eastern North Carolina is by and large an impoverished area. Nearly 21 percent of people live in poverty in this region. Outsourcing of textile manufacturing jobs along with other manufacturing jobs has caused unemployment in the area to increase particularly in the northeastern area of the state. Many areas of Eastern North Carolina are experiencing little economic growth; however, areas such as Greenville and Winterville (Pitt County) are growing rapidly due to the location of East Carolina University and its associated medical facilities. Fleet Readiness Center East on board Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point is the largest industrial employer east of Interstate-95, with an annual payroll of $277 Million.http://www.navair.navy.mil/frce/history.html  Topography  Eastern North Carolina is located in the coastal plain region of the eastern seaboard of the United States and has relatively flat land that is primarily used for farming. The Outer Banks and Inner Banks are comparable to the tidewater region of Virginia in terms of land. However, the barrier islands of the Outer Banks are highly rare.  Area  Eastern North Carolina generally consists of 41 counties, which when combined form a total regional area of roughly 9,700 square miles (25000 square km). The counties commonly included in the region are as follows: #Bertie County #Beaufort County #Bladen County #Brunswick County #Camden County #Carteret County #Chowan County #Columbus County #Craven County #Cumberland County #Currituck County #Dare County #Duplin County #Edgecombe County #Gates County #Greene County #Halifax County #Harnett County #Hertford County #Hoke County #Hyde County #Johnston County #Jones County #Lenoir County #Martin County #Nash County #New Hanover County #Northampton County #Onslow County #Pamlico County #Pender County #Pasquotank County #Perquimans County #Pitt County #Robeson County #Sampson County #Scotland County #Tyrrell County #Washington County #Wayne County #Wilson County =Cities and towns= Eastern North Carolina communities in the region include: Over 50,000 in population *Fayetteville *Greenville *Jacksonville *Rocky Mount *Wilmington Fewer than 50,000 population  References   See also  *Inner Banks *Outer Banks *Fayetteville Metropolitan Area *Lower Cape Fear Category:Regions of North Carolina ","title":"Eastern North Carolina"},{"id":"11820772","title":"Pleurotus dryinus"},{"id":"11820778","title":"40 Hour Week (For a Livin')"},{"id":"11820806","text":"\\"Little Orphan Millie\\" is the sixth episode of The Simpsons' nineteenth season. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 11, 2007. This episode represents a milestone in Simpsons' history as it sees Kirk and Luann remarry after initially divorcing eleven seasons earlier. It was written by Mick Kelly, production assistant to Al Jean, and directed by Lance Kramer. During its first broadcast, the episode garnered 10.57 million viewers. Episode News: Little Orphan Millie Plot Kirk and Luann tell The Simpsons they are going to be remarried, much to the delight of Milhouse. While preparing for the wedding, Marge suggests to Homer that he match his tie to her eyes, to which he casually replies that he never notices petty details like eye color. Shocked, Marge covers her eyes so Homer cannot see them unless he remembers their color. While the Van Houtens are on their cruise honeymoon, Kirk carries Luann down the hallway to their private room. The boat begins swinging from side to side, and the two fall off the boat. Two of the cruise representatives tell Milhouse his parents are lost at sea and presumed deceased, throwing Milhouse even deeper into depression. As he sulks around the Simpsons' house, he is informed the search has stopped. After sucking upon Maggie's bottle, he discovers he truly is the \\"world's oldest baby\\", and promises himself that he will soon become a true man. Meanwhile, Homer continues making fruitless attempts at looking for traces of hints that can help him discover the color of Marge's eyes. Milhouse starts to behave depressingly, and dresses in a black jacket and jeans. Milhouse's new behavior and attitude (gloomy, mellow, and poetic) grabs the attention of the girls at school, including Lisa. Milhouse starts usurping Bart's popularity, which aggravates Bart. After concluding that Milhouse with family would be happy again, Bart remembers that Milhouse gets Danish butter cookies every Christmas from Solvang, California. He decides to connect Milhouse with his Danish uncle, Norbert van Houten. Waiting at the airport, Uncle Norbert, dressed like Indiana Jones (including hat and bullwhip) arrives by his own biplane, and asks to be referred to as \\"Zack,\\" the proud Danish Van Houten with a hatred towards the Dutch Van Houtens. After Zack arrives to get Milhouse from the school, Milhouse's popularity escalates even higher. Feeling desperate about finding Marge's eye color, Homer remembers a song he used to sing to Marge, and remembers every word except when he sings about her eyes, searching in vain for the missing word that rhymes with such lyrics as \\"appraisal\\". Marge remembers the song and, touched, removes her sun glasses, revealing the eyes that Homer's song called \\"a beautiful, deep shade of hazel.\\" An angry Bart soon discovers Milhouse plans to fly away in a hot air balloon with Zack. After being convinced by Lisa, Bart realizes that he platonically loves and will miss Milhouse. Milhouse, Zack, and Bart take off in the hot air balloon and come upon an island, where a very much alive Kirk and Luann plan escaping with a nature-made hang-glider. After flying, Kirk and Luann's hang-glider cuts the hot air balloon and soon, Milhouse re-unites with his parents. Zack states that he has already called for help and then gets into a fight with Kirk over their heritage (Danish and Dutch respectively). Cultural references The episode's name references Little Orphan Annie. Milhouse's uncle Zack resembles Indiana Jones and when he flies Milhouse home, music similar to \\"The Raiders March\\" from the Indiana Jones film Raiders of the Lost Ark is heard. Milhouse's somber ensemble is similar to James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause. \\"Adagio for Strings\\" is played during the dark and gloomy scene showing the cruise line representatives driving toward the Simpsons' house. The scene itself is a parody of a scene from Saving Private Ryan, where Mrs. Ryan is informed of the death of her sons. The name \\"Festival Cruise Lines\\" is a parody of Carnival Cruise Lines. The \\"Solvang Air\\" liner plane is a wooden and scantling-work structure with wind-mill wings as propellers, and Uncle Zak and Milhouse's father end by reviving an old hatred between Dutch and Danish. The wooden plane's landing is accompanied with music from \\"Swedish Rhapsody No. 1\\" by Swedish composer Hugo Alfv√©n. Bart and Marge both use the term Krumping in reference to an energetic dancing style that was popularized in the United States. Reception The episode originally garnered 10.6 million viewers on its first run, that being the third highest of the season. Robert Canning of IGN stated that overall, \\"Little Orphan Millie‚Äô was a middle-of-the-road episode that will never really stand out.‚ÄùIGN: Little Orphan Millie Richard Keller of TVSquad.com said \\"For the most part the episode was entertaining and fairly free of over-the-top sight gags\\" The scene in the episode were Marge tries to cheer up Bart by attempting to krump, albeit unsuccessfully later became an Internet meme.

A 420-HP (313 kW) Ranger SGV-770 engine was in the nose of the 28-92. The SGV-770 was an air-cooled, inverted, V-12 engine. The engine was supercharged, displaced 773 cu. in. (12.7 L), and had gear reduction for the 8-ft. 3-in. (2.51 m) diameter, two-blade, adjustable-pitch propeller. All of the trimotor's engines were hand cranked to start. The 28-92 had a fuel capacity of around 715 gallons (2,707 L). The aircraft had a span of 46-ft. 4-in. (14.1 m), a length of 28-ft. 4-in. (8.6 m), and weighed 4,700 lb. (2,132 kg) empty. The 28-92 had a top speed of 285 mph (459 km/h) and a 3,000 mile (4,828 km) range at 250 mph (402 km/h) or a 4,160 mile (6,695 km) range at 200 mph (322 km/h). Landing speed was 75 mph (121 km/h). Operational history In 1938, Bellanca re-registered the aircraft in the United States as NX2433 and entered it in the Bendix Trophy cross-country race. Frank Cordova was the pilot for the race, and the trimotor flew as race number 99. Unfortunately, because of engine trouble, the aircraft did not finish the cross-country race. The aircraft competed in the 1939 Bendix Trophy race, placing second, piloted by Arthur Bussy. After being sold in South America, the 28-92 ended its days rotting in a small field in Ecuador.

He also represented Scotland at full international level.  Biography  McCulloch, a striker, began his senior career with Third Lanark, whom he joined from junior side Shotts United in 1932. After two years at Cathkin Park, he was signed by Hearts for ¬£530, moving east at the same time as his Thirds teammate John MacKenzie. His first season at Tynecastle was notable, as he scored 38 times (at an average of a goal per game) to top the First Division scoring charts. Such a goal-scoring ratio helped Hearts to both a third-place finish and increased attendances, although Double-winners Rangers proved too strong in the Scottish Cup semi- finals.Hearts average attendance rose by over 4,000 in 1934‚Äì35 and the following season they became the most popular club in Scotland in terms of paying spectators ( Costs incurred by work to improve Tynecastle's facilities and capacity were proving a financial millstone and in November 1935, the Hearts board indicated that certain players were available for transfer. McCulloch was by this stage one of five Scotland players on the club's books, having made his debut against Wales a year earlier, and an obvious transfer target. After numerous expressions of interest from English clubs, McCulloch and international teammate Alex Massie were sold to offset the debt, McCulloch joining London side Brentford for a club record incoming fee of ¬£6,000. McCulloch continued his prodigious scoring rate with the Bees and by the end of the 1938‚Äì39 season he had scored total of 178 goals from 234 league (English and Scottish) games. He also remained a Scotland regular, earning a further 6 caps during which he scored 3 goals, including 2 against Czechoslovakia in December 1937. McCulloch was transferred to Derby County for ¬£9,500 in October 1938 but his time with his new club was disrupted by the Second World War, which began while he was at the peak of his abilities and curtailed his international career. During the conflict he \\"guested\\" for no less than six clubs, military demands ensuring footballers such as him were seldom resident in one location for an extended period of time. McCulloch's temporary sides were: Falkirk, Brentford, Aldershot, Chelsea, Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic and Swansea Town. At the war's conclusion he signed for Derby's rivals Leicester City before finishing his career with non-league Bath City and Irish side Waterford United. While with Waterford McCulloch assisted with coaching and in 1951 he returned to Scotland as manager of Alloa Athletic, a position he held for one season.

Google Maps and nearly every map creating company use this technique to increase image quality. Pansharpening produces a high-resolution color image from three, four or more low-resolution multispectral satellite bands plus a corresponding high-resolution panchromatic band: Such band combinations are commonly bundled in satellite data sets, for example Landsat 7, which includes six 30 m resolution multispectral bands, a 60 m thermal infrared band plus a 15 m resolution panchromatic band. SPOT, GeoEye and DigitalGlobe commercial data packages also commonly include both lower-resolution multispectral bands and a single panchromatic band. One of the principal reasons for configuring satellite sensors this way is to keep satellite weight, cost, bandwidth and complexity down. Pan sharpening uses spatial information in the high- resolution grayscale band and color information in the multispectral bands to create a high-resolution color image, essentially increasing the resolution of the color information in the data set to match that of the panchromatic band. One common class of algorithms for pansharpening is called ‚Äúcomponent substitution,‚Äù which usually involves the following steps: * Up-sampling: the color bands are up-sampled to the same resolution as the panchromatic band; * Alignment: the up-sampled color bands and the panchromatic band are aligned to reduce artifacts due to mis-registration (generally, when the data comes from the same sensor, this step is usually not necessary); * Forward transform: the up-sampled color bands are transformed to an alternate color space (where intensity is orthogonal to the color information); * Intensity matching: the intensity of the color bands is matched to the pan band intensity in the transformed space; * Component substitution: the pan band is then directly substituted for the transformed intensity component; * Reverse transform: the reverse transformation is performed using the substituted intensity component to transform back to the original color space. Common color-space transformation used for pan sharpening are HSI (hue-saturation-intensity), and YCbCr. The same steps can also be performed using wavelet decomposition or PCA and replacing the first component with the pan band. Pan-sharpening techniques can result in spectral distortions when pan sharpening satellite images as a result of the nature of the panchromatic band. The Landsat panchromatic band for example is not sensitive to blue light. As a result, the spectral characteristics of the raw pansharpened color image may not exactly match those of the corresponding low-resolution RGB image, resulting in altered color tones. This has resulted in the development of many algorithms that attempt to reduce this spectral distortion and to produce visually pleasing images.

She served in colonial service and in the First World War. Grafton survived the war and was broken up in the 1920s. Construction Grafton was laid down at the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company's London shipyard on 1 January 1890, and launched on 30 January 1892.Chesneau and Kolesnik 1979, p. 66. She undertook sea trials in June 1893, maintaining a speed of with her engines under natural draught, where they produced , and with engines under forced draught, when they were measured at .The Engineer 30 June 1895, p. 564. Service Commissioned at Portsmouth on 10 September 1895, she served in the China sea on the China station from 22 April 1896 until 10 September 1899. In December 1901 she was ordered to relieve as flagship on the Pacific Station. She was commissioned at Chatham by Captain John Locke Marx on 14 January 1902, with a complement of 571 officers and men. Leaving Plymouth on 31 January 1902, she stopped at Madeira, S√£o Vicente, Montevideo and Sandy Point before arriving at the garrison of the Pacific station in Valpara√≠so in mid-March. Rear-Admiral Andrew Bickford hoisted his flag as Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Station, on Grafton a couple of days later. Captain Colin Richard Keppel transferred as flag captain from Warspite to Grafton on the same day, changing places with Marx. Shortly thereafter, on 18 April 1902, Grafton landed two parties of fully armed sailors at San Jos√©, Guatemala, to suppress the revolutionary disturbance caused by the United Kingdom¬¥s efforts to obtain re- payment of a loan from the Guatemalan government. The show of force sufficed, and the government paid. On 31 January 1903 Grafton was on passage from Callao, Peru to Coquimbo, Chile, when she struck and killed a large (estimated at long) whale. On the outbreak of the First World War, Grafton was part of the 10th Cruiser Squadron, which was employed in enforcing the naval blockade of Germany.Jellicoe 1919, p. 11. In December 1914, with the Edgar class having proved unsuitable for blockade work in the North Sea, Grafton was withdrawn from active service, with her two 9.2 inch guns removed to arm the monitors and .Gardiner and Gray 1985, pp. 10‚Äì11.Gardiner and Gray 1985, pp. 47‚Äì48. It was decided to refit four ships of the Edgar class, including Grafton, for shore bombardment work for the planned operations in the Dardanelles. Two 6 inch guns replaced the 9.2 inch weapons that had been removed to arm the M15-class ships, while anti-torpedo bulges were fitted. These reduced the ship's speed by .Brown 2010, p. 163. Grafton, along with her sisters , and , served in the Gallipoli Campaign from July 1915. Grafton carried out shore bombardment during the landing at Suvla Bay and the Battle of Sari Bair in August 1915. She was struck by Turkish shells off Suvla on 12 August, killing nine of her crew. Grafton helped to cover the evacuations from Anzac Cove on 20 December 1915 and from Cape Helles in January 1916. Grafton was later awarded the battle honour \\"DARDANELLES, Feb 1915- Jan 1916\\" for her service off Gallipoli.. On 10 June 1917, Grafton was torpedoed by the German U-boat east of Malta. Graftons anti-torpedo bulges proved effective and damage was limited, allowing her to be safely brought into port at Malta under her own power with no casualties.Gibson and Prendergast, p. 260.Brown 2010, pp. 163‚Äì164. She later took part in the Battle of Jaffa. Grafton was sold for breaking up at Plymouth on 1 July 1920.Dittmar and Colledge 1972, p. 38.

The ship was built in 1916 by William Cramp & Sons, Philadelphia, as SS Joseph R. Parrott; was acquired by the U.S. Navy on 8 June 1942 from the Maritime Commission; and commissioned on 9 August 1942, Lt. Comdr. Henry G. Williams in command. Service history = Invasion of North Africa = Following training exercises, Salem departed Brooklyn, New York, on 13 November 1942, as part of a convoy, and arrived at Casablanca on 1 December. She laid 202 mines off that port on 27 and 28 December and helped fight off an air raid there on 31 December. On 20 January 1943, she sailed from Casablanca and arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 9 February. = Invasion of Italy = After repairs, she left the United States again on 13 June and arrived at Oran on 5 July. The minelayer got underway the next day as part of the Sicily invasion force; and, on 11 July, laid 390 mines off Gela, Sicily, in company with and . Returning to Oran on 17 July, Salem subsequently carried 255 British troops from Gibraltar to Oran and then moved to Bizerte in preparation for landings in Italy. However, her role in these landings was cancelled due to the Italian surrender. The ship left Mers el Kebir on 7 October and returned to New York on 26 October. = Pacific Theatre operations = Salem was repaired at Norfolk, Virginia, and carried out local operations along the Atlantic coast until 11 May 1944, when she departed Hampton Roads, Virginia, for duty with Service Squadron 6 in the Pacific. On 27 June, she sailed from Pearl Harbor with a cargo of ammunition, which she offloaded to shore facilities and combatant ships after her arrival at Eniwetok on 8 July. She then shuttled between Eniwetok, Kwajalein, Makin, Majuro, Saipan, and Tinian, helping to carry ammunition to forward areas for issue to the fleet. At Tinian on 4 October, her stern touched bottom in heavy swells, damaging both screws, and and an Army tug towed her back to Pearl Harbor. After arrival on 5 November, she underwent repairs and temporary conversion into a net cargo ship. = Conversion to net cargo ship = Salem completed conversion on 10 February 1945 and departed Pearl Harbor on 18 February with a cargo of anti- torpedo nets. After stops at Eniwetok, Ulithi, and Leyte, Salem arrived off Kerama Retto on 26 March 1945 as troops went ashore to secure the island and its harbor for use as a fleet base for the invasion of Okinawa. During the next two days, Salem laid antisubmarine nets to protect the harbor. = Frequent air attacks = Japanese air attacks were frequent; and, on 2 April, Salem's gunners helped shoot down a plane that was trying to crash into . Salem departed Kerama Retto two days later and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 27 April, where she picked up a new cargo of nets. Departing Pearl Harbor on 24 May, she unloaded her nets at Guam between 12 and 19 June, and then proceeded to Eniwetok where she repaired nets between 24 June and 31 July. = Renamed = Salem returned to Pearl Harbor on 10 August, and on 15 August, the day fighting stopped in the Pacific, was renamed as USS Shawmut to permit a new cruiser to be named . = End-of-War deactivation = Departing Pearl Harbor on 31 August, she arrived at San Francisco, California, on 10 September for inactivation. Shawmut was decommissioned on 6 December 1945, struck from the Navy List on 3 January 1946, and transferred to the Maritime Commission on 20 June 1946.

The work was commissioned in 1965 by the country's communist authorities and the lake was to be fed from the waters of four rivers. The project was reported as completed, but only the initial building phase was carried out. Three billion lei were allocated and spent on the lake, which was supposed to cover about 200 km¬≤, have a capacity of 150 million m¬≥, and be located south-west of T√¢rgu Jiu, Gorj County. Lake Ceauru still appears on maps as of 2007. History In 1965, Romania's communist authorities ordered work to begin on Lake Ceauru, conceived as a man-made lake behind a dam into which the waters of the rivers Jiu, Tismana, Bistri»õa and Jale»ô would flow. The last three rivers were diverted in order to fill the lake. Projects and studies were undertaken prior to the start of work. Following expropriation decree 1037/1965 that June, the over 2,500 inhabitants of three villages (BƒÉlƒÉce»ôti, Ceauru and »òomƒÉne»ôti) were moved by autumn, and the existing houses demolished. In 1968 the project was reported as complete to Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, and it began to appear on maps. Only the first phase was ever completed. A dike was built around the planned lake, and a weir constructed, through which the mingled waters of the four rivers were supposed to pass. Phase two involved the building of an actual dam, with a system for closing the weir. Two functions were designated for the Ceauru Dam: to absorb floodwaters when needed, to protect the mines in the region and to supply the downstream communities, as well as the Rovinari thermal power station, then under construction. The failure to complete the project was exposed when a high-ranking dignitary of the Romanian Communist Party paid a visit. All the leading members of the construction team were arrested, and the director, a certain DƒÉncescu, was sentenced to death. Eventually, Ceau»ôescu commuted his sentence to 20 years' imprisonment and sent him to work on the Danube-Black Sea Canal, where he died. Local rumour suggests that the project directors used construction materials and funds for their own gain, building a number of villas with these. Later on, a special lake was built downstream from the planned Lake Ceauru for the Rovinari power station. However, this is an imperfect solution, as during a drought, both Rovinari and Turceni (located 40 km downstream) would no longer be supplied, instead being forced to recirculate cooling water, or else halt operations. Evictions Mayor DrƒÉghici, who was nine in 1965, rebuilt his parents' house without authorisation in the same spot some four decades later, as did several other families. When interviewed, he recalled his parents' tears as their lifelong home was taken away, and the army watching to ensure that everyone left on time. The expellees, he noted, were given 9,000 lei, cement and lime, and for a while they slept on corncobs in cold, unfinished houses, wondering why they had been evicted. After effects Two 2007 interviews reflect differing opinions on the risks the unfilled site may pose. The mayor of Tele»ôti commune, Constantin DrƒÉghici, suggested that because a forest has been allowed to grow inside, tree trunks would block the weir in case of flooding, and a deluge could break open the dike. Teodor Popescu, head of the Gorj County Water Management Service, countered that the dike and weir are maintained by his company and that the lake bottom is being cultivated by the former owners (who have received proper title to the land). He admitted that a forest does exist and could be flooded, but dismissed the notion of a flood uprooting trees, predicting that any floodwaters would subside in up to six days. Lake Ceauru still appears on maps as of 2007. In fact, of three different maps of Gorj County, one shows the lake and calls it Ceauru, another shows it and calls it Rovinari, and the lake does not appear on a third. In interviews, officials lamented the situation but blamed the lake's continuing depiction on bureaucratic obstacles. Residents of the county, taught about the lake in school, all knew of its existence (as they were used to seeing it on a map), did not know where it was, and very few knew the reality of the situation.

The Inayati Order (Inayatiyya), is an international organization dedicated to spreading the Sufi teachings of Inayat Khan, a musician and mystic who first introduced Sufism to the modern Western world in 1910. The Inayati Order operates internationally through a network of centers, and offers a number of programs and activities. It is led by Zia Inayat Khan, grandson of Inayat Khan.  Objectives of the Order  The Inayati Order commits itself to the purposes identified by Inayat Khan in at the first establishment of his Sufi organization: # To realize and spread the knowledge of unity, the religion of love and wisdom, so that the bias of faiths and beliefs may of itself fall away, the human heart may overflow with love, and all hatred caused by distinctions and differences may be rooted out. # To discover the light and power latent in the human being, the secret of all religion, the power of mysticism, and the essence of philosophy, without interfering with customs or beliefs. # To help bring the world‚Äôs two opposite poles, East and West, close together by the interchange of thoughts and ideals, that the universal brotherhood-sisterhood may form of itself, and people may meet beyond the narrow national and racial boundaries.  Sufi message of Inayat Khan  According to the Inayati Order website, the Sufi Message of Inayat Khan proclaims \\"the knowledge of divine unity‚Äîof all peoples, all religions, and all existence‚Äîand the religion of the heart awakened to the beauty in all creation.\\" Core teachings are summarized in the 10 Sufi Thoughts, ‚Äúwhich comprise all the important subjects with which the inner life is concerned‚Äù: # \\"There is one God, the eternal, the only being; none else exists save God.\\" # \\"There is one master, the guiding spirit of all souls, who constantly leads followers toward the light.\\" # \\"There is one holy book, the sacred manuscript of nature, the only scripture which can enlighten the reader.\\" # \\"There is one religion, the unswerving progress in the right direction toward the ideal, which fulfills the life‚Äôs purpose of every soul.\\" # \\"There is one law, the law of reciprocity, which can be observed by a selfless conscience, together with a sense of awakened justice.\\" # \\"There is one family, the human family, which unites the children of earth indiscriminately in the parenthood of God.\\" # \\"There is one moral, the love which springs forth from self-denial and blooms in deeds of beneficence.\\" # \\"There is one object of praise, the beauty which uplifts the heart of its worshipers through all aspects from the seen to the unseen.\\" # \\"There is one truth, the true knowledge of our being, within and without, which is the essence of all wisdom.\\" # \\"There is one path, the annihilation in the Unlimited, which raises the mortal to immortality, and in which resides all perfection.\\"  Lineage  The initiatic lineage of the Inayati Order includes chains of transmission from the Chishti, Suhrawardi, Qadiri, and Naqshbandi orders, as founder Inayat Khan was initiated into these four streams. There are several living lineages and organizations that trace their origins to Inayat Khan. The Inayati Order represents the lineage passed directly to his eldest son, Vilayat Inayat Khan, includes his daughter Noor Inayat Khan, and is currently led by his grandson Zia Inayat Khan.  History  In 1910, Inayat Khan traveled from Hyderabad, India, to the United States, relocating in 1912 to London. His initial mission was as a classical Indian musician, pursuing the directive of his own Sufi teacher Abu Hashim Madani to ‚ÄúFare forth into the world, my child, and harmonize the East and the West with the harmony of your music. Spread the wisdom of Sufism abroad, for to this end art thou gifted by Allah, the most merciful and compassionate.‚Äù Pir Zia Inayat-Khan, lineage holder of the Inayati Order Inayat Khan later founded organizations to establish Sufi teaching in Western Europe, including the Sufi Order in London in 1918 and the Sufi Movement in Geneva in 1923. Inayat Khan also traveled extensively in the United States as a musician and teacher, and established a circle of students in North America. Upon Inayat Khan‚Äôs death in 1927, his brothers and cousins led the Sufi Movement. In 1968, his son Vilayat Inayat Khan revived the name ‚ÄúThe Sufi Order‚Äù in 1968 to distinguish his own lineage and circle of students. Vilayat Inayat Khan later updated this to ‚ÄúThe Sufi Order International,‚Äù and served as head of the order until 2004. During this time Inayat Khan‚Äôs teachings grew in popularity and The Sufi Order International held numerous retreats, courses, and gatherings in Europe and North America. Zia Inayat-Khan took on leadership of the Sufi Order in 2000. In 2003, Zia Inayat-Khan and senior teachers launched Suluk Academy, a course of intensive study in the teachings of Inayat Khan. In 2016, the name was changed from ‚ÄúThe Sufi Order International‚Äù to ‚ÄúThe Inayati Order,‚Äù citing the historical Sufi tradition of adopting the name of the founder in the decades following the founder‚Äôs death. As of 2019, the Inayati Order comprises over 100 centers of study around the world, with headquarters in Richmond, Virginia.

Plot =Part One: Finding Martha= The main character is 14-year-old Lauren Matthews, who lives in London with Lydia and Dave, and their son, Rory. Lauren is doing an essay for homework which is called 'Who Am I?'. It suddenly strikes Lauren that she doesn't know her true background. Eager to find out about her past, Lauren goes on a website called Missing-Children.com, and finds an American girl named Martha Lauren Purditt, who went missing less than two months before Lauren was adopted. Lauren's friend, James 'Jam' Caldwell comes around and Lauren tells him about the information she'd discovered on the website. After comparing the photograph of Martha with a photograph of herself as a toddler, and then one of herself now with an age-progressed photo, Lauren notices that she and the missing girl look alike, which led her into believing that she might be Martha Lauren Purditt. That night she hears her adoptive parents talking about her downstairs saying they will let her see \\"the diary\\" when she is 16 years old that will tell her information about her adoption. A few days later she goes into the attic discreetly, looks through the diary, where she finds that she was adopted from Marchfield Adoption Agency in Vermont, run by Taylor Tarsen; also noted down is the name \\"Sonia Holtwood\\". After persuading her family to go on a holiday to a theme park in America, they travel to America, leaving her dad behind for work issues and taking Jam in his place. While Lauren's mother and Rory are waiting to change planes, Lauren and Jam sneak off without anyone knowing and get a plane to Burlington, Vermont. Once the plane lands, Lauren and Jam get a bus to Marchfield, (where Lauren was adopted) and meet with Taylor Tarsen, the owner of the agency. He refuses to show Lauren her adoption file, but when Lauren mentions Sonia Holtwood, Taylor tells Lauren she was looked after by Sonia before she was adopted, and gives her $150 so she and Jam can stay in a motel. Jam informs Lauren that he found out where Lauren's adoption file is, and the two stay in a motel for the night. That night, Lauren and Jam break into Marchfield Adoption Agency and find Lauren's adoption file, but all that is in it is an address on a scrap of paper. Lauren and Jam then get a taxi to the address. When they arrive at what they believe to be Sonia Holtwood's flat, they discover that Sonia moved out years ago but that an young, good looking woman called Sona that still lives there. She remembers when Sonia was there, invites them Lauren and Jam into her flat as she has recognised Lauren's face as used to babysit Lauren when she lived in the flat with Sonia. Sona tells Lauren that as a toddler Lauren rarely smiled, but looked pretty when she did. On one of these occasions, Sona attempted to photograph Lauren but Sonia came bursting in, furious and left with Lauren the day after. Lauren and Jam set out to find Sonia. They run into a female police officer named Suzanna Sanders, who offers to take them on a ride in her car. Lauren accepts, but Jam is doubtful. However, after a brief discussion with Lauren, he decides to come with her. Once in the car, Suzanna gives them orange juice, which was drugged and both Lauren and Jam begin to feel sleepy, so they drift off. Hours later, they wake up and find that their phones and belongings have been taken away. Beginning to feel suspicious, they ask Suzanna where they are and demand to be let out of the car. It is from here when she reveals her true identity: Sonia Holtwood. Lauren also finds out that Sonia is a hostile woman who took Lauren away from her real family at the age of 3. Sonia then dumps them in the middle of nowhere and takes off with their phones and belongings. Luckily for the pair, a man called Glane rescues them and takes them to his log cabin. Glane then takes them to Boston, where he works. Lauren goes on the internet to find out more about Martha Lauren Purditt. She discovers that Martha's parents were Annie and Sam Purditt who live in Evanport. Seeing her determination to go there, Glane offers to take her to Evanport. =Part Two: Finding Lauren = Arriving at her destination, Lauren meets the Purditts: Annie, Sam and their two daughters (and therefore, Lauren's sisters) Shelby and Madison. When Lauren tells them that she thinks she might be Martha, Annie is the only one who believes her, while the others are sceptical. They consider taking a DNA test, to see if Lauren is really part of their family. Meanwhile, Lauren's adoptive family visit her and confess that they didn't mean to steal her from her real family; they adopted her legally, as they had no idea that she was a stolen child, but thought that she was Sonia's child and Sonia gave her up for adoption. The DNA results confirm that Lauren is indeed the daughter of Annie and Sam Purditt. Although they are her biological parents, she doesn't really fit in with them, except for Madison. She learns from her parents' lawyer that her adoptive family have been accused of abduction and are in prison. Still missing her adoptive family terribly, Lauren has a row with Annie, accusing her that Annie doesn't love her. Annie replies that she almost stopped living after Lauren went missing. After Lauren moves in with Shelby and Madison, her two sisters, she sees that Annie is a bit extreme in her emotions. Lauren likes Sam much better than Annie, but the person she likes best is her grandmother, who understands her much better than either of her parents. Lauren also realises that her sisters' personalities seem to be the opposite of each other: while Shelby is rude and has a lot of attitude as doesn't seem to get on with anyone in her family, including Lauren. Madison is a sweet and innocent girl that quickly came to view Lauren as much better sister than Shelby. When Shelby starts bullying Madison, Lauren stops her and comforts Madison. Moments afterwards, Lauren receives a text message on her phone, supposedly from Shelby, telling her to keep quiet or die. She receives another of these later. One night while Lauren is downstairs making hot chocolate, she sees someone at the door. She recognises him as Jam, and lets him in. He proposes that they run away together but Lauren hesitates and says that she needs time to think about it. She, Jam and Madison all go down to the marina so they can talk. Jam gets angry when Lauren says that she does not want to leave her real family, and storms off. Then she gets another text. She thinks it's from Shelby, but it's actually from Sonia Holtwood (who also sent Lauren the other threatening messages that she thought they were from Shelby), saying that her sister will die unless she goes to Sam's boat, the Josephine May. There, she finds Madison gagged and Sonia with a paid criminal called Frank. Later, Madison annoys Sonia by pretending to have a stomachache. She gets hit by Sonia, sending her flying across the room and causing her to crack her head on a hard shelf. Sonia and Frank then leave the boat, after Lauren lies to Frank saying that she hasn't got her cellphone. Madison and Lauren have been wedged into the room by Sonia and Frank, but then Jam appears and rescues them. The next chapter is in the hospital, where Madison has still not awoken after smacking her head. Annie and Lauren are with her when she awakes, and the two share a true mother‚Äìdaughter moment, where Lauren sees Annie for who she truly is. Back at Sam and Annie's house, Lauren meets her adoptive parents at the door; they say that they have been released from jail and have been invited there by Sam and Annie. All of them have a conversation and Lauren is asked who she wants to live with: her birth parents or her adoptive parents. She replies that she chooses both. =Epilogue = Lauren says that she now partly lives with Sam and Annie, and that she spends the school term in England with her adoptive parents. Jam is now her boyfriend and often comes with her to Sam and Annie's, and Shelby has stopped mocking her or Madison. Lauren adds that she never spends more than a few weeks away from either family, and she ends by saying that she was asked to write another 'Who Am I?' essay. She then says that it was easy because she finally knows who she is. In the essay she writes \\"girl, found\\" and writes about both families.

The family are believed to have arrived in Britain with William the Conqueror during the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century. Malcolm III of Scotland granted to them the Barony of Roslin or Rosslyn. The 11th Baron of Rosslyn also held the titles of Earl of Caithness, Lord Sinclair and Prince of Orkney. He left the Barony of Rosslyn to his eldest son from his second marriage, Oliver, and the Earldom of Caithness to his second son from his second marriage, William, from whom descend the chiefs of Clan Sinclair. The eldest son from his first marriage, also called William, became the Lord Sinclair. History No certain record exists but it is likely that the Sinclairs came from Saint-Clair-sur-Epte in Normandy. William of Saint-Claire accompanied Saint Margaret of Scotland, daughter of Edward the Exile to Scotland in 1068, where she eventually married Malcolm III of Scotland. In return for his efforts, the king supposedly granted Sinclair the barony of Roslin \\"in free heritage\\". Roslin Castle was built beginning about 1390, under Sir Henry St Clair, 9th Baron of Rosslyn, 1st Prince of Orkney.

Kelso was described as a player, difficult to get past, he caught the eye with his powerful and timely tackling, always clearing the ball well while specialising in long-range dipping shots at goal. Kelso, a defender, was born in Cardross, Dunbartonshire, and began his football career with Renton where he won the Scottish Cup in 1885 and 1888 and played in the unsuccessful 1886 final. He also won the Champions of the World title in 1888 when Scottish Cup winners Renton defeated English FA Cup winners West Bromwich Albion. He moved to Newcastle West End in 1888 and then to Everton the following year. He made his Everton and Football League debut on 19 January 1889 at Anfield, Liverpool against \\"The Invincibles\\", Preston North End. Jimmy Weir, the Everton right- half was injured and so Bob Kelso got his chance to play. In front of 15,000 fans Everton had an excellent first half and had it not been for some poor finishing and good defending by Preston Everton would've had the lead. In the second-half Everton continued to press but Preston got stronger and scored two goals and looked the better side at the end of the game. Kelso must have made a good impression on his opponents as he left Everton for Preston in May 1889. With Preston he won the English league championship in 1889-90 before moving back to Everton in 1891 where he played in the 1893 FA Cup Final. He returned to his native Scotland in 1896 with Dundee, where he earned selection for the Scottish League representative team, before ending his career with a brief spell in the Southern League at Bedminster in 1898-99. He won seven caps for Scotland, making his debut in an 8-2 win over Ireland on 14 March 1885. He captained his country in his final Scotland appearance - a 3-0 win over Ireland on 26 March 1898. His nephew, Tommy Kelso, was also a Scotland international footballer, who played for Manchester City, Dundee and Rangers. Bob's brother James Kelso played for Renton, and once appeared for Liverpool.

He surprisingly lost the 1964 election by a substantial margin, when his Republican opponent, Prentiss Walker, benefited by voters supporting Barry Goldwater in his presidential campaign in the state. Early life and education Born near Philadelphia, Mississippi, Winstead attended the public schools, Clarke Memorial College in Newton, Mississippi; and the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa. He graduated in 1931 from the University of Southern Mississippi, then known as Mississippi Southern College, at Hattiesburg. Winstead was a farmer. In his first elected office, he became the superintendent of education in his native Neshoba County, serving from 1935 to 1942. Political career Winstead was elected as a Democrat to the Seventy-eighth and to the ten succeeding Congresses (January 3, 1943 ‚Äì January 3, 1965). Like nearly all other Mississippi Democrats, he was an ardent segregationist and signed the Southern Manifesto after the United States Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that segregated schools were unconstitutional. Having won the Democratic Party primary in what was essentially a one-party state since the state constitution's effective disfranchisement of blacks in 1890, Winstead was unopposed in his first bid for Congress. With its backing at that time almost entirely African-American, the Republican Party had become comatose after disfranchisement of almost all of its base and most of its membership.Phillips, Kevin P.; The Emerging Republican Majority, pp. 208, 210 Democratic nomination subsequently became tantamount to election, thus, Winstead faced an opponent once during his ten successful campaigns. However, in 1964, Winstead was defeated by Republican challenger Prentiss Walker by a shocking 11-point margin.Our Campaigns; Arthur Winstead Winstead was swept out in large part from the district and state swinging dramatically to support Barry Goldwater's presidential bid. Goldwater carried over half of Mississippi's counties by over 90 percent of the vote. Return to private life Winstead resumed agricultural pursuits. He later became an automobile dealer. From 1968 to 1971, he was appointed as the commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Public Welfare under Governor John Bell Williams, one of his former U.S. House colleagues. Winstead died at the age of ninety- one in Philadelphia, Mississippi. He is interred there at Cedar Lawn Cemetery.

Recent advances in genome sequencing have allowed us to catalogue a large variety of organisms' genomes, but the function of the genes they contain is still largely unknown. Using STM, the function of the product of a particular gene can be inferred by disabling it and observing the effect on the organism. The original and most common use of STM is to discover which genes in a pathogen are involved in virulence in its host, to aid the development of new medical therapies/drugs. Basic premise The gene in question is inactivated by insertional mutation; a transposon is used which inserts itself into the gene sequence. When that gene is transcribed and translated into a protein, the insertion of the transposon affects the protein structure and (in theory) prevents it from functioning. In STM, mutants are created by random transposon insertion and each transposon contains a different 'tag' sequence that uniquely identifies it. If an insertional mutant bacterium exhibits a phenotype of interest, such as susceptibility to an antibiotic it was previously resistant to, its genome can be sequenced and searched (using a computer) for any of the tags used in the experiment. When a tag is located, the gene that it disrupts is also thus located (it will reside somewhere between a start and stop codon which mark the boundaries of the gene). STM can be used to discover which genes are critical to a pathogen's virulence by injecting a 'pool' of different random mutants into an animal model (e.g. a mouse infection model) and observing which of the mutants survive and proliferate in the host. Those mutant pathogens that don't survive in the host must have an inactivated gene, required for virulence. Hence, this is an example of a negative selection method.

Astronomical bodies include stars, planets, dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies such as comets and minor planets (i.e. asteroids), as well as natural satellites and minor-planet moons.  Geographic poles  The International Astronomical Union (IAU) defines the geographic north pole of a planet or any of its satellites in the Solar System as the planetary pole that is in the same celestial hemisphere, relative to the invariable plane of the Solar System, as Earth's north pole. This definition is independent of the object's direction of rotation about its axis. This implies that an object's direction of rotation, when viewed from above its north pole, may be either clockwise or counterclockwise. The direction of rotation exhibited by most objects in the solar system (including Sun and Earth) is counterclockwise. Venus rotates clockwise, and Uranus has been knocked on its side and rotates almost perpendicular to the rest of the Solar System. The ecliptic remains within 3¬∞ of the invariable plane over five million years,Laskar, Jacques (1988), \\"Secular evolution of the Solar System over 10 million years\\", Astronomy and astrophysics, no. 198, pp. 341‚Äì362 (p.351) but is now inclined about 23.44¬∞ to Earth's celestial equator used for the coordinates of poles. This large inclination means that the declination of a pole relative to Earth's celestial equator could be negative even though a planet's north pole (such as Uranus's) is north of the invariable plane. In 2009 the responsible IAU Working Group decided to define the poles of dwarf planets, minor planets, their satellites, and comets according to the right-hand rule. To avoid confusion with the \\"north\\" and \\"south\\" definitions relative to the invariable plane, the poles are called \\"positive\\" and \\"negative.\\" The positive pole is the pole toward which the thumb points when the fingers of the right hand are curled in its direction of rotation. The negative pole is the pole toward which the thumb points when the fingers of the left hand are curled in its direction of rotation. This change was needed because the poles of some asteroids and comets precess rapidly enough for their north and south poles to swap within a few decades using the invariable plane definition. The projection of a planet's geographic north pole onto the celestial sphere gives its north celestial pole. The location of the celestial poles of some selected Solar System objects is shown in the following table. The coordinates are given relative to Earth's celestial equator and the vernal equinox as they existed at J2000 (2000 January 1 12:00:00 TT) which is a plane fixed in inertial space now called the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF). Many poles precess or otherwise move relative to the ICRF, so their coordinates will change. The Moon's poles are particularly mobile. Some bodies in the Solar System, including Saturn's moon Hyperion and the asteroid 4179 Toutatis, lack a stable geographic north pole. They rotate chaotically because of their irregular shape and gravitational influences from nearby planets and moons, and as a result the instantaneous pole wanders over their surface, and may momentarily vanish altogether (when the object comes to a standstill with respect to the distant stars).  Magnetic poles  Planetary magnetic poles are defined analogously to the Earth's North and South magnetic poles: they are the locations on the planet's surface at which the planet's magnetic field lines are vertical. The direction of the field determines whether the pole is a magnetic north or south pole, exactly as on Earth. The Earth's magnetic axis is approximately aligned with its rotational axis, meaning that the geomagnetic poles are relatively close to the geographic poles. However, this is not necessarily the case for other planets; the magnetic axis of Uranus, for example, is inclined by as much as 60¬∞. Orbital pole In addition to the rotational pole, a planet's orbit also has a defined direction in space. The direction of the angular momentum vector of that orbit can be defined as an orbital pole. Earth's orbital pole, i.e. the ecliptic pole, points in the direction of the constellation Draco.  Near, far, leading and trailing poles  In the particular (but frequent) case of synchronous satellites, four more poles can be defined. They are the near, far, leading, and trailing poles. For example, Io, one of the moons of Jupiter, rotates synchronously, so its orientation with respect to Jupiter stays constant. There will be a single, unmoving point of its surface where Jupiter is at the zenith, exactly overhead ‚Äì this is the near pole, also called the sub- or pro-Jovian point. At the antipode of this point is the far pole, where Jupiter lies at the nadir; it is also called the anti-Jovian point. There will also be a single unmoving point which is farthest along Io's orbit (best defined as the point most removed from the plane formed by the north-south and near-far axes, on the leading side) ‚Äì this is the leading pole. At its antipode lies the trailing pole. Io can thus be divided into north and south hemispheres, into pro- and anti-Jovian hemispheres, and into leading and trailing hemispheres. These poles are mean poles because the points are not, strictly speaking, unmoving: there is continuous libration about the mean orientation, because Io's orbit is slightly eccentric and the gravity of the other moons disturbs it regularly. These poles also apply to planets that are rotating synchronously with their primary stars, as is likely the case with many hot Jupiters and as was once thought to be the case with Mercury. Other synchronously rotating objects, such as Pluto and some asteroids with large asteroid moons, can also be described as having \\"near\\" and \\"far\\" poles ‚Äì though \\"leading\\" and \\"trailing\\" may not be as significant in these cases.

He served one term as a U.S. Representative from Mississippi. Biography Niles was born in Burlington, Vermont on December 19, 1814, the son of Daniel Swift Niles and Alice Reed, both natives of New Hampshire. He attended the local schools of Burlington, received a bachelor's degree from the University of Vermont in 1836, and a master's degree in 1846. He taught school in Quebec, Ohio, and Tennessee, and later moved to Mississippi. While teaching school, Niles studied law; he was admitted to the bar in 1851 and began a practice in Kosciusko. He served as an anti-secession delegate to Mississippi's 1851 constitutional convention. Civil War During the American Civil War, Niles was a supporter of the Union; he remained in Mississippi, and worked to keep a low public profile. Though he was a diarist and kept a journal for nearly 30 years beginning in 1831, Niles made no entries for the first two years of the war, presumably to avoid having local Confederates use his writings to prove disloyalty. Niles did not want to serve in the Confederate military, and arranged to have the son of a friend serve in Mississippi's state troops as a substitute. He later ran for mayor, presuming that if he won, his status as an elected official would be exempt from military service. He was elected in May 1864, and served one term. Post-Civil War Niles continued his pro-Union politics after the war; he was a delegate to Mississippi's constitutional conventions in 1865 and 1868. He also served in the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1870. In 1871 he was appointed judge of Mississippi's 13th district, and he served until 1872. In 1872, Niles was elected as a Republican to the 43rd Congress. He served one term, March 4, 1873 to March 3, 1875. With the end of Reconstruction in Mississippi, the Democratic Party returned to power, and Niles was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1874. From 1876 to 1880, Niles was editor of the Kosciusko Chronicle newspaper. He then returned to the practice of law. Death and burial Niles died in Kosciusko, Mississippi, July 7, 1894 and was interred at Kosciusko's City Cemetery. Family In 1847, Niles married Harriet N.
