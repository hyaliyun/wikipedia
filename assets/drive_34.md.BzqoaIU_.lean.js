Early life Roger Averill was born in Salisbury, Connecticut. Some of his ancestors were among the earliest European settlers of Connecticut. His grandfathers, Samuel Averill and John Whittlesey, were natives of Washington, Connecticut. His parents, Nathaniel P. Averill and Mary Whittlesey, moved to Salisbury in 1805. He was one of seven children reared on a small farm, and his education was mainly of his own earning. He went to the common school and used a public library and prepared for college under the guidance of his brother Chester, who was a professor at Union College, and he graduated from that college with honour in 1832. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1837. He opened his first practice in Salisbury, but attained a more successful practice after moving to Danbury in 1849. He married Maria D. White, of Danbury, in October, 1844. Four of their children survived him and all of his sons also became lawyers. Political career Roger Averill fulfilled many functions in public service, such as member of the Connecticut General Assembly. In the spring of 1861, he was a prominent leader of the Democratic party, which opposed the election of Abraham Lincoln for President. However, the instance that he heard the news of the assault of Fort Sumter, he hastened to raise his flag and refuse any compromise or surrender. From then on, he devoted himself to the success of the Union army. He was elected Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut along with Republicans on a Unionist ticket (called the \\"Union Party of Connecticut\\") in the spring of 1862 \\"The Connecticut Mass Union Convention\\", The New York Times (January 9, 1862), and continued in that function throughout the war, during the last four of the eight years in which William A. Buckingham was Governor of the state, until 1866. In both 1862 and 1863, the Republicans and Unionists had two separate conventions each year within days of each other, both of which would endorse the fusion Unionist tickets; in 1864 and 1865, they both merged into the National Union Party, which simply had one convention each year. Later years Averill's wife Maria died in February 1860. In September 1861, he married Mary A. Perry, of Southport, who survived him. After the time as lieutenant governor, Averill was one of the organizers of the American Bar Association, Simeon E. Baldwin, \\"The Founding of the American Bar Association\\", The American Bar Association Journal (January 1, 1917), p. 670. and was for many years acting chairman of the bar of his home county.

It was written from the perspective of a drug addict, who begins to receive bizarre text messages on his cellphone. The song was developed very early during the No Line on the Horizon sessions, and was recorded in a single take. Writing and recording The No Line on the Horizon sessions began with two weeks of recording in Fez, Morocco. Recording took place in a rented courtyard of a hotel riad, which the band turned into a makeshift recording studio. \\"Unknown Caller\\" was recorded in a single take in this time, along with the songs \\"No Line on the Horizon\\", \\"Moment of Surrender\\", and \\"White as Snow\\". A few iterations of the track had previously been developed, but the \\"definitive version was only ever played once.\\" Guitarist The Edge noted that they \\"were songs that pretty much came together in the space of a couple of hours, and therefore probably were played in the final incarnation maybe once or twice.\\" Co-writer and producer Daniel Lanois noted that the song \\"pretty much had its personality intact from day one.\\" The open-air Riad allowed the band to hear the overhead birdsong during their sessions; this was taped and included in the introduction of the song. Towards the end of the recording sessions, producer Steve Lillywhite made a few minor changes to the song to make it \\"brilliant\\", including changes to the song's drumming and bassline. In an interview with The Guardian, lead singer Bono stated that he became tired of writing in the first-person, noting that \\"I'd just worn myself out as a subject matter\\"; as a result he created several characters, including a traffic cop, a drug addict, and a soldier serving in Afghanistan. The drug addict character appears in \\"Unknown Caller\\", as well as in \\"Moment of Surrender\\", when the character is having a crisis of faith and is suicidal. In an altered state, the character attempts to use his phone to buy drugs, when he begins receiving cryptic text messages with technology- inspired directions. The themes in the song include social alienation and personal identity, as well as optimism. Mojo noted that the drug addict was \\"not unusual in this record in being lost, spiritually broken.\\" The lyrics \\"3:33, when the numbers fell off the clock face\\" are a reference to Jeremiah , the same Bible verse referenced on the cover of U2's 2000 album, All That You Can't Leave Behind. Composition \\"Unknown Caller\\" is composed in the key of G major. Note: Need to have \\"musicnotes\\" software installed. The song begins with a droning noise, the birdsong of Moroccan swallows, and exotic instruments, before The Edge begins playing a four note riff, similar to that of \\"Walk On\\". The chorus features a monotone group chant of commands (\\"Go / Shout it out / Rise up / Hear me, cease to speak / That I may speak / Shush now\\"), alternating with drawn out \\"Ohh / Ohh\\" lines. After the second chorus, a French horn part, played by Richard Watkins, as well as a church organ are heard. The song concludes with a guitar solo that was taken directly from the song's backing track. Live performances \\"Unknown Caller\\" made its live debut on the opening night of the U2 360¬∞ Tour with Larry Mullen Jr and The Edge both providing backing vocals. It was played at 22 of 24 concerts during the first leg of the tour, where it typically followed one of \\"In a Little While\\", \\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\\", and \\"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\\", and preceded \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\". It was also performed at the beginning of the second leg of the tour, usually following \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" or \\"Your Blue Room\\", but was dropped from the set list for several weeks. It was played again towards the end of the second leg. In the break between songs, the birdsong recorded in the introduction was played through the stage's speakers. The video screen showed footage of the band members with the song's lyrics positioned overtop scrolling from right to left. The words are colored red with the exception of the word that is currently being sung, which is highlighted in green. Reception and legacy \\"Unknown Caller\\" received mixed reviews from critics. Rolling Stone described The Edge's guitar solo as \\"a straightforward, elegiac break with a worn, notched edge to his treble tone\\", while likening Bono's chorus chant of \\"Shout for joy if you get the chance\\" to the band's 1979 song \\"Out of Control\\", noting that \\"[Bono] is still singing about singing.\\" Reviewer Brian Hiatt noted that the song would have worked well on All That You Can't Leave Behind. Q described the song's placement in the opening half of the album as \\"the U2 of wide-open spaces, of sweeping mountain valleys, and of Edge's signature chiming guitar lines.\\" Mojo felt that bassist Adam Clayton's playing was largely responsible for the song's \\"evocation of both frigidity and tenderness\\", noting the transition from the French horn to The Edge's guitar solo was \\"as exalted as any U2 music gets.\\" Blender felt that Bono \\"reache[d] Bowie-in-Berlin levels of arty alienation,\\" and labelled the guitar playing in the song the best from the album, while the New York Times believed it would be a \\"likely arena singalong\\" live. Uncut likened the song to the band's 1984 single \\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\", describing it as \\"the most dramatic bait-and-switch on a record riddled with them ‚Äì a gentle Edge guitar figure and birdsong an unlikely foundation for the gradual erection of a terrifically unabashed stadium epic.\\" Musician Gavin Friday described the song as \\"a new age 'Bad, and Hot Press editor Niall Stokes called the song \\"another U2 classic\\". Allmusic was not a fan of the song, stating \\"when U2, Eno, and Lanois push too hard ‚Äì the ill-begotten techno-speak overload of \\"Unknown Caller\\"... ‚Äì the ideas collapse like a pyramid of cards... turning it into a murky muddle.\\" NME believed that the lyrics were No Line on the Horizon's greatest weakpoint, citing \\"Unknown Caller\\"'s chorus of \\"Force quit and move to trash\\" and \\"Restart and reboot yourself\\" as being inspired by Bono's computer. Pitchfork stated that the song was \\"a wash of shameless U2-isms,\\" noting that some of the guitar parts were very similar to those of \\"Walk On\\". \\"Unknown Caller\\" is the opening track in the Anton Corbijn film Linear, based on a story by Corbijn and Bono where a Parisian traffic cop travels across France and the Mediterranean Sea to visit his girlfriend in Tripoli. The opening sequence shows a scene of Paris at dusk, before moving on to a journey through the city streets. It ends at the traffic cop's home, where the next track, \\"Breathe\\", begins. \\"Unknown Caller\\" has been used in ESPN television commercials advertising the 2010 FIFA World Cup, along with several other U2 songs.

Hyde (June 1, 1812 ‚Äì June 18, 1896) was an American politician who was the 53rd Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut from 1867 to 1869. He previously served as President pro tempore of the Connecticut Senate. A noted agricultural scientist, breeder of pureblood Devon cattle, school and prison reformer. Born, lived and died at Stafford, Connecticut. Education Attendance at the district school in his native town, and about six weeks of study at the academy in Monson, Mass., comprised his entire school education. His boyhood was passed in the manner common to the boys of that time; work on the farm, accompanied by general service in an old-time hotel connected with the farm and known as the half-way stage station between Worcester and Hartford, and about four months as a stage driver between Stafford and Sturbridge, filled up the years between school and the commencement of his active business life. Early business life He was interested in a blast furnace business for about eight years; in his twenty-ninth year he was the chief promoter of a cotton mill at Stafford Springs; he was for many years interested in the business of manufacturing satinets, as one of the firm of Converse & Hyde; and he was engaged in many other industrial enterprises. Stock breeding His energies were devoted principally to breeding blooded stock. About the year 1842, having become the owner of two or three large farms, he commenced the careful breeding of stock from imported and native cattle, and thus entered upon a course that was to make his name familiar as a household word to the leading agriculturists throughout the country. He began with Devons, and afterwards experimented with Ayrshires, Durhams, and Jerseys; but believing the Devons to be the best adapted to this part of the country, he applied himself to the scientific selection and breeding of that class, and as a result he greatly improved the stock and produced herds of rare beauty and excellence, the winners of many a sweepstake medal and prize. Animals from his herds went out to all parts of the country, and the improvement of the stock in his native state was credited in a large measure to his care and wisdom as a breeder of pure-blooded Devons. Agricultural societies Largely due to his influence and enterprise the Tolland County Agricultural Society was organized in 1852. Ephrain Hyde was its president from its organization to 1860, and again from 1864 to 1868. He was president of the Connecticut State Agricultural Society from 1858 to 1881, vice president of the New England Agricultural Society from its beginning in 1864, vice president of the State Board of Agriculture from its organization in 1866 to 1882; and was chosen again in 1890; chairman of the commissioners on diseases of domestic animals for over thirty years; president of the American Breeders' Association from 1865 until it resolved itself into sections for each breed; president of the Connecticut Valley Agricultural Association, comprising Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont; incorporator of the Connecticut Stock Breeders' Association; vice president of the Dairyman's Association; chairman of the committee to publish the first volume of the American Herd Book; president of the Tolland County East Agricultural Society from its organization in 1870 to 1876; and one of the trustees and vice president of the Storrs School. Storrs School (now the University of Connecticut) Hyde long favored a school in which the science of agriculture would be taught, and he was one of the first two persons who consulted the Storrs brothers in regard to the project of establishing such a school. Their scheme met his approval; and that the plan was finally adopted, and that the school was able to maintain itself against the numerous attacks that have been made upon it by friends and foes alike, was largely owing to his indefatigable efforts and earnest support. At a meeting of the trustees in 1889 he was chosen one of the building committee to erect the beautiful and commodious structures which have been completed at about the estimated cost of $50,000. Prisoner's Friend Association Hyde's labors to secure reform in the management of prisons and houses of correction were extensive and persistent. In 1845, he was one of the founders and directors of the Prisoner's Friend Association; later he was a director, also, of the Industrial School for Girls; and has been more or less active in the direction of the state board of education, especially in 1867, 1868, and 1869. Political offices Hyde was county commissioner for Tolland County 1842‚Äì1843; member of the house of representatives from Stafford 1851-1852; and delegate to the Democratic National Convention at Baltimore in 1860. He was a state senator and president pro tem of the Connecticut state senate in 1876-1877, and Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut 1867-1869. Family Ephraim Hyde married, first, Hannah Converse Young, September 27, 1836. Six children were born to them, three of whom died in infancy, another at the age of four years; the other two were Ellen E., wife of Ernest Cady, of the Pratt & Cady Company of Hartford, and E. H. Hyde, Jr., of the firm of Hyde & Joslyn, Hartford. His first wife died February 26, 1862, and, on October 19, 1869, he married Miss Mary S. Williams of Hartford, who survived him. Religion Hyde took an efficient and active interest in the Universalist Society of Stafford, serving therein as sexton, organist, and leader of the choir for fifteen years.

The hotel has changed hands a number of times over the years, but it has remained in continuous use since it was constructed. Today, the Balch Hotel is an active hotel serving visitors to the Dufur area. Because of its importance to local history, the Balch Hotel is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The first homesteader arrived in the Dufur area in 1852. The earliest community records are of church meetings beginning in 1862. The town was named for the Dufur family, successful ranchers who settled in the Dufur Valley in 1872. The Dufur post office was established in 1878. The town of Dufur was incorporated 1893.McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L. McArthur, Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003.\\"History\\", Dufur Oregon, Thunderbolt Designs, The Dalles, Oregon, 14 August 2004. The need to accommodate travelers grew along with the town of Dufur. The Balch Hotel was designed by F. M. Andrews for Charles P. Balch, a local rancher and pharmacist. It was built in 1907, and opened on 17 January 1908. When the hotel opened, the cost of a room ranged from $0.50 to $1.25 per night. The hotel boasted that it had hot water in every room, electric lights, and steam heat. At that time, there were only two places in the Dufur Valley that had electricity, the Balch Hotel and Dufur's saw mill. The two businesses shared the limited power supply; each got twelve hours of electricity per day. The lumber mill had electricity for 12 hours during the day, and the hotel was connected for twelve hours beginning in the evening. In its early years, the Great Southern Railroad would drop off salesmen, who could connect at Dufur between the railroad's northern terminus at The Dalles and coaches to points south in Central Oregon. The salesmen typically stayed at the Balch Hotel, and would set up their wares in the hotel's parlor. This made the hotel a center of community activity as well as a haven for travelers.\\"History\\" , Historic Balch Hotel, www.balchhotel.com, Dufur, Oregon, 28 November 2008.\\"Historic Balch Hotel\\", Northwest Renovation, Twenty First Avenue Publishing, Portland, Oregon, December/January 2007/2008.. In 1914, Balch sold the hotel to Frank and Ethel Ingels. The onset of the Great Depression, which was attended by the closure of the railroad and the failure of a major local apple orchard, marked the end of Dufur's and the hotel's heyday. The Ingels family operated the hotel until the 1940s. When they sold the building, it was converted into apartments. It was a rooming house for a number of years and later a private residence. The building was eventually purchased by Howard and Patricia Green in 1988. The Greens restored and modernized the building and reopened the hotel. In 2006, Jeff and Samantha Irwin purchased the hotel from the Greens. The Irwins continued the Greens' restoration work. Then in June 2015, Claire Sierra and Josiah Dean took over operations. Today, the Balch Hotel is a small but well-appointed tourist hotel. Because the Balch Hotel played an important role in the commercial development of Dufur and central Wasco County, the hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 8 September 1987. The historic site covers ten acres, with one historic building (the hotel) and three other non-contributing structures on the property.\\"Balch Hotel\\", National Register of Historic Places, www.nationalregisterofhistoricalplaces.com, 18 February 2008.\\"Balch Hotel\\", Historical Places Database, www.hpdb.org, Oakland, California, 22 February 2009. Structure The Balch Hotel is a three-story Italianate style brick building. The bricks used in the hotel's construction were made at a brickworks on Charles Balch's ranch, near the building site. The hotel's brick walls are 18 inches thick. This keeps the hotel's interior cool during the hot summer months. All the rooms were restored and modernized between 1988 and 2007, so the Balch Hotel is quite modern; however, it still retains an early 20th-century feel. There are no telephones or televisions in the rooms, but there are wireless Internet connections. The building's historic character has been maintained in many small details; for example, original fire hoses hang in the hallway and an old electric meter is still in its original location on the second floor. The hotel has 19 guest bedrooms plus a suite on the third floor with a view of Mount Hood and private whirlpool tub. Each room has an individual style with antique furnishings and unique period d√©cor. All the rooms on the south side of the building have private baths. The rooms on the north side share common bath facilities with original claw-foot tubs.\\"Welcome\\" , Historic Balch Hotel, www.balchhotel.com, Dufur, Oregon, 28 November 2008.Hennen, Leah, \\"A Retreat in Rural Oregon\\", VIA Magazine, San Francisco, California, January 2008.

It is the seventh track on their 2009 album No Line on the Horizon. The track was first developed during the recording sessions in Fez, Morocco, but the band struggled to complete the song and it was recreated numerous times over the following 16 months. It underwent several title changes during this time, being referred to first as \\"For Your Love\\", then \\"Stand Up\\", and finally \\"Stand Up Comedy\\". The song's lyrics were inspired by the 2008 Stand Up and Take Action campaign, and several lines reflect singer Bono's sense of hubris. Reception towards the song was mixed, though numerous reviews likened the track's guitar riffs to Led Zeppelin. Writing and recording \\"Stand Up Comedy\\" went through several different iterations throughout the No Line on the Horizon sessions. It was originally developed during the first two weeks of recording in Fez, Morocco. The song is composed in the key of F minor. Note: Need to have \\"musicnotes\\" software installed. In its original concept, the track contained mandolins playing in a Middle Eastern beat. The riff was altered and the lyric \\"for your love\\" was introduced as a chant in the chorus. However the band felt that the new guitar part was too similar to that of The Kinks song \\"You Really Got Me\\", and the lyrics too reminiscent of The Yardbirds song of the same name, so this version was discarded. U2 redeveloped the song with a new riff, melody, and lyrics, with only the \\"for your love\\" vocal remaining. Guitarist the Edge's collaboration with Jimmy Page and Jack White on the 2009 film It Might Get Loud resulted in their influence being felt in the new guitar part. The Edge felt the guitar riffs were one of his best. The band continued struggling to finalize the song during the final recording sessions in December 2008, 16 months after it was first developed in Fez. The lyrics were rewritten again during this time. At this point the song had been renamed several times, with various album pre-release interviews calling it \\"For Your Love\\" and \\"Stand Up\\". Producer and co-writer Daniel Lanois noted the track had been recreated so many times that six different songs had been written as a result. He likened \\"Stand Up Comedy\\"'s creation to the popular YouTube video Evolution of Dance, noting that it had been rewritten so many times that it was \\"a study in itself\\". Producer and co-writer Brian Eno felt that the band had taken the song and \\"work[ed] it into the ground, then work[ed] it back to life again,\\" noting that it was a \\"frustrating\\" process. U2 believed that the completed result at the end of the recording sessions was \\"a great song\\", but they also felt that the end result would seem too \\"crafted\\" to listeners. An older mix was ultimately chosen for inclusion on the album instead. The lyrics of \\"Stand Up Comedy\\" were inspired by the Stand Up and Take Action campaign, an event in 2008 where 116 million people from 131 countries reminded the leaders of countries of their promise to reduce poverty by 2015. Bono noted that the theme is \\"not a 'let's hold hands and the world is a better place sort of song.' It's more kick down the door of your own hypocrisy.\\" Several of the song's lyrics stem from Bono mocking his sense of hubris and his fear that his activism and campaigning will go too far, making him unable to measure up to his ideals. Josh Tyrangiel of Time noted that the song was \\"explicitly told through Bono's rose-colored specs\\". The lyrics \\"Stand up to rock stars\\" and \\"Beware of small men with big ideas\\" reflect this inner doubt; Bono believed that the latter line was the funniest on the album. Appearances in other media \\"Stand Up Comedy\\" is the eighth track in the Anton Corbijn film Linear, based on a story by Corbijn and Bono where a Parisian traffic cop travels across France and the Mediterranean Sea to visit his girlfriend in Tripoli. During the sequence the cop, played by Sa√Ød Taghmaoui, resumes his journey through the mountains after his lunch. It ends with his deciding to make a stop in C√°diz where the next track, \\"Get on Your Boots\\", begins. Reception Critical reception towards \\"Stand Up Comedy\\" was mixed. BBC Music's Chris Jones felt the track was a classic U2 song, calling it \\"a rowdy, grand gesture urging you to 'stand up for love' as only U2 can.\\" He cited the lyric \\"stop helping God across the road like a little old lady\\" as one of the best lines that Bono had ever written. Q described bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen Jr.'s playing as \\"bring[ing] forth U2's hitherto unrevealed funky side,\\" also noting that the track was \\"propelled by some coruscating Edge guitar work\\", which was described as reminiscent of Led Zeppelin. Rolling Stone felt that the lyrics had \\"an almost hip-hop-like cadence,\\" while calling The Edge's guitar riff a cross between The Beatles' \\"Come Together\\" and Led Zeppelin's \\"Heartbreaker\\". Uncut felt that some of Bono's vocals echoed the band's 1984 single \\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\" in their delivery. Allmusic was disappointed by the song, describing it as \\"hamfisted white-boy funk\\" and suggesting that the absence of co-writers Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno was the reason it seemed \\"stilted.\\" NME called the song \\"astonishingly uninteresting\\" and a \\"bog-standard rock song,\\" likening it to an outtake from the How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb sessions. Spin believed the song was a clumsy attempt to \\"adopt a self-conscious Zoo TV swagger\\", noting that the result \\"exposes Bono's dodgier wordplay.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Lyrics at U2.com Category:2009 songs Category:Song recordings produced by Brian Eno Category:Song recordings produced by Daniel Lanois Category:Songs written by Adam Clayton Category:Songs written by Bono Category:Songs written by the Edge Category:Songs written by Larry Mullen Jr. Category:U2 songs it:No Line on the Horizon#Stand Up Comedy ","title":"Stand Up Comedy (song)"},{"id":"21741465","text":"George G.

Eno had referred to the demo version as one of his favorite U2 songs of all time. After rewriting the song, U2 asked Steve Lillywhite to mix it. Eno estimated that the song was remixed 80 times during the album sessions. Two sets of lyrics were worked on during the song's many various incarnations. The first version was about Nelson Mandela, and the second was \\"more surreal and personal\\". The band eventually decided on using the latter for the song. \\"Breathe\\" was one of five songs, along with \\"Magnificent\\", \\"Get on Your Boots\\", \\"I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight\\", and \\"Unknown Caller\\" recorded by a fan outside of Bono's house during the No Line on the Horizon sessions. The clips were subsequently uploaded to YouTube, but removed at the request of Universal Music. The song takes place on 16 June, an intentional reference to Bloomsday, the date on which the James Joyce novel Ulysses is set. When writing the lyrics, Bono wanted the song to \\"become more intimate... I want to get away from subject and subject matter into pure exchange. Not even conversation. Often, it's just like grunts or outbursts.\\" He noted that on \\"Breathe\\" the listener is \\"right there in the middle of this outburst.\\" During the No Line on the Horizon sessions, he developed several characters to tell the songs' stories for him. The narrator within \\"Breathe\\" is one of the few of these characters who ultimately finds redemption. Composition \\"Breathe\\" begins with a faded-in, mixed down drum solo by drummer Larry Mullen Jr. and a cello part by Caroline Dale, before the other instrumental parts join in. The song is written in a 12/8 time signature, and played at a tempo of 78 beats per minute. Appearances in other media \\"Breathe\\" appears as the second track in the Anton Corbijn film Linear, based on a story by Corbijn and Bono in which a Parisian traffic cop travels across France and the Mediterranean Sea to visit his girlfriend in Tripoli. During the sequence, the cop, played by Sa√Ød Taghmaoui, knocks over his police-issued motorcycle, sets it on fire, and watches it burn. It ends with the officer getting on his own motorcycle and setting off on his journey, where the next track, \\"Winter\\", begins. Live performances \\"Breathe\\" was first performed live on the No Line on the Horizon promotional tour during an appearance on the French television program Le Grand Journal. It was played at several other promotional events leading up to the album's release, including a Live Lounge session for BBC Radio 1, on CBS-TV's Late Show with David Letterman, and a short set at Fordham University. The song was debuted on tour in Barcelona as the opening song at the first concert on the U2 360¬∞ Tour, on 30 June 2009. \\"Breathe\\" was also performed as the opening song at 43 of the 44 concerts on the first two legs of U2 360¬∞ Tour. The song's performance in Pasadena, California was omitted from the concert's video release, U2 360¬∞ at the Rose Bowl, but was included on some editions as a bonus track. The Edge described the song as a \\"fuck-off live rocker\\". Reception \\"Breathe\\" received mainly positive reviews from music critics. Brian Eno said that the song was one of the best the band had ever written. Rolling Stone speculated that the closing lyrics reflected Bono's feelings in being a member of U2, calling the track \\"hard-rock clatter.\\" Allmusic had a favourable impression of the song, stating \\"U2 strike that unmistakable blend of soaring, widescreen sonics and unflinching openhearted emotion that's been their trademark, turning the intimate into something hauntingly universal.\\" Q said the track's position alongside \\"White as Snow\\" and \\"Cedars of Lebanon\\" at the end of the album gave No Line on the Horizon \\"its twist in the tail\\", describing the song as \\"all jungle rumble drums and crashing guitars.\\" Entertainment Weekly enjoyed the song, calling it an \\"instant classic\\" while describing it as a \\"stomping, snarling rumination about engaging the world with open arms despite so much external gloom and internal angst.\\" NME labelled the lyrics \\"twaddle\\", but called it the band's best song since \\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\\". Pitchfork had a negative impression of the song, stating that some of the lyrics sound \\"like a cop-out from a man who spent so much time struggling with salvation.\\" Personnel U2 *Bono ‚Äì vocals, guitar *The Edge ‚Äì guitar, backing vocals, piano *Adam Clayton ‚Äì bass guitar *Larry Mullen Jr. ‚Äì drums, percussion Additional performers *Brian Eno ‚Äì rhythm loops, programming, synthesizers, vocals *Danny Lanois ‚Äì guitar, vocals *Caroline Dale ‚Äì cello *Terry Lawless ‚Äì additional keyboards Technical *Production ‚Äì Steve Lillywhite *Additional production ‚Äì Danny Lanois, Brian Eno *Engineering ‚Äì Declan Gaffney *Engineering assistance ‚Äì Tom Hough *Additional engineering ‚Äì CJ Eiriksson *Mixing ‚Äì CJ Eiriksson, Steve Lillywhite *Mixing assistance ‚Äì Dave Emery See also *List of covers of U2 songs - Breathe ReferencesExternal links *Lyrics at U2.com * Category:2009 songs Category:Bloomsday Category:Song recordings produced by Steve Lillywhite Category:Songs written by Adam Clayton Category:Songs written by Bono Category:Songs written by the Edge Category:Songs written by Larry Mullen Jr. Category:U2 songs ","title":"Breathe (U2 song)"},{"id":"21741488","text":"Dennis Albert Blakeslee (March 11, 1856 ‚Äì April 5, 1933) was an American politician who was the 74th Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut from 1911 to 1913.

While serving as mayor, he was charged with conspiracy, corruption and defrauding the town of Waterbury of more than one million dollars. Hayes was convicted and served 6 years in Wethersfield State Prison. Early life and political background Hayes was born in Waterbury, Connecticut to wealthy Irish parents, who owned a liquor store business and real estate in Waterbury. Hayes graduated from Georgetown University. After his father's death in 1913, Hayes assumed control of the family businesses, which included real estate, a brewery and the Jacques Theater. He was also a bank director of a local bank, and president of Lux Clock Company. Between 1927 and 1930, he was a state legislator and was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1932 and 1936. In 1934 he was elected lieutenant-governor under Wilbur Lucius Cross. Mayor of Waterbury Hayes was elected mayor in 1929, his position as mayor was in addition to his position as lieutenant-governor, which he held at the same time. Upon taking office in 1930, Hayes changed the city charter, effectively giving him power to make all employment decisions and created a no-bid city contracts system. At least $600,000 in city funds were paid for contracting work that was never done, and fees of $175,000 were split between Hayes, his associates in the mayor's office, and vendors and contractors. Another scam included distributing $100,000 to city officials, from money saved on the city's electric bills. There were additional allegations of corruption involving invoices for services that never happened; cleaning and refacement of a brass statute, cleaning and polishing the marble in the city hall building, and payments for police vehicles that were never ordered or delivered. In the 1937 election, Hayes won by a margin of only 55 votes over his Republican opponent. Daniel Leary, the incumbent city comptroller, who was involved in the corruption, was defeated by Sherwood Rowland who took over as comptroller. Rowland uncovered the illegal activity involving millions of dollars funneled to Hayes and his associates and leaked his findings to the local newspaper, Waterbury Republican and American. Based on the newspaper stories, the following year a grand jury indicted Hayes, four other city officials and 23 others. They were accused of various kickback schemes, massive fraud, conspiracy and corruption. Hayes was convicted of accepting one million dollars of illegal funds and sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison. Hayes reported to prison on March 6, 1941 and served six years in Wethersfield State Prison. Personal life Hayes never married, and lived with his mother until she died. After being released on parole, he returned to Waterbury where he remained until his death in 1965 of a fatal heart attack.

The track is based on the hymn \\"Veni, veni Emmanuel\\", and is the only political song on the album. Inspiration U2 were asked by Jim Sheridan to write a song for his 2009 film Brothers. Bono noted that Sheridan wanted a \\"complex song for a complex character\\" and so the band wrote two songs: \\"Winter\\" and \\"White as Snow\\". While \\"Winter\\" is a \\"more universal song about the experience of the armed forces in Afghanistan\\", \\"White as Snow\\" focuses more on the relationship between the Cahill brothers. The band preferred \\"Winter\\" for the film, but as they also wanted to include the track on No Line on the Horizon they struggled to complete it in time for the film's planned release date. \\"White as Snow\\" was selected to be used in its place, though the push back of the film's release date meant that the band could finish \\"Winter\\" and it was ultimately used instead. Writing, recording, and composition In an interview with The Guardian, lead singer Bono revealed that he became tired of writing in the first-person, noting that \\"I'd just worn myself out as a subject matter\\"; as a result he created several characters, including a traffic cop, a drug addict, and a soldier serving in Afghanistan. The soldier's character appears in \\"White as Snow\\", which focuses on the soldier's last thoughts as he dies from the wounds caused by an improvised explosive device. Bono came up with the idea after reading Pincher Martin, written by William Golding. The melody of \\"White as Snow\\" is based on that of the traditional Advent hymn \\"Veni, veni Emmanuel\\". Stemming from a conversation on hymns with Bono, producer Daniel Lanois began to study the subject with Newfoundland musician Lori Anna Reid and asked her for some suggestions of hymns U2 could play. Reid came up with several suggestions, one of which was \\"Veni, veni Emmanuel\\"; Lanois recorded a piano rendition of the hymn for the band and laid down a vocal arrangement, noting \\"Bono had this \\"white as snow\\" idea. It just slowly came together.\\" Lanois later stated that it was \\"no accident Reid's suggestion made the album.\\" The song was recorded in one take during two weeks of recording sessions in Fez, Morocco in 2007, though it received some minor editing in the final sessions in December 2008. At this time, it was taken out of the 'Maybe' pile to balance out the rockier tunes present earlier on, with bassist Adam Clayton noting that \\"it gave the listener a break.\\" Bono noted that, with the exception of \\"White as Snow\\", the band had tried to keep the theme of war out of the album. \\"White as Snow\\" runs for 4:41 (4 minutes, 41 seconds). According to Hal Leonard Corporation's sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, it is played in common time at a tempo of 88 beats per minute in the key of G major. Alternate sheet music by the same publisher states it is played at a tempo of 87 beats per minute in a key of E minor. The original plan was for the track to start with an explosion, though this was later scrapped. Richard Watkins played the French horn in the song.Liner notes to No Line on the Horizon. Personnel ; U2 * Bono - lead vocals, guitar * The Edge - guitar, backing vocals, piano * Adam Clayton - bass guitar * Larry Mullen Jr. - drums, percussion ; Additional musicians * Brian Eno - keyboards * Richard Watkins - french horn Reception Rolling Stone described it as \\"mostly alpine quiet ‚Äì guitar, keyboard, Bono and harmonies, like The Doors' \\"The Crystal Ship\\" crossed with an Appalachian ballad.\\" Uncut labelled it as \\"the most modest and most affecting track on the record, and one of the best things Bono has ever sung.\\" Time Out called it \\"the absolute highlight without any doubt\\" of the album, while The Guardian referred to it as \\"unadorned, evocative and suggestive\\", commenting that \\"you don't even have to know what it's about to feel its quiet power or sense its sadness\\". Mojo had a more negative impression of the song, stating \\"the music is as lumpy as the words.\\" \\"White as Snow\\" appears as the fourth track in the Anton Corbijn film Linear, based on a story by Corbijn and Bono where a Parisian traffic cop travels across France and the Mediterranean Sea to visit his girlfriend in Tripoli. During the sequence, the cop, played by Sa√Ød Taghmaoui, pulls off the road and watches the clouds as they form into the shape of the African continent before falling asleep. It ends with him waking up and resuming his journey, where the next track, \\"No Line on the Horizon\\", begins.

Prior to his work in journalism, Krohn wrote and self-published the book Defining Conservatism, in which he sought to outline core conservative principles. He gained national attention when he addressed the 2009 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), at age 13. Krohn convinced skeptical organizers to allow him to speak for three minutes at the CPAC event on February 27, 2009. His speech was well-received by the audience and later gained popularity on the internet, garnering Krohn's attention on national news programs on CNN and the Fox News Channel. In 2009, he was a finalist for Time magazine's Time 100 for the year. His second book, Defining Conservatism: The Principles That Will Bring Our Country Back, was released on February 9, 2010.\\"Defining Conservatism\\" book information and release date Retrieved March 13, 2010. In 2011, Krohn openly declared he no longer held conservative views, a change he attributed to his study of philosophers and maturing with age. Early life Krohn, an only child, was born on March 1, 1995 to Doug Krohn, a computer system integrator, and Marla Krohn, a sales representative and middle-school drama and speech teacher. Krohn's family lived in Duluth, Georgia, and has been active in a Baptist church. In 2006, he was voted \\"Atlanta's Most Talented Child\\" by Inside Edition. Krohn became interested in politics at age eight, after hearing about a Democratic filibuster on judicial nominations in the United States Senate. The event prompted him to research American history and governmental rules and policies, and he developed an affinity for conservatism and began to listen regularly to conservative talk radio, particularly Morning in America with William Bennett, to whom he became a regular caller. Krohn wrote Defining Conservatism, which was self-published in 2008, when he was 13 years old, because he felt the term conservatism was often misused. The book was in part a response to criticism that John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential candidate, received regarding his conservative credentials. The book outlines four fundamental principles of conservative thought: support for the United States Constitution, opposition to abortion, less government, and more personal responsibility. Krohn went on to apply the principles to current events and define whether specifically cited actions violated those principles. The book was dedicated to Ronald Reagan, William F. Buckley, Jr. and Barry Goldwater, whom Krohn describes as his political heroes, along with South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint. Krohn paid to have the book published from his own savings. He described it as a \\"first effort\\" and immediately planned to write a second one, which he said would focus in part on Alexander Hamilton and James Monroe. In January 2009, Krohn contacted organizers of the Conservative Political Action Conference and asked to speak at the event. Organizers were reportedly skeptical but gave him a three-minute spot on a panel about grassroots activists. He delivered the speech, on February 27, 2009, and described the conservative principles outlined in his book. When the speech was over, the panel moderator said, \\"Watch out, David Keene,\\" referring to the chairman of the American Conservative Union. The next day at the conference, William Bennett said, \\"I used to work for Ronald Reagan and now I'm a colleague of Jonathan Krohn's!\\" The speech attracted the attention of national media outlets and became popular online. Sam Stein of The Huffington Post said of the speech, \\"It was filled with the type of rhetorical flow and emotional pitch one would expect from a seasoned hand. Except, [he] is more than four years away from being able to vote.\\" After the conference, Krohn's parents received hate mail accusing them of brainwashing their son, but both insist Krohn developed his own political thinking. Within a week of the speech, Krohn appeared on numerous TV and radio shows. A staff member for a potential candidate for Georgia governor also asked to meet with him. Several Facebook fan pages were started for him, including one called \\"Jonathan Krohn 2032\\", a reference to the first year he will be eligible to run for President of the United States. Krohn wrote a column for Human Events, a weekly conservative newspaper. Krohn wrote a second book, Defining Conservatism: The Principles That Will Bring Our Country Back, released February 2010. The book was praised by former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and syndicated radio host Mike Gallagher, who said of it, \\"Any time I am depressed about the state of the country or the future of the modern conservative movement, I consider two words: Jonathan Krohn.\\" Gingrich offered to write the foreword for the book, but Krohn wanted it to be written by William Bennett. Krohn attended the 2010 Conservative Political Action Conference, but did not have a speaking role. Krohn also spoke at several Tea Party protests. Change in political views In 2011, the French conservative media Nouvelles de France revealed that Jonathan Krohn was not conservative anymore. In 2012, he confirmed to Politico that he no longer considers himself a conservative, and in fact takes a liberal point of view on many issues, including same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care Act. He also said that if he were old enough to vote in the 2012 presidential election, he would vote for Barack Obama.MSNBC Hardball July 3, 2012 However, he refused to describe himself as liberal, instead rejecting ideological labels entirely. Krohn attributes his change to reading works of philosophers such as Nietzsche and Wittgenstein. He said that he rejected social conservatism first, before rejecting other conservative viewpoints. Krohn stated that he had matured and described his 13-year-old self as \\"naive\\". In a Salon article, Krohn was critical of partisan politics in general, and conservatives in particular, describing his conservative critics as \\"scorned right-wingers showing all the maturity of a little boy.\\" In an interview with Jian Ghomeshi on CBC Radio subsequent to the Salon article, Krohn pointed out that his critics were so shallow that they claimed he should not have been reading philosophy at only 17 years of age.

In fact, the original playhouse was ‚Äòbuilt‚Äô inside a building in a centuries- old stone friary‚Ä¶ Nowadays, we would consider [the playhouse] just interior decoration or remodeling.‚Äù Production history The company's first production was Hamlet, Act 1, Scene 1 in February 2008, which was followed by Act 3, Scene 2 in April. In June 2008 the company took a break from Hamlet and started to work on a staged reading (not performance) of Twelfth Night. On September 12, 2008, the company opened their first modern play, One‚Äôs a Pawn of Time by Mike Dedrian. The company then returned to Twelfth Night and staged the first act of the play starting in November, 2008. No full-length Shakespearean play has been produced due to funding issues. In December 2008 the company developed Shakespeare on Ice as part of the Second Life: On Winter Solstice 2008. Shakespeare on Ice was a 24-hour ongoing festival which revived characters and plots from previous SL Shakespeare Company productions, with the aim to entertain and educate. In February 2009 the company started work on Twelfth Night, Act 1: The Open Ended Run, which premiered on March 1 and ran every Sunday and every Tuesday until the companies closure on October 29. Ina Centaur closed with this statement \\"The Shakespeare Primtings sLiterary and Skin City sims will go down on Oct 29 or thereabouts. The process in which sims are deactivated is not usually punctual ‚Äì we aren‚Äôt sure exactly when the executioners would finally pull the plug, but when they do, it will be the end of our Second Life.\\" Centaur, Ina. \\"Our Magic and Our Passing ‚Äì Goodbye from the SL Shakespeare Company, Primtings, and sLiterary\\", SL Shakespeare Company Blog 2009-2010. Retrieved 2012-10-23. Technology The technological aspects of the play rely mainly on bot technology which could be categorised in two main groups i.e. Infobots that are based on archived data and Avabots characterised by some AI which real-time live input by actors. The Avabots are synched with the actors' gestures and animations according to their lines. Animation Avatars in Second Life move from place-to-place in real time under human control, however body poses and facial expressions are limited to pre-defined animations and scripts. Metaverse Shakespeare Company productions augments this, including two ways: by creating new animations, and with post- production lip sync. In the Second Life virtual world, one has the ability to either watch events from a static position, or to move the view to a place that is away from one‚Äôs avatar. Thus, while in Second Life, the viewer can zoom, or choose any angle from which to watch the animations. This requires the representations of the stage actors to be viewable even at a close distance. Actors' bodies and costumes The avatar character bodies for Hamlet were created to suit each character, while a wardrobe resembling historically correct clothing was purpose-built, or assembled from Second Life vendors. In Twelfth Night the emphasis on period clothing was relaxed. Budget Much of the design and production work is volunteer. Other expenses for 2009 are L$1,510,000 (approximately US$5830), which is largely to pay Second Life for land sufficient to support large audiences. =Financial problems= In May, 2011, Ina Centaur shared her fear in an emotional blog post that two sims from the 4-Sim SL Globe Theatre would be deleted later on in the year and hence the theatre itself would go down as well. Her account in Second Life was already locked and though Primting and Shakespeare managed to cover their tier costs through donations, it was unlikely that The Globe Theatre would be saved. In an adieu post, the Metaverse Shakespeare company announced that Shakespeare, Primtings, sLiterary and Skin City sims which would go down at the end 2011 due to high tier costs and insufficient fundings. Although the company tried to raise enough profit through various sponsorship campaigns, season ticket deals and tickets for opening night. Increase in revenue in SL as there are only few who pay entry fees for an attraction. Further, the post depicts reasons for Ina Centaur's decision to quit.

Killzone consists of six games, beginning on the PlayStation 2 in November 2004 with Killzone, and continued on the PlayStation Portable in October 2006 with Killzone: Liberation. Killzone 2 was released for the PlayStation 3 in February 2009, and Killzone 3 was released in February 2011, also for the PlayStation 3.

Plot synopsis The series is set in the 24th century, showing the galactic war between the Interplanetary Strategic Alliance (ISA) and the Helghan Empire. The Killzone series follows the continuous war between the ISA and Helghast taking place on both ISA Earth colonies and the planet Helghan, the home planet of the Helghast. The series has featured four main protagonists: Cpt/Col. Jan Templar (Killzone and Killzone: Liberation), Sgt. Tomas \\"Sev\\" Sevchenko (Killzone 2 and Killzone 3), mercenary Arran Danner (Killzone: Mercenary), and Shadow Marshal Lucas Kellan (Killzone Shadow Fall). The main antagonist was originally Helghast Autarch Scolar Visari; his death in Killzone 2 brought about the rise of two new antagonists and the hopeful heirs to Visari's throne in Killzone 3: Jorhan Stahl and Admiral Orlock. After Orlock's death and the unknown details of Stahl's death and the destruction of Helghan, now covered in petrusite, the Helghast now live on Vekta with a giant wall dividing them from the Vektans. \\"The Black Hand\\", a Helghast paramilitary terrorist group, was formed under Vladko Tyran, who became an antagonist, along with Lady Hera Visari (Scolar Visari's daughter) who has inherited her father's throne. By the end of Killzone Shadow Fall, it is revealed that the main antagonist is Stahl, who managed to survive the events of Killzone 3, but is dispatched by Vektan Security Agency director Thomas Sinclair. Gameplay Killzone, Killzone 2, Killzone 3, Killzone: Mercenary, and Killzone Shadow Fall are first-person shooters. Killzone: Liberation is presented as an isometric twin sticks shooter.

Players can carry two different weapons at any given time. Players can either obtain ammo or swap out their current weapons with any weapon dropped by a downed foe or from those scattered around the various maps.

Vekta's orbital Strategic Defense (S.D.) platforms failed during the initial assault, allowing the Helghast to land swarms of soldiers onto the surface and making it difficult for the outnumbered ISA forces. Captain Jan Templar, the main protagonist, and his squad are ordered back to the base for reassignment, and are sent to find the ISA operative Hakha and the key in his possession. Templar meets other characters who assist him such as Shadow Marshal Luger (a female special operations assassin), a heavy weapons specialist Sergeant Rico Velasquez (a Helghast-hating soldier with an itchy trigger finger), and Colonel Hakha, a half-Helghast, half-Human spy.

Family-centered service is made up of a set of values, attitudes, and approaches to services for children with special needs and their families. In some family-centered settings such as the Hasbro Children's Partial Hospital Program, medical and psychiatric services are integrated to help teach parents and children methods to treat illness and disease. Family-centered service recognizes that each family is unique; that the family is the constant in the child's life; and that they are the experts on the child's abilities and needs. The family works with service providers to make informed decisions about the services and supports the child and family receive. In family- centered service, the strengths and needs of all family members are consideredPamela J. Kovacsa; Melissa Hayden Bellinb; David P. Fauria (2006). \\"Family-Centered Care\\", Journal of Social Work in End-Of-Life & Palliative Care, Volume 2, Issue 1 July 2006 , pages 13 - 27. Family-centered service reflects a shift from the traditional focus on the biomedical aspects of a child's condition to a concern with seeing the child in context of their family and recognizing the primacy of family in the child's life. The principles argue in favor of an approach that respects families as integral and coequal parts of the health care team. This approach is expected to improve the quality and safety of a patient's care by helping to foster communication between families and health care professionals. Furthermore, by taking family/patient input and concerns into account, the family feels comfortable working with professionals on a plan of care, and professionals are \\"on board\\" in terms of what families expect with medical interventions and health outcomes. In some health systems, patients and family members serve as advisers to the hospital in order to provide input that can lead to general quality improvement efforts. Family-centered approaches to health care intervention also generally lead to wiser allocation of health care resources, as well as greater patient and family satisfaction. Family ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù means any person(s) who plays a significant role in an individual's life. This may include a person(s) not legally related to the individual who act as advocates. Members of ‚Äúfamily‚Äù include spouses, domestic partners, and both different-sex and same-sex significant others. ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù includes a minor patient's parent or parents, regardless of the gender of either parent. Solely for purposes of visitation policy, the concept of parenthood is to be liberally construed without limitation as encompassing legal parents, foster parents, same-sex parent, stepparents, those serving in loco parentis (in place of the parent), and other persons operating in caretaker roles. This definition of family was developed in consultation with the Healthcare Equality Index Advisory Council, Gay and Lesbian Medical Association and Joint Commission staff members. Like the majority of the definitions of ‚Äúfamily‚Äù contained in submitted hospital policy, this definition establishes a broad and encompassing concept of family. The specifically enumerated members of family provide guidance to staff and prevent biased interpretation to the contrary. The concept of ‚Äúdomestic partners‚Äù contained in this definition encompasses not only domestic partnerships, but all legally recognized same- sex relationships, including civil unions and reciprocal beneficiary arrangements. The definition also focuses on a functional definition of parenthood as established by the individual's role as caretaker of a minor child. This is designed to ensure visitor access for the individuals most responsible for the care of a minor patient, even if this caretaker relationship lacks formal recognition under applicable state law. This definition of ‚Äúfamily‚Äù places hospital personnel on notice as to the unique nature of parenthood in the visitation context. While the definition requires that caretaker-individuals be granted access to visit minor patients, this caretaker status does not necessarily carry with it the rights that accompany legal parental status. For instance, applicable state law may dictate that only a biological or custodial parent may determine the course of medical care for a minor child. Role of the family While specific methods of implementing family-centered care approach differs from facility to facility, procedures are fairly similar. On admission, the patient usually designates one or two people who will serve as their primary \\"care partners\\". The admitting staff discuss the reasons for admission with the patient and their \\"care partners\\" and what health criteria are required for the patient's discharge. \\"Care partners\\" are then intricately involved with the patient's care by their entire attending healthcare team, including physicians, nurses, nutritionists, social workers, and more. At every stage, \\"care partners\\" and patients discuss with healthcare professionals test results, the state of the patient's current health, what type of things to expect throughout the day, and discharge goals. \\"Care partners\\" are invited to take part in nursing interventions, including bathing, feeding, helping the nursing staff with moving the patient, and assisting the patient in exercising or moving about the unit. \\"Care partners\\" are also invited to take an active role in \\"rounds,\\" providing feedback and asking questions reflective of theirs and the patient's wishes or concerns. \\"Care partners\\" are also indoctrinated on various elements of hospital operating policy, such as quiet time and visitation rules. The \\"care partners\\" are then generally allowed to manage the adherence to these policies in a manner conducive to the patient's healing and common sense‚Äîfor example, by managing how many visitors are present in the patient's room. Advantages and disadvantages Family-centered care emerged as an important concept in health care at the end of the 20th century; but the implementation of Family Centered care was met with a variety of snags. Prior to the early 1990s, the relationship between care providers and patients was distant. The traditional model of care centered on physicians, and an expectation that patients and their families would assume a passive role as an observer, rather than a participant. Healing was treated largely as an abstract or business- like affair. Special requests by the patient were seen as interfering with the provision of their care or even as being a detriment to their health. Modern ideas like open visitation or care partners were almost unheard of and were generally dismissed as impossible to accomplish. This was compounded by the implementation of Health Maintenance Organizations, which successfully reigned in the rising healthcare costs of the 1970s at the cost of the patient- healthcare worker relationship. Much of the early work on Family Centered care emerged from the pediatric and geriatric medicine fields; for example, as research came to light about the effects of separating hospitalized children from their families, many healthcare institutions began to adopt policies that welcomed family members to be with their child around the clock. As awareness increased of the importance of meeting the psychosocial and holistic needs of not only children, but all patients, the family-centered care model began to make serious headway as a bonafide intervention model. In the United States, this was further encouraged by Federal legislation in the late 1980s and early 1990s that provided additional validation on the importance of family-centered principles.Public Law 99-457, Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments of 1986, Part H‚ÄîEarly Intervention Programs for Handicapped Infants and ToddlersIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-476)Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-496) Beginning in the mid-1990s (although elements of family- centered care began appearing in the early 1980s), however, this situation began to change. Studies began to show that many of the supposed detriments to family-centered care were negligible, not supported by research, or untrue. A study conducted in 2001Lee, Melissa D. MD; Friedenberg, Allison S. MD; Mukpo, David H.; Conray, Kayla; Palmisciano, Amy RN; Levy, Mitchell M. MD. (2007). Visiting hours policies in New England intensive care units: Strategies for Improvement. Critical Care Medicine, Volume 35(2), pages 497-501. showed that open visitation had little to no effect on physiologic parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, cardiac arrhythmias, and intercranial pressure. Indeed, evidence suggested anxiety levels and general cardiovascular health were positively affected after the implementation of family-centered care, leading to fewer medical interventions being required (physical or chemical therapies in particular).Damboise, Cindy and Cardin, Suzette. (2003). Family Centered Critical Care: How one unit implemented a plan. American Journal of Nursing, Volume 103, Issue 6, pages 56AA-56EE. Another area of concern, septic and infection control, found that as long as a patient's visitors were educated in the proper aseptic procedure (such as hand washing and use of handsanitizer gel), infection control outcomes were not negatively affected by unrestricted visitation. Patient care was also positively affected. Decubidation rates in facilities with family-centered care dropped significantly. In one study, it was found that patients receiving family-centered care were far more likely to have met the criteria of medical and nursing care plans (such as drinking x amount of fluids every eight hours, moving from NP suctioning to bulb suctioning, or the measurement of patient's intake/output), as the patient's family took it upon themselves to encourage or assist the patient in accomplishing these goals.Insert FMC-article link here Family and close friends were more likely to identify slight variations in the patient's mental or physical health that health care professionals largely unfamiliar with the patient may miss. Furthermore, while health care professionals are very talented at their work, their jobs are generally limited by the walls of the health care facility, whereas a patient's family is not. Enlisting a patient's family as a part of their health care team helps enable their ability to assist, manage, and assess the patient's healing after their discharge from a health care facility. A study undertaken at the University of Virginia's Children's HospitalUniversity of Virginia Children's Hospital showed that sharing information and involving family in a patient's care (via the family-centered care model described previously) had the following effects: * A rise in staff satisfaction due to reduced phone calls by security at night; * Improved consistency of information given to family members; * A decrease in clinical workload; and * A significant rise in patient satisfaction scores on the Press-Ganey scale in the areas of Accommodations and Comfort of Visitors (93 to 98), Information Provided to Family (87 to 99), Staff Attitudes Towards Visitors (62 to 75), and Safety and Security Felt at the Hospital (86 to 88)Tops in the Nation -- Press Ganey Announces 2006 Health Care AwardsBickley, L.

A study conducted at eight hospitals demonstrated that implementing family-centered rounds, an intervention to standardize communication between families and healthcare providers, reduced the rate of harmful medical errors. A research study published in Denmark in 2015, examined the effect of nursing support on parents of children admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. The study resulted in an increased satisfaction from parents of the support provided by nurses who were trained with the NPST, the Nurse Parent Support Tool manual .

Its name is based on the location in which it was created, the Otta Valley. Otta seal was developed to be used as a temporary surfacing on new roads; however, after seeing its strength, it has been used as permanent roads as well.http://www4.worldbank.org/afr/ssatp/Resources/HTML/LVSR/English/Added-2007/2007-Otta- Seal-Guide-by-ChOverby-MPinard.pdf Composition and application Otta seal is formed by adding graded aggregate to a soft bituminous binding agent. The agent is usually emulsified asphalt. Bituminous binder application rates are between 1.9 liter/m2 (0.42 US gallon/yard2) and 2.4 liter/m2 (0.53 US gallon/yard2) ‚Äì the value is dependent on aggregate gradation and type. Low quality, local aggregates are often used in Otta seal. The largest aggregate size used is between 13 and 25mm (0.5 and 1 inch). The aggregate can contain up to 10% fine gravels. Aggregate quantities are usually close to 27 kg/m2 (50 lbs/yard2). Otta seal is easily cured by blinding with sand because of its soft binders. The soft binders quickly coat the sand; This is not possible for seals with harder binders. Cutback bitumens in the viscosity range of MC3000 to MC800 are the most common binders used.http://www.kzntransport.gov.za/reading_room/research/general/LVR8_Paper.pdf Otta seal is formed in the following procedure: # Remove dust and foreign objects from the base. # Add small amounts of water to the base to suppress dust. # Apply a hot binder at a rate of 1.6 to 1.9 liters/m2. # Apply aggregate at a rate of 1.3 to 2.0 m3 to 100m2 (depending on the grading of the aggregate) of road surface. # Flatten the Otta seal using a tired roller until binder is pressing up between the aggregate particles. This usually has to be done multiple times, typically several days after the first flattening. # For the first two to three weeks, allow traffic at low speeds to assist with further kneading. Aggregates will be dislodged by traffic and they should be broomed back onto the seal. Where Otta seal is used Otta seal is primarily used in places that do not have strict requirements for strength, grading, particle shape, binder adhesion, and dust content, which have low capital and expect relatively low traffic (up to 500 vehicles per day).http://www.dot.state.mn.us/materials/bituminousdocs/Pavement%20Maintenance/OttaSeal_4-pagerMRR_2008.pdf Currently, Otta seal is most prevalent in Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and Botswana and common in Bangladesh, Australia, and parts of Africa. Political impact Politically Otta seal is a useful alternative versus other types of road surfaces. A city council member of a city that uses Otta seal explained that it is very cost efficient since with Otta seal they can resurface a road every 5‚Äì10 years without having to tear the whole road up every time it needs to be resurfaced. This lengthens the road life and makes it very economical. Social impact Otta seal does not cause prolonged delays in traffic, it takes few hours to resurface a road and is usable almost immediately afterwards. Since this is mainly used on side roads it is important that it is done quickly to prevent people from not being able to get to their houses. One negative impact is the loose gravel can cause chips or damage to windshields, but odds of this happening is lowered in slower moving traffic areas. Environmental impact Environmentally Otta seal helps to lower the dust level. This helps the environment in many ways; helps with driving visibility, decrease health problems caused by dust, and reduce harm done to crops. Another environmental benefit is that the materials used in its production are easily acceptable. There is also a reduction in environmental degradation. Costs Otta seal is considered to be a low cost seal. With its low initial cost and less demanding maintenance, it is a very cheap alternative for road surfaces. The cost for a double layer Otta seal is about US $2.00 to US $2.70 per square meter (US $2.40 to US $3.25 per square yard) and will last from 8 to 15 years. For a road that is 1.6 km (1 mile) long and 12 m (40 feet) wide it would cost between US $39,000 to US $52,000.http://www.cflhd.gov/programs/techDevelopment/pavement/context- roadway-surfacing/documents/roadway-surfacing-photos/ch1-c-asphalt.pdf Physical properties Otta seal is a type of road surfacing consisting of a bituminous binding substance and aggregate rocks ranging from gravel to fine particles. It is stronger than similar inexpensive surfacing techniques such as chip seal. The type of bitumen used can greatly affect the strength of the road. Bitumen binders that are more viscous tend to move through the aggregate faster, but are not as hard and cannot handle heavier loads. A huge advantage of Otta seal over other seals is the ability to use almost any type or size of crushed rocks as the aggregate. Depending on where in the world the road is being constructed and therefore what types of rock are available, the strength of an Otta seal can vary greatly. Commonly, the gravel used contains sandstone, basalt, and even coral or volcanic stones. Also, size of the particles varies greatly, with a preferred maximum of 16 mm and 19 mm (0.63 inch and 0.75 inch) for single and double Otta seals, respectively. Typically, the concentration of fine particles of less than 0.075 mm (0.003 inch) should be less than 10%. Adhesive agents are generally added to increase the strength between the aggregate and the bituminous binder. It is this interaction that gives Otta seal its strength and durability.http://www.govengr.com/ArticlesNov10/Otta%20Seal.pdf Molecular structure Since Otta seal is a combination of materials, it is beneficial to look at the molecular structures of the materials used. Rocks are in the material family of ceramics. They have very rigid crystalline structures that stand up well to compressive forces. In contrast, sheer or tensile forces can easily form cracks in ceramics and cause failure. The bitumen acts the opposite way. It is more amorphous, meaning it is weaker under compressive forces, but can hold the rocks together and limit cracking under tensile stress. The bitumen molecular structure is composed mostly of compressed hydrocarbons, sometimes containing many other elements like nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and nickel.http://www.owenscorning.com/trumbull/resources/downloads/asphalt_model.pdf Pros and cons of Otta seal There are many factors when considering what type of road surfacing is necessary.http://www.cflhd.gov/programs/techDevelopment/pavement/context- roadway-surfacing/documents/context5-append-a1.pdf Most advantages to Otta seal over other inexpensive surfacing techniques spring from its ability to use a wide range of materials and material sizes during construction. Pros and cons are listed here: =Pros= * Can be used in remote areas with whatever gravel is available * Less waste when using crushed material * Cheaper, lower grade materials can be used * More tolerant of pavement deflection * Much less precise proportions, resulting in fewer mistakes * More durable and less maintenance * Workers require very little technical skill * Creates job opportunities * Resistance to cracking from solar radiation * Impermeable, so water can run off * Can be used in any climate * Can be broken down and reused =Cons= * Requires more material * The need for experienced people in charge of operations * The need for experienced people to do maintenance * Grade cannot exceed 8% for single Otta seal (12% for double) * Must be applied at above 10¬∞C (50¬∞F) Durability and weathering Otta seal is more durable than many alternative seals. It is impermeable and resistant to cracking from the sun‚Äôs radiation. Cracks form in all roads due to changes in temperature, but Otta seal performs better than other seals. Overall, Otta seal can be expected to last 50 to 60 percent longer than a chip seal. This results in a lifespan between 6 and 12 years if properly maintained, and even longer if a sand seal is used on top of the Otta seal.

These include various diseases of the back or spine (\\"dorso-\\"), such as kyphosis. Dorsalgia refers to back pain. Some other spinal diseases include spinal muscular atrophy, ankylosing spondylitis, lumbar spinal stenosis, spina bifida, spinal tumors, osteoporosis and cauda equina syndrome. Types There are many recognized spinal diseases, some more common than others. Spinal disease also includes cervical spine diseases, which are diseases in the vertebrae of the neck. A lot of flexibility exists within the cervical spine and because of that, it is common for an individual to damage that area, especially over a long period of time. Some of the common cervical spine diseases include degenerative disc disease, cervical stenosis, and cervical disc herniation. Degenerative disc disease occurs over time when the discs within each vertebra in the neck begin to fall apart and begin to disintegrate. Because each vertebra can cause pain in different areas of the body, the pain from the disease can be sensed in the back, leg, neck area, or even the arms. When the spinal canal begins to lose its gap and gets thinner, it can cause pain in the neck, which can also cause a numb feeling in the arms and hands. Those are symptoms of cervical stenosis disease. The discs between each vertebra have fibers that can begin to deteriorate, and this can occur in cervical disc herniation. This disease is less common in younger people as it is usually a function of aging. =Scoliosis= Scoliosis is a common spinal disease in which the spine has a curvature usually in the shape of the letter \\"C\\" or \\"S\\". This is most common in girls, but there is no specific cause for scoliosis. Only a few symptoms occur for one with this disease, which include feeling tired in the spinal region or backaches. Generally, if the hips or shoulders are uneven, or if the spine curves, it is due to scoliosis and should be seen by a doctor. = Lumbar spinal stenosis = Lumbar spinal stenosis is classified as a narrowing of the spinal canal in the lumbar region of the vertebrae. This may lead to compression of the nerve root of the spinal cord and result in pain of the lower back and lower extremities. Other symptoms include impaired walking and a slightly stooped posture due to loss of disc height and bulging of the disc. Lumbar spinal stenosis is very prevalent with 9.3% of the general population producing symptoms and the number is continuing to rise in patients older than 60. It's generally an indication for spinal surgery in patients older than 65 years of age. = Spina bifida = Spina bifida is the most common defect impacting the Central Nervous System (CNS). The most common and most severe form of Spina Bifida is Myelomeningocele. Individuals with Myelomeningocele are born with an incompletely fused spine, and therefore exposing the spinal cord through an opening in the back. In general, the higher the spinal lesion, the greater the functional impairment to the individual. Symptoms may include bowel and bladder problems, weakness and/or loss of sensation below the level of the lesion, paralysis, or orthopedic issues. Severity of symptoms can vary per situation. = Cauda equina syndrome = Cauda equina syndrome is a rare syndrome that effects the spinal nerves in the region of the lower back called the cauda equine (Latin for \\"horses tail\\"). Injury to the cauda equine can have long lasting ramifications for the individual. Symptoms include lower back pain, bladder disturbances, bowel dysfunction, and anesthesia or paresthesia between the thighs. In order to prevent progressive neurological changes surgery can be a viable option. =Tumors= A spinal tumor is when unusual tissue begins growing and spreading in the spinal columns or spinal cords. The unusual tissue builds up from abnormal cells that multiply quickly in a specific region. Tumors generally are broken down into categories known as benign, meaning non-cancerous, or malignant, meaning cancerous, and also primary or secondary. Primary spinal tumors begin in either the spinal cord or spinal column, whereas secondary spinal tumors begin elsewhere and spread to the spinal region. Symptoms for spinal tumors may vary due to factors such as the type of tumor, the region of the spine, and the health of the patient. Back pain is the most common symptom and it can be a problem if the pain is severe, has a time frame that lasts longer than it would for a normal injury, and becomes worse while laying down or at rest. Other symptoms, excluding back pains, are loss of muscle function, loss of bowel or bladder function, pain in the legs, scoliosis, or even unusual sensations in the legs. The primary tumor has no known cause, although there are possible answers that scientists have researched. Cancer may be linked to genes because research shows that in certain families, the incidents of spinal tumors are higher. Two of the genetic disorders that may affect spinal tumors, include Von Hippel-Lindau disease and Neurofibromatosis 2. Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a non-cancerous tumor of blood vessels that occur in the brain, spinal cord, or even tumors in the kidneys. The Neuroflibromatosis 2 is a non-cancerous tumor that usually affects the nerves for hearing. Loss of hearing in one or both ears, is a common effect of this genetic disorder.

Huelskamp, a member of the Republican Party, was rated the least bipartisan member of the House during the 114th Congress by The Lugar Center - McCourt school Bipartisan Index. Prior to entering Congress, he represented the 38th district of the Kansas Senate from 1997 until 2011. Huelskamp, who was known for his strong social conservatism, was the chairman of the House Tea Party Caucus from February 2015 until he left office in 2017. He ran for re-election in 2016 but was defeated in the Republican primary on August 2, 2016, by Roger Marshall. His term in the House ended on January 3, 2017. Early life and education Huelskamp was born on November 11, 1968 and raised on the Huelskamp family farm in Fowler, south of Dodge City. Pioneered by his grandparents Martin and Clara in 1926, the farm operation includes raising corn, cattle, wheat, milo, and soybeans. He attended elementary and high school in Fowler, where he was a Farm Bureau Youth Leader, a member of St. Anthony's Parish, and active in both 4-H and Future Farmers of America. After attending seminary for two years in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Huelskamp continued his education at the College of Santa Fe (now Santa Fe University of Art and Design) and received his B.A. in social science education in 1991. He received his Ph.D. in political science, concentrating in agricultural policy from the American University in 1995. Kansas SenateElections= In 1996, Huelskamp challenged Republican incumbent state senator Marian Reynolds in the primary and won by a landslide margin, taking 62 percent of the vote to Reynolds's 38 percent. The youngest state senator in 20 years, he then won re-election by wide margins in 2000, 2004 and 2008. =Committee assignments= Huelskamp served on the following legislative committees:Profile from the Kansas Legislature * Joint Committee on Information Technology (Chairman) * Education * Ethics and Local Government (Chairman) Huelskamp previously served on the state's Ways and Means Committee but was removed due to clashes with colleagues and with the Committee's leadership.Huelskamp ad under scrutiny, Tim Carpenter, Topeka Capital-Journal, July 20, 2010 U.S. House of RepresentativesElections= ;2010 Seven- term Congressman Jerry Moran gave up the Big First seat to make a successful run for the United States Senate seat being vacated by the popular fourteen- year incumbent Republican Sam Brownback, who was running for governor that year. This touched off a free-for-all in the Republican primary‚Äîthe real contest in this heavily Republican district. Huelskamp finished first in the six-candidate primary field with 34.8 percent of the vote, all but assuring that he would be the district's next representative. Huelskamp ran against Democratic nominee Alan Jilka and Libertarian nominee Jack W. Warner. Huelskamp was endorsed by the Club for Growth, Mike Huckabee, Conservative Leadership PAC, Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee, Ron Paul and Ken Blackwell. As expected, Huelskamp won the seat in a rout, taking 73 percent of the vote. ;2012 Huelskamp ran unopposed in the general election. ;2014 Unlike the previous election, Huelskamp was challenged by a Republican, Alan LaPolice, in the primary. Moreover, two Democrats ran for the primary Jim Sherow, a Kansas State University professor, and Bryan Whitney, a 2013 Wichita State University grad. Both LaPolice and Sherow critiqued Huelskamp for his failure to work with other Members of Congress and voting against Farm Bill. Huelskamp narrowly defeated LaPolice in the Republican Primary with only 55% of the vote. Huelskamp failed to receive the endorsement of the Farm Bureau and the Kansas Livestock Association. Huelskamp went on to win the general election with 68% of the vote. ;2016 Huelskamp was defeated in the Republican primary by Roger Marshall, an obstetrician from Great Bend, by 58% to 42%. Marshall's supporters argued Huelskamp's combativeness hurt the district. House leadership had removed Huelskamp from the House Agriculture Committee in 2012; farm groups such as Kansas Farm Bureau, an affiliate of the American Farm Bureau Federation, Kansas Livestock Association, an affiliate of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, National Association of Wheat Growers and the US Chamber of Commerce endorsed Marshall, as many Republican voters saw it as a crucial issue in a farm state. =Legislative activity= In early 2012, Huelskamp introduced legislation that would ensure military chaplains could not be \\"directed, ordered or required to perform any duty, rite, ritual, ceremony, service or function that is contrary to the conscience, moral principles or religious beliefs of the chaplain, or contrary to the moral principles or religious beliefs of the chaplain's faith group.\\" The language appeared to be related to permitting same-sex marriages on military bases in states where such unions are permitted.Hoskinson, Charles, \\"Don't Ask Don't Tell: War over gays in military in new phase\\", Politico, February 1, 2012. =Sovereign debt crisis= On February 16, 2012, during a contentious three- hour House Budget Committee hearing with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, Huelskamp warned of what he considered to be the looming threat of an economic crisis similar to the one then taking place in Europe. Huelskamp accused Geithner and the entire Obama administration of failing to correct the U.S.'s debt crisis, which he believed would lead the country down the same path. Geithner replied that Huelskamp had an \\"adolescent perspective on how to think about economic policy.\\" =Defense of Marriage Act Constitutional Amendment= After the United States Supreme Court declared the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) unconstitutional on June 26, 2013,Supreme Court DOMA Decision Rules Federal Same-Sex Marriage Ban Unconstitutional Huffington Post ‚Äì June 26, 2013 Huelskamp immediately announced that he would introduce a constitutional amendment to restore the Defense of Marriage Act.

La La La La La-La La-La-La is an EP by English post-punk band the Chameleons, released 1 October 1990 on record label Glass Pyramid. It consists of the Chameleons' final recordings in 1987 prior to their breakup.  Content  The EP was named after the band's manager from 1986‚Äì87, Tony Fletcher. The song \\"Free for All\\" was named after an episode of the 1960s television programme The Prisoner.  Recording  In 1987, the Chameleons were ready to record their fourth studio album, to be released on Geffen. The band recorded four songs which were supposed to be released prior to the full album. Fletcher died of a heart attack just two days before these songs were recorded, and the band broke up acrimoniously soon after.  Release  In 1990, the band's main songwriter, Mark Burgess, formed the record label Glass Pyramid to help pay off the band's debts. The still-unused tracks from the 1987 Geffen session were to be used as the first Glass Pyramid release. Tony Fletcher Walked on Water was released on 1 October 1990. 1,100 copies were pressed for each format of CD and 12\\" vinyl. However, due to legal threats by guitarist Dave Fielding, the EP never made it to shops.

Its current assignment is with the 55th Electronic Combat Group at Davis‚ÄìMonthan Air Force Base, Arizona as a geographically separated unit from its parent wing, the 55th Wing at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. The squadron is the Air Force's sole Lockheed EC-130H Compass Call formal training unit. Mission Provides the 55th Electronic Combat Group with combat ready Lockheed EC-130H Compass Call trained aircrews. Directs all EC-130H aircrew initial academic and flying qualification, difference and requalification training for 20 different aircrew specialties with more than 200 aircrew students trained annually. Provides registrar support to students. Maintains quality control for all aspects of contracted aircrew training and manages courseware development for 17 Air Combat Command-verified syllabi. Provides the group with simulator support for both continuation and initial qualification training. History Constituted as 42 Reconnaissance Squadron, Very Long Range, Photographic, on 24 October 1945. Activated on 7 November 1945 at Smoky Hill Army Air Field, Kansas. Established under VIII Bomber Command, Continental Air Forces as a very long-range strategic reconnaissance squadron. Equipped with B-29 Superfortress bombers converted into F-13 reconnaissance/mapping configuration. Was designated to operate from Alaska, however squadron suffered from lack of personnel due to demobilization after the end of World War II, never became fully operational and was inactivated in August 1946. =Cold War European operations= Reactivated as part of the United States Air Forces in Europe in March 1954 at Spangdahlem Air Base, West Germany. Equipped with Douglas RB-26 Invader reconnaissance aircraft, painted in black to perform night reconnaissance which were transferred from the 1st Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron when the 1st received Martin RB-57A Canberras. RB-66C of the 42d Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron at ChelvestonDouglas RB-66C-DT Serial 54=470. This aircraft was used during the Vietnam War and was eventually scrapped at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa in 1973 In 1956 the B-26s were sent to reclamation and the squadron received twelve Douglas RB-66C Destroyers.Knaack, p. 443 The RB-66C was a specialized electronic reconnaissance and electronic countermeasures aircraft designed for jamming Soviet RADAR. Its mission was to fly with tactical fighter and fighter bomber aircraft and provide an aerial defense. An extensive suite of specialized equipment was fitted to locate and identify enemy radar emissions. Additional ECM equipment was carried in wingtip pods. Chaff dispensing pods could be carried underneath the wing outboard of the engine nacelles. In addition, it was fitted with a removable in flight refueling probe attached to the right side of the forward fuselage. In 1959 the squadron moved to the UK as part of a USAFE realignment. Its parent 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing was assigned to RAF Alconbury. A shortage of facilities at Alconbury led to the 42d being stationed at RAF Chelveston, about 20 miles west of Alconbury, where it remained as a detachment of the 10th TRW. In 1962 the runway at Chevelston was closed, and the squadron operated out of Toul-Rosieres AB, France, where it operated for a few years as Detachment 1, 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing. On 10 March 1964, a wing RB-66B took off from Toul for a mission over West Germany. Because of an equipment malfunction that was undetected by the crew, the plane continued its flight to East Germany and was shot down. The crew ejected safely, but was taken prisoner, although they were released before the end of the month. This incident prompted USAFE to institute a buffer zone, where special procedures were required for aircraft flying near the eastern border of West Germany.Knaack, p. 430 Starting in April 1964, thirteen of the squadron's RB-66Bs began to be modified under Project Brown Cradle, to update their electronic warfare equipment and make other modifications. By 1965 the aircraft modification had been completed. However, the service of the Brown Cradle aircraft with the squadron was short. In December five of the aircraft deployed to Southeast Asia, and in May 1966, the remaining eight aircraft joined them.Knaack, p. 439 These rotational deployments to France continued until October 1965 with the activation of the 25th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Chambley-Bussieres Air Base and the 42d being permanently assigned to the 25th Wing. With France's withdrawal from NATO's integrated military organization in 1966, Chambley was closed and the 25th Wing was inactivated. The specially-equipped EB-66C's of the 42d and their aircrews were sent directly to Southeast Asia for use over the skies of North Vietnam and the squadron was inactivated. =Vietnam War= Douglas RB-66B of the 42d Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron in 1968Douglas RB-66B-DL Destroyer 54-440 (converted to EB-66B), taken 25 December 1968. Douglas EB-66E Destroyer in flight in 1970Aircraft of the 41st or 42d Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron based at Takhli over Southeast Asia on 30 March 1970. Reactivated in 1968 at Takhli Royal Thai Air Base under the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing. The squadron carried out electronic warfare operations over North Vietnam, locating and identifying North Vietnamese radar sites that directed missiles and AAA fire, so that strike aircraft could avoid them. The RB-66C had no offensive capability, so it could not attack the radar sites directly. Squadron was transferred to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base in August 1970. Continued operations until the end of hostilities in January 1973, remained in Thailand until being inactivated in March 1974.Lt.Col. Iceal Hambleton, a navigator aboard an EB-66 who was shot down during the Easter Offensive and spent 11¬Ω days behind enemy lines, was a member of the squadron. His rescue was the \\"largest, longest, and most complex search-and-rescue\\" operation during the entire Vietnam War. The rescue was dramatized in the movie Bat*21. Zimmerman, p. 320 =Eldorado Canyon and Desert Storm= General Dynamics EF-111A of the 42nd Electronic Combat SquadronGeneral Dynamics EF-111A Serial 66-0049 Believed to have been used as electronic jammer aircraft in Operation El Dorado Canyon. This aircraft was put on display at Mountain Home Air Force Base Idaho. Reactivated in 1983 with General Dynamics EF-111A Ravens at RAF Upper Heyford, England, the replacement for the Douglas EB-66 electronic warfare aircraft. Performed ECM operations for NATO aircraft. Provided electronic countermeasures to US Navy aircraft for combat in Libya, 15 April 1986 as part of Operation El Dorado Canyon. During that mission, the 42d provided three EF-111As plus two spare aircraft to jam the Libyan radar network. Deployed flights to Turkey and Saudi Arabia in 1991 as part of Operation Desert Shield; engaged in combat operations in 1991 as part of Operation Desert Storm. Eighteen EF-111A Ravens flew over 900 sorties. None were lost in combat, but one was lost in a non-combat related accident and both crew members were killed. The 42d was even credited with a \\"kill\\" during Desert Storm. On the night of 17 January 1991, an Iraqi Mirage F.1 flew into the ground while chasing EF-111A serial number 66-16. Even though the Raven was unarmed and had no air-to-air capability, the Raven crew was given credit for the kill. This was originally believed to be true but after review of AWACS tapes and other data credit for the claim was withdrawn. The official award for the F.1 Mirage kill went to Capt Robert E. Graeter, 33 TFW, Special order CCAF SO GA-1, 1991, as a Maneuvering kill. Inactivated in 1992 as part of the post Cold War drawdown of the USAF, its aircraft reassigned to the 429th Electronic Combat Squadron at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico. =Airborne command post (ABCCC) Operations= In 1994, the squadron was reactivated and received the personnel and aircraft from the 7th Airborne Command and Control Squadron which provided procedural air control via the Airborne Battlefield Command and Control Center (ABCCC). The 7th Squadron moved on paper to Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska and assumed a new mission, the Airborne Command Post \\"Looking Glass\\" mission in support of nuclear command and control for United States Strategic Command, as part of this mission, the 7th began flying Boeing EC-135 aircraft. The EC-130E ABCCC consisted of seven aircraft. The EC-130E is a modified C-130 Hercules; aircraft designed to carry the AN/USC-48 Airborne Battlefield Command and Control Center Capsules (ABCCC III). While functioning as a direct extension of ground-based command and control authorities, the primary mission was to provide flexibility in the overall control of tactical air resources. In addition, to maintain positive control of air operations, ABCCC provided communications to higher headquarters, including national command authorities, in both peace and wartime environments. The ABCCC provided unified and theater commanders the capability for combat operations during war, contingencies, exercises, and other missions. A highly trained force of mission ready crew members and specially equipped EC-130E aircraft to support worldwide combat operations. Mission roles include airborne extensions of the Air Operations Center and Airborne Air Support Operations Center for command and control of offensive air support operations; and airborne on-scene command for special operations such as airdrops or evacuations. In September 2002, following 6+ years of continuous deployed operations (1994‚Äì2000) to Aviano Air Base supporting Operation Deny Flight, Operation Deliberate Force, Operation Decisive Edge, Operation Deliberate Guard, Operation Deliberate Forge and Operation Allied Force, the unit was inactivated. Some of the aircraft were retired, some assumed new rolesmissions for the U.S. Air Force. All of the capsules, save one, were scrapped. =Compass Call training= It was reactivated in 2006 as part of the Global War on Terror in order to provide training for EC-130H Compass Call squadrons at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. Since 2006, the 42nd has served as the 'schoolhouse' squadron for the 41st and 43d Electronic Combat Squadrons.

Caburus was granted Roman citizenship in 83 BC by Gaius Valerius Flaccus during his governorship of Gaul.Julius Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 1.47.4. The date of his last known activity indicates that he was probably between the ages of twenty and thirty at the time, and almost certainly under thirty-five. Caburus took his patron's gentilic name, as was customary for naturalized citizens. It was exceedingly rare in the early 1st century BC for an ethnic Celt born outside the Italian peninsula to hold Roman citizenship. Caburus's service must have been of great value during a politically turbulent time; see discussion of Flaccus's governorship and his position during the civil wars of the 80s. Caburus's loyalty to Rome was long-lived, as was his prominence among his people. During the 50s BC, he actively supported Julius Caesar in the Gallic Wars. He last appears in the historical record in 52 BC as a leader of the Helvii, more than thirty years after becoming a Roman citizen. This longevity, coupled with the rare grant of citizenship, suggests that Caburus was a person of exceptional political acuity and leadership qualities. Caburus had two known sons, Troucillus (or Procillus), who played a diplomatic role on Caesar's staff in 58 BC, and Domnotaurus (in Celtic probably Donnotarvos), who died while defending Helvian territory against a force of Arverni and Gabali sent by Vercingetorix.Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 1.19, 1.47, 1.53, 7.8, 7.65; Ronald Syme, The Provincial at Rome (University of Exeter Press, 1999), p. 65 online; Ramsay MacMullen, Romanization in the Time of Augustus (Yale University Press, 2000), p. 99 online and pp. 166‚Äì167, note 48.

Although she had been based in Germany, in 1939 at the start of World War II she took refuge in Denmark with her Danish husband, but then in 1943, they again became refugees, this time to Sweden. Many of her novels have been adapted into movies and all have been translated into numerous languages.

Along with the Burke and Wills monument, the statue is one of only two free standing art works in the City Square precinct.Williams, Linda., 'Reshaping Melbourne (Part 1)', Art and Australia, December 2000/January 2001, Vol. 38, No. 2 pp. 326‚Äì328 The statue now located in the square is the second statue of 'Larry', the original having been stolen. History Melbourne artist Pamela Irving created the statue as a result of a commission from the Melbourne City Council in 1992 and it was the first sculpture for Melbourne's Open Air Sculpture Museum.Keneally, S., Pamela Irving: Happy as Larry, CD-ROM, Susan Keneally and Pamela Irving, Melbourne 2008 Based on her own dog, Lucy, the statue is not representative of any particular breed but was crafted to generate a sense of Australian larrikinism in the viewer. Irving named the statue after her uncle Larry and the surname 'La Trobe' was appended to represent the relationship with Melbourne and the state of Victoria. Charles La Trobe was the first Lieutenant-Governor of the state of Victoria. Despite being anchored by 30 cm bolts, the statue was stolen on the night of 30/31 August 1995.Lunney, Darren., 'Come home Larry ‚Äì all is forgiven', Caulfield Leader, March 1996 It was thought to have been taken as part of a university stunt or melted down. A campaign was started by the Melbourne Times, a weekly city newspaper, to recover Larry.Lyon, Karen., 'Looking for lovable, lost Larry', Melbourne Times, March 1996 The publicity generated by this campaign captured the imagination of the public. A two-metre high likeness of Larry was created for the 1996 Moomba Parade to create additional publicity that might lead to the return of the statue. Although the subject of a significant publicity and media campaign, the original statue has never been recovered and nobody has been apprehended for the theft. In 1996, Peter Kolliner, previous owner of the foundry where Larry was originally cast, paid for a casting of a new statue.Lyon, Karen., 'Larry returns but this time he‚Äôs on a tight leash', Melbourne Times, August 1996 The new statue was cast in the same mould as the original but Irving reddened the casting material to provide the second 'Larry' with a unique identity. The second Larry was reinstalled in the City Square and officially unveiled on 16 September 1996 by Melbourne Lord Mayor, Councillor Ivan Deveson.Rados, Alen, 'Larry licked but never beaten', The Herald Sun, 17 September 1996 The two-metre high replica of the statue used in the Moomba Parade was taken to Osaka, Japan, a sister city of Melbourne, in 1997 for the Midosuji Parade, where it was awarded the prize for Best Float. Description The statue is approximately 70 cm high and cast from bronze. Although it has been likened to a 'dingo type dog', the model for the statue is a composite that does not represent any one breed in particular. Cultural events The image of Larry was one of the features of the 1999 Melbourne Comedy Festival. Ceramic sculptures of Larry in comedic parodies of famous international and Australian artists' works were displayed in the windows of Myer on Melbourne's Bourke Street Mall. A sculpture of 'Larry' riding Phar Lap and titled 'Phar Larry' was also created by Irving for the 1999 Melbourne Cup. Popularity The location, accessibility and popularity of the statue have resulted in it becoming one of Melbourne's most photographed statues.

Life Patrick O'Neill was born in Annaghmore, County Armagh, Ireland, in 1875. He married Mary (Minnie) McConville in 1903 in Portadown, County Armagh, and they moved to Warrenpoint, County Down, where he became the proprietor of the Victoria Hotel. They had five children: Mary Theresa (Molly), Harry Gerard, Bernard, Patrick, and Nora. Mary died (likely in childbirth) in 1911. In 1913, O'Neill married Brigid Smith in Moynalvey, County Meath, and they had four children: Brigid (Dolie), Jim, Teresa V. and Nuala. O'Neill and his family lived at the Crown Hotel in Warrenpoint, which he purchased in 1913. He died in 1938 in Warrenpoint. Political career In his early political career, O'Neill served as Chairman of the Warrenpoint Urban District Council, as well as Justice of the Peace, for a number of years. He was appointed as the presiding officer at the Warrenpoint Town Hall polling station during the 1918 general election in Ireland, and then in 1920, he ran unsuccessfully in the election for County Councilors for the County Down constituency. That year, the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 was introduced to establish the partition of Ireland and create two devolved parliaments within the UK. O'Neill was elected to the newly formed Parliament of Northern Ireland as a nationalist MP for the Down constituency in the 1921 Northern Ireland general election. Partition, which had created a northern Catholic and nationalist majority in a primarily Protestant and Unionist state, was a key issue in this election. To protest the fact that Northern Ireland was established to have a Unionist majority, the Nationalist party members, including O'Neill, abstained from taking their seats during the first parliament. O'Neill was re-elected in the 1925 election, and in early 1926 decided to enter parliament after it was decided at a convention in his constituency that it was no longer useful for the nationalist MPs to abstain. In 1928, he was elected as a joint honorary secretary of the newly formed National League of the North. He sat in the Northern parliament for County Down until 1929 when the Unionist government eliminated proportional representation. At the 1929 Northern Ireland general election, he was elected for the Mourne constituency and was re-elected in 1933. He was spokesman of the Irish Nationalist Party on financial matters. O'Neill sat for the Mourne division until his retirement in 1938. Archives A selection of the personal and political archives of Patrick O'Neill have been preserved by the Public Record Office of Northern Irelandhttp://www.proni.gov.uk/index_to_political_papers.pdf and the University of St. Michael's College at the University of Toronto. The fonds ranges between 1875-1998, with the majority of the material from 1918-1938.

Birth and Name  Paullus Fabius Persicus is believed to have been born in 2 or 1 BCE.Ronald Syme, Augustan Aristocracy (1989), p. 416 His cognomen - like the praenomen (Paullus) he shared with his father - was given to him to advertise his natural paternal descent from Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus, who had defeated the last Macedonian monarch, Perseus, in 146 BCE.  Life and career  The first appearance of Persicus is in June of the year 15, when he was co-opted into the Arval Brethren aged c. 15 to replace his then recently deceased father. Around the same time, he was also made a member of the College of Pontiffs and of the Sodales Augustales. He subsequently held the posts of quaestor under Tiberius and praetor, though the details of these posts are unknown.Braund, D., Augustus to Nero: A Sourcebook on Roman History, 31BC-AD68 (1985), pp. 213-5 His next dated post is in 34, when he became ordinary consul with Lucius Vitellius, the father of the later Roman Emperor Vitellius, as his colleague.Alison E.

It is based on the Chinese folk legend Legend of the White Snake. First shown on Taiwan Television in 1992, the series was broadcast on China Central Television in 1993 and became a major hit. It remained popular for more than 20 years, and was still one of the most replayed TV series in 2016. Plot After hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years of disciplined training in Taoism whilst living in a cave on Mount Emei, the protagonist Bai Su Zhen (Pure White Silk) has, with the help of a heavenly immortality pill, transformed herself from her true original form as a snake into a human form to seek immortality in the human world in her quest for divinity, guided by the Mother of Mercy, Guan Yin (lit. \\"Watcher of the World's Cry\\") She then meets and masters in single combat her would be ravisher. He then transforms himself into a female form and becomes her aide de camp. He is known as Xiao Qing (\\"Small Green\\") and like Bai had originally been a serpent. Bai at some point had been saved from being killed for her snake gall by a young cow-herd known to her only as her benefactor. One of her reasons to enter the human world was to repay him. Guan Yin had told him he would meet a higher man on Tomb Sweeping Day at the West Lake. Whether higher was meant literally or metaphorically was uncertain. Bai and Xiao Qing together search for this benefactor. Bai finds him and it is love at first sight. They meet on the Broken Bridge on Tomb Sweeping Day. Hanwen is there to visit the grave of his deceased parents. In this life Hanwen works in a pharmacy and studies medicine. Because Hanwen had saved Bai in her previous life when she was a snake she wishes to repay him. The two fall in love, marry, have a child, and are pursued all along the way by a religious zealot, Fa Hai. Fa Hai believes that a demon is always a demon and can never become good and belongs not in the human world hence his dogged pursuit. Bai has a child with Hanwen after their marriage. To save that child she agrees to be imprisoned in Lei Feng Pagoda (which literally means thundering wind tower), a symbol of the tomb. The series is operatic in the huang mei style. This opera form was originated by women tea pickers. It is a popular not elite art form. This may explain the role of gender in the legend. The legend certainly traces the development and conflicts within Chinese theology, from primitive snake cults through taoism and buddhism. In whatever form, this legend calls forth for compassion toward those lower who seek self-improvement, and exhorts all to self-improvement.

The girls were the first female innovators of the feet-to-feet catching technique. Early life Third- generation Italian Canadians, Karyne and Sarah Steben grew up becoming skillful at gymnastics, trampoline, dance and theater. At the age of six, they signed to do a television series Les Satellipopettes in Quebec with their father Claude Steben, the show's host. Their travels began during these early years, when they visited more than 22 countries, learned to speak French, German, English and Spanish, and participated in festivals in Sweden, Italy, France and Russia. Career Their skill and unique talents led Karyne and Sarah to create an original and innovative act at the 1992 Cirque de Demain Festival in Paris, France. It won them their first gold medal. The girls joined Cirque du Soleil as the featured trapeze act in Saltimbanco, and toured the United States and Canada with the production for two years. Following the tour, the twins played the prestigious Tigerpalast cabaret in Frankfurt, Germany; won a Gold Ring Award at the First International Festival of Circus in Geneva, Italy, and received the YTV Achievement Award, honoring Canadian youth and excellence. Then came a feature role in the Patricia Rozema film, When Night Is Falling, starring Pascale Bussi√®res. In October 1995, Karyne and Sarah rejoined Cirque du Soleil for the European tour of Saltimbanco and three months later performed in the prestigious International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo, hosted by Monaco's Rainier III, Prince of Monaco. Here they accepted the Silver Crown Award. Only months later they presented their act at the G-7 Summit, for an audience that included the heads of state of the world's seven richest countries. In 1998, they moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, to perform in Cirque du Soleil's water-themed production, O, at the Bellagio Hotel. Following Vegas, Karyne and Sarah traveled to Italy to act and dance in a European TV special for Rai Uno, hosted by Adriano Celentano. Since their return to the United States and their arrival in Los Angeles in 2000, Karyne and Sarah have participated in the creation of Madonna's 2001 Drowned World Tour, and were featured in several commercials and a variety of music videos, including working with Aerosmith.

It was officially dedicated on July 4, 1976, as a part of the American national bicentennial, and consists of a complex of buildings housing various items demonstrating the everyday life of the plains settlers, along with agricultural history. Facilities The main center for the museum is the Plainsman Building which holds the bulk of the museum's collections. Inside are a replica sod house and log cabin, along with a reproduction miniaturized Main Street where visitors can look upon late 19th and early 20th century life. Shops include a hardware store, a doctor's office, a town jail, a bar and a bank. Also within this building are further collections of local as well as historic interest. The Agricultural Building, located directly behind the Plainsman Building to the east was built in 1986 and houses an actual homestead, around which the building was constructed. It includes a large collection of farm machinery including horse-drawn implements such as plows and threshers, an early steam-powered tractor, various tractors leading from the 1920s into the present day and a collection of vintage automobiles from the 1920s and 30s. The Fairview School, a one-room schoolhouse, was moved to the museum in 1981 and displays authentic 19th century educational tools and desks. It, too, is located behind the Plainsman Building. A 19th century home sits across from the Fairview School, called the Bates House. It is dedicated to its former resident, Gen. Delevan Bates a Medal of Honor winner of the American Civil War, and his wife Lana. The Bates were instrumental in the establishment of Hamilton County, NE. The home was moved to the museum grounds in 1993. A blacksmith shop,also moved to the property, serves as a demonstration place during events and school trips. Most recently, a retired Burlington Northern Railroad caboose was moved to the property and is undergoing restoration.

Rick was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan and moved to Grand Rapids shortly thereafter. He began his radio career while still in high school at Union High School in Grand Rapids at WZZM-FM in 1970, where he worked part-time on weekends. His career started as a result of his involvement in a Junior Achievement program called HERO. Shortly after his graduation from high school in 1972, Rick was fired from WZZM. He moved on to WLAV and worked there until early 1973. He then received his first full-time job at WGTO-AM 540 (now WFLF (AM)) in Cypress Gardens, Florida. Beckett returned to WZZM-FM in 1976, which by this time became WZZR-FM (now WLHT). He worked evenings for the majority of his time there but eventually worked the afternoon drive. Beckett was fired from WZZR in 1980 and moved on to do radio at WAAY-AM (now WLOR) in Huntsville, Alabama. He was fired from WAAY in mid-1984 and returned to Cypress Gardens to work at WZNG-AM (now WHNR). He was also fired from WZNG. Beckett eventually returned to Grand Rapids and began a stint at WKLQ on their \\"Q Morning Zoo\\" program in 1987.

The film includes music from U2's 2009 studio album, No Line on the Horizon, and was included on both digital and DVD formats with several editions of the album. Development The idea behind the film originated from a U2 video shoot in June 2007. During the shoot, Corbijn asked the band to remain still while he filmed them; this created a \\"photograph on film\\", in which U2 did not move but the objects around them did. Impressed, the band believed that the listening experience could be enhanced with visuals, and in May 2008 they commissioned Corbijn to create the film. The film was created as a companion to No Line on the Horizon, and Corbijn has claimed that the film is not a music video, but rather \\"a new way to listen to a record\\" and \\"a new way to use film to connect to music\\". The plot is based on the characters Bono created for the album No Line on the Horizon, with the story revolving around a Parisian motorcycle cop who has become disillusioned with his life, as well as the conflict between immigrants and the police in the city, causing him to leave and see his girlfriend in Tripoli. The film features a mix of black-and-white and colour filming, and runs for 58:20. Linear was completed in time for the album's original November 2008 release date, but as the band continued to work into December the film became out of sequence with the album. 10 of the 11 songs in the film were edited as a solution, and the original running order was kept intact. The film features Sa√Ød Taghmaoui as the cop, Lizzie Brocher√© as the waitress, Marta Barrio as the lone dancer, and Francisco Javier Malia Vazquez as the barman. Plot The Parisian cop (Taghmaoui) prepares to cross the Mediterranean Sea to get to Tripoli (\\"Cedars of Lebanon\\"). The film opens with a scene of Paris as night falls, before moving on to a journey through the city streets (\\"Unknown Caller\\"). At the end of the trip through Paris, a motorcycle cop (Taghmaoui) sits on his police-issued motorcycle, staring at some graffiti on a wall which reads \\"Fuck the Police\\" in French. Kicking his bike over, he pours gasoline on it, sets it alight, and watches it burn (\\"Breathe\\"). As dawn breaks, he gets on his own motorcycle and begins his journey through the French countryside before crossing into Spain, aiming to see his girlfriend in Tripoli (\\"Winter\\"). Pulling off for a break part-way through the journey, the cop lies on his back and watches a cloud form the image of the African continent before falling asleep (\\"White as Snow\\"). Waking up, he resumes his journey across Spain (\\"No Line on the Horizon\\"). Upon coming to a town, he pulls off for lunch and enters a small caf√© which, with the exception of the waitress (Brocher√©), is devoid of people (\\"Fez ‚Äì Being Born\\"). Bored, the waitress flicks on the television and they watch a U2 music video (\\"Magnificent\\"). Resuming his journey, the cop travels through the countryside until making a stop in C√°diz (\\"Stand Up Comedy\\"). Walking into a bar, the cop attracts the attention of a woman who begins to dance (Barrio), while the barman (Vazquez) serves him several drinks. Leaving the dancer his keys on the table, the cop goes to leave the bar, but as he does so he looks through a peephole and observes several women with moustaches dancing (\\"Get on Your Boots\\"). Walking alone through the streets and with no place to stay overnight, he makes his way down to the beach and falls asleep on the sand (\\"Moment of Surrender\\"). Waking up in the morning, he rents a rowboat and begins to paddle his way across the Mediterranean Sea to Tripoli (\\"Cedars of Lebanon\\"). Track listing The film contains 11 tracks, 10 of which are from No Line on the Horizon. The order of the songs was rearranged from the order of the album. \\"Winter\\", a track cut from No Line on the Horizon, is in the film while \\"I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight\\" is not. The film's running order is representative of No Line on the Horizons track list as of May 2008.

It is found in eastern Mexico from the Rio Grande to the Yucat√°n Peninsula, as well as in Belize and northern Guatemala. It prefers moist grassland habitat. While long thought to be a subspecies of S. hispidus, recent taxonomic revisions, based on mitochondrial DNA sequence data, have split the extensive former species range into three separate species. Carroll et al. (2004) indicate that the southern edge of the S. hispidus distribution is likely near the Rio Grande where it meets the northern distribution of S. toltecus (formerly S. h. toltecus). The range of S. toltecus extends from northern Mexico south into Chiapas where it occurs in sympatry with S. hirsutus (formerly S. h. hirsutus).

In the frame story, the 11th century king Bhoja discovers the throne of the legendary ancient king Vikramaditya (also known as Bikramjit). The throne has 32 statues, who are actually apsaras that had been turned into stone due to a curse. Each of the apsaras tells Bhoja a story about the life and adventures of Vikramaditya, in order to convince him that he is not deserving of Vikramaditya's throne. The original collection, written in Sanskrit, was known as Si·πÉhƒÅsana DvƒÅtri·πÉ≈õikƒÅ. Other titles for the collection include DvƒÅtri·πÉ≈õat PuttalikƒÅ (\\"Thirty-two Statue Stories\\"), VikrƒÅmaditya SimhƒÅsana DvƒÅtri·πÉ≈õika (\\"Thirty-two Tales of the Throne of Vikramaditya\\"), and Vikrama Charita (\\"Deeds or Adventures of Vikrama\\"). In modern vernaculars, the collection is known as Singhastan Battisi; other transliterations of the title include Sinhasan Battisi and Simhasan Battisi.  Plot  King Bhoja walks past a field of a Brahmin with the royal entourage who from a seat on a high mound overlooking his whole field invites the King to have a taste of the fresh produce of his field. On the King's approach to the Brahmin's field, he leaves his seat to shoo off the birds, following which he miserly opposes King's entry on his field and charges him with grave intrusion and violation of civilian rights which prompts the King to leave the field immediately. After shooing off the birds, the Brahmin returns to sit on the mound. He then again beseeches King Bhoja to return to the field and taste the produce. Again the same process is repeated which intrigues Bhoja as to how the behavior of the Brahmin changes whilst on the mound and on the plain. He learns that by just stepping on it, one's heart has all the magnanimous traits boosted and filled with love and justice. Bhoja's soldiers dig the mound to find a throne. The throne is identified as that of the ancient Emperor Vikramaditya, who was well-known and respected for being just. Bhoja's advisers tell him that he will also be able to pass the best judgements, once he sits on the throne. The throne is supported by 32 statues of Apsaras. When Bhoja sits on the throne, one of the statues comes to life, and explains to the king that simply sitting on the throne will not make him a great judge: there are other qualities that he lacks. The Apsara tells him one story related to one quality that a good judge must possess and flies away. In the same manner, one after another, the Apsaras tell a story related to a quality and fly away. Bhoja realizes that he does not possess the qualities that would make one eligible to sit on the throne. Some of these qualities are selflessness, complete honesty, lack of bias or favouritism and a true urge to give justice.  Authorship and date  The author and date of the original work is unknown. Since the story mentions Bhoja (died 1055 CE), it must have been composed in or after the 11th century.‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§Ç‡§∂‡§§‡•ç‡§™‡•Å‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§≤‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ: Sinhasan Battisi Five primary recensions of the Sanskrit version Simhasana-dvatrimsika are dated to 13th and 14th centuries. Khulasat-ut-Tawarikh (1695 CE) by Sujan Rai claims that the work had been authored by Pandit Braj, the wazir (prime minister) of Bhoja.  Translations  \`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni translated the stories into Persian for the Mughal emperor Akbar, as Nama - Khirad Afza (\\"Wisdom-enhancing book\\"). The translation was completed in 1581 CE. Other titles for the Persian translation include Gul Afshan and Senguehassen Battisi. Lallu Lal and Kazim Ali Javan translated it into Hindi. During 1814-15, William Carey published the Marathi translation under the title Simhasana Battisi, along with Panchatantra and Hitopadesha. The 17th century poet Shamal Bhatt had adapted these stories as narrative poetry. Franklin Edgerton translated it as \\"The Adventures of Vikrama\\" in four of its popular rescensions. It is sometimes published along with the Baital Pachisi. Koravi Goparaju translated it into Telugu language in 15th century as Simhasana Dwitrimsika. It was published by Andhra Sahitya Parishad, Kakinana in 1936 under the editorship of Vemparala Suryanarayana Sastry. Subsequently Andhra Pradesh Sahitya Akademi, Hyderabad published in one volume in 1982. The editor Gadiyaram Ramakrishna Sarma has written a detailed Foreword.  TV adaptations  A television adaptation of Singhasan Battisi was aired on Doordarshan in 1985. In 2014, another adaptation was aired on Sony Pal.

It is found in southern Chiapas in Mexico through Central America, except for Belize, and as far east as northern Colombia and Venezuela. It lives in tropical rainforest, dry forest and savanna, as well as in cultivated areas. The species is terrestrial and primarily diurnal. It was long thought to be a subspecies of S. hispidus. However, recent taxonomic revisions, based on mitochondrial DNA sequence data, have split the extensive former species range into three separate species. Carroll et al. (2004) indicate that the southern edge of the S. hispidus distribution is likely near the Rio Grande where it meets the northern distribution of S. toltecus (formerly S. h. toltecus). The range of S. toltecus extends from northern Mexico south into Chiapas where it occurs in sympatry with S. hirsutus (formerly S. h. hirsutus). Rats from this species group have been used as laboratory animals. References *Infonatura *Carroll, D. S., L. L. Peppers, and R. D. Bradley. 2004.

At present the genus contains the single species Paleopsephurus wilsoni. The genus is known primarily from the Late Cretaceous, Turonian to the Maastrichtian stage, Hell Creek Formation deposits. Paleopsephurus is one of only two known paddlefish genera to have been found in the North American fossil record, with the genus and species Crossopholis magnicaudatus only being described and found in the Early Eocene Green River Formation. A third extinct genus Protopsephurus with the single species Protopsephurus liui was described from China in 1994. Only two modern paddle fish species are known, Polyodon spathula in the Mississippi River System of North America, and the possibly extinct Psephurus gladius in the Yangtze River of China. History and classification The genus was described from three partial specimens currently residing in the collections of the University of Michigan Museum of Paleontology in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. Specimen number 22206 U.M. is a complete and well preserved skull with some denticles, pectoral girdle and pectoral fins. The second and third specimens were found in a block of matrix from the same location as 2226 U.M.. Specimen 22207 U.M. is a portion of the caudal region of a paddlefish, while 22208 U.M. is a partial shoulder with associated pectoral fin. While the specimens were found close to each other, it is impossible to determine if they represent a single individual, and as such were described as three separate fish specimens. The specimens were collected from a sandstone outcrop of the Hell Creek Formation southeast of Fort Peck, Montana by a University of Michigan Museum of Paleontology expedition in 1938. the fossils were in close association with the holotype specimen of the extinct sturgeon Protoscaphirhynchus squamosus. The Paleopsephurus specimens were first studied by American paleontologist and ichthyologist Archie Justus MacAlpin. He published his detailed 1947 type description in the journal Contributions from the Museum of Paleontology, University of Michigan.

The programme replaced the 3-2-2-3 system (three years of junior secondary school, two years of senior secondary school, two years of matriculation course and three years of university education). This scheme began in the 2009 school year. By 2012, HKDSE had replaced HKCEE (O Level) and HKALE (A Level).  Curriculum  Core subjects are Chinese language, English language, mathematics and liberal studies, along with three elective subjects. It is different from the old curriculum in that pupils now receive three years of senior secondary education and four years of university education. To move to university education, students must pass all four core subjects in the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education. As a result, there is no more need for a genuine sixth form college. The first and only such college in Hong Kong, PLK Vicwood KT Chong Sixth Form College, changed to being largely a senior secondary college.  Advantages  *The incorporation of Liberal Studies as a new core subject of the certificate, alongside Chinese, English and Mathematics), targeted to raise students' awareness of world issues and political matters, develop critical and logical reasoning, and experience research processes of data gathering, sifting and analysis through an independent research project, known as IES (Independent Enquiry Studies).  Disadvantages  *The change in format was an added burden for teachers and students in the transition cohorts. *Liberal Studies is a new subject, requiring additional training for teachers. *With the combination of the two public exams into one, there is no longer a first exam to act as a filter. The wide range in the competency among students makes designing the new papers becomes more difficult. *The exams, first sat in 2012, were considerably easier than internationally accepted exams such as the IB Diploma. Many often achieve high marks. Questions such as \\"Name five cities mentioned in the magazine article\\" appeared in the English exam. The history course has been criticised as too easy with 50% of the grade is based on data analysis, which requires little historical knowledge. Others claim that the data-based questions also require candidates to make use of their background knowledge to make sense of the data provided and to express views over controversial statements, as they do in answering the essay-type questions.

In 1878, he was involved in the Alexander T. Stewart bodysnatching case when he was contacted by the kidnappers to act as an intermediary between themselves and the Stewart estate. When negotiations stalled between the Stewart family's lawyer Henry Hilton, he assisted Stewart's widow in negotiating for the return of her husband's body.Lardner, James and Thomas Reppetto. NYPD: A City and Its Police. New York: Henry Holt & Co., 2000. (pg. 80-81) Jones also had a successful military career serving with the Union Army during the American Civil War, being involved in thirty major battles and countless skirmishes, and reaching the rank of brigadier general before the war's end. He was one of ten Irish-Americans to become brigade commanders and one of four Irish born officers to become a divisional commander.Mahin, Dean B. The Blessed Place of Freedom: Europeans in Civil War America. Dulles, Virginia: Brassey's Inc., 2003. (pg. 24-25, 225) BiographyEarly life and legal career= Born in County Westmeath, Ireland on November 20, 1830, Jones attended grammar school in Dublin for three years until emigrating with his family to the United States in 1840. They settled on a farm in Cattaraugus County, New York where Jones would spend most of his childhood. Because of his poor background, he received only a limited education at the Union School in Ellicottville. In 1850, the 20-year- old Jones became involved in journalism and traveled as a correspondent throughout the Western States for a leading New York journal. He later became the local editor for the Buffalo Republic and one of the editors of the Buffalo Sentinel.Harlow, S.R. and S.C. Hutchins. Life Sketches of State Officers, Senators, and Members of the Assembly of the State of New York in 1868. Albany: Weed, Parsons & Company, 1868. (pg. 55-58) Eventually, Jones decided to pursue a career in law and later studied under the firm of Addison Rice. He was admitted to the bar in 1856 and afterwards practiced law with Addison in Ellicottville \\"Obituary.

By 1860, he had established himself as one of the most prominent lawyers in western New York. A lifelong Democrat, he became disillusioned by the party's support of Southern succession from the Union and, in May 1861, decided to join the military in defense of the United States.New York Republican Party. The Union State Ticket: Personal Character and Military Services. Gallantry Which, Under The First Napoleon, Would Have Made French Marshals. New York: Baker & Godwin Printers, 1865. (pg. 19-21) =Military service= Upon the outbreak of the American Civil War, Jones readily joined the Union Army. On July 7, 1861, he enlisted with the 37th New York Volunteers, popularly known as the \\"Irish Rifles\\", under Colonel John H. McCunn. He was initially a private but quickly found himself elected to the rank of second lieutenant by the men in the regiment. He was present at the First Battle of Bull Run, only two weeks after his enlistment, but saw no action as the unit was held in reserve. Jones displayed \\"gallant conduct\\" during his first years with the regiment and soon rose in rank to first lieutenant and adjutant on November 4, 1861, and then major on January 21, 1862.Eicher, John H. and David J. Eicher. Civil War High Commands. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2001. (pg. 324) He and the \\"Irish Rifles\\" later joined General Samuel P. Heintzelman's III Corps, as part of the 3rd Brigade of the 3rd Division under Brigadier General Philip Kearny, during the Peninsula campaign and participated in Williamsburg, Seven Pines and the Seven Days campaign. Jones was also present when the 37th New York Volunteers, then attached to the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Division of the III Corps, were at the Second Battle of Bull Run. In May and June, he began suffering from malaria and was hospitalized in Washington, D.C. on September 26 remaining there until the end of October.Welsh, Jack D. Medical Histories of Union Generals. Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 2005. (pg. 184-185) He was also briefly an officer to Major General Franz Sigel prior to the retirement of General Ambrose Burnside and the reorganization of the Army of the Potomac. On October 8, 1862, Jones was promoted to the rank of colonel and transferred to the 154th New York Volunteers, or the \\"Hardtack regiment\\", then under command by his former law partner Colonel Addison Rice. Rice had founded the regiment and, within two months of its arrival in Northern Virginia, he turned over his command to Jones.Dunkelman, Mark H. War's Relentless Hand: Twelve Tales of Civil War Soldiers. Baton Rouge: Louisiana University Press, 2006. (pg. 24-25) The 154th was part of General Oliver O. Howard's XI Corps during the Battle of Chancellorsville, attached to the 1st Brigade of the 2nd Division commanded by Brigadier General Adolph von Steinwehr, where Jones was wounded in the right hip when his unit was ambushed and overrun by Confederate troops under Thomas \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson resulting in his capture. Jones remained a prisoner-of-war for five months until being released in a prisoner exchange in October 1863; other accounts claim he was paroled for medical reasons on May 15 and again hospitalized in Washington during June where had an attack of amaurosis two months later. After his release from hospital in Annapolis, Maryland, Jones was placed in charge of paroled prisoners before returning to active duty and accompanied the XI Corps upon being transferred to Tennessee. The unit was present at Chattanooga during the assault on Missionary Ridge the next month, however they did not participate in the battle. In April 1864, Jones took a brief leave of absence to recover his health. When the XI and XII Corps were combined to form the Major General William T. Sherman's XX Corps during that spring, although still in poor health, Jones accepted command of the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division (\\"Geary's White Stars\\") during the Atlanta campaign, the March to the Sea and the Carolinas campaign. On May 8, he was seriously injured in a skirmish at Buzzard's Roost (Mill Creek Gap) when his horse fell off a cliff during the Battle of Rocky Face Ridge. He was cleared to return to duty a month later, however his surgeon recommended \\"a change of climate and mode of living\\" allowing Jones to take another sick leave in December. He resumed his command during the final weeks of the campaign and was present at the surrender of Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston in March 1865. On April 18, Jones accepted a commission as brigadier-general on the personal recommendations of Generals Joseph \\"Fighting Joe\\" Hooker and Oliver Howard. President Abraham Lincoln telegraphed General Sherman to inquire about their requests to which Sherman praised his \\"gallant services in the field\\" during the campaign. Rejoining his old unit at Goldsboro, North Carolina, he remained at that rank for the rest of the war and resigned on June 17, 1865. =Stewart bodysnatching case= After his resignation, Jones resumed his law practice in Ellicottville and in November 1865 was elected on the Republican ticket as Clerk of the New York Court of Appeals. He remained in this office until December 31, 1868. On August 13, 1868, Jones was appointed by Gov. Reuben E. Fenton as Register of New York City (the local recorder of deeds) to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Charles G. Halpine, remaining in this office until the end of the year with the understanding that the fees of the office be paid over to Halpine's widow.Appointment of Register of the City of New- York In Place of the Late Gen. Halpine in NYT on August 14, 1868 On April 1, 1869, Jones was appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant as Postmaster of New York City and was eventually succeeded by Thomas L. James upon his resignation in 1872. From 1875 to 1877, Jones was again Register of New York City, elected in November 1874 on the Republican ticket. Afterwards he resumed his private practice. In January 1877, Jones was contacted by Henry G. Romaine requesting that he act as an intermediary between himself and the Stewart estate. Romaine had been involved in stealing the body of Alexander T. Stewart three months earlier and was demanding a ransom from his widow Cornelia. In several signed letters to Jones, Romaine offered the return of Stewart's body for $250,000 and was instructed to contact him through personal ads in the New York Herald. He also received a small packet, express delivered from Canada, which included the knobs and two of the silver handles from Stewart's casket as well as a small strip of velvet and triangular piece of paper. Jones immediately reported the incident to the NYPD Chief of Police George W. Walling and, after a meeting with Walling and Henry Hilton, Jones agreed to proceed in the negotiations.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 203-204) Walling, George W. Recollections of a New York Chief of Police: An Official Record of Thirty-eight Years as Patrolman, Detective, Captain, Inspector and Chief of the New York Police. New York: Caxton Book Concern, 1887. (pg. 230-234) On February 5, Jones placed a personal ad offering to open negotiations. A letter was sent six days later, postmarked Boston, in which Romaine offered the return of Stewart's body on several conditions which included payment of $250,000 in cash, that the body would be delivered to an arranged spot 25 miles from Montreal, Quebec, Canada only to Jones and Hilton, Jones would hold the money to turn it over to a representative and for \\"both parties to maintain forever an unbroken silence in regard to the transaction\\". Hilton refused to agree to these terms and broke off negotiations. Jones was then told to deliver these demands to Stewart's widow himself, but Jones refused to participate any further. A year later, after further negotiations by Hilton had failed, Jones was approached by Stewart's widow to negotiate on her behalf. Romaine agreed to return the body for $100,000 and, while the distraught widow favored to accept the offer, Jones persuaded her to allow him to continue negotiations and was eventually able to get Romaine to accept an offer of $20,000. He later oversaw the delivery of the ransom money as well as the return of the body in Westchester County, New York. =Later years= Jones suffered serious medical problems in his old age, specifically deafness and chronic diarrhea, which his physician blamed on his exposure to artillery fire and his time in the swamps along the Chickahominy River during his military service. He also suffered from constant pain in his right sciatic nerve, attributed to his old war wound suffered at Chancellorsville, as well as his wound in the gluteal region. Almost every spring and fall, he suffered from chills and fever lasting a week or two and confined him to bed. He also had occasional episodes of jaundice for which he took calomel, citrus of magnesia and an unknown type of Indian medicine. In October 1886, a medical examination showed that the scar where the bullet had entered, located two inches below the trochanter major, was the \\"size of a ten-cent piece\\" while the exit wound four inches back and two inches below the first scar. His liver and spleen were both enlarged by percussion, his skin looked anemic, the conjunctiva of his eyes were yellowish, and had suffered considerable weight loss. His condition had worsened after another examination in August 1898 and his health continued to decline over the next two years. In early-July 1900, Jones began suffering from severe gastroenteritis. His condition did not respond to therapeutic treatments as he lost control of his bowels and was unable to keep down solid food, living on scalded milk and brandy. On July 18, 1900, Jones died from cardiac failure, indirectly caused by his gastroenteritis, at his home in Port Richmond, New York. His funeral was held at St. Mary's Church two days later and then buried in St. Peter's Cemetery. See also *List of American Civil War generals (Union) ReferencesFurther reading * Dunkelman, Mark H.

It was home to several powered and unpowered campsites, several BBQ areas, 2 boat launches, a beach, several rent-able cabins, a miniature golf course and other services.

Alfonso's heir from May 1107, he eventually co-ruled from Toledo. He predeceased his father, being killed while trying to escape the field of the Battle of Ucl√©s. His death, on his first recorded military expedition, precipitated a succession crisis that ended with the accession of his elder half-sister Urraca and her husband, Alfonso the Battler, already King of Navarre and Aragon, to the throne of Kingdom of Castile-Le√≥n. Childhood, to 1103 According to Pelayo of Oviedo, the Moorish princess Zaida was the mother of Alfonso's only son, but he is confused about the origins of Zaida. She was married to Fath al-Mamun, the ruler of the taifa of C√≥rdoba, and thus a daughter-in-law (and not a daughter, as Pelayo believed) of al-Mutamid of Seville.Reilly 1988, 234. Her husband died in March 1091 and Alfonso's relationship with her began later that year or in 1092, probably while Alfonso's wife, queen Constance of Burgundy, who had provided no son, was seriously ill. Constance died in Autumn 1093. It is probable on chronological grounds that Zaida became pregnant with the infante in late 1092 or early 1093,Reilly 1988, 235, 240, where he favors the latter year. The Chronicon regum Legionensium refers to Zaida as \\"the daughter of King Abenabeth of Seville, who was baptised ... Elisabeth\\" and the second concubine of Alfonso VI, calling Sancho their son. or for legalistic grounds, after the death of Constance and before Alfonso's 1095 remarriage to Bertha.Salazar y Acha 1992, 322, suggesting 1094. The argument is that an illegitimate heir would have been unacceptable if conceived in adultery, but not if simply in fornication. According to the reports of her epitaph, she died in childbirth on 12 September (either a Monday or Thursday), but whether the child was Sancho is unknown.This cannot be assumed to be Sancho's birth, particularly in light of scholarly speculation that the later queen Isabel is identical to Zaida, e.g. Salazar y Acha 1992 and Salazar y Acha 2007. Of the two weekdays based on alternative transcripts of Zaida's epitaph, a Monday would fit with the theorized 1093 birth of Sancho, while Thursday could place her death in 1107 when Queen Isabel disappears from the records. Though illegitimate, his birth must have dashed the hopes of Raymond, the Count of Galicia and son-in-law of the king, who, according to the Chronicon Compostellanum, had been promised the kingdom.Reilly 1988, 248. There exists a charter of a grant made to the church at Le√≥n dated 17 January 1098 which lists the young Sancho as a witness, but it is a forgery.Reilly 1988, 289. A document mentioning Sancho from 22 April 1099 is also a forgery, cf. Reilly 1988, 271n. Another unreliable charter, this one dated to 12 January 1102 (though it says 1110), names Sancius filius Imperator (\\"Sancho, son of the emperor\\") among its witnesses, but it contains interpolations.Reilly 1988, 309-10n. Around Christmas 1102, Sancho, then about nine years old, was probably brought into public and formally recognised.Reilly 1988, 333, argues that this age was typical for a boy of the time to leave the tutelage of women for more masculine influences. The recognition of Sancho, which would have marked him as a potential heir, was probably supported by the powerful Leonese magnate Pedro Ans√∫rez, who was shortly to be exiled until after the infante's death, probably because his position with respect to the young Sancho had earned him the enmity of Count Raymond and Henry, Count of Portugal, both aspirants to the throne.Reilly 1988, 333. In April 1103 Pope Paschal II sent a letter to the bishoprics of Mondo√±edo, Santiago de Compostela, Astorga, and Coimbra admonishing them to respect the metropolitancy of Braga, after the pope had received a complaint from the Archbishop Gerald. Also in 1103 bishop Gonzalo of Mondo√±edo appealed a judgement of Bernard de Sedirac, Archbishop of Toledo, to the pope. Probably these acts of defiance of metropolitan of Toledo, who laid claim to Coimbra and the primacy of Spain, were encouraged by counts Henry and Raymond. Early public life, 1103-1107 In early January 1103 a church council was held in the royal presence at Carri√≥n de los Condes to mediate a land dispute between Santiago de Compostela and Mondo√±edo. Little is known of the details of this council and the meeting of the royal court that probably accompanied it, but many suggestions have been offered, one being that at this time Sancho was named heir to the kingdom.Reilly 1988, 313, citing Torquato de Sousa Soares (1974), \\"O governo de Portugal pelo Conde Henrique de Borgonha: Sus rela√ß√µes com as monarquias Leonesa-Castelhana e Aragonesa,\\" Revista Portuguesa de Hist√≥ria, 14:378. The first public appearance of the young infante was at Sahag√∫n shortly after. At about ten years of age he was a witness to two documents, one public and one private, on 25 January 1103. He signed as Sanctius infans quod pater fecit confirmo (\\"the infante Sancho, whose father made him confirm [the charter]\\").Reilly 1988, 314. He thereafter figures more and more in royal charters.He confirmed thirteen of sixteen charters between his first public appearance and his death, and eight in the year 1103 alone, cf. Reilly 1988, 333. Sancho confirmed those of 10 and 25 February, also at Sahag√∫n, and also a grant of 19 March to San Salvador de O√±a, probably from Castile.This charter is dated to 23 March 1103 by Juan del √Ålamo (Salazar y Acha 1992, 321). Sancius infans Toletani imperatoris filius (\\"the infante Sancho of Toledo, son of the emperor\\") witnessed the donation of Adefonsus totius Ispanie imperator (\\"Alfonso, emperor of all Spain\\") with the consent of uxoris mee Helisabet regine (\\"my [Alfonso's] wife, queen Elisabeth [Isabel]\\"). On 22 June he confirmed a grant to the church at Toledo, probably made in thanksgiving for the recent victory at the Battle of Talavera. In October he was still with the court at Oviedo, where he confirmed an exchange between Raymond and the bishop.Reilly 1988, 316-17. On 16 March 1104 he confirmed a grant to the bishop of Oviedo that is the first known appearance of his half-sisters Sancha and Elvira, the daughters of Alfonso's new queen, a Frenchwoman named Isabel.Reilly 1988, 318. On 5 January 1105 a large group of Portuguese magnates, along with their count and countess, Henry and Theresa, met at Sahag√∫n and made a donation of some Portuguese lands to the Abbey of Cluny and that of San Isidro de Due√±as. Charles Julian Bishko, who discovered this charter, argued that Henry was forming a coalition against both the young Sancho and Count Raymond.Reilly 1988, 320. This, however, presumes the absence of Alfonso from his own court. At Sahag√∫n on 31 March 1105 Alfonso made a grant to the cathedral of Astorga, witnessed by Sancho and Raymond.Reilly 1988, 321. Sancho does not reappear until 19 March 1106, when he confirmed his father's grant to the church of Oviedo, made at Sahag√∫n, the court's favourite resting place.Reilly 1988, 322. He then confirmed a private charter at Sahag√∫n on 18 January 1107. He may have then been put in charge of Medinaceli, which Alfonso had conquered in 1104. From 23 April 1107 a private document of San Salvador de O√±a reads regnante rege adefonso in toleto et in leione et in omni regno yspanio. Santius filius. eius in Medina (\\"king Alfonso reigning in Toledo and in Le√≥n and in the entire Spanish kingdom. Sancho, his son, [reigning] in Medinaceli\\").Reilly 1982, 39. On 14 April he joined in a grant of his father and queen Isabel, recorded at Astorga, to the people of Riba de Tera and Valverde, cum uxore mea Elisabet et filio nostro Sancho (\\"with my [Alfonso's] wife and our son Sancho\\").Salazar y Acha 2007, 241. The use of the collective pronown, \\"our\\" son, has been used by Salazar y Acha to support the hypothesis that queen Isabel was identical to Sancho's mother, Zaida, baptised Isabel. Responsibility and death, 1107-1108 At Le√≥n in early May 1107 Alfonso held a great court at which he declared Sancho his heir.Reilly 1988, 324. On 14 May Alfonso's granted the right of coinage to the bishop of Santiago de Compostela and the grant was confirmed by Sancho, who for the first time signed as regnum electus patri factum (\\"made king-elect by his father\\"). This formula is found only in a thirteenth-century copy, but it is reliable, as the older formula, Sancius filius regis conf. (\\"Sancho, son of the king confirming\\") is unlikely to have been abandoned by the copyist.Reilly 1988, 325. Claudio S√°nchez-Albornoz, followed by Bishko, redated the charter to 1105 on the basis of the Historia Compostelana, a date which would lend support to the theory of a pacto sucess√≥rio (pact of succession) between Henry and Raymond in the spring of that year.Reilly 1988, 325 n104. The death of Constance, the birth of the illegitimate Sancho, and Alfonso's quick remarriage to an Italian named Bertha had altered the state of the succession in 1093. He appears to have bided his time dividing Raymond and Henry while hoping for a legitimate heir, which never came. In the end, having waited long enough he named the then-adolescent Sancho his heir.Reilly 1988, 328. On 27 May 1107 Raymond died. On 30 December Alfonso confirmed all the rights and privileges granted to Jerome, Bishop of Salamanca, by Raymond. Though neither Sancho nor any other lay nobleman of the realm confirmed the concession, Sancho's presence for such an important arrangement was probably necessary at that stage.Reilly 1988, 343. According to the Historia Compostelana, Sancho had been put in charge of Toledo by his father, probably at the December 1107 court at Le√≥n. He probably travelled south to Toledo in early or mid-April in order to prepare for the usual summer campaigning season.Reilly 1988, 349. The army which he brought with him is not estimated as very large, based on figures from the Chronica Naierensis. In May 1108 a large army of Moors united and attacked Ucl√©s, which they took on 27 May, forcing the garrison back into the alc√°zar (citadel). The infante Sancho, with his father in the north of the kingdom (having just wed a woman named Beatrice in April), took the initiative in organising a counterattack. The result was the Battle of Ucl√©s, in which the Christians were surrounded and slaughtered, though Sancho and his bodyguard of retainers managed to escape the m√™l√©e. He fled on horseback to Belinch√≥n, twenty kilometres northwest, but the local Muslims rose against him and he was killed.Reilly 1988, 350. Garc√≠a √Ålvarez, Alfonso's alf√©rez from 1100 to 1107 and Sancho's appointed guardian may be the Garc√≠a who according to Rodrigo Jim√©nez's De rebus Hispaniae was cut down while defending the infante.Reilly 1988, 224. He died without issue. NotesReferences *Reilly, Bernard F. 1982. The Kingdom of Le√≥n-Castilla under Queen Urraca, 1109-1126\\\\. Princeton: Princeton University Press. *Reilly, Bernard F. 1988.

The was the largest command structure for the . History It was composed of Army Group H, which was based in the Netherlands under Generaloberst Kurt Student, Army Group B, covering northern France under Field Marshal Erwin Rommel and Army Group G, which was based in southern France under the command of Generaloberst Johannes Blaskowitz. Also included was the Panzer Group West, under the command of General der Panzertruppe Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg. Most of Westheer's divisions were static infantry divisions, which did not have their own organic transport to move their own artillery. They were also laden with Ost battalions, which were made up of Russian POWs who had chosen to serve in the Wehrmacht. The leadership was also divided how to meet the invasion. Rommel, who commanded the expected landing areas, insisted that the panzer divisions should be near the coast, where they could quickly act without much interference. Rundstedt and von Schweppenburg suggested that they should be kept inland, to outmaneuver the enemy in battle. Thus, they were unsure on what to do in D-day. Despite that, the Westheer had 10 Heer and Waffen SS panzer and panzergrenadier divisions, besides some veteran infantry divisions of the Eastern Front which were currently refitting in France at D-day. At D-day, the Westheer had around 58 divisions organized into four armies. It was commanded by Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt at the time of Operation Overlord. Hitler's refusal to release the armored reserve until 1430 hours on D-day prevented the Germans from eliminating the allied beachheads while they were lightly held. Thus, the Westheer was embroiled in a battle of attrition which it could not win. Particularly difficult was the surrounding bocage of the Norman countryside, which seriously hampered armored operations and the allied bombing, which prevented the Germans from receiving reinforcements in strength. After Operation Cobra, the Westheer's order of battle was decimated by the destruction of the Falaise pocket, which consisted primarily of Army Group B. Although the Westheer regrouped after Falaise to fight in the Battle of Hurtgen Forest and Battle of the Bulge, it never exhibited the strength that they had in the summer of 1944. Most of its divisions at that time were understrength in personnel and equipment. The remnants of the Westheer disintegrated after the American breakthrough in the Battle of Remagen. Most units of the Westheer surrendered in the last weeks of World War II, especially at the Ruhr Pocket.

It struck the Central Valley of the country, destroying the cities of Concepci√≥n, Chill√°n, Cauquenes, Curic√≥ and Talca,Cr√≥nica de la Araucania: Descubrimiento i conquista, pacificaci√≥n definitiva, Horacio LaraHistoria General de Chile, Diego Barros Arana probably on May 24, 1751, although there is currently a debate among scholars as to the exact date of the earthquake (see also \\"Other dates\\"). Background The city of Concepci√≥n had already been hit by several earthquakes. On this occasion the city was still in the process of recovering from the earthquake and tsunami that completely destroyed the city in 1730. Hours before the earthquake, on the night of May 23, there were several tremors. This had caused some Concepci√≥n residents, accustomed to earthquakes, to prepare for the worst. Development The disaster was composed of two parts: the earthquake itself, and a series of tsunamis some 10 to 40 minutes later. = Earthquake = The earthquake began around one o'clock in the morning. According to one chronicle of a resident of Valpara√≠so and another of a resident of Concepci√≥n, the quake lasted about six minutes, although in Valpara√≠so there was no major damage recorded. During the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami, all of the buildings in the city of Concepci√≥n were destroyed. The records indicate that the earthquake was so intense that \\"the residents could not remain standing.\\" The earthquake was felt in the rest of the Chilean Central Valley, but with less intensity. One of the most affected cities near Concepci√≥n was Chill√°n, where the entire city was destroyed and the river changed its course, ending up nearly 15 blocks from its original location. In Santiago, the tower of the cathedral was destroyed by the tremor, although no other major damage was reported in the rest of the city.  Tsunami  Between 1:05 and 1:45, the sea receded more than 1 km, and then three to five tsunami waves struck land. The height and force of each wave increased, and the last was the most disastrous. Swells were observed as far away as the port of El Callao in Peru. The tsunami also destroyed the new settlement at the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands, where 35 people died, including the first governor, Navarro Santaella, and his wife.  Consequences  The major consequence of the earthquake was the relocation of the city (14 years after the quake) from its original location, in part as a response by the residents to the successive destructions by the tsunamis of 1730 and 1751. The chosen location (after a long controversy between the civil authorities and the church, headed by Bishop Jos√© de Toro y Zambrano Romo) was the Valle de la Mocha, where Concepci√≥n presently lies. Despite this, the demonym \\"penquista\\" (referring to the original location of the city, at Penco) was kept, and is still used today.  Aftershocks  The earthquake had enough aftershocks that they destroyed any attempts at rebuilding, including the emergency shelters. One of the strongest occurred on June 26, 1751. Approximately half a month later, the aftershocks ceased.  Other dates  Although the majority of sources and accounts make reference to the early morning of May 25, 1751, as the date of the earthquake, other records indicate that it was on the night of May 24. And although the majority of historians say that the foreshocks of the earthquake occurred on the night of May 23, there exist records that indicate that they happened during the 23rd and 24th, with the earthquake happening on the 25th.

It is a sfermion, which means it is a spin-0 boson (scalar boson). While the top quark is the heaviest known quark, the stop squark is actually often the lightest squark in many supersymmetry models.Search For Pair Production of Stop Quarks Mimicking Top Event Signatures Overview The stop squark is a key ingredient of a wide range of SUSY models that address the hierarchy problem of the Standard Model (SM) in a natural way. A boson partner to the top quark would stabilize the Higgs boson mass against quadratically divergent quantum corrections, provided its mass is close to the electroweak symmetry breaking energy scale. If this was the case then the stop squark would be accessible at the Large Hadron Collider. In the generic R-parity conserving Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) the scalar partners of right-handed and left-handed top quarks mix to form two stop mass eigenstates. Depending on the specific details of the SUSY model and the mass hierarchy of the sparticles, the stop might decay into a bottom quark and a chargino, with a subsequent decay of the chargino into the lightest neutralino (which is often the lightest supersymmetric particle). Evidence Many searches for evidence of the stop squark have been performed by both the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC but so far no signal has been discovered. In January 2019, the CMS Collaboration published findings excluding stop squarks with masses as large as 1230 GeV at 95% (2œÉ) confidence level.

History and overview Economic growth in the Argentine Northwest city of Tucum√°n, as in cities nationwide, created the need for unprecedented urban improvements during the late nineteenth century. The first public official to rally to this need was the Minister of Education of the Province of Tucum√°n, Alberto Le√≥n Soldati, who in 1898 proposed the creation of an extensive green space such as those under development in Buenos Aires, Rosario and C√≥rdoba, the nation's three largest cities. Tucum√°n's need for a modern recreational park was especially prescient, as the city was then still limited by a colonial grid of narrow streets and its relative isolation.sanmigueldetucuman.gov.ar Elected Senator for his province, Soldati commissioned the Parks Director for the city of Buenos Aires, French Argentine urbanist Charles Thays, to create a central public park for Tucum√°n. Thays drafted plans for a 400 hectare (1000 acre) green space to the east of the city, on which work began in 1906. Following the purchase of the remaining needed land, work accelerated on the project and the park was inaugurated on July 9, 1916, the centennial of the Argentine Declaration of Independence.La Gaceta The inaugurated park was a 100 hectare (250 acre) segment centered on Bishop Jos√© Colombres' historic residence. Father Colombres introduced sugarcane to Tucum√°n in 1821, and the crop quickly became the province's economic mainstay (it still is its predominant agricultural crop). Lake San Miguel (named in honor of the city's patron saint) and a rose garden were created to the south of the historic residence, common denominators to most of Thays' public parks. The founder and first President of the University of Tucum√°n, Doctor Juan Bautista Ter√°n, purchased 20 cast iron, glazed sculptures in France for the park and the planned Liberal Arts campus therein, opened in 1914. Later additions included a campground, a topiary sun dial, the Tucum√°n Lawn Tennis Club, the Municipal Cultural Center and Sports Complex, the University's Odontology and Physics campuses and the Nasif Est√©fano Speedway. The southern three-fourths of the park was never completed, however. The parkland south of Lake San Miguel was gradually replaced facilities such as the Tucum√°n Hippodrome and a public orphanage built by the Eva Per√≥n Foundation (opened in person by the first lady in 1950). The 1956 expropriation of 466 hectares (1183 acres) for the construction of Matienzo Airport included most of the remaining, incomplete southern portion, and dashed plans to recover the remainder of the park.

Compared to the Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal (the WAT) it is a shorter Afrikaans explanatory dictionary in a single volume. The latest edition of the HAT, the sixth, was published in 2015, 50 years after the first edition of 1965. HAT6 comprises 1,636 pages. History Understanding the history of the HAT requires an understanding of the relationship between the HAT and the Woordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal (the WAT), initially known as Die Afrikaanse Woordeboek. During the 1920s earnest discussions were devoted to the compilation of an Afrikaans dictionary and in March 1926 the erstwhile Nasionale Boekhandel and the government of the day agreed to the publication of a monolingual explanatory dictionary with an extent similar to that of the Dutch Van Dale (a single-volume work) at the time. J.J. Smith, professor of Afrikaans at the University of Stellenbosch, would be the editor, and the aim was to complete the work within three years. With hindsight the time allocated to this task was completely unrealistic, but it does show with what urgency it was regarded. When the dictionary was not completed in the proposed time, the University of Stellenbosch took over Nasionale Boekhandel's part of the contract, setting an (equally unrealistic) target of publishing the dictionary within five years. After about 20 years Prof. Smith's health failed him. He took leave but did not resume his work on the dictionary. He was succeeded in 1947 as chief editor by Dr. P.C. Schoonees, a school principal from Vryheid. In the meantime the goal of the WAT had shifted quite drastically. A commission of inquiry recommended that a board of control be established. This placed the WAT undertaking on firmer footing. The secretary of education would serve as chairperson and the rector of the University of Stellenbosch as administrator. Hereafter the goal was no longer to compile a desk dictionary, but a comprehensive work that would record and explain the ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù Afrikaans vocabulary, such as the OED (The Oxford English Dictionary) for English and the WNT (Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal) for Dutch. Such a work could certainly not be completed in five years‚Äô time. Under Schoonees's guidance the first part of the dictionary (A‚ÄîC) was published in 1951, the second part (D‚ÄîF) in 1955 and the third part (G) in 1957. It was now clear that dictionary could progress, but at the same it was equally clear that in spite of a sizeable expansion of the editorial team it would prove impossible to complete such a comprehensive work within a couple of years.  First edition (1965)  Consequently, towards the end of the 1950s, beginning of the 1960s, the board of control decided that compilation of a ‚Äústandard‚Äù or ‚Äúdesk‚Äù dictionary should commence alongside the work on the comprehensive dictionary. Adverts were placed for the post of editor (according to the plan this would be a one-person job), but although many applications were received, the board back-pedalled and made no appointment. The discussions, however, did have a positive result: Schoonees accepted the challenge to compile an Afrikaans desk dictionary in his own time. The board of control approved his undertaking; moreover, it gave him permission to use the WAT‚Äôs material for his task. Thus a close connection was established between the WAT and the first edition of the HAT, a bond that would be broken only after Schoonees died. In spite of Schoonees's enthusiasm and perseverance it soon became apparent that for one person to compile a desk dictionary from scratch in a relatively short time was a very difficult if not impossible task. With the help of C.J. Swanepoel, a co-editor of the WAT, the work accelerated somewhat, but according to Schoonees still not quickly enough. Dr. S.J. du Toit, another co-editor of the WAT, was seconded too, and later the Afrikaans teacher, C. Murray Booysen, joined the team as well. The first edition of the Verklarende Handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal was published in 1965 under all four names, though by then Booysen had retired for health reasons. Although Schoonees was the de facto chief editor, he was not named as such. HAT1 was published by Voortrekkerpers, which would some years later merge with the Afrikaanse Pers Boekhandel to form Perskor. HAT2 and HAT3 were published by Perskor. HAT4 (still with the Perskor imprint) and HAT5 were published by Pearson Education South Africa, a division of Maskew Miller Longman, into which Perskor was incorporated in the late 1990s.  Second edition (1979)  HAT 2nd edition, 4th impression from 1984 In 1971 Perskor offered Francois F. Odendal, professor in Afrikaans and Dutch linguistics at the then Rand Afrikaans University and chairperson of the language commission of the South African Academy for Science and Arts, the editorship of the HAT. At this point Odendal had published several papers on the lexicography. He had worked at the state terminology bureau for three years and had served as co-editor and assistant chief editor of the WAT for ten years. His lengthy association (since 1962) with the language commission had kept him in touch with the practice of wordsmithing. Odendal accepted Perskor's offer and asked the publisher what it considered a realistic time for the completion of the work. The answer was two years. Odendal set the target at four years. Eventually the thorough revision would consume eight years. In 1972 Odendal assumed full responsibility for HAT2. Thus a new chapter in the history of the HAT began, with Odendal as the sole editor for almost 25 years. For the second edition he expanded the dictionary by about 50%, this constituting a truly revised edition. Besides additions definitions were altered and archaic words and meanings deleted, especially words and meanings that were more Dutch than Afrikaans. (Here the contribution of Mrs Estelle Odendal should be mentioned, who recorded new and missing words from newspapers, magazines and books the whole time her husband was working on the HAT.) An aspect to which Odendal gave special attention while working on HAT2 was the expansion and improvement of example phrases, since words ‚Äúin action‚Äù in well-chosen example phrases, in syntactical context therefore, reveal their meaning better than definitions on their own do. HAT2 was published in 1979 by Perskor under Odendal's name, with the names of the original four editors (even though their contribution had ceased). The dictionary had a favourable reception, prompting Odendal to continue with the work with a third edition in mind.  Third edition (1993)  It soon became apparent that the HAT had captured its particular niche in the market and was accepted as authoritative by the Afrikaans public. The dictionary was to be found in most homes, schools and universities, as well as in government offices and businesses. Particularly important was that in the determination of the meaning of a word in higher and lower courts, the HAT was accepted as the authority. Also that newspapers and the writers of letters to the press, where the meaning of a word was concerned, regularly quoted the HAT as an authoritative reference. The HAT had become a household name. When Perskor began talking about a third edition with intent, Odendal started to work on the dictionary full-time. He left the service of RAU in 1989, two years before his compulsory retirement date, to complete the revision. HAT3 was published in 1993 and was received exceptionally well by the media, even better than HAT2. In the late 1990s HAT3 was also released in an electronic format ‚Äì the first Afrikaans dictionary on CD-ROM, called el-HAT. In preparing HAT3 Odendal tried to improve all facets of HAT2. The extent of the dictionary was increased by 30% (made possible by setting the text in three columns instead of two). More archaic words were carefully removed and labels in particular were systematically revised (which meant that a word without a label could be assumed to be standard Afrikaans). Labelling racist words proved quite a challenge, and to a lesser extent gender words. There was considerable pressure to delete such words in their entirety so as not to offend any user of Afrikaans. However, Odendal's standpoint was that for a complete view on the Afrikaans vocabulary some of these words had to be included. This category of words was treated with much more circumspection and empathy than in the past. With the correct labels (as well as with the wording of the definitions) every effort was made to give sufficient indication of the status of these words. The value Odendal attached to example phrases has been mentioned. In HAT3 he increased the number of self-made examples, and supplemented them with a large number of citations from the work of Afrikaans writers. Hereby the high standard of the Afrikaans literature was acknowledged, as well as its contribution to the development of Afrikaans. As in the previous editions particular attention was given to fixed expressions and idioms, elucidated and grouped in a set fashion at the end of a lemma. HAT3 was the first Afrikaans dictionary in which the compiler tried to give a proper explanation of the modus operandi and the theoretical principles on which a dictionary is based. Still lacking was a schematic representation of the various components of a lemma, something which could be of great help to the user. This was rectified in HAT4 and even more so in HAT5.  Fourth edition (2000)  To ensure that the HAT stayed in capable hands when he could no longer participate, Odendal proposed to Perskor in the 1990s that it was time to appoint a second, younger editor. His pre-eminent status as theoretical and practical lexicographer made Rufus H. Gouws, professor in Afrikaans linguistics at the University of Stellenbosch, an excellent choice. Both Perskor and Gouws accepted the proposal. In the planning of HAT4 Gouws and Odendal decided that the allocated time precluded an incisive revision of HAT3. For a general revision the dictionary was divided between the editors into two equal parts. Odendal would take the first half, Gouws the second. However, one editor would be responsible for a particular aspect from A to Z, such as adding citations, refining the labels, and supplementing and checking computer terms. In spite of the limited time archaisms were deleted and many new words added. An innovation was the (circumspect) inclusion of a number of English words, which garnered some criticism, but also support. A diagram illustrating the various components of a lemma was included in the front matter of the book. HAT4 was published in 2000 by Pearson Education South Africa, a division of Maskew Miller Longman, into which Perskor was incorporated. (The name Perskor was retained as imprint for the fourth edition.)  Fifth edition (2005)  HAT 5th edition with CD-ROM In 2003 Pearson asked the compilers to deliver a fifth edition in 2004. Both editors reacted negatively: the time was too little. As a more realistic target Gouws suggested 2005, also to let the publication of HAT5 coincide with the fortieth anniversary of the first publication of the HAT in 1965. For HAT5 the two editors again took responsibility for one half of the dictionary, Gouws the first half, Odendal the second (the reverse of HAT4). As with HAT4 each editor assumed special responsibility for particular aspects of the dictionary as a whole: expanding the etymologies, improving the lemma layout, expanding the abbreviations and moving them to a special section at the back of the book, adding a section of geographical names with their derivatives, refining the labels further, sourcing additional suitable citations, and compiling a complete usage guide for the front matter. In addition more ‚Äúforeign‚Äù yet common words were included and, with circumspection, words from varieties other than standard Afrikaans. HAT5 is the first edition of which the lemma selection was based on a representative, comprehensive and balanced electronic corpus. Odendal would have retired from the editorial team after the completion of the fourth edition of the HAT, but for various reasons stayed on till HAT5 was completed. At the launch of HAT5, on 14 September 2005 at the Spier Estate outside Stellenbosch, he was honoured for his more than 30 years of commitment and dedication to the Handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal and bid farewell.  e-HAT 2009  In October 2007 Pearson Education appointed Jana Luther, inter alia former senior editor of the Pharos Afrikaans-English-English-Afrikaans Dictionary (2005) and co-editor of the Pharos Afrikaans-English-English-Afrikaans Concise Dictionary (2007), as dictionary compiler and publisher. In 2008 she joined Gouws as editor for the preparation of HAT6. A CD-ROM ‚Äì e-HAT 2009 ‚Äì was launched with the third impression of HAT5 in March 2009. This electronic dictionary contains the complete alphabetical list, list of abbreviations and list of geographical names and their derivatives of the fifth edition of the Verklarende Handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal (of which the third impression got a new cover and the title was truncated to Handwoordeboek van die Afrikaanse Taal). Typographical and spelling errors that were brought to the editors‚Äô attention since the publication of the fifth edition in 2005 were corrected in the electronic dictionary and, in accordance with the Afrikaanse woordelys en spelre√´ls of the Afrikaans language commission of the SA Academy, certain improvements were applied. e-HAT 2009 is the first step on the road to a new, sixth, improved and comprehensively revised edition of the HAT that is intended to mirror contemporary Afrikaans. The work on this new edition has been ongoing at Pearson South Africa since 2008 and was nearing completion at the beginning of 2015. To assist in the preparation of HAT6, Pearson in 2012 appointed Fred Pheiffer, a former colleague of Luther and likewise co-editor of the abovementioned two Pharos dictionaries. In addition he worked as compiler, co-editor and project manager on the Oxford Bilingual School Dictionary: isiZulu and English (2010), the Oxford South African School Dictionary (2010), the Oxford Afrikaanse Skoolwoordeboek (2012) and the Oxford Bilingual School Dictionary: isiXhosa and English (2014).

The name derives from the common practice of colouring the territory of the British Empire red or pink on political maps. Initially the term was used to apply only to steamship routes (as these were the only practical way of carrying communications between Great Britain and the rest of the Empire), particularly to India via the Suez Canal‚Äîa route sometimes referred to as the British Imperial Lifeline.. Rail transport was used across France and Italy to the Mediterranean. From 1868 to 1871 the Mont Cenis Pass Railway, a temporary mountain railway line over the Mont Cenis Pass was used for mail. After use of steamships became widespread at sea, strategically placed coaling stations were acquired to guarantee the mobility of both civil and naval fleets. In the 1880s the term \\"All-Red Route\\" was expanded to include the telegraph network (see All Red Line) that connected various parts of the Empire, and by the 1920s it was also being used in reference to proposed air routes, initially airship and then flying boat, between Great Britain and the rest of the Empire, see Imperial Airship Scheme. The Suez Canal route dramatically shortened the sea path between Britain and its colonies in Asia. Conscious of its significance, the British sent troops to seize control of the canal when they occupied Egypt in 1882. Even after British troops were withdrawn from the rest of Egypt in accordance with the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, Britain continued to control the canal and kept troops stationed in the canal zone. After Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalised the canal in 1956, sparking the Suez Crisis, UK Prime Minister Anthony Eden declared that \\"The Egyptian has his thumb on our windpipe\\",. describing the Suez as the \\"great imperial lifeline\\". The major \\"All-Red Route\\" ran as follows: Southern Britain ‚Üí Gibraltar ‚Üí Malta ‚Üí Alexandria ‚Üí Port Said (after construction of the Canal) ‚Üí Suez ‚Üí Aden ‚Üí Muscat (and access to the Persian Gulf) ‚Üí India ‚Üí Sri Lanka ‚Üí Burma ‚Üí Malaya ‚Üí Singapore (branching out into the Pacific Ocean towards Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, and other British colonies). With the end of the British Empire and the increasing prevalence of air travel, the terms \\"All-Red Route\\" and \\"British Imperial Lifeline\\" have fallen from use, and now exist largely in a historical context, generally in reference to the routes in use during the British Empire.

On World Book Day, every child in full-time education in the UK is given a voucher to be spent on books; the event was first celebrated in the United Kingdom in 1995. The event is the local manifestation of the original, global World Book Day organized by UNESCO to promote reading, publishing, and copyright, and widely observed on 23 April. Organizers in the UK moved the observance to avoid clashes with Easter school holidays and with St George's Day. Conversely, the World Book Night event organized by independent charity The Reading Agency is held on 23 April.World Book Night website History The United Kingdom's own version of World Book Day began in 1998, launched by Prime Minister Tony Blair at the Globe Theatre in London. Several million schoolchildren in the UK were given a special ¬£1 World Book Day Book Token (‚Ç¨1.50 in Ireland) which could be redeemed against any book in any UK bookshop. A specially created WBD anthology priced at ¬£1 (‚Ç¨1.50 in Ireland) was also published. All World Book Day point of sale and the ¬£1 book carried the special World Book Day logo to help unify the initiative through all outlets. Since then, World Book Day UK has followed a similar pattern, gradually growing each year to encompass more initiatives, such as Spread The Word, Quick Reads Initiative and Books for Hospitals. Every year, the number of children receiving a World Book Day Book Token has increased. In 2000, instead of a single ¬£1 special anthology, four separate ¬£1 books were published, covering a wider age-range. Since then, each year has seen a new set of special ¬£1 books published. In 2006, World Book Day began its support of and association with the Quick ReadsQuick Reads website initiative for adult emergent readers. In 2007, World Book Day celebrated its 10th anniversary with the publication of 10 ¬£1 books. Since then every child in full-time education in the UK and Ireland is entitled to receive a ¬£1 World Book day Book token every year. They can swap their WBD token for one of specially-produced ¬£1 WBD books or they can get ¬£1 off a full-price book or audio book priced ¬£2.99 or more. Administration World Book Day is a registered charity. Charity Commission It does not raise funds for itself but does support Book Aid International Book Aid International website and Readathon as its nominated charities, encouraging schools to hold special fundraising events for children less fortunate than themselves. World Book Day is not funded by the British Government although the Quick Reads element does receive support from ACE, DIUS and NIACE.

It did not win the contest and only one was built. Development In 1927, driven by conflicting pressures of an ageing, World War I aircraft stock and the continual need for economy the Air Ministry was attracted by the idea of a general-purpose, multi-tasking machine which used many components from the large stocks of Airco DH.9A accumulated ten years before. The result was Air Ministry specification 26/27, which also encouraged the use of a metal airframe for use overseas and of the abundant Napier Lion engine. At least eight manufacturers responded and the Goral was Gloster's submission. The Goral was an all-metal framed, fabric-covered biplane using DH9A wings of two- bay construction and of slight stagger, with parallel interplane struts. There were ailerons on all wings. The fuselage was oval in cross section and quite slim. The wire-braced, round-tipped tailplane carried unbalanced elevators but the small fin carried a square-topped horn-balanced rudder. The pilot sat under the wing trailing edge cutout, with the gunner behind him, his gun on a ring, mounted on the raised rear decking. The undercarriage had a single axle strutted to the fuselage near the front spar and forward to the engine firewall.Flight, 28 July 1927 The Goral was powered by an uncowled 425 hp (315 kW) Bristol Jupiter VIA radial engine rather than the suggested Lion, driving a 12 ft (3.65 m) two-bladed fixed-pitch propeller. The engine exhausts ran along both sides of the lower fuselage from the Goral's long nose to below the gunner's cockpit. The Goral was designed to allow the wings to be replaced with those from existing DH.9A stocks and the fuselage was constructed so that metal components could be replaced by wooden ones to optimise the possibility of overseas sales. Nevertheless, these did not materialise, despite Argentinian interest as late as 1931. At home, the Goral had been in competition for the Air Ministry contract almost immediately after its first flight in February 1927. The competition winner was the Westland Wapiti. The name Goral is the local name for a goat-antelope, native to the mountains of Northern India, Nemorhaedus goral.

He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1948 and chairman or member in different industrial, political and cultural boards, Nordenson held positions in industry as technical director and CEO. He wrote his first book about Einstein's theories in Swedish in 1922, which developed into his 1969 English book, Relativity, Time and Reality . He studied the philosophy of H√§gerstr√∂m and Phal√®n, and describes also their opinions about Einstein's theories in his book, together with reviews of many other contributors. His book, Relativity, Time and Reality, is a controversial critique of Albert Einstein's concepts of time and simultaneity in Special Relativity. His arguments have been generally considered invalid. The primary objection in the first part of his critique is that Einstein's concept of simultaneity, while seemingly not depending on Newtonian time, nevertheless presupposes it: Nordenson was a member of the upper house of the Parliament of Sweden from 1938 to 1953, representing the National Organization of the Right.

He is mostly known for his novel Titash Ekti Nadir Naam (A River Called Titash) published in the monthly Mohammadi five years after his death. Early life and education Book cover of the English version of Titash Ekti Nadir Naam Mallabarman was born in a Malo family in Gokarnoghat village beside the Titash River, near Brahmanbaria town in, Comilla District of current Bangladesh, then undivided Bengal. He was the second of four children and lost his parents when he was a child. His two brothers died shortly after, and his sister (widowed soon after marriage) died before he went to Calcutta at the age of 20. As a boy and a teenager, until he left for college, he lived in the village with his uncle. He was the first child from the Mallo community of the village and nearby area to finish school. Members of the Malo community collected subscriptions to support his school expenses (mainly books, since his school fees were either waived or covered by scholarships he received). He attended the town's elementary school and Annada High School. He matriculated from the school in 1933 and went on to Comilla Victoria College. In part because of financial difficulty, he left college in 1934 and went to Calcutta to work as a literary editor. Career Throughout his teen years he wrote prodigiously, mostly poetry, and published in student magazines. Those early writings were highly acclaimed, so much so that peers who aspired to be writers sought his opinion on their work before sending it to a publisher. Mallabarman's first job in Calcutta was as assistant editor of a literary and news magazine, Navashakti. After three years with the magazine, he worked as an editorial assistant for a literary monthly, Mohammadi, in which he also published a number of his poems and parts of what was evidently the first draft of Titash Ekti Nadir Naam ( It is also filmed by Ritwik Ghatak); he continued to work for Mohammadi until its Muslim publisher closed the monthly and emigrated from India. During this period he also worked for the newspaper Azad. In 1945, he joined the literary weekly Desh and the daily Ananda Bazar Patrika. From 1945 through 1950 a number of his poems, stories, essays, and translations were published in Desh and other magazines. Death In 1950, Mallabarman was diagnosed with tuberculosis. he had felt increasingly unwell for two years. Entrusting the just-finalized manuscript of Titash Ekti Nadir Naam to friends, he went for hospital treatment. Soon after his release he suffered a relapse and was readmitted. Before the second phase of his treatment was over, however, he walked out of the hospital. Two months later, on 16 April 1951, he died.

A Member of Parliament (MP) for one year, he was Civil Lord of the Admiralty in the first Labour Government. Early life Hodges was born in Woolaston in Gloucestershire in 1887, but moved to Wales at a young age. At the age of 14 he was working at the Powell Tillery Pit in Abertillery, and due to his desire to read, he came to the attention of one of the mining officials, who sponsored him to attend night school. At the age of sixteen, inspired by the preacher Evan Roberts,Morgan, Kenneth O. Rebirth of a Nation, Oxford University Press (1982) page 76. he became a Methodist and was soon preaching in the evenings. Like many trade unionists before him, he found his religious beliefs tied into the plight of the coal-miners, and joined the Trade Union movement. At the same time his political views led him to become a member of the Independent Labour Party. At the age of eighteen, Hodges heard Philip Snowden addressing a crowd. He found Snowden inspirational and from that moment he saw the politician as his 'ideal'. Hodges was also shaped by the views of the Welsh syndicalist Noah Ablett,Morgan, Kenneth O. Rebirth of a Nation, Oxford University Press (1982) page 151. whose Plebs' League he later joined. Through his trade union links, Hodges secured a scholarship to Ruskin College, Oxford, and spent two years there from 1909. Although many of the students from Ruskin were not treated with the same equality as those at other Oxford colleges, Hodges found the life away from the coal mines to be to his liking, describing it as the great time of his life. In 1911, after the end of his studies, Hodges spent a brief time in Paris, where he stayed with the Marxist Paul Lafargue and his wife Laura Marx, only a few months before their joint suicide. Political and union career After leaving Oxford, Hodges returned to work in the mines. After his time at Oxford he found the manual work as a hewer unbearable and attempted to find more intellectual work. He answered an advertisement for a job as a trade union agent, and was accepted as the Garw district representative of the South Wales Miners' Federation.Durham Mining Museum Frank Hodges, J.P. Biographical notes Now twenty four, Hodges was in a career where he felt he could change the lives of others for the better, and started reforming his district's organisation. His work as a union agent was rewarded when in 1919 he became the Permanent Secretary of the Miners‚Äô Federation of Great Britain. In this role he negotiated terms and conditions for the mining industry with the Government which included meetings with Lloyd George. In 1921, The South Wales Miners' Federation called for strike action after the coalowners demanded a reduction in wages from the miners. The miners rejected the terms and were locked out. The Miners' Federation called upon the aid of the Triple Alliance and a strike was called for the 12 April. While preparations were taking place for the strike, the leaders of the Triple Alliance pushed the strike back to 15 April; in the interim, Hodges approached MPs independently in the hope of securing a temporary solution. When asked by the MPs if the miners would accept a wage that would not fall below the cost of living, Hodges stated that \\"any such offer...would receive very serious consideration\\".Lalkar 80th Anniversary of the British General Strike - 1926 This action was seen as an act of betrayal by the miners' executive and Hodges lost the support of his own union.New Worker 1926 - General Strike The Alliance fell apart and many unions withdrew their support, leaving the workers in an impossible situation as solidarity broke down; the event became known as 'Black Friday'. In 1923, Hodges ran for political office, as Member of Parliament for Lichfield as a Labour candidate. He won the seat becoming part of the first Labour Government, under the leadership of Ramsay MacDonald and was given the office of First Lord of the Admiralty. It was during his period as a Member of Parliament that Hodges was invited to the Rhondda to play at Ton Pentre golf club in a game with the Duke of York before he became King George VI.Rhondda Cynon Taff Library Service Heritage Trail Now a government minister, and seen as an increasing moderate, the Miners' Federation took the opportunity to replace Hodges as Secretary. Hodges understood his position was no longer secure and resigned before he was pushed out. His replacement was the far more radical Arthur Cook from the Rhondda district. The next year, Hodges left his political post and was appointed a member of the Central Electricity Board in 1926. Written works * Nationalisation of the mines (1920) pub.

They released four albums before splitting up in 1991. The only constant member was singer/guitarist Phil Parfitt. History The first incarnation of the band was named Orange Disaster, with Parfitt joined by Ken Renny (bass), and Alison Pate (guitar).Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p.452 This line-up released a seven-inch EP called \\"Something's Got To Give\\" on Neuter Records, Catalogue Number OD 01. Often mislabeled as 1982 - the release date that is given on the labels is 1.9.1980 (1 September 1980). After this they changed their name to The Architects of Disaster. Parfitt was then joined by Tony Pettitt (bass), Nod Wright (drums) and Paul Wright (guitar). This line-up disbanded, having released one single, \\"Cucumber Sandwich\\"/\\"Friendly Fire.\\" Nod Wright and Tony Pettit then left to form Fields of the Nephilim with Parfitt recruiting Grant Davidson (bass) and later John Saltwell (bass), Dan Cross (guitar), and Malcolm Catto (drums). They returned in 1984 as The Perfect Disaster, with an eponymous debut album issued on the French Kampa label in 1985. In 1987, the band signed to Glass Records, which reissued their debut album, and followed it with a twelve-inch EP later that year. There were further line-up changes when Saltwell and Pate departed, replaced by multi-instrumentalist Josephine Wiggs. The band moved on to Fire Records, releasing the Asylum Road album in 1988. Catto also left, with Phil Outram and Martin Langshaw joining for their third album, Up, which reached number fifteen on the UK Indie Chart, and saw the band touring with The Jesus and Mary Chain.Lazell, Barry (1997) Indie Hits 1980-1989, Cherry Red Books, Larkin, Colin (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Indie & New Wave, Virgin Books, , p.318 In 1989, Wiggs left to join The Breeders, with Saltwell returning.

Intuitive definition When a particle is considered to have no mass or to have an infinitesimal charge, this can be described as saying that we deal with a probe and that back-reaction is neglected. However, a real object also carries (in general) a mass and a charge itself. These properties imply that the model of the original environment needs to be modified to reach self-consistency. For example, a particle can be described as helping to curve the space in general relativity. Taking into account the constraints implied on the model by the particle's properties ‚Äì the back-reaction ‚Äì is one way of reaching a more accurate model than if those constraints are ignored. Cosmology In inhomogeneous cosmology, in which structure formation is taken into account in a general-relativistic model of the Universe, the term \\"backreaction\\" is used for a measure of the non-commutativity of the averaging procedure :G_{\\\\mu u}(\\\\overline{g_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}}) eq \\\\overline{G_{\\\\mu u}(g_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta})} = \\\\frac{8\\\\pi G}{c^4}\\\\overline{T_{\\\\mu u}} (which comes from the non-linearity of Einstein field equations) and the dynamical evolution of spatial slices of space-time. , the role of backreaction in possibly leading to an alternative to dark energy is an open question of debate among cosmologists. The existence of a homogeneity length scale can be considered to be that at which the calculations with and without backreaction give the same results. , the existence of such a scale needs experimental confirmation.

Patton, and Wesley Clark Jr. The film stars Jonas Ball, Matthew R. Anderson, and Michael C. Williams. The plot revolves around CIA Agent Benjamin Keynes recalling the time when he led a Special Forces team through the mountains of Afghanistan in search of an Afghan cleric, only to encounter strange paranormal sarwesh incidents. It premiered in Morocco in April 2008 and in the United States in February 2009. Plot In Ghazni Province, Afghanistan, a U.S. Army Special Forces team consisting of team leader Chief Warrant Officer Wally Hamer, Master-Sergeant Kenny Tanner, and Sergeants Vince Degetau, Joe Trinoski, Tim Cole, and Pete Sadler meets CIA Agent Benjamin Keynes, who indicates that their mission is to find a very important Afghan cleric by the name of Mohammed Aban. Hamer, briefs the men to be ready. After being inserted, the team finds a local guide, Abdul, in a village in Southern Afghanistan, where Aban is from. Together, they go to the mountains, where the cleric has a reputation for hiding. As they go further into the mountains, they begin to have strange encounters. First, they are ambushed by gunmen who kill Trinoski. The team returns fire, killing multiple gunmen, but when they check the bodies, they have disappeared. That night, the team spots headlights of a vehicle approaching. However, the two lights separate and then speedily fly into the sky and disappear. After speculating on what the lights may have been, they radio for a helicopter to resupply them. The next day, they cannot get reception on their radio or GPS. Their truck, damaged from the ambush, is struggling to move up the mountain. At night, the team hears a helicopter approaching, though they cannot spot it. As their radio is not working, they attempt to signal the helicopter. As the helicopter, still unseen, seems to be directly on top of them, the noise abruptly stops (something that shouldn't be physically possible). Meanwhile, the radio picks up what sounds like Persian or Arabic, but no one can understand it. They cache Trinoski's body so that they can move to a safer position for the night. The next morning, the team finds parts of Trinoski's body strewn out across rocks. Further up the mountain, they spot strange, triangular markers made of sticks across the mountain's surface. As they continue on foot with their mission in the rocky and barren landscape, fatigue, frustration and confusion take their toll on the members of the team and they come across a cave. Inside, they find an old man who gives them shelter and refills their canteens. Sergeant Sadler notices that under the man's robes, he appears to be wearing a nineteenth-century British army uniform. Sadler tells the others of a legend of how a British regiment disappeared in Afghanistan's mountains, leaving only one survivor. In the morning Sergeant Cole observes the old man apparently talking to himself, but when Cole looks through his night vision goggles, he sees a group of men with swords in black robes. Panicking, the soldier opens fire, accidentally killing the old man. Abdul says they must bury the body, but Keynes orders the team to move on in case the enemy heard them. Degeteau develops horrible stomach pains. As he tries to drink from a canteen, he finds that it is filled with sand, as are the containers of everyone else. Further on, Abdul is surprised to find that there is an entire valley that wasn't there previously. Tensions further increase when the team encounters a bright light at night. As Tanner and Cole try to flank the light, believing it to be a ruse by the Taliban, they're immediately vaporized. The next morning, Abdul warns Keynes that they are dealing with a supernatural phenomenon that is beyond human conception and has deadly consequences; he then commits suicide by stepping off a cliff. As the team progresses further and tensions among the men increase, the remaining soldiers confront Keynes and demand the truth. Keynes shows them a recording from his thermal imaging camera and informs them about the real motive. The thermal video shows a triangular object in the desert. Being nearly invisible to the naked eye, it lifts off the ground after three (supposed) men, including Mohammed Aban, walk to it and vanishes right in front of Keynes' eyes. It was this object that killed the men. The CIA has been monitoring this phenomenon since 1980 and sent Keynes and the special forces team there to further investigate it. The whole time, Keynes has been recording with his special thermal camera and sending the images to Langley via an advanced laser aimed at CIA satellites. Keynes theorizes that this object originates from an ancient Indian mythology called 'Vimanas', a sort of UFO-related phenomenon that occurred when Alexander the Great rode through this area of land as he was conquering, and the bright lights and the ghostly gunmen are associated with it. He also explains that the team is an 'expendable' for the investigation and they will not be rescued, which causes a brief scuffle with the agitated team leader, who disappears the next morning. Running out of ammunition, water and food, the team wanders further into the desert where they finally encounter the vimanas at what appears to be the location that the British regiment was destroyed. Sadler, overwhelmed with fear, opens fire upon the seemingly invisible vimanas only to be vaporized. Keynes flees with Degetau and abandons him later, as he is too sick to continue, and later hears his screams before being obliterated by the objects. Exhausted and traumatized, Keynes searches for water. He encounters an oasis and drinks water from it only to discover the body of Hamer laying next to the water. Unable to grasp the horror, he passes out. When he wakes up in the night, he hears the distant sound of a helicopter and fires his flare gun. Simultaneously, several flares fire up from the valley. The bright light he encountered earlier re-appears and two beings from it approach him. As it touches his forehead, he sees visions and hallucinations of various objects and landscapes from his previous encounters, causing him to go into a trance. In the final scene he is shown floating several inches above a bed with a talisman he took from Aban's home in his hand, inside a hospital room, where doctors and a military colonel are watching him through a glass window. In a trance, he finally whispers, \\"It will save us all...\\" In the final credits, interviews of Keynes' wife are shown in which she says that the family has not yet been informed about him and concludes him to be missing.

Characteristics  The lira of Calabria is a bowed string instrument with three strings. Like most bowed liras, it is played upright, usually supported on the knee, held with the left hand touching the strings with the nails laterally while the right hand moves the bow. The repertory of the lira includes accompaniment songs (e.g. serenades and songs of anger) and songs suitable for dancing (tarantellas). The repertory of this traditional instrument is known only through records of older players, or people who have known them. On the other hand, in recent years an increased interest around this instrument has led to its use by music groups of traditional music and to the appearance of new manufacturers in different parts of Calabria.  Origin  The Calabrian lira is closely related to the bowed lira (Greek: ŒªœçœÅŒ±) of the Byzantine Empire. The Persian geographer of the 9th century Ibn Khurradadhbih (died 911) was the first to cite the Byzantine lira, as a typical bowed instrument of the Byzantines (Margaret J. Kartomi, 1990). Similar bowed instruments descendants of the Byzantine lira have continued to be played in many post-Byzantine regions until the present day with small changes: the gadulka in Bulgaria, the lyra of Crete and the Dodecanese in Greece, the lyra of Pontos and the classical kemenche (Turkish:Armud√Æ kemen√ße, Greek:Œ†ŒøŒªŒØœÑŒπŒ∫Œ∑ ŒõœçœÅŒ± ~ Politiki lira) in Turkey. The Byzantine lira spread westward to Europe, with uncertain evolution; authors in the 11th and 12th centuries use the words fiddle and lira interchangeably (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2009).

He is known for his faith-healing movement and initiated the \\"One God, One Nation movement\\" in India. Early life, education and early career R. Paulaseer Lawrie was born to father, Deva Rasiah, and mother, Nesammal, at the Lakshmi Tea Estate in Munnar, Kerala. Soon after his birth, the family moved to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Paulaseer stayed back to study at St. John's College, located in Palayamkottai, Tamil Nadu. After finishing the intermediate class of university studies, he went to Ceylon and studied commercial subjects for one year. He then went to Wesley College, Colombo, located in Colombo to gain the London Matric certificate. After this, he went back to Madras, Tamil Nadu, and joined the Christian College, located in Tambaram, Tamil Nadu, for a Bachelor of Arts degree. As World War II began, a vigorous recruiting for officers was afoot. Paulaseer wanted to join the Indian Army and took some training. On knowing this, his father came over and forced Paulaseer to return with him to Ceylon. Paulaseer came back to India to continue his studies. He got a seat in St. Xavier's College, located in Palayamkottai, Tamil Nadu. In August 1942, when the national leaders launched the Quit India Movement, he organized a big student strike in his college. The police attempted to apprehend him, but he managed to escape to Ceylon where, soon after arrival, he got a job in one of the tea estates as a stenographer.Bergunder, Michael (2003). \\"From Pentecostal Healing Evangelist to Kalki Avatar\\", in Christians and Missionaries in India: Cross-Cultural Communication since 1500, edited by Robert Eric Frykenberg and Alaine M. Low. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. p. 359. Around this time Paulaseer began to read political and religious works and to have visions. In 1946, he went to India on a short holiday. While going with his mother to a friend's house, he saw everything according to the dreams he had had about his wife-to- be. The church, the road, the house and its inmates and every detail flashed back in great vividness. Thus assured that the girl in that house was the one chosen by the Lord, he consented to marry, and they were engaged. His mother was there, but his father was in Ceylon. So the marriage had to be postponed for six months; it occurred 26 May 1947. When his first child was seriously ill, Paulaseer prayed in an Anglican church and promised to devote his life to God if the child recovered. After his son's recovery, he resigned his job in Ceylon and returned to India. He took a job on the Yercaud Estate, located in Tamil Nadu, and later at the Christian Medical College Hospital, (CMCH)located in Vellore, Tamil Nadu. Evangelical career evangelist William M. Branham (unknown date). In response to more visions, Paulaseer resigned his job in 1953 in order to preach. He participated in a Bombay healing crusade of American evangelist William M. Branham in 1954, an acquaintance that was to be important later. A series of \\"miracles\\" sparked interest in Paulaseer's message. After preaching in various towns in South India, he crossed over to Ceylon on two missionary journeys. The first tour lasted from 25 October 1955 to 20 December 1955. The second longer tour was from 8 April 1956 until 17 June 1956. After several years of evangelizing in India, Paulaseer was invited to an international conference in Scotland. From Scotland he went to the United States, where he attempted to acquire backing from an established Pentecostal ministry. This was largely unsuccessful until he met with Branham, who encouraged him in his ministry.Bergunder, Michael (2003). \\"From Pentecostal Healing Evangelist to Kalki Avatar: The Remarkable Life of Paulaseer Lawrie...,\\" in Christians and Missionaries in India: Cross-Cultural Communication since 1500, edited by Robert Eric Frykenberg and Alaine M. Low. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. pp. 357-375. In 1960s, his group gave refuge to the expelled CPM/TPM leader Alwin R. De Alwis. Together they conducted meetings in Vepery, Chennai. Later on when Alwin R. De Alvis started exercising authority over the entire group, Paulaseer left the group and started a new gathering of his followers in a larger hall called Jubilee Hall. In 1967, Paulaseer took a long journey in the West, preaching to many of Branham's followers. In 1969 he took another tour, and this time some Branhamites experienced extraordinary things from his preaching. On 21 July 1969 the day of the Apollo 11 moon landing Paulaseer claimed to have become the second coming of Christ. His followers pointed to Branham's sermons to show that he recognized Paulaseer as such. Paulaseer adopted from Branham a prediction that the Rapture would occur in 1977, and that only 700 would be saved. Many American followers abandoned Paulaseer after his predictions for that year failed to come true.The Healer-Prophet, William Marrion Branham A Study of the Prophetic in American Pentecostalism. Mercer University Press, 1987, pp. 161‚Äì2. . In the 1980s, Paulaseer changed his message somewhat, teaching Aadhi Bali or \\"Supreme Sacrifice\\" an idea from the Purusasukta. He began to draw much more on Hindu and even Muslim ideas, and attracted more native Indian followers.Bergunder, Michael (2003). \\"From Pentecostal Healing Evangelist to Kalki Avatar: The Remarkable Life of Paulaseer Lawrie...,\\" in Christians and Missionaries in India: Cross-Cultural Communication since 1500, edited by Robert Eric Frykenberg and Alaine M.

The game took place at Wrigley Field in Chicago, on September 28, 1998. The Cubs won the game 5‚Äì3, holding the Giants scoreless for the majority of the game until the Giants threatened heavily in the ninth inning and scored all three of their runs. As a result of the game, the Cubs qualified for the postseason and the Giants did not. The game was necessary after both teams finished the season with identical win‚Äìloss records of 89‚Äì73. The Cubs won a coin flip late in the season which, by rule at the time, awarded them home field for the game. This victory advanced the Cubs to the 1998 NL Division Series (NLDS) where they were swept by the Atlanta Braves, ending the Cubs' season. Michael Jordan, a popular Chicago sportsman then ending his career with the Chicago Bulls, threw the game's ceremonial first pitch. In baseball statistics, the tie-breaker counted as the 163rd regular season game for both teams, with all events in the game added to regular season statistics. Background The Cubs finished the previous season at the bottom of the NL Central division with a 68‚Äì94 record while the Giants won the NL West at 90‚Äì72, though were defeated by the eventual World Series champion Florida Marlins in the NLDS. The Giants' Barry Bonds drew criticism for his postseason performance, which had been a recurring criticism dating back to his time with the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Cubs made several offseason acquisitions following the 1997 season including trading Doug Glanville for second baseman Mickey Morandini along with signing Jeff Blauser and Henry Rodr√≠guez as free agents. One notable event of the 1998 season was the race for the home run title and Roger Maris' single-season record of 61 home runs between the Cubs' Sammy Sosa and the St. Louis Cardinals' Mark McGwire. McGwire ultimately won, setting a new record of 70 while Sosa closed the season with 66. Additionally, three teams finished the 1998 season within one game of one another in the race for the National League wild card: the Cubs, Giants, and New York Mets. This late-season race included a dramatic Cubs loss to the Brewers on September 23. The Cubs led 7‚Äì5 with two outs and the bases loaded for the Brewers in the bottom of the ninth inning when Brant Brown dropped a fly ball, allowing three unearned runs to score on his error and losing the Cubs the game. This loss gained notoriety for announcer and former- Cub Ron Santo's call of the final play, yelling \\"Oh, no!\\" as the final runs scored. The Mets were tied with the Cubs and Giants in the wild-card race as late in the season as September 25 at 88‚Äì72. However, the Mets lost their remaining two games and finished their season one game back of the Cubs and Giants who ended tied at 89‚Äì73. This record was also the best non-division- winning record and as such a tie-breaker was necessary to determine the wild- card winner. A coin flip on September 14 gave the Cubs home field advantage, setting Wrigley Field as the location for the game. In the event of a three- way tie the Cubs were presented with the choice to either host two home games or receive a bye and play the winner of a Mets-Giants game on the road because they had the best combined record against the Mets and Giants. Cubs' general manager Ed Lynch decided on the second option, though the choice was moot as the Mets fell out of the race. The Cubs' Steve Trachsel and the Giants' Mark Gardner were slated to start the tie-breaker on the September 28. Game summary alt=An African American man in a white baseball uniform with \\"GIANTS\\" on the chest takes a left-handed baseball swing as a catcher kneels behind him to receive the pitch. The game remained scoreless in the early innings, with only two baserunners apiece for each team through the first three innings. The Giants loaded the bases with two outs in the top of the 4th inning, but Brian Johnson struck out to end the inning. The first runs of the game came in the bottom of the 5th as Henry Rodriguez singled to lead off the inning and scored on a home run by Gary Gaetti to give the Cubs a 2‚Äì0 lead. The Cubs threatened again in the next inning with singles by Lance Johnson and Sammy Sosa. Rich Rodriguez relieved Gardner, but loaded the bases with a walk to Mark Grace and allowed a single to Matt Mieske which scored two more runs and extended the Cubs' lead to 4‚Äì0. John Johnstone relieved Rodriguez and closed the inning without further scoring. After getting one out in the top of the 7th, Steve Trachsel allowed a single and a walk to pinch hitters Brent Mayne and Armando R√≠os respectively. The Cubs double switched, bringing in Matt Karchner to relieve Trachsel and Orlando Merced to play left field. Karchner induced another out before loading the bases on a single by Shawon Dunston. F√©lix Heredia entered in relief of Karchner and got Barry Bonds to ground out to first base to end the inning. The Cubs further extended their lead in the bottom of the 8th inning. After Alvin Morman got Morandini to strike out to open the inning the Giants double switched to bring in Jos√© Mesa to pitch and Bill Mueller at third base. Mesa allowed a single to Sammy Sosa and a double to Mark Grace which advanced Sosa to third. Following a ground out Mesa threw a wild pitch while facing Gaetti and Sosa scored to make the game 5‚Äì0. The Giants responded in the top of the 9th, scoring their only runs of the game. Kevin Tapani allowed successive singles to Brent Mayne and Mueller to open the inning before Terry Mulholland relieved him. Stan Javier singled to score Mayne and Ellis Burks then walked to load the bases. Bonds came to bat with the bases loaded for the second time in the game and lined out to deep right field, scoring Mueller on a sacrifice fly and Javier advanced to third base. Rod Beck entered and got successive outs by Jeff Kent, which scored Javier, and Joe Carter to end the game 5‚Äì3 for the Cubs. Aftermath Chicago's win clinched the team's 15th postseason berth in franchise history and their first since 1989. The Cubs' presence in the postseason led several sportswriters to reference the Curse of the Billy Goat and the difficulties the Cubs' had faced since 1945. The Billy Goat story suggests that Billy Sianis cursed the Cubs after he and his goat were asked to leave game four of the 1945 World Series. The playoff berth matched the Cubs with the Atlanta Braves in the NLDS, where the Cubs were swept 3 games to 0. The Cubs would have to wait another 18 years to win the National League pennant and World Series in 2016, their first NL pennant since 1945, and their first title since 1908. In baseball statistics tie-breakers count as regular season games, with all events in them added to regular season statistics. For example, the Chicago Sun-Times noted that Sammy Sosa could have added to his notable home run total in the game. Sosa did add to his league-leading strikeout total with one in the 4th inning. Beck also added to his league- leading total in games played and earned his 51st save of the season which finished 2nd to Trevor Hoffman's 53 but is tied for the 9th highest single- season save total in MLB history. Several Cubs and Giants won awards for their regular season performances including Rookie of the Year honors for Kerry Wood, a Silver Slugger Award for Sosa, and a Rawlings Gold Glove Award for J. T. Snow. Sosa also won the Most Valuable Player award, earning 30 out of 32 first place votes (with McGwire taking the remaining 2). Barry Bonds drew criticism after the game for his poor performance, including twice making an out with the bases loaded, with some suggesting that Bonds often played poorly in \\"big games\\". Bonds' 0‚Äì4 performance with an RBI and a strikeout earned him a ‚àí.186 win probability added (WPA), the lowest figure for any player in the game. WPA is a statistic which takes the game situation into account to quantify how a player altered his team's chances of winning. Bonds' figure translates into decreasing the Giants' chances of success by 18.6%. The book Game of Shadows, which details Bonds' suggested use of performance-enhancing drugs (PED), argues that Bonds grew jealous and resentful of the attention Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa were given during their record chase. As a result, according to Game of Shadows, Bonds turned to weight training under Greg Anderson who began providing him with steroids and other PEDs following the 1998 season.

US 6 is the second longest federal highway in the United States, second only to U.S. Route 20. In Ohio, the road runs west-east from the Indiana state line near Edgerton to the Pennsylvania state line near Andover. The that lie in Ohio are maintained by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT). US 6 serves the major cities of Sandusky, Lorain, and Cleveland. The highway is also called the Grand Army of the Republic Highway to honor the Union forces of the American Civil War. The alternate name was designated in 1953. US 6 originally ran from Massachusetts to Pennsylvania. It was extended through Ohio to Colorado in June 1931. The route of US 6 has remained largely unchanged since 1931. Route description US 6 traverses the far northern portion of Ohio, passing through 10 counties. The highway travels through largely farm and field country until it reaches Sandusky. After Sandusky, US 6 travels along the coast of Lake Erie until Cleveland. From Cleveland to the Pennsylvania state line, Route 6 passes through mostly wooded land. =Western Ohio= US 6 crosses into Williams County, Ohio, at the Indiana state line between Butler, Indiana, and Edgerton, Ohio. The highway goes east from the border, passing through the small town of Edgerton, where it has a brief concurrency with Ohio State Route 49. Continuing east through farm country, US 6 passes through Ridgeville Corners, until reaching Napoleon in Henry County, where it intersects US 24, starting a 4.6-mile long concurrency. East of Napoleon, US 6 passes through McClure. 15 miles east of McClure, Route 6 passes south of the college town of Bowling Green, intersecting with Interstate 75. Along this 15-mile stretch, the road crosses into Wood County. Just east of Bowling Green, US 6 has a 1-mile long overlap with Ohio State Route 199. US 6 continues through rural country until it passes just north of Bradner. Here, the highway intersects U.S. Route 23 at the Wood-Sandusky county line. In Sandusky County, US 6 passes through the small towns of Rollersville and Helena before reaching the city of Fremont. In Fremont, US 6 overlaps with Ohio State Route 53 for 4.1 miles, US 20 for 3.9 miles, and Ohio State Route 19 for 2.6 miles. Route 6 skirts the northern city limits of Fremont before turning northeast just east of Fremont. 3 miles from Fremont, US 6 crosses under I-80/I-90, but there is not an interchange between the highways. 11 miles northeast of the interstate, US 6 crosses into Erie County. Charles Berry Bridge over the Black River in Lorain Just into Erie County, US 6 overlaps Ohio State Route 269 for 0.6 miles, then intersects Ohio State Route 2 1.8 miles east of the SR 269 concurrency. Just east of this intersection, US 6 enters the city of Sandusky. US 6 passes through a largely residential part of Sandusky. Locally, the highway is also known as Tiffin Avenue, West Washington Street, Warren Street, and Cleveland Road West. Cedar Point is accessed from US 6. Southeast of Sandusky, US 6 passes the Griffing Sandusky Airport near Fairview Lanes. As US 6 continues east through Erie County, it passes through the city of Huron, the communities of Mitiwanga and Beulah Beach, and the city of Vermilion before crossing into Lorain County. East of Vermilion, in Lorain County, US 6 enters the city of Lorain, the last major city before the highway reaches Cleveland. In Lorain, Route 6 stays close to the Lake Erie shoreline and crosses the Black River on the Charles Berry Bridge, the second-largest bascule bridge in the world. East of Lorain, US 6 passes through Sheffield Lake and Avon Lake before crossing into Cuyahoga County. =Cleveland= After passing through Bay Village, US 6 enters the suburbs of Cleveland. In Rocky River, US 6 starts concurrencies with Ohio State Route 2 and U.S. Route 20. Also, an alternate route of US 6 starts in Rocky River and winds along Detroit Avenue for 7.3 miles to its eastern terminus just west of the Cuyahoga River in the Ohio City neighborhood. US 6 enters the city of Cleveland during its overlap with SR 2 and US 20. US 6, along with US 20, splits from SR 2 just before it crosses the Cuyahoga River on the Main Avenue Bridge. Route 6 meets up with Ohio State Route 3 and U.S. Route 42 at West 25th Street, and the four highways (US 6, US 20, US 42, SR 3) cross the Cuyahoga River on the Veterans Memorial Bridge. At the east end of the bridge, US 6 passes through Public Square. Here, the concurrencies with US 20, US 42, and SR 3 end. U.S. Route 322 also starts a concurrency with US 6 in Public Square that ends 0.5 mi east of the plaza East of Public Square, US 6 has an interchange with Interstate 90. 4.5 miles east of this intersection, US 6 starts another concurrency with US 20 in East Cleveland that lasts for 4.2 miles. After splitting from US 20, US 6 runs concurrent with Ohio State Route 84 for 2.1 miles before entering Lake County. =Eastern Ohio= The 10.23 miles that lie within Lake County pass through many small residential developments in Willoughby Hills and Kirtland before crossing into Geauga County. In Geauga County, US 6 passes through the city of Chardon, where it has a brief overlap with Ohio State Route 44. In Chardon, US 6 turns northeast to serve Hambden Township and Montville Township before crossing into Ashtabula County. In Ashtabula County, US 6 travels straight east through the townships of Hartsgrove, Rome, New Lyme, and Cherry Valley, as well as the village of Andover before turning north with Ohio State Route 7. 7.5 miles north of Andover, US 6 breaks its concurrency with SR 7, turns east, and enters Pennsylvania in Crawford County, just north of the Pymatuning Reservoir. State Route 174 in Willoughby Hills, Lake County History US 6 was one of the original routes created when the United States Numbered Highway System was formed. Originally, US 6 was only routed from Provincetown, Massachusetts to Brewster, New York. Soon after, it was routed to Pennsylvania and was alternatively named the Roosevelt Highway. The route was not extended into Ohio until 1931, when the highway was expanded to Greeley, Colorado. The Ohio routing established in 1931 has not been changed since then. By the 1930s, the Roosevelt Highway name had started to fade. Major William Anderson, Jr. took notice of this and proposed the idea of redesignating the highway to honor Union forces during the Civil War. Veteran associations started promoting the idea in 1934. Because each state along the highway owned its portion of US 6, each state had to act on the proposal. Each state had approved the renaming by 1953, and it was in that year that US 6 was designated as the Grand Army of the Republic Highway along its entire length. The name is signed in all 14 states that US 6 passes through.

Plot summary  Gracey and her friend Angela are spending their last holidays in Cunningham with her brothers Dougy and Raymond. They attend school in Australia and are visiting where Gracey's family have moved. Gracey is uncomfortable and embarrassed by her family while Raymond is enjoying the visit. While playing in some trenches Dougy comes across some bones which appear to him to be human like. At Gracey's suggestion he, Gracey and Angela take them to the police where the bones are taken away from him. The police investigate and discover more bones. Back in Brisbane, Gracey's English teacher gives Gracey a few books on aboriginal history and deaths. Gracey is at first disinterested as she wants to fit in and be a part of the 'white community', but further research reveals the origin of the bones Dougy found. Gracey returns to Cunningham when her mother dies and a series of violent and tragic incidents cause Gracey to reassess her outlook. The story is narrated by Gracey and Dougy.  Themes  * Interpersonal relationships : Gracey prefers her white friend Angela and is embarrassed by her black family and their seeming hopelessness. She lacks a closeness with her brothers Dougy and Raymond, her mother and their community * Identity : Gracey feels more at home with her white friends and the community in Brisbane.

It was played at Cinergy Field in Cincinnati, on October 4, 1999. The Mets won the game, 5‚Äì0, with starting pitcher Al Leiter pitching a two-hit shutout. As a result, the Mets qualified for the postseason and the Reds did not. The game was necessary after both teams finished the season with identical win‚Äìloss records of 96‚Äì66. Some described the Mets as collapsing late in the season while the race between the Reds and their division rival Houston Astros was close enough to create the possibility of a three-way tie. The Reds won a coin flip late in the season which, by rule at the time, awarded them home field for the game. Upon winning, the Mets advanced to NL Division Series (NLDS) where they defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks, 3 games to 1. They then advanced to the NL Championship Series (NLCS) but were defeated by the Atlanta Braves, 4 games to 2. This game counted as the 163rd regular-season game by both teams, with all events in the game added to regular-season statistics. Background The Mets spent 34 days of the 1999 season leading the NL East Division, but‚Äîfollowing a seven-game losing streak from September 21‚Äì28 along with an eight-game winning streak by their division rival Atlanta Braves from September 19‚Äì28 ‚Äî the Braves took a commanding 8-game lead in the division that they did not relinquish. Meanwhile, the Reds and Houston Astros were in a close race for the NL Central division. The Astros led the division for much of the season, but did not lead by more than three games after August 1 except for one day. Ultimately, the Astros won the division with a 97‚Äì65 record, one game ahead of the 96‚Äì66 Reds. The Astros won their 97th game on the final day of the season. If Houston had not won that game, the Astros, Reds, and Mets would have instead been in a three-way tie for both the NL Central and the wild card spot. Bob Costas suggested that MLB was lucky to avoid this situation as he believed they had \\"no reasonable tiebreaker\\" to deal with it. Had this three-way tie arisen, the Mets would have won the wild card while the Astros and Reds would have played a tie- breaker for the Central division title (as the tiebreaker counts as a regular season game, the Reds/Astros loser would have moved to 96‚Äì67, game worse than the Mets). The Mets' losing streak late in the season led Jayson Stark to label them a \\"sinking ship\\" in a column on September 30. However, the Mets broke this streak with a win over the Braves and dominant pitcher Greg Maddux and then, following a loss, swept three games from the Pittsburgh Pirates to end the season, tying the Reds' 96‚Äì66 record. The New York Daily News described this late-season performance as an \\"agonizing roller coaster ride\\" for Mets fans. With the Mets and Reds holding the best non-division winning records in the league a tie-breaker was necessary to determine the wild-card winner. Bob Costas said at the time he did not like the wild-card system as he believed it \\"diminishes the drama and authenticity of a pennant race\\", although he approved of the playoff teams in 1999. Tim McCarver disagreed, arguing that the late-season race between the Mets, Astros, and Reds showed the excitement a wild card can add to the season. A coin flip conducted earlier that September set Cincinnati's Cinergy Field as the location for the tie-breaker game. Game summary Rickey Henderson led off the game with a single, scored the game's first run, and hit a home run in the fifth inning. The Mets took a quick 2‚Äì0 lead with a single by Rickey Henderson to open the game followed immediately by a home run by Edgardo Alfonzo. They added to this lead in the third as Alfonzo drew a walk and then John Olerud hit a double which advanced Alfonzo to third base. Reds starter Steve Parris intentionally walked Mike Piazza to load the bases and was relieved by Denny Neagle. However, Neagle then walked Robin Ventura to score Alfonzo and extend the lead to 3‚Äì0. Neagle remained in the game and yielded a home run to Henderson to lead off the fifth inning for the fourth run. Neagle then loaded the bases with two outs with walks to Piazza and Ventura followed by a Darryl Hamilton single, but escaped the inning without further scoring. The Reds pinch hit for Neagle in the bottom of the fifth, and Danny Graves entered for them to pitch the sixth inning. Graves walked Rey Ord√≥√±ez to leadoff the inning, Mets starter Al Leiter sacrifice bunted Ord√≥√±ez to second, and following an out he scored on a double by Alfonzo. Graves remained in the game until Mark Lewis pinch hit for him in the eighth and Dennys Reyes relieved him in the ninth. Graves and Reyes held the score steady after the sixth but the Reds' offense did not score against Al Leiter and the Mets won the game, and with it the Wild Card, 5‚Äì0. Al Leiter pitched a complete game shutout, scattering two hits and four walks across the nine inning start. This was Leiter's first complete game of the season. Pokey Reese was the only Reds player to reach scoring position for the entire game, doubling to lead off the bottom of the ninth inning and then advancing to third on a ground out. The Bergen Record labeled Leiter the Mets' \\"flag bearer\\", coming through in games such as this when the team needed him most. For example, Leiter had also defeated Greg Maddux in his previous start on September 29 to snap the Mets' seven-game losing streak. Leiter's earned run average in the second half of the 1999 season was 1.22 runs lower than in the first. Leiter's start earned an 86 game score, which tied for the 14th best total in the National League that season. Aftermath New York's win clinched the team's fifth postseason berth in franchise history, their first since losing in the 1988 National League Championship Series. The playoff berth made the Mets the second team in MLB history to make the playoffs after being two games back of the leader with three games left to play in the season. The Mets defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NLDS, 3 games to 1. This win advanced the Mets to the NLCS where they lost to the Atlanta Braves, 4 games to 2. The Mets performance in the playoffs drew heavy television viewership, with the decisive game of the NLCS scoring the highest ratings for any League Championship Series broadcast since 1993. Overall the NLCS averaged 10.9 million viewers, 18% higher than the NLCS had drawn the year before. Variety writer Tom Bierbaum argued this was a good sign for the future of baseball because the Mets and Boston Red Sox had drawn younger viewers during their time in the postseason. Bierbaum believed that baseball needed fresh teams, not just the often-successful Yankees and Braves, to draw new audiences and grow viewership. In baseball statistics tie-breakers count as regular season games, with all events in them added to regular season statistics. For example, Mike Piazza grounded into his 27th double play of the season in the 9th inning, adding to his league-leading total. Similarly, Leiter's performance advanced his position on several 1999 statistical leaderboards including shutouts and walks issued. Reese, Ventura, and Ord√≥√±ez won Rawlings Gold Glove Awards for the season while Piazza and Alfonzo won Silver Sluggers. Robin Ventura also finished sixth in Most Valuable Player voting, with Chipper Jones taking the award. This game marked the only time the Reds were shut out between April 1999 and May 2001, a span of 349 games. After this game, the Reds would go the entire 2000 season without getting shut out, becoming only the second team in MLB history to do so (joining the 1932 New York Yankees). They would extend their streak of scoring a run in every game into the 2001 season for a total of 207 games, the second longest such streak in MLB history. Had this game not counted as a regular season game, the Reds would have scored a run in 348 straight games, which would have been the longest streak in MLB history. The New York Yankees also made the playoffs in 1999, eventually advancing to the 1999 World Series where they swept the Braves. The 1999 season marked the first time both of the current New York City-based MLB teams, the Mets and Yankees qualified for the playoffs together in the same season. Prior to the Mets' elimination, Mike Lupica noted the possibility of a \\"Subway Series\\", a term for a World Series played between two New York-based teams. The 1956 World Series between the Yankees and then- Brooklyn Dodgers was the last such Series. Yankees pitcher David Cone told Lupica \\"I want a Subway Series, for selfish reasons. I want to play in one.\\" Although the Mets failed to make the Series in 1999 the two met the following year in the 2000 World Series where the Yankees won, 4 games to 1. After their 2000 World Series appearance, the Mets did not make the playoffs again until 2006. Meanwhile, the Reds did not place in the top two of their division until 2010. Jack McKeon managed the Reds from 1998‚Äì2000 and was fired after the 2000 season when the team finished 10 games back of the division leading Cardinals.

BootX is used to prepare the computer for use, by loading all required device drivers and then starting-up Mac OS X by booting the kernel on all PowerPC Macintoshes running the Mac OS X 10.2 operating system or later versions. Using BootROM, a read-only memory (ROM) computer chip containing OpenFirmware, a graphical bootsplash is shown briefly on all compatible Macintosh computers as a grey Apple logo with a spinning cursor that appears during the startup sequence. The program is freely available as part of the Darwin operating system under the open-source Apple Public Source License. BootX was superseded by another nearly identical bootloader named \`boot.efi\` and an Extensible Firmware Interface ROM on the release of the Intel-based Mac.  History  left left Older Macintoshes dating from 1983 until 1998 utilized a basic bootloader; the bootloader was solely a ROM chip varying in sizes up to 4 megabytes (MB), which contained both the computer code to boot the computer and to run the Mac OS operating system. This was known as the Macintosh Toolbox, or the Old World ROM, and differs greatly from the design of the modern Macintosh, which generally use a hard drive of large capacity to store the operating system. This bootloader was used in all Macintosh computers until mid-1998. With the advent of the iMac series of Macintoshes, the firmware was updated. The ROM was reduced in size to 1 MB, called BootROM, and the remainder of the ROM was moved to the file \`Mac OS ROM\` in the Mac OS System Folder, stored on the hard drive. This ROM used a full implementation of the OpenFirmware standard (contained in BootROM) and was named the New World ROM. In 2001, with the release of Mac OS X 10.0, the \`Mac OS ROM\` file was replaced with the \`BootX\` bootloader file. In 2002, with the release of Mac OS X 10.2, the historical \\"Happy Mac\\" start- up picture was replaced with a grey apple logo. By introducing the Intel Mac in 2006, BootROM was replaced by the near identical Extensible Firmware Interface ROM (although Apple still calls it BootROM) and the \`boot.efi\` file.  Features  To make the boot loader appealing to other operating system developers, Apple added features to allow flexibility in the booting process such as network boot using TFTP and load Mach-O and ELF formatted kernels. BootX can also boot from HFS, HFS+, UFS and ext2 formatted volumes. The boot loader can be manipulated at startup by holding down various key combinations to alter the booting process. Such functions include Verbose Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and V key at startup, which replaces the default Apple logo with text-based information on the boot process and Single User Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and S, which, depending on the operating system, may boot into a more basic command-line or text-based version of the operating system, to facilitate maintenance and recovery action. The ROM can also be set to require a password to access these technical functions using the OpenFirmware interface.  Boot process  Mac OS X booting up in single-user mode In PowerPC-based Macintoshes, the boot process starts with the activation of BootROM, the basic Macintosh ROM, which performs a Power On Self Test to test hardware essential to startup. On the passing of this test, the startup chime is played and control of the computer is passed to OpenFirmware. OpenFirmware initializes the Random Access Memory, Memory Management Unit and hardware necessary for the ROM's operation. The OpenFirmware then checks settings, stored in NVRAM, and builds a list of all devices on a device tree by gathering their stored FCode information. On the completion of this task, BootX takes over the startup process configuring the keyboard and display, claiming and reserving memory for various purposes and checking to see if various key combinations are being pressed. After this process has been completed BootX displays the grey Apple logo, spins the spinning wait cursor, and proceeds to load the kernel and some kernel extensions and start the kernel.

Jorden studied at Yale University, receiving a bachelor's degree in international relations in 1947. His university studies were punctuated by service in the Army during World War II, during which he learned Japanese at Yale and the University of Michigan. He received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University in 1948. On completion of his studies, he worked for the New York Herald Tribune, the Associated Press and, from 1952, The New York Times. He covered the Far East for the early part of his journalism career, including assignments in Japan and Korea. Later, he was Moscow bureau chief for The Times. His marriage to linguist Eleanor Harz ended in divorce. He was a member of the team that won the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting in 1958. In 1961, two years after returning to Washington, he left The Times to join the State Department. By the mid-1960s, he was involved in the State Department's Vietnam policy. After a series of diplomatic and national security positions (as well as taking time from government to assist president Lyndon B. Johnson with his memoirs), he was appointed by president Richard M Nixon to the position of ambassador to Panama in 1974, where he played an instrumental role in negotiating the Torrijos- Carter Treaties that returned ownership of the Panama Canal to Panama. As outgoing ambassador in 1978, he was sent to garner regional support for mediation regarding the Nicaraguan political crisis of the Somoza regime, successfully convincing Somoza to accept mediation. After government service, Jorden served as scholar in residence at the Lyndon B. Johnson Library. In 1984, he published \\"Panama Odyssey\\", a comprehensive study of the Panama Canal Treaty negotiations, to wide critical acclaim. He was consulted as an expert commentator by several news organizations prior to and following the United States invasion of Panama.

It was the threatened nominate subspecies of the western corella.Anon. (2007). Muir‚Äôs Corella. (Fauna Note No.4). Department of Environment and Conservation, Western Australia. It was removed from the WA's threatened species list in November 2012 as a result of successful conservation efforts.May (2012). Cockatoo, contentious moth back from brink. Herald Sun Description Muir's corella has mainly white plumage with an erectile white crest. The undersides of the wings and tail are yellow. The feathers between the eye and beak are deep salmon-pink, as are the bases of the feathers on the head and underparts. The eye is surrounded by a broad grey-blue eye-ring. The white feathers are often stained with soil because of the birds‚Äô foraging activities. The corellas have a wingspan of 90 cm, and range from 43‚Äì48 cm in length and 560‚Äì815 g in weight. They have a variety of loud and raucous calls. They are very similar in appearance to Butler's corella, the only other subspecies of the western corella, being slightly larger with a longer upper mandible. Distribution and habitat Muir's corella formerly inhabited woodlands and open country east of the main area of forest in south-western Western Australia, occurring north to the Swan and Avon Rivers, south to Albany and Augusta, and eastwards to the Stirling and Porongurup Ranges. The birds were distributed in small, widely separated colonies throughout this range. However, the population has declined and the subspecies now only occurs in the Lake Muir region where the remainder of the woodland habitat consists of fragmented remnants. Behaviour Muir's corellas are gregarious and may be seen in flocks of ten to a thousand birds. They have traditional roosting sites, usually in dense timber, which they leave in the morning for their feeding areas and return to at night. =Feeding= The corellas forage on the ground in large flocks and feed on a wide variety of seeds of both native and introduced plants, as well as corms and tubers which they dig up using the elongated upper mandibles of their bills. Cereal grains, including oats, barley and wheat, are eaten extensively in summer and autumn, while the corms of onion grass are important in winter and spring. =Breeding= The corellas nest in tree hollows of large, mature eucalypts, including jarrah and marri. Eggs are laid from September to November with a clutch size of 1‚Äì3. The incubation period lasts 26‚Äì29 days until fledging. During the breeding season the birds feed close to the nest tree. After fledging, the young birds and their parents join other family groups to form large flocks that disperse to summer feeding areas. At the end of summer, breeding adults return to their nest sites while immature birds form nomadic flocks. Status and conservation Muir's corella is considered to be threatened because it consists of one relatively small and isolated population covering a fragmented range of about 3000 km2, with the actual area of occupancy being about 500 km2. It is listed as Vulnerable under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.Australian Government, Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts - Species Profile and Threats Database: Cacatua pastinator pastinator. Population estimates vary; it may comprise up to 9000 individuals, including only about 2500 mature birds,Garnett, Stephen T.; & Crowley, Gabriel M. (2000). The Action Plan for Australian Birds 2000. Environment Australia: Canberra. having gradually recovered from a low of about 100 individuals in the 1940s after widespread shooting and poisoning in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.Muir‚Äôs Corella: conserving a threatened species. Australian Government and South West Catchments Council. Average life expectancy of adults has been estimated at 17 years for males and 14 years for females, with most young birds dying before they reach breeding age of 3‚Äì5 years old. While current nest hollow and food availability are sufficient to sustain the population, changes in land use may threaten the corella where remnant vegetation and paddock trees are cleared to establish plantations of blue gum and other species. It is potentially threatened by competition from, and interbreeding with, a species introduced from south-eastern Australia, the closely related long-billed corella, which has nearby populations established from avicultural escapes and releases. Other threats include illegal shooting and poisoning, as well as competition for nest hollows with feral honey bees. Because the corellas sometimes cause damage to crops, young trees, gardens, power lines and house fittings, the subspecies is a declared pest of agriculture. However, because it is listed as ‚Äòrare or likely to become extinct‚Äô, it is illegal to destroy them, and damage mitigation measures must use non-lethal means.

He was born in L'Islet, Quebec, the son of Captain Thomas Bernier and C√©linas Paradis.Captain Joseph Elz√©ar Bernier, The Quebec History Encyclopedia At the age of 14, he became a cabin boy on his father's ship. Three years later, he became captain of his own ship and commanded sailing ships for the next 25 years. Bernier was named governor for the jail at Quebec City in 1895. From 1904 to 1911, he explored the Arctic archipelago on annual voyages in his ship the CGS Arctic and officially claimed the islands for Canada. Bernier retrieved documents that had been stored in caches by earlier Arctic explorers. He also established Royal Canadian Mounted Police posts in the Canadian north. During World War I, Bernier commanded a ship which transported mail along the eastern coast and carried goods in convoys across the Atlantic. He returned to patrolling the arctic after the war's end, continuing until his retirement in 1925, when he was awarded the Royal Geographical Society's Back Award. Historian and expert on Northern Sovereignty Michael Byers noted that Bernier placed a plaque on Melville Island, in 1909, claiming Canadian Sovereignty over not only the entire Arctic Archipelago, but a wedge of the Arctic Ocean \\"from longitude 60¬∞W to 141¬∞W up to latitude 90¬∞N,\\" ie, all the way to the North Pole. Byer characterized this claim as an articulation of sector theory, and noted how diplomats had widely rejected Russia's claims to a wedge of the Arctic, extending to the North Pole. Bernier died of a heart attack in L√©vis at the age of 82. He published Master Mariner and Explorer: A Narrative of Sixty Years at Sea ... in 1939. Joseph Idlout's daughter, Leah Idlout, has said that her father was the son of Bernier.

His wife, Fok Sum Yi, did not accept the ruling, and disappeared later that evening, leaving behind a letter with the lyrics of Old Black Joe written on it. The series flashed back to the 80s. It was revealed that Fok Sum Yi came from a wealthy family that later lost all its wealth in a stock market crash. Sum Yi‚Äôs father commits suicide after losing his fortune. In order to support her siblings, Sum Yi became a television actress. However, she endured many hardships and humiliation and never attained true success in the field. She eventually reunites with her first love Cheung Hock Yu. Sum Yi and Hock Yu marry despite objections from Hock Yu‚Äôs family. Through wit and manipulation, Sum Yi was able to win the Cheung family over, and climbed the corporate ladder to become one of the key figures in the Cheung‚Äôs family business. While Sum Yi gained wealth and power, the romance between her and her husband faded, and she also made many enemies in the business world, which led to Hock Yu's kidnapping. Police caught the kidnapper and the kidnapper stated how Hock Yu attempted to escape with a gunshot wound and fell off a cliff. This made Sum Yi believe that if she didn‚Äôt prolong the money exchanging process and gave the money right away, Hock Yu wouldn‚Äôt have to go through so much pain. As the police didn‚Äôt find Hock Yu‚Äôs body, just his blood-stained shirt, they suggested that Hock Yu's body might have been eaten by animals, or washed away due to heavy rain. Sum Yi refuses to believe her husband is dead until a body is found. Eventually, rivals within the Cheung family had Hock Yu declared dead, so that his fortunes can be distributed. The Cheung family was happy that Sum Yi was left out of the will. However, a provision in the will left Hock Yu's entire fortune to Sum Yi, if she can prove she still has her wedding ring in her possession. Stunned to see Sum Yi still holding on to the ring as a necklace, she was able to inherited Hock Yu's massive fortunes. Just as she inherited the wealth, she disappeared from the Cheung residence, and returned to her childhood playhouse to rediscover her childhood memories. She looked at the beautiful scenery and enjoys the peace. Suddenly she hears a knock. Shocked and stunned to see who was at the door, she cried as she is reunited with her husband.

It is spoken in the Dutch province Gelderland. However, it is quite rare to come across a native speaker of \\"Oost-Veluws\\", as few people actually still speak this dialect. Delimitation of Oost-Veluws Oost-Veluws is spoken in places such as the municipalities Elburg en Oldebroek, Epe, Vaassen, Apeldoorn en Dieren. The villages Elspeet, Uddel en Kootwijk in the middle of the Veluwe belong to West-Veluws.http://taal.phileon.nl/kaart/nedersaksisch.php The delimitation to Sallaans is problematic to the point that some linguists prefer to make a division between Veluws (consisting of West-Veluws and some Oost-Veluws places as Elburg and Oldebroek) and Sallaans (consisting of Sallaans and the rest of the Oost-Veluws region).http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/weij005nede01/weij005nede01ill45.gif  Differences to other dialect groups  Differences to West-Veluws = Most villages of the area called Veluwe lie on its borders, that is, not in the middle of this sandy woodland. The actual Veluwe is a very sparsely populated area that was rather inaccessible in earlier days. Therefore, it is not surprising that two very important isoglosses have come to lie within the Veluwe. The first isogloss is the border between old and olt on the Eastern side and the vocalization of l as in oud or out in the West. The retaining of ol is typical for Low German, while its replacement by ou is characteristic for Low Frankish. The second isogloss pertains to the plural inflection of verbs. In most West Low German dialects, the plural inflection for all person forms is t: wiele warkt, ule warkt, zie warkt - 'we work, you work, they work'. West-Veluws has a unified plural inflection as well, but on -en as in Dutch. But in the South and East of the Veluwe, -t is restricted to the second and third person plural, while the first person takes -en. In the variety of Apeldoorn, for example, it is wiele warken, ule warkt, zie warkt. There are also some lexical differences. For example, Oost-Veluws has ledder 'ladder', while in West-Veluws the form leer is used which is probably a loan from 17th century Hollandic. This process during which characteristics of Hollandic were adopted in places at the shore of the Zuiderzee, while the IJssel region retained the Low German forms holds also for the two isoglosses cited above. =Differences to Achterhoeks= But the intensive influence of Hollandic can be observed in Oost-Veluws as well as can be seen when comparing it to Achterhoeks dialect which lies in the East of the Veluwe. E.g. Achterhoeks good, beer, while Dutch and Veluws goed, bier. Germanic long √¥ as in *gr√¥naz 'green becomes uu, thus gruun, in comparison to Achterhoeks greun. Here, Oost- Veluws patterns with Sallaans. Dutch ui usually corresponds to Oost-Veluws uu, while (eastern) Achterhoeks has oe. In all of Sallaans and western Achterhoeks (as in Zutphens), lexical diffusion takes place, and words like huus/huis 'house' and moes/muis 'mouse' can both be heard.

The lack of unity or non-unity (of invention), can appear either a priori, i.e., before taking into account the prior art, or a posteriori, i.e., after taking into account the prior art. An a posteriori lack of unity usually results from a lack of novelty or inventive step of the subject-matter of one independent claim.  Unity amongst a group of inventions When a European patent application claims a group of inventions, \\"unity of invention\\" is considered present if \\"...there is a technical relationship among those inventions involving one or more of the same or corresponding special technical features.\\"  Search phase  If, when carrying out a search, the search division considers that the application lacks unity (i.e., it doesn't meet the provisions of Article 82), a partial search report is established. The EPO then requires one or more further search fees for the other identified inventions, or groups of inventions, that the search may cover. The former time limit for paying the further search fees was a period the EPO specified as between two weeks and six weeks. Under new Rule 64 EPC, in force as of April 1, 2010, Decision of the Administrative Council of 25 March 2009 amending the Implementing Regulations to the European Patent Convention (CA/D 3/09), Article 2(1). the time limit for the further search fees is now two months.

Therefore, the findings of the search division‚Äîthat the application lacks unity‚Äîmay be contested before the examining division, during the examination phase. If successful, and if further search fees were paid during the search phase, the further search fees may be refunded. If successful, and if further search fees had not been paid during the search phase, \\"...the applicant is entitled as of right to have the whole subject-matter of his unitary invention searched.\\"Decision T 1285/11 of the Technical Board of Appeal 3.3.01 of 15 December 2011, Reasons for the Decision, 3.1, 5th paragraph.  Examination phase  Under the former version of Rule 36 EPC, an objection of lack of unity of invention raised in a communication of the Examining Division could trigger a 24-month period for filing a divisional application, if the particular objection was raised for the first time. However, under the amended version of Rule 36 EPC which came into effect in April 2014, divisional applications can be filed at any time provided that the parent European application is still pending.

The war began as an uprising by Prussian cities and local nobility to win independence from the Teutonic Knights. In 1454 Casimir IV married Elisabeth of Habsburg and the Prussian Confederation asked Poland's King Casimir IV Jagiellon for help and offered to accept the king as protector instead of the Teutonic Order. When the King assented, war broke out between supporters of the Prussian Confederation, backed by Poland, and backers of government by the Teutonic Knights. The Thirteen Years' War ended in the victory of the Prussian Confederation and Poland and in the Second Peace of Thorn (1466). This was soon followed by the War of the Priests (1467‚Äì1479), a drawn-out dispute over the independence of the Prussian Prince-Bishopric of Warmia (Ermland), in which the Knights also sought revision of the Peace of Thorn.  Background  Reasons for war = A dispute between Poland and the Teutonic Order over control of Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania had lasted since the 1308 Teutonic takeover of Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk), when the territory was contested and annexed by the Teutonic Order. This event resulted in a series of Polish‚ÄìTeutonic Wars throughout the 14th and 15th centuries. In the 15th century, the towns of Prussia rapidly grew economically. However, this was not followed by an increase in their political influence. The rule of the Teutonic Knights was seen as more and more anachronistic -- taxes (customs) and the system of grain licenses (every trader had to pay large fees for the privilege of trading grain) were hindering economic development in the province. At the same time the nobility wanted a larger say in the running of the country and were looking enviously at neighbouring Poland, where the Polish nobility enjoyed wider privileges. The Knights were also accused of violating the few existing privileges of the nobility and the cities. Craftsmen were discontented because of competition from so-called partacze, or artisans settled by the Knights near their castles. Kashubians, Poles, Germans, and Prussians were slowly melting into one nation, and as national differences disappeared, the common goals of all the ethnic and social groups of Prussia became more prominent, and the Prussian estates leaned increasingly towards Poland. Teutonic Order In 1397 Prussian knights had founded a secret organisation called the Eidechsenbund (English translation: Lizard Union), more or less against the Teutonic Knights, but that organization had failed as it was not supported by the urban population. After the victory by the Polish and Lithuanian forces at Gr√ºnfelde near Tannenberg (the Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg)) during the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìTeutonic War (1409‚Äì1411), the Prussian estates eagerly pledged allegiance to King W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço (Jogaila) of Poland. But they quickly returned to the order's rule after the Poles were unable to conquer Marienburg (Malbork). A clause in the peace treaty stated that it was guaranteed by the Prussian states, which would gain the right to defy the Teutonic Order if it broke the treaty. In the succeeding wars the Prussian estates opposed any conflict, and pushed the Grand Masters of the Teutonic Knights to make peace. On February 21, 1440, a group made up of individuals from the Prussian cities, nobility, and clergy, formed the Prussian Confederation. The main contributors were from the nobility of Culmerland (Che≈Çmno Land), Thorn, Culm (Che≈Çmno), and from the Hanseatic cities of Elbing (ElblƒÖg) and Danzig. Grand Master Paul von Rusdorf was seen to approve the existence of the confederacy, but his successor, Konrad von Erlichshausen, opposed it. His non-compromising policy was followed and intensified by Ludwig von Erlichshausen who took that office in 1449 or 1450. = 1452-1454 negotiations = In 1452, the Prussian Confederation asked Emperor Frederick III for mediation in their conflict with the Teutonic Order. Disagreeing with the confederacy, Frederick banned it and ordered it to obey the Teutonic Order on 5 December 1453. Faced with that situation the Prussians sent envoys to Poland ‚Äî although the Prussian Confederation, under the influence of Thorn and the Pomeranian and Culmerland nobility, had already sought contact with the Poles. They received support, especially from Greater Poland and from the party of Queen Sophia of Halshany, mother of King Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland. The Bishop of Krak√≥w, Zbigniew Ole≈õnicki, opposed this support and tried to prevent war. Prussian Confederation offered to incorporate Prussia into the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, 1454, Central Archives of Historical Records, Warsaw In January 1454, the year that Casimir IV was married to Elisabeth Habsburg, the Prussian faction asked Casimir IV and protection by the Kingdom of Poland. Casimir asked the Prussian Confederation for a more formal petition. On 4 February 1454, the Secret Council of the Prussian Confederation sent a formal act of disobedience to the Grand Master. Two days later the confederacy started its rebellion and soon almost all Prussia, except for Marienburg, Stuhm (Sztum), and Konitz (Chojnice), were free from Teutonic rule. Most of the captured Ordensburg castles were immediately destroyed. On 10 February 1454, the confederacy sent an official delegation to Poland, headed by Johannes von Baysen. By 20 February, the delegates were in Krak√≥w and asked Casimir to bring Prussia into the Polish kingdom. After negotiating the exact conditions of incorporation, the king agreed and delegates of the Prussian Confederation pledged allegiance to Casimir on 6 March 1454. On the same day, the king agreed to all the conditions of the Prussian delegates -- for instance Thorn demanded the destruction of the Polish city of Nieszawa -- giving wide privileges to the Prussian cities and nobility. Three days later, Johannes von Baysen was named as the first governor of Prussia. After 15 April, most of the Prussian estates, with the exception of the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia, pledged allegiance to their new ruler. Poland sent the Grand Master a declaration of war, predated to 22 February. Both sides expected the war to end quickly. = International situation = In 1454 Poland was in conflict with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which meant that although Casimir IV was Grand Duke of Lithuania as well as King of Poland, Lithuania sent no aid during the war to Poland and, aside from a few ineffective raids, did not participate during the conflict. There was also the threat of attack by the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Elsewhere, the international situation was quite good for Poland, as no outside states were likely to intervene. The southern border of Poland was more or less secure because of the weakness of the Bohemian lands, which resulted from the Hussite Wars. Although the Hanseatic League sympathized with the Prussian cities, the league backed the Teutonic Knights because the order granted them extra privileges. The Livonian Order had problems with Denmark and was unable to help the Teutonic Knights in Prussia. Because of conflict between Sweden and Denmark, both sides stayed more or less neutral in the upcoming conflict. France and England were too weakened after the Hundred Years' War, and England was also embroiled in civil war, the Wars of the Roses. The Duke of Burgundy, Flanders, and the Netherlands, Philip the Good, was more interested in creating an independent Kingdom of Burgundy. Pope Nicholas V's primary concern was dealing with the Ottoman Turks.  Forces of belligerents  The Teutonic state in 1410 The main part of the Polish army of that period was conscripted. All noblemen, when called by the king, had to appear accompanied by their village-mayors and village-administrators. Cities gave wagons with horses, food, and service to them (including escorts). Units were divided into choragwie (standards) of two kinds: family, which were made by very large clans, and land which were from nobles from particular territory. Peasants also participated as infantrymen. The highest command belonged to the king. The total army could amount to 30,000 cavalry. From the beginning of the 15th century, the Polish Crown started to hire mercenaries, who usually fought under the flag of St. George (especially Bohemian (Czech) mercenaries). The flag was either a red cross on white, or a white cross on red; the latter was used only when two Bohemian units met on opposite sides of a battlefield and had to be differentiated. The concept of tabor, learned from the Bohemians, was an important tactic. The Poles had artillery, at first primitive cannons such as bombards. Pistols, or handguns, were used but were ineffective. More important were crossbows, which, when properly used, could cause large losses. The army of the Prussian estates consisted of conscripts and small units provided by cities (around 750 people per unit). In total they could provide about 16,000 soldiers, plus a few thousand armed peasant infantry. They also had more artillery than the Polish army. The Prussian cities were also able to raise a small navy, partially from armed trade ships, partially from hired privateers from other cities. The Teutonic Order in 1454 lost most of its arsenals, but later it was able to raise armies from loyal knights (free Prussians) and peasants. However, most of its forces were hired mercenaries, mainly from Germany and Bohemia.  Overview  First phase = The first land operations from February to August 1454 were carried out by Prussian state conscripts, supported by Czech mercenaries from Moravia and soldiers from Lesser Poland. This force, commanded by Scibor von Baysen (), brother of Johannes von Baysen, tried to besiege the Grand Master Ludwig von Erlichshausen in the city and castle of Marienburg, but without much success due to the professional command of Heinrich Reu√ü von Plauen the Elder, Komtur of Elbing. Casimir IV In the meantime there was some organised support for the Teutonic Order from the German principalities, mainly in Saxony. The reinforcements entered Prussia in the second half of March 1454, from the direction of the Neumark. They were able to take the highly important strategic city of Konitz, which was situated on the important route from Poland to the mouth of the Vistula. Johannes von Baysen moved conscript and mercenary forces there, and they were soon followed by Miko≈Çaj Szarlejski of the Clan of Ostoja, who was the representative of the Polish kingdom and received the title of \\"Supreme Commander of Forces in Prussia\\". In 1454 and 1455, the Teutonic Knights first pawned, then sold the Neumark back to the Margraviate of Brandenburg in the Treaties of C√∂lln and Mewe. At the end of April 1454, the Prussian army started the siege of Konitz; the defence of the city was commanded by Heinrich Reu√ü von Plauen from Greitz. However, Szarlejski lacked any significant commanding skill, his army had not enough artillery, and the Prussian estates were unable to pay their mercenaries, so Konitz was not seriously endangered. After the arrival of Casimir IV, when he received the official oath of allegiance from his new subjects in Elbing and Thorn, he directed to Konitz a pospolite ruszenie (lev√©e en masse) of Polish nobles from Kuyavia, which replaced the unpaid mercenaries. Cavalry forces such as the nobles, however, were ill-suited to the taking of castles, so the situation in Konitz did not change. The king also sent his own units and a lev√©e en masse to lay siege to Marienburg, but Polish forces were unable to take the castle even with Prussian reinforcements, which were relocated to Malbork after taking Stuhm on August 8, 1454. The Teutonic Knights defended themselves skillfully and were able to defeat forces from Danzig in a sudden attack on September 13. The degrading situation of the Polish crown worsened further when in September 1454 a large army of mercenaries under the command of Rudolf, prince of Sagan (≈ªaga≈Ñ), and a Moravian nobleman, the talented soldier Bernhard von Zinnenberg Kriegsreisende.de () arrived in Prussia from the Holy Roman Empire. The army had 9,000 cavalry and 6,000 infantry, plus artillery and many wagons in tabor formations. Battle of Konitz, 1454 Rudolf's army slowly moved to Konitz to rescue it from the Polish siege. It forced Casimir to call a lev√©e en masse of Greater Poland, without the traditional approval of the provincial sejmik. Noblemen, angered by the disruption of the harvest and the unconventional form of the call, massed near the village of Du≈ºa Cerkwica (Cerekwica, Gro√ü Zirkwitz) and demanded from the king several privileges, which were granted in the privilege of Cerekwica on September 14, 1454. Casimir divided his forces into seven large units and the army marched to Konitz, where it was joined by Prussians. On September 18, 1454 the Teutonic Knights defeated the Polish army in the resulting Battle of Konitz. The defeat was a near disaster. The Polish army quickly withdrew from Marienburg, and Stuhm was recovered by the Teutonic Order. They were also able to take other large towns, such as Mewe (Gniew) and Dirschau (Tczew). Impressed by the crusaders' victory, some Prussian lands also capitulated. This was a great victory for the Teutonic Knights, although they lacked enough money to pay the victorious mercenaries. On October 9, the Grand Master promised them that if he could not pay them by February 19, 1455, they would receive all cities, castles, and lands of Prussia, with the rights to sell them. Mercenaries later captured two other cities, Marienwerder (Kwidzyn) and Lessen (≈Åasin), near Marienburg. None of the largest and most important cities of Prussia, such as K√∂nigsberg, surrendered, and they were determined to continue the war. As a result, the Teutonic Order was totally dependent on help from the Holy Roman Empire. To save the situation for Poland, Casimir started hiring more Bohemian and Silesian soldiers and sending them to the cities of Pomerania, Pomesania, and Culmerland. He also decided to call for another lev√©e en masse from the whole Polish kingdom. The lev√©e en masse in Opoka, this time dominated by nobility from Lesser Poland, demanded privileges similar to those given in Cerekwica; the king quickly approved them. Later on from November 11 to November 16, 1454, while under the influence of the aristocracy from Lesser Poland, Casimir changed some of the promises given earlier both in Opoka and Cerekwica through privileges for the whole country given in Nieszawa (the privilege of Nieszawa). This time the Polish army counted almost 3,000 cavalry, plus 3,000 mercenaries. The mercenaries had a few capable commanders, such as Jan Kolda from Zampach and Jan Skalski from the northern Bohemian city of Mal√° Sk√°la (literally, \\"little rock\\") and a member of the family of Valdsztejn, Waldstein, or Wallenstein. This time the Grand Master avoided battle as too risky. The army started the siege of Lessen, whose defense was commanded by the Austrian mercenary Fritz Raweneck. However, the army was unprepared for taking castles, and the large preparations ended with another fiasco. = 1455 to 1460 = The first negotiations between the two sides, conducted from January 9 to January 10, 1455, were unsuccessful. The situation became difficult for Casimir. To pay his mercenaries he had to borrow from the clergy. He decided to give two cities as a fief to Eric II of Pomerania from Stolp (S≈Çupsk), hoping it would secure northern Pomerania. To calm opposition, Casimir later went to Lithuania, where he was forced to stay until the summer of 1455. Eric II, Duke of Pomerania In that situation the Teutonic Knights were able to recover the eastern part of Prussia, including the K√∂nigsberg towns of Altstadt and L√∂benicht on April 17, 1455. They were aided by rebellions in the cities, caused by new large war taxes. The last East Prussian town loyal to the Polish king, Kneiphof, was taken on June 14, 1455 after a long siege by the Teutonic Knights commanded by Heinrich Reuss von Plauen the Elder. The Poles suffered defeat after defeat, and they later also lost Warmia (Ermeland). However, the Grand Master was unable to pay his mercenaries and they took Marienburg, Dirschau, and Eylau (I≈Çawa) in May 1455. Mercenaries under the Bohemian Ulrich Czerwonka (or Oldrzych) immediately started negotiations with Poland to discuss selling the castles. The international situation also became significantly worse. On March 25, Emperor Frederick III banned the Prussian Confederation, forbidding trade with its members. On September 24, 1455, Pope Callixtus III warned that he would excommunicate the Prussian Confederation and all its allies unless they made peace with the Order. In June 1455 the Teutonic Knights gained a new ally, King Christian I of Denmark, who declared war against Poland and the Prussian Confederation. This meant nothing more than a disturbance in trade, however, since Denmark was still busy fighting with Sweden. Christian I of Denmark, King of Denmark, Sweden and Norway Shocked by the loss of Kneiphof, Casimir, in debt and unable to hire new mercenaries, called another lev√©e en masse. The Polish army moved slowly to Thorn, but military actions were halted briefly when the king finally agreed to mediation by Frederick II, Margrave of Brandenburg; all earlier propositions of mediation from different sides had been rejected. The elector, however, failed to negotiate a peace, because the Teutonic Knights, after recent successes, were unwilling to compromise. The Poles suggested that the Teutonic Order should leave Prussia and go elsewhere to fight with pagans; a location suggested earlier by Polish envoys to the Holy Roman Empire was Podolia, near the Tatars. Negotiations ended unsuccessfully on September 26, and the war continued. The new Polish army was larger than before, including soldiers from Red Ruthenia, small auxiliary forces of Lithuanian Tatars, and a few mercenaries from Silesia. It laid siege to Lessen, but Raweneck was able to defend the city. Additionally, when Casimir IV ordered a further march to Graudenz (GrudziƒÖdz), the nobility refused and instead decided to pay a new tax, which would allow the king to hire more mercenaries. After that, the situation did not change much. The Teutonic Knights were able to recover another city, Memel (Klaipƒóda), but their offensives in other directions were stopped by the burghers of Thorn and of Culmerland, and the leadership of Andrzej Tƒôczynski. In autumn 1455 the peasants of eastern Masuria, tired of the war, revolted against the Teutonic Knights but were defeated at Rhein (Ryn) on January 1, 1456. Land-based military actions were limited to raids and local skirmishes. In the maritime arena, Casimir urged Danzig to build a fleet that would be able to break sea connections between the Teutonic Order and its allies. In May 1456 privateers hired by Danzig captured Dutch ships, which caused conflict with Amsterdam and the Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good. In two weeks in August 1457, three ships from Danzig defeated a combined Danish-Livonian fleet of 16 ships near Bornholm. Earlier, in 1454, Jan Janski de Turze (pl:Jan z Jani) of the Clan of Ostoja had become the first Polish Voivode of Gda≈Ñsk and Pomerania. The Clan had been fighting the Teutonic side since the days of Stibor of Stiboricz, the Duke of Transylvania and one of the most loyal Lords of King Sigismund von Luksemburg. The strategy of the Clan of Ostoja was in the beginning of 15th century not only use of military forces but also to use diplomacy in order to make the Teutonic side weaker economically, so they could not pay the mercenaries they depended on. By the time Jan Janski de Turze become voivode of Pomerania, Szarlejski of Ostoja was Voivode of Kujawy and used the help of his Clan brother to raise funds to hire mercenaries fighting on Polish side. Stibor de Poniec of Ostoja, the Lord General of Greater Poland, joined the cause in 1457. Together with his Clan brothers Jan Janski and Szarlejski, Stibor de Poniec raised new funds to hire more mercenaries to fight on the Polish side. However, Stibor decided to use those funds to pay mercenaries that defended the main stronghold of Teutonic Knights, Malbork (Marieburg), and in return asked them to leave the stronghold. In this way, the Polish side succeeded to overtake Malbork without force, in 1457. Later, in 1466 Stibor de Poniec sealed the Second Peace of Thorn, which also finally broke the power of the Teutonic Knights. After long negotiations, Teutonic mercenaries agreed to sell three castles in Prussia, including Marienburg, to Poland. Heavy new taxes caused rebellions in Danzig and Thorn that were bloodily suppressed by the cities with help from the king's army. The Polish and Prussian estates were able to gather 190,000 Hungarian gold pieces, most of which had been borrowed from Danzig. On June 6, 1457, the castles of Marienburg, Dirschau, and Eylau were transferred to the Polish army. Two days later Casimir entered the castle of Marienburg, and its burghers paid homage to him. Ulrich Czerwonka became the first Polish sheriff of the castle, and also received three other counties. The king again granted broad privileges to the Prussian cities. It was generally expected that now, with the fall of the Teutonic Order's capital, the war would end quickly. Optimism faded, however, when the Polish army commanded by Prandota Lubieszowski was unable to take Mewe, which was again defended by Raweneck. Casimir had to return to Poland to seek money to pay his debts and mercenaries. The mood worsened when the grand master organised a new offensive. The Teutonic Knights received significant aid from the burghers of K√∂nigsberg, free Prussian knights, and others. Although they were unable to take Wehlau (Znamensk) and Schippenbeil (Sƒôpopol), the two Polish-controlled castles that were the initial target of the offensive, they again defeated the Polish army in September 1457. With the assistance of the town's burghers, Teutonic forces under the command of Bernard von Zinnenberg, who had been released from service with the Poles, took Marienburg by surprise on September 28, 1457; only the castle commanded by Czerwonka remained in Polish control. Lubieszowski was able to stop some further advances of the Teutonic army. However, they recaptured Eylau, which again pledged allegiance to the Teutonic Order, Culm, and Preu√üisch Stargard (Starogard Gda≈Ñski). The situation was saved for the Poles by a new army sent from Greater Poland. Gdansk The international situation became increasingly complicated. The new Prince-Bishop of Ermeland was Cardinal Eneas Silvio Piccolomini, known for his pro-Teutonic sympathies. In 1458, Piccolomini was elected Pope Pius II. Another complication was the death of Ladislaus the Posthumous and the election of George of Podƒõbrady as the new (Hussite) king of Bohemia, and Matthias Corvinus as king of Hungary. In spring 1458 Casimir IV again called for a lev√©e en masse, which included the Masovians. Ignoring the mediation of John Giskra (Jan Jiskra), a Czech mercenary who hoped for an end to war with Prussia and the start of a new conflict with Hungary, the Polish army slowly marched into Prussia, crossing the Vistula via a pontoon bridge near Thorn in June. Again the army was supported by Tatar auxiliary forces from Lithuania and by the king's own army. The army was commanded by Piotr of Szamotuly, the castellan of Pozna≈Ñ. The Polish army marched directly to Marienburg, reaching the city on August 10. This time it was well equipped with artillery sent by Danzig and Elbing. The siege, however, was another fiasco, due partly to lengthy negotiations, and partly to Piotr's lack of aggression on the battlefield. His inept leadership allowed Fritz Raweneck to take yet another castle. The nobles demanded the storming of the castle, and when this did not happen, they started deserting and returning to Poland. In Lower Prussia there was a peasant rebellion against Polish rule. The peasants captured a few castles and gave them to the Teutonic Knights, declaring that they were ready to fight on the Teutonic Order's side against Poland. In the meantime the king, using John Giskra as mediator, negotiated with the Teutonic Knights. The Poles again proposed that the Teutonic Order should leave Prussia for Podolia. The crusaders agreed on a mission to Podolia, but refused to leave Prussia. Danzigers proposed a compromise that would leave part of Prussia for the Teutonic Order. At one point there was a signed cease fire lasting nine months -- there was even a signed treaty, and John Giskra as the mediator was to keep Marienburg -- and peace appeared certain, but the Prussian estates decided to persuade the king to break off negotiations. One positive sign was peace with Denmark. King Christian I of Denmark finally conquered Sweden, but the Swedish king Charles VIII escaped to Poland and started supporting the Polish cause financially. Danzig and Charles VIII began hiring more privateers, which seriously damaged Baltic trade, and finally Christian I decided to sign a ceasefire in July 1458, which was extended to four years in May 1459, and then to 20 years. In 1459, Johannes von Baysen died, and his brother, Scibor, became the new governor of Prussia. The Teutonic Knights raided Polish lands and achieved a few successes, notably Komtur Kaspar Nostitz of Konitz's capture of a Polish city in northern Greater Poland for a few months. There were other attempts at mediation, such as by dukes of Bavaria and Austria, as well as by bishops from Livonia, but they were all refused by Poland. More serious mediation was undertaken by Pope Pius II, who was trying to mount a coalition against the Ottoman Turks. He suspended the ban over the Prussian Confederation and explicitly stated that the forementioned ban was also against Poland. That statement outraged Casimir, who rejected the arrival of the papal legate, Hieronymus Lando. On June 3, 1460, the pope reactivated the ban against Prussia, Poland, and the Polish king. At the same time the Bohemian king George of Podƒõbrady banned and jailed Ulrich Czerwonka and his comrades, and agreed to hire Teutonic soldiers in the territory of his kingdom. Malbork Castle during Thirteen Years' War (1460) On 21 March 1460, the Polish army, supported by Danzigers and peasants, began a siege of the town of Marienburg; the town's Malbork Castle was already in Polish control. This time the army had a more capable commander, Lubieszowski, and enough artillery. Lubieszowski died during the siege and was replaced by Jan Koscielecki with Johann Meydeburg of Danzig as his advisor. The town of Marienburg finally capitulated on 5 July. Marienburg's mayor, Burgomaster Blume, was hanged as a traitor, since he had pledged allegiance to the Polish king but later opened the gates of Marienburg to the Teutonic Knights. This Polish success was quickly countered by the Teutonic Knights, who regained other cities in western Prussia. They defeated the army of Danzig near Praust (Pruszcz Gda≈Ñski) in July 1460, and burnt the suburbs of Danzig; the Hanseatic city then asked Casimir for help. The Teutonic Order also conquered Lauenburg (Lƒôbork) and B√ºtow (Byt√≥w), which had been in the possession of Eric II of Pomerania, Leba (≈Åeba), and Putzig (Puck); the latter was garrisoned by mercenaries hired by the former Swedish king Charles VIII. Bernard von Zinnenberg also captured the castle of Schwetz (≈öwiecie). Thorn immediately sent soldiers there, who, helped by the king's army, started a siege. In the Bishopric of Warmia, the administration of Paul von Legensdorf commenced. He was appointed by the pope, and promised neutrality between the Teutonic Knights and the Polish king. The neutrality of Legendorf made him popular amongst the burghers and peasants, who were tired of war. The situation of Poland became desperate. One by one, the castles and cities in Prussia were recovered by the Teutonic army. The internal situation was pessimistic because of the conflict between the pope and the king over nominating the new bishop of Krak√≥w, since both king and pope were convinced that the other lacked the right to choose the new bishop. The Polish king again called for a lev√©e en masse, but most of the nobility refused to participate after Tƒôczynski was killed in Krak√≥w by burghers in a dispute over payment for his armor. Commanders, amongst them Piotr of Szamotuly, were disorganized, and, after raids to Eric II's Duchy of Pomerania, the army returned home after a few weeks. The failure of the latest lev√©e en masse and the Teutonic recovery of Warmia, capturing the last Polish points of resistance, convinced Casimir that the war should be left to professionals. The nobility agreed to pay new taxes for the hiring and maintaining of a more regular army. The new commander was Piotr Dunin, an innovative leader from Prawkowice. = Second phase = The Battle of Vistula Lagoon (Polish: Bitwa na Zalewie Wi≈õlanym or Polish: Bitwa w Zatoce ≈öwie≈ºej) was fought on September 15, 1463 between the navy of the Teutonic Order and the navy of the Prussian Confederation, which was allied with the King of Poland. In 1461, Poland achieved a major success with the capture of the castle of Schwetz. Polish privateers hired by Danzig were also successful, even though they were fighting not only Teutonic ships and privateers, but also ships from L√ºbeck. The first group of Polish army regulars -- initially around 2,000 soldiers -- came to Prussia around October 1461, under Dunin. Almost immediately Dunin achieved two successes, capturing the castles of Lessen and Stuhm. The Teutonic Knights at the same time captured a few cities and castles, such as the town of Strasburg (Brodnica), although the castle stayed in Polish hands, and Stargard. The Sejm in Nowe Miasto Korczyn in Lesser Poland decided to raise new taxes for increasing the Polish regular army. It was only in the summer of 1462 when Dunin finally, after losing the castle of Strasburg, could start any more serious action. His first success was the conquest of the castle of Frauenburg (Frombork). Casimir was unable to profit from the Polish successes because of troubles in Lithuania. The Lithuanians rejected the idea of moving the Teutonic Order to Podolia, even if Lithuania would acquire territories in Prussia. This forced the king to open new negotiations with the Teutonic Order, with the Hanseatic League as mediators. On July 3, 1462, negotiations started in Thorn. The Polish negotiators included Jan D≈Çugosz and the rector of the Krak√≥w Academy, Jan of DƒÖbr√≥wka. The Prussian representatives included Gabriel von Baysen and Scibor von Baysen, as well as envoys from larger cities. The Poles and Prussians argued that \\"Pomerania from time immemorial belonged to Poland, pointing out Slavic names in Pomerania, the Slavic language of inhabitants\\", the \\"tax of St. Peter\\" paid by Pomerania, and that Pomerania belonged to the Polish Diocese of W≈Çoc≈Çawek. They also strongly emphasized that Prussians of their own will asked for the incorporation of Prussia into Poland. They also tried to prove that even eastern Prussia was, in times past, tied in some way to Poland. The Teutonic Knights questioned all the arguments and past papal judgments. Instead, they strongly underlined that Poland had officially resigned all claims to Pomerania and Culmerland, and also pointed to the emperor's statement of 1453 when he forbade all opposition in Prussia. Hanseatic mediators proposed a ceasefire for 20 years, but this was refused. The Poles again proposed moving the Teutonic Order to Podolia, which was also rejected. Unofficially, the Poles unsuccessfully proposed leaving the Teutonic Order in Sambia as Polish vassals. Finally, the Poles demanded at least Pomerelia, Culmerland, Marienburg, and Elbing, and when this was rejected too, negotiations broke down. The Battle of ≈öwiecino (Schwetz), where the excellent Teutonic commander Fritz Raweneck was killed, changed the course of the war. After that battle the Poles, supported by Ulrich Czerwonka, released from Bohemian imprisonment, were able to take the offensive. On July 27, 1463, Dunin began the siege of Mewe. Because of the great strategic importance of the city and castle, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order sent reinforcements. The Teutonic army, under commanders von Plauen, von Zinnenberg, and the grand master, gathered in Stargard. On September 15, 1463, 44 ships of the Teutonic navy were destroyed by 30 ships from Danzig and Elbing in the Battle of Zatoka ≈öwie≈ºa. Soon after the battle, von Zinnenberg, with approval of the Teutonic Order, made a treaty with Poland, withdrawing from the war but retaining in his possession a few castles in Culmerland. Mewe capitulated on January 1, 1464. Teutonic state in 1466 The Teutonic Knights began to have serious financial problems. Every year they received less money from the Holy Roman Empire. Their mercenaries, the core of the Teutonic army, were not paid and refused to make any serious offensives. At the same time the armies of Poland and the Prussian Confederation (mainly Danzig) were continuing their offensive. Dunin continued on the offensive, capturing more and more castles. Masovians, enraged by Teutonic raids, organised a lev√©e en masse and captured the castle of Soldau (Dzia≈Çdowo), but again the king had to leave Poland for Lithuania, and financial problems stopped further advances. This caused another round of negotiations in 1465, which were again unsuccessful. In 1466 the Prince-Bishop of Warmia, Paul von Legensdorf, decided to join the Polish forces and declare war on the Teutonic Knights. Polish forces under Dunin were finally also able to capture Konitz on September 28, 1466. The Second Peace of Thorn of 1466 (German: Zweiter Friede von Thorn; Polish: Drugi Pok√≥j Toru≈Ñski) was a peace treaty signed in the Hanseatic city of Thorn (Toru≈Ñ) on 19 October 1466 between the Polish king Casimir IV Jagiellon and the Teutonic Knights. The Polish successes caused the exhausted Teutonic Order to seek new negotiations, which were well documented by the chronicler Jan D≈Çugosz. The new mediator was Pope Paul II. With help from the papal legate, Rudolf of R√ºdesheim, the Second Peace of Thorn was signed on October 10, 1466. Western Prussia became an autonomous Polish province, later known as Royal Prussia; the Bishopric of Warmia also came under the crown of Poland. Eastern Prussia remained under the control of the Teutonic Knights, although it became a vassal of the Polish king. The Grand Master received the title of Senator of the Polish kingdom.

It was activated in January 1940 as the United States built up its armed forces prior to World War II. In the fall of 1941, it deployed to the Caribbean and, following the attack on Pearl Harbor engaged in antisubmarine patrols. Following the transfer of the land based antisubmarine mission to the Navy, and with the lessening of threats to the Panama Canal, the squadron returned to the United States, where it was disbanded in June 1944. The squadron was reconstituted in 1947 and activated in the reserve, but it does not appear to have been fully manned or equipped before inactivating in 1949. In 1985, the squadron was consolidated with the 35th Air Defense Missile Squadron, which had provided air defense of the Northeastern United States from its base in northern New York from 1960 to 1969. The consolidated squadron was designated the 35th Tactical Missile Squadron, but has not been active since consolidation. HistoryWorld War II= The 35th Bombardment Squadron was first organized at Langley Field, Virginia in January 1940 as one of the three original squadrons of the 25th Bombardment Group. Although activated at Langley and training there, the activation orders anticipated that the squadron was to be stationed at Borinquen Field, Puerto Rico.Conaway, 35th Bombardment Squadron The squadron began to equip with Douglas B-18 Bolos in 1941.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 137Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 75-76The squadron probably flew Northrop A-17s for training while waiting for its B-18s. See Maurer, Combat Groups, p. 75 (25th Group aircraft). The squadron deployed to the Caribbean as part of the 1940 Destroyers for Bases Agreement with the British, departing Langley Field, on 26 October 1940, and was assigned to Coolidge Field, Antigua in the British West Indies (by way of Borinquen Field, Puerto Rico) before the subsequent dispersal of its original personnel and equipment. It had been assigned as a subordinate element of the 25th Bombardment Group. In May 1942, the unit was re designated as the 35th Bombardment Squadron (Medium). On 31 October 1942, the first of the confusing reassignments that have tainted the overall picture of USAAF activities in the Caribbean was instituted. At that time, the squadron inherited the personnel and equipment of the 430th Bombardment Squadron (which had formerly been the 44th Reconnaissance Squadron). Additionally, the unit also got the personnel and equipment of the 99th Bombardment Squadron which had been based at Zandery Field, Surinam. Its personnel at Zandery becoming \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" Flight of the squadron, while the former 430th BS personnel and equipment became \\"C\\" and \\"D\\" Flights. In January 1943, the Squadron Headquarters was moved from Coolidge Field back to Borinquen Field, Puerto Rico. \\"B\\" and \\"D\\" Flights of the 417th Bombardment Squadron (Medium) were reassigned to the squadron on 1 May 1943. In addition, for short periods in January, March, July and August 1943, while the German submarine warfare campaign was most critical, aircraft of the 80th Bombardment Squadron, 10th Bombardment Squadron, 8th Antisubmarine Squadron, 9th Antisubmarine Squadron and the Navy VB 130 were attached and/or operated intermingled with 35th BS aircraft. Additionally, during August 1943, aircraft and crews of the 23d Antisubmarine Squadron were attached to the 35th. These reactions to the German threat were brought about, mainly between 19 and 30 July 1943, by new and very bold tactics being displayed by the Axis U-boats, now intent on fighting it out with patrolling aircraft on the surface. All of this makes it clear that the 35th BS was a prime element in the Allied anti- submarine campaign in the Caribbean. This realization was brought home on 1 August 1943 when operational and administrative control of the Squadron and its several detachments was transferred from the 25th Bombardment Group to Antilles Air Command. By 31 December 1943 the Navy had taken over the antisubmarine mission and the far-flung detachments were inactivated. By this time, the unit was little more than an Operational Training Unit. Although the Squadron was reassigned to Waller Field, Trinidad, nominally, on 7 February 1944, as of 24 March this largely administrative transfer was ended and the Squadron was returned home to the United States. where the designation became that of a B-25 Mitchell Operational Training Unit at Alamagardo Army Air Field, New Mexico The squadron was disbanded on 20 June 1944. =Air Force reserve= Was activated as an Air Force Reserve squadron in July 1947 at Phillips Field, Maryland. May have operated some B-25s, although that is undetermined. Inactivated due to budget restraints in June 1949. =Cold War air defense= The 35th Air Defense Missile Squadron was activated on 1 June 1960 at Niagara Falls Air Force Missile Site, New York and assigned to Syracuse Air Defense Sector of Air Defense Command. The squadron was equipped with IM-99 BOMARC surface to air missiles and became fully operational in December 1961. The squadron's missiles were tied into the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) network. The squadron maintained alert status with its missiles until it was inactivated at the end of December 1969.Cornett & Johnson, p. 150 The two squadrons were consolidated in September 1985 as the 35th Tactical Missile Squadron.

The English language translation of The House of the Mosque was published in January 2010. Plot The book follows the life of an Iranian family from 1969 on through the regime of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Iranian revolution of 1979 and the installment of the Khomeini government, and ends after Khomeini's death. The story is a \\"semi-mythical narrative ... bearing a 'flying carpet' element of fantasy\\" that is countered by the horrifying events that the protagonists face as the revolution progresses.Arifa Akbar, The House of the Mosque, By Kader Abdolah trans Susan Massotty, book review in The Independent, 7 January 2010. Most of the plot takes place in a large (36-room) house attached to the Friday Mosque in Senejan, three hours by train from Qom, a fictionalized version of Senjan, now a district of Arak, Iran. Kader Abdolah was born and grew up in a similar house in that city.BBC World Service program, 'The Strand,' 23 January 2010, describes the book and interviews the author .James Buchan, The House of the Mosque by Kader Abdolah, book review in The Guardian, 2 April 2010. In the presentation of real historical events, many names and locations are altered, so that the novel does not pretend to be an accurate description of the historical situation. The main character is Aqa Jaan (\\"Dear Master\\", a title often given to the male head of a household in Iran). Shahbal, the son of his blind cousin who is the muezzin of the mosque, personifies the author (Shahbal is called the \\"narrator\\" of the story in the cast of characters). Like Shahbal, Kader Abdolah was active in leftish underground political movements in the time of the Shah and of Khomeini, and fled Iran in 1985 to settle in the Netherlands. Unlike Shahbal, the author did not kill anyone, but instead avenged the murders of his brother and sister with his pen. For example, before fleeing Iran, Shahbal killed Khalkhal, a fictionalized version of Khomeini's \\"hanging judge\\" Sadeq Khalkhali, but the real Khakhali died of old age in 2003. Main themes The House of the Mosque primarily explores the lifestyle of a traditional, extended Iranian family and how they coped with the changes brought by the Westernization of Iran until 1979, the revolution and the subsequent radicalization. Additionally, the book portrays struggles between the leaders of the bazaar and the religious rule of the imams‚Äîand between family members who are traditionalists and those who are caught up in revolutionary ideas and do not follow the old rules of the house.

Early years He was born in 1583, the son of Sir Lachlan Mor Maclean the 14th Clan Chief. His father, Sir Lachlan, was killed in the Battle of Traigh Ghruinneart. Hector, then twenty years old, was then made Chief of Clan Maclean. His first act was to retaliate against Clan MacDonald for the death of his father. Battle of Benbigrie He obtained a commission of fire and sword against the MacDonalds of Islay, and summoned the Chief of the Clan Mackinnon, MacLeod of Dunvegan, and MacNeil of Barra to his assistance in 1598 at the Battle of Benbigrie. The Chief of the Camerons of Lochiel joined this force with his clan. The united clans, fully equipped, proceeded to Islay. Sir James MacDonald, 9th of Dunnyveg, in anticipation of this movement on the part of the young Lord of Duard, mustered together the whole gathering of Islay and Kintyre, and prepared himself for a conflict which he had reason to believe would be of a sanguinary nature. The hostile parties met at a place called Benbigrie, and as neither felt disposed to offer nor to accept terms, the result was an immediate battle. The followers of the Chief of Clan MacLean, upon this occasion, considerably outnumbered the MacDonalds; but Sir James MacDonald, 9th of Dunnyveg, well aware that he need hope for no reconciliation with his enraged kinsman, told his followers that in a resolute resistance alone existed any hope of safety to themselves or of protection to their homes. The MacDonalds, goaded to desperation by a knowledge of these facts, fought with uncontrollable fury, and it was not until the heights of Benbigrie were covered with their slain, and their chief carried off the field dangerously wounded, that their assailants succeeded in routing them. Overwhelmed by numbers the unfortunate MacDonalds were at length obliged to give way and fly in the utmost confusion, not knowing whither, neither mountain nor valley afforded them shelter from their victorious pursuers. A few, however, carrying with them their wounded chief, made their way to Kintyre, leaving Islay a prey to the ruthless invaders. For three days the allied clans pursued the work of destruction with remorseless barbarity throughout the island. Every human habitation was burned to the ground; and the poor inhabitants were left to seek their only shelter in caves and clefts of rocks among the mountains, without fuel and without food. The career of the merciless victors only ceased when the work of destruction was complete. The Chief of the Camerons of Lochiel had the satisfaction of taking Hector MacLean of Lochbuie, 9th Chief, who aided the MacDonalds against his own chief, with several of his followers, prisoners of war, and detained them in chains for six months. Hector MacLean of Lochbuy, however, soon after had ample opportunity of being even with the Chief of the Camerons of Lochiel. Of all the conflicts between these two clans, this, the last, was the most sanguinary and destructive. The MacLeans and their confederates no doubt felt themselves justified in executing signal vengeance upon their enemies, for the treachery displayed during the Battle of Traigh Ghruinneart, and the loss there of so distinguished a chief. They were also forced to make the destruction as complete as possible, for the conduct of Sir James MacDonald, 9th of Dunnyveg had made him popular with his clan, and his actions had met their approval. However deplorable may have been the loss of life, and the sufferings endured by the innocent and helpless, the result was to put a final and effectual end to the struggle between the contending clans. Ever after the Battle of Benbigrie the MacLeans and MacDonalds laid aside their animosities, and lived on the happiest terms of friendship and reciprocal good will. In the year 1599, James VI of Scotland, finding the Royal Exchequer still in a depleted condition, again turned his eyes toward the Western Isles, and decided that the chiefs should be mulcted in a sufficient amount to meet his demands, so he appointed a new commission of lieutenandry over the whole Isles and Highlands of Inverness-shire, which was granted to the Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox and George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly, the latter having been recently restored to favor. Although the official document, which sets forth the reasons for the action of the king, gives a shocking picture of the Islesmen, yet this clause establishes the true import of the commission: \\"And besides all their other crimes, they rebelliously withhold from his Majesty a great part of the patrimony and proper rent of the crown, deprive the country of the benefit which might redound thereto, by the trade of fishing, and of other commodities which these bounds render.\\" And now, at last, a great part of them have banded, conspired, and daily practice, by force and policy, in their barbarous and rebellious form, to disappoint his Majesty's service in the Lewis. As to the extent which this lieutenandry was acted upon is now uncertain. It is positive, however, that as a matter of justice, but little was due the crown from rents, and the amount demanded was beyond the ability of the chiefs to meet. In 1601, another commission of lieutenandry was granted to the same parties; the South of Argyleshire Isles included under the immediate charge of Lennox. These lieutenants were charged to assist certain colonists who would be better able greatly to augment the king's rents. Power was given them to use force and pursue the Islesmen with fire and sword. Rewards were offered these commissioners for the faithful performance of the duty assigned to them. Forfeiture of his estates Acting upon his authority, the George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly, who had charge of the northern districts, summoned a convention of estates, to meet at Stirling, Scotland within a given period, under a penalty of forfeiture against an absentee, but many of the northern chiefs, from the distance they had to travel, and the limited period allowed for their appearance, were unable to be in attendance on the day appointed. As Hector Og Maclean owned the lands of Garbhghambluch, in Lochaber, he started at once for Stirling. On arriving there, he met George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly on the street early on the morning that his name was to be called. After George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly had saluted him, MacLean asked him if he thought he would have time to change his clothes before the roll would be called. Huntly answered he had plenty of time. On repairing to his lodging, Hector learned the convention was in session, and immediately hurried to the assembly, and on arriving there found his name had been called. On parting with Hector in the street, Huntly went direct to the convention, and determined at once to put in execution the threat he had uttered against Sir Lachlan Mor Maclean, on account of the latter's proposal to bring George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly dead or alive, the night after the Battle of Glenlivat; so he ordered MacLean's name called at once, and as the latter was not present, Huntly immediately applied for the forfeit, procured it, and is still in the possession of it. All the friends and interest that Hector could make, or bring to bear on the king, were never able to reverse the sentence, as Huntly always made great opposition. Thus he felt himself amply revenged on the son of Sir Lachlan Mor Maclean. Hector Og Maclean died in 1623. Marriage and children Maclean's first marriage was to Janet Mackenzie of Kintail, the second daughter of Colin Cam Mackenzie of Kintail They had two sons: *Hector Mor Maclean, 16th Clan Chief (circa 1600-1626), his eldest son, who succeeded his father as clan chief. *Sir Lachlan Maclean, 1st Baronet (circa 1600-1649), succeeded his elder brother as the 17th Clan Chief after his brother's death in 1626 until his own death in 1649. Maclean's second marriage was to Isabella Acheson of Gosford. She was the daughter of Sir Archibald Acheson, 1st Baronet.Sources list her as the daughter of Sir Archibald Acheson, 1st Baronet, but because of her age, she may have been the daughter of Captain Patrick Acheson. If she was roughly the same age as Hector Og Maclean, she would have been born in 1585. If she was the daughter of Sir Archibald Acheson she would be born no earlier than 1610 and would have been at least 20 years younger than Hector Og Maclean. This would make her the same age as her own children. They also had two sons: *Donald MacLean, 1st Laird of Brolas (circa 1600‚Äìafter 1655) His great-grandson, Sir Allan Maclean, 6th Baronet became the 22nd Clan Chief when the 21st Chief died without an heir. * Sir John Maclean, 1st Baronet (1604-1666).

It was first activated in Panama in 1941 during the expansion of the United States Army Air Corps before World War II. Following the Attack on Pearl Harbor the squadron participated in antisubmarine patrols in the Caribbean Sea and adjoining waters. When the United States Navy assumed this mission in 1943, the squadron moved to the United States and was disbanded. The squadron was reactivated in the reserve in 1947 and assigned to the 319th Bombardment Group. After 1949, it trained with Douglas B-26 Invader light bombers at Birmingham Municipal Airport. It was mobilized for the Korean War in March 1951 and its personnel used as fillers for other organizations before inactivating on 22 March 1951. HistoryWorld War II= The squadron was activated as the 59th Bombardment Squadron (Light) on 1 January 1941, and assigned to the Panama Canal Department. It drew its cadre from elements of the 9th Bombardment Group and was equipped with Douglas A-20A Havocs. The next day, the squadron was further assigned to the 19th Bombardment Wing and, on 6 January, attached to the 9th Bombardment Group, which had recently moved to Panama. The unit spent its first 10 months of existence at Rio Hato Army Air Base, where they were housed in tents, while they built more permanent wooded barracks.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 48‚Äì50 This unit was attached to the 9th Group specifically to support the Panama Mobile Force. It was assigned to the VI Bomber Command on 18 September 1941. The Squadron received new Douglas A-20A Havocs by May 1942. The unit moved from Rio Hato to the new Howard Field on 28 October 1941 and, shortly after the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, was dispersed to Aguadulce Army Air Field. The 59th's mission included close-in anti-submarine \\"offensive\\" patrols, rapid reconnaissance of and offense against potential amphibious landings or advances of enemy ground forces which might eventuate, direct support of friendly ground forces and, in exactly these words, \\"use as attack aviation in combination with other Air Forces, Parachute Troops and Airborne Infantry in support of friendly Latin American governments\\" as needed. A month after the Pearl Harbor Attack, B and C Flights were detached from the squadron and attached to the VI Interceptor Command at Hato Field, Cura√ßao and Dakota Field, Aruba. They remained attached until finally assigned to what was now VI Fighter Command on 23 June. The main squadron remained at Aguadulce Field, Panama until it joined the Flights in the Antilles on 10 March. The arrival of the detachments in Aruba and Cura√ßao was timely as on 16 February 1942, one of the A-20A made the first Command attack on a German U-Boat when a sub was attacked eight miles off Willemstad. Over the next five days, not fewer than time attacks were made on submarines, following by 10 more through January 1943. On 19 March 1943, the squadron was assigned directly subordinate to the Antilles Air Task Force. However, the squadron was attached to the 25th Bombardment Group and remained under its operational control as late as 26 April 1943. This attachment lasted until 19 July, when the unit was attached to the Trinidad Detachment, VI Fighter Command, Antilles Air Command. Meanwhile, the unit itself had been redesignated, on 10 June 1943, as the 59th Bombardment Squadron (Medium). By 12 July 1943, by now located at Edinburgh Field, Trinidad and two North American B-25D Mitchells and two B-25Gs had been received. By the end of 1943 the A-20s had been replaced by B-25G's and the Squadron was moved to Beane Field on St Lucia. When the Navy took over responsibility for antisubmarine warfare during the summer of 1943, the 59th, and other bombardment units in the Caribbean became a reserve strike force and its mission was training and participation in exercises until March 1944, when it moved to the United States. Shortly after its arrival at Alamogordo Army Air Field, New Mexico, the squadron was disbanded on 20 June 1944. Many of its personnel were used to support training for the Boeing B-29 Superfortress program, which was organizing units at the time. =Air Force reserve= A-26 Invader in flight The squadron was reconstituted and activated in the reserve under Air Defense Command (ADC) at Mitchel Field, New York in July 1947 amd assigned to the 319th Bombardment Group. At Mitchel, the squadron trained under the supervision of the 113th AAF Base Unit (later the 2230 Air Force Reserve Training Center), although it is not clear whether it was fully manned or equipped during this period. In July 1948 Continental Air Command (ConAC) assumed responsibility for managing reserve and Air National Guard units from ADC.

Reviews  * On 19 April 1971, The Daily Telegraph London wrote about Ortrun Wenkels concert in the English Bach Festival: \\"Each of the soloists sang with some command here but outstanding was the splendid young contralto Ortrun Wenkel, who produced the liveliest and most committed solo of the evening.\\"The Daily Telegraph, London, 29 April 1971 * In September 1981, Speight Jenkins wrote in Record World, New York, about the recording of Das Rheingold with Ortrun Wenkel (Erda), Siegmund Nimsgern (Alberich), Theo Adam (Wotan), Peter Schreier (Loge), Lucia Popp (Woglinde), Yvonne Minton (Fricka) and the Staatskapelle Dresden under the direction of Marek Janowski, recorded 1980 in Dresden: \\"Of the singers the best by far is Ortrun Wenkel, the Erda.

Description The homestead comprises a dwelling house, a grist mill, and a Bollman-design bridge. History The Shriver Homestead was built in 1797 by Andrew and David Shriver and has been continually occupied by the family. The mill, also built 1797, is a large brick structure, built of locally manufactured brick laid in both Flemish bond and common bond. On June 30, 1863, General J.E.B. Stuart of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia camped at Union Mills and was hosted by part of the Shriver family. On the following day, General James Barnes of the 5th Corps of the Army of the Potomac arrived on the site and welcomed and entertained by other members of the family. Union Mills was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. The Union Mills Homestead was home to the Shriver family for 6 generations. It is currently a historic landmark located near Westminster, Maryland, about 17 miles south of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The Homestead is now a museum of American culture, operated by the Union Mills Homestead Foundation, a non-profit foundation with all proceeds dedicated to the preservation and restoration of the Union Mills Homestead Complex. = The building of the Shriver homestead = The following passage is excerpted from \\"Union Mills: The Shriver Homestead Since 1797\\" by Frederic Shriver Klein: > The Shriver brothers bought a large tract of land along Big Pipe Creek, > about seven miles north of Westminster and along early roads leading into > Littlestown and Pennsylvania's roads toward the west. The junction of Pipe > Creek and Deep Run furnished a strong flow of water for a mill in the wide > valley, and gentle slopes on either side provided land for grazing, farming > or settlement. Heavy stands of black oak would furnish tanbark for a > tannery, and the Shrivers knew a good bit about tanning leather. At this > time, Andrew Shriver was operating a store and tavern in Littlestown, > Pennsylvania, and David was practicing as a civil engineer in Maryland. > The original mill contract shows that on January 25, 1797, the two brothers > completed arrangements with John Mong, a Frederick County millwright to > construct \\"a set of mills,\\" a grist mill and a saw mill. On March 13, Jacob > Keefer and John Eckert contracted \\"to mould and burn a kiln of brick\\" for > the mill, \\"providing 100,000 brick or more, to be paid for at the rate of > one French crown for every thousand brick.\\" The brick kiln was constructed > near the creek, known in previous years as Pipeclay Creek. > The house had its origin on January 26 of the same year, when a contract > was made with Henry Kohlstock of York County, Pennsylvania, for building a > small double house as a residence for the two brothers.

In 858, Norsemen raided and burned down Chartres. After that, the town's defenses were rebuilt and strengthened. It turned into a fortified, trapezoid-like city, going close to the river. In 911, Rollo led the Danes in another siege of the city. Richard of Burgundy split his forces into three corps, the first being made up of Aquitanians, to defend it.Lair, Jules. Le siege de Chartres par les Normands, 1901 According to legend, Bishop Gantelme exposed the Virgin's tunic on the ramparts and led a mob of peasants to charge, and the Norsemen fled as a result. The West Frankish cavalry led by King Charles the Simple, which had arrived, now pursued the Norsemen. Short on time to be able to board his army onto his ships due to the rapid approach of the horsemen, Rollo and his men decided to make a defensive wall by slaughtering the livestock from his ships. The Frankish charge was halted as their horses were intimidated by the sight and smell of the livestock corpses. The Franks, unable to attack, decided to instead open negotiations with Rollo. The Danes had been formidable enough to persuade Charles the Simple that they might become valuable allies. And thus the battle ended, as both sides began formulating the Treaty of Saint-Clair- sur-Epte.

He is currently a professor at the Palm Beach Atlantic University and holds the endowed Pledger Family Chair of Philosophy and Ethics. He has written and edited over 25 books in the area of philosophy of religion, apologetics, theology, science & religion, and the historicity of Jesus Christ. He has contributed many articles to professional journals and has written many essays for edited books. For six years he served as the president of the Evangelical Philosophical Society.  Early life and education  Paul Copan's father, Valery Copan, is of Ukrainian origin, and his mother, Valtraut (Kirsch) Copan, was born in Riga, Latvia. He was born in Cleveland, Ohio and then moved to Connecticut as a teenager. From 1980-1984, he attended Columbia International University and earned a B.A. degree in biblical studies. Copan attended Trinity International University, where he received his M.A. in philosophy of religion, as well as his M.Div. at Trinity International. Copan received the Prof. C.B. Bjuge Award for a thesis that ‚Äúevidences creative scholarship in the field of Biblical and Systematic Theology.‚Äù In May 2000, Copan received his Ph.D. in philosophy of religion from Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His dissertation topic was \\"The Moral Dimensions of Michael Martin‚Äôs Atheology: A Critical Assessment.\\" Career Copan at Tyndale University College. His talk, \\"Slavery and Genocide? A Fresh Look at Two Old Testament Ethical Issues\\" addressed charges that the Old Testament condones slavery and genocide. Copan started his career on the pastoral staff of First Presbyterian Church in Schenectady, NY. He served with Ravi Zacharias International Ministries and was Adjunct Associate Professor at Trinity International University (Deerfield, Illinois). He was Adjunct Associate Professor of Theology and Philosophy at Bethel Seminary. He was Adjunct Associate Professor of Philosophy at Georgia Perimter College. Currently, Copan is the Pledger Family Chair of Philosophy and Ethics/Professor, Philosophy and Ethics at Palm Beach Atlantic University in West Palm Beach, FL, where he received the Mentor of the Year award. ViewsAtheism= He has criticized the presumption of atheism, (i.e. the notion that atheism should be one's default position when evaluating arguments over the existence of God). He argues that such a position rigs the rules, since atheism is just as much a claim to knowledge as theism. The only natural default position is agnosticism. Copan cites atheists such as Baggini and Flew in arguing that atheism is not a mere lack of belief but a rejection of belief in God or gods. He argues that atheists often slide into defending agnosticism when asked for reasons for their view. He suggests that scientific naturalists will argue that all claims of knowledge have to be scientifically verifiable; otherwise, they are meaningless. Copan argues that such a position commits the fallacy exemplified in Horton Hears a Who: \\"If you cannot see, hear, or feel something, it does not exist.\\" Copan argues that this position is an arbitrary philosophical (rather than scientific) pronouncement. He also argues that the position of the scientific naturalist is self-refuting because scientism itself cannot be scientifically verified. Copan also believes that belief in God is generally not a psychological crutch, claiming that the argument that Christianity is wish fulfillment itself falls victim to a number of fallacies. Freud himself admitted to Oskar Pfister that psychoanalysis of religion has no clinical evidence, and are merely Freud's personal views. Copan also argues that it is odd and arbitrary to claim that whatever brings comfort and solace is false. He notes that comforting father figure, while unique to the biblical faith, is not at the heart of the other world religions. Copan also notes that the wish fulfillment argument against Christianity is a classic example of the genetic fallacy, claiming that because one can explain how the belief arose, that the belief is therefore false. =Presuppositionalism= Copan is also a critic of presuppositionalism, arguing that Christians can use common ground to engage non-Christians in debate. He argues that presuppositionalism begs the question. It assumes that God exists in order to argue that God exists. Instead, Christians can begin dialogues with non-Christians with common ground such as the law of non-contradiction. Copan uses Genesis 9:6 to make his point. He claims that the image of God was not completely destroyed in the fall, meaning that non-Christians can respond to general revelation, arguments from cosmology and history, as well as personal testimony and living a godly life. Ultimately, Copan argues, presuppositionalism confuses private knowledge of God with public proclamation and argument for God. One can have epistemic certainty of God's existence from private experience and still appeal to public evidence to persuade others of that fact. =Old Testament Ethics= Copan is known for his defense of the ethics of the Old Testament, particularly divine command morality. Warfare He argues that the books of Joshua and Judges are literarily connected, and therefore need to be read in light of one another. The book of Judges demonstrates that military engagement. The sweeping words like ‚Äúall,‚Äù ‚Äúyoung and old,‚Äù and ‚Äúman and woman,‚Äù however, are stock expressions for totality ‚Äî even if women and children were not present. This stereotypical ancient Near East language of ‚Äúall‚Äù people describes attacks on what turn out to be military forts or garrisons containing combatants ‚Äî not a general population that includes women and children. Copan states that we have no archaeological evidence of civilian populations at Jericho or Ai. At first glance, it appears that Joshua captured all the land, defeated all the kings, and destroyed all the Canaanites. Joshua later refers to nations that ‚Äúremain among you,‚Äù and he warns Israel not to mention, swear by, serve, or bow down to their gods, indicating that he did fulfill the command, and yet did not literally obliterate the Canaanite population. Copan states that Joshua uses ancient conventional warfare rhetoric. He notes many other ancient Near East military accounts are full of bravado and exaggeration, depicting total devastation. Ancient Near East readers knew this was massive hyperbole and not literally true. Slavery Copan argues that the Biblical concept of slavery is misunderstood. He says that we should compare Hebrew debt-servanthood (many translations render this ‚Äúslavery‚Äù) more fairly to apprentice-like positions to pay off debts. This resembles indentured servitude during America‚Äôs founding when people worked for approximately 7 years to pay off the debt for their passage to the New World. Copan states that God did not allow physical abuse of servants. If a servant was harmed, for example, by having a tooth or eye knocked out, the servant received freedom immediately. Masters who killed their servants were put to death. He also argues that the New Testament is not silent on the issue of slavery. During the first century, 85 to 90 percent of Rome‚Äôs population consisted of slaves in both lowly and prestigious positions. This was a much higher percent than Israel had in the Old Testament, but this was due to Rome‚Äôs policies and laws. Copan uses James 3:9 to argue that the New Testament presupposes a fundamental equality because all humans are created in God‚Äôs image. Christian masters called Christian slaves ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù or ‚Äúsisters.‚Äù The New Testament commanded masters to show compassion, justice, and patience. Their position as master meant responsibility and service, not oppression and privilege. Given the spiritual equality of slave and free, slaves even took on leadership positions in churches. He states that early Christians undermined slavery indirectly, rejecting many common Greco-Roman assumptions about it and acknowledging the intrinsic, equal worth of slaves. Copan argues that if the New Testament authors had been too explicit about overthrowing Rome's slavery system, it would have done the gospel a disservice. Rome would have quashed any such flagrant opposition with speedy, lethal force. Copan concludes that the New Testament took a more subversive strategy, by opposing oppression, slave trade, and treating humans as cargo ‚Äî which eventually led to a slavery-free Europe a few centuries later. Imprecatory Psalms Copan defends the Old Testament imprecatory psalms, which are psalms that call down curses and divine judgments against Israel's enemies. He argues that they fit into the literary genre of the time. He states \\"Consider how you would react if a neighbor tried to seduce your daughter or give your children drugs. Outrage indicates that we care and take injustice seriously.\\" Copan also compares these psalms to the emotional rants of Jeremiah, wishing he had remained in his mother‚Äôs womb until he died. Jeremiah's desire was one of emotional outburst, and he did not sincerely believe what he said. Copan argues that the imprecatory Psalms should be read in the same way.  Personal life Copan is married to Jacqueline Mariette (van Tol) Copan, the daughter of Dutch parents, and they have six children.

Such provision can be derived not just from monetary assets but from any others forming part of the estate or which have been disposed of in the six years prior to the death. The Act was introduced to extend the Inheritance (Family Provision) Act 1938, following reports from the Law Commission in 1973 and 1974. Types of claimants There are categories under which someone can make an Inheritance Act 1975 claim by virtue of their relationship at death with a person who was domiciled in England and Wales. These categories are: * Spouse or civil partner * Former spouse or civil partner who has not remarried or repartnered * Person living as cohabitant * Child * Someone treated as a child or being financially maintained In each of these categories there are criteria and requirements that must be satisfied for eligibility to claim. Repeals This Act entirely repealed the Inheritance (Family Provision) Act 1938.

Its last assignment was with the 25th Bombardment Group at Alamogordo Army Air Field, New Mexico where it was inactivated on 20 June 1944. History The squadron was established in September 1939 the 27th Reconnaissance Squadron (Long Range), a B-17 Flying Fortress reconnaissance squadron at Langley Field, Virginia. The 27th deployed to Borinquen Field, Puerto Rico in November. On Puerto Rico, it was assigned to the 13th Composite Wing, and was redesignated as the 27th Reconnaissance Squadron (Heavy) on 20 November 1940. The unit performed a number of long-range missions down the Antilles Islands chain, including frequent trips to St. Croix. After the Pearl Harbor Attack, elements were attached to the 25th and 40th Bombardment Groups. On 16 February, the Squadron had been assigned to the Antilles Air Task Force. \\"A\\" Flight of the Squadron was deployed to Camaguey Airfield, Cuba in April 1942, and a detachment was at Vernam Field, Jamaica. On 7 May 1942, the squadron was redesignated as the 417th Bombardment Squadron (Medium) while attached to the 25th Bombardment Group and the squadron was heavily involved in antisubmarine sweeps in the waters around Cuba, the Windward Passage, and the Cayman Trench. The squadron moved west on 24 September 1942 to Vernam Field, Jamaica, then moved to Losey Field, Puerto Rico, on 29 May 1943, where the long-standing attachment to the 25th Bombardment Group became an assignment. Detachments at different times operated from Borinquen Field, Puerto Rico; San Juan Naval Air Station, Puerto Rico; Guantanamo Bay NAS, Cuba; Camaguey Field, Cuba. In August 1943, the Squadron received the North American B-25D Mitchell. The Squadron moved on 12 September, this time returning to Borinquen Field. The detachment at Camaguey Field, Cuba, was discontinued in August 1943. However, these crews were apparently moved to San Juli√°n Field, Cuba, By 31 December 1943 with the Navy taking over the antisubmarine mission, the squadron had become, essentially, an operational training unit. In April 1944 the squadron returned to the United States and was disbanded on 20 June. Many of the older veterans of the squadron had in fact departed for the U.S. and other war theaters as early as December 1943.

The bombs failed to explode, but the main suspect, Khalid Duhham Al-Jawary, was not caught until January 1991. The attempted attack was the first such Black September operation within the United States. Background Black September was formed in 1970, after the Black September conflict between Palestinians and Jordanians erupted in Jordan that same year. In September 1972 it caught world attention with the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. Israel soon responded with the Wrath of God campaign. In early March 1973, the group attacked the Saudi embassy in Khartoum, killing the U.S. Ambassador and Deputy Chief of Mission as well as the Belgian Charg√© d'affaires. PlotPlanning= On January 12, 1973, Khalid Duhham Al-Jawary, described in a federal warrant as a 27-year-old Iraqi linked to Black September but self-described as a Palestinian who grew up in Jordan, flew through Montreal to Boston, and then on to New York City. On January 17 the FBI, acting on a tip received in Tel Aviv, interviewed Al- Jawary about his activities. Al-Jawary claimed to be in flight training at Teterboro Airport, and would leave a month to become a commercial pilot in the Mideast. During his time in New York, Al-Jawary became friendly with a woman named Carol, and used trips to Manhattan with her son Todd in order to reconnoiter targets without arousing suspicion. =Car bombs= Just days after the Khartoum killings, around March 4, 1973, Al-Jawary took three rented cars rigged with explosives and placed them around various Israeli targets in the city; one at Fifth Avenue and 47th Street at the First Israel Bank and Trust company, another at Fifth Avenue and 43rd Street at an Israel Discount Bank, and a third at El-Al's cargo terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The bombs consisted of gasoline, propane tanks, and Semtex, as well as batteries and blasting caps. The two cars on Fifth Avenue had alarm clocks for timing the detonators, whereas the one at JFK, two times as powerful, utilized an advanced electronic timer known as an \\"e-cell\\". In addition to the explosives, someone had placed Black September propaganda in the cars, concealed in Hebrew language newspapers. According to a Federal agent at the time, the explosives were supposed to detonate at noon on March 4 with the arrival of Prime Minister Meir in the city. However, the bombs never detonated, a failure which the FBI ascribed at the time to \\"an error in the circuitry system.\\" Discovery According to an Associated Press investigation released in 2009, the National Security Agency had intercepted an encrypted message sent from official Iraqi diplomatic communications in the United States to the Iraqi foreign ministry in Baghdad (and then the Palestine Liberation Organization), which revealed the plot and the bombs' locations. At 7:15 pm on March 6, officials from the FBI and New York Police Department started a search for the car bombs. All three cars were found: the two on Fifth Avenue had been towed and impounded at Pier 56 on March 5, and subsequently discovered on March 7 by their rental agency, while the car at the airport was found early in the morning on March 7 and disabled by NYPD bomb squad member Terence McTigue. According to the FBI, the detonation of one of the bombs by police caused a fireball 50 to 75 feet high and 25 feet wide, creating a potential fatality zone of 100 yards that could have killed hundreds. They soon issued a warrant for the arrest of the main suspect, Al- Jawary, but also stated publicly at the time, \\"It would have been a pretty tough job for one man.\\" Aftermath In the immediate aftermath of the failed attack the FBI launched a massive investigation for the case, codenamed Tribomb. Three hundred FBI agents took part, recovering 60 fingerprints identified as those of Al-Jawary and conducting hundreds of interviews. Despite immediately issuing a warrant for the arrest of Al-Jawary, he managed to escape the country, but in 1991, while flying from Iraq to Tunis for the funeral of Abu Iyad, he was detained in Rome for use of a false Jordanian passport. A few months later Italian authorities handed over custody to the FBI, who flew Al-Jawary to stand trial in Brooklyn. In April 1993, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Al-Jawary was released on February 19, 2009 from the U.S. Federal prison system and handed over to U.S. immigration officials.

Born in 1939, he was described as the \\"saviour of the British motorcycle industry\\". Invited to Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament, in 1987 he was visited by the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. He died in February 2009, aged 69. L F Harris International Ltd Harris began his own business in 1974 manufacturing and selling spare parts for classic motorcycles. As the leading British manufacturers such as Norton Motorcycles, BSA and Triumph went out of business, Harris bought as many spare parts as he could and set up L F Harris International Ltd at a warehouse in Newton Abbot.Leslie Frederick Harris worked as Director (MOTORCYCLE MANUFACTURER) at L F HARRIS (INTERNATIONAL) LIMITED from 8 November 1991 to 17 February 2009 - http://www.cbetta.com/director/leslie-frederick-harris The venture was a success and he expanded by purchasing an engineering company in Leighton Buzzard and a retail shop in Paignton, Devon. Triumph motorcycle production Triumph T140 Bonneville built under licence by LF Harris Rare Triumph TR7V Tiger built under licence by LF Harris fitted here with aftermarket silencers, direction indicators and rear suspension units. This model was also used by the Royal Signals Motorcycle Display Team. When Triumph's Meriden motorcycle factory closed in, 1983 Harris bid for the rights to the Triumph name and the opportunity to build the Triumph Bonneville T140 with the former Meriden Triumph engineer Brian Jones as well as a number of former personnel from Meriden.Born Again Bonneville Motorcycle Enthusiast (August 1985) Instead, under a renewable five year licence starting from 28 November 1983 granted by the successful bidder, John Bloor, the new owner of Triumph, Harris manufactured 750 cc Bonnevilles (and some of the 750 cc single-carburettor TR7V Tiger models Besuch der alten Dame PS (7/1987) also used by the Royal Signals Motorcycle Display Team) until 1988. The announcement of Harris restarting Bonneville production was made on 25 June 1985 at Forde House with local member of parliament Patrick Nicolls and motorcycling personalities such as Bert Hopwood in attendance. Harris eventually moved to a bigger factory and warehouse and because of these 'Devon' Bonnevilles, Triumph can claim to have been in continuous production of motorcycles since 1902, making Triumph the oldest continuous production motorcycle manufacturer in the world - This is incorrect, as Royal Enfield have been manufacturing uninterrupted since 1901, albeit in different countries. There was no mutual agreement between Harris and Bloor to renew the manufacturing licence.Wilson, Steve British Motorcycles Since 1950 (Vol 5) Triumph: The Company Patrick Stephens Limited (1991) There was a lot of media interest in the venture and Harris was described as the \\"saviour of the British motorcycle industry\\". In fact, the Triumphs manufactured by Harris were distinct from Meriden-made models in having significantly more German and Italian component parts (such as Italian Brembo brakes, Paioli front suspension and Lafranconi silencers, German Magura switchgear, Varta battery and Merit horn) as the British motorcycle component industry had shrunk massively by the 1980s.Bonnie: The Development History Of The Triumph Bonneville (2nd edition) by JR Nelson (Haynes 2001) The Matchless G80 In 1988 Harris decided not to re-licence the rights to the Triumph and began to design his own version of a motorcycle, the Matchless G80. Fitted with a Rotax 494 cc air-cooled engine, there was also a Harris Matchless G80 built with a twin front disc brake and an electric starter. These were produced until the recession of 1990 when the business returned to producing much sought after spare parts for classic motorcycles. Harris also built eight Matchless G80s for trial with the White Helmets Display Team.

Modern historians cannot make up their minds as to the true location of Mindaugas's coronation. As early as the 14th century, Navahrudak is known to have possessed a stone tower along the lines of Tower of Kamyanyets. Other fortifications were of timber. The castle was stormed by the Teutonic Knights under Heinrich von Pl√∂tzke in 1314. Although the attack was not successful, the tower sustained substantial damage. During the reign of Vytautas the Great four new stone towers were added to the system of Navahrudak fortifications. In the 17th century the main castle boasted 7 towers, apart from those of the Lesser Castle. Navahrudak was one of the northernmost forts besieged by the Crimean Tatars in the 16th century. Navahrudak was twice occupied by Russian forces during the Russo-Polish War (1654‚Äì67). Further destruction was inflicted by the Swedes who sacked Navahrudak as part of the Great Northern War in 1706. Attempts to preserve the ruins from further decay were undertaken in the 1920s. The castle grounds at present provide the setting for medieval reenactment and theatrical jousting.

During the War of Independence in 1918‚Äì1920, 4,000 people were killed, and 14,000 wounded on the Estonian side. In 1936, a law was passed to establish a nationwide monument in commemoration of the war. Preparatory work was interrupted by the Second World War and subsequent Soviet occupation. After Estonia regained independence in 1991, the question of establishing a national monument for the commemoration of the War of Independence was raised again. In the spring of 2005, the Riigikogu decided that a column of victory in memory of the War would be erected at the Freedom Square in Tallinn.

The gold thread is attached in sections, then couched with a different, less expensive, thread at turns. This ensures that none of the gold thread is used in a non-visible area. Traditionally, tapis has floral motifs. However, modern tapis may also be based on the weaver's own design and include non-floral motifs, such as Arabic calligraphy. Other designs may include snakes, ships, and mythical creatures. Some tapis, called tapis tua (old tapis), are covered entirely in golden embroidery. Although generally produced by Lampungese home industries, tapis is also produced in other areas, including Kendal, Central Java and Pisang Island.

It was directed by Don Hartman who co-wrote the screenplay with Edwin H. Knopf, based on a play by Edwin H. Knopf. The music score is by Bronis≈Çaw Kaper. Lana Turner's singing voice was dubbed by Trudy Erwin. In 1979, the film entered the public domain in the United States because Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer neglected to renew the copyright registration in the 28th year after publication. Plot In Italy in 1939, a European man calling himself Mr. Imperium (Ezio Pinza) uses a ruse to meet an attractive American woman, Frederica Brown (Lana Turner). He eventually is revealed to be Prince Alexis, an heir to the throne and a widower with a five-year-old son. He nicknames her \\"Fredda\\", so she calls him \\"Al\\". When his father becomes gravely ill, he must rush to be with him, but asks prime minister Bernand (Cedric Hardwicke) to deliver to Fredda a note of explanation. Bernand instead tells her the prince has left permanently, that this is his usual method of seducing and abandoning women. Twelve years go by. One day in Paris, a cinema's marquee makes it clear that \\"Fredda Barlo\\" is now a movie star. Fredda's former love travels to California, where film producer Paul Hunter (Barry Sullivan) is now in love with her and proposing marriage.

Reception According to MGM, the film earned $460,000 in the US and Canada and $295,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss of $1,399,000. Mr. Imperium was an entertaining film with a troubled release; it was the first of two musicals MGM attempted with South Pacific stage-star and former Metropolitan Opera singer Ezio Pinza. When previews with test audiences proved disastrous, the second film, Strictly Dishonorable, was put into general release first, but with the same unfavorable results. One of the reasons cited for the failure of Mr.Imperium was its odd title, but the real problem with the film was Pinza as leading man. On stage in South Pacific, Pinza successfully appeared as a dashing, mature leading man; On screen, he came across as less of a matinee idol, and more of a ‚Äúdirty old man,‚Äù to quote historian Donald L.

Studies on the viability of a light rail system in Tampere have been conducted since 2001 as parts of regional plans for public transport alongside heavy rail and bus solutions. In November 2016, the Tampere city council approved the plans to construct the 330-million-euro system, aiming at a 2021 completion date for the first phase (city centre to Hervanta and TAYS), and 2024 for the second (city centre to Lent√§v√§nniemi). Unlike Turku, another Finnish city that is planning a new light rail system (see Turku light rail), Tampere has not had a previously existing tram or light rail system. The construction of a tram system in Tampere was seriously studied between the years 1907 and 1929, but left unrealised due to the high price of constructing such a system. History1907‚Äì29: tram system= The first official plans for a tram system in Tampere were made in 1907, when a committee was formed to study the construction of the tram system. The study, completed in 1909, found the construction of a tram system relatively expensive, but during the first years of the next decade, it seemed that Tampere would get a tram system. Eventually, the plans were shelved due to World War I. Around the same time, plans for tram systems were also made in other Finnish cities: Turku tram was opened in 1908, Vyborg tram in 1912, while Lahti (1907‚Äì17) and Riihim√§ki (1922) also made serious studies into the matter, though their systems, too, were left unbuilt. After the war, subsequent plans for a tram system in Tampere were made as late as 1929, but these, again, were not realised. =2001‚Äì04: TramTrain= The construction of a light rail system for Tampere had been discussed since the 1970s, but the decision-makers of the city were hesitant to make any decisions without collaboration with other cities in Finland to keep down costs. In 2001, the city took the initiative in planning a light rail network when a rail traffic project group was formed to study the construction of such a system by the Finnish Ministry of Traffic & Communication, VR Group and various cities in the Greater Tampere area. The group completed its work in 2004, recommending a tram-train system utilising pre-existing railroad sections, newly built track and a tunnel section under central Tampere to avoid traffic jams. The proposed system was named TamTrain as a pun on Tram-Train. The TamTrain proposal created some criticism as existing urban areas in the region are around major roads, not railroads, and the proposed system would have, in fact, worsened public transport connections in many areas. The tunnel under the center of the city was also found problematic, as constructing such a tunnel would have forced the light rail lines to completely bypass important traffic hubs such as TAYS (Tampere University Hospital). Additionally, the tunnel section, which would have included only three stops, would have constituted 29% of the total price of the system. =TASE 2025 light rail plan= The intermediary TASE 2025 report published in 2007 recommended the creation of a light rail system running alongside major roads linking central Tampere to the suburbs of Vuores and Hervanta in phase 1 (by 2015), Lielahti and Lent√§v√§nniemi in phase 2 (2015‚Äì25), with links to Koilliskeskus, Ojala-Lamminrahka and Pirkkala in phase 3 (after 2025). In addition to the light rail system, the study recommended the creation of a commuter rail line utilising pre-existing railroad lines as well as improvements into pre-existing bus connections in areas not covered by either rail option. According to these recommendations, the initial parts of the light rail system would be opened in 2015. Although technically a light rail system, the system proposed in TASE 2025 is referred to in Finnish as katuraitiotie, \\"street tramway\\", as opposed to the term pikaraitiotie, literally \\"rapid tramway\\", which is a commonly used word for all kinds of light rail systems in Finnish, but which has been used almost exclusively for TramTrain-esque systems with a tunnel in the city centre in Tampere. The length of the proposed light rail system would be in phase 1, in phase 2 and in phase 3. The total cost of the system would be ‚Ç¨298 million. The light rail system is projected to make approximately ‚Ç¨10 million of yearly profit, whereas the current all-bus based system generates average losses of ‚Ç¨10 million every year. A subsequent intermediary report submitted on 5 March 2009 proposed four different alternatives for the future development of public transport in Tampere, all of which included the realisation of a light rail system. The initial phase in all four alternatives was the same, but the precise routes and lengths of the subsequent extensions were different. Construction The city of Tampere asked for tenders from consultants with experience in designing light rail/tram systems during the summer of 2010. The deadline for submitting tenders was on 16 August 2010, after which a consultant was chosen. The plan was that the consultant's report should be ready by the end of April 2011, after which the city council will make the decision on whether or not to proceed with the construction of a light rail system. Tram rail construction in Hervanta A final decision was made in the city council on 7 November 2016 to start construction and to purchase trams. The tram supplier will be Transtech, a Finnish subsidiary of ≈†koda Transportation.Transtech to supply Tampere trams Railway Gazette International 3 October 2016 The rail gauge will be 1435 mm, which will make vehicle purchase easier, because producers generally have developed trams for this gauge. Construction commenced in 2017 and the first phase (city centre to TAYS and Hervanta) is expected to be ready by 2021. The cost, including rolling stock, is estimated at ‚Ç¨330 million. Keolis, L√§nsilinjat and VR were shortlisted to operate the tramway, with the contract awarded to VR in April 2019 for a period of 10 years, with an option to extend for a further three years.VR Group to operate Tampere tramway Metro Report International 29 April 2019 Rolling stock Artic X34 on test drive. ≈†koda Transtech will build the rolling stock for Tampere light rail (Artic X34).

Biography  Haile Selassie Gugsa was the son of Leul Ras Gugsa Araya Selassie. Gugsa Araya Selassie was the Shum of eastern Tigray Province as well as the great grandson of Emperor Yohannes IV. =Shum of eastern Tigray= In April 1932, Gugsa Araya Selassie died and Haile Selassie Gugsa replaced him as Shum of eastern Tigray with the title of Dejazmatch. On 15 June 1932, Dejazmatch Haile Selassie Gugsa married Leult Zenebework Haile Selassie,Emperor Haile Selassie's second daughter.Mockler, Haile Sellassie's War, p. 391 He was about 25 years old and she was not quite 14 years old. Leult Zenebework died in 1934. Relations between Emperor Haile Selassie and Dejazmatch Haile Selassie Gugsa became quite cold after this. The strain between them was especially apparent when the Emperor insisted on bringing his daughter's body back to Addis Ababa for burial rather than allowing her husband to bury her in the capital of eastern Tigray, Mek'ele. This was a clear sign of Emperor Haile Selassie's unhappiness with his son-in-law. Dejazmach Haile Selassie on his part was very bitter that he was not elevated to the titles of Leul and Ras which had been held by his father before him, and were held by his rival Seyum Mengesha of western Tigray. At the same time as the marriage of Haile Selassie Gugsa to Zenebework Haile Selassie, Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen married Leult Wolete Israel Seyum, the daughter of Ras Seyum Mangasha of western Tigray Province. He was 16 years old and she was about 26 years old. The two marriages were meant to cement ties between the reigning Shoa branch of the Imperial Ethiopian dynasty with both rival sides of the Tigrean branch of the dynasty. The death of Princess Zenebework and the chill in relations between Haile Selassie Gugsa and Emperor Haile Selassie signalled the failure of this policy at least with the Eastern Tigrean branch of the dynasty.

Dejazmach Gebreselassie Bariagaber =Italo-Ethiopian War= On 3 October 1935, as Dejazmatch, Haile Selassie Gugsa was the commander in the Mek'ele sector when the Italians invaded Ethiopia. As the Italians advanced, Emperor Haile Selassie ordered Ras Seyum Mangasha, the Commander of the Ethiopian Army of Tigre, to withdraw a day's march away from the Mareb River. Later, the Emperor ordered Ras Seyum to move back fifty-five miles from the border. Dejazmach Haile Selassie Gugsa, who was also in the area, was ordered to move back thirty-five miles. This was to demonstrate to the League of Nations that Italy was clearly the aggressor. Betrayal On 10 October, Haile Selassie Gugsa went over to the advancing Italians and announced his submission to Italian rule. The Italians immediately released photographs of Haile Selassie Gugsa participating in war councils with the Italian commander on the northern front, General de Bono. Furious Tigrean patriots in Mek'ele promptly set fire to Dejazmach Haile Selassie Gugsa's home in the town. On 8 November, Mek'ele fell.Nicolle, David, The Italian Invasion of Abyssinia 1935‚Äì1936, p. 8 Some sources indicate that Haile Selassie Gugsa and his forces played an active part in aiding the Italian invasion.Time magazine, Gugsa Makes Good Other sources indicate his men were soon disarmed. Either way, Haile Selassie Gugsa remained loyal to the Italians who, at a minimum, used him for propaganda purposes during the balance of the invasion and during the five years of occupation. He was honoured by the Italians with the title of Ras which had been denied him by Emperor Haile Selassie, as well as an Italian pension, and recognition as the senior Tigrean prince over his rival Seyoum Mengesha. =Italian East Africa= In May 1938, Haile Selassie Gugsa was in Italy to welcome German dictator Adolf Hitler when the Nazi leader paid a state visit to King Victor Emmanuel III. Hitler was visiting at the invitation of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini in Rome. Haile Selassie Gugsa watched as Mussolini's son, Bruno, led a squadron of twenty-eight bombers that sank two 23,000-ton empty freighters in the Tyrrhenian Sea.Time magazine, Germany/Italy: $20,000,000 Visit By 27 September 1939, during the Feast of Maskal in Addis Ababa, Ras Haile Selassie Gugsa, Ras Hailu Tekle Haymanot, and Ras Seyum Mangasha sat with Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta, the Viceroy and Governor General of Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana, or AOI).Mockler, Haile Sellassie's War, p. xxxiv All three Ethiopian leaders had submitted to Italian control of what had been their homeland and what was now the AOI colony. =Liberation of Ethiopia= In 1941, towards the end of the liberation of Italian East Africa by British, Commonwealth, and Ethiopian Arbegnoch forces, Haile Selassie Gugsa was temporarily placed in power in Tigray by the British. British Brigadier Maurice Stanley Lush, Deputy Chief Political Officer for Ethiopia, placed him back in command of eastern Tigray Province, with the intention of separating Tigray from Ethiopia, joining it to Eritrea and establishing a new \\"Greater Tigray/Tigrign\\" monarchy under either Haile Selassie Gugsa or Ras Seyum Mangasha. This plan had the support of many British colonial officers, but not of the British High Command nor of the British government, and Ras Seyum proved to be cold towards any plan of dismembering the Ethiopian Empire. The Lush group had hoped that Haile Selassie Gugsa would be more accommodating. However, Haile Selassie Gugsa was soon caught corresponding with the Italians. As a result, the British took him into custody and kept him first in British held Asmara. The government of Emperor Haile Selassie I approached the British administration and listed the crimes and treason of Haile Selassie Gugsa and requested his extradition. The British indicated that they would extradite him only after obtaining a promise that his punishment would not include death. However, the British ultimately removed Haile Selassie Gugsa from Asmara and sent him to the Seychelles for safe keeping.Haile Selassie I, Volume II, p. 174 Life sentence In 1946, after continued requests for extradition, Haile Selassie Gugsa was returned to the Ethiopians. In 1947, he stood trial and was declared a fascist collaborator and a traitor. Haile Selassie Gugsa then threw himself on the mercy of the Emperor. As a result, his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He was placed under house arrest at Gore, and later at Ambo for twenty-eight years. His Italian-supplied honorific title of Ras was not recognised and he reverted to his old title of Dejazmach. In 1947, eastern Tigray was incorporated into western Tigray and was governed by Ras Seyum Mangasha as hereditary prince of all Tigray. Dejazmach Haile Selassie Gugsa and his side of the family of Emperor Yohannes IV fell from grace. They no longer enjoyed favour either from the Emperor in Addis Ababa or from Ras Seyum Mangasha in Tigray. =The Derg and Death= In 1974, the Derg toppled the Ethiopian monarchy and Dejazmach Haile Selassie Gugsa was freed. However, even after he was released, the Derg continued to regard him as a fascist collaborator and as a traitor to his country. Haile Selassie Gugsa remained under effective house arrest at Ambo in western Ethiopia from that point on although technically no longer a state prisoner. Haile Selassie Gugsa died in early 1985.

It primarily thrives in grassland, and is seen from May to July. Habitat and behavior Like all robber flies, the violet black-legged robber fly feed by perching on lower stems of grasses and attack prey as it flies by. The larvae usually grow up in dung piles or decaying organic matter, but they can also be in regular soil. Courting behavior involves the male leading the courtship dance in front of the female.

On April 30, 1992, following the network's expansion of coverage, DXSS-TV channel 7 was introduced of the Rainbow Satellite Network launch, which commences its nationwide satellite broadcast to bring live broadcasts from Manila-sourced national programmings via DZBB- TV, the network's flagship TV station in Manila, to viewers in the Northern Mindanao region, with the utilizes a new logo to correspond with the rebranding and a satellite-beaming rainbow in a multicolored striped based on the traditional scheme of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet, with GMA in a metallic form uses a San Serif Century Gothic Extra Bold and analogous gloominess of Indigo as its fonts in the letters. In 2009, it became a satellite station in Northern Mindanao after Bacolod, General Santos and Naga. The station's former studio is based at 2/F Hotel Conchita Building, Corner of Guillermo and Yacapin Streets. The network invested PhP 200 million for the upgrade of the station's studios and facilities and was launched on January 23, 2013 (with the branding GMA Northern Mindanao) in time for the 2013 midterm elections.http://www.sunstar.com.ph/cagayan-de- oro/business/2012/06/19/gma-network-invests-p200m-oro-station-227506 On February 5, 2013, the frequency will be moved to Channel 35, together with the launch of the Cebuano-language newscast Testigo Northern Mindanao.

History  It was one of several citadels erected by Grand Duke Gediminas of Lithuania in the early 14th century to defend his lands against the expansion of the Teutonic Knights. Other links in this chain of defense included Hrodna, Navahrudak, Kreva, Medininkai, and Trakai. The modern town of Lida, Belarus grew up around this castle. Lida Castle is above sea level.Lida Castle Altitude and Position The site selected for the castle is naturally defended by the Kamenka and Lida rivers to east and west. Construction of boulder walls was carried out in 1323, 1324, and 1325. Later they were faced with red brick. The castle had two angle towers and a church, which was moved outside the walls in 1533. The upper storeys of both towers were lived in. Despite its strong fortifications, Lida was taken by the Teutonic Knights on several occasions (1384, 1392). Lithuanian Grand Duke Vytautas gave it to his ally, Khan Tokhtamysh, who settled \\"in a yurt near the castle\\".The Castle of Lida . Retrieved on 2009-03-04 In 1406, the family of Yury of Smolensk was locked up in Lida as hostages; his attempt to take the castle and liberate them was not successful. In 1433, Lida was a point of contention between ≈†vitrigaila and his cousin Sigismund Kƒôstutaitis. The following decades were somewhat less stormy. Lida was ravaged by the Crimean Tatars in 1506 and it was stormed by the Russians during the Russo-Polish War in 1659. The Swedes, taking it twice during the Great Northern War, had both towers blown up. In 1794, the castle grounds were the site of a battle between Ko≈õciuszko's followers and the Russians. After the city fire of 1891, the south-western tower and parts of the western wall of the castle were torn down to provide stone for repairing fire-damaged houses. A team of archaeologists from St. Petersburg intervened to halt vandalism. There was only a slight restoration of the walls in the 1920s. During much of the 20th century, an itinerant zoo or circus occupied the castle compound. Every December a Christmas tree was placed within the walls. It was not until 1982 that a restoration campaign was launched. The red brick was used to denote the newly reconstructed sections, up to high. Significant restoration occurred in 2010. Each year, the Lida Castle hosts a medieval-style tournament. A museum is being created within its towers.

He started his career in the Hertfordshire county surveyor's office and served in the Royal Engineers during the First World War, constructing railways in the Middle East and being awarded the Military Cross. After the war he continued to work for local authorities before joining the Great Western Railway (GWR), where he became chief engineer by 1940. During the Second World War he served as Director-General of Aircraft Production Factories before returning to the GWR to construct military railway facilities. After the war he refused a position on the Railway Executive of the British Transport Commission as he disagreed with nationalisation of the railways. Despite this he transferred to become chief engineer of the Western Region of British Railways in 1948 and later served as an adviser to British Rail on modernisation. Quartermaine served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers for 1951‚Äì52 and was knighted in 1956. Early life and First World War Allan Stephen Quartermaine was born in London on 9 November 1888 and, after attending Highgate School, was awarded a first class honours Bachelor of Science degree in engineering at University College London, where he was a Chadwick Scholar and later a Fellow (appointed 1938). He started his engineering career in the office of the Hertfordshire county surveyor in 1908. Quartermaine served as a commissioned officer in the Royal Engineers during the First World War and worked to develop railway facilities for the troops in Egypt and Palestine. It was while carrying out this work that he was awarded the Military Cross for gallantry on 3 June 1918, at which point he was serving as a temporary captain. Quartermaine was promoted to acting major on 24 May 1919, a rank he relinquished on 15 June 1919. After the war Quartermaine returned to the Hertfordshire County Council Surveyor‚Äôs Department and later worked for Teesside's Bridge and Engineering Department. Afterwards he jointed the staff of the Great Western Railway (GWR) and rose to become assistant chief engineer. He was appointed the GWR's chief assistant engineer at Gloucester in 1920. He worked on a large number of tunnels, bridges and viaducts for the railway and was promoted to deputy chief engineer in 1929. Throughout this time Quartermaine remained liable for recall to the British Army as he was a captain of the Royal Engineers (Transportation) in the Supplementary Reserve of Officers, being promoted to major in that unit on 19 November 1924. Quartermaine resigned from the Supplementary Reserve on 1 January 1926, transferring immediately to the Regular Army Reserve of Officers while retaining his rank and association with the Royal Engineers. He reached the age limit (50) for recall to the British Army on 9 November 1938 and as of that date ceased to be a member of the reserves. Second World War Quartermaine became chief engineer of the GWR by 1940 and in June that year was appointed the government's Director-General of Aircraft Production Factories. This role was with the Ministry of Aircraft Production and would see him coordinating works to construct new factories and equip existing factories to more efficiently produce airframes, engines and other components. Quartermaine returned to the GWR in January 1941 as it had been tasked with carrying out extensive railway construction works for military purposes. Quartermaine also served in the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps, an unpaid, volunteer unit which provided technical expertise to the British Army. He was appointed Colonel in this corps on 29 October 1943 and was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the same year. Quartermaine was close to James Milne, general manager of the GWR. Milne opposed nationalisation of the railways and refused, when offered in 1948, the chairmanship of the Railway Executive of the nationalised British Transport Commission (BTC). Quartermaine who was by then the company's civil engineer and the assistant manager Keith Grand both then also refused positions with the BTC. Quartermaine having been offered a seat on the executive by Sir Cyril Hurcomb. These refusals, together with the need to balance the executive between representatives of the rail companies, meant that Frank Pope of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway was passed over in favour of David Blee who held the junior position of assistant to the chief goods manager at the GWR. After nationalisation of the railways proceeded later in 1948 he served as chief engineer of the Western Region of British Railways until 1951. In retirement Quartermaine retired from the railway in 1951 and in May that year was elected president of the Institution of Civil Engineers for the November 1951 to November 1952 session. His presidential address covered the history of the early years of railway engineering the United Kingdom. Asked his opinion on the \\"Battle of the Gauges\\" he characterised it as a question of personal differences between George Stephenson, who was a proponent of the standard gauge of four feet eight and a half inches and Isambard Kingdom Brunel who preferred his broad gauge of seven feet and a quarter inch. From 1954 Quartermain served as chairman of the British Standards Institution's Council for Codes of Practice. On 7 September Quartermaine and Geoffrey Jellicoe were appointed members of the Royal Fine Art Commission to replace William Halcrow and John Summerson respectively. In 1955 Quartermaine finally consented to join the BTC, being co-opted as a railway modernisation expert. Quartermaine was awarded a knighthood on 2 January 1956, which was conferred by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace on 10 July 1956. He served as president of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers in 1959. Quartermaine retired from the Royal Fine Arts Commission on 18 November 1960 and died on 17 October 1978.

The concept was created originally by Ian Ivarson in 1998, who was a high school student at the time. Following graduation from college, Ivarson launched IVAR in July 2006 from Marin County, California. Company background In 1998, an entrepreneurial Ian Ivarson conceived and designed an internal shelf system for backpacks with an aim to create better organization and weight distribution ergonomics. At the time, Ivarson was a high school student at Marin Catholic in Kentfield, California. Early prototypes were developed with a sewer in Berkeley, California, and eventually progressed to direct relationships with unionized factories in Asia. During early development, Ivarson also filed for patents. Until the actual launch of IVAR, development of the IVAR backpack was slow as Ivarson was a college student and student-athlete during most that time. Following graduation from the University of Denver, Ivarson launched IVAR in July 2006 with one single daypack model from an office and warehouse on Bank Street in San Anselmo, California. Over the years, IVAR‚Äôs retail distribution reached a height of over 300 retail doors. Today, the brand is sold primarily online, yet also in an array of brick and mortar retailers in the sporting goods, outdoor, luggage, and bookstore categories. As reported by the Travel Goods Showcase magazine by the Travel Goods Association, IVAR has operated with a charitable mission. The company has donated over 2,000 backpacks ($120,000+ in value) primarily to in-need youths in Africa. The IVAR-LIFT Design is patented, protected under no. 6474524.

The species is endemic to Western Australia. It is a member of the genus Pseudechis, dangerously venomous snakes that can intimidate an opponent by raising the head and presenting a hood. This cobra- like threat display is supported by the ability to produce a very large amount of venom. Taxonomy The first description of the species emerged in a study of morphological variation of the widespread species Pseudechis australis, known as the king brown or mulga snake. The author, Laurie Smith, examined a large series of specimens, allocating 213 to P. australis and 21 to the new species. The holotype is a female specimen, carrying eggs, collected at the Yalgoo region in 1963 by I. C. Carnaby. The suggestion of a cryptic Pseudechis species in the midwest was noticed by Ludwig Glauert in 1957, but with few available specimens the author hesitated to describe it as a new taxon.Glauert, L. (1957). Handbook of the Snakes of Western Australia. Western Australian Naturalists‚Äô Club. Handbook No. 1, Perth. The morphological comparison by Smith concluded the closest affinity was with the type of the genus, P. porphyriacus, the red-bellied Pseudechis of Australia's eastern states. A revision of the phylogeny of 'black snake' genus several years later found instead that this species was most closely related to P. australis in finer details of morphology, a position supported by comparison of results from electrophoretic analysis of blood proteins and phylogenetic indicators. Common names for P. butleri include Butler's black snake, Butler's snake,\\"Pseudechis butleri \\". The Reptile Database. www.reptile-database.org. and spotted mulga snake. The generic name, Pseudechis, suggests a similarity to the African-Asian vipers of the genus Echis. The specific epithet, butleri, commemorates the conservation efforts of naturalist W. H. \\"Harry\\" Butler.Beolens, Bo; Michael Watkins; Michael Grayson (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Pseudechis butleri, p. 44). Description A species of Pseudechis, a genus of large front-fanged venomous snakes occurring in Australia and New Guinea. The species is similar to the common mulga P. australis, a larger and widespread snake which occurs in sympatry at parts of central Western Australia. However, Pseudechis butleri is spotted with yellow or yellow-green scales and does not usually exceed a total length (including tail) of 1.6 metres. The snout to vent length (SVL) is up to 1.56 metres, the tail's length is around 15% of the SVL. The dorsal scales of the body are occasionally all black, but most of the upper body is covered in yellow or brownish scales with black bases. The colour of the head and neck tends to completely black. The neck is slightly defined by the species head, broad and slightly larger the robust body. Pseudechis butleri is readily distinguished from others of the genus, by coloration and number of scales at the ventral side. The number of scale rows at the midbody is 17, at the neck this is usually 19, but ranges from 16 to 23, and 17 (15‚Äì18) rows at the tail. Pseudechis australis has reddish-brown scales with a creamy coloured edge on the lower part of the body, whereas this species has black-based scales with bright yellow. The number of ventral scales is also less than specimens of P. australis found at the same latitude, 204‚Äì216 compared to the range 189‚Äì207 for P. butleri. The yellow colour of ventral scales is pink or red in the black snake of Eastern Australia, Pseudechis porphyriacus, which also fewer scales than this species. The lighter spots of this species was described by Glauert, when examining a recently killed specimen, as \\"primrose yellow\\". Distribution and habitat The distribution range of P. butleri is within the Murchison region of Western Australia, where it occurs in Acacia woodlands on stony and loamy soils, and occasionally amongst rocks. Specimens of this West Australian endemic species have been recorded in Mullewa in the north, as far south as Leonora, and to the east near Laverton. Venom The venom of P. butleri contains systemic myotoxins. Treatment for positive envenomation is the same as for P. australis, using a black snake antivenom.

With a plan of the future city of Washington In Repository of the Library of Congress Geography and Map Division, Washington, D.C. in front of her, Martha Washington is, according to Savage's catalogue, \\"pointing with her fan to the grand avenue\\". Some descriptions of the painting state that the \\"grand avenue\\" is Pennsylvania Avenue. . However, the broadest and most prominent \\"grand avenue\\" that the city plan illustrates has actually become the National Mall (see: L'Enfant Plan).(1) (2) (3) (4) . Note: L'Enfant's key to the federal city's plan states that \\"H\\" is the \\"Grand Avenue, 400 feet in breadth, and about a mile in length, ....\\". This feature is now the National Mall. (5) Holding a caliper, young George's right hand rests near the top of the globe, which lacks geographical markings. A museum's description interprets this portion of the scene as representing American hopes for rising global significance. . A researcher has found that the perspective of the painting terminates at George Washington's heart. . An oil painting by Peter Waddell entitled A Vision Unfolds debuted in 2005 within an exhibition on Freemasonry that the Octagon House's museum in Washington, D.C., was hosting. The painting was again displayed in 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2011, first in the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, Nebraska and later in the National Heritage Museum in Lexington, Massachusetts and in the Scottish Rite Center of the District of Columbia in Washington, D.C.

Plot summary Nora Taylor has a fortune worth $37 million, but fears men only want her for her money. The current man in her life is Paul Chevron, who is even wealthier than she is. Paul delays further discussion of marriage until he returns from a trip to Brazil to play polo. After hearing that men who go to Brazil often fall for the beautiful women there, Nora decides to fly there and surprise Paul, taking along trusty secretary Anne. It is she who meets a new romantic interest, dashing Roberto Santos, who sweeps her off her feet. Once again, though, Nora is concerned about whether it's her or her riches that attracts him, so she announces her intention to give away all her money. Roberto is unhappy about that, so Nora leaves him. Having remained calm during Nora's distraction with a new man, Paul returns to the U.S. and proposes marriage to her. Nora realizes she is not in love with him and says so. Anne surprisingly declares her own love for Paul, saying when it comes to the heart, money shouldn't matter. Nora comes to her senses and returns to Roberto, saying she still intends to give all her money away, but to him.

One hundred and eighty two (TID-1 to TID-12 and TID-14 to TID-183) were built for the Ministry of War Transport. Manufacture Richard Dunston Ltd., a shipbuilding company with yards at Thorne on the Stainforth and Keadby Canal and at Hessle on the Humber, had pioneered the use of welded construction, rather than the more conventional rivetting, since 1933, although they had never built an all-welded vessel. An order for 12 tugs in 1942 was the opportunity to try such a design. They designed the hulls so that they could be made up from eight separate sections, which were fabricated by manufacturers with spare welding capacity. Shipbuilders with spare capacity were in short supply at the time, but other non-shipbuilding industry was available. Each of the sections was a maximum of by by , and weighed less than 6 tons, so that they could be transported by road to the Thorne yard. At the yard, the sections were fitted together by welders, many of whom were women, and the engines were installed. The first tug was ready for despatch in February 1943, and for more than a year, one left the yard every five days. The first 90 tugs built were fitted with coal- fired boiler, while subsequent ones were oil-fired. Dunston's built a total of 159 TID tugs, of which 152 were built at Thorne and seven at Hessle. These were supplemented by 23 which were built at the yard of William Pickersgill & Co., of Sunderland. Several of the oil-fired tugs were shipped to the Far East as deck cargo on larger vessels.

Biography El Bersheh (1893) by Percy Newberry Percy Newberry was born in Islington, London on 23 April 1869. His mother was named Caroline Wyatt, and his father, Henry James Newberry, was a woollen warehouseman. Newberry developed a strong attachment to botany in childhood and was also an excellent artist. He studied first at King's College School and later at King's College London. In 1884, on the invitation of Reginald Stuart Poole, Newberry began administrative work at the Egypt Exploration Fund, founded just two years previously. He continued in this role until 1886, and afterwards began his own research in Egyptology. In 1891 Newberry travelled to Egypt with Howard Carter, whom Newberry had appointed as a trainee tracer, after recognising his talent as an artist. There they worked on the excavation of Beni Hasan and El-Bersheh, which Newberry led from 1890 to 1894. Newberry later served on the Tutankhamun excavation team for several seasons. His speciality was the botanical specimens from the tomb, on which he would briefly report in the second volume of Carter's The Tomb of Tut.ankh.Amen. Newberry was the first Brunner Professor of Egyptology at the University of Liverpool, serving in the chair from 1906 to 1919. He was then an honorary Reader in Egyptian Art (1919 to 1949). He was also a fellow of King's College, London, (1908 to 1949), and Professor of Ancient History and Archaeology at Cairo University (1929 and 1933). He died in Godalming, Surrey, on 7 August 1949.

Napoleon Bonaparte established the first central Jewish consistory in France, and ordered regional ones to be set up in turn. The political emancipation of the Jews required the creation of a representative body that could transact official business with a government in the name of the Jews. The Jews in countries under French influence during the Napoleonic period often also established consistories. In addition, in this period, the educated classes desired religious reform and supported the creation of a body vested with authority to render religious decisions. France Napoleon I established the first Jewish consistory. In 1806 he convened the Assembly of Jewish Notables, whose resolutions were confirmed by a subsequently convened Grand Sanhedrin. By decree of March 17, 1808, he organized a consistory. According to this decree, every department containing 2,000 Jews might establish a consistory. Departments having fewer than this number might combine with others; but no department had more than one consistory. Above these provincial consistories, there was a central consistory. Every consistory consisted of a grand rabbi, with another rabbi where possible, and three lay members, two of whom were residents of the town where the consistory sat. They were elected by twenty- five \\"notables,\\" who were nominated by the French authorities. Thus Israelite French consistories were, like their Protestant namesakes, parastatal entities to represent these religious minorities to the administration, which in return used to control them. Eligible to become members of the consistory were Israelites who had reached the age of thirty years, who had never been bankrupt, nor practised usury. The central consistory consisted of three grand rabbis and two lay members. Every year one grand rabbi retired, and the remaining members elected his successor. Napoleon demanded that the consistories should ensure that resolutions passed by the Assembly of Notables and confirmed by the Sanhedrin should be enforced by the rabbis. He required the following: proper decorum should be maintained in the synagogue; Jews should take up mechanical trades (to replace usury); and the leaders should ensure that no young men evaded military service. The central consistory watched over the consistories of the various departments, and had the right to appoint the rabbis. French dependencies Napoleon's administration introduced the concept of the consistory to the various countries which were under the sway of France during his era and where Jews had been emancipated, such as Belgium (French-annexed from 1794 to 1814), and the client states of Holland and Westphalia. Napoleon's youngest brother, J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, ruled over Westphalia, where he established the by decree of March 31, 1808. It was composed of a president (who could be either a rabbi or a layman), three rabbis, two lay members, and one secretary. Consistorial President Israel Jacobson was largely responsible for establishing this, as he hoped to use it to introduce his own ideas about Reform Judaism. The consistory ordered the introduction of confirmation for Jewish youths and removed the prohibition against consumption of leguminous plants on Passover. With the exception of the consistory in Belgium, none of these organizations survived the Napoleonic era. Counter-revolutions in the countries formerly under French influence resulted in governments re-establishing discriminatory laws against the Jews. During the middle of the nineteenth century, various Jewish communities worked to introduce either a consistory or a synod which should, by an authoritative vote, settle the difficulties which arose when the demands of the time came into conflict with the traditional Halakah law. Some members of the Jewish communities wanted reform, but others resisted change. None of these attempts was successful. 19th century Since Napoleon's 1808 decree, the Consistory in France has changed. Members changed the method of electing the delegates, and dropped provisions assigning the rabbis secondary roles as government informers. In the later 19th century, Louis Philippe (May 25, 1844) and Napoleon III (June 15, 1850, and August 29, 1862) made significant changes. In 1871 the ambits of the three consistories in Colmar, Metz and Strasbourg became part of Alsace-Lorraine outside the supervision of the Central Consistory. They were not under any other common umbrella. However, the three consistories remained concordatary religious bodies and were entitled to nominate together one representative for the upper house of the parliament of Alsace-Lorraine, as did other recognised religious bodies. After French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, Alsace-Lorraine was ceded to Prussia. The French law of December 12, 1872, introduced the system of universal suffrage in elections of the consistories. In the beginning of the 20th century, there were twelve consistories: Paris, Nancy, Bordeaux, Lyon, Marseilles, Bayonne, Epinal, Lille, Besan√ßon, Algier, Constantine, and Oran. Each has the grand rabbi of the consistorial district and six lay members, with a secretary. Each consistory has a representative in the Central Consistory, which is composed of twelve members and the Grand Rabbi of France; its seat is in Paris. 20th century By the 1905 French law on the Separation of Religions and the State, the Israelite consistories in France lost their status as √©tablissements publics du culte (public-law corporations of cult). With the defeat of Germany in World War I, in 1919 the three Israelite consistories in Alsace-Moselle returned to French jurisdiction. Their concordatary status has since been preserved in what is now called the local law in Alsace-Moselle. They retain their status as parastatal entities.

It serves as the base for studies on limnology and biology of aquatic organisms aimed at developing strategies for the optimum utilization and sustained production of aquatic resources; developing, adapting or improving conventional technologies used to increase fish production; and promoting environment friendly approaches for effective water management. HistoryPre-War= The idea of institutionalizing a Limnological Station began as a result of collaboration between Dr. Leopoldo B. Uichanco, professor and head of the Department of Entomology of the then UP College of Agriculture and Albert William Herre, then Chief of Fisheries Division, Bureau of Science, Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources on ‚ÄòDolong‚Äô, a species of goby that can be found in Laguna de Bay (Ref: Letter of Albert W. Herre to Dr. L.B. Uichangco dated January 19, 1926, UPLB LRS archive # 1). On August 17, 1928, the UP College of Agriculture Limnological Research and Aquatic Resources Management Center was established with Proclamation No. 176 signed by Governor General Henry L. Stimson (Gov. Gen from Dec. 27, 1927 to February 23, 1929) as its backbone and maintained as a facility under the Department of Entomology. Under Dr. L.B. Uichangco‚Äôs diligent efforts, more researches on aquatic animals and more courses in Zoology were instituted. Dr. Deogracias V. Villadolid, upon his return after getting his Ph.D. in Aquatic Biology from Stanford University in 1927, Zoology was no longer a mere background to entomology. Dr. Villadolid, who became head of the station more than any other, was responsible for the enhanced development of fisheries in the Philippines. Dr. Villadolid together with Messrs. Andres M. Mane and F. Alonte eventually left the department in 1934 and transferred to the Bureau of Fisheries now known as the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) and served as its Director, and later became an aquatic biologist of the Fish and Game Administration (Gabriel, 1979), operations of the station naturally ceased. Since then, work has not been resumed primarily due to lack of funds and low priority assigned to the activity in addition to the onset of World War II in 1941. =World War II= World War II brought the Department back to almost where it was in 1909. Cendana (1959) narrated that during the Japanese occupation, it was impossible to do any kind of research work. But instruction went on throughout the war years, although only two courses, Zoology 1 and Entomology 1, could be offered. During the end of war, retreating Japanese soldiers burned the Entomology Building on February 23, 1945. With it was burned everything that took the Department 32 years to accumulate including extensive insect and zoological collections, irreplaceable biological notes, valuable books and all the equipment. =Post-War= The UP College of Agriculture was re-opened in June 1945, with Dean L.B. Uichanco as the concurrent head of the Department of Entomology. Upon the establishment of the College of Arts and Humanities (renamed on October 28, 1977 College of Arts and Sciences) on December 21, 1972, Zoology became one of its seven initial departments. When the programs in Hydrozoology and Wildlife Zoology were instituted, the need to reactivate and bring the Station back to its real potentials consequently started. In 1975, an ad hoc committee for the reactivation of the Station was formed with Dr. Cesar P. Madamba of the Department of Zoology, CAS as Chairman. Members of the committee were Dr. W.P. David, Dr. B.L. Cariaso, Dr. B.P. Gabriel, Dr. V.J. Calilung and Dr. C.R. Barril. They initiated plans and activities for the research station at the University level. After the construction of the new Station, an ad hoc committee was formed to conceptualize research plans and other developments regarding aquatic resources management, also with Dr. Madamba as Chairman with the original five members of the reactivation committee and Mr. Batoon from ACCI as an addition. The Station was renamed UPLB Limnological Research Station. At the time it was reserved, the Station ground directly bordered Laguna de Bay. However, there has been built up - as a result in part of the accumulation of sand and shell by constant wave action and in part of the recession of the lake's water - a foreshore accretion between the original reservation and the Lake. Since the Station's research activities in the waters of the Lake cannot very well be carried out without direct access to it, the Station's premises were extended, as the waters of the Lake receded, to this accretion area. Aware of the need for a Freshwater Research Center, then Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos proclaimed the Reservation Area under Proclamation No. 1678, thereby amending Proclamation No. 176, signed at UPLB on October 10, 1977 making the Station's total land area at 4.077 hectares. =Present= The UPLB Limnological Research Station (popularly called Limno Station or just Limno) is being managed by the Animal Biology Division, Institute of Biological Sciences, College of Arts and Sciences. The Station has a total land area of 4.78 ha. situated at the foreshore of Laguna de Bay in Barangay Mayondon, Los Ba≈àos Laguna. On January 28, 1994, the Station was identified and established as the National Center for Inland Waters Research and Development by the Philippine Council for Aquatic and Marine Research and Development-Department of Science and Technology (PCAMRD-DOST). The Station is also the seat of PCAMRD-DOST's Southern Luzon Zonal Center for Aquatic and Marine R&D; (Zonal Center 2). The UPLB Limnological Research Station once again plays an important role in the fisheries sector through the leadership of their Station Manager, Dr. Pablo P. Ocampo, paving the way towards achieving its goals to: (1) develop optimum utilization and sustained production of aquatic resources; (2) conduct limnological studies; (3) conduct training and extension activities on different aspects of aquarium fish production; (4) develop culture technique for live feeds; (5) develop new aquarium varieties from indigenous fish species; and, (6) conduct captive breeding on some selected endemic/endangered freshwater fish species.

Ocampo Fish Ark Philippines: Direction for the Conservation of Native and Endemic Philippine Freshwater Fishes, a program funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) through the Philippine Council for Aquatic and Marine Research and Development (PCAMRD), with an overall objectives in line with the Philippine Strategy for Biological Conservation, the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan and the Provisions No. 24 of Republic Act 9147 (otherwise known as the Philippine Conservation and Protection Act). The program will also address gaps in our knowledge of the species richness of freshwater aquatic fauna and inland ecosystems, particularly from inland waters. The main goals of the program are the following: (1) to develop an equip aqua laboratory where threatened and endangered native or endemic freshwater fishes can be provided with safe refuge until such time that adequate and protected natural habitat can be established; (2) to establish a self-sustaining captive breeding program and produce adequate breeding stock as backup populations, and attempt to develop techniques to prepare animals for re-introduction; (3) to document the status of different freshwater species in the wild, and set priorities for species to be conserved or re-introduced; and, (4) to develop information delivery systems that would underscore conservation education and public awareness that can create local support necessary in sustaining re-introduction efforts. The program has four component projects: * Component Project I: Survey of Diminutive Freshwater Fishes Indigenous to Isolated Crater Lakes, Mountain Streams and Cataracts in Southern Luzon, Philippines (Project Leader: Dr. Vachel Gay V. Paller) * Component Project II: Captive Breeding of the Native and Endemic Diminutive Freshwater Fishes (Project Leader: Dr. Pablo P.

His name suggests that he was not a native Englishman, and perhaps was German or Norman. He first appears in history as a witness to a royal document in 1050, and remained a royal chaplain and clerk throughout the rest of King Edward's reign. Many royal documents give Regenbald the title of \\"chancellor\\" but whether this means that he acted in a manner similar to the later Lord Chancellor is unclear, as some of the documents may be forgeries or have been tampered with. Whatever Regenbald's actual title, King Edward rewarded him with lands and also granted him the status, but not the actual office, of bishop. Regenbald continued to serve the English kings after the Norman Conquest of England, although whether he served King Harold II of England is unclear. His date of death is unknown, but it was probably during the reign of either King William I or William II. After his death, some of his lands became part of the endowment of Cirencester Abbey in 1133. Early life His origins are unknown, but he was probably not a native Englishman. He may have been German or Norman. The historian Katharine Keats-Rohan suggests that he was possibly the nephew of Peter, who was the Bishop of Chester and a Norman.Keats-Rohan Domesday People p. 351 His name was a German or French name, which suggests that Regenbald was one of the foreigners that gained favour with King Edward the Confessor.Keynes \\"Regenbald\\" Anglo-Norman Studies X p. 195 Service to Edward the Confessor Regenbald first appears in the historical record in 1050, when he witnesses a charter of King Edward. King Edward gave him large estates as a reward for his service to the king as a royal chaplain.Barlow Edward the Confessor p. 150 The Domesday Book records him owning at least seven churches, but only two of them have any indication that he performed any ecclesiastical services personally.Evans \\"Cirencester's Early Church\\" Transactions p. 116 Another royal reward was the grant to Regenbald of the status, without the actual office, of a bishop.Barlow Edward the Confessor p. 179 He probably was unable to be promoted to a bishopric, either because he was married or because his style of life was known to be unchaste. In royal charters he is often given the title \\"royal chancellor\\",Barlow Edward the Confessor p. 164 as he is styled in a 1062 charter in Latin regis cancellarius, but this does not necessarily mean that there was an official office known as chancellor similar to the later Lord Chancellor's office.Barlow English Church 1000‚Äì1066 p. 121Douglas William the Conqueror pp. 292‚Äì293 Regenbald was probably in charge of Edward's royal clerks and scribes,Loyn Governance p. 185 but his position in the witness lists argues against his holding an actual office, as he is not listed early in the witness lists along with the magnates. He probably performed some of the duties that later were done by the chancellor, but the first chancellor in England is usually held to be Herfast, who held office from around 1069.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 82 Some historians, including David Bates, hold that Regenbald was chancellor, however.Bates William the Conqueror p. 173 Some support for that position is the fact that Domesday Book lists Regenbald as \\"chancellor\\".Chrimes Introduction pp. 16‚Äì17 footnote 2 The entire issue of whether Regenbald was a \\"true\\" chancellor or not is bound up in the debate amongst medievalists about whether there was a recognisable chancery in England prior to the Norman Conquest. One school of thought, led by Pierre Chaplais, argues that no such office existed prior to the Conquest. Another group argues that there was, and among this group is the historian Simon Keynes.Keynes \\"Regenbald\\" Anglo-Norman Studies X pp. 185‚Äì187 In Regenbald's case, a number of the documents that give him the title \\"chancellor\\" are either forgeries or have been altered in the copying process. Others, however, are not easily shown to be spurious.Keynes \\"Regenbald\\" Anglo-Norman Studies X pp. 197‚Äì198 Besides his scribal duties, he also served as a royal judge, as he is recorded as passing judgement in a case late in Edward's or early in William's reign, along with Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester, and √Üthelwig, Abbot of Evesham.Barlow English Church 1000‚Äì1066 p. 147 footnote 4 A thirteenth- century source says that he was dean of the church at Cirencester during William's reign. Regenbald remained at the royal court throughout Edward's reign and into the reign of King William the Conqueror.Barlow English Church 1000‚Äì1066 p. 129 His lands and possessions were confirmed by King William after the Norman Conquest. Whether he served King Harold in the period after King Edward's death is unknown, as no royal charters and only one royal writ survive from Harold's reign.Keynes \\"Regenbald\\" Anglo-Norman Studies X p. 217 Regenbald's lands are recorded in a charter from the reign of King Henry I of England which dealt with the gift of those lands after Regenbald's death. This charter lists a number of estates as owned by Regenbald that were also listed in Domesday Book as Regenbald's, but there are a few other possessions that did not get recorded in Domesday. The lands listed include lands in Gloucestershire, Berkshire, Wiltshire, Somerset, Northamptonshire, Worcestershire, and Dorset. Domesday lists the value of Regenbald's lands at ¬£40 per year.Keynes \\"Regenbald\\" Anglo-Norman Studies X p. 196 His estates totalled about 90 hides, although some of the estates were given to him after the Norman Conquest.Barlow English Church 1000‚Äì1066 pp. 134‚Äì135 Death and legacy Presumably, he died either during the reign of William I or during the following reign of William II. Possibly, he was buried at Cirencester, where a stone tomb in the crypt of the Saxon-era church still exists and may be his. After his death, a group of his lands became the basis for the foundation of Cirencester Abbey by King Henry I of England in 1133.Evans \\"Cirencester's Early Church\\" Transactions pp. 117‚Äì118 Regenbald's brother held land near him in Cirencester. Regenbald had a son named Edward who also held lands in Gloucester.

The film exposes the manoeuvring and corruption of Indian electioneering. A young man is happy to hear the news that the local candidate would offer money for electing him. This money would help him to marry, but he sacrifices the money for an ailing beggar. The story is told through the struggles of several poor villagers of the Indian state of Orissa, each of whom have one of two choices: either working the soil for a wealthy landowner, or \\"dynamiting\\" the hills in one of the new quarries‚Äîa portrayal of how low humanity can descend when penury and desperation chip away at the social veneer. The film was selected for the Indian Panorama, International Film Festival of India (IFFI) 1996, Delhi. http://theory.tifr.res.in/~sgupta/others/films95.html  Synopsis  In this drama, set within an impoverished village in the state of Orissa, a village chieftain hatches an ingenious but morally bankrupt plot to raise enough dowry so that one of his daughters can marry. The townsfolk have two choices for work: they can become farmers or work in the quarries of the richest man around Zaminder. The quarry work is lucrative but destructive to the local environment and to the health of the people forced to breathe in rock dust. The town is in the process of electing a new village chief and to ensure that he is elected, Zaminder pays villagers money for their votes. The chief's family decides to adopt the town beggar, who is dying of tuberculosis. They promise the beggar that they will see that he is cured if he will hand over his vote money. The deal is struck and the chief and his son take him upon the long journey to get cured. Unfortunately, it is a struggle to keep the dying fellow alive until the election and in the end unexpected tragedy ensues.

Holliday attended Okehampton College, then studied at the University of Nottingham, and gained a bachelor's degree in Mining Engineering in 1978. Holliday was elected in 2010, as a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering Career Holliday joined Exxon in 1978, where he worked for 19 years until 1997, gaining experience in all aspects of the oil and gas industry. Holliday was made operations manager of the Fawley Refinery near Southampton in the UK when he was 30 years old. In 1998, when British Borneo merged with Hardy Oil and Gas, Holliday became the international director. Holliday joined the National Grid Group as the board director responsible for the UK and Europe, in March 2001. Following the merger of National Grid Group plc and Lattice Group plc in October 2002, he took responsibility for the Group's electricity and gas transmission businesses. In 2003, Holliday was promoted from group director (responsible for Worldwide Transmission Operations) to group director responsible for the UK Gas Distribution and Business Services. Holliday was also appointed the chief executive of Transco. Holliday became chief executive officer (CEO) of National Grid plc in January 2007.

One of its most well-known products is Purell, a hand sanitizer. It offers an electronic hand hygiene monitoring system for medical institutions.  History  GOJO was founded in Akron, Ohio, by Jerry and Goldie Lippman. During World War II, Goldie worked at the Miller Tire Co. rubber factory and Jerry at the Goodyear Aircraft plant. Like other employees there, both often came home with sticky, difficult-to-remove graphite, tar, and carbon on their hands and clothes. They disliked the products the cleaners used to clean their clothes, so they set out to find an effective cleaning product that could be used without water. Goldie and Jerry worked with Professor Clarence Cook of Kent State University‚Äôs chemistry department to formulate a heavy-duty hand cleaner. They called it GOJO Hand Cleaner and sold it to rubber workers, who had sometimes used benzene and other noxious chemicals to clean their skin. After the war they began marketing to automotive service facilities. They quit their factory jobs and started GOJO. The company's first name and product was GoGo, Goldie's nickname, but another company had already used the name, so the founders came up with GOJO, with the \\"G\\" standing for Goldie and the \\"J\\" standing for Jerry. In 1950, GOJO invented a liquid soap dispenser after realizing that users were using much more than was needed to clean their hands, causing buyers to think the product was too expensive. Jerry Lipmann filed a patent for this portion-limiting dispenser in 1952. The original product was meant to clean, not sanitize the skin. In 1988, the company developed the Purell product to disinfect hands. In 2004, GOJO sold Pfizer the exclusive rights to distribute Purell in the consumer market, while GOJO Industries retained the rights to existing industrial markets. In 2006, Pfizer sold its Consumer Healthcare division, and hence the rights to Purell, to Johnson & Johnson. In 2010, GOJO bought the brand back from Johnson & Johnson. In February 2014, GOJO Industries acquired privately held Laboratoires Prodene Klint of Croissy-Beaubourg, France. The acquisition allows both companies greater geographic footprint and increased manufacturing operations. Prodene Klint manufactures professional hygiene, cosmetics and disinfectant products. On June 6, 2015, GOJO launched its GOJO SMARTLINK Observation System, a mobile application that connects to GOJO SMARTLINK web-based software and allows for the electronic collection and collation of hand hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE) compliance metrics. On 1 January, 2020, Carey Jaros became Gojo president and CEO. Operations GOJO headquarters GOJO operates worldwide, with offices in the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Japan, and Brazil. It has factories in Ohio and across North America, as well as in Latin America, South America, Europe, and Asia. GOJO's main manufacturing and distribution facilities are at its Lippman Campus in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. =Ownership= GOJO is a private, family-owned company. In 1946, GOJO was founded by Jerome \\"Jerry\\" Lippman and Goldie Lippman. Today, Joseph Kanfer runs the company of his uncle and aunt, along with other family members. Kanfer's eldest daughter, Marcella Kanfer Rolnick, is vice chairwoman of GOJO's board. Marcella Kanfer Rolnick also runs The Lippman Kanfer Family Foundation focused on Jewish philanthropy and its sister organization Lippman Kanfer Foundation for Living Torah, along with other family members. =Products= GOJO manufactures and markets skin health and hygiene solutions for away-from-home settings. Its products include hand soaps and sanitizers, moisturizers, shower washes, shampoos, foam hand washes, surgical scrubs, perineal care products, skin conditioners, chemical removing hand cleaners, hand protection products, and dispensers. GOJO's products are usually found in public facilities. For many of these facilities, such as manufacturing and hospitals, GOJO makes placement guides, helping consumers place various GOJO product brands in strategic locations. GOJO's most popular products are its industrial hand soaps and sanitizers, as well as its Provon and Purell brands. =Headquarters= GOJO's main office is a building at One Gojo Plaza on South Main Street in Akron, Ohio. The company bought the property from the City of Akron for $1 in 2000 as part of a deal to bring its headquarters to downtown Akron from Cuyahoga Falls. Originally the headquarters of Goodrich Corporation and then Michelin Americas Small Tires, the building now holds about 600 GOJO employees.

Vacancy The by-election was caused by the death of the sitting Liberal National Member of Parliament, Joseph Leckie. CandidatesLiberal National= The Liberal Nationals selected Sir George Schuster. Schuster was something of a renaissance man. He had qualified as a barrister and had already had successful careers in business, colonial government and economics. He came from a wealthy family with banking and cotton interests. As a representative of the National Government Schuster was not opposed by the Conservatives, although they were apparently disappointed the Liberal Nationals exercised their right to find their own successor to Leckie and did not cede the National nomination to the local Conservatives.K J Dean, Town and Westminster: A Political History of Walsall from 1906-1945; Borough of Walsall, 1971 p169-170 Schuster later went on to spend 22 years on Oxfordshire County Council and achieve success in the field of further education as Chairman of the Board of Governors of Atlantic College from 1963-1973.Who was Who, OUP 2007 He died in 1982 aged 101 years.The Times, 8 June 1982 p12 =Labour= Schuster was therefore opposed only by the Labour Party candidate, George Jeger, a journalist from London and a local councillor in Shoreditch, of which he was mayor in 1938. Jeger had been Labour candidate in Bethnal Green South West at the 1935 general election. He went on to represent Winchester (1945‚Äì1950) and Goole (1950‚Äì1971) in Parliament. Issues As the National candidate, Schuster sought to defend the record of the National Government and in particular the foreign policy associated with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. The great issue of the day was the worsening of international relations with the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany, Benito Mussolini in Italy and Japanese expansionism in the Far East. Chamberlain‚Äôs policy of appeasing these dissatisfied powers, in the immediate glow of what was thought to be Chamberlain‚Äôs success in getting the Munich Agreement signed at the end of September, was the one that Schuster, and those in the government supporting him, chose to emphasise.The Times, 9 November 1938 p9 He also attacked the Labour Party for its support of economic planning and state regulation at the expense of small business and local enterprise and for its allegation that the government planned further cuts in social welfare provision. However, the main issue was for the electors of Walsall to show their approval or rejection of the Munich Agreement.Dean, Town and Westminster; p 174 For Labour, George Jeger attacked the government‚Äôs record on international and domestic policy. He was reported in the local press as saying that the National Government was not firm enough in its stand for peace and had failed the League of Nations but he also criticised the government‚Äôs re-armament policy as taking funds away from essential social services.Dean, Town and Westminster; p 173 Jeger attacked Chamberlain‚Äôs efforts at Munich saying that forcing Czechoslovakia to hand over the Sudetenland merely encouraged further aggression by Hitler and sacrificed a democratic country in the face of Nazi blackmail.The Times, 16 November 1938 p8 The Times headline over its by-election coverage of 14 November summed it up ‚Äì‚ÄòWalsall Contest ‚Äì Foreign Policy the Main Issue'.The Times, 14 November 1938 p19 The votesReferencesSee also *List of United Kingdom by-elections *United Kingdom by-election records Category:1938 elections in the United Kingdom Category:By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Staffordshire constituencies Category:1938 in England Category:Politics of Walsall Category:20th century in Staffordshire ","title":"1938 Walsall by-election"},{"id":"21745759","text":"Silver Run is an unincorporated community in Wicomico County, Maryland, United States.

She received the Kossuth Prize in 1951 and 1952. Life Kl√°ri Tolnay (born R√≥zsi Tolnay) was born on 17 July 1914 in Budapest, as the daughter of Istv√°n Tolnay and Eleon√≥ra Siess. She spent her childhood in the small village of Mohora, N√≥gr√°d county, on the estate of her father. Finishing elementary school there, she continued secondary school studies in Balassagyarmat, two years at the school operated by Institutum Beatae Mariae Virginis in Ny√≠regyh√°za, finishing high school in Debrecen's School of Business. Singing and playing music since childhood, she followed the advice of newspaper editor J√°nos B√≥kay, and auditioned herself to prominent actors of the time, G√°bor Rajnai, Jen≈ë Heltai, and S√°ndor Hevesi. After these early attempts were not followed by desired results, she was mentored by B√©la Ga√°l, thus starting her career as a film actress at the Hunnia Film Studio. Her first notable role was in Meseaut√≥, after which she was hired by the V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z theatre in 1934, to perform smaller roles. In 1936 she married √Åkos R√°thonyi, a director, giving birth to daughter Zsuzsanna 4 years later. After World War II ended in 1945, √Åkos R√°thonyi left Hungary, with their daughter following after the 1956 revolution. Leaving the V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z for the M≈±v√©sz Theatre in 1946-7, she met Iv√°n Darvas, whom she later married (but divorced in 1958). In 1947, together with Gyula Benk≈ë and Istv√°n Soml√≥, she was appointed as the co-manager of the V√≠gsz√≠nh√°z theatre, where she was a major participant in restoring the institution to its pre-war glory. After the theatre was disbanded by the government in 1950, she joined the Mad√°ch Theatre, where she worked until her death on 27 October 1998.

The other six were: Dziadoszanie, Golƒôszyce, ≈ölƒô≈ºanie, Trzebowianie, Bobrzanie and Lupiglaa (often identified with G≈Çubczyce). The name Opolans derives from a Slavic term opole, that meant a specific form of self-governing used among the West Slavs. Early medieval opole transformed into an administrative governing form used in Early Medieval Poland mainly to collect taxes. According to the Geographer Opolans possessed 20 gords in what was later known as Upper Silesia such as Opole and Toszek. Presumably their place of cult was the Saint Anna mountain. Opolanie's territories were conquered by Great Moravia in 875 and were probably incorporated into the P≈ôemyslid Bohemia in the first half of the 10th century. In 990 Opolans' territories were incorporated into the first Polish state. Due to this fact they are usually treated as part of the Polish tribes.

She married Thomas Law, the youngest son of the late bishop of Carlisle, England, and an experienced administrator with the East India Company. Elizabeth P. (Custis) Law became a social leader in the District of Columbia, and she worked to preserve the Washington family heritage. She and Law separated in 1804 and divorced in 1811. They had one daughter who survived and three grandchildren. She was known for her fierce temper. Early life Elizabeth Parke Custis was born on 21 August 1776. She was the eldest daughter of John Parke Custis, the son of Martha Washington and her first husband, Daniel Parke Custis; and his wife Eleanor Calvert, daughter of Benedict Swingate Calvert and his wife Elizabeth Calvert. She was also the eldest grandchild of Martha Washington and step-grandchild of President George Washington. Elizabeth's siblings included Martha Parke Custis Peter (1777‚Äì1854), Eleanor (Nelly) Parke Custis Lewis (1779‚Äì1852), and George Washington Parke Custis (1781‚Äì1857). She was known to her family as \\"Betsey.\\" During their early childhood, the four children were raised at the Abingdon plantation, which their father had purchased. After the 1781 death of their father, the eldest two daughters (Elizabeth and Martha) continued to live with their mother at Abingdon. The two youngest children (Nelly and George) moved to Mount Vernon to live with George and Martha Washington. In 1783, their widowed mother Eleanor Calvert Custis married Dr. David Stuart (1753‚Äì1814), an Alexandria, physician and business associate of George Washington. Dr. Stuart and his wife remained at Abingdon for the first years of their marriage. The Stuart family and the Washingtons remained very close. In 1785, Dr. Stuart purchased an estate, Hope Park, in Fairfax County, Virginia and moved the family there. The girls continued to visit back and forth with their grandparents, and Martha Washington‚Äôs letters mark these occasions. Elizabeth and Martha are taken often to Mount Vernon in George Washington‚Äôs coach. When Eleanor Calvert Custis Stuart went to stay with her mother on her father‚Äôs death in 1788, the two sisters remained with Martha Washington.

Speculation proved volatile, but he became known as one of the city's wealthiest citizens. He was not always successful in his affairs and eventually lost much of his fortune before his death. The announcement of Elizabeth's engagement came as a surprise to George and Martha Washington, as Thomas was twice Elizabeth's age.

Martha Washington bequeathed her younger sister, Delphy, to the bride and groom instead. In 1800 Delphy married William Costin, a free man, and lived with him in Washington, DC.

Eliza remained in close contact with William and Delphy Costin throughout her life. Upon her marriage, Elizabeth Law had inherited about 80 slaves from her late father's estate. After Martha Washington died in 1802, she inherited about 35 dower slaves from her grandfather Daniel Parke Custis's estate. Martha Washington had use of them in her lifetime. Following Elizabeth Law's mother's 1811 death, her father's estate was liquidated, and she inherited about 40 more slaves.Henry Weincek, An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2003), p. 383n. She likely sold some of them for her support. In March, 1796, Elizabeth and Thomas moved into the Thomas Law House near present-day 6th and N Streets Southwest. The house became known as \\"Honeymoon House\\" as the Laws lived there for a few months while awaiting completion of their house. They moved at the end of August. The National Park Service listed the house on the National Register of Historic Places on August 14, 1973. Following her separation from Thomas, Elizabeth resided between 1805 and 1809 at a \\"small country house\\" and estate on Seminary Hill in Alexandria, which she called Mount Washington. Mount Washington later was acquired by the Episcopal High School and used as its central administration building; it was known as Hoxton House. Martha Washington bequeathed to Elizabeth the John Trumbull portrait of General Washington, Washington at Verplanck's Point, as well as a dressing table and looking glass. Death and interment Elizabeth Parke Custis Law died in Richmond, Virginia at the home of a friend \\"on Saturday night (that is, 31 December 1831), ten minutes before 12 o'clock,\\" according to her obituary in the Richmond Enquirer. (Her death date is sometimes given as 1 January 1832.) Her body was interred in the New Tomb at Mount Vernon on 7 January 1832. Settlement and estate Law made a marriage settlement with his wife at the time of their separation, providing for an annuity from certain real estate property. Her son-in-law Nicholas L. Rogers gained appointment as administrator of her estate in December 1832, on behalf of her three grandchildren (his children).Adams v. Law, 58 U.S. 417 (1854), Justia - US Supreme Court cases; accessed 5 February 2018 He filed suit against the administrator of her marriage settlement for payment of annuities and interest that were outstanding. After Thomas Law's death in 1834, these issues became tied to settlement of his estate, which was contested for decades. He had made specific bequests for two grandchildren by his late natural son John, as well as for another natural son. He also had made bequests for his three legitimate grandchildren. The case was finally settled in 1854 by a US Supreme Court decision (Adams v. Law), by which time his remaining property was said to have greatly increased in value. NotesReferences * John T.

The Old Grodno Castle (also known as the Grodno Upper Castle and Bathory's Castle) originated in the 11th century as the seat of a dynasty of Black Ruthenian rulers, descended from a younger son of Yaroslav the Wise of Kiev. The 13th-century keep of the castle belonged to a type of Belarusian defensive tower represented by the Tower of Kamyanyets. Vytautas the Great added five Brick Gothic towers in 1391‚Äì98, transforming the castle into one of his main residences. Casimir IV Jagiellon also favoured Grodno over Lithuania's official capital. It was there that the Polish Crown was offered to him, and it was there that he died in 1492. The next notable tenant of the castle was Stephen B√°thory who envisaged Grodno as the capital of his vast empire in Eastern Europe. He engaged Scotto of Parma to replace the Vytautas Castle with his own residence in the advanced Renaissance taste of Northern Italy. After Bathory's death in Grodno in 1586, his pet project was abandoned. The citadel was devastated by the Russians during a Russo- Polish War in 1655. The castle's revival was owing to Krzysztof Zygmunt Pac who raised sufficient funds to finance the refurbishing of the royal residence. The restored castle was selected by King Micha≈Ç Korybut Wi≈õniowiecki of Poland as the location for every third Sejm of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. The castle suffered extensive damage during the Great Northern War, forcing the royal court to move into the New Grodno Castle.

Biography Leul Gugsa Araya Selassie was the legitimate son of Ras Araya Selassie Yohannes. Araya Selassie Yohannes was the legitimate son of Emperor Yohannes IV of Ethiopia. In 1917, Gugsa Araya Selassie married Leult Yeshashework Yilma, the niece of Ras Tafari Makonnen. On 2 November 1930, Tafari Makonnen was crowned as Emperor Haile Selassie. Gugsa Araya Selassie had a son Kifletsion Gugsa by his second wife Woizero Zimam Birru, daughter of Degiat Birru. After Ras Gugsa died woizero Zimam Birru Married to Degiat Zegeye Hailu. On 11 January 1921, Gugsa Araya Selassie captured Lij Iyasu. Iyasu was then delivered by him into the custody of Ras Kassa Haile Darge. While sometimes referred to as \\"Emperor Iyasu V,\\" Iyasu was never formally crowned Emperor of Ethiopia. In 1916, Iyasu was deposed after forces loyal to him were defeated in the Battle of Segale. Iyasu was replaced by his aunt, Empress Zewditu I. 40-year-old Zewditu named as her Enderase, or Regent, the then 24-year-old Ras Tafari Makonnen. Iyasu and a small band of followers roamed the Afar Depression for five years after his being deposed before falling into the hands of Gugsa Araya Selassie. Gugsa Araya Selassie was a Ras and Shum of eastern Tigray Province. Towards the end of 1928, Negus Tafari called for Ras Gugsa Araya Selassie and the governors of several other provinces to suppress an Oromo revolt in Wollo. Like many of those approached by Tafari, his response was not enthusiastic. Being a traditionalist, Gugsa Araya Selassie was not happy about the rise of Tafari. He was approached by Ras Gugsa Welle concerning an uprising against Tafari. But, after initially indicating support, he did not respond to a letter from Gugsa Welle.Marcus, A History of Ethiopia, p. 128 When Gugsa Welle openly revolted, Gugsa Araya Selassie did not support him. By 1932, Gugsa Araya Selassie's health deteriorated and he fell ill. Haile Selassie authorized a trip to Switzerland for medical help. Had Gugsa Araya Selassie traveled in a stretcher, he may have made it. But tradition dictated that a Ras travel by war mule and this is what he did. He averaged about one hour of travel per day. His doctor insisted that he should stop traveling in this manner, but tradition won out and he died.Mockler, Haile Sellassie's War, p. 30 On 28 April 1932, according to legend, the corpse of Ras Gugsa Araya Selassie entered Adigrat strapped upright on his war mule. Upon his death, his son, Haile Selassie Gugsa, moved into his father's Italian-built palace in Mek'ele and replaced him as Shum of eastern Tigray.

She has released three CD singles since 2007 and has taken part in the Swedish song selection process for the Eurovision Song Contest, Melodifestivalen, twice, in 2007 and more recently in 2009. Early life Sofia was born in Stockholm, Sweden in 1979. Up until she was about sixteen, she visited Greece every summer on vacation and toured the country while being based mainly in Athens. She stated that she fell in love with the country and its music and culture after becoming friends with Greek musician Alexandros Papakonstantinou. Musical career2007-2008: \\"Hypnotized\\" and \\"Pote\\"= In 2007, Sofia participated in Melodifestivalen, the Swedish song selection process for the Eurovision Song Contest. She appeared in the first semi-final on February 3, 2007 and performed the song \\"Hypnotized\\" seventh in the running order. The song was described as having a Greek flavor and overall her performance was seen as professional, with her singing with a \\"very strong voice\\". The song did not manage to make it to the next round, placing seventh. Sofia stated in an interview after the event that she was very satisfied with her performance and that she never thought that she would be able to go through to the final. She added that she was \\"happy that [she] got a chance to show the Swedish audience who [she was] and what [she] can deliver on stage\\". Following her appearance in Melodifestivalen, she released \\"Hypnotized\\" digitally as a four track CD single on February 5, 2007, with a physical copy being released on February 10. In addition to the original version, it contained a remix by Oscar Holter, a karaoke version, and a version sung in Greek titled \\"Ipopta Vlemata\\" (Suspicious). The song charted in Sweden for two weeks, peaking at number 50, and in Finland where it charted for a week, peaking at number six. After Melodifestivalen, Sofia traveled to Greece where she stayed for eleven months. At the beginning of November 2007, Sofia attended and performed at the Thessaloniki Song Festival with the song \\"Anikse Tin Porta\\" (Open the door) once again composed by Dimitris Stassos and sung in Greek. In Fall 2008, Sofia made her Greek market debut, releasing a two track CD single titled \\"Pote\\" (Never). \\"Pote\\" is a pop ballad written by Greek- Swedes Nektarios Tyrakis, Dimitris Stassos and Irini Michas; Stassos had previously written \\"Hypnotized\\". In addition to the title track, the song \\"Toso Apla\\" (That simple) was also included, which is a duet between Sofia and Greek rap group Goin' Through. =2009-present: \\"Alla\\"= In early 2009, Sofia released \\"Pote\\" in Sweden as a two track CD single, switching the duet with a remix of \\"Pote\\". In February, she once again took part in Melodifestivalen, this time with the song \\"Alla\\" (Other), sung in Greek. In an interview, Sofia said that she wanted to perform the song in Greek because she likes the language and because it was originally written in Greek and therefore should be performed that way. It was written by Dimitris Stassos, Nina Karolidou, Irini Michas, and Henrik Wikstr√∂m who described it as \\"a rock inspired ethno pop number, or pop/rock [song] with a cool riff\\". Sofia performed the song seventh on the night in the third semi-final of Melodifestivalen 2009, held on February 21, 2009. She was not one of the four songs selected for the final or second chance rounds, placing seventh of eight, but was chosen by the international jury to go against the other jury choices from the other semi- finals, with a chance of being the eleventh song in the contest's final. A little more than a week later, \\"Alla\\" was released as a two track CD single on March 1, 2009 along with many of the other songs in the contest; it features the radio mix and a remix of the song by Oscar Holter. On March 7, Sofia once again appeared at Melodifestivalen, though she did not perform. Following the end of the \\"Second Chance Round\\", the jury chose her over Amy Diamond to go to the final, held on March 14, 2009. In an interview after the round, Sofia said that she was glad that she would have the chance to sing the song even better than before and that she was probably chosen because she is an international artist with an international song. At the Melodifestivalen final, Sofia presented \\"Alla\\" ninth out of the eleven participants. When the results were announced, she received twelve points in total, eight from the international jury and four from the regional juries, placing her tenth. Soon after the final, the song entered the Swedish Singles Chart and peaked at number 24. In early 2011, Sofia resurfaced in music after a press release by Oxygen Music/4 Music stated that she and writer/rapper Apollon were submitted to Greek broadcaster Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation to be considered as participants together in a national final to represent Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011. The record label alleged that the broadcaster would not entertain the idea of either the label or Sofia and Apollon participating in the final. The claim was similar to several other acts who wished to participate, but were blocked from consideration by the broadcaster.

It contained the single \\"Polk Salad Annie\\" which was a staple of Elvis Presley's live sets in the 1970s. It was recorded at RCA Victor Studios, Nashville and produced by Billy Swan. \\"Polk Salad Annie\\"'s lyrics describe the lifestyle of a generic poor Southern girl. Traditionally, the term to describe the type of food highlighted in the song is \\"poke salad.\\" Its 1968 single release peaked at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100. The single, released by Monument Records, had been out nine months before it finally charted, and had been written off by Monument as a failure. Said White: \\"They had done given up on it, but we kept getting all these people in Texas coming to the clubs and buying the record. So we would send up to Nashville saying, 'Send us a thousand more this week.' They would send us these 'Do Not Sell' examples, so we would have to sit down and mark out the 'Do Not Sell' and then send them to the record stores. All these stores in South Texas kept calling our house saying, 'We need more.' So we just kept hanging on. And finally a guy in L.A. picked it up and got it across. Otherwise, 'Polk' could have been lost forever.\\" The song vividly recreates the Southern roots of White's childhood and his music reflects this earthy rural background. As a child he listened not only to local bluesmen and countrysingers but also to the Cajun music of Louisiana, that rare hybrid of traditional musical styles introduced by French settlers at the turn of the century. His roots lie in the swamplands of Oak Grove, Louisiana, where he was born in 1943. Situated just west of the Mississippi River, it's a land of cottonfields, where polk salad grows wild and alligators lurk in moss-covered swamps. \\"I spent the first 18 years of my life down there,\\" said White \\"My folks raised cotton and corn. There were lotsa times when there weren't too much to eat, and I ain't ashamed to admit that we've often whipped up a mess of polk salad.

History  James Cohan Gallery opened in New York City in September 1999 with an inaugural exhibition of early photo-pieces by Gilbert & George and has continued an on-going exhibition program that includes the work of both established and emerging artists. The gallery maintains a strong international focus representing a diverse selection of contemporary artists from Ethiopia, China, Vietnam, Japan, Costa Rica, The Dominican Republic, the U.K. as well as the United States. The gallery also represents the estate of pioneering artist Robert Smithson as well as the influential Californian painter Lee Mullican. Other notable artists represented by the gallery include seminal video artist Bill Viola and highly influential land artist Richard Long. The gallery has experienced significant recent growth and development, adding a number of new artists to its roster. In 2017 the gallery announced the representation of Kathy Butterly and Grace Weaver who both had solo shows with the gallery in September 2018, in the Chelsea and Chinatown locations respectively. Further additions to the gallery's roster were made in 2018 with the gallery announcing the representation of artists Josiah McElheny and Matthew Ritchie as well as the most recent addition of Firelei B√°ez. In October 2018 the gallery made the announcement that it will be moving its primary space in Chelsea to the neighborhood of Tribeca, where it will take up residence at 48 Walker Street in September 2019. The gallery is to be opened with a solo show by the artist Josiah McElheny. James Cohan, the gallery's owner has said of the move, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a certain migration out of Chelsea heading into TriBeCa. For me, it‚Äôs very simple, in that I feel like I‚Äôd rather work for my artists than for my landlord.‚Äù Controversy A coalition of Asian American groups entered and protested Omer Fast's 2017 exhibit in the gallery's Lower East Side location that attempted to reproduce stereotypical Chinatown aesthetics. Fast's exhibition, August, constructed a caricature of a derelict Chinatown business that visitors walk through to see the artist's video work in the backroom. Protesters outside held a large yellow banner that said ‚ÄúRacism Disguised as Art‚Äù in three languages (English, Chinese, and Spanish). In response to these allegations, the gallery issued the following statement; We support the right of free speech by the protesters to Omer Fast's exhibition at the gallery.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on March 26, 2009. In this episode, Michael, who has given his two weeks' notice to Dunder Mifflin, tries to convince others in the office to quit and join him in starting a new paper company. Meanwhile, Pam spends her day trying to put together the new photocopier and becomes frustrated with her job. The episode was written by Aaron Shure and directed by Paul Lieberstein. Executive story editor Charlie Grandy conceived the idea of Michael leaving Dunder Mifflin, and the writers collectively decided the Pam character should leave and try to find out what she wants from life. The episode included a guest appearance by Idris Elba, who played new Dunder Mifflin vice president Charles Miner. \\"Two Weeks\\" received generally positive reviews and, according to Nielsen ratings, was watched by 8.7 million overall viewers and was the top-rated show on NBC the week it aired. \\"Two Weeks\\" received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Single- Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series. Synopsis Having submitted his two weeks' notice to Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) begins goofing off and drinking around the office, while new company vice president Charles Miner (Idris Elba) plans to hire the new regional manager from the outside, for \\"obvious reasons.\\" The employees suggest that Michael start looking for another job. Michael is unworried at first, until he learns how poorly the economy is performing. He first tries Prince Paper, but they had been run out of business by Dunder Mifflin. After finding no available work, Michael decides to start his own paper company and unsuccessfully tries to convince others around the office to join him. When Charles catches Michael labeling Dunder Mifflin customer lists with his new company's name, he orders security guard Hank (Hugh Dane) to escort Michael from the building. Michael drives out of the parking lot, but is later spotted sneaking back into the building. The office has received a new copy machine, but it is not assembled, so Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) spends the day putting it together as the rest of the employees hassle and tease her. She finally completes assembling it, but feels no satisfaction about it afterward, and comes to realize how underutilized and underappreciated she is at her job. Meanwhile, Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) and Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) continue to flirt with Charles. Michael sneaks back into the office, crawling on the floor below the desks so Charles, who is sitting in the conference room, will not notice him. Michael grabs his customer list and makes a final desperate offer for the other employees to join him. Charles notices Michael and physically threatens him, prompting Michael to leave without the customer list. After Charles angrily closes the conference room door, Pam follows Michael out of the building, announcing that she is leaving with him. However, she tells Michael she wants to be a salesperson at his new company, not a receptionist. Michael agrees, then asks Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he wants to come with them, but he declines. Pam and Michael leave together, feeling both exhilarated and apprehensive. At the end of the episode, Charles, who still knows very little about the employees at the Scranton branch, decides to make Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) the temporary receptionist and make Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) the office's \\"Productivity Czar,\\" much to the surprise of both men. Production The Office actor and producer Paul Lieberstein directed \\"Two Weeks\\". \\"Two Weeks\\" was written by Aaron Shure and directed by Paul Lieberstein. Executive story editor Charlie Grandy conceived the idea of Michael leaving Dunder Mifflin. Shure said there was a great deal of debate among the writers about Pam's decision to leave Dunder Mifflin with Michael, but they decided to move in that direction to demonstrate Pam was trying to figure out what she wants in life. Lieberstein thought of the idea of the final scene in which Michael and Pam's faces go from optimism to concern, because he felt it would anchor the episode. The decision to have Charles choose Stanley as productivity czar and Kevin as receptionist was made by Shure the day before the episode's draft was handed in because he wanted to have Charles make \\"rookie mistakes, despite all his poise.\\" \\"Two Weeks\\" was the second of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba, best known as Stringer Bell from The Wire. Elba said he did not watch the episode after it aired because \\"I'm hypercritical about my work, so I try not to torture myself.\\" The official The Office website included three cut scenes from \\"Two Weeks\\" within a week of the episode's original release. In one minute-long clip, Michael asks Darryl for warehousing advice for his new paper company; Darryl gives Michael encouraging words about the new business venture before admitting, \\"I'm messing with you. This doesn't sound like a good idea.\\" In a second one- minute clip, Michael tries stealing office supplies from the Dunder Mifflin office for his new company, until he is caught by Charles, who literally chases him out of the office; Charles then tries to describe what Michael's like to the camera but finds himself shocked into silence. In a final 38-second clip, Kelly visits Michael's office to ask what he will do with his life, then starts talking about her own fantasy of running off to Mexico with Charles. B. J. Novak wrote a talking-head segment for Toby, where he compares Michael to a movie on a plane because \\"it's not great, but it's something to watch, and when it's over you're like, how much longer is this flight? Now what?\\" An original draft for the episode included more dialogue between Pam and Jim about the decision, in which Pam brought up Jim's impulsive decision to buy his parents' house without consulting her in the episode \\"Frame Toby,\\" but it was ultimately cut because they felt it added too much time to get to the resolution. A number of documentary-style interviews with Dwight about Michael's defection and his thoughts about Charles Miner were cut for length issues. Immediately after \\"Two Weeks\\" was first broadcast, NBC Universal's The Office website DunderMifflinInfinity.com sent mass e-mail messages said to be from \\"Michael Gary Scott\\" encouraging people to join his new company, \\"The Michael Scott Paper Company.\\" The message, which included a link to the website, said \\"As the manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton I learned two things: everything about the paper business and that Dunder Mifflin is a suckee company. I‚Äôm taking that expertness and creating The Michael Scott Paper Company. ‚Ä¶ I cannot promise success, but I will promise you the best effing time of your life!!!\\" Cultural references Michael accidentally visits a website about actual monsters when trying to visit Monster.com, a popular employment site. During work, Michael drinks a combination of scotch and Splenda, an artificial sweetener; Michael had the same drink in the third season episode \\"Cocktails\\". Michael tries to get a job with Prince Family Paper Company only to find they have gone out of business; this is a reference to \\"Prince Family Paper\\", an episode from earlier in the fifth season, in which Michael and Dwight go undercover at Prince Paper to learn their company secrets and steal their clients. While flirting with Charles, Kelly said her family was so close they were like the Kardashians, a reference to the E! reality series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Several reviewers compared Pam's decision to quit with Michael to that of Ren√©e Zellweger's character in the 1996 film Jerry Maguire, and the final scene in which Michael and Pam go from excitement over their new company to concern about the future to the final moments of The Graduate. Shure, who said he is a fan of the movie scene, said it was not directly inspired by the film, but he was \\"painfully aware of the inevitable comparison\\"; he said the writers considered having Michael refer to the movie in the episode, but dropped it due to time constraints. The line spoken by Oscar, \\"Just like that, as mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone\\" was written by Office writer Mindy Kaling and was inspired by the Keyser S√∂ze character in the 1995 film, The Usual Suspects. Reception In its original American broadcast on March 26, 2009, \\"Two Weeks\\" was watched by 8.7 million overall viewers, and 5.8 million viewers among ages 18 to 49. The episode had a 4.5 rating and 11 share in the 18 to 49 demographic, making it NBC's top-rated show the week it aired. \\"Two Weeks\\" received generally positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger praised the episode and specific elements of it, like Michael wandering around the office drunk and many of the documentary-style interviews, like Charles talking about his effect on women, Toby comparing Michael to a movie on a plane and Kevin being too lazy to compliment Michael in person. But he said the episode was \\"elevated\\" by Michael and Pam forming a partnership at the end: \\"Steve Carell and Jenna Fischer are always brilliant in those moments when they have to show multiple emotions at once, so it was nice to finally see them get to do it side-by-side.\\" Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons said \\"Two Weeks\\" offered a change that would keep the series fresh and, although she said it was \\"not a nonstop laugh riot\\", she said it \\"highlights what The Office does that few other shows ever even attempt: incredibly humane, subtle moments that contrast with the kind of chaos only ever borne of monotony.\\" Brian Howard of The Journal News said the episode flowed well and he liked the payoff at the end when Pam joined Michael's new paper company, but he said the moments with Michael crawling on the floor felt like \\"unnecessary padding\\". Nevertheless, he said, \\"I'm looking forward to rewatching this episode, probably the first time I've done that since 'Lecture Circuit: Part I. Andy Shaw of TV Fodder said Michael was much more likable in \\"Two Weeks\\" than in other recent episodes, and said, \\"Steve Carell was at his best, with great throwaway lines and getting to the heart of Michael's love for Dunder-Mifflin and paper.\\" Will Leitch of New York magazine said the episode marked a \\"major step\\" for the series and had some particularly sweet moments between Michael and Pam. He also particularly liked the moment when Charles Miner, who is played by the same actor who played drug dealer Stringer Bell on the HBO series The Wire, threatened to attack Michael: \\"Michael Scott being beaten up by Stringer Bell. That's one for the TV annals.\\" Rick Porter of Zap2it said the episode was \\"pretty good\\" and that Jenna Fischer was \\"fantastic\\", but he felt the episode was less outright funny than recent episodes. But Porter also said he had mixed feelings about Pam's decision to work for Michael and about the Charles Miner character, who he said might be too humorless and uncomfortable for the show. Travis Fickett of IGN felt it was disappointing and slow-paced compared to last week's episode \\"New Boss\\": \\"Things slow down a bit as we sort of repeat the awkwardness between Michael and new regional manager Charles Miner. It feels a bit like the episode is marking time ‚Äì which is exactly what Michael is doing with his final two weeks on the job.\\" \\"Two Weeks\\" was voted the eighteenth highest-rated episode out of 26 from the fifth season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally; the episode was rated 7.74 out of 10. Stuart Bass received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series. \\"Two Weeks\\" accounted for one of the ten Primetime Emmy Award nominations The Office received for the show's fifth season at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards, which were held on September 20, 2009.

The harvested coffee seeds are exposed to the monsoon rain and winds for a period of about three to four months, causing the beans to swell and lose the original acidity, resulting in a flavor profile with a practically neutral pH balance. The coffee is unique to the Malabar Coast of Karnataka and Kerala and has protected status under India's Geographical Indications of Goods Act. The name Monsoon Malabar is derived from exposure to the monsoon winds of the Malabar coast. The blend is heavy bodied, pungent, and considered to be dry with a musty, chocolatey aroma and notes of spice and nuts.  History  The origins of Monsoon Malabar date back to the times of the British Raj, when, during the months that the beans were transported by sea from India to Europe, the humidity and the sea winds combined to cause the coffee to ripen from the fresh green to a more aged pale yellow. In the past, when wooden vessels carried raw coffee from India to Europe, during the monsoon months taking almost six months to sail around the Cape of Good Hope, the coffee beans, exposed to constant humid conditions, underwent characteristic changes. The beans changed in size, texture, and appearance, both as beans and in the cup. Modern transportation reduced the length of this journey and better protected the beans from weathering and humidity. However, the coffee beans now arriving in European ports lacked the depth and character of the coffee beans previously received. In the past, the coffee beans had been changed by exposure to the sea air and monsoon winds and rain. An alternative process was implemented to replicate these conditions. A typical ambiance could be simulated along the coastal belt of southwest India during the monsoon months, bringing about the same characteristic change to the ordinary cherry coffee beans. Varietals Different varietals of the coffee bean may be processed in this way, hence monsoon malabar arabica and monsoon malabar robusta.  Monsooning process  Whole crops of cherry coffee are selected and sun-dried in expansive barbecues. The dried beans are cured and sorted into 'AA' and 'A' grades, after which they are stored in warehouses until the onset of monsoon. From June through September, the selected beans are exposed to moisture-laden monsoon winds in well-ventilated warehouses (12 to 16 weeks time). The monsooning process involves careful handling, repeated spreading, raking and turning around in regular intervals. The beans absorb moisture and get significantly larger, turning a pale golden colour. Further micro-sorting is done to separate fully monsooned beans.

New Grodno Castle is above sea level.New Grodno Castle Altitude and Position The royal residence was built on the high bank of the Neman River at a little distance from the Old Grodno Castle which had suffered great dilapidation in the aftermath of the Swedish occupation in the early 18th century. The two castles are joined by a 300-year-old arch bridge. The palace compound was designed by Carl Frederick P√∂ppelmann. Construction was carried out between 1734 and 1751 under the supervision of several other Saxon architects, including Johann Friedrich Kn√∂bel and Joachim Daniel von Jauch. The palace was completed under the direction of Giuseppe de Sacco in 1789 and remained home for King Stanis≈Çaw II August until 1797. Used as a hospital and barracks throughout most of the 19th century, the palace was renovated by the Polish administration in the interwar period. Scarcely anything is left of the original fabric of the castle, whose refined Rococo detailing vanished during World War II. There followed a hasty and rather superficial refurbishing of the palace by the Soviets with a view to making it the headquarters of a local obkom. A plaque on the wall of the palace commemorates the council of war held in the royal residence by Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko on 30 October 1794.

Its last assignment was with 32nd Air Operations Group, based at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. It was inactivated on 1 November 2005. Between 1955 and 1994, the unit was based at Soesterberg Air Base in the Netherlands, providing air defence on behalf of NATO as a fighter squadron. HistoryWorld War II= 32nd Pursuit Squadron P-36 Hawks at Ponce Field, Puerto Rico, 1941 The US Army Air Corps constituted the 32nd Pursuit Squadron (Interceptor). Seven weeks later, on 1 February 1940, the squadron activated at Kelly Field, Texas. After completing this training, in November 1940, the 32nd transferred to Langley Field in Virginia to join the 36th Pursuit Group. Once there, the 36th equipped the squadron with Curtiss P-36A Hawk aircraft. During its stay at Langley, the 32nd Pursuit Squadron flew a number of Curtiss YP-37 aircraft for a short period. Panama Canal Defense 32nd Fighter Squadron P-39 with squadron emblem, Hato Field, Cura√ßao, March 1944 On 6 January 1941, the squadron moved to Losey Field, on the island of Puerto Rico as a reaction to the German presence in South America. By June the Squadron had a mix of Curtiss P-40 Warhawks and Bell P-39 Airacobras at Ponce Field, although several Curtiss P-36As had been briefly assigned earlier during its first days on Puerto Rico. This strength remained essentially unchanged up to 7 December 1941. After the Pearl Harbor Attack, the Squadron dispatched a detachment to Arecibo Field, Puerto Rico. In early 1942, the German Navy began anti-shipping operations using U-Boats in the Caribbean. The subs sank several tankers in the harbor at San Nicholas, Aruba and even shelled an oil refinery on the island. The Squadron standardized on the P-39, and established detachments at Arecibo Field and Bourne Field, Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. The Squadron moved entirely to Arecibo by 19 February. Another detachment was established at Hato Field, Cura√ßao. The mission was to provide air defense for the bomber and anti-submarine units that had been assembled there. The Puerto Rico-based elements of the Squadron went through a training program, which included maneuvers with Puerto Rican Infantry and Artillery units. Redesignated as the 32nd Fighter Squadron on 15 May 1942, by the end of June the main body was still at Arecibo, although the detachments at St. Thomas and Hato Field continued. The 32nd Fighter Squadron had the responsibility for tracking down German U-Boat Wolfpacks. The Wolfpacks, three or more subs together in a mission known as search and destroy, this led to the famous name and insignia \\"Wolfhounds\\". In the fall of 1942, the Germans reduced their submarine activity in the Caribbean region to concentrate its activity on the North Atlantic convoy route and the approaches to northwest Africa. With the withdrawal of submarines from the Caribbean region the Antilles Air Task Force, which included the 32nd, concentrated its efforts as a striking force on its primary function of guarding against possible attacks on the Panama Canal. With the departure of its parent 36th Fighter Group to the United States in June 1943, the 32nd remained in the Caribbean. On 3 August 1943, the squadron was transferred to the Antilles Air Command. The Squadron was further assigned to the Trinidad Detachment and VI Fighter Command, Antilles Air Command. However, despite the assignment to Antilles Air Command, a detachment of the Squadron was noted at Howard Field in the Panama Canal Zone detached to XXVI Fighter Command. Effective 13 March 1944, the entire Squadron moved to France Field in the Panama Canal Zone to replace the 52d Fighter Squadron. The squadron was placed under XXVI Fighter Command, whose task was to defend the Panama Canal and to perform reconnaissance missions. The unit moved from France Field to Howard Field between 7 and 10 January 1945, where it was to replace the 43d Fighter Squadron and prepare for the transition to Lockheed P-38 Lightnings. On 1 February 1945, the unit was redesignated as the 32nd Fighter Squadron, Twin Engine. However, no sooner had conversion to the P-38's been completed than the entire complement of P-38s was hangared and the unit activities ran down with the end of the war in Europe. The squadron ceased all flying activities in June, and the P-38s were stored in a hangar. By October 1945, the squadron was reduced to a non-operational administrative organization. Inactivated on 15 October 1946. =Air defense in the Netherlands (1955‚Äì1994)= North American F-100C Super Sabres in flight, 1959. In 1954, the Netherlands government agreed, at the instigation of NATO, to accept the offer of the American government to deploy a squadron of American military planes. The task of the squadron would be to provide a contribution to Dutch air defense, within the context of NATO. The 512th Fighter Day Squadron, stationed at RAF Manston in Great Britain, was detailed by the Headquarters of the USAFE for transference to the Netherlands. Its new home base would be Soesterberg Air Base. The first group of American airmen, compromised quartermasters and air traffic controllers, arrived at Soesterberg on 6 October 1954. In September 1955, the 512th moved to RAF Bentwaters, England without personnel or equipment. Its 28 North American F-86F Sabres, personnel and equipment however stayed in the Netherlands and were assigned to the newly activated 32nd Fighter-Day Squadron (32nd FDS). The squadron designation was chosen by the USAF in light of the World War II ties by the squadron to the defense of Dutch possessions in the Caribbean, giving the unit a historical link to the Netherlands. The 32nd was assigned to the 36th Fighter-Day Wing at Bitburg Air Base in West Germany, its historical parent unit at the time of its activation. On 15 August 1956, the 32nd FDS began to receive the North American F-100C Super Sabre. Convair F-102A Delta Daggers of the 32nd FIS in formation, circa 1960s. On 18 July 1958, the USAFE redesignated the unit as the 32nd Tactical Fighter Squadron (32nd TFS), as part of the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing as a result of an Air Force‚Äìwide redesignation of tactical air units. In 1959, the 32nd received the signature \\"Royal\\", the crown and wreath of the Dutch Royal Family (the House of Orange) were added to the emblem, giving it its unique look. This unique honor was granted in recognition of the unit's contribution to the defense of The Netherlands and graphically illustrates the 32nd's close ties with the Royal Netherlands Air Force. This designation was brief, however, and the squadron became the 32nd Fighter- Interceptor Squadron (32nd FIS) a year later. On 17 December 1960, the Wolfhounds received their first eight Convair F-102A Delta Daggers. On 1 November 1968, the USAF transferred the 32nd Fighter Interceptor Squadron to the command of Seventeenth Air Force stationed at Sembach Air Base, Germany. Tactical fighter operations (1969‚Äì1989) McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom IIs of the 32nd TFS taking off from Soesterberg Air Base, 1976. On 1 July 1969, the USAF redesignated the unit as the 32nd Tactical Fighter Squadron (32nd TFS) and reequipped the squadron with the McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom II, with the first two (68-0401 and 68-0405) arriving on 6 August 1969. On 14 November 1969, the 32nd TFS lost their first Phantom when F-4E 68-0422 crashed on approach to Aviano Air Base, Italy, after running out of fuel - both crew ejected safely. On 21 June 1971, F-4E 68-0433 crashed near Maurik, the Netherlands, killing both the crew after the pilot over corrected when trying to avoid a flock of birds. In March 1976, the Wolfhounds began receiving newer FY1974 F-4Es to replace their older models. On 22 August 1977, F-4E Phantom II 74-1051 crashed into the North Sea near Terschelling after suffering an engine flame out, killing both crew members. On 19 October 1977, the USAF decided that the 32nd would receive the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle as part of Project Ready Eagle. Throughout 1978, the majority of Phantoms were flown to Ramstein Air Base in West Germany where they were assigned to the 86th Tactical Fighter Wing, while others went to Spangdahlem Air Base and Hahn Air Base. While the Wolfhounds underwent conversion from the Phantom, the 71st Tactical Fighter Squadron and 94th Tactical Fighter Squadron deployed to Soesterberg from 13 September to 20 December 1978 as part of Coronet Sandpiper to fulfil NATO's air defence commitment. The first two F-15As (77-0074 and 77-0075) for the 32nd TFS arrived at Soesterberg on 13 September 1978, with the last jets arriving on 17 January 1979. The 32nd TFS began receiving the more advanced F-15C in June 1980. McDonnell Douglas F-15C Eagle 79-0032 of the 32nd TFS taxiing at Soesterberg, May 1986. Between 7 and 23 June 1982, the Wolfhounds hosted the 71st TFS who had deployed to Soesterberg as part of Coronet Sidewinder II. The 32nd TFS hosted the 71st TFS once more between 1 and 29 June 1984 as part of Coronet Hawk. The 9th Tactical Fighter Squadron deployed to Soesterberg between 20 May and 20 June 1986 under Coronet Apache. On 4 July 1989, a pair of 32nd TFS F-15Cs scrambled to intercept what turned out to be an unoccupied Soviet Air Forces MiG-23M 'Flogger' which had flown on autopilot from its base in Bagicz, Poland, to West Germany after the pilot had ejected. The pilots were instructed to shoot it down over the North Sea however the MiG-23 ran out of fuel and crashed into a house in Kortrijk, Belgium, killing an occupant. In 1989, the Dutch government allowed USAF to expand its headquarters unit at Soesterberg from squadron to group. The 32nd Tactical Fighter Group was activated at Soesterberg on 16 November 1989 and took over functions of old 32nd Squadron headquarters element and support flights (later squadrons) received support responsibilities. On 25 April 1990, F-15C 81-0049 crashed into the North Sea after its engines caught fire ‚Äì the pilot ejected safely. The 32nd TFS hosted the 60th Tactical Fighter Squadron between 31 May and 25 June 1990 as part of Coronet Trigger. Gulf War to inactivation (1990‚Äì1994) McDonnell Douglas F-15A Eagle 77-0100 of the 32nd FS at RAF Lakenheath, August 1992. During the 1991 Gulf War, after more than forty years, the Wolfhounds saw action again. Aircrew and ground support personnel were deployed, during the Operations DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM, August 1990 until March 1991, at Incirlik Air Base, Turkey. On 28 January 1991, Capt. \\"Muddy\\" Watrous shot down an Iraqi Air Force MiG-23 'Flogger', the Wolfhounds only victory of the war. After the war, they continued their air activities in theatre as a part of Operation Provide Comfort from April 1991 until April 1993. Headquarters USAFE replaced the 32nd Fighter Group on 1 July with the 632nd Air Base Squadron; its duty was to complete the closure actions. In late 1991 and throughout 1992, the Wolfhounds began re-equipping with the F-15A/B. On 1 November 1991, the unit was redesignated the 32nd Fighter Squadron (32nd FS). Between 9 June and 1 July 1992, the 60th Fighter Squadron deployed to Soesterberg as part of Coronet Volunteer. On 19 April 1994, the group furled its colors in formal ceremonies attended by members of the Royal family and the American ambassador. The 32nd Group's subordinate units were inactivated on 1 July and the group on 1 October 1994. =Air operations unit (1994‚Äì2005)= In the spring of 1994, USAFE received permission from HQ USAF to use the 32nd designation for the new 32nd Air Operations Group. The 32nd Fighter Squadron was redesigned the 32nd Air Operations Squadron on 1 August 1994 following their inactivation at Soesterberg Air Base in July. The squadron assigned to the 32nd Air Operations Group, formerly the 32nd Fighter Group, which was also redesigned on 1 August 1994. Both the group and the squadron were stationed at Kapaun Air Station, Germany, under the USAFE Theater Air and Space-operations Center. The 32nd Air Operations Squadron was inactivated on 1 November 2005.

MECD is characterized by the formation of microcysts in the outermost layer of the cornea, known as the anterior corneal epithelium. The anterior corneal epithelium also becomes fragile. This usually affects both eyes rather than a single eye and worsens over time. There are two phenotypes, Meesmann corneal dystrophy 1 (MECD1) and Meesmann corneal dystrophy 2 (MECD2), which affect the genes KRT3 and KRT12, respectively. A heterozygous mutation in either of these genes will lead to a single phenotype. Many with Meesmann corneal dystrophy are asymptomatic or experience mild symptoms. Autosomal Dominant Inheritance Pattern It is named after the German ophthalmologist Alois Meesmann (1888-1969).A. Meesmann. Klinische und anatomische Untersuchungen √ºber eine bisher unbekannte, dominant vererbte Dystrophia epithelialis corneae. Bericht der Deutschen ophthalmologischen Gesellschaft, Heidelberg, 1938, 52: 154-158. It is often considered as the \\"Meesmann-Wilke syndrome\\", after the joint contribution of Meesmann and Wilke in 1939.A. Meesmann, F. Wilke.

Research was later contributed by Stocker and Holt in 1954 through 1955 who found a variant of Meesmann corneal dystrophy called \\"Stocker-Holt Dystrophy\\".  Clinical Features and Symptoms  * Anterior corneal intraepithelial microcysts * Corneal erosions * Photophobia * Lacrimation * Intermittent visual acuity loss (rarely seriously impaired) * Nonprogressive corneal dystrophy * Fine punctate corneal opacities * Episodic foreign body sensation * Increased tear production * Eye stinging * Blepharospasm Meesmann corneal dystrophy is a non- inflammatory condition that effects the restricted region of the cornea epithelium which is the outermost layer. Onset of symptoms begin during infancy or early childhood but may not become noticeable or problematic for many years. Diagnosis Patients with Meesmann corneal dystrophy may remain asymptomatic or experience mild symptoms. Symptoms of Meesmann corneal dystrophy often go unnoticed and is usually found and diagnosed during routine eye examinations. This slowly progressive disorder is characterized by microcysts that are filled with debris in the epithelium of the cornea detected and clinically diagnosed with slit-lamp biomicroscopy and retroillumination. Under electron microscopy, there are an abnormal aggregation of keratin filament bundles in the center of the cornea. It was found to not affect the corneal stromal layer or endothelial cell layer. Signs of this disease appear in the early first few years of life and begin as eye irritation. Under magnification, corneal changes consisting of punctate opacities in the epithelium are found. Occasionally, these are found in the Bowman membrane. Patients diagnosed with Meesmann corneal dystrophy are unable to tolerate the use of contact lenses which irritate the corneal epithelium. Light microscopy and electron microscopy found that the basement membrane is thickened with an intracytoplasmic substance. Under slit-lamp photography, the cornea was found to be uneven due to the damage and scarring from the thickening basement membrane and anterior stroma. The buildup of foreign materials may cause vision blurriness or cloudiness.  Treatment  Patients with Meesman corneal dystrophy will suffer from chronic eye dryness that can be treated with lubricating eye drops but most cases do not require further treatment. In severe cases, surgery may be required due to excessive corneal scarring such as superficial keratectomy (SK), phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK), lamellar keratoplasty, or penetrating keratoplasty. Patients may relapse in symptoms but surgery prolongs the reoccurrence and may also lessen severity. Currently there are researchers studying the use of allele-specific siRNA against mutants with single-nucleotide specificity as a potential method of treatment for MECD.  Genetics  It has been associated with genes KRT3 and KRT12 located on chromosome 12 and 17 respectively found through the use of Polymerase chain reaction or PCR. These two genes function for keratin production and code for the production of keratin K3 (type II) and K12 (type I). There are several methods to find errors or mutations in the KRT3 and KRT12 genes including deletion/duplication analysis, sequence analysis of the entire coding region, and targeted variant analysis. These methods includes molecular genetic tests which include Next-Generation (NGS)/Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) and bi-directional sanger sequence analysis. A heterozygous missense mutation of Leu132Pro in the KRT12 gene exhibits a more severe phenotype while a mutation of Arg135Thr, which is most commonly found, exhibits milder symptoms. The Leu132Pro mutation and the animo acid change of N133K occurs in the helix-initiation motif of the keratin and was found to cause significant structural changes to the KRT12 gene. This mutation also leads to the aggregation of keratine and alters the keratin configuration of the corneal epithelium. The mechanism by which this mutation in K12 causes the formation of microcysts remains poorly understood.

It is one of the most popular Chinese dramatic works of the period prior to the Japanese invasion of China in 1937. History The drama Thunderstorm was first published in the literary magazine, Literary Quarterly. Shortly after its publication, a production of the play was mounted in Jinan, and later, in 1935, in Shanghai and in Tokyo, both of which were well received. In 1936, Thunderstorm debuted in Nanjing, with Cao Yu himself acting in the lead role. Plot The subject matter of Thunderstorm is the disastrous effects of rigid traditionalism and hypocrisy on the wealthy, modern, somewhat Westernized Zhou family.Dan Yao, Jinhui Deng, Feng Wang (2012) Chinese Literature Page 217. \\"Upon graduation from university, Cao Yu finished his maiden work Thunderstorm and became famous overnight. Later he wrote Sunrise ... series of tragedies triggered by an incest incident in an upper class family. Zhou Puyuan, the master of ...\\" Specifically, the plot of Thunderstorm centers on the Zhou family's psychological and physical destruction as a result of incest and oppression, caused by its morally depraved and corrupt patriarch, Zhou Puyuan, a wealthy businessman. The following synopsis is based on the complete version of the play (the prologue and epilogue are usually omitted from performances): Prologue Two children stumble into the former Zhou mansion, now a hospital operated by Catholic nuns. The hospital is inhabited by two mentally disturbed patients, one a silent and morose old woman and another a younger, violently hysterical woman. An elderly man named \\"old Mr Zhou\\" visits them. Through the dialogue between the nurses, it is revealed that old Mr Zhou is the husband of the younger patient, that three people died in this house ten years before in a tragedy and as a result the house is rumoured to be haunted. Towards the end of the prologue the old woman walks to the window, and falls. Act I The scene goes back to the summer of 1925, when the tragedy happened at the Zhou mansion. Lu Gui and his daughter Sifeng, both servants of the Zhou household, are seen conversing in the drawing room. Lu Gui tells Sifeng about a secret affair between the old master's wife Fanyi and her stepson Zhou Ping. Sifeng is shocked to learn this because she and Zhou Ping are in a romantic relationship. Lu Gui also tells Sifeng that Fanyi invited her mother Mrs Lu to the house, possibly wishing to dismiss Sifeng for her involvement with Zhou Ping. A cough is heard and Fanyi enters. She is described as a refined and physically fragile woman with a passionate and resolute spirit. She learns from Sifeng that the old master had just returned from the mine a few days ago. She also questions Sifeng about Zhou Ping, showing great concern about him and jealousy at Sifeng. Zhou Chong, Fanyi's 17-year-old son returns from a game of tennis and excitedly tells Fanyi about his newfound love for Sifeng. He even wants to share his school allowance with her so she can attend school. Fanyi is shocked and unhappy to learn that her son had fallen for a low-class girl, but is happy to see her son's brave insistence to pursue love in spite of difficulty. Chong also tells Fanyi that Ping told him \\"he once loved a woman he should never have loved\\". Zhou Ping enters the room. He shows extreme discomfort at the sight of Fanyi. Soon afterward Zhou Puyuan, the old master and mine owner, enters with an air of authority. He tells the family of a workers' strike at the mine and reacts angrily when Chong sympathizes with the workers. Puyuan commands Fanyi to drink a traditional Chinese medicine concoction that he had ordered for her to cure her \\"mental imbalance\\". When Fanyi refuses, he becomes furious and orders Zhou Ping and Zhou Chong to kneel down and beg her to drink it. Eventually Fanyi relents, gulps down the medicine and leaves the room crying. After the other people have exited the room, Zhou Puyuan reproaches Zhou Ping for \\"behaving dishonourably\\". Zhou Ping is petrified as he assumes Puyuan is referring to his affairs with women in the household. To his surprise Puyuan merely expresses disapproval at his habit of heavy drinking and going to dance halls. Puyuan reminisces about a woman named Shiping, whose photograph he displays in the drawing room. In Puyuan's words, she is Zhou Ping's birth mother who supposedly died many years ago. Act II In the afternoon, Zhou Ping secretly meets Sifeng in the drawing room and tells her of his plans to leave his home permanently to work at his father's business in the country. Sifeng begs him not to leave her behind. Ping assures her of his love for her but does not respond to her plea. Instead he arranges to meet Sifeng at her house that evening. Fanyi enters after Sifeng has left and attempts to dissuade Ping from leaving the house and abandoning her. She tells him that she is unable to cope with Puyuan's abuse and expresses longing for Ping, and when Ping shows indifference, she angrily accuses both him and his father of hypocrisy and irresponsibility. Meanwhile, Ping expresses his regret for ever being involved with Fanyi and refuses to ever have anything to do with her again. The two end up in a heated argument and Ping leaves. Sifeng's mother Mrs Lu, a kind and beautiful woman, arrives for her appointment with Fanyi. Mrs Lu recognises herself in the photograph, implying that she is Shiping, Zhou Ping's birth mother and Puyuan's ex-wife. She does not communicate this information to Sifeng. In their meeting, Fanyi tells Mrs Lu that Zhou Chong is in love with Sifeng, and urges her to take Sifeng home to avoid potential scandal. Mrs Lu agrees to this request. Puyuan advises Fanyi that a psychiatrist has arrived to see Fanyi at his request. After she storms off in anger, he engages in conversation with Mrs Lu. After learning that she used to live in Wuxi, where he lived in his youth, he asks her if she knew where Shiping's grave is. Mrs Lu calmly tells him that although Shiping attempted suicide after being driven out of the Zhou family and leaving her first child (Zhou Ping) behind, she survived, gave birth to her and Puyuan's second son soon afterwards and married a poor man, who later became the father of her daughter. Eventually she reveals to Zhou Puyuan that she is indeed Shiping, who used to be a servant at the Zhou household where she had a relationship with Puyuan. Puyuan offers her money to atone for his sins, but she refuses and says she had decided to leave the city with her husband and daughter. Puyuan also learns from Shiping that their second son Lu Dahai is now working at his mine and is a leader in the workers' protests. Lu Dahai, not knowing that Puyuan is his father, arrives at the Zhou house and confronts Puyuan over his exploitation of workers. Puyuan tells him that all other representatives have agreed to call off the strike and that everyone has gone back to work except him. Lu Dahai is furious and insults Puyuan but is punched by Zhou Ping and pushed away by the servants. Mrs Lu exits with Dahai. Both Sifeng and Lu Gui are dismissed from the Zhou household. Fanyi learns of Ping's plan to visit Sifeng at her house and asks him not to go, saying that Sifeng is a lower-class woman not worthy of him. She ominously tells him that \\"A thunderstorm is coming\\", hinting at her plans for revenge. Act III The scene opens at Sifeng's house that evening, where Lu Gui unfairly accuses Dahai of causing his and Sifeng's dismissal and a brief family argument ensues. After Dahai and Mrs Lu leave, Lu Gui attempts to dissuade Sifeng from leaving the city with her mother. A knock is heard and Zhou Chong arrives to visit Sifeng. He apologizes for what happened that afternoon and offers one hundred dollars to Lu Gui as compensation. He tells Sifeng that although she turned down his proposal of marriage, he still wants to be friends with her and would like to use his allowance to pay for her schooling. He also tells her about his dream of a world where there is no conflict and everyone is equal. Lu Dahai returns and mistakenly thinks Chong is here to seduce Sifeng. Still angry over the events of the afternoon, he threatens Chong to never visit them again or he will break Chong's leg. Chong naively tries to explain his sympathy for the lower classes and offers to shake hands with Dahai. Eventually he gives up and returns to the Zhou mansion, his illusions half- shattered. Mrs Lu also mistakenly assumes that Sifeng and Chong are in love. Thinking of her own early experience with Puyuan, she warns Sifeng to stay away from the men of the Zhou family, not realising that Sifeng is already in a relationship with Ping, her half-brother. It is now midnight and Zhou Ping climbs through the window to visit Sifeng in her room. The lovers embrace. Fanyi's face appears briefly at the window. They are interrupted when Dahai enters the room to find bed planks. Mrs Lu begs Dahai not to hurt Ping. Zhou Ping escapes and Sifeng runs off in shame. Concerned about her safety, the family goes after her in the rain. Act IV It is 2am at the Zhou's living room, where Puyuan is reading over his work documents alone. Chong enters searching for his mother. Puyuan attempts to repair his relationship with Chong by talking to him, but Chong draws away in discomfort. Fanyi enters from the rain and acts coldly towards Puyuan. She even mocks him when he tells her to go to her room. Ping and Fanyi now find themselves alone in the drawing room after returning from the Lu's. In a disturbed state, Fanyi accuses Ping and his father of conspiring against her and driving her insane. Abandoning all restraint, she begs Ping to take her to the country, even if Sifeng comes with them. Although Ping appears to be overtaken by guilt, he refuses and storms out of the room. Fanyi calmly tears up Shiping's picture. Lu Dahai arrives at the Zhou's house searching for Sifeng and encounters Ping. He accuses Ping of ruining his sister's life and threatens to shoot him. Ping professes his love for Sifeng and promises that he will return and marry her. Dahai backs off after remembering his mother's warning against harming the Zhou family, and gives his pistol to Zhou Ping. Sifeng enters and is reunited with Ping, followed by Mrs Lu. Ping asks Sifeng to leave for the countryside with him immediately and she agrees. Mrs Lu, who is aware of their true status as half- siblings, does all she can to prevent them. Sifeng reveals that she is already pregnant with Zhou Ping's child. Seeing that nothing can be undone, Mrs Lu agrees under the condition that they flee as far as possible and never return. As they are about to exit, Fanyi enters with Chong in a desperate attempt at revenge. She tells Chong of Sifeng's relationship with Ping, hoping to inspire jealousy between the brothers. To her surprise Chong says that he is not really in love with Sifeng after all and wishes Sifeng a happy life with Ping. Having had her hopes shattered once more, Fanyi abandons all maternal sentiments and furiously tells everyone of her affair with Ping and his betrayal. Desperate, she calls for Puyuan to come and look at his son. Puyuan enters and, unaware of the romance between Ping and Sifeng, reveals that Mrs Lu is indeed Ping's mother and Sifeng and Ping are half-siblings. A deadly silence follows. Unable to face the truth, Sifeng runs outside, followed by Chong. They are both electrocuted after running into a broken electric wire. As Puyuan, Fanyi and Mrs Lu try to comprehend the loss of their children, a gunshot is heard as Zhou Ping commits suicide. Epilogue Back in the hospital ten years later, old Mr Zhou (Puyuan) asks a nun about the old woman (Mrs Lu). He tells the nun that he had been searching for the old woman's son Lu Dahai for ten years with no result. He approaches the old woman and calls out her name, but she does not respond. He is disappointed and sits down, gazing at the fire. Historical significance Although it is undisputed that the prodigious reputation achieved by Thunderstorm was due in large part to its scandalous public airing of the topic of incest, and many people have pointed out not inconsiderable technical imperfections in its structure, Thunderstorm is nevertheless considered to be a milestone in China's modern theatrical ascendancy.The Literature of China in the Twentieth Century - Page 177 Bonnie S. McDougall, Kam Louie - 1997 \\"Cao Yu (1910-96) Cao Yu's Thunderstorm is the most famous dramatic work of the pre-war period and possibly the most performed play\\" Even those who have questioned the literary prowess of Cao Yu, for instance, the noted critic C. T. Hsia, admit that the popularization and consolidation of China's theatrical genre is fundamentally owed to the first works of Cao Yu.C. T. Hsia, A History of Modern Chinese Fiction, Indiana University Press, third edition, 1999. () Comparative perspective Thunderstorm bears comparison with other works of ancient and contemporary drama, particularly drama dealing with the way the past haunts the present. In particular, Thunderstorm bears a strong resemblance in plot, themes, characterization, pacing and tone to the plays of Henrik Ibsen. For instance, Thunderstorm shares with Ibsen's Ghosts elements such as a respected patriarch who has, in fact, impregnated his servant, a romance between his children (who do not know that they are half-siblings), and a climactic revelation of this situation in the play. More generally, the book relates to the genre of classical tragedy, particularly the Oedipus cycle and other plays of Sophocles. English translations Thunderstorm was published in 1958 in an English translation by Wang Tso-liang and A.C. Barnes by Foreign Languages Press (Beijing). University Press of the Pacific published an English translation in 2001. Other adaptations and related works In 1938, after the play's theatrical triumphs, a film version was produced in Shanghai. Another film version was made in Hong Kong in 1957 (Lei Yu, dir. Ng Wui), which co-starred a young Bruce Lee in one of his few non-fighting roles. In 1995, Director Ho Yi produced a Cantonese film version in, with the personal blessing of the playwright. This film was released in 1996. Hangzhou-born composer Mo Fan composed a modern Chinese opera based on the play, with the same title (Leiyu, \\"Thunderstorm\\"). The opera was presented in 2001 by the Shanghai Opera House company.Shanghai Opera - Thunderstorm (2001) Another adaptation was the 2006 film Curse of the Golden Flower, directed and written by Zhang Yimou. This very loose adaptation set the action in the imperial court of the late Tang Dynasty, with the Emperor in the place of Puyuan. In 2012 Wang Chong directed Thunderstorm 2.0, a multimedia performance using four cameras and real-time editing, in Trojan House, Beijing. The adaptation, authorised by Cao Yu's family, cut 99% of the original text and only three major characters remained. The focus became Cao Yu's feminist view. The show was an immediate hit. The Beijing News noted it as one of the Best Ten Little Theater Works in China 1982‚Äì2012. It later toured Taipei Arts Festival, Israel Festival in Jerusalem, and Under the Radar Festival in New York, three festivals that no performance from China mainland has ever entered.

This is the simplest and broadest of the \\"Bertini theorems\\" applying to a linear system of divisors; simplest because there is no restriction on the characteristic of the underlying field, while the extensions require characteristic 0.Hartshorne, Ch. III.10.  Statement for hyperplane sections of smooth varieties Let X be a smooth quasi-projective variety over an algebraically closed field, embedded in a projective space \\\\mathbf P^n. Let H denote the complete system of hyperplane divisors in \\\\mathbf P^n. Recall that it is the dual space (\\\\mathbf P^n)^{\\\\star} of \\\\mathbf P^n and is isomorphic to \\\\mathbf P^n. The theorem of Bertini states that the set of hyperplanes not containing X and with smooth intersection with X contains an open dense subset of the total system of divisors H. The set itself is open if X is projective. If \\\\dim(X) \\\\ge 2, then these intersections (called hyperplane sections of X) are connected, hence irreducible. The theorem hence asserts that a general hyperplane section not equal to X is smooth, that is: the property of smoothness is generic. Over an arbitrary field k, there is a dense open subset of the dual space (\\\\mathbf P^n)^{\\\\star} whose rational points define hyperplanes smooth hyperplane sections of X. When k is infinite, this open subset then has infinitely many rational points and there are infinitely many smooth hyperplane sections in X. Over a finite field, the above open subset may not contain rational points and in general there is no hyperplanes with smooth intersection with X. However, if we take hypersurfaces of sufficientely big degrees, then the theorem of Bertini holds. Outline of a proof We consider the subfibration of the product variety X \\\\times H with fiber above x\\\\in X the linear system of hyperplanes that intersect X non-transversally at x. The rank of the fibration in the product is one less than the codimension of X \\\\subset \\\\mathbf P^n, so that the total space has lesser dimension than n and so its projection is contained in a divisor of the complete system H. General statement Over any infinite field k of characteristic 0, if X is a smooth quasi-projective k -variety, a general member of a linear system of divisors on X is smooth away from the base locus of the system. For clarification, this means that given a linear system f:X\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbf{P}^n , the preimage f^{-1}(H) of a hyperplane H is smooth -- outside the base locus of f -- for all hyperplanes H in some dense open subset of the dual projective space (\\\\mathbf{P}^n)^\\\\star . This theorem also holds in characteristic p>0 when the linear system f is unramified.  Generalizations  The theorem of Bertini has been generalized in various ways. For example, a result due to Steven Kleiman asserts the following (cf. Kleiman's theorem): for a connected algebraic group G, and any homogeneous G-variety X, and two varieties Y and Z mapping to X, let YœÉ be the variety obtained by letting œÉ ‚àà G act on Y. Then, there is an open dense subscheme H of G such that for œÉ ‚àà H, Y^\\\\sigma \\\\times_X Z is either empty or purely of the (expected) dimension dim Y + dim Z ‚àí dim X. If, in addition, Y and Z are smooth and the base field has characteristic zero, then H may be taken such that Y^\\\\sigma \\\\times_X Z is smooth for all \\\\sigma \\\\in H, as well. The above theorem of Bertini is the special case where X = \\\\mathbb P^n is expressed as the quotient of SLn by the parabolic subgroup of upper triangular matrices, Z is a subvariety and Y is a hyperplane. Theorem of Bertini has also been generalized to discrete valuation domains or finite fields, or for √©tale coverings of X. The theorem is often used for induction steps.

The park can be accessed from a number of directions, but visitors usually come by way of towns like Salcedo, Patate, Pillaro, Ba√±os, and Rio Verde. Ecology The park is divided into two ecological zones, the western zone and the eastern zone. The western zone is located in the Andean p√°ramo, high above the eastern zone. Here, visitors find a deserted landscape of mountainous peaks and high valleys. The area is populated mainly by South American camelids like vicu√±as, llamas and alpacas. The eastern zone is located on the eastern flanks of the Andes, with montane forests characterized by a rich diversity of plants and animals among the twisted forests of the upper Amazon. This area is highly unreachable, and is usually traversed only by foot. The large number of rivers, emptying out the Andes also makes this area difficult to cross. In recent years, several new species of plants have been discovered here, including several species of rare Andean Magnolia. Exploration In 2013, explorers from Ecuador, Britain, France, and America discovered and unearthed a 260 ft tall by 260 ft wide structure, made up of hundreds of two-ton stone blocks, and believe there could be more, similar constructions over an area of about a square mile.

Facts Eric Peter David and Ronald William Murphy ran Produce Marketing Consortium Ltd, importing lemons, grapefruit and oranges from Cyprus (previously, more Spain). It got shipped to Portsmouth. They were the only employees by the end (except David‚Äôs wife who did clerical work for ¬£70 per month). PMC was incorporated in 1964 as an amalgamation of three smaller businesses. David was director from the start, and owned half the shares. As other directors left and died, Murphy became the other director in 1974. He had no accountancy qualifications, but was an experienced bookkeeper. The company earned profit through a 3.5% commission on the gross sale price of the fruit which was imported through its agency. But the business was dropping because they lost business of a large Spanish exporter. They made losses of ¬£14K, ¬£25K and ¬£21K in 1981, 1982 and 1983, and a profit of ¬£43 in 1984, by which time there was a bank overdraft of ¬£91K. The report for that year was that, > ‚ÄúAt the balance sheet date, the company was insolvent but the directors are > confident that if the company continues to trade, it will be able to meet > its liabilities.‚Äù The auditor said the company‚Äôs continuation depended on the bank‚Äôs continued facilities. Banco Exterior SA took a secured debenture on 18 October 1983 on all property and assets, present and future, including good will, book debts and uncalled capital (but fixed assets were only ¬£5000). They also took a personal guarantee from David for ¬£30K. The draft accounts for 1984-6 were produced by auditors six months late in January 1987. They showed a ¬£55K loss and ¬£29K loss, with liabilities over assets reaching ¬£175K. Auditors warned of insolvent trading, if the bank did not give more credit. The bank did oblige in March, but less than before. The overdraft decreased, but debt to its most important Cypriot shipper increased to ¬£175K. The company was put in creditors‚Äô voluntary liquidation on 2 October 1987, with debts of ¬£317,694, half owed to one Cypriot shipping firm, as a trade creditor that brought them fruit. In 1988 the liquidator asked David and Murphy why there was trading while insolvent. David replied that they knew liquidation was inevitable in February with the accounts, and trading was continued because there was perishable fruit in cold store. The liquidator sought them to contribute ¬£107,946 each, plus costs the court saw fit. The liquidator argued that the right measure to contribute was the reduction in net assets caused by the wrongful trading. Miss Mary Arden QC was acting for the liquidator. Judgment Knox J held that ¬£75K should be contributed by both (not each). David should pay the first ¬£50K and above that they would be jointly liable. They should have concluded in July 1986 there was no reasonable prospect of avoiding this, and though they did not have the accounts till January 1987 they had an intimate knowledge of the business and must have known turnover was well down on previous years. s 214(4) was applied, so it did not matter that they may not have actually known about the accounts. They ought to have known the results for the financial year 1985-6. The two had not taken steps they should have under s 214(3). After February 1987, trading was not limited to realising the fruit in cold store. Overall, s 214 was compensatory, not penal, and the right amount to contribute was the amount caused to be depleted by the directors‚Äô conduct. The key parts of Knox J's decision were as follows.

For that he had the help of cearense Ademar Bezerra de Albuquerque, owner of ABAFILM, lent him the equipment and taught him to use it. The Get√∫lio Vargas government, which saw Abrah√£o as an enemy of the regime, seized his work. He was murdered at Serra Talhada (with 42 stab wounds)Mat√©ria , Virtual Books, p√°gina pesquisada em 12 de fevereiro de 2008. without either the killer or the motivation for the crime ever surfacing. =Lampi√£o's Letter= Lampi√£o himself wrote a letter, certifying that his pictures were taken by Abrah√£o. Note: The text below is a translation from the Portuguese original letter wrote by Lampi√£o. It is important to highlight that Lampi√£o was semi- alphabetized and the text may have many errors in the Portuguese version \`\` Recordings Abrah√£o had to work out how to record the group that was running away from the government's increasingly violent pursuit. The meeting occurred in an isolated place of the Brazilian Caatinga, where the cangaceiro leader, very suspicious of the man's intentions, he did the first recordings with the photographic equipment himself. Only then did he allow Abrah√£o to record. Abrah√£o then returned to Fortaleza with his work obtained more resources to take more pictures of the group. Some started considering Abrah√£o a suspect because he sent pictures and articles to newspapers describing their adventures, but also for his knowledge of the whereabouts of the group.

He is a regular presence on the stages of opera houses and concert halls around the world. Griffey has also been noted for his acting talent in addition to his voice. In 2007 he starred alongside Audra McDonald and Patti Lupone in The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny at the Los Angeles Opera, the recording of which won two Grammy Awards. In the 2005 edition of Musical America Griffey was cited as one of twelve young singers of distinction. Griffey was honored as an inductee into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2011. In 2015, he was appointed as Professor of Voice at the Eastman School of Music. Richard Dyer of the Boston Globe has said: \\"Griffey has voice, technique, musicianship, diction, and poetry in his soul.\\" Early life and education Anthony Dean Griffey was born in High Point, North Carolina to a family of little means. His parents worked at local furniture factories. He first began singing at the age of five at church. He started to study voice in high school, and subsequently attended Wingate University as a music major, with the intention of becoming a music minister. At the encouragement of his teachers at Wingate, Griffey auditioned successfully for the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, where he studied with John Maloy. Griffey majored in vocal performance and literature, receiving a Master's of Music/Performer's Certificate. After completing his studies at Eastman, he was recommended by Rita Shane and Renee Fleming to audition at The Juilliard School for Beverley Peck Johnson, who would become Griffey's teacher and mentor until her death in 2001. Shortly after entering Juilliard he auditioned for James Levine and joined the Metropolitan Opera's Lindemann Young Artist's program. Career While in the Lindemann program he made his debut at the Met in 1995 playing the First Knight in Parsifal. From 1995 to 2003 he continued to regularly appear in supporting roles at the Met, in such operas as Aida, Manon, Billy Budd, Die Zauberflote, Susannah, The Flying Dutchman, The Queen of Spades, Boris Godunov, Salome, Tristan und Isolde, Don Carlo, among others. Griffey's first major career breakthrough came in 1996 when, after auditioning for the role of Bob Boles in a student production of Peter Grimes at Tanglewood Festival, the conductor, Seiji Ozawa, was so impressed by his singing that he offered him the title role instead. Griffey later reprised this role in 1998 at the Metropolitan Opera, filling in for an indisposed Chris Merritt. Grimes would become Griffey's signature role, which he has performed to critical acclaim in Glyndebourne, Opera Bastille, Japan, San Diego, and Santa Fe, culminating in 2008, when the Metropolitan Opera mounted a new production of Grimes starring Griffey. Of the latter production, Justin Davidson of New York Magazine called Griffey's interpretation \\"one of the most richly textured and subtle characters to dominate the Met's vast stage in a long time.\\" Ozawa would become a major figure in Griffey's career, inviting him to sing the tenor solo in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, as well as featuring him in a recording of War Requiem with the Saito Kinen Orchestra. In 1997, Griffey took on a role which would also become one of his signatures: Lennie in Carlisle Floyd's Of Mice and Men at the Glimmerglass Festival. He performed the role of Lennie to great success places such as Bregenz, the New York City Opera, the Houston Grand Opera (where he recorded it, as well) and for the Opera Australia at Sydney and Melbourne. For his performances as Lennie in Australia, the 2012 Green Room Awards presented Griffey with the title of best Principal Male Opera performance. He was presented with the 2012 Helpmann Award for Best Male Opera Performance for his appearances as Lennie in Australia. Other roles which Griffey has performed are Mozart's Idomeneo (at Mostly Mozart festival) Florestan in Beethoven's Fidelio (Opera Company of Philadelphia and the Florentine Opera), the Male Chorus in The Rape of Lucretia at the Houston Grand Opera, and the title role in Robert Kurka's The Good Soldier Schweik at the Glimmerglass Festival In 2007, he starred as Jimmy Mahoney in Kurt Weill's Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny with the Los Angeles Opera. His performance was widely acclaimed, with Opera News describing his Jimmy as: \\"...a sensation. His well-knit voice, ranging from a hefty lower range to a clarion top, had no need for the production's microphones. His way with \\"When the sky turns brighter\\" was particularly haunting, evoking pathos on the scale of 'E lucevan le stelle.'\\" This production was recorded on DVD, and subsequently was awarded the 2009 Grammy Awards for \\"Best Classical Album\\" and \\"Best Opera Recording\\". In 2010 Griffey performed the title role in Igor Stravinsky's Oedipus Rex at Avery Fisher Hall with the New York Philharmonic under the baton of Valery Gergiev. He champions English-language vocal literature. At his New York recital debut at Zankel Hall, he premiered a new song cycle by Andr√© Previn, accompanied by the composer himself. Of this recital, Peter G. Davis of New York Magazine remarked: \\"Griffey sang everything utterly naturally, devoid of artifice yet still full of character and nuance ... This is a big vocal talent.\\" Previn selected Griffey to perform and record the role of Mitch in his opera version of A Streetcar Named Desire at the San Francisco Opera. In 2013, he reprised the role of Mitch to critical acclaim in the New York premiere at Carnegie Hall and at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. Griffey has been a frequent performer of concert repertoire, and has appeared with many of the world's leading orchestras including the New York Philharmonic, Boston Symphony, London Philharmonic, Montreal Symphony, Toronto Symphony, Vancouver Symphony, Orchestre de Paris, London Symphony Orchestra, Atlanta Symphony, St. Luke's Chamber Orchestra, Milwaukee Symphony, Minnesota Orchestra, Houston Symphony, Philadelphia Orchestra, Royal Scottish National Orchestra, RAI National Symphony Orchestra, San Diego Symphony, Vara Radio Orchestra - Amsterdam, The Halle, NHK Symphony Orchestra, Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Seattle Symphony, Chicago Symphony, Tonhalle Orchester Z√ºrich, Munich Philharmonic Orchestra, Orquesta Nacional de Espa√±a, and the Berlin Philharmonic.

Geological Survey of Canada, Annual Report (new series), 1890-91, v. 5, Part 1, p. 1-67. Impermeable marine shales in the Clearwater Formation provided part of the trapping mechanism for the underlying Athabasca oil sands in the McMurray Formation. Sandstone units in the Clearwater Formation, including the Wabiskaw Member, can contain oilsand and heavy oil resources.Glass, D.J. (editor) 1997. Lexicon of Canadian Stratigraphy, vol. 4, Western Canada including eastern British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba. Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists, Calgary, 1423 p. on CD-ROM. . Nearly complete specimens of plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs, as well as one ankylosaur, have been recovered from the formation during oilsand mining. Lithology The Clearwater Formation consists of primarily of black and green shale, with some interbedded grey and green sandstone and siltstone, and ironstone concretions. To the southeast of Cold Lake it includes massive hydrocarbon-bearing, glauconitic salt-and-pepper sandstones with interbedded shales. =Wabiskaw Member= The Wabiskaw Member forms the base of the Clearwater Formation. It consists of glauconitic sandstones with interbeds of black fissile shale, and it includes oilsand and heavy oil in some areas. It was defined in well Barnsdall West Wabiskaw No. 1 (located between Wabasca River and Lesser Slave Lake in central Alberta) by P.C. Badgley in 1952.Badgley, Peter C., 1952. Notes on the subsurface stratigraphy and oil and gas geology of the Lower Cretaceous series in central Alberta (Report and seven figures); Geological Survey of Canada, Paper No. 52-11, page 12 Distribution The Clearwater Formation is present in the subsurface of northeastern and central Alberta, and is exposed on lower course of the Athabasca River, as well as along the Christina River, a tributary of the Clearwater River southeast of Fort McMurray. It reaches a maximum thickness of on the Athabasca River, thins out to in the Cold Lake area, and wedges out towards the south. It is not present south of Edmonton. Relationship to other units The Clearwater Formation is part of the Mannville Group. It is conformably overlain by the Grand Rapids Formation and conformably overlies the McMurray Formation. It is equivalent to the Bluesky Formation and the lower Spirit River Formation in the Peace River region, and may be equivalent to the Cummings Member in the Lloydminster region. Paleontology The Clearwater Formation was deposited in marine, near-shore and estuarine environments on the eastern side of the Western Interior Seaway, and it contains marine and, rarely, terrestrial fossils. Workers at mines near Fort McMurray have made a number of significant finds while removing Clearwater strata to expose underlying oilsand deposits. Several plesiosaurs such as Nichollssaura, and ichthyosaurs such as Athabascasaurus, some of them nearly complete, have been recovered at Syncrude Canada Ltd.'s mines, and a complete Borealopelta has been recovered at the Suncor Millennium Mine. Plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs were large marine reptiles, but the anklyosaur was an armoured dinosaur and represents a terrestrial animal that became entombed in the sea floor approximately from the nearest known paleo-shoreline. Its bloated carcass probably washed out to sea and floated for several days before sinking to the sea floor. All of the specimens now reside at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology. Oil/gas production The formation contains oilsand in the Cold Lake and Primrose Lake region. Heavy oil is produced from the loose sandstones of the Wabiskaw Member by means of horizontal drilling in the Wabasca oil field, and the Wabiskaw contains surface-mineable oilsand in the Fort McMurray area. The oilsands of the Clearwater Formation are more difficult to tap than those of the McMurray Formation.

Extraction  Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) = Canadian Natural Resources use \\"employs cyclic steam or \\"huff and puff\\" technology to develop bitumen resources. This technology requires one well bore and the production consists of the injection and production phases. First steam is \\"injected for several weeks, mobilizing cold bitumen\\". Then the flow \\"on the injection well is reversed producing oil through the same injection well bore. The injection and production phases together comprise one cycle. \\"Steam is re-injected to begin a new cycle when oil production rates fall below a critical threshold due to the cooling of the reservoir.\\" = High pressure cyclic steam stimulation (HPCSS) = \\"Roughly 35 per cent of all in situ production in the Alberta oil sands uses a technique called High Pressure Cyclic Steam Stimulation (HPCSS), which cycles between two phases: first, steam is injected into an underground oilsands deposit to soften the bitumen; then, the resulting hot mixture of bitumen and steam (called a \\"bitumen emulsion\\") is pumped up to the surface. The process is then repeated multiple times.\\" An Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) news release explained the difference between high pressure cyclic steam stimulation (HPCSS) and steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). \\"HPCSS has been used in oil recovery in Alberta for more than 30 years. The method involves injecting high-pressure steam into a reservoir over a prolonged period of time. As heat softens the bitumen and water dilutes and separates the bitumen from the sand, the pressure creates cracks and openings through which the bitumen can flow back into the steam-injector wells. HPCSS differs from steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) operations where steam is injected at lower pressures without fracturing the reservoir and uses gravity drainage as the primary recovery mechanism.\\" Canadian Natural Resources Limited's (CNRL) Primrose and Wolf Lake in situ oil sands project near Cold Lake, Alberta in the Clearwater Formation, operated by CNRL subsidiary Horizon Oil Sands, use the high pressure cyclic steam stimulation (HPCSS).

Recommendations The main recommendations of the committee were: # The 3-tier system of Panchayati Raj should be replaced by the 2-tier system: Zilla Parishad at the district level, and below it, the Mandal Panchayat consisting of a group of villages covering a population of 15000 to 20000. # A district should be the first point for decentralisation under popular supervision below the state level. # Zila Parishad should be the executive body and made responsible for planning at the district level. # There should be an official participation of political parties at all levels of Panchayat elections. # The Panchayat Raj institutions should have compulsory powers of taxation to mobilise their own financial resources. # There should be a regular social audit by a district level agency and by a committee of legislators to check whether the funds allotted for the vulnerable social and economic groups are actually spent on them. # The state government should not supersede the Panchayat Raj institutions. In case of an imperative supersession, election should be held within 6 months from the date of supersession. # The Nyaya Panchayats should be kept as separate bodies from that of development Panchayats. They should be presided over by a qualified judge. # The Chief Electoral Officer of the state in consultation with the Chief Election Commissioner should organise and conduct the Panchayati Raj elections. # Development functions should be transferred to the Zila Parishad and all development staff should work under its control and supervision. # The voluntary agencies should play an important role in mobilising the support of the people for Panchayati Raj. # A minister for Panchayati Raj should be appointed in the state council of ministers to look after the affairs of the Panchayati Raj institutions. # Seats for SCs and Sts should be reserved on the basis of their population. # A Constitutional recognition should be accorded to the Panchayati Raj institutions. This would give them the requisite status and an assurance of continuous functioning.
