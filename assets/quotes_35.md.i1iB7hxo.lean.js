Slave Population  The Red Hills Plantation was tended by an enslaved labor force of twenty four people. This population included 35.2% of children, 23% of people aged 25‚Äì44, and 23.5% of people over the age of 45. In 1930, the Red Hills District included seventy six white families and three negro families. Many of these slaves lie in the slave cemetery, previously a part of the Red Hills property.  Slave Cemetery  A half a mile to the south of the main house there is a small cemetery that contains the remains of at least 21 enslaved laborers who lived on the Red Hills Plantation. The graves contain upright fieldstone markers, many with indecipherable carvings and some with matching footstones. Additional unmarked depressions were also found, which may contain more remains. The cemetery is located on the curve of the old road bed. It is believed that this road once lead from the plantation house to the cemetery. The cemetery is no longer a part of the Red Hills Plantation because of land sales and construction.  Standards of Living  The Virginia Farm Whites averaged 4.5 persons per family and 5 persons per household. White homes are relatively scattered throughout the property. The average size of a slave family was 3.9 persons and the average size of each household was 4.8 persons. Enslaved laborers housing were found fairly close to one another. The average distance from this housing to drinking water was 100-200 yards. Six families had to travel over a half mile for water. There was no \\"negro\\" doctor living within the Red Hills area. A colored physician must have been called from the Charlottesville, VA, area, which was a long trip with a high fee. Doctors were only called in extreme necessity.  Church Membership  A majority of white people from the Red Hills area belonged to churches in the Charlottesville, VA, area. Prior to the Civil War, there were no colored churches in the Red Hill area. Following the war, several were created at South Garden, Chestnut Grove, and Cross Roads, all of which were Baptist. Both the negro men and women show a higher percentage of church attendance than white men and women.  Schools for Enslaved Laborers  One-third of enslaved laborer families lived within a mile of colored schools, while half of them live up to two and a half miles. Walking to school created considerable danger due to automobiles. It is typical of these students to drop out following their third year of attendance.

Gaal Pari (Cheek Fairy), Vijhdar Pari (Electric Fairy), Baal Pari (Tress Fairy), Atkaati Pari (Obstacle Fairy), Aarpar Pari (Across Fairy), Bhatkati Pari (Wander Fairy), Natkhat Pari (Naughty Fairy) and Rani Pari (Queen Fairy) give magical powers to Baal Veer to help them fight an evil fairy Bhayankar Pari (Frightening Fairy), who wants to become the queen of Pari Lok (Fairy Realm). Years ago, Maa Pari (Mother Fairy) gave Pari Lok's (Fairy Realm's) throne to Bahuroopi Pari (Disguise Fairy) instead of Bhayankar Pari, who, at that time was Bhali Pari (Good Fairy), so she returns to take revenge from Maa Pari and Rani Pari. Baal Veer is sent to Earth to help children and to save Earth from Bhayankar Pari and the wrath of other cunning and cruel, evil fairies. Baal Veer stays with the Dagli family on Earth as Ballu. The family has seven members who never lie, even at the time of difficult circumstances, including Manav and Meher, who later receive powers from Rani Pari (they were made Baal Mitra and Baal Sakhi, respectively) and help Baal Veer in his quests and adventures.

It is headquartered in Washington, D.C., with an office in Brussels, Belgium. History Light aircraft manufacturers in the United States were typically members of the Aerospace Industries Association (originally called the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce), which represented all aircraft manufacturers in the U.S. catering to military aviation, commercial aviation and general aviation. Increasing division of interests and priorities, and the disproportionate power of the military and commercial aircraft manufacturers, led to the establishment of a new organization to represent general aviation aircraft manufacturers. The organization was established as the Utility Aircraft Council, until its director died suddenly.

Furthermore, Simmons was one of the few private colleges not to impose admission quotas on Jewish students for the first half of the 1900s. The undergraduate program is women- centered, with approximately 1800 students enrolled in the 2012‚Äì2013 academic year. The graduate schools (Library and Information Science, Social Work, Health Sciences, Business Management, and an Arts and Sciences program that provides degrees in Education, Communications Management, Gender and Cultural Studies, Public Policy and Liberal Arts) are coed, and have about 3,000 students. The school's MBA program is the first in the world designed specifically for women. The co-ed online MBA program, MBA@Simmons, was founded in 2016. In November 2014, the institution released an explicit policy on the acceptance of transgender students, claiming a strong tradition of empowering women and challenging traditional gender roles and a \\"rich history of inclusion.\\" Its undergraduate program accepts applicants who are assigned female at birth as well as those who self-identify as women, making Simmons the third women-centered college in the United States to accept transgender women. Government documentation of gender is not required. Graduate programs are co-educational, so gender identity is not of concern. The original site of the Simmons College Graduate School of Social Work is featured on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail. In 2018 Simmons College decided to change their name to Simmons University after reorganizing the structure of the school. Campus Simmons University currently consists of two separate campuses located near the Back Bay Fens in Boston: Academic Campus The Academic Campus is located at 300 The Fenway in the Longwood Medical Area. It is immediately adjacent to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and the Boston Latin School. This campus currently consists of five buildings: Simmons College Main College Building * One Palace Road * Main College Building * Beatley Library/Lefavour Hall * Park Science Center * School of Management Building (a recent green construction) Residential Campus The Residence Campus is located one block from the main campus. It is near the Landmark Center and the Fenway and Longwood MBTA stations. The residence campus consists of 13 buildings centered on a grassy quad: * Simmons Hall (Freshman and Sophomore housing) * Dix Hall (Sophomore housing) * Smith Hall (Senior housing, also houses Quadside lounge and mail-room) * Arnold Hall (Junior housing) * North Hall (Upperclassman and Graduate housing) * Health Center and Residence Life Offices * Holmes Sports Center * South Hall (Wellness housing) * Alumnae Hall (Multipurpose room) * Bartol Dining Hall (also houses late- night dining service Bartol Late Night) * Evans Hall (Senior housing) * Mesick Hall (Freshman and Sophomore housing, renovated in 2010) * Morse Hall (Freshman and Sophomore housing) Most of the buildings on the residence campus serve as dormitories, but the campus also includes a large dining hall, a health center, a large fitness center, a public safety office, an auditorium, and several other facilities. The residence campus is separated from the main campus by Emmanuel College and Merck Research Laboratories Boston. Academics Simmons University reorganized its academic structure in 2018 to foster interdisciplinary learning and cross-departmental collaboration. Students now explore new inter-professional opportunities and create their own pathways to meaningful work. * College of Natural, Behavioral, and Health Sciences **School of Nursing * College of Organizational, Computational, and Information Sciences **School of Library and Information Science (SLIS), est. 1902 **School of Business * College of Social Sciences, Policy, and Practice **School of Social Work * The Gwen Ifill College of Media, Arts, and Humanities COVID pandemic Simmons extended its Spring 2020 break to March 23 and then resumed instruction on a remote online only basis. The campus and residence halls closed. Simmons cancelled all summer instructions and programs, and the Fall 2020 semester is online only. Athletics Simmons University sponsors athletics teams in a variety of sports including crew, cross country, field hockey, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming & diving, tennis, and volleyball. The mascot is the Sharks and the colors are blue and yellow. They compete as members of the NCAA Division III in the Great Northeast Athletic Conference (GNAC),the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) and the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC). Sustainability Simmons has made several significant sustainability efforts. Former President Susan Scrimshaw signed the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment (ACUPCC) as a formal commitment to eliminate campus greenhouse gas emissions over time. Furthermore, the School of Management is addressing sustainability in its curriculum as well as in building and resource-management programs. Simmons' environmental efforts earned the school a \\"C\\" on the College Sustainability Report Card 2010, published in Fall 2009 by the Sustainable Endowments Institute.

There he served as the TJX/Feldberg Chair in Computer Science. He has performed research in algorithms, parsing and compiling, memory management, logic and constraint logic programming, and parallelism. Cohen has published extensively, frequently with undergraduate and graduate students. Pioneering many aspects of modern computer science, Cohen's work includes experimentation, education, and research, directed and carried out at many institutions of higher learning, including Brandeis University, Brown University, MIT, Wellesley College, and French universities in the cities of Marseilles, Grenoble, and Nancy. In 1997, the Association for Logic Programming recognized Cohen as one of the fifteen \\"Founders of Logic Programming\\".  Biography  In Belo Horizonte, Cohen attended the Engineering School of the State University of Minas Geraes. He graduated with a degree in Civil Engineering and a medal for having attained the best grades awarded in the preceding several years. Shortly after his graduation, Cohen was granted a Brazilian government scholarship for pursuing graduate studies in the USA. At that time, Cohen decided to become a structural engineer. In the mid 1950s Cohen attended the Master‚Äôs program at the University of Florida, Gainesville. Cohen continued graduate study at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he pursued a doctorate in Structural Design. His doctoral dissertation involved energy minimization using Raleigh-Ritz methods to determine Fourier series coefficients defining shapes of buckling columns made of thin-walled plates. This particular topic enabled Cohen to learn a great deal of assembly language programming and the solution of systems of non-linear equations resulting from the energy minimization process. During his long career in Boston, Cohen interacted closely with Jean van Heijenoort, his colleague in the Philosophy department at Brandeis who imbued Cohen with his passion for mathematical logic.  Early career  After graduating from Illinois, Cohen returned to Brazil and practiced programming on the Burroughs 205, an early electronic computer. In the early 1960s, Cohen obtained a summer position at the Bull computer company in Paris (also known as Groupe Bull) where he was assigned to the operations research group, programming in Algol 60. Cohen was invited to participate as a researcher in the compiler group in the Applied Mathematics Institute at the University of Grenoble. He was hired as a member of the National French Research Center (CNRS). As members of the compiler group, Cohen and his colleagues were encouraged to test the compiler being developed by writing all sorts of programs, especially recursive ones. It was in Grenoble that he became interested in syntax-directed compilers. It was a unique opportunity to participate in the meetings of the IFIP group that was then designing the successor of Algol 60. Using the Grenoble Algol 60, Cohen started developing many programs, including a Lisp-embedding in Algol, a number of parsing algorithms, and a miniature Algol compiler written in Algol. Cohen‚Äôs doctoral dissertation in Grenoble was concerned with languages for writing compilers.  Later career  After his time in France, Cohen was offered a research position in MIT‚Äôs Civil Engineering department, which he held for one year. In 1968, Cohen was offered an academic position at Brandeis University and has been associated with that university ever since. As the founder of the Computer Science Department at Brandeis University, Cohen held the position of chair for almost twelve years, beginning in the early 1980s. In 1984, Cohen directed a team at Brandeis developing software to measure the efficiency of other software programs. During his time as chair, he brought many grants to the department, from NSF to the CISE grant, which was given for the study of parallel algorithms. During Cohen's long academic career, some highlights include: being invited to teach a compiler course at Brown University for several years, as well as at MIT; being awarded a chair in Computer Science by the Feldberg family in association with their enterprises (Zayre and later TJMaxx); serving as the chairman of the Computer Science department for thirteen years; and finally being appointed as editor-in-chief of one of the most prestigious professional journals, the Communications of the ACM, where his tenure spanned for four years.

Early history The castle is located on a rocky ridge that stretches westward from the center of the old town of Florennes. There are early records of construction of a wooden castle in Florennes in 842. In 944 Count Eilbert replaced the wooden building with a stone castle surrounded by walls. Eilbert, lord of Florennes, died on 28 March 977. His daughter Alpa√Øde de Hoegarde (c. 921‚Äì986) married Godefroi de Juliers, a Count of Hainaut, and their sons Godefroi and then Arnoul inherited Florennes. The town and castle, owned by Arnoul's grandson Godefroi IV de Florennes (c. 1010 ‚Äì 1080), became a fief of the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge in 1070. The powerful Rumigny-Florennes family held the castle as vassals of Li√®ge until the late 13th century. In 1281 Isabelle de Rumigny, who had inherited the castle, married Thibaut of Lorraine, lord of Neufchateau. Thibaut was a warrior prince, and fought in the wars between the kings of France, the emperors of Germany and other potentates. He was in the ranks of the French at the disastrous Battle of Courtrai on 9 June 1302. Thibaut became Duke of Lorraine on 31 December 1303, and had to fight a revolt of his subjects. At one point he lost control of the castle to the prince-bishop of Li√®ge, but it was restored on 6 June 1307. The castle was badly damaged during a siege in 1408. Starting in 1417 Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine, undertook work that included building the terrace and, in 1425, laying out a park. A document from 1420 states that the people of Surice, Maz√©e, Vodel√©e, Soulme, Omez√©e, Villers-en-Fagne, Roly, Neuville, Vodec√©e, Villers-le-Gambon, Franchimont, Corenne and Anth√©e were required to mount guard over the castle. The castle was damaged again in a siege in 1430. Around 1465 it was said that the castle of the town of Florine was fortified with ditches, bulwarks and other defensive works. These walls still existed in 1517, and the castle was accessed over a drawbridge. The house of Lorraine owned the castle until 1556. Later events The old castle and the city, 2005 From 1556 to 1771 the castle was owned by the House of Glymes-Jodoigne. On 14 December 1570 Jean de Glymes, Baron of Florennes and Governor of Philippeville, and his wife Rene√© de Vaudemont wrote a will leaving their eldest son Charles de Glymes the land and baronetcy of Florennes. Jean de Glymes died in the castle on 2 July 1575. The Queen of Navarre, Margaret of Valois, sought refuge in the castle in 1577. She reached the lower court of the castle, but the wife of the lord of the castle refused her admittance in her husband's absence. Don John of Austria, hearing that the queen was staying at the castle, sent 300 men to cut the road and capture the castle. Thinking the queen was within the castle, they camped some way away, planning to take it the next day. The situation was serious but the queen's pleas for sanctuary went unheeded. Finally Charles de Glymes arrived. He reproved his wife and granted the queen admittance. He then provided an escort back to Paris. The castle passed to the Beaufort-Spontin family in 1771. In 1794 the French revolutionaries seized the castle from its owner, the Duke of Beaufort-Spontin, who had emigrated. In 1800 the municipality of Florennes declared that the castle was a national asset and could not be sold. The Beaufort-Spontins regained the property after the restoration of the monarchy. In 1893, the Beaufort-Spontin family sold the castle and its outbuildings. It was resold to the French Jesuits in 1902, after religious schools had been suppressed in France. They used it for their Saint-Jean Berchmans college, and in 1905 built a novitiate at the southern end of the park. During World War I the castle was used as a hospital by the French army and then by the German army. The castle was occupied by the German army again in 1940. In 1942 it was transferred to the air force, who installed an air command post in the novitiate, which was destroyed by fire when they left in 1944. The castle was then occupied by American troops. In 1950 the Jesuits sold the castle and part of the park to the Missions Seminary (S√©minaire des Missions) for use as a free girls school. For the last thirty years the Missions Seminary has leased the castle to the Municipality of Florennes, who in turn have rented it to the Justice of the Peace and the Music Academy. The process of registering the castle buildings and the park with the Institut du Patrimoine as a Wallon Heritage site were initiated in May 2004. Some of the building could continue to be used for educational purposes, while other parts would be restored. The Heritage Department would cover 60% of the costs of restoration. Structural changes Most of the fortifications were destroyed in 1704 on the orders of Louis XIV of France, but some towers and ramparts were still standing in 1740. The chateau and grounds around 1744 A 1744 travel book Les D√©lices du Pa√Øs de Liege (\\"The Delights of the country of Liege\\") described the property as having several large gothic buildings flanked with towers, and a large garden laid out in excellent taste. A terrace and gallery were decorated with elegant pillars surmounted by statues, and looked over a parterre with a fountain in the center. The garden was laid out with wide paths and held an √©toile, or star- shaped design of clipped hedges, a labyrinth and two ponds, each with an island containing a formal garden in the center. The chateau at that time was property of the Count of Glimes de Jodogne, Marquis de Florennes and de Courcelles. Of the medieval castle, all that remains today are two towers connected by a curtain wall along the west side of the courtyard. This wall may well date to the 13th century. The tower on the right is called \\"the archives\\". A fire in 1862 damaged the upper part of \\"this tower and the wall. They were restored and improved, refinished in limestone and decorated with niches. The tower on the left, overlooking the park, was rebuilt in 1868 on the base of a medieval tower. The main building was built or reconstructed in the 16th century. The thickness of the outer wall indicates that this was once part of the old south curtain wall. The \\"Billard\\" tower at the far right when viewed from the park was enlarged and resurfaced in 1830. The orangery, a lower extension running from the main building to the \\"Billard\\" tower, was built between 1825 and 1844 on foundations that date from the 18th century. A passage from beneath the building now gives access to stairs that led down to the park, built at the start of the 18th century. A south-facing terrace overlooks the park, which includes a stream-fed pond and has some extremely old trees.

The purpose of deep plowing is to modify the soil water retention characteristics over the long term. In one long-term test, lasting 35 years, the mean annual grain yield was 2,800 lbs per acre (3,138 kg per ha) with deep plowing, which was 10% greater than the 2,550 lbs per acre (2,858 kg per ha) yield in unplowed plots. Under certain conditions, it is recommended to use deep plowing in preparing the soil for planting new vineyards. There is a movement away from plowing altogether and from deep plowing in particular. The theory is that this will stop the loss of topsoil, increase the organic content of soil and reduce runoff of fertilizer and pesticides into rivers.

Strata MetaWatch and Frame MetaWatch are digital smartwatches released in 2012, funded by raising money via the crowd funding platform Kickstarter. MetaWatch is a company founded by former Fossil engineers.  History  The first generation of MetaWatch watches was released as a development system in September 2011. Two models were sold - analog with OLED displays (model WDS111, style AU1000) and fully digital (model WDS112, style AU2000). Both were provided with a clip for charging, flashing, and debugging.http://metawatch.org/assets/images/developers/MetaWatch_Reflash_your_Watch_Firmware_2.0.pdf For wireless connection, Bluetooth 2.1 is used via a TI CC2560 module. As a serial RAM Microchip 23A640 serial is used. Unofficial first and half generation was extended of Bluetooth 4.0 capability. Style numbers for these watches were AU2001 and AU2004. The second generation of MetaWatch had Bluetooth 4.0, a KXTI9 accelerometer instead of KXTF9 (using less active power), and larger battery. The 4 pins on the back of the case were multiplexed and could be either used with Spy-Bi-Wire (serialized version of JTAG) or serial out/ground. External serial RAM was larger. The clip provided with watches was for charging and reflash only. A JTAG clip for development could be bought separately. The company has now \\"ceased business operations\\" according to their automatic email response. Also, their website has been taken over by a new party.  Models  Second generation watches were sold under names Strata (model code SW12-1) and Frame (model code SW12-2). Strata has Water Resistant Mark 5 and Frame has Water Resistant Mark 3. The Strata, which was focused more on value, was bulkier but more durable with its double injection-moulded polyurethane body. It was also cheaper as the Kare model retailed for $140. The Frame, on the other hand, was the variant targeted towards the fashion segment. The device featured a slimmer stainless steel build, smaller display, leather bands and a price tag of $199. The Strata model was initially offered as an iOS-only device due to challenges in developing a version for the Android platform. An Android-compatible version was later released. In 2014, Metawatch announced Meta M1, a premium smartwatch developed in collaboration with Frank Nuovo. The designer was known for his iconic works at Vertu and Nokia, where he served as a Vice President and Chief of Design. The device was launched at the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show.

It typically consisted of bread, cheese, milk, half an apple and half an orange. The original Norwegian name for the meal was Oslofrokosten (\\"the Oslo breakfast\\"). The Oslo Breakfast had been designed by professor Carl Schi√∏tz to be as healthy as possible, with widely reported studies suggesting it delivered excellent results for the children's long-term health. During the 1930s the Oslo breakfast became famous and was copied by programs in Scandinavia, Europe, and the wider world. Many of these initiatives were small scale however, sometimes restricted to just a single school. By the late 1950s the provision of Oslo breakfasts by schools had largely ceased; sometimes they were replaced by more popular hot meal provision, or sometimes just dropped altogether as rising prosperity meant the provision of free school meals was seen as less necessary. Ingredients While there was some variation in the meal, its typical ingredients included: * Two slices of wholemeal bread (Kneippbr√∏d) spread with margarine * A slice of cheese * Half a pint of milk * Half an apple and half an orange Extra ingredients might include slices of raw uncooked vegetable, such as carrots or swedes. Between autumn and spring, a dose of cod liver oil could be included. History Children at a school in Oslo The earliest known modern advocate for school dinners was Count Rumford, who oversaw a program to feed and educate children in late 18th-century Germany. Oslo, or Christiana as it was then known, began to provide midday hot school meals in 1897. These meals were criticized by food scientists such as Axel Holst from as early as 1909 for not being nutritious. In the 1920s, there was still considerable poverty in Norway, including in Oslo, leading to poor nutrition. Carl Schi√∏tz designed the Oslo breakfast using the best scientific knowledge available at the time to make it nutritious, and began advocating for it to replace the traditional hot meal from about 1927. He later published results of experiments which found that when fed on the breakfast instead of the hot meal, the often-undernourished Oslo school children would gain more weight. As well as being a professor, Schi√∏tz was also a senior official in the Oslo municipal authorities, which helped him achieve the practical implementation of his ideas. By 1932, the city was providing the Oslo breakfast to all primary school children. Later older children were also given the meal. It was provided free of charge to all, to prevent poor children from being stigmatized if they had to apply to get it at no cost. The Oslo breakfast was the most famous of a number of similar worldwide developments in the 1920s and 1930s, for governmental and educational authorities to provide school children with more nutritious food. Perhaps the second most famous example was Lord Boyd-Orr's work in Scotland, which showed the benefits of giving school children free milk ‚Äì this led to universal school milk provision across Scotland and later the whole of Great Britain. From the 1930s to 1950s, programs based on the Oslo breakfast soon spread to other Norwegian cities, across Scandinavia, the rest of Europe, and to the wider world, including countries like Australia and Canada. As an example of the positive reports from trials of the breakfast, Jack Drummond of London University said that after 130 poor children had been fed on the breakfast, effects had been \\"remarkable\\". The children had lost the poor skin conditions common at the time, and had enjoyed a 25% gain in height over those not having the breakfast. The worldwide popularity of the Oslo breakfast reached its peak around the mid-1950s, and then began to decline. In some areas it had been introduced as a supplementary meal to school lunch, not as a replacement as had originally been the case in Oslo. Schools found that running two meal programs reduced their teaching time, and chose to eliminate the breakfast rather than the more popular lunch. In the late 1950s the Oslo breakfast ceased to be provided in its home country: With Norway now much more prosperous, authorities saw no need to continue to provide any form of free school meal. Norwegian parents took over, providing a packed lunch with similar ingredients to the original breakfast. Other uses British food writer Marguerite Patten refers to the Oslo breakfast as a light alternative to the traditional cooked breakfast, in a 1955 book aimed at \\"brides and beginners\\". In this context it is a meal at home, resembling a savoury Continental breakfast.Learning to cook with Marguerite Patten.

He served as the first Communist Party Chief and the second Governor of Hebei province of the PRC, but was purged in 1966 at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. Communist revolution Lin Tie was born in November 1904 to an educated family in Wanxian, Sichuan province (now Wanzhou District, Chongqing). Born Liu Shude (ÂàòÊ†ëÂæ∑), he also used the pseudonyms Li Te (ÊùéÁâπ) and Zhao Fu (ËµµÁ¶è). Lin entered Wanxian Middle School in 1918 and then Chongqing United High School in 1922, where he was influenced by the Communist youth leaders Yun Daiying and Xiao Chun√º (ËêßÊ•öÂ•≥). After graduating from high school in 1925, Lin went to Beijing and attended China University, Sino-Russian University, and the University of Law and Politics (all defunct). In November 1925 he joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) at the University of Law and Politics. In Spring 1928 Lin was dispatched by the CPC to Paris, France, where he enrolled at the University of Paris. He continued to participate in revolutionary and union activities, and was soon deported by the French government. He left for Belgium but was again deported by that country. In January 1932 he was sent to the Soviet Union to study at the International Lenin School and later the Communist University of the Toilers of the East, two Communist cadre training schools in Moscow. He returned to China in late 1935. During the Second Sino- Japanese War Lin Tie stayed in the Beijing-Tianjin area and helped establish the Hebei Communist Party Committee in 1937. During the subsequent Chinese Civil War Lin was the Party Chief of Central Hebei and the Political Commissar of the Central Hebei Military Region. People's Republic of China After the Communists defeated the Kuomintang in the Pingjin Campaign, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party was established on 12 July 1949, and Lin Tie was appointed the provincial party chief. The People's Republic of China was soon established on 1 October. Lin later also assumed the post of Governor, the number two post in the government hierarchy, but Liu Zihou took over that position in April 1958. Liu was a proponent of class struggle and was praised by Chairman Mao Zedong. Lin Tie, on the other hand, was a proponent of modernization. In 1958, Lin successfully lobbied the central government to approve moving the Hebei provincial capital from the more agrarian Baoding to metropolitan Tianjin (now a direct-controlled municipality separate from Hebei). Lin wanted to utilize Tianjin's industry and educational resources to help modernize the rural areas, but his plans were derailed by Mao Zedong's disastrous Great Leap Forward. In May 1966, Mao Zedong purged Politburo member, Beijing party chief Peng Zhen and started the decade-long Cultural Revolution. As Lin Tie was associated with the political network of Peng Zhen, Governor Liu Zihou took the opportunity to make a bid for the top office of Hebei. Liu courted Li Xuefeng, party chief of North China which includes Hebei province, and denounced Lin Tie. Lin was stripped of all his positions and imprisoned in a military compound. Liu subsequently persecuted many war heroes including his own former associates, resulting in at least 33 deaths. By January 1967, the capital of Hebei had been moved back to Baoding from Tianjin. When Liu Zihou arrived in Baoding, he was attacked and detained by rebel Red Guards, which included supporters of Lin Tie. On January 29, the red guards of the August First faction paraded Liu on a truck for five hours, which was witnessed by a million people. On February 11, the 69th Army of the PLA commanded by General Xie Zhenhua jailed 1000 members of the August First red guards, and restored Liu Zihou to power. In 1967 Lin Tie's former subordinates in Hebei denounced Liu Shaoqi, the fallen president of China, as China's Khrushchev, and Lin Tie as Liu's agent in Hebei. Vice Governor Yang Lichen, Lin's former lieutenant, was persecuted to death. After the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976 and the rise to power of reformer Deng Xiaoping, Lin Tie was rehabilitated. In 1982 he was elected a member of the Central Advisory Commission. On 17 September 1989 Lin Tie died in Beijing, aged 84. Lin was a member of the eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

The battle resulted in an Allied victory over the occupying Japanese Army and the liberation of Cebu City.  Prelude  After launching their campaign to recapture the Philippines at Leyte in October 1944, the Allies followed up that victory by dispatching troops to Luzon in January 1945. A month later, General Douglas MacArthur, overall commander of Allied forces in the Pacific, began planning to take the rest of the Philippines. General Robert L. Eichelberger's Eighth Army was then tasked with conducting a series of amphibious landings in the southern Philippines on islands between Mindanao and Luzon, including Cebu. Prior to the war, Cebu had been the Philippines second-most important industrial center, and it offered the Allies a harbor for future operations. The island was garrisoned by a force of between 14,500 and 15,000 Japanese troops. These were situated mainly in Cebu City and on the central east coast. Drawn from the 35th Army, the majority of these troops were support troops who had been supporting the evacuation of Luzon, and who were formed into combat units. The main Japanese combat units were the 102nd Infantry Division, which consisted of the 78th Infantry Brigade headquarters and the 173d Independent Infantry Battalion, and 1st Division, consisting of the 1st, 49th and 57th Infantry Regiments, which were down to battalion strength due to earlier fighting on Luzon. There were also several naval garrison units on the island, including the 33rd Special Base Force and the 36th Guard Unit.  Battle  US troops land on Cebu on March 26, 1945 Following a preliminary bombardment, the battle began on March 26, 1945, when the Allies launched Operation Victor II. Staging out of Leyte, where they had conducted rehearsal landings two days earlier, a large flotilla of cruisers and destroyers from the Seventh Fleet Task Force 74 escorted the Cebu Attack Group to the island. Under the leadership of Major General William H. Arnold, the forces assigned to the operation consisted of the Americal Division's 132nd and 182nd Infantry Regiments, totaling about 5,000 men, were landed on Cebu island at Talisay Beach, southwest of Cebu City. The 182nd came ashore southwest of the city, while the 132nd landed at a wide gravel beach to the northeast opposite a palm grove. Meeting no Japanese opposition, the U.S. forces nevertheless suffered heavily from mines and booby traps as they crossed the beach. It was the first time in the Philippines campaign that U.S. troops had encountered such weapons. As further waves landed, engineers and infantry began clearing lanes through the mine fields. The Americal Division slowly forced its way off the beach and moved inland against only small pockets of Japanese resistance that were carrying out delaying actions. The main body stopped for the night about from Cebu City. Patrols were sent out and the following day, the Americal Division continued its advance towards Cebu City, tasked with securing the harbor and nearby airfield, Lahug Airfield, positioned northeast of the city. On March 28, more significant fighting broke out as the Americans captured the airfield, as well as Mactan Island in Cebu Harbor. Although the city had been officially liberated, Japanese forces remained in many parts, including the port area, and occupied several strongly defended positions in the hills to the city's north, where they came under the command of Major-General Takeo Manjome, who had previously commanded the 78th Infantry Brigade. At this time, Japanese resistance grew more determined and heavy fighting followed. Around 8,500 local Cebuano guerrilla and irregular forces, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel James M. Cushing took part . Units fought on the outskirts of Cebu, capturing Pari-an on March 29 and liberating T. Padilla on April 7. As Allied morale heightened and Japanese forces withdrew to the ports, the U.S. naval commander, Ferdinand Ernest Zuellig, directed naval bombardments on the ports, prompting the Japanese to withdraw to Fort San Pedro. Many did not make it and were trapped within Piers One and Two. Although the final operations around the ports were successful and forced many Japanese to surrender, the Japanese headquarters unit in charge of the area made a final stand near the border of Mandaue City. Led by Major Rijome Kawahara, after further fighting these forces were defeated, and after that the Allies gained control of the remaining areas of the city as Kawahara's remaining troops withdrew. Kawahara was killed while trying to cross the makeshift bridge towards Mandaue City. Reportedly, he was killed by a sniper after being incapacitated by mortar and tank fire. Kawahara was posthumously promoted to the rank of colonel. After the war, his body was returned to Japan where it was buried in Sapporo, the city of his birth.  Aftermath  During the final stages of the battle, the mountainous parts of Cebu were also bombed and cleared. A series of battles were subsequently fought during this time, the most famous of which is the Battle of Gochan Hill, fought over three days from March 29. Battling against a heavily entrenched force, the fighting proved costly for the 182d Infantry Regiment, with one company losing over 50 men killed when the Japanese blew up an ammunition dump, before the U.S. forces finally took the hill, having destroyed at least 85 pillboxes. Supported by naval gunfire, the Americal Division attempted to break through the Japanese line through a frontal assault, but their attempts resulted in slow progress, so plans were made to outflank them. In early April two battalions from the Americal Division's third regiment, the 164th, were dispatched to Cebu as reinforcements. These were moved in great secrecy around the Japanese lines and on 13 April, the Americans put in a two-pronged divisional level attack, which although initially checked, eventually forced the Japanese commander, Manjome, to withdraw further north into the mountains. Meanwhile, on April 20 the 164th Infantry's third battalion landed on the island of Bohol, and in concert with Filipino troops and guerillas began clearance operations, before being moved to Negros on April 20; they were subsequently joined by the regiment's other two battalions on 25 April. On Cebu, after a brief pause, the Allied forces began to follow up the retreating Japanese on April 20. Filipino troops and Cebuano guerillas continued harassment operations. The Americal Division ceased operations on June 20, when they withdrew to Cebu City to begin preparations for future operations. Meanwhile, the guerillas continued to keep pressure on the remaining Japanese. The entire Cebu campaign ended on July 2, after Camp 8 had fallen. The Americans subsequently developed a large logistics base on the island, Base 'S', which was intended to be used by three infantry divisions as a staging base for the proposed invasion of Japan. Around 5,550 Japanese were killed during the fighting, while the Americal Division lost 410 men killed and 1,700 wounded; a further 8,000 U.S. troops became sick during the battle. The Filipino forces under the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary lost about 3,600 killed and 6,200 wounded. About 8,500 Japanese were able to escape into Cebu's north, where they remained until the war ended in August.  Controversy  A number of controversies surround this battle. The most famous is why General Sosaku Suzuki, commander of the IJA 35th Army which was responsible for the forces on Cebu, was not in command of the Japanese troops in the city and where he was during the height of the battle. One theory that has developed is that during the liberation of the city on March 27, Suzuki had already fled to the hills and mountains of Cebu City, hoping to make a last stand against the invading joint US and Philippine forces, resulting in the Battle of Gochan Hill. His orders for the defense of the city are believed to have been formulated earlier and the plan was made was given to Kawahara who, at that time, was the highest-ranking Japanese officer in the city, was entrusted with defending the city to the last man standing. As the mountainous parts of Cebu were being cleared by Allied forces, so too were the city outposts and barangays. When Suzuki transferred to the IJA garrison in the Cadulawan-Tubod area around Minglanilla, after fleeing from the destroyed mountain camps, on April 8, 1945, he received a mail that Kawahara had been killed while defending the city, and that the whole city, its ports and the nearby barangays had been captured by the Allies. Because of this, he began planning his escape. On April 14, 1945, the Allies began an assault on the Japanese bases in the Cadulawan-Tubod area, as well the elimination of the defenses set up by the IJA in Pungtod, Calajo-an, and the Port of Tulay-Tungkop in what later became known as the \\"Battle of Minglanilla\\" and the \\"Defense of Calajo-an\\". Spearheaded by US troops from 'G' Company, 182nd Infantry Regiment and some local soldiers from the Philippine Commonwealth military and Cebuano guerrillas, the battle lasted for two days, clearing the IJA from Minglanilla. To care for the wounded, Allied forces set-up four wards, called Allied Service Stations and Mobile Allied Service hospitals, in the area and this is the reason why today there are barangays in Minglanilla named Poblacion Ward I to Ward 4. The first stronghold, Camp 7, was cleared on April 15, but the bastion, Camp 8, was not cleared until July 2, marking the liberation of the entire Cebu from the Japanese. By the time the battle was at its height on April 10, Suzuki fled south in an effort to avoid capture and rejoin the main part of his command on Mindanao, in the southern Philippines. On April 19, while sailing in a convoy of small ships, Suzuki was killed when the ship he was in was attacked by U.S. aircraft between Sumilon Island Sound and Santander Bay.

Raghunath Prasanna playing Tripura Bansuri in a concert Personal life and family Raghunath was born in 1913 in Varanasi in the state of Uttar Pradesh. He was married to Saraswati Devi. They had seven children. One of them is the flute and shehnai player Rajendra Prasanna, whose son Rishab, Rajesh and Ritesh play the bansuri. Career Raghunath Prasanna got his musical training from his father Gauri Shanker, a shehnai player, and from Dauji Mishra from Varanasi. He was the first person in the family to introduce the art of flute (tripura bansuri and Krishna bansuri) in the family tradition, known until then for shehnai playing. At an early age, Prasanna worked as a Staff Artiste at various All India Radio stations, including Lucknow, Allahabad and Ranchi. Afterwards, he attended Banaras Hindu University and eventually received a seat in the Song and Drama Division of the Government of India. Raghunath was also known for playing Tripura and Krishna bansuris. His techniques have been adopted by his younger brothers and disciples Vishnu and Bholanath Prasannas, his sons Rakesh and Rajendra Prasannas, Niranjan Prasad, and Bhanu and Ronu Majumdars.

It had a straight body, an open bell, and two keys. The instrument was first used in Alcidiane by Jean-Baptiste Lully in 1658 and in French ensembles known as the bandes de hautbois, in which it played the inner lines of polyphonic compositions. J.S. Bach employed it when a low-pitched oboe was needed to double the viola parts in several of his cantatas, but almost exclusively in movements of a jubilant or otherwise loud nature due to its having had a more piercing sound than that of the cor anglais. Today, the instrument is rare outside period ensembles, and a cor anglais is commonly substituted. However, the period-instrument movement has seen a revival of the taille, with a number of makers now producing reproductio ns of classic examples. The term was also later applied to any instrument that played the tenor part in an orchestra, eg the tenor viol or viola.

The main aim is to fight against deterioration of public places. Crowdfixing actions include cleaning flashmobs, mowing, repairing structures, removing unsafe elements etc.  History   Placemaking  Placemaking, a concept originated in the 1960s that focused on planning, management and design of public places, was the philosophical background to the crowdfixing movement. According to placemaking, in the modern times all the resources needed to create community- friendly, enjoyable public spaces and keep them in good conditions are available, but decision-making processes exclude citizens' preferences.  Crowdfixing  Crowdfixing promotes the idea of public spaces as belonging to the local community, in opposition to the concept of areas merely administrated and owned by the State. Crowdfixing also tries to create better conditions for people to interact by providing them with online tools and mechanisms that allow them to set the different stages required to fix public spaces by improving the communication processes.

Name origin The name multi- channel network has only recently begun to be standard, coined by former YouTube employee Jed Simmons (reportedly because of YouTube's distaste for the notion of \\"networks\\"). Prior to 2014 many names were used by the different companies, including Online Video Studio (OVS), Internet Television Company (ITC), YouTube Network or simply Network. Sub-networks of MCNs are known as SubMCNs, Virtual Networks, Proprietary Networks, Content Distribution Networks, SMCNs, VNs, PNs, or CDNs. Purpose They work by a company setting up an account with YouTube CMS (the system used for ContentID), the company adds anyone who signs a contract with them to their CMS, allowing users (and the CMS account owner) to use monetization, block and track policies. Monetization allows for videos to generate revenue, Block prevents access to videos and Track allows content owners to see the analytics of 'reuploads' and copyright infringing content. Some MCN partners can block videos by country (e.g., if a video is uploaded with a banned or unlicensed logo). MCNs have been described as a means to \\"negate the hassle involved when seeking out your own advertising opportunities on the site.\\" Advertisers who work with MCNs can pay for services including overlay adverts, product placement and in show sponsorships, aiming to gain repeated exposure, endorsement by YouTube personalities, and increased audience engagement, especially compared with television advertisements which are often ignored or skipped.  Benefits  The benefits and drawbacks of partnering with a multi-channel network have been discussed by several high-profile YouTube creators, including Hank Green, Freddie Wong as well as YouTube itself. The possible benefits can include: * Access to video creation and publishing tools * Marketing and promotion * Access to production and editing facilities * Higher CPM * Access to traditional media projects and celebrities * Cover song and background music licenses on copyrighted music * Live events and merchandise  Controversies  There have been several controversies involving YouTube Networks. Machinima has been criticised for the use of perpetual contracts. Ben Vacas, known to the YouTube community as \\"Braindeadly\\", attracted media attention in January 2013 over contractual issues with Machinima. Under the terms of his contract, Machinima were permitted to place advertisements on Vacas's videos and in return he would receive a percentage of the profits generated. However, the contract also disclosed that it existed \\"in perpetuity\\"; meaning Machinima would hold the rights to any content created by Vacas published on his partnered YouTube channel in his lifetime, a detail Vacas failed to read. Machinima was criticised in early 2013 by high-profile YouTuber Athene for \\"intimidating... multiple partners\\" to sign a contract that would significantly lower their CPM. Athene called it \\"one of the worst deals on the internet\\" and advised his subscribers not to \\"sign with Machinima\\" stating that they could get a better arrangement with other networks. Purchases Several MCNs have been purchased by larger corporations. In early 2014 Maker Studios was sold to Disney for $500 million, and Big Frame was sold to DreamWorks Animation through AwesomenessTV for $15 million. In June 2013, RTL Group invested $36 million in BroadbandTV Corp.

He was the son of John Smale.Obituary, London and China Telegraph, 16 August 1882, p10 He studied in Manchester and the Inner Temple. He was admitted by the Inner Temple in 1828 but then qualified and practised as a solicitor. He was called to the bar of the Inner Temple in 1842. He practised at the Chancery Bar for eleven years from 1846 to 1857 and was noted as a law reporter, being one of the joint authors of \\"De Gex and Smale\\" (Reports of Cases decided in the High Court of Chancery, by Knight-Bruce, V.C., and Parker, V.C., 1849‚Äì1853, 5 vols., with John Peter De Gex), and \\"Smale and Gifford\\".Obituary, London and China Telegraph, 16 August 1882, p10 and Inner Temple Admission Database Legal appointments In 1860 he was appointed Attorney General of Hong Kong. He arrived in Hong Kong Kong on 22 April 1861. On 14 June 1861, he was appointed as a member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council. As Attorney General he was allowed to maintain a private practice and practised with much success.Norton-Kyshe, History of the Laws and Courts of Hong Kong, Vol II pp17-18 and pp 358‚Äì359 On 24 October 1866, he was appointed as Chief Justice of Hong Kong replacing William Henry Adams who had died in office. He served as Chief Justice until his retirement in 1881. Hawaiian King Kalakaua visits Hong Kong in 1881. Smale is standing behind Governor Hennessy As Chief Justice he was described as \\"somewhat lacking in the qualities necessary to maintain the dignity of his high office.\\" He was said to be \\"naturally of a temperament singularly impulsive and energetic and never succeeded in sinking the man and his natural propensities in the Judge; the consequence was that from time to time objectionable and occasionally disgraceful scenes were presented in court.\\"Norton Kyshe, History of the Laws of Hong Kong, Vol II, pp358-359 The best example of this was the case of Pollard v The Chief Justice of Hong Kong where the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council overturned a finding of contempt Smale had made against Edward Pollard QC on the basis that Smale had not told Pollard what the alleged contempts were before convicting him.Norton Kyshe, History of the Laws of Hong Kong, Vol II, Chapter LI and L.R. 2 P. C. App 106. Smale was knighted in 1874.London Gazette, 17 March 1874, p1692 Important issues As Attorney General, Smale was instrumental in bringing about the de-amalgamation of the solicitors' and barristers' professions in Hong Kong. Until his arrival solicitors and barristers had been able to practise without restrictions. Wigs had also not been worn in court. Smale in his first appearance in court wore a wig. Subsequently, he worked for the repeal of the Amalgamation Ordinance that had allowed barristers and solicitors to practise in any capacity. As Chief Justice when admitting barristers he would remind them that they were to act only as barrister. An example can be found in Nicholas John Hannen's admission in 1868.Norton Kyshe, History of the Laws of Hong Kong, Vol II, pp17-18,p41 and p141. Smale was strongly against slavery. In 1871, Kwok A Sing, a coolie on board a French ship the Nouvelle Penelope which had sailed from Macau killed the master and took over the ship landing in Pakha in China where the ship was abandoned. Kwok was arrested in Hong Kong to be extradited to China. Kwok made a habeas corpus application seeking his release. Smale ordered his release on the basis that the Nouvelle Penelope was a slave ship and Kwok was entitled to take any necessary steps to secure his freedom. Julian Pauncefote, the Attorney General of Hong Kong, then had him re-arrested to be tried for piracy. Smale again ordered his release on the basis the second arrest breached the first habeas corpus order. Kwok then sued Pauncefote for damages for false imprisonment under the Habeas Corpus Act. Kwok almost won with the British jury finding 4‚Äì3 in Kwok's favour, just one shy of the required majority of five. Smale's first decision was upheld by the Privy Council.Re Kwok A Sing (No.1) [2001] 3 HKC 710 and Re Kwok A Sing (No.2) [2001] 3 HKC 737.

The City of Mirrors was released for publication on May 24, 2016 by Ballantine Books. The film rights to the three novels were acquired in 2007 for adaptation into a film trilogy, but after 12 years of development and planning, it has been changed to a television series, premiering in January 2019. The City of Mirrors picks up where The Twelve left off, following the destruction of the Twelve and their viral followers, and explores the background of Subject Zero, the first human to be changed in the early 21st century. It delves into lengthy flashbacks, and also jumps 900 years into the future to reveal humanity's fate. Plot Alicia Donadio's child, the result of her rape in The Twelve, is stillborn. She forces herself out of her stupor and decides to hunt down Zero. Michael Fisher sails around the continent looking for the storied mines that were placed to keep the viral contamination at bay. He learns the virus has spread to the rest of the world, and realizes that the mines do not exist, and neither does the rest of the world; human civilization was completely wiped out by a mutated version of the virus. He finds an ocean liner beached in the Gulf of Mexico, and determines to fix it and sail to a safe island to save some portion of humanity. Lucius Greer has been keeping Amy and Carter alive in the cargo hold of their own ship by bringing them blood to feed on. Amy has no control over herself as a viral while Carter seems to be able to control his impulses. Peter Jaxon is raising his nephew Caleb in Kerrvile, the capital of the Republic of Texas. In his dreams, he lives with a human Amy, though he has not actually seen her in years. He accepts a request from the newly elected president of the Republic of Texas to join her administration, leading an initiative to open the town's security gates, since the virals have not been seen for years, allowing humanity to branch out. Alicia finds Zero in New York City, but learns he is her infector, thus she can not kill him. He befriends her and reveals he was originally Tim Fanning, who had a crush on Jonas Lear's girlfriend Liz during college. Later in life, when Jonas' science pulled him away from home in search of a cure for Liz's cancer, Liz and Tim had a brief tryst, though she turned down his request to stay with him. After Liz died, Tim eventually joined Jonas in his research to find a solution to humanity's challenge (resulting in Amy). The rest of his story is chronicled in the beginning of The Passage where Tim becomes the only one to survive infection, and thus becomes the first viral; Subject Zero. He reveals how almost drowning was what reverted him to human form, but retains everything else bestowed on him by the virus. Michael has worked for twenty years to rebuild the ship. Peter is now President of Texas, but finds that the human colonies have been able to spread so far that this may be the last presidency. Alicia, having lived with Zero for a few years, learns of his plan to kill the remaining humans in his quest to destroy Amy. Alicia leaves to warn her friends, while Zero sends his Many (infected virals) towards Texas in a plan to draw Amy out of hiding. The Many kill/convert the outer colonies, finally converging on Kerrville. Amy is restored to human form by Peter with the help of Alicia's knowledge of water. Carter transfers his Many over to Amy to assist in defending Kerrville. Zero's army prevails, leaving only 700 human survivors when the morning sun drives the virals off. Peter and Michael lead the people to the ship, arriving on the coast at dusk. Zero's Many attack, but Carter sacrifices his life to help Amy and the rest achieve the safety of the ship. Virals Alicia and Amy are joined by Peter and Michael, leaving the ship to find and kill Zero in order to end the plague. Peter is bitten by Zero, but his love for Amy prevents him from killing her at Zero's command. Zero is killed by Amy, who saves Peter with her own blood before he is destroyed along with the rest of Zero's Many. A near drowning has removed all traces of the virus from Alicia, who then decides to jump to her death. Michael takes a ship to England. Virals Amy and Peter live together, until he dies of old age after a couple of hundred years. The Kerrville survivors sail to the safe island, becoming the cradle for humanity. After 1000 years (Which is said to be the minimum required time for the virals to die off on their own in case they would not be stopped), their descendants return to North America. They find an ancient Amy, who tells them her story.

It began in 1278, as part of the Johannishospital (St. John's Hospital) in Leipzig, a leper hospital. It was later attached to the Johanniskirche (St. John's Church), which was destroyed in World War II. In 1536 it became the common burial ground for the city of Leipzig, and expanded several times. It was also re-modeled in the style of the Camposanto in Pisa, a popular style of cemetery in Germany. In 1680 and 1805 the graveyard was expanded by the additions of sections three and four respectively, then the fifth and the final extension took place between 1827 and 1863. 1883 saw its last burial. In 1981 the graveyard was closed and comprehensively cleared. 58 monuments and gravestones from the former Neuer Johannisfriedhof, which had similarly been cleared and re-developed as the present Friedenspark, were set up in the south-eastern corner of the Alter Johannisfriedhof. Since 1995 the former burial ground has again been accessible to the public, and is a protected monument as a museum and park.  History  The burial ground was in existence as early as 1278 on the land of the Johannishospital (St. John's Hospital) in Leipzig, a leper hospital. It was later attached to the Johanniskirche (St. John's Church), built in the 14th century and destroyed in World War II. At first the burials were mostly of those who died of leprosy. In 1476 the burial ground was enlarged, after the order of the Prince-Elector that inhabitants of Leipzig without citizenship should also be buried there. In 1536 George, Duke of Saxony, ordered that it should become the common burial ground for the city of Leipzig. Consequently, the first and second sections were both expanded several times. At the same time it was re-modelled in the style of the Camposanto in Pisa, a popular style of cemetery in Germany. In 1680 and 1805 the graveyard was expanded by the additions of sections three and four respectively. When this additional space was also full, the final extension, in the form of the fifth section, took place between 1827 and 1863. By 1846, however, it was clear that further extension was impossible, and a new cemetery, the Neuer Johannisfriedhof, was opened on a different site. During its history the burial ground was involved in military events on several occasions. During the Thirty Years' War Swedish troops camped here and partly destroyed it. In September 1813 it was used as a camp for prisoners and the wounded when the military hospitals in the city were full up. Soldiers lived in the vaults and used the coffins for firewood. In the fourth section are unmarked mass graves for victims of the Seven Years' War and of the Battle of Leipzig. In 1883 the first and second sections were re-planned and converted to a park layout, during which process the only tomb to remain untouched was that of Christian F√ºrchtegott Gellert. On Christmas Eve of the same year the burial of a Dr. Emil Breiter brought to an end the graveyard's more than 600 years of use for burials. Between 1484 and 1834 257,275 burials are recorded. The burials were mostly of Germans, but Swiss and French people, Russians, Italians, English people and Americans were also buried here. When the nave of the Johanniskirche of 1585 was replaced by a larger building in October 1894, the bones of Johann Sebastian Bach were discovered, which had been buried in the graveyard on 31 July 1750. The bones of Bach and of Gellert were placed in 1900 in a vault beneath the altar of the church. Between 1925 and 1929 on a site covering most of the former first section, all of the second section and the site of the former hospital, the new Grassi Museum was built. As the 20th century progressed the burial ground lost its fifth section as a result of the widening of the neighbouring streets and the construction of the Gutenberg School. Many monuments and gravestones were thus displaced. Of the many vault buildings still extant in the 1920s only that of the Baumg√§rtner family has been kept. On 4 December 1943 the Johanniskirche was destroyed during an air raid. It was only possible to save and reinforce the tower, but it was blown up in 1963. In 1981 the graveyard was closed and over the next fourteen years comprehensively cleared. In 1991 58 monuments and gravestones from the former Neuer Johannisfriedhof, which had similarly been cleared and re-developed as the present Friedenspark, were set up in the south-eastern corner of the Alter Johannisfriedhof. Since 1995 the former burial ground has again been accessible to the public, and is a protected monument as a museum and park.

Graph kernels can be intuitively understood as functions measuring the similarity of pairs of graphs. They allow kernelized learning algorithms such as support vector machines to work directly on graphs, without having to do feature extraction to transform them to fixed-length, real-valued feature vectors. They find applications in bioinformatics, in chemoinformatics (as a type of molecule kernels), and in social network analysis. Concepts of graph kernels have been around since the 1999, when D. Haussler introduced convolutional kernels on discrete structures. The term graph kernels was more officially coined in 2002 by R. I. Kondor and John Lafferty as kernels on graphs, i.e. similarity functions between the nodes of a single graph, with the World Wide Web hyperlink graph as a suggested application. In 2003, Gaertner et al. and Kashima et al. defined kernels between graphs. In 2010, Vishwanathan et al. gave their unified framework. In 2018, Ghosh et al. described the history of graph kernels and their evolution over two decades. Applications The marginalized graph kernel has been shown to allow accurate predictions of the atomization energy of small organic molecules. Example Kernels An example of a kernel between graphs is the random walk kernel, which conceptually performs random walks on two graphs simultaneously, then counts the number of paths that were produced by both walks. This is equivalent to doing random walks on the direct product of the pair of graphs, and from this, a kernel can be derived that can be efficiently computed. Another examples is the Weisfeiler-Leman graph kernelShervashidze, Nino, et al. \\"Weisfeiler-lehman graph kernels.\\" Journal of Machine Learning Research 12.9 (2011). which computes multiple rounds of the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm and then computes the similarity of two graphs as the inner product of the histogram vectors of both graphs. In those histogram vectors the kernel collects the number of times a color occurs in the graph in every iteration. For two isomorphic graphs, the kernel returns a maximal similarity since the two feature vectors are identical. Note that the Weisfeiler-Leman kernel in theory has an infinite dimension as the number of possible colors assigned by the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm is infinite. By restricting to the colors that occur in both graphs, the computation is still feasible.

Three were ordered by Japan but lost at sea during delivery. Design and development The Hanriot HD.15 was designed in response to a government call for a turbo-supercharged high altitude fighter-reconnaissance aircraft. It was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 8Fb 8-cylinder upright water-cooled V-8 engine fitted with a Rateau turbo-supercharger intended to maintain sea level powers to altitudes up to . Structurally the HD.15 was an all-metal aircraft, though the flying surfaces and rear fuselage were fabric covered. The wings had rectangular section Duralumin box spars, assisted by tubular auxiliary spars forward and aft of them. In plan they were straight edged, unswept and of constant chord and thickness. The lower wing had a slightly greater span. The wing tips were essentially square, except that the horn balances of the short span ailerons on both upper and lower wings projected beyond. There was no stagger. The HD.15 had unusual interplane struts: instead of the familiar division of the wing into bays by struts braced with crossed flying and landing wires, it had a rigid, spanwise, X-shaped strut on each side, linking the upper and lower spars. Vertical wires maintained the interplane gap and the location of the crossing point, which was below mid-gap. The inboard end of each upper X-strut met the wing at the top of the aft member of a pair of cabane struts. The lower ends of the X-strut met the wing further outboard, at the bottom of a strut that ran to the upper fuselage longeron. The empennage of the HD.15 was like those used on earlier Emile Dupont designs, with a braced, rectangular tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage and a small, curved edged fin. Both carried balanced control surfaces, the elevator's balances projecting beyond the tailplane tips, and the low but broad chord, curved edge, deep rudder reaching down to the keel and moving within an elevator cut-out. The rather tubby fuselage of the HD.15 had tubular cross- section longerons with similar, triangularly arranged, cross bracing. The pilot's open cockpit was just behind the main wing spar, under a deep trailing edge cut-out to improve his upwards and forward vision. Close behind was the observer's cockpit, fitted with a mounted pair of swivelling machine guns. The fuselage was fabric covered from the pilot's cockpit aft. The Hispano engine, enclosed under a metal cowling, was cooled with a pair of circular cross- section radiators mounted ventrally between the undercarriage legs. The HD.15 had a fixed conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels on a single axle mounted on the lower fuselage longerons by two pairs of V-struts. Operational history The HD.15 first flew in April 1922 and should have been in competition with the Gourdou-Leseurre GL.50, but the two seat reconnaissance fighter programme had been abandoned before this date. The whole high altitude fighter project, which also included single seaters, was dropped with the inability of Rateau to deliver reliable superchargers in quantity, essentially because of high temperature material problems. Nonetheless, the Japanese Army became interested in supercharger-engined fighters and in 1926 the prototype HD.15 was sold and delivered to them. An order for three more followed, but the ship taking them to Japan was sunk by a tidal wave en voyage.

It is dedicated to Sulpitius the Pious. The oldest material traces of a religious building on the site date back to the 10th century. Three churches preceding the current construction were identified during excavations carried out in 1967. The current building was built between 1750 and 1753 in a classical style, by an anonymous architect. The brick and limestone church is quite homogeneous. It's composed of six bayed naves flanked by aisles, a three-sided transept and a choir with a polygonal ambulatory with a sacristy in its axis. The chamfered base is in dimension stone on the frontage, in rubble stones and sandstone for the rest. All the angles of the building are toothed and every second stone is bossed. The church has been listed as a Belgian cultural heritage site since 1949.  Historical context  Both the church and Jumet itself were listed in 868 in the polyptych of Lobbes Abbey. Despite its age, it is rarely mentioned in records. Most of the relevant documents were probably lost in the destruction of the State Archives in Mons and of the episcopal archives of Tournai at the beginning of the Second World War. Before the French Revolution, Jumet was part of the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge; the abbot of Lobbes was sovereign lord by appointment of the Prince-bishop. However, its neighbouring states, Hainaut and Brabant, challenged Li√®ge's claim to Jumet. Over time, Brabant gained in influence, which seemed in accordance with the local population's wish. By the 1730s, Brabant was acting as if it completely owned Jumet. During the 1740s, Duchess Maria Theresa of Austria and the Council of Brabant instituted administrative reforms at the request of the mayor and the magistrate. On 28 June 1780, Prince-Bishop Fran√ßois-Charles de Velbr√ºck officially yielded the lordship of Jumet to Brabant. During the period of French rule, Jumet belonged to the department of Jemappes, which became part of the province of Hainaut after the fall of Napoleon. The church's predecessors, whose patron saint remains unknown, belonged to a parish of the old deanery of Fleurus, part of the diocese of Li√®ge. In 1559, during reforms of the episcopal hierarchy of the Low Countries, this parish was first assigned to the newly created diocese of Namur, and later to the diocese of Tournai in the Concordat of 1801.  The excavation of 1967  In 1967, the church underwent a major restoration led by , architect and professor at the University of Leuven. During this restoration, excavations were conducted by , assistant professor at the University of Leuven, from 16‚Äì22 August 1967. Layout of the August 1967 excavation These excavations were conducted in a limited area which turned out to be of significance. although the restoration work had already destroyed some of the ancient foundations. The construction of the current church had already profoundly modified the earlier site. The 18th-century flooring is lower than earlier levels; only the lowest levels of the old foundation still remained. During the excavations they found no foundation, no under-pavement, no lime mortar runoff, and no altar base. The sepulchre lay under the current flooring level only. The work done in the 19th and 20th centuries removed ancient traces. A thin brick gutter to hold gas lighting pipes was installed during the second half of the 19th century, cutting across the B trench. An early 20th-century gutter, constructed roughly along the lengthwise axis of the current church, cut through the old foundations. These surveys made it possible to correctly locate the building's successive stages of growth.  The successive churches  Three religious buildings that preceded the current church were uncovered during the excavations. Superimposed plans of churches 1, 3 and 4.  First church  Pre-Romanesque, the first building was formed of a rectangular chamber composed of a plain nave wide, whose length the excavations did not manage to determine. It is possible that as in other small churches of the early Middle Ages, the length of the church was double its width. This edifice may have been the church consecrated between 959 and 971 by Eraclus, abbot of Lobbes and bishop of Li√®ge, which was mentioned in the \\"Eraclus charter\\".  Second church  Superimposed plans of churches 2 and 3. During the excavation, the sole trace of the second church ‚Äî the foundation of an irregular three-sided apse‚Äî was found. How the building was constructed toward the narthex remains unclear. However, it is known that this side ended with a tower because Jehan Camal, the local priest, bequeathed 50 livres towards the repairing of the tower and the installation of a bell in his will of 1517. This tower is probably the same one mentioned in the 17th century, which was demolished for the construction of the 18th century church. The size of the choir/chancel suggests a three-apsed construction, maybe similar to the third church. As well as the main altar, a Pouill√© ecclesiastical register from 1445 mentioned an altar devoted to Saint Nicholas, and another from 1518 mentions an altar devoted to the Virgin Mary. Noting the similarities to the choir in Saint-Martin's church at Marcinelle, rebuilt at the end of the 15th century, Luc-Francis Genicot hypothesised that it took inspiration from Jumet's earlier design, possibly from the 14th century. In the choir lies a burial place containing a skeleton in a nailed oak coffin. The presence of embroidered cloth and the location suggests that it is the tomb of a priest, probably the local parson.  Third church  Foundations of previous buildings The chancel of the third edifice probably dates back to the middle of the 17th century. This church is eight times bigger than the first. The chancel is of a pentagonal design deep. It is consolidated by four buttresses, suggesting that it was once covered by a solid vault, probably of gothic design. The nave, long and of an estimated width of , is slightly trapezium- shapedConsidering that the restitution is correct, because the south-west angle hasn't been maintained . and has two aisles. The scale of the aisles lets us imagine a building of the hall church type, like many that existed in Hainault in the 15th and 16th century. The tower stands against the church frontage. It underwent an important restoration in 1670 and a clock was installed in 1681. This bell-tower was probably square and roughly long on each side. It was capped by an octagonal pointed spire, topped by a big finial cross and a weathercock reaching to high. In 1710, the state of the church again called for serious repairs, and Jumet's bailiff, Jean de Vigneron, asked the abbot of Lobbes, a big tithe collector, to build a new church. The abbey could not meet the expense. Finally, after a lawsuit, an agreement was reached for the repairs to the church including the choir, the tower and the roof of the nave.  Present church  Section and elevation of the first draft of the 18th century with the old tower held (sheet E). The present church was built between 1750 and 1753 by an anonymous architect. The original plans consist of five coloured sheets.Kept at State Archives in Belgium They have been numbered from A to E without any obvious order, probably after the completion of the construction. The C sheet did not belong to the first file, but the five drawings are from the same author. The E sheet has notes on the back where the name of D. De Lados appears twice, suggesting that it could be the name of the architect. Before 1750, the old church was demolished and the ground leveled. This leveling is probably why the present church isn't correctly oriented, unlike the original church, whose choir faced due east. Details of materials reused in the current facing of the north facade. At the time, the design was considered ambitious and excessive for the locality. Tensions took place between the architect and the sponsors, including the abbot of Lobbes, Th√©odulphe Barnab√© (abbot from 1728 to 1752). Construction lagged and, even though old materials were re-used in the base and the pavements, the cost was five times the original estimate : The initial plan intended to re-integrate the old tower. An amendment definitely scrapped all the past. This project of a new tower probably belonged to that part of the many other things that were mentioned in the complaint. 18th century drawing of a proposed new facade (sheet C) This conflict ended with a trial before the Sovereign Council of Brabant. The architect was forced to reduce the scale of the project. This is evident by examining the successive frontage projects and comparing the size of the achieved high parts and the planned size on the original elevation drawing. The construction continued but with some delay. The church was finished in 1753. The steeple was designed to receive three bells. Two bells are attested, and there is no formal proof of the existence of the third. On the east side, a bell from 1590 is adorned with the image of the Virgin and has the inscription: Micael Willelmus coadiutor Lobiensis me fecitMichel Willame was co-helper from 1580 to 1598 of the abbey of Lobbes, Ermin Fran√ßois, he was elected himself in 1598 and died in 1600 . ‚Äì 1590 ‚Äì Ma√Ætre Jean Grongnart, founderJean Grongnart belongs to a dynasty of founders that worked in Hainaut during the 16th and 17th century . On the west side, the second bell was probably in bad shape because it was remelted in 1772, as the inscription attests : + In the year 1772 I was remelted at the expense of the community of Jumet by Simon Chevresson and Deforest. It's probable that the French revolution induced structural damage because a budget was allocated by the local administration for the repair of window panes and the roof in 1797. In 1808, three new altars were built. In 1835, the church underwent an important restoration. Part of the pavement was replaced, a new set of furniture was put in, the altars transformed and the master altar re- dedicated. In the brickwork of the master altar, removed during the 1968 restorations, a wooden reliquary casket with a glass lid was discovered. It contained two bones held together by a copper thread. Between them was a paper document in a very bad shape, nearly unreadable, dated 1835. Possibly that the reliquary is older than that and was put there when the altar was re- devoted.Photography of the reliquary on the website of the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage In 1840, a pipe organ was installed, the work of organ builder Hypolite Loret of Brussels. The instrument was upgraded in 1873. In 1943, German occupation authorities commandeered the bells. The 1590 bell was taken down and shipped to Germany. After the war, it was found and re- installed in the steeple.Photograph of the bell on the website of the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage  Architecture and furniture  Chevet of the church. The church is made of brick and limestone and was built in the classic style. Overall, it is uniform in appearance. It's composed of six bayed naves flanked on either side by aisles, a three-sided transept and a choir with a polygonal ambulatory with a sacristy in its axis. The chamfered base is in dimension stone on the frontage, in rubble stones and sandstone for the rest. All the angles of the building are toothed and every second stone is bossed. Exterior elevation of the first three bays of north aisle. The windows, except those of the tower, all have a gouged limestone frame cut with protruding teeth, with a curved arch and window aprons joined together by a limestone band going around the whole building. Similarly conceived half-windows are found on the second level in the background, under the cornice. The frontage has two levels, with above them a curved pediment. On the first level, two belts proceed further than the central part to the side frontages under the voluted ailerons placed on both sides of the second level. Above the pediment, a square tower is made up of two stories separated by a belt. The tower has a polygonal steeple on a pyramidal base. The limestone portal is preceded by several steps. It's flanked by pilasters with crosswalls that hold an entablature and a curved pediment. There is an arched door. A secondary door, preceded by ten steps, is pierced by the first north aisle bay. The interior is quite bright, painted in white and grey. It is covered by barrel vaults. The columns of the nave are of tuscan style. The piers of the choir and of the transept are crowned with a voluted capitals. The church contains noted panelling and furniture. In the church is a baptismal font from the 11th or 12th century. It consists of a stone bowl slightly flared but circular, flanked by four engaged columns on a base. The columns end with a roughly cut human head, of which two out of four are missing. The style is Romanesque and the font archaic: straight nose and barely cleared, skin-deep eyes, mouth expressionless. These details are characteristic of Romanesque workshops from the 11th and 12th centuries. However, the disposal of Jumet differs from other fonts known by the feature that the heads are borne directly by columns. Usually, the head is supported in cantilever by a kind of console, as is the case, for example, in Gerpinnes. The furniture also contains an altar devoted to Our-Lady of Tongre and a communion bench, both dating from the 17th century.

The site, 21 kilometres north-northwest of Kumluca, is overgrown with forest and hard to reach.\\"Idebessos Lycia, Turkey\\" in The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites Geography The city lies at an altitude of 1050 meters. Due to the nature of the terrain, the city was built in a north-south orientation and occupies approximately 360 by 160 meters. Larger public buildings and the necropolis were built on flatter areas in the west, while dwellings were mostly built on the sloping part of the terrain in the east. The eastern slope is widened by terrace walls at different elevations, which provided narrow corridors with primarily houses. History Except for a coin from the Classical period, which has been controversially attributed to the city, there is no evidence of the city's existence before the Hellenistic period. Idebessos was a member of the Lycian League from its foundation in 168 BC. Inscriptions mention that the city was a polis and a member of a sympoliteia with Akalissos and Kormos. The sympoliteia was led by Akalissos and represented by a single vote in the Lycian League during the Roman period. A Lycian town named Edebessus (·ºòŒ¥ŒµŒ≤Œ∑œÉœÉœåœÇ) is mentioned by the Lycian Capito in his Isaurica, an 8-volume history of Isauria.John Lempri√®re, A Classical Dictionary (1839)George Crabb, Universal Historical Dictionary, vol. 1 (1833) The Synecdemus lists Elebesus (·ºòŒªŒµŒ≤ŒµœÉœåœÇ), corrected to \\"Edebessus\\" (·ºòŒ¥ŒµŒ≤Œ∑œÉœÉœåœÇ) in Wesseling's 1735 edition, while Parthey's 1866 edition suggests that it may correspond to the ŒõŒµŒ≤ŒπœÉœÉœåœÇ or ŒõŒπŒ≤œÖœÉœÉœåœÇ (Lebissus or Libyssus) mentioned in the Notitiae Episcopatuum. A report on archaeological investigations in 2005 also presumed an identity of Idebessus with the bishopric town of Lebissos or Lemissos. However, the list of titular sees (formerly residential) that are recognized by the Catholic Church includes both Idebessus (identified with modern Kozaƒüacƒ±) and Lebessus (identified with modern Kayak√∂y) and describes each as a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Myra, the capital of the Roman province of Lycia.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), pp. 908 and 915 The city was still occupied in the Byzantine period, and it is not known when the city was deserted. Archaeological investigations T. A. B. Spratt identified the ruins of the city as the remains of Idebessos in 1842. In two days he surveyed the site and copied some inscriptions. Over time numerous other scholars visited the archaeological site for smaller investigations, but it was not until the 2000s that a detailed survey of all the remains was completed. Layout A main street entered the city to the west of the acropolis and then ran north. From the south to the north a Greek theater, a bath-gymnasium complex and a church are found along this road. The public center of the settlement is the area between the theater and the baths. A wide flat area between these buildings must have served as the agora. The necropolis extends uninterrupted along the main street and is most dense in the city's center, which is quite unusual. Normally necropoleis were located along the main roads leading to the city and end outside the settlement. The baths, theater, northern church and the necropolis have been reasonably well preserved, but most of the houses are damaged to a level that it is not possible to determine their layout. Acropolis The acropolis covers an area of 120 by 150 meters in the southeast of the settlement, rising approximately 10 meters above the city's center. The northern and western sides of the acropolis were protected with walls reinforced with three towers. The eastern and southern sides of the acropolis were naturally protected by steep rock faces and had a terrace wall. A heroon from the Roman period and a Byzantine church from the 5th or 6th century AD were built on the acropolis. In the Byzantine period the acropolis was transformed to a castrum with stronger fortifications. It encircled the church and was constructed with building material partially reused from the structures of the Roman period. It must have been built in the 7th or 8th century AD, when the region was subject to increasing Arab raids as a consequence of the Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars. Other structures The Greek theater dates to the Hellenistic period. It was built into the northwestern slope of the acropolis hill and has been estimated to seat a maximum of 364 people. The bath-gymnasium complex was most likely built no later than the 2nd century AD and consists of seven separate units and a palaestra. The baths were supplied with water from a stream to the north of the city by a small canal. The northern church is the largest church of the settlement, measuring about 15.30 by 28.15 meters and likely built in 5th or 6th century AD. A small triconch church is found south in the city, but is completely ruined. It was possibly built later than the two other churches. The necropolis counts 51 sarcophagi and four exedra-type tombs.

The project aims to collect weather data from the past 250 years by linking international meteorological organisations to support data recovery projects and the imaging and digitisation of historical meteorological observations made at, for example, inland stations, lighthouses, or by ships at sea or in ports. The project aims to create historical datasets that are spatially and temporally complete, so as to be of value at a local, or regional level, as well as on a global scale. ACRE aims to recover millions of historic weather observations. This data will be deposited into two databases, *ISPD - the International Surface Pressure Databank, *ICOADS - the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set. This data will also be used to build a global dataset of historical weather reconstructions based on a grid of two degrees of latitude by two of longitude at six hourly intervals, entitled the 20th Century Reanalysis, or 20CR. Version one of 20CR, covering 1891 to 2008, was released in Autumn 2009. Version two, covering 1871 to 2010, appeared in December 2011. Version 3, 20CRv3, going back to 1836, was published in October 2019. It is intended that all the data recovered and the 20CR will be made freely available.

The study, which was funded by the National Institute of Health, began in July, 1958, and was last updated as recent as May 2016. It resulted in more than 560 published papers that ultimately showed the importance of HDL cholesterol. The study was conducted by Dr. Curtis Gordon Hames, a family doctor from Claxton, Georgia. The study took place in Evans Country because the area had a high death count due to heart complications, such as heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases. The studies showed that there was a significant abundance of heart conditions within a variety of ethnicities. People as young as fourteen and as old as seventy-four participated in the tests, and were divided into different age groups; however only males were eligible for the study. Anyone as old as one- hundred years old could be eligible, and any younger.  Background  The study involved 6,596 people from Evans County and 3,921 people from Bulloch County. The study population from Evans county consisted of African-American and Caucasian males, ages 40‚Äì74, along with a 15-39 year old group that were involved in other studies. Then, the people were divided up into 10 random, equal in size, random samples. Also, a 50% random sample of the 15-39 year old group was taken by including people from the first five samples solely. By comprising this type of sampling, secular trends in disease patterns, along with possible aging of laboratory reagents were randomized. The study was done in Evans County, Georgia. Evans County is located in the southeastern portion of the United States. It is situated on the coastal plain estimating around 60 miles inland from the seaport of Savannah, GA. Around half of the population lives on farms while the other half lives in meager little villages. An example is Claxton. Claxton is a town that has a population of 2,000, about 40 percent of which is black. The white population of Evans County was large enough to provide an adequate number for the study, but the black population was considered too small and some blacks from the Bulloch county were incorporated into this study.  Goals and Methods  The study can be categorized as a cohort study due to the longevity of the research and its focus on the residents of Evans County, Georgia. It was the leader in the field of epidemiology to analyze effects and differences of coronary heart disease on race. The study aimed to determine how cardiovascular disease affected different races among a specific population. To determine the population size, a specific census was conducted in the county for the study during the first two months of 1960, recording 6,596 persons. From there, the study population included a total of 3,377 residents within Evans County. These residents included a group of randomly selected blacks and whites age 40-74 and an additional group of blacks were selected from Bulloch sub-County. A group of 15-39 year old residents were also selected into this group mainly to participate in other experiments as well. The study population was subsequently randomly divided into 10 groups. The examination process consisted of two cardiovascular tests including \\"history and physical, blood pressure determination, standard electrocardiogram and chest X-ray, and cholesterol determination.\\" Ninety-two percent of the study population responded with an examination process. Therefore, data from 3,102 residents was obtained through the process. Using a prospective cohort model, the investigators sought to examine the entire population of the county aged over 40 years and half the population aged between 15 and 39 years. They ultimately achieved a 92% response rate for a total study population of 3,102 residents. From 1960 to 1962, each participant was given an initial examination in which serum cholesterol, blood pressure, weight, height and the participant's responses to a number of health behavior and medical history questions. A follow-up consisting of a similar battery of tests was completed from 1967 to 1969. For 90.9% of the study population, a physical similar to the preliminary one was completed. For another 7.9%, health status was ascertained by a phone survey of either subject or a family member. The total rate of follow-up was 98.8%. Factors assessed at the time of follow-up were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, cigarette smoking, body weight, hematocrit value, ECG abnormalities and diet. Socioeconomic status was also assessed for whites, but not for blacks, as little variability was found in this factor among black subjects.Cassel, J., ed., 1971. Evans County cardiovascular and cerebrovascular study. Archives of internal medicine, 128 (6), 883-992.  Results/Conclusions  A central finding of the study was that, across race and social class differences, factors associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) did so equally for blacks and whites whether the risk factors were considered singly or in combination. CHD incidence remained markedly higher for white Evans County residents. The only social grouping of white residents that had equally low incidence of CHD was white sharecroppers, which was attributed to higher rates of physical activity among sharecroppers when compared to whites of higher socioeconomic status. A strength of the study was the high response rate of the population in its entirety, one of only two of its kind to successfully examine an entire community. The publication of the initial study results did not include statistical analysis. Hames attributes his decision to avoid statistical analysis to the unique design of the study. He wrote, ‚Äú‚Ä¶it certainly is not clear to us [the investigators] what differences such tests could make in our interpretations in the context of this study‚Ä¶ the population over 40 does not constitute a sample of some universe. They are a universe.‚Äù References Category:Evans County, Georgia Category:Health research Category:Heart Category:1958 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Evans County Heart Study"},{"id":"39419430","text":"A gauge tank locomotive made by Henschel and used in Togo, 1904. Rail transport in Togo began in 1905.  German colonial period  Lom√© station during the German colonial period. The basics of the rail network in Togo were laid during the German colonial period. The lines built in the then German Togo (Togoland) served mainly to facilitate the export of agricultural products. The long Lom√©‚ÄìAn√©ho railway was the first to be built in Togoland. It went into service in 1905. The used for that line set the standard for future Togo railway construction. On 27 January 1907, the birthday of Kaiser Wilhelm II, Togo's second railway, the long line from Lom√© to Kpalim√©, was opened. The protectorate's third line, between Lom√© and Atakpam√©, was constructed from 1908, and completed to its full length of in 1913. It branched off the Lom√©‚ÄìKpalim√© railway at a point from Lom√©, and was the only line in Togo to be extended during the subsequent French mandate. At the end of the German colonial period, Togo had a long rail network. Its rail vehicle fleet consisted of 18 tank locomotives, 20 passenger coaches and 202 goods wagons. As the rail network at that time was laid out in the shape of a star focused on Lom√©, its assets were able to be used very economically, with vehicle maintenance centralized at Lom√© in a main workshop. The operating personnel, including the mechanics, were mainly indigenous, and were predominantly Ewe people. The train drivers, however, were always German, and the operating language was German. The staff consisted of 768 locals and 26 Europeans. French mandate After World War I, Togo was divided between the United Kingdom and France, in the ratio of 1:2 . The entire rail network was in the part of the territory that was to be administered by France from then onwards, under a League of Nations mandate. During the post war period of military occupation, which lasted until 1922, the rail network was run under the name Togoland Military Railway (TMR). Train operation was in the hands of the neighboring railway of the Gold Coast, the Gold Coast Government Railways. For that reason, new rolling stock procured at that time was sourced mainly from the British Empire. Only after 1922 did the rail network receive its French language name: Chemins de fer du Togo (CFT). As Togo was \\"only\\" a mandated territory that had not permanently secured its international legal assignment to France, the French colonial authorities held back on making investments in Togolese railways. Only in the 1930s did France resume development of the railway network it had taken over from the Germans. In 1934, the long extension of the Lom√©‚ÄìAtakpam√© railway to Blitta was opened. However, the planned further extension to Sokod√© was abandoned due to lack of funds, even though its construction had already begun. In 1946, Togo became a United Nations Trust Territory. Simultaneously, the CFE procured new locomotives, which were the last steam engines to join the fleet. By 1964, trains on the network were being hauled solely by diesel locomotives. However, the old German colonial era coaches remained in use for passenger operations at least as late as the 1970s.

Under the influence of a variety of romantic commentaries about Togo's rail and colonial legends, a perception has developed that the newly independent Togo inherited a functioning rail network from the German colonial period, and that that network has since been ruined. Yet the truth is that at independence the Togolese rail vehicle fleet was obsolete. The newly independent Togo procured new passenger carrying railcars from Renault and de Dietrich, and a single railcar from Soul√©, as a reaction to the existing competition from road transport. Even so, as early as the 1960s there were proposals for the total abandonment of Togo's rail network. Since 1961, a long, private metre gauge line has served to link the phosphate mine at Hahotoe north of Lake Togo operated by Compagnie Togolaise des Mines du B√©nin (CTMB) until 2007, and by (SNPT) since then, to a jetty on the coast at Kp√©m√©. It is one of the two sub- networks that are still in operation today. In 1970, the station building at Lom√© station was rebuilt. The German colonial era goods and locomotive sheds, however, were left almost unchanged. The last expansion of the network occurred in 1971, with the opening of a new line to Tabligbo branching in an easterly direction off the Lom√©‚ÄìBlitta railway at Togbl√©kov√©. According to one source, that branch line is still in operation, but an earlier source claims that the branch was closed and lifted before the end of the 1970s. The branch was constructed to carry raw materials for cement production. As of about 1980, the railway network in Togo was operated by 20 diesel locomotives, ten railcars, sixty passenger cars and 375 wagons. At that time, approximately 1.5 million passengers and of freight were carried on the network annually. In 1985, the line from Lom√© to An√©ho was decommissioned east of the junction with the main line. In 1999, the Lom√©-Kpalim√© line, and the main line from Lom√© to Blita, including the Agbonou‚ÄìAtakpam√© branch, were closed from the point 19 km north of Lom√©. There have been conflicting reports as to the state of the remaining network since then.

Since this is a generalization of the univariate Behrens-Fisher problem, it inherits all of the difficulties that arise in the univariate problem. Notation and problem formulation Let X_{ij} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}_p(\\\\mu_i,\\\\, \\\\Sigma_i) \\\\ \\\\ (j=1,\\\\dots,n_i; \\\\ \\\\ i=1,2)\\\\ be independent random samples from two p-variate normal distributions with unknown mean vectors \\\\mu_i and unknown dispersion matrices \\\\Sigma_i. The index i refers to the first or second population, and the jth observation from the ith population is X_{ij}. The multivariate Behrens‚ÄìFisher problem is to test the null hypothesis H_0 that the means are equal versus the alternative H_1 of non-equality: : H_0 : \\\\mu_1 = \\\\mu_2 \\\\ \\\\ \\\\text{vs} \\\\ \\\\ H_1 : \\\\mu_1 eq \\\\mu_2. Define some statistics, which are used in the various attempts to solve the multivariate Behrens‚ÄìFisher problem, by : \\\\begin{align} \\\\bar{X_i} &= \\\\frac{1}{n_i} \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} X_{ij}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_i &= \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} (X_{ij} - \\\\bar{X_i})(X_{ij} - \\\\bar{X_i})', \\\\\\\\\\\\ S_i &= \\\\frac{1}{n_i - 1} A_i, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\tilde{S_i} &= \\\\frac{1}{n_i}S_i, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\tilde{S} &= \\\\tilde{S_1} + \\\\tilde{S_2}, \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\\\\\\\\\ T^2 & = (\\\\bar{X_1} - \\\\bar{X_2})'\\\\tilde{S}^{-1}(\\\\bar{X_1} - \\\\bar{X_2}). \\\\end{align} The sample means \\\\bar{X_i} and sum-of-squares matrices A_i are sufficient for the multivariate normal parameters \\\\mu_i, \\\\Sigma_i,\\\\ (i=1,2), so it suffices to perform inference be based on just these statistics. The distributions of \\\\bar{X_i} and A_i are independent and are, respectively, multivariate normal and Wishart: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\bar{X_i} &\\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}_p \\\\left(\\\\mu_i, \\\\Sigma_i/n_i \\\\right), \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_i &\\\\sim W_p(\\\\Sigma_i, n_i - 1). \\\\end{align} Background In the case where the dispersion matrices are equal, the distribution of the T^2 statistic is known to be an F distribution under the null and a noncentral F-distribution under the alternative. The main problem is that when the true values of the dispersion matrix are unknown, then under the null hypothesis the probability of rejecting H_0 via a T^2 test depends on the unknown dispersion matrices. In practice, this dependency harms inference when the dispersion matrices are far from each other or when the sample size is not large enough to estimate them accurately. Now, the mean vectors are independently and normally distributed, : \\\\bar{X_i} \\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}_p \\\\left(\\\\mu_i, \\\\Sigma_i/n_i \\\\right), but the sum A_1 + A_2 does not follow the Wishart distribution, which makes inference more difficult. Proposed solutions Proposed solutions are based on a few main strategies: * Compute statistics which mimick the T^2 statistic and which have an approximate F distribution with estimated degrees of freedom (df). * Use generalized p-values based on generalized test variables. * Use Roy's union-intersection principle Approaches using the T2 with approximate degrees of freedom Below, \\\\mathrm{tr} indicates the trace operator. =Yao (1965)= (as cited by ) : T^2 \\\\sim \\\\frac{ u p}{ u-p+1}F_{p, u-p+1}, where : \\\\begin{align} u &= \\\\left[ \\\\frac{1}{n_1} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\bar{X}_d'\\\\tilde{S}^{-1}\\\\tilde{S}_1 \\\\tilde{S}^{-1}\\\\bar{X_d}} {\\\\bar{X}_d'\\\\tilde{S}^{-1}\\\\bar{X}_d} \\\\right)^2 + \\\\frac{1}{n_2} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\bar{X}_{d}'\\\\tilde{S}^{-1}\\\\tilde{S}_2 \\\\tilde{S}^{-1}X_d^{-1}} {\\\\bar{X}_d'\\\\tilde{S}^{-1} \\\\bar{X}_d} \\\\right)^{2} \\\\right]^{-1}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\bar{X}_d & = \\\\bar{X}_{1}-\\\\bar{X}_2. \\\\end{align} =Johansen (1980)= (as cited by ) : T^2 \\\\sim q F_{p, u}, where : \\\\begin{align} q &= p + 2D - \\\\frac{6D}{p(p-1)+2}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ u &= \\\\frac{p(p+2)}{3D}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} and : \\\\begin{align} D = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_{i=1}^2 \\\\frac{1}{n_i} \\\\Bigg\\\\\\\\{ \\\\ & \\\\mathrm{tr}\\\\left[{\\\\left( I - (\\\\tilde{S}_1^{-1} + \\\\tilde{S}_2^{-1})^{-1} \\\\tilde{S}_i^{-1}\\\\right)}^2\\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {}+ {\\\\left[\\\\mathrm{tr}\\\\left(I -(\\\\tilde{S}_1^{-1} + \\\\tilde{S}_2^{-1})^{-1} \\\\tilde{S}_i^{-1}\\\\right)\\\\right]}^2 \\\\ \\\\Bigg\\\\\\\\}. \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} =Nel and Van der Merwe's (1986)= (as cited by ) : T^2 \\\\sim \\\\frac{ u p}{ u-p+1}F_{p, u-p+1}, where : u = \\\\frac{ \\\\mathrm{tr}(\\\\tilde{S}^2) + [\\\\mathrm{tr}(\\\\tilde{S})]^2} { \\\\frac{1}{n_1} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathrm{tr}(\\\\tilde{S_{1}}^2) + [\\\\mathrm{tr}(\\\\tilde{S_1})]^2\\\\right \\\\\\\\} + \\\\frac{1}{n_2} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathrm{tr}(\\\\tilde{S_2}^2) + [\\\\mathrm{tr}(\\\\tilde{S_{2}})]^2 \\\\right \\\\\\\\} }. =Comments on performance= Kim (1992) proposed a solution that is based on a variant of T^2. Although its power is high, the fact that it is not invariant makes it less attractive. Simulation studies by Subramaniam and Subramaniam (1973) show that the size of Yao's test is closer to the nominal level than that of James's. Christensen and Rencher (1997) performed numerical studies comparing several of these testing procedures and concluded that Kim and Nel and Van der Merwe's tests had the highest power. However, these two procedures are not invariant. =Krishnamoorthy and Yu (2004)= Krishnamoorthy and Yu (2004) proposed a procedure which adjusts in Nel and Var der Merwe (1986)'s approximate df for the denominator of T^2 under the null distribution to make it invariant. They show that the approximate degrees of freedom lies in the interval \\\\left[\\\\min\\\\\\\\{n_1-1,n_2-1\\\\\\\\},n_1+n_2-2\\\\right] to ensure that the degrees of freedom is not negative. They report numerical studies that indicate that their procedure is as powerful as Nel and Van der Merwe's test for smaller dimension, and more powerful for larger dimension. Overall, they claim that their procedure is the better than the invariant procedures of Yao (1965) and Johansen (1980). Therefore, Krishnamoorthy and Yu's (2004) procedure has the best known size and power as of 2004. The test statistic T^2 in Krishnmoorthy and Yu's procedure follows the distribution T^2 \\\\sim u pF_{p, u-p+1}/( u-p+1), where : u = \\\\frac{p+p^2} { \\\\frac{1}{n_1-1}\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathrm{tr}[(\\\\tilde{S}_1 \\\\tilde{S}^{-1})^2]+[\\\\mathrm{tr}(\\\\tilde{S}_1 \\\\tilde{S}^{-1})]^2\\\\\\\\} + \\\\frac{1}{n_2-1} \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathrm{tr}[(\\\\tilde{S}_2 \\\\tilde{S}^{-1})^2]+[\\\\mathrm{tr}(\\\\tilde{S}_2 \\\\tilde{S}^{-1})]^{2}\\\\\\\\} }.

These territories were to some degree economically inter-dependent, and it was suggested that an association would promote their rapid development. Its chairman was Lord Bledisloe. In 1939, the majority of the Commission recommended a union of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, whose African populations would remain under British trusteeship. It also proposed that there would be strong economic integration between these united territories and Southern Rhodesia, but ruled- out any political amalgamation involving Southern Rhodesia unless its overtly racial policies were changed and there was some form of representation of African interests in the legislatures of all three territories. A minority of the Commission appended a report which recommended the early amalgamation of the three territories, largely on economic grounds, despite the almost unanimous objections of Africans in all three. The Commission's recommendations were not put in place owing to the Second World War, but closer ties in Central Africa were developed during the war. After the war, the white minority administrations of Northern and of Southern Rhodesia renewed calls for a union, and in 1953 they achieved this in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Background to the Commission Developments in Central Africa Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia were administered until the 1920s by a Chartered company, the British South Africa Company under a Royal Charter dating from 1889.H. I Wetherell, (1979) Settler Expansionism in Central Africa: The Imperial Response of 1931 and Subsequent Implications, pp. 210‚Äì11 A Legislative Council for Southern Rhodesia was created in 1898, initially with a minority of elected seats and an electorate formed only of the better-off white settlers. However, the European franchise was extended: from 1914 there was an elected majority on the Legislative Council, and a campaign for self-government gained strength. As the British South Africa Company charter was due to expire in 1924, a referendum was held in Southern Rhodesia in 1922, when the electorate was given a choice between responsible government and entry into the Union of South Africa. Those in favour of responsible government won a significant, but not overwhelming, majority. When British South Africa Company rule in Northern Rhodesia came to an end in 1924, the territory became a protectorate, with a governor and Executive Council and Legislative Council, consisting of a majority of officials and a minority of unofficial members elected solely by European voters.E A Walter, (1963). The Cambridge History of the British Empire: South Africa, Rhodesia and the High Commission Territories, pp. 682‚Äì6, 690‚Äì1, 696‚Äì7. As early as 1915, the British South Africa Company proposed amalgamating Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia, but this was rejected by the Southern Rhodesian legislature in 1917, on the grounds that this might prevent Southern Rhodesia obtaining self- government.B Raftopoulos and A S Mlambo, editors (2009) Becoming Zimbabwe: A History from the Pre-colonial Period to 2008, p. 86. The option of amalgamation was again rejected in 1921 for the same reason. When the Southern Rhodesian electorate voted for self-determination in 1922, it could not have had any expectation of future amalgamation with Northern Rhodesia as Britain had not conceded the possibility of amalgamation to the Southern Rhodesian electorate to prevent it from voting to join the Union of South Africa. However, on a visit to Southern Rhodesia in 1927, the Conservative Colonial Secretary, Leo Amery gave Southern Rhodesia settlers the impression that he endorsed their claim to incorporate all or part of Northern Rhodesia.H. I Wetherell, (1979) Settler Expansionism in Central Africa: The Imperial Response of 1931 and Subsequent Implications, pp. 214‚Äì6, 225. At the end of the First World War, the European population of Northern Rhodesia was tiny, about 3,000 compared with ten times as many in Southern Rhodesia. This white population increased rapidly after the discovery of the Copperbelt in the 1920s, and Northern Rhodesian settlers wanted self-determination with a European minority electorate, following the model of Southern Rhodesia but separate from it. As long as Leo Amery was Colonial Secretary, he attempted to qualify the principle that the interests of Africans in tropical Africa would be treated as paramount, and gave tacit encouragement to these Northern Rhodesian settler aspirations. In the mid 1920s, Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia seemed to drifting apart. However, once the British government appeared to reject the idea of further white minority governments in Africa, talk of amalgamation resumed.H. I Wetherell, (1979) Settler Expansionism in Central Africa: The Imperial Response of 1931 and Subsequent Implications, pp. 216‚Äì7. British government reaction The British government appointed the Hilton Young Commission on the possible closer union of the British territories in East and Central Africa in 1927. Its majority view, when it reported in 1929, was that Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland should seek closer links with East Africa, although Sir Edward Hilton Young's minority report favoured linking these two territories with Southern Rhodesia on economic grounds. His minority report also suggested the partition of Northern Rhodesia, with its central area joining Southern Rhodesia: this was opposed by the British government. Even before the Commission's report was published, there were discussions between representatives of the settlers in Northern Rhodesia and the Southern Rhodesian government in 1928 on the terms of an amalgamation of the two Rhodesias. The Southern Rhodesia plan was for total union, with Northern Rhodesia becoming an undifferentiated part of a single colony. Northern Rhodesian settlers wanted minority rule, and were only prepared to join Southern Rhodesia if that were the only way to achieve this. Once Southern Rhodesian had secured self-government, it wanted union with Northern Rhodesia to strengthen its economy. It offered generous representation for Northern Rhodesian Europeans in a combined parliament, and guaranteed ministerial office in any combined government.C Leys and C Pratt, (1960) A New Deal in Central Africa, pp.4‚Äì5.H. I Wetherell, (1979) Settler Expansionism in Central Africa: The Imperial Response of 1931 and Subsequent Implications, pp. 215‚Äì6. The Colonial Secretary of the Labour Government, Lord Passfield, published his Memorandum on native policy in East Africa in June 1930. His statement of colonial policy was an emphatic reassertion of the principle of paramountcy of African interests. His Memorandum stated that no further white minority governments would be permitted, dismissing settler aspirations of self-government in Kenya and Northern Rhodesia. This turned Northern Rhodesian Europeans against association with East Africa and towards union with Southern Rhodesia. In 1933, a substantial minority in the Northern Rhodesian legislature favoured amalgamation with Southern Rhodesia, despite vigorous African opposition. This group was still in the minority, as a greater number of settlers were cautious about being marginalised by the much greater numbers of Europeans in the south, although even they had begun to accept that amalgamation was likely. The failure of the British government to build a rail link from Northern Rhodesia to Tanganyika, as envisaged in the Hilton Young report, made Northern Rhodesia's economy very dependent on Southern Rhodesian railways, and added economic to political reasons for a union.H. I Wetherell, (1979) Settler Expansionism in Central Africa: The Imperial Response of 1931 and Subsequent Implications, pp. 218, 225.B Raftopoulos and A S Mlambo, editors (2009) Becoming Zimbabwe: A History from the Pre-colonial Period to 2008, p. 87. Pressures towards amalgamation Northern Rhodesia's mining industry suffered a major downturn in the 1930s, which made the possibility of self-government even more remote. When representatives of both territories met in January 1936 at Victoria Falls, it was the Northern Rhodesians who pushed for amalgamation and representatives of the Southern Rhodesian Labour Party who blocked it, because Southern Rhodesian racial policies, including strict job reservation and segregation, could not be applied in the north owing to British government objections.C Leys and C Pratt, (1960) A New Deal in Central Africa, p. 9. In most of these discussions, Nyasaland was ignored, although the Governor of Nyasaland was involved in some of the discussions leading up to the Victoria Falls Conference.H. I Wetherell, (1979) Settler Expansionism in Central Africa: The Imperial Response of 1931 and Subsequent Implications, p. 223. The European community in Nyasaland was very small, about 1,750 in the 1930s. Until the mid-1930s, settlers there had no strong political ambitions and were not enthusiastic about a Central African Union which would be dominated by Europeans in Southern Rhodesia. In 1935, some European settlers formed a Greater Rhodesia League in Nyasaland, which favoured amalgamation with the Rhodesias as a way of establishing a regime of prosperity and security. However, in their memorandum to the Bledisloe Commission, the major settlers' organisations in Nyasaland proposed only an eventual amalgamation, because of fears that the Southern Rhodesian white community, whose economic interests conflicted with those of Nyasaland, would become dominant in a Central Africa union.R Tangri, (1971). Colonial and Settler Pressures and the African Move to the Politics of Representation and Union in Nyasaland, pp. 296‚Äì8. Despite differences in emphasis between the different territories, Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey, the Cabinet Secretary, who visited southern Africa in 1934, considered that the prevailing attitude among European settlers there was that they intended to keep power for as long as possible.M Chanock, (1977). Unconsummated union: Britain, Rhodesia and South Africa, 1900‚Äì45, pp. 223‚Äì4. In 1937, a Commission of Inquiry was appointed following a Southern Rhodesian proposal for amalgamation with Northern Rhodesia. The Commission noted the different constitutional arrangements between Southern Rhodesia, which had internal self-government and a Legislative Council that included elected members and Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, under Colonial Office regulation with advisory Legislative Councils composed of officials and nominees. It did however recommend the setting up of an Inter-Territorial Council consisting of the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia and the governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.B Raftopoulos and A S Mlambo, editors (2009) Becoming Zimbabwe: A History from the Pre-colonial Period to 2008, p. 88. The Bledisloe Commission Formation and hearings Under pressure from Europeans in both Northern and Southern Rhodesia, particularly from Godfrey Huggins, who had been the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia since 1933, the British government agreed in 1937 to set up a Royal Commission. The chairman was Lord Bledisloe, a former Governor-General of New Zealand. The other five Commissioners were Patrick Ashley Cooper, (later Sir Patrick) a governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, two Commissioners who had had experience of Colonial service, one MP who was also a lawyer and another who had considerable experience in mining and its labour policy. Its terms if reference were to consider a possible closer association between the two Rhodesias and Nyasaland.C Leys and C Pratt, (1960) A New Deal in Central Africa, pp. 9‚Äì10. The Commission took evidence from Europeans in all three territories, but from Africans only in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and not in Southern Rhodesia. Opposition to union within Southern Rhodesia came not only from the Native Associations, representing the more educated and politically aware Africans, but also the Native Authorities, the traditional tribal chiefs. This united opposition to amalgamation impressed the Commissioners. When they visited Nyasaland in 1939, a wide range of Nyasaland Africans, many of whom had worked in Southern Rhodesia and experienced its racial policies, expressed their total objection to any form of amalgamation.J McCracken, (2012) A History of Malawi: 1859‚Äì1966, p. 233, 236. A similar level of opposition was found in Northern Rhodesia when the Commissioners visited in 1938, with this opposition being led by the traditional leaders, who wished to keep the safeguard of British trusteeship against race-based Southern Rhodesian labour and land policies.H S Meebelo, (1971). Reaction to Colonialism: A Prelude to the Politics of Independence in Northern Zambia 1893‚Äì1939, pp. 265, 268‚Äì9. It drew attention to the small number of Europeans in Northern Rhodesia, and the even smaller number in Nyasaland. African interests in the two northern territories had therefore to be protected against Southern Rhodesian racial discrimination.A Okoth, (2006). A History of Africa: African nationalism and the de-colonisation process, p. 101. J McCracken, (2012) A History of Malawi: 1859‚Äì1966, p. 233. Main recommendations The Commission cautioned against over-emphasising conflicts of interest between black and white in Central Africa, and suggested that Africans could benefit socially and economically from European enterprise. However, it suggested that two major changes would be necessary to appease opposition to amalgamation from Africans north of the Zambezi. Firstly, the Southern Rhodesian pass laws and other overtly racial policies would have to be changed, Secondly, there should be some form of representation of African interests in the legislatures of each territory, possibly through the nomination of European representatives.M Chanock, (1977). Unconsummated union: Britain, Rhodesia and South Africa, 1900‚Äì45, p. 229. The Commission considered the complete amalgamation of the three territories. It thought that a looser form of federal union would make it more difficult to plan the future development of Central Africa as a whole. It also commented unfavourably on an alternative under which the eastern part of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland would remain as separate entities outside the union, as they would not benefit from the economy of the Copperbelt. Even though the Commission advocated future amalgamation, a majority of its members ruled this option out as an immediate possibility, because of legitimate African concerns and objections. This majority favoured an early union of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland into one unit which would co-operate economically with Southern Rhodesia as a possible first step to uniting all three territories later. Two leading Commissioners, Lord Bledisloe and Patrick (later Sir Patrick) Ashley Cooper, favoured complete and early amalgamation and wrote their minority report accordingly, despite contrary advice from Colonial Office permanent officials.M Chanock, (1977). Unconsummated union: Britain, Rhodesia and South Africa, 1900‚Äì45, p. 230.B Raftopoulos and A S Mlambo, editors (2009) Becoming Zimbabwe: A History from the Pre-colonial Period to 2008, pp. 87‚Äì8. Later events During the Second World War, co-operation between the three territories increased with a joint secretariat in 1941 and an advisory Central African Council in 1945, made up of the three governors and one leading European politician from each territory. After the war, the Labour Party Colonial Secretary from 1946 to 1950, Arthur Creech Jones, was reluctant to discuss any plans for amalgamation with Huggins, the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia because of opposition from Africans and within his own party. He did not entirely rule out federation, which had been proposed by a conference held at Victoria Falls in 1949 between the Southern Rhodesian government, and the elected, or \\"unofficial\\" members of the Northern Rhodesia Legislative Council led by Roy Welensky, without any Africans present. It was left to his successor in post in 1950 to 1951, James Griffiths, to begin exploratory talks with Huggins and Welensky representing the white minorities of both Rhodesian governments, subject to the opinion of the majority African populations being ascertained. After a change in the British government in 1951, the incoming Conservative Colonial Secretary, Oliver Lyttelton removed the condition of sounding out African opinion in November 1951, and pushed through the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland against strong opposition in 1953.E Windrich, (1975).

II, 102. After Napoleon took over the Maltese islands in 1798, Montebello took an active part in the resistance of the Maltese against the French around his home-town at ≈ªejtun. Afterwards, when the French Napoleonic forces had been ousted, and the British set up a provisional government in Malta, he was the first to be appointed to the Chair of Philosophy at the University of Malta. He held the office for almost four years, mainly teaching logic and metaphysics. He relinquished the Chair because he was appointed parish priest of Bormla, the last to hold the office under this title because subsequently the parish was promoted to a Collegiate led by Archpriests. He held the office of parish priest for only five years due to his premature death at the age of 46.No portrait or contemporary image of Montebello seems to exist. Life Birth and formation Saviour Montebello,Contemporary records give the surname in various forms: Montebello, Montibello or Mongibello, interchanging from one to the other indiscrimately. The latter two correspond to the dialect pronunciation of the former, and not (as Cassar 2003, under ‚ÄòMontebello‚Äô) claims, that they are three different surnames altogether. son of Joseph (1730APZ, Registrum Baptizatorum [Reg.

He died on 22 April at 38 years of age.) and Catherine n√©e Caruana (1731Ibid., Reg. Bapt., MS 515, fol. 17r. Catherine was born on 9 April. Her parents were Joseph and Mary Caruana.‚Äì?Attempts to locate her death records have unfortunately proved futile.), was born at ≈ªejtun, Malta, on 9 June 1762.Ibid., Reg. Bapt., MS 518, fol. 128v. His parents had married at ≈ªejtun parish church of St. Catherine of Alexandria on 26 September 1752.Ibid., Registrum Matrimonium [Reg. Matrim.], MS 573, fol. 5. and Saviour was their fourth child out of six.His siblings were Grace (born on 27 December 1754), Mary (5 September 1756), Michelangelo (17 December 1758), Vincentia (9 December 1764) and Elizabeth (8 July 1767). See, respectively: Ibid., Reg. Bapt., MS 518, fols. 71r, 89r and 105v, and MS 516, fols. 5 and 42. He was baptised on the same day of his birth at ≈ªejtun's parish church by the deputy parish priest, Joseph Saliba, and given the names Saviour, Francis Xavier and Anthony. His godparents were Joseph Buttigieg, son of Luke, and Rose, wife of Francis Bugeja, both from the ≈ªejtun parish.Ibid., fol. 128v. At the age of 19, in 1781, Montebello entered the bishop's seminary at Floriana to study for the priesthood.Ibid. As was required at the time, his family donated him with a patrimony which could pay for his seminary expenses. This consisted of four properties: two partitions of grasslands around Tas-Silƒ° (limits of ≈ªejtun), and two edifices at ≈ªejtun's village centre. The patrimony was temporarily entrusted to the administration of Michael Pulis,Ibid. the husband of Montebello's older sister, Mary.They had married on 11 January 1778. See APZ, Reg. Matrim., MS 574, fol. 104. Montebello was ordained a priest in 1787, six years after entering the seminary,Abela (1999), 49. most probably by the then Bishop of Malta, Carmelo Scicluna (bishop between 1875 and 1888). Thereafter, Montebello seems to have been stably assigned to pastoral work within and around the parish of ≈ªejtun. Such work does not appear to have hindered him from studying for his Doctorate in Theology. This seems to have been done in Malta (and not abroad). In this case his studies would probably have been pursued, as was normally done, at the Collegium Melitense in Valletta. By 1797, that is ten years after his ordination, he had already acquired his S.T.D..Abela (1999), 49. Family relations Montebello was well connected through his family. His cousin, Giuseppe Montebello (1713APT, Reg. Bapt., vol. 3, fol. 108. He was born on 11 June.‚Äì1833Ibid., Reg. Defun., vol. 5, fol. 107r. He died on 18 February, not on the 8th, as many contend, including http://www.tarxienlocalcouncil.org/?module=content&id;=490), from Tarxien, was the son of Montebello's uncle, Peter,Battistino (1992, 156). and a well-heeled merchant.Battistino (1992), 150, after Vella (1932), 186. He was Capo di Casal Tarxien (Head of Tarxien),Mifsud (1907), 243; Vella (1932), 187. elected by the gentry thereMifsud (1907), Deed before Notary Alexander Peter Spiteri, 243-4. to represent them in all administrative matters.Ibid., Deed before Notary Gregorio Mifsud, 251. During the French presence in Malta (1798), he was chosen to be part of the committee administering one of the twelve municipalities created by Napoleon, that which included Tarxien, ≈ªejtun, ≈ªabbar and Gƒßaxaq.Battistino (1992), 150 Only three months later, however, Montebello was very much involved in the organised resistance of the Maltese against the French between 1798 and 1800. As head of the local provisional government at Tarxien,Mifsud (1907), 251. he was appointed capo battaglione (battalion leader) with operational responsibilities around that locality.Ibid. Together with others, he contributed financially to the two- year war effort,Battistino (1992), 201. and also donated (on 24 December 1798) a considerable part of his wealth to procure wheat and other supplies from Sicily to ease the food shortage that ensued from the revolt.Testa (1980), Deed before Notary Gregorio Mifsud, 194-198 When the British provisionally took over the government of the Maltese islands instead of the French Republican Commission, Giuseppe was elected by the gentry at Tarxien (18 February 1799) to be head of their locality, and thus part of the National Congress created by the representative of the British provisional government, Alexander Ball.Castagna (1985), vol. II, 381. Later, Giuseppe was appointed Logotenente di Governo (Government Lieutenant) of Tarxien.Ibid., vol. III, 44. Afterwards, when the British officially became lords of the land, and partitioned the Maltese islands into six districts, Giuseppe was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of the district comprising Tarxien, Paola, ≈ªejtun, ≈ªabbar, Gudja and Luqa (28 June 1815).Battistino (1992), 156, 269. Giuseppe's house at Tarxien, built by government funds as recompense for his share in the revolt,Ibid., 201. still stands unto this day, and is a tourist attraction.http://www.tarxienlocalcouncil.org/?module=content&id;=490. Another influential close relative, Giuseppe Pulis Montebello (1783‚Äì1855), was Montebello's nephew.He was the son of Montebello‚Äôs sister, Mary (APZ, Reg. Bapt., MS 519, f. 84r). Some sources‚Äïincluding Farrugia Randon (1991, 116‚Äì7, 142‚Äì3), the archives of the University of Malta, and the National Library of Malta‚Äïgive Giuseppe‚Äôs surnames in reverse form (as Montebello Pulis), which is evidently mistaken. He was from ≈ªejtun and resided in Valletta together with his Italian wife Carlotta Bertelli.Abela (2008), 55‚Äì6; Frendo (2004), 164‚Äì5. Giuseppe lived for many years in Livorno, Italy, where he married.Abela (2008), 54‚Äì5. They had at least five children.They were Amelia, Angelo, Alfredo, Gratiulla and Olderigo. Ibid., 55‚Äì7. He and his wife settled in Malta for just a decade or so, and returned to Livorno a few months before Giuseppe's death in 1855.APZ, Liber Solidalit√† dell‚ÄôAgonia, MS 191, fol. 309, and MS 124, fol. 7, cited by ibid., 56‚Äì7. Giuseppe died on 17 July. He was a well-off and self-sufficient merchant.Ibid. He too was elected to the National Assembly (1849‚Äì54).Farrugia Randon (1991), 143. He was very popular with voters, obtaining the largest number of popular votes.Frendo (2004), 165. Three publications of his are known. In 1824 he published Chtieb il Kari Yau Dahla‚Äôal ilsien Malti (A Book of Maltese Reading or An Introduction to the Maltese Language);Cachia (2000), 147. in 1826 Trattat Fuq l‚ÄôObblighi Tal- Bniedem (A Treatise on the Duties of Man);Ibid.; Debono J. (1996), 67. and in 1847 Rendiconto pratico del Campo Esperimentale dell‚ÄôEst (A practical Statement on the Experimental Camp in the East).Societ√† Economico-Agraria. Tipografia Anglo-Maltese: Malta. The first two are credited to be the first books written entirely in the Maltese language.They are reviewed by Cachia (2000), 148‚Äì51 and 151‚Äì5 respectively. See also www.akkademjatalmalti.com/page.asp?p=9023 (1924; in Maltese). Resistance Together with many others, including his uncle Giuseppe, between 1798 and 1800 Montebello was part of the resistance of the Maltese against the French.Mifsud (1907), Document 40, 268. Following G. Fabri, Archive of the family of A.E. Caruana. He was stationed at ≈ªejtun (at Tal-Borg),Battistino (1992), 201. and gave his share within a team of resistance fighters. The team's job was to intercept any manoeuvring by or to the French troops blockaded in Valletta through the road leading to Cottonera from the east, and to organise and manage supplies around that area. Despite some skirmishes‚Äïwhich had even left some casualties on both sidesIbid., 151‚Äì2.‚ÄïMontebello's involvement does not seem to have been military, as some suggested,Abela (2008), 54. but rather of a logistical nature. In fact, together with two others (Luigi Agius, a doctor of canon and civil law, and Vincenzo Borg, later a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George) Montebello served as consultore legale (legal adviser) under the command of Giuseppe Abela.Mifsud (1907), 268. The team's General Headquarters was situated at San Giuseppe (Hamrun), under the general command of Francesco Saverio Caruana.Ibid., 267. Caruana was a MonsignorNaudi (1848), 17. who had studied philosophy under Michael Xerri.Ibid. He was professor of philosophy and mathematics at the bishop‚Äôs seminary at Mdina,Ibid., 18. and later appointed Bishop of Malta (1831‚Äì47). Professor of Philosophy Following the French capitulation on 5 September 1800,Frendo (2004), 10. Montebello was appointed professor of the chair of philosophy at the University of Malta. The chair had been suspended by Napoleon on 18 June 1798,Zammit (1913), Document 9; Vella (1979), 222‚Äì3. but then reinstated by the British by Alexander Ball. On 5 November 1800,Cassar Pullicino (1958), 144‚Äì5. Montebello was chosen to be professor of logic and metaphysics,AAM, vol. I, 11; vol. II, 3-4; Zammit (1913), 6. For a review of AAM, see Laferla (1938). with an honorarium of 200 scudi per annum.AAM, vol. I, 12; vol. II, 3-4; Cassar Pullicino (1958), 144‚Äì5. He was chosen for this office by the newly appointed rector, Saverio Caruana,AAM, vol. I, 8-9; vol. II, 1-2; Ibid., 144. Montebello‚Äôs former ‚Äòpriest-in-arms‚Äô. This was done with the approval of Malta‚Äôs provisional government (which included Montebello's cousin, Giuseppe).Mifsud (1907), 280-1. On the day of his appointment, 5 November,AAM, vol. I, 13; vol. II, 5; Ibid., 147‚Äì8. together with the other newly appointed professors, Montebello called on the rector at his residence in Valletta to thank him for their appointments. Caruana received them most kindly and, as was formerly the practice during the time of the Knights Hospitallers,Zammit (1913), 6. they all proceeded to the palace of the bishop, Vincenzo Labini, in Valletta who then administered to them the oath of office. On the following day, 6 November,AAM, vol. I, 13; vol. II, 5; Mifsud (1907), 147‚Äì8. professors, students and members of the better educated classes assembled in the main hall of the University of Malta in Valletta, where the Augustinian Vincenzo Thei (the professor of moral theology), delivered a solemn oration for the success of the new studies. The British governor, Alexander Ball, was also present for the occasion. Lectures started a week later, on 13 November, after the solemn intonation of the hymn Veni Creator Spiritus in the university church, also at Valletta. Then each professor went to his lecture room and gave a public lecture. Montebello's academic remit at the university was of two hours every week.AAM, vol. I, 10; vol. II, 3. A welcome development occurred on 13 March 1802, when the British governor, Alexander Ball, re-established the practice of conferring degrees, thus giving more weight to the academic institution. In the following month the first ceremony of the conferrement of degrees under British rule was held.Agius (1968), 11. This must have brought on, a few months later, on 5 May 1802, the increase in salary of the university professors, including Montebello's, from two to three hundred scudi per annum by the British Civil Commissioner, Charles Cameron.AAM, vol. I, 20-1; vol. II, 12-3. Following these developments, no other events of note seem to have occurred at the university up till 1813,Agius (1968), 11. well after Montebello's time there. Parish Priest Montebello relinquished the chair of philosophy in 1804 when he was appointed by Bishop Vincenzo Labini as parish priest of Civitatis Cospiqu√¶ (Bormla).AAM, vol. I, 28; vol. II, 20; Tabone (2001), 67. On 3 October of that year, he was succeeded at the university by the professor of humanistic literature and secretary of the university, Peter Mallia, a doctor of canon and civil law.AAM, Ibid. Montebello became vicar (or Parochus pr√¶lectus)APB, Reg. Bapt., vol. 2, fol. 274. of Bormla on 23 June 1804,APB, Reg.

Matrim., vol. 8, fol. 135r ‚Äúinfra‚Äù; Ferres (1866, 301) mistakingly gives the possession day to be the 27th. He was the sixteenth parish priest of BormlaTabone (2001), 67. since the parish‚Äôs inception on 15 September 1586.http://www.cospicuaparish.org.mt/thecity.asp. However, as it happened, he was also its last parish priest, since in 1822, during the tenure of Montebello's successor as parish priest, Giuseppe Bezzina, the parish became a Collegiate by decree of Pope Pius VII.Tabone (2001), 13. Apart of the usual pastoral duties as parish priest, at Bormla Montebello founded, in May 1805, the Confraternity of St. AgathaFerres (1866), 299; Camilleri (2001). and a few months later, on 15 September 1805, the Confraternity of St. Michael.Ferres (1866), 299. Death Montebello remained parish priest for five years.Tabone (2001), 72. Unfortunately, he died suddenly and prematurely at his residence in BormlaAPPV, Reg. Defun., vol. 14, fol. 452. on 18 April 1809,APB, Reg. Defun., vol. 2, fol. 75; ACB, Registrum Music√¶ [Reg. Mus.], vol. 24, no. 47; Ferres (1866), 301. seven weeks before his 47th birthday,.ACB, Reg. Mus., vol. 24, no. 47. Though the last baptism he administered was just two days before his death, on the 16th,APB, Reg. Bapt., vol. 2, fol. 503. he was apparently too ill to officiate at a marriage celebrated less than a week before, on the 11th.APB, Reg. Matrim., vol. 8, f. 298. Oddly enough, his funeral was not held at Bormla, as would have been normal practice, but at the parish church of his birthplace, ≈ªejtun, with the participation of the clergy serving at Bormla.ACB, Reg. Mus., vol. 24, no. 47. Stranger still, for some reason yet unknown he was not buried at ≈ªejtun but was transported again, this time to Valletta, and buried in the crypt of the Collegiate church of St. Paul's Shipwreck,Ibid.; APB, Reg. Defun., vol. 2, fol. 75. in the part reserved for priests.APPV, Reg. Defun., vol. 14, fol. 452 (in sepulcro Sacerdotorum). In gratitude towards the clergy of Bormla, a few days after the funeral, on the 23rd, his sister, Vincenza Montebello, donated 50 scudi to the Bormla collagate per i poveri di Cospicua (for the poor of Bormla).ACB, Reg. Mus., vol. 24, no. 47. Several masses were sung by the Bormla clergy for his repose on the anniversary of his death in the succeeding five years (until 1814).Ibid. More masses were sung for his repose by the clergy at ≈ªejtun almost fifty years later, in 1855, and in succeeding years, by bequest of Giuseppe Pulis Montebello.APZ, MS 175, fols. 167‚Äì181 (following the Deed before Notary Salvatore Tanti), and MS 231, cited by Abela (2008), 56. Works There is as yet no indication that Montebello ever published any works, philosophical or otherwise. In all probability he did not. His class notes on logic and metaphysics, subjects which he taught for four years at the University of Malta, do not seem to have survived, not even in indirect form (by his students). At least, nothing is yet known about their whereabouts. Having said this, however, it might not be irrelevant to point out that the hundreds of manuscripts held at the archive of the Collegiate of Bormla‚Äïone likely place where Montebello's writings might be held‚Äïare still not catalogued. This, as yet, makes it impossible to known for sure whether anything of his philosophical notes survived. To date, it is not known whether Montebello drew up any last will, as was usually done.Given the archival circumstances in Malta, manual research in this regard will have to cover the period from 1778/80 (when Montebello reached the legal age of 16/18 to draw up a will) or when his last parent (his mother) died, up till 1809 (25/27 years and more), an endeavour which is at present unfeasible.

He was the chief gardener of Paris during the reign of Emper√Æor Napoleon III, and was responsible for planting the great gardens of the French Second Empire; the Bois de Boulogne, the Bois de Vincennes, Parc Montsouris, Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, the remaking of the Luxembourg Garden, and many smaller Parisian parks and gardens. He was also responsible for planting trees along the new boulevards of Paris. His landscape gardens, with their lakes, winding paths, sloping lawns, groves of exotic trees and flower beds, had a large influence on public parks throughout Europe and in the United States. Barillet-Deschamps was born in 1824, the son of a gardener. His first job in 1841 was as a monitor and teacher in a revolutionary new kind of prison colony called \\"La Paternelle,\\" founded near Tours in 1839, where the prisoners learned farming and gardening. From there he went to Bordeaux, where he started a gardening enterprise, and met Baron Haussmann, then the Prefect of the Gironde Department. He also met Jean- Charles Adolphe Alphand, an engineer who worked for Haussmann. When the Emperor Napoleon III brought Haussmann to Paris to be the new Prefect of the Seine Department, Haussmann summoned both Alphand and Barillet-Deschamps to Paris. The Emperior had conceived a plan to create large new parks around Paris, to provide green space and recreation for the rapidly growing population of the city. He named Alphand as the head of the new Service des Promenades et Plantations de Paris, and Alphand chose Barillet-Deschamps as the first jardinier en chef, or Chief Gardener of Paris. Barillet-Deschamps worked in close collaboration with Alphand, the engineer Eugene Belgrand (1810-1870), who was charged with providing water to the new parks, and with the architect Gabriel Davioud, who designed all the structures in the parks. Under Alphand‚Äôs guidance, Barillet-Deschamps created the landscapes of the Bois de Boulogne and the Bois de Vincennes, and then the Luxembourg Garden as it appears today; Parc Monceau; the Parc des Buttes Chaumont; and Parc Montsouris. The scale of the projects was gigantic: For the Bois de Boulogne alone, he planted 420,000 trees and seeded 273 hectares of lawns, using 150 kilograms of seed per hectare.Patrice de Moncan, Les Jardins du Baron Haussmann, pp. 59-60. To provide trees, shrubs and flowers for the park, he had gardens and greenhouses built near the racetrack of Longchamps, and at Auteuil. He created another garden at Petit-Bry, on the banks of the Marne River, specially to grow trees to line the boulevards of Paris. At Vincennes, near the fortifications of Paris, he planted another garden especially for cultivating ornamental plants. At Passy, close to the Parc de la Muette, he built another complex of greenhouses, called the Fleuriste de la Muette, especially for flowers and exotic plants. This complex was composed of thirty greenhouses, lit with gas lights, each with its own conditions devoted to different varieties of plants. One group of greenhouses was filled entirely with thousands of fuchsia, chrysanthemum, canna, pelagorium, verveine, calceolaire, and ageratum plants. Individual greenhouses were built to grow palm trees, ficus, camellias, solanum, Caladium, and begonias; and others for banana trees, hibiscus, ferns and other highly specialized plants. There were nearly three million plants in the greenhouses of the Fleuriste de la Muette, tended by about one hundred gardeners. Eduard Andre, Paris-Guide , Paris (1867) cited in Patrice de Moncan, Les Jardins du Baron Haussmann. pp. 43-44. In addition to the large gardens new gardens around the edges of Paris, Barillet-Dechamps was responsible for providing trees to line the newly built avenues that Baron Haussmann was building. A line of holes each three meters wide and one meter deep was dug along each side each boulevard. His gardeners used specially equipped carts, each of which carried one tree. Each cart carrying a tree was positioned over the hole and carefully lowered it into place. The trees came from the garden that Barille-Deschamps had built along the Marne for that purpose. The trees used most often were chestnut trees and platane trees, which Haussmann himself preferred he had seen rows of plantanes in Provence when he was Prefect of the Department of the Var, and he admired their wide leaves and the shade they gave. By 1868, Barillet-Deschamps had planted 102,154 trees along the boulevards of Paris. Haussmann, Memoires, cited by Patrice de Moncan, Les Jardins du Baron Haussmann. p. 133 In addition to his Paris gardens, Barillet-Deschamps traveled widely to advise other cities on their gardens. He helped in the design of gardens in Marseille, in Turin, in Belgium, in Austria, in Prussia, in Turkey, and in Egypt. He began working on a garden for the Khedive of Egypt in 1873, and was still working on it when he became ill, returned to France, and died in Vichy in 1873 at the age of fifty.

Principles of landscaping of Jean-Pierre Barillet- Deschamps Barillet-Deschamps did not write formal treatises about landscape gardening, but in his correspondence he described his method and basic principles when laying out a park: \\"First, study the relief of the site. The natural variations of the terrain, if they are significant, are the major elements to study. \\"The plants form the principal element of the composition. Place the rarest plants so that they are clearly seen. \\"The trees should be placed according to their shape and color to accent the view. \\"The flowers should be placed in masses that are clearly seen and close to any residences. It is desirable to give prominence to those species which are common in the region where they are planted. \\"Nature furnishes the major lines, but the vegetation should not strictly follow the laws of nature. The human intervention remains clear. The contours of the masses of plants should bordered by clear lines which resemble elliptical shapes. \\"Ponds and streams are essential features of a large garden. The course of the stream, and the placement of the ponds, waterfalls, and rocks should be justified by the landscape and appear as natural as possible. The general principle is to preserve the appearance of nature without being an exact copy.\\" \\"A garden is a work of art where sculpture and architecture each have an important place. \\"Once the landscape has been sculpted and the plants laid out, then the alleys and paths are drawn in. \\"The network of alleys should be concentric. The paths which are farthest away must always lead the visitor toward the central parts or toward the habitations. The curves and changes of direction should be gentle and justified by natural obstacles. The alley should lead to its destination by the route that is the most convenient and pleasant. The path should also be hidden as much as possible, and one should see only the particular part off the path that one is on. To achieve that, the path should be slightly sunken so that it disappears in the general relief of the lawns.\\" Luisa Limido, L‚ÄôArt des jardins sous le Second Empire.

Beginning in New York and moving to Los Angeles in the 1960s, his credits included The Virginian, Banacek, Young Maverick, Flying High, Rafferty, Ellery Queen and Murder, She Wrote. In 1979 Robert van Scoyk received an Edgar Allan Poe Award for the Columbo episode Murder Under Glass. Life and career Born in Dayton, Ohio, to Robert Van Scoyk and Gertrude Wardlow, he wrote for local radio before joining the United States Army Air Corps during the last months of World War II. After the war he attended Columbia and New York Universities and began his career in television by working as a pageboy at NBC studios. He married Patricia Schauder and they had two sons. She died in 1971 at age 42 and he later married Leona Plotkin. New York At that time he was also writing a column for the Dayton Daily News about life as a struggling radio and TV writer in Manhattan. New York gossip columnist Earl Wilson helped his career by regularly recounting van Scoyk's adventures in his own column. Van Scoyk‚Äôs first writing credit, together with partner Allan Manings, was for The Imogene Coca Show. His break came when he wrote a script for NBC's The New Faces, a revue show produced by the NBC pages in the late 1940s. He went on to write for The Ann Sothern Show, The Imogene Coca Show, U.S. Steel Hour, Philco Theatre, Armstrong Circle Theater and Kraft Theatre, as well as Ivanhoe and The Betty Hutton Show. Los Angeles In the late 1960s van Scoyk moved to Los Angeles where he wrote, adapted, produced and story edited a wide range of TV series and made- for-television movies, equally at home with comedy, Western, musical comedy, melodrama, medical drama, mystery and detective genres. In 1979 van Scoyk received an Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America for the Columbo episode Murder Under Glass, starring Peter Falk and Louis Jourdan. He is perhaps best remembered for his involvement as writer, producer, executive producer and/or story editor for such shows as The Virginian, Banacek, Young Maverick, Flying High, Rafferty, Ellery Queen and, for the 12 years of its 1984-96 run and after, Murder, She Wrote. In fact for his work on this show he was profiled for the book Successful Scriptwriting, by Jurgen Wolff and Kerry Cox. Death Robert van Scoyk died in Los Angeles, California on August 23, 2002 of complication from diabetes. He was 74. He was survived by his wife of 30 years, Leona Plotkin Van Scoyk, sons Robert, Andy, and Matt Tyrnauer, his father Robert, and sister Lois.

The newspaper appeared between the end of 1923 and the summer of 1928, with 3000‚Äì4000 copies printed an issue. It was subtitled \\"Opruiend Blad Voor Jonge Arbeiders (Agitation Newspaper for Young Workers)\\". Due to the editors' anti-state and anti-militarist views, they often had problems with the police, as when Rinus van de Brink was imprisoned for 2 months for an October 1924 article against military service. The opinions expressed in the paper were also critical of the pacifist wing of the antimilitarist movement, the current of the anarchist movement associated with Domela Nieuwenhuis, labor unions, and the Soviet Union. The Moker group was co-founded by members of the circle that had formed around the earlier Dutch anarchist newspaper, Alarm, including Herman Schuurman, Anton Constandse, and Emily van Bilderbeek. The group was informal, consisting of about 500 youth organized in affinity groups carrying out autonomous activity and meeting three times a year. Many participants were also members of the Social- Anarchistiche Jeugd Organisaties (Social Anarchist Youth Organizations) and the Internationale Anti-Militaristische Vereniging (International Anti- Militarist Union). With Alarm and Arthur Lehning's work, De Moker reinvigorated anarchist thought in the 1920s and 1930s. After the group's end, many participants remained active in the anarchist, antimilitarist, and Freethinkers movements. Many of them participated in the partisan resistance against the Nazi occupation during the Second World War, hiding Jews or carrying out acts of sabotage. Some of them, such as Jo de Haas, were executed by the Nazis, while others survived and remained active in the following decades.For Work is a Crime.

Later he emigrated to London, and became a naturalised British Subject. His paintings were generally small, painted with oils on canvas in an anglicized tradition. Dana's transatlanticism influenced Monet and the French impressionists, whom he met in Paris and Normandy. But his most enduring feature as an artist was a highly personalised, naturalistic style, intimate and affective of familiarity. Yet he remained very much in the romantic vein of older painters from an earlier period, essentially conservative, but observant of mminute detail. Early life William Parsons Dana was born in Boston, Massachusetts on February 18, 1833. He was the son of Samuel Dana, a banker, and Nancy, daughter of Peter Winchester of Boston. He studied at the Chauncy Hall School and graduated from the Boston Latin School, intended for the law, but being from a large wealthy family was not short of money. He left home early and spent much time in New Hampshire, teaching himself to draw at Manchester, NH, learning to sketch in the early 1850s. Like so many American genre painters his early works were dominated by the attraction of rural landscapes that went down to the sea. The animals and children emerged at first in context, and then grew in importance as his career developed. Career Dana was attracted to a sailor's life, and made several voyages, then decided to study art, went to Paris in 1852, became a pupil of Picot and Le Poitevin and a student in the School of arts, and spent his summers sketching in Normandy and Brittany. Some of his earliest sketches are of Manchester, MA. After marrying in 1855, the Danas made their first foray to Paris, France, where he occasionally went to the French salon, but decided to return when the U.S. Civil War erupted. He returned to the United States in 1862, was chosen a full member of the National Academy of Design in 1863, painted in New York City and Newport, Rhode Island, where two years later some of his works found their way to the National Academy as donations by the late James A Suydam.They are now part of the Frick Collection http://research.frick.org/directoryweb/browserecord.php?-action=browse&-recid=7503 Thereafter he emigrated to establish his studio in Paris, France, where he returned after the end of the U.S. Civil War. For the next twelve years he lived and worked in Paris, visiting the many impressionist painters in Normandy and painting many of the same scenes, notably the Rock at Etretat, much favored by Monet. Known as the American Impressionist, he lived with his wife at Rue St Honore Faubourg, Paris, had a studio in the city in some contentment. He often visited Normandy. Among his many paintings there were those of Le Havre and The Rock at Etretat. In 1878, he moved to London with his daughter, Marion for her prospective marriage to a London barrister. That summer he won an International Gold Medal at the Paris Exposition. Dana continued to paint in London, notably the famous view across the Thames to the Palace of Westminster, and Waterloo Bridge, as well as several of the pea-soup fog shrouding the river. His generic paintings included many of donkeys, on beaches, and so on, and others of animals and children. But Dana was probably best known for his seascapes, especially for a self-portrait depicting him wearing sou-wester oilskins. He exhibited at the Society of Artists in Birmingham, England. Works His first pictures were marine views, but subsequently he treated genre subjects with success, and was happy in painting children, horses, and dogs.

Together, they had six children, including: * Marian Caroline Dana (b. 1857), who married Wilson Noble (1854‚Äì1917), an MP for Hastings.

He was also the assistant to John Wolfe Barry on the construction of Tower Bridge, and the Resident Engineer for reconstruction of Kew Bridge. Robert married Anna Kane, daughter of William H. Kane.

The ship under a time charter by the United States Army as a transport during the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. As defending forces became cut off from supply by the Japanese blockade Don Isidro was one of eight ships, only three of which were successful, known to make an attempt to run the blockade. In that attempt, under her captain Rafael J. Cisneros, Don Isidro became involved in the 19 February Japanese attack on Darwin, Australia where, though not in the port, she was strafed, bombed and left off Bathurst Island burning with all lifeboats destroyed. The captain attempted to make land when she grounded about three miles off Melville Island to which survivors swam. Of the sixty-seven crew and sixteen soldiers aboard eleven of the crew and one soldier were killed or missing. Survivors were rescued by HMAS Warrnambool, taken to Darwin, treated at the hospital and then awaited orders at the 147th Field Artillery camp. Pre war Don Isidro was constructed 1939 at Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft A. G., Kiel, Germany for the inter-island passenger service of the De La Rama Steamship Company in Philippine waters. She was a diesel motor ship with two nine cylinder turbocharged engines driving two screws for a speed of twenty knots. The day after Great Britain and France declare war with Germany Don Isidro was subject of an incident at Port Said on 5 September 1939 as she cleared the Suez Canal on her maiden voyage from Kiel to Manila. British authorities removed from the ship two German engineers, sailing with the vessel to provide training and technical support, provoking a diplomatic protest from the United States \\"as illegal and a violation of the neutral rights of the United States\\" on the day after President Roosevelt proclaimed that neutrality. The British explanation was unsatisfactory to the Department of State but was considered closed \\"on the assumption that similar instances will not be permitted to occur in the future.\\" Over the next twenty-six months Don Isidro, along with the smaller and slightly older Don Esteban were noted as the luxury vessels of inter- island passenger service. Then that war caught up again with the 7 December 1941 (Hawaii time) Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the Philippines only hours later on 8 December (Philippine time).The time correlations can be seen in this quote from Morton's Fall of the Philippines on page 79: \\"The duty officer at Asiatic Fleet headquarters in the Marsman Building in Manila on the night of 7‚Äì8 December (Philippine time) was Lt. Col. William T. Clement, USMC. At 0230 of the 8th (0800, 7 December, Pearl Harbor time), the operator at the Navy station intercepted the startling message, 'Air Raid on Pearl Harbor. This is no drill.'\\". Wartime Operations Whatever the movements of Don Isidro between Manila being evacuated and being declared an open city on 23 and 26 December 1941 respectively the ship had come under the War Shipping Administration, allocated to U.S. Army charter on 11 January 1942 at Fremantle, and was in Brisbane, Australia being loaded with rations and ammunition on 22 January 1942 when defenders were ordered to withdraw from the Abucay-Mauban line to final defense lines in Bataan. She left Brisbane on a \\"special mission\\" at 1.45 p.m., 27 January 1942 \\"bound for Corregidor\\" seeking to supply forces still on Bataan. The ship's location in Brisbane was no coincidence. Supplies and ships were being sent to the Netherlands East Indies from Brisbane as the Malay Barrier concept was still alive and the port had been the first stop for a number of ships diverted to Australia with the invasion of the Philippines. Significant supplies, particularly munitions, were already there or on the way from there to Java which was closest to the besieged forces in the Philippines and small, fast blockade running vessels were presumed to be readily available there. Even the prototype seaplane, the Navy's XPBS-1, had been sent to Australia and onward to Java with critical aircraft parts and a rush order of torpedo exploders from San Diego‚Äîand on departure from Pearl 30 January General Patrick Hurley with a bag of cash to add to that dispatched already for procurement locally of vital supplies. Ships of the Pensacola convoy and SS President Polk had been diverted first to Brisbane and then with supplies and munitions intended for the forces in the Philippines to Java. Polk had arrived there 12 January 1942 with 55 P-40E and 4 C-53 aircraft including 55 pilots, 20 million .30 caliber, 447,000 .50 caliber, 30,000 three inch AA and 5,000 75 mm rounds of ammunition along with five carloads of torpedoes, over 615,000 pounds of rations and 178 officers and men in addition to the pilots and herself was heading to Java when Don Isidro was loading and departing for the same destination. At Brisbane Don Isidro was provided defense in the form of a detachment from the 453d Ordnance (Aviation) Bombardment Company of fifteen men under Second Lieutenant Joseph F. Kane, winner of the command by a coin toss. That unit had been embarked aboard the naval transport USS Republic (AP-33) in the Pensacola convoy. The soldiers armed the ship with five .50-caliber heavy machine guns on improvised mounts. Captain Cisneros, even as Coast Farmer was readying to leave Brisbane on the same mission, took the ship south around Australia to Fremantle on the west coast for engine repairs, fuel and water before setting out for Batavia for instructions on the run to Corregidor. Arriving there on 9 February 1942 the entire plan was unraveling as Japanese forces take Tengah airfield and make an additional landing on the island of Singapore as well as begin movements toward Sumatra. Meeting U.S. Navy representatives 10 February, as the situation in Singapore worsens and Japanese are conquering Borneo and the Celebes, the plan is changed with Don Isidro joining a British escorted convoy later that day in passage through Sunda Strait to the Indian Ocean. There the ship would separate from the convoy on the 13th and attempt a run south of Java, through the Timor Sea then through the Torres Straits and finally through the Dampier Strait east of New Guinea for the run through the Bismarck Sea and Pacific to the Philippines. As the ship was making that attempt the Japanese began landing on Sumatra 14 February, Singapore surrendered on the 15th, evacuation of forces from Sumatra to Java was completed, Bali is taken and Java is isolated on the 17th. Of note for Don Isidro's fate, the allied convoy headed to Timor escorted by the is recalled to Darwin on the 18th. The run for the Torres Strait was going without incident until an unknown destroyer and freighter were spotted on the 17th headed in the opposite direction and then on 18 February Don Isidro was attacked twice by a Japanese bomber, though without damage. That attack was decisive in the captain's decision to turn toward the friendly port of Darwin. On the morning of the 19th seven Japanese fighters strafed the ship while she was about 25 miles north of Bathurst Island. This attack holed the ship, destroyed all life boats and rafts and wounded a number of crew and defenders. In early afternoon, at about 1:30 (1330) the ship was again attacked by a single bomber and again escaped bomb damage. Loss Japanese planes returning to their carriers from the Darwin strike, where ships of the Timor convoy were then located, spotted Don Isidro with nine dive bombers, refueled and rearmed from S≈çry≈´ and Hiry≈´, returning with for the final attack on the ship. The result was that shortly after the ineffective single bomber's attack the ship, with no life boats or rafts as a result of the earlier fighter attack, was hit heavily damaged and set in flames. The captain attempted to beach her but was unsuccessful in reaching the island as the engines failed with the ship about three miles offshore. The attacks continued and survivors jumped overboard in an attempt to swim to the island, a process that took about ten hours. Those that reached the island arrived in scattered groups, assembled and began searching for others. They found four dead and that many were missing. In the mid-morning of 20 February H.M.A.S. Warrnambool, having rescued some of the missing crew, picked up the main body of survivors. Warrnambool, with survivors aboard approached the still burning Don Isidro searching for the missing Chief Engineer and Chief Electrician reported to be still aboard and badly burnt and wounded. The ship's deck was already under water and no survivors were found. The survivors aboard Warrnambool reached Darwin about midnight where they were treated overnight at hospital. Then they were billeted at the camp of the 147th Field Artillery awaiting orders. Don Isidro beached and abandoned aground near Melville Island. Eleven of the sixty-seven crew had been killed and many wounded. The killed or missing crew members were: * Marino (Maximo?) Mangan ‚Äì chief Engineer * Loreto Jaime (Jayne?) ‚Äì 2nd Engineer * Mechor Jaruvilla (Melchor Jarobilla?) ‚Äì 3rd Engineer * Antonio Reynes ‚Äì Extra engineer * Federico Montralegra ‚Äì Chief Electrician * Raul Delagado ‚Äì Machinist * Antonio Cordova ‚Äì Oiler * Quirino Sabando ‚Äì Oiler * Alberto Jimena (Jamenen?)- Oiler * Agapito Masangkay (Acapito Masankay?) ‚Äì Pantryman * Amado Logno (Longo?)

Context in attempts to relieve the Philippines Don Isidro was one of eight Army ships known to make the attempt to run the Japanese blockade of the Philippines from Australia or the Netherlands East Indies during the largely failed attempt to supply forces on Bataan and Corrigedor. There were small blockade runners internal to the islands, a few that made the run into those besieged locations with success. Only three of the attempts from outside the islands were successful, one being Don Isidro's De La Rama sister Dona Nati. The others were Coast Farmer, making Anakan in northern Mindanao 17 February, and the Chinese ship Anhui that made Cebu City in march. The Navy managed to make some deliveries and evacuations by submarine.

The Home Rule Crisis was a political and military crisis in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland that followed the introduction of the Third Home Rule Bill in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in 1912. Unionists in Ulster, determined to prevent any measure of home rule for Ireland, formed a paramilitary force, the Ulster Volunteers, which threatened to resist by force of arms the implementation of the Act and the authority of any Dublin Parliament. Irish nationalists responded by setting up the Irish Volunteers \\"to secure the rights and liberties common to all the people of Ireland\\". Both sides then began importing weapons and ammunition from Germany, in the Larne gun-running and Howth gun-running incidents. HM Government's ability to face down unionist defiance was thrown into question by the \\"Curragh incident\\", when dozens of British Army officers tendered their resignations rather than secure arms against Ulster loyalist seizure, forcing a climb-down by the government. The crisis was temporarily averted by the outbreak of World War I. The Home Rule Bill was enacted, but its implementation was suspended for the duration of the war. Background The separate kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain were merged on 1 January 1801 to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Throughout the 19th century Irish opposition to the Union was strong, occasionally erupting in violent insurrection. In the 1830s and 1840s attempts had been made under the leadership of Daniel O'Connell to repeal the Act of Union 1800 and restore the Kingdom of Ireland, without breaking the connection with Great Britain. These attempts to achieve what was simply called Repeal, failed. Struggle for Home Rule In the 1870s the Home Rule League under Isaac Butt sought to achieve a modest form of self- government, known as Home Rule. Under it, Ireland would still remain part of the United Kingdom but would have limited self-government. The cause was then pursued by Charles Stewart Parnell and two attempts were made by Liberal ministries under British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone to enact home rule bills, accompanied by a revival of Ulster's Orange Order to resist any form of Home Rule.Stewart, A. T. Q., The Ulster Crisis, Resistance to Home Rule, 1912‚Äì14, p.31, Faber and Faber (1967) The first bill, with Gladstone's Irish Home Rule speech beseeching parliament to pass the Irish Government Bill 1886 and grant Home Rule to Ireland in honour rather than being compelled to one day in humiliation, was defeated in the Commons by 30 votes after the Liberal Unionists split from the Liberal Party to vote with the pro-unionist Conservative Party. The second Irish Government Bill 1893 was passed by the Commons, but then defeated in the House of Lords, where the Conservative and Liberal Unionist peers enjoyed a huge majority. As early as 1893, plans were floated to raise 2,000‚Äì4,000 men, to drill as soldiers in Ulster. Many Ulster Unionists interpreted the southern and western violence directed against land grievances as pro-Home Rule (and thus believed Home Rule was appeasement of this violence), and resolved to defy the government militarily.Jeffery 2006, p111-13 The Parliament Act In 1909, a crisis erupted between the House of Lords and the Commons, each of which accused the other of breaking historic conventions. Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George, hoping to clear the way for an onslaught on the Lords' veto on legislation, framed his budget so the Lords were likely to reject it. After the Lords, hoping to force a general election, rejected the Finance Bill in November 1909, the Commons accused the Lords of breaking the convention of not rejecting a budget, and the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith appealed to the country.Stewart, A. T. Q.: p.24 The January 1910 General Election left the Liberals and Conservatives equally matched, with John Redmond's Irish Nationalists holding the balance of power in the House of Commons. The price of their support to pass the budget through the Commons (the Lords allowed it to pass, as it now had an electoral mandate) was a measure to curb the power of the House of Lords, the last obstacle to Home Rule. After the Lords rejected that measure, a second general election in December 1910 left the House of Commons arithmetic barely changed. If the Liberals were to defeat the House of Lords, they would need to keep the support of the Irish Party with a Home Rule Bill. With the promise of co- operation from both the late king, Edward VII, and the new king, George V, the Liberals threatened to swamp the Lords with sufficient new Liberal peers to assure the Government a Lords majority. The peers backed down, and the Parliament Act 1911 was passed. The Lords now had no powers over finance bills and their unlimited veto was replaced with one lasting only two years; if the House of Commons passed a bill in the third year and was then rejected by the Lords it would still become law without the consent of the Upper House.Stewart, A. T. Q.: p.25 Although hints about Home Rule had appeared in ministers' speeches throughout 1910, Asquith only admitted that he intended to present a Home Rule Bill late in the December 1910 campaign, when over 500 seats had already finished voting, leading to complaints that the British public had not given that issue a mandate. Third Home Rule Bill On 11 April 1912, the Prime Minister introduced the Third Home Rule Bill which would grant Ireland self-government.Hansard online, start of the debate 11 April 1912; accessed 20 January 2009 Unionist opposition In Ulster, Protestants were in a numerical majority. Much of the northeast was opposed to being governed from Dublin and losing their local supremacy ‚Äì before the Act of Union in 1801, Protestants were the business, political √©lite and landed aristocracy in Ireland. Catholics had only been allowed to vote again in 1793 and been excluded from sitting in parliament until Catholic Emancipation in 1829. Since the Act of Settlement 1701, no Catholic had ever been appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the head of the British government in a country that was 75% Catholic. In 1800 Protestant privilege in Ireland was based on land ownership, but this had diminished from 1885 with the introduction of land purchase by a Land Commission and the Irish Land Acts. By 1912 Protestant influence remained strong in Ulster, based not on farmland but on new industries that had been developed after 1800. Many Protestants in Ulster were Presbyterians, who had also been excluded from power before 1801, but now wanted to maintain the link with Britain. Further, Belfast had grown from 7,000 people in 1800 to 400,000 by 1900, and was then the largest city in Ireland. This growth had depended largely on trade within the British Empire, and it seemed that the proposed Dublin-based parliament elected by a largely rural country would have different economic priorities to those of Belfast and its industrial hinterland. The argument developed that 'Ulster' deserved separate treatment from the rest of Ireland, and that its majority was socially and economically closer to the rest of Britain. Unionists declared that the Irish economy had prospered during the Union, but with Ulster doing better than the rest of Ireland. The Protestants of Ulster had done well with their industries, particularly linen and shipbuilding. They feared a Dublin parliament run by farmers would hamper their prosperity by imposing barriers on trade with Britain.Collins, M. E., Sovereignty and partition, 1912‚Äì1949, pp.4‚Äì6, Edco Publishing (2004) At the time Cork city was also a centre of textiles, heavy industry and shipbuilding on the Island of Ireland at that time.https://archive.org/details/corkitstradecomm00corkrich pg168 but was largely inhabited by Irish Nationalists who were willing to risk relative economic decline in exchange for the fulfilment of their political aspirations. In addition to economic factors Irish Unionists feared that they would suffer discrimination as a religious minority in a Catholic dominated Home Rule Ireland, taking up radical Quaker MP John Bright's slogan \\"Home Rule is Rome Rule\\". They were also concerned that Home Rule would be the first step in an eventual total separation of Ireland and Britain and that this was implicit threat to their cultural identity as being both British and Irish, Irish Nationalism drawing inherent distinction between the two.The Ulster Crisis: Resistance to Home Rule by A. T. Q. StewartCarson; a biography by Geoffrey LewisNot an inch: a study of Northern Ireland and Lord Craigavon by Hugh Shearman Ulster crisis unfolds Unionist march in Belfast, 9 April 1912 All the arguments for and against Home Rule, in general or as proposed in the Bill, were made by both sides from the day it was introduced in April 1912.Hansard speeches \\"Settlement of an old controversy\\"; accessed 20 January 2009 The main issue of contention during the parliamentary debates was the \\"coercion of Ulster\\", and mention was made of whether or which counties of Ulster should be excluded from the provisions of Home Rule. Irish Party leaders John Dillon and Joseph Devlin contending \\"no concessions for Ulster, Ulster will have to follow\\". On 'Ulster Day', 28 September 1912, over 500,000 Unionists signed the Ulster Covenant pledging to defy Home Rule by all means possible, drawn up by Irish Unionist leader Sir Edward Carson and organised by Sir James Craig,Stewart, A. T. Q., pp.58‚Äì68 who in January 1911 had spoken of a feeling in Ulster that Germany and the German Emperor would be preferred to the \\"rule of John Redmond, Patrick Ford (veteran Fenian) and the Molly Maguires\\".Stewart, A. T. Q., Ch.18 \\"The Kaiser's Ulster Friends\\" p.226 Unionists continued to demand that Ulster be excluded, the solution of partition appealing to Craig; Carson, however, as a Dublin man, did not want partition, which would leave 250,000 Southern Unionists at the mercy of a huge nationalist majority. He was willing to talk partition hoping that Redmond would give up Home Rule rather than agree to it.Collins, M. E., Sovereignty and partition, 1912‚Äì1949, p.27, Edco Publishing (2004) Redmond underestimated the resilience and strength of their resistance and thought they were bluffing and would accept Home Rule after Parliament passed it.Collins, M. E., p.28 On New Year's Day 1913, Carson moved an amendment to the Home Rule Bill in the House of Commons, to exclude all nine counties of Ulster and was supported in this by Bonar Law, then leader of the Conservative opposition. Represented mainly by the Ulster Unionist Party and backed by the Orange Order, unionists founded early in 1912 the Ulster Volunteers. They were formed from 100,000 local militia and were reviewed marching by Carson that April. The Unionist Council reorganised the volunteers in January 1913 into the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), who threatened to resist by physical force the implementation of the Act and the authority of any restored Dublin Parliament by force of arms,Stewart, A. T. Q.: Ch.6 \\"An Army with Banners\\" pp.69‚Äì78 fearing that Dublin rule would mean the ascendency of Catholicism‚Äîin the words of one MP, that home rule' in Ireland would prove to be 'Rome RuleStewart, A. T. Q., p.44 Later that year Carson and other leading men in Ulster were fully prepared to abandon the Southern Unionists, Carson's concern for them largely exhausted.Jackson, Alvin (2003). Home Rule: An Irish History 1800‚Äî2000. pp. 145‚Äì46. Phoenix Press. The Nationalists in turn raised the Irish Volunteers from late 1913 and planned to help Britain enforce the Act whenever it was passed, and to oppose Ulster separatism. In the Curragh incident of 20 March 1914, dozens of army officers stationed in Ireland offered to resign or accept dismissal rather than enforce Home Rule on Ulster. In April 1914 the Ulster Volunteers illegally imported 24,000 rifles from Imperial Germany in the Larne gun-running, being worried that force would be used to impose the Act upon the northeast. Nationalists, led by John Redmond, were adamant that any partition was unacceptable, and he declared that they could never assent to the mutilation of the Irish nation. \\"Ireland is a unit ... the two-nation theory is to us an abomination and a blasphemy\\".Stewart, A. T. Q., p. 82 In June 1914 Erskine Childers imported 900 German rifles for the Irish Volunteers in his yacht, the Asgard, in the Howth gun-running. In mid-July Padraig Pearse complained of Redmond's takeover of the Volunteers, that he wanted to arm them for the wrong reasons ‚Äì \\"not against England, but against the Orangemen\\".Townsend, Charles (2006), Easter 1916, the Irish Rebellion, p.90, Penguin Books It seemed that Ireland would slide into a civil war.Collins, M. E., pp. 32‚Äì33 The economic arguments for and against Home Rule were hotly debated. The case in favour was put by Erskine Childers' The Framework of Home Rule (1911) and the arguments against by Arthur Samuels' Home Rule Finance (1912).Home Rule Finance text online Both books assumed Home Rule for all of Ireland; by mid-1914 the situation had changed dramatically. The shaping of Partition Even before the Bill became law, questions arose about proposals to exclude Ulster from the Act.Hansard; Question put on 21 May 1914; accessed 20 January 2009 At the Bill's third reading on 21 May several members asked about a proposal to exclude the whole of Ulster for six years; it seemed remarkable, as the proposal was being made as a new amending Bill in the House of Lords, where the government had less support. Liberal and Irish government supporters were instantly critical of any effort to water down the existing Bill. Lord Hugh Cecil, a Conservative MP, was also mystified, saying: \\"Let them bring in their amending Bill under the Standing Orders before next Tuesday. It is perfectly manifest that somebody is going to be tricked. There is no genuine honest reason for making a secret of this kind. My hope is that it is the Nationalist party who are going to be tricked. It may be them, or it may be us, but that somebody is going to be tricked is perfectly plain ...\\" It now appears that in late May Asquith sought any solution that would avoid, or at least postpone, an Irish civil war. He had not been frank about the new temporary-partition possibility, leaving everyone wondering what, exactly, they were voting for in the main Bill, when it might be seriously altered by the as-yet-unseen Amending Bill that was to be launched in the House of Lords. Sir Edward Carson and the Irish Unionist Party (mostly Ulster MPs) backed by a Lords' recommendation, supported the government's Amending Bill in the Lords on 8 July 1914 for the \\"temporary exclusion of Ulster\\" from the workings of the future Act, but the number of counties (four, six or nine) and whether exclusion was to be temporary or permanent, all still to be negotiated. The compromise proposed by Asquith was straightforward. Six counties of the northeast of Ireland (roughly two-thirds of Ulster), where there was arguably or definitely a Protestant majority, were to be excluded \\"temporarily\\" from the territory of the new Irish parliament and government, and to continue to be governed as before from Westminster and Whitehall. How temporary the exclusion would be, and whether northeastern Ireland would eventually be governed by the Irish parliament and government, remained an issue of some controversy. Redmond fought tenaciously against the idea of partition, but conceded only after Carson had forced through an Amending Bill which would have granted limited local autonomy to Ulster within an all-Ireland settlement. The British government in effect accepted no immediate responsibility for the political and religious antagonisms which in the end led to the partition of Ireland, regarding it as clearly an otherwise unresolvable internal Irish problem. To them, the Nationalists had led the way towards Home Rule from the 1880s without trying hard enough to understand Unionist apprehensions, and were instead relying on their mathematical majority of electors. In the background, the more advanced nationalist views of ideologues such as D. P. Moran had nothing to offer the Unionists. William O'Brien alone made a concerted effort throughout 1912‚Äì13 to accommodate Unionist concerns in his All-for-Ireland League (AFIL) political programme, prepared to concede any reasonable concessions to Ulster, rejected by both the Irish Party and Catholic clergy. After numerous interjections during prolonged debates in the Commons, the eight Independent AFIL Party MPs abstained from voting on the final passing of the Bill on 25 May, in protest that no account had been taken of Protestant minority concerns and fears.O'Donovan, John. \\"The All-for-Ireland League and the Home Rule debate, 1910‚Äì14\\". Ch.7, pp. 138‚Äì163. In Doherty, Gabriel (ed.), The Home Rule Crisis 1912‚Äì14, Mercier Press Cork (2014) The AFIL stating the Bill was in effect a \\"partition deal\\" after the government introduced Carson's Amending Bill into the House of Lords to give effect to the exclusion of Ulster constructed on the basis of county option and six-year exclusion, the same formula rejected by Unionists in March.Jackson, Alvin, p. 159 To save endless debate in parliament, George V called a Buckingham Palace Conference with two MPs from each of the British Liberal and Conservative parties, and two each from the nationalists and unionists, held between 21 and 24 July, which achieved very little, except a flicker of understanding between Carson and the Nationalists, that if Ulster were to be excluded, then in its entirety, that the province should come in or out as a whole.Jackson, Alvin, pp.161‚Äì163 The passing of the Bill With the outbreak of war with Germany in August 1914, Asquith decided to abandon his Amending Bill, and instead rushed through a new bill the Suspensory Act 1914 which was presented for Royal Assent simultaneously with both the Government of Ireland Act 1914 and the Welsh Church Act 1914; although the two controversial Bills had now finally reached the statute books on 18 September 1914, the Suspensory Act ensured that Home Rule would be postponed for the duration of the conflictJackson, Alvin: p.164 and would not come into operation until the end of the war.Hennessey, Thomas (1998). \\"The passing of the Home Rule Bill\\". Dividing Ireland: World War I and Partition. p.76. Routledge Press. Eventually Home Rule was considered by the Irish Convention in 1917‚Äì18, and by the cabinet from September 1919; the Welsh Church Act was delayed until March 1920. The Ulster question was 'solved' in the same way: through the promise of amending legislation which was left undefined. Unionists were in disarray, wounded by the enactment of Home Rule. and by the absence of any definite arrangement for the exclusion of Ulster.Jackson, Alvin, p. 166 The Unionist opposition in Parliament claimed that this manoeuvre by Asquith was a breach of the political truce agreed on at the start of the war. However, with the Home Rule Bill effectively put into limbo, and the arguments surrounding it still capable of being resurrected before home rule was actually to come into operation, Unionist politicians soon left the issue aside in the face of more pressing war concerns. Nationalists, in the belief that independent self-government had finally been granted, celebrated the news with bonfires alighting the hill-tops across the south of Ireland. But as the Act had been suspended for the duration of what was expected to be a short war, this decision was to prove crucial to the subsequent course of events. Aftermath The outbreak of the war, and Ireland's participation in it, ended the Home Rule Crisis at a stroke. Carson committed his Ulster Volunteers to the war effort, and when on 3 August 1914 Redmond, in the House of Commons, said that the Irish Volunteers would undertake the defence of Ireland, in co-operation with the Ulster Volunteers, the Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, said that \\"the one bright spot in the very dreadful situation is Ireland. The position in Ireland ... is not a consideration among the things we have to take into account now.\\"Tim Pat Coogan, Ireland in the 20th Century, Random House, 2009, p. 40 On 18 September 1914 the Home Rule Bill received Royal Assent, but at the same time a Suspensory Act was passed to stop it coming into effect until after the war, and it was made clear that an Amending Act would be re-introduced before it became operative.Coogan (2009), pp. 44‚Äì45 On the outbreak of war, however, the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) began planning an insurrection.Coogan (2009), p. 45 The Easter Rising took place in April 1916.Coogan (2009), pp. 53‚Äì59 As a result of the Rising, and the executions and mass imprisonment that followed it, the Irish people became disillusioned with the nationalist Home Rulers. This became apparent in the North Roscommon by-election of February 1917, when Count Plunkett, father of the executed 1916 leader Joseph Plunkett, defeated the Irish Party candidate in what had hitherto been a safe seat.James F. Lydon, The Making of Ireland: From Ancient Times to the Present, Routledge, 1998, p. 343 The Conscription Crisis of 1918 further galvanised support for political separatism. A month after the end of the war, the Irish party was routed by Sinn F√©in in the 1918 general election, leading to the establishment of the First D√°il and the Declaration of Independence.Lydon (1998), pp. 344‚Äì45 The Government of Ireland Act 1920 partitioned Ireland, setting up separate Home Rule Parliaments in Dublin and in Northern Ireland.John Ranelagh, A Short History of Ireland, Cambridge University Press, 1994, p. 257.

The platform inherits UI similarities mostly from MeeGo \\"Harmattan\\", and replaces Series 40 on Nokia's low-end devices. The user interface design team was headed by Peter Skillman, who had worked previously on webOS and the design of MeeGo for the Nokia N9. It is the successor to the Meltemi project which Nokia was developing as a Linux platform to replace Series 40, but was cancelled in July 2012. The first phone based on the platform is the Nokia Asha 501, and were followed by the Asha 500, Asha 502 Dual SIM, and Asha 503, all announced at Nokia World in October 2013. Another phone, the Nokia Asha 230 was announced on 24 February 2014, comes pre-installed with Asha platform 1.4. Apps for the platform are either made using Java ME, or as web apps, which are rendered by the Nokia Xpress browser which uses the Gecko rendering engine. The mobile operating system lacks true multitasking but the radio and music app can run in background mode (which is advertised as multitasking), while swiping to fastlane apps will actually close down previously opened applications instead of minimising them. It features a notification centre, named Fastlane, which is accessible by swiping to the left of the home screen. The platform is supplemented by the Nokia X software platform, Nokia's customised version of Android, seen on the Nokia X, which draws cues from the Asha platform, including the Fastlane notification centre. In a company memo released in July 2014, Microsoft announced that as part of cutbacks, they would cease development of the Asha, Series 40, and X range entirely, in favor of solely producing and encouraging the use of Lumia Windows Phone products. Meltemi A much rumoured project, \\"Meltemi\\" was the codename of a new Linux-based operating system for low-end handsets.

The authors further explain that Meltemi originated as a research project in 2010 under then-CEO Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo; that \\"Clipper\\" was to be a device sibling to the Nokia Lumia 610; that a tablet device for developing markets was planned; and that it was part of the company's \\"Next Billion\\" programme, much like what the Asha platform would become. In addition in June 2012 it was announced that a Nokia R&D; centre in Ulm, Germany, where apparently much development took place, would close down in cuts. The book states that the main reason of Meltemi's cancellation was that the costs of bringing it to market would have hit the company's cash assets too hard, at a time when they were already financially struggling.https://medium.com/@harrikiljander/operation-elop-6f2b043f52c5 Platform evolution Camera app Asha Platform 1.0 Java APIs: HERE API, Nokia Gesture API, Nokia Frame Animator API, File Selection API, Image Scaling API, Network State API, Contact API, Phone Settings API, JSR 172 (Web Services), JSR 177 (Security and Trust), JSR 179 (Location), JSR 211 (Content Handler), JSR 234 (Multimedia Supplements), JSR 256 (Mobile Sensor API), JSR-238 (Mobile Internationalization), JSR 75 (File and PIM), JSR 82 (Bluetooth), JSR 118 (MIDP 2.1), JSR 135 (Mobile Media), JSR 139 (CLDC 1.1), JSR 184 (3D Graphics), JSR 205 (Messaging), JSR 226 (Vector Graphics), Supported models: Nokia Asha 501 Asha Platform 1.1 Features (new compared to 1.0): WhatsApp, easy capture and share videos, Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync, VoIP and Fastlane is more personalised and more closely integrated with your social networks.

She was the first woman and first African American to receive a master's degree from the University of Hawaii, and was also the university's first female and African American chemistry professor. Early life and education Alice Augusta Ball was born on July 24, 1892, in Seattle, Washington, to James Presley and Laura Louise (Howard) Ball. She was one of four children, with two older brothers, William and Robert, and a younger sister, Addie. Her family was middle-class and well off, as Ball's father was a newspaper editor of the Colored Citizen, photographer, and lawyer. Her mother also worked as a photographer. Her grandfather, James Ball Sr., was a famous photographer, and one of the first Black Americans to make use of daguerreotypy, the process of printing photographs onto metal plates. Some researchers have suggested that her parents' and grandfather's love for photography may have played a role in her love for chemistry, as they worked with mercury vapors and iodine sensitized silver plates to develop photos. Despite being prominent members and advocates of the African American community, both of Ball's parents are listed as \\"White\\" on her birth certificate. This may have been an attempt to reduce the prejudice and racism their daughter would face and help her \\"pass\\" in white society. Alice Ball and her family moved from Seattle to Honolulu in 1903 in hopes that the warm weather would relieve her grandfather's arthritis. He died shortly after the move and in 1905 they relocated back to Seattle after only a year in Hawaii. After returning to Seattle, Ball attended Seattle High School and achieved top grades in the sciences. She graduated from Seattle High School in 1910. Ball went on to study chemistry at the University of Washington, earning a bachelor's degree in pharmaceutical chemistry in 1912 and a second bachelor's degree in the science of pharmacy two years later in 1914. Alongside her pharmacy instructor, Williams Dehn, she published a 10-page article, \\"Benzoylations in Ether Solution\\", in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Publishing such an article in a respected scientific journal was an uncommon accomplishment for a woman and especially for a Black woman at this time. After graduating, Ball was offered many scholarships. She received an offer from the University of California Berkeley, as well as the College of Hawaii (now the University of Hawaii), where she decided to study for a master's degree in chemistry. At the College of Hawaii, her master's thesis involved studying the chemical properties of the Kava plant species. Because of this research and her understanding of the chemical makeup of plants, she was later approached by Dr. Harry T. Hollmann to study chaulmoogra oil and its chemical properties. Chaulmoogra oil has been the best treatment available for leprosy for hundreds of years, and Ball developed a much more effective injectable form. In 1915 she became the first woman and first Black American to graduate with a master's degree from the College of Hawaii. Ball was also the first African American \\"research chemist and instructor\\" in the College of Hawaii's chemistry department. Treatment for leprosy At the University of Hawaii, Ball investigated the chemical makeup and active principle of Piper methysticum (kava) for her master's thesis. Because of this work, she was contacted by Dr Harry T. Hollmann at Kalihi Hospital in Hawaii, who needed an assistant for his research into the treatment of leprosy. At the time, leprosy or Hansen's Disease was a highly stigmatized disease with virtually no chance of recovery. People diagnosed with leprosy were exiled to the Hawaiian island of Molokai with the expectation that they would die there. The best treatment available was chaulmoogra oil, from the seeds of the Hydnocarpus wightianus tree from the Indian subcontinent, which had been used medicinally from as early as the 1300s. But the treatment was not very effective, and every method of application had problems. It was too sticky to be effectively used topically, and as an injection the oil's viscous consistency caused it to clump under the skin and form blisters rather than being absorbed. These blisters formed in perfect rows and made it look \\"as if the patient's skin had been replaced by bubble wrap\\". Ingesting the oil was not effective either because it had an acrid taste that usually made patients vomit it up. At age 23, Ball developed a technique to make the oil injectable and absorbable by the body. Her technique involved isolating ester compounds from the oil and chemically modifying them, producing a substance that retained the oil's therapeutic properties and was absorbed by the body when injected.Ignotofsky, Rachel (2016). \\"Women in Science: 50 Fearless Pioneers Who Changed the World\\" Ten Speed Press: pp.45 Unfortunately, due to her untimely death, Ball was unable to publish her revolutionary findings.Maggs, Sam (2016). \\"Wonder Women: 25 Innovators, Inventors, and Trailblazers Who Changed History.\\" Quirk Books: pp. 36-39. Arthur L. Dean, a chemist and later the president of the University of Hawaii, stole her work, published the findings, and began producing large quantities of the injectable chaulmoogra extract. Dean published the findings without giving Ball credit, and named the technique after himself. In 1920, a Hawaii physician reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association that 78 patients had been discharged from Kalihi Hospital by the board of health examiners after treatment with injections of Ball's modified chaulmoogra oil. The isolated ethyl ester remained the preferred treatment for leprosy until sulfonamide drugs were developed in the 1940s. It was not until years after her death that Hollmann attempted to correct this injustice. He published a paper in 1922 giving credit to Ball, calling the injectable form of the oil the \\"Ball method.\\" Unfortunately, she still remained forgotten in the scientific record. In the 1970s, Kathryn Takara and Stanley Ali, professors at the University of Hawaii, searched the archives to find Ball's research. After numerous decades they were able to bring her efforts and achievements to light, giving her the credit she earned. Death and recognition Ball died on December 31, 1916, at age 24. She had become ill during her research and returned to Seattle for treatment a few months before her death. A 1917 Pacific Commercial Advertiser article suggested that the cause may have been chlorine poisoning due to exposure while teaching in the laboratory. It was reported that Ball was giving a demonstration on how to properly use a gas mask in preparation for an attack, as World War I was raging in Europe.UWSOP alumni legend Alice Ball, Class of 1914, solved leprosy therapy riddle But the cause of her death is unknown, as her original death certificate was altered to cite tuberculosis. The first recognition of Ball's work came six years after her death when, in 1922, she was briefly mentioned in a medical journal, with her method being called the \\"Ball Method\\". After the work of many historians at the University of Hawaii including Kathryn Takara and Stanley Ali, the University of Hawaii finally honored Ball in 2000 by dedicating a plaque to her on the school's only chaulmoogra tree behind Bachman Hall. On the same day, the former Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii, Mazie Hirono, declared February 29 \\"Alice Ball Day,\\" which is now celebrated every four years. In 2007 the University Board of Regents honored Ball with a Medal of Distinction, the school's highest honor. In March 2016 Hawai ªi Magazine placed Ball on its list of the most influential women in Hawaiian history. In 2018 a new park in Seattle's Greenwood neighborhood was named after Ball. In 2019 the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine added her name to the frieze atop its main building, along with Florence Nightingale and Marie Curie, in recognition of their contributions to science and global health research. In February 2020, a short film, The Ball Method will premiere at the Pan African Film Festival. University of Hawaii students have asked whether more should be done to resolve the wrongful actions of former President Dean, including proposals to rename Dean Hall after Ball instead.

He was most famous for attaching a 700-pound ball and chain around the foot of Jonathan Borofsky's Hammering Man outside of the Seattle Art Museum and for various other illegal art sculptures left at Westlake Park. These actions ended in July 1996 when Sprinkle's final sculpture caused a bomb scare and Sprinkle was briefly imprisoned. After suffering a mental breakdown in jail, Sprinkle stopped making art and became a born again Christian. He died in 2005 after being hit by a train. Life Sprinkle was born in Fullerton, California and raised in Seattle. In his youth he earned his GED from Job Corps and learned the craft of welding. On Labor Day, September 6, 1993 Sprinkle and a group of other local Seattle artists caused a local sensation by illegally attaching a 700-pound ball and chain around the foot of Jonathan Borofsky's Hammering Man outside of the Seattle Art Museum. The Seattle Arts Commission's director Wendy Ceccherelli famously criticized the group's actions and publicly stated \\"I wouldn't call these people artists, I'd call them fabricators of the attachment.\\" Sprinkle and his friends then began calling themselves the Fabricators of the Attachment, or FA, and Sprinkle earned the nickname \\"Subculture Joe.\\" Other members of the Fabricators of the Attachment included Art Donnelly, Rob Shealy and Jim Blanchard. The Ball and Chain was attached to Hammering Man until September 8, when the Seattle Engineering Department removed it. It was then auctioned off for $1,300 in October 1993 for a fundraiser for Job Corps. On Valentine's Day 1994 Sprinkle and the Fabricators of the Attachment installed a 13-foot steel sculpture of a black heart with a dagger in it titled The Heart of Seattle in Westlake Park in the middle of downtown Seattle. Sprinkle and the Fabricators of the Attachment continued to make and illegally install sculptures at Westlake Park for several years in the mid-1990s, such as a large Frankenstein-inspired sculpture called Frankentree. On July 15, 1996 Sprinkle left another sculpture in Westlake Park, intending it to be his last sculpture of that type. The sculpture used Sprinkle's own pickup truck (which had always been used to deliver the previous sculptures to Westlake Park) with a large metal, anatomically correct 10-foot human heart loaded into it. Titled The Heart of the American Youth, Sprinkle was inspired to make the sculpture after the unhappy end of a romantic relationship and originally intended to deliver the sculpture to President Bill Clinton.It was originally commissioned by Job Corps to celebrate its thirtieth anniversary on Washington D.C. Sprinkle drove the heart around parts of the country and visited several Job Corps site to lecture and allow young people to sign the heart. One such signature included the words \\"The Bomb!\\", intended as a slang term for being great. This caused the Seattle Police to call the bomb squad, utilize a bomb robot and seal off a nine-block area in downtown Seattle for four hours. Sprinkle was arrested and served 33 days in jail as a suspected terrorist. In jail he began to suffer from a mental breakdown after not being allowed to take his prescribed medication. After he got out of jail Sprinkle visited family members in Mississippi. There he became a born again Christian and renounced his artistic ambitions. When he returned to Seattle his religious beliefs alienated him from friends and members of the arts community. Sprinkle's artwork became less and less frequent after being arrested and was only shared with family and close friends. According to his mother, Sprinkle \\"worked on a couple pieces, with crosses and stuff, but he didn't follow through. He just didn't have the same drive and excitement.\\" Sprinkle died on May 16, 2005 at the age of 35, while he was visiting family and working as a youth minister in Long Beach, Mississippi. He was hit by a freight train and his body was later discovered by a passing train conductor. There were no witnesses and his death was ruled as accidental. In October 2008 Seattle artist Doug Parry and Sprinkle's mother attempted to arrange to have the original Ball and Chain used in 1993 installed at the Olympic Sculpture Park in downtown Seattle. The sculpture was owned by Tacoma developer Jan Schmalenberg, who had it on display in a Tacoma office building.

His early career was disrupted by injury and he made only one appearance in each of his first two seasons. As a four-year-old he established himself as a top-class performer without winning an important race as he was placed in some of the most prestigious weight-for-age races in Europe, twice finishing second to Frankel. As a five-year-old he won his first major race when recording an easy victory in the Lockinge Stakes and went on to record his most important success in the Champion Stakes. Background Farhh is a bay horse with no white markings bred by the Darley Stud, the breeding arm of Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation. His sire Pivotal was a top class sprinter who won the King's Stand Stakes and the Nunthorpe Stakes in 1996. He went on to become an \\"excellent\\" sire, getting the winners of more than a thousand races across a range of distances including Sariska, Somnus, Kyllachy (Nunthorpe Stakes) and Excellent Art. Farhh's dam Gonbarda was a highly successful racehorse in Germany, winning the Deutschland Preis and the Preis von Europa as a three- year-old in 2005. As a granddaughter of the broodmare Grimpola she was closely related to the Ascot Gold Cup winner Fame and Glory. Racing career 2010-2011: early career On his racecourse debut, Farhh was ridden Ted Durcan in a seven furlong maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse on 24 July 2010. He started the 13/8 joint-favourite in a field of seven and won by six lengths from Flodden. Farrh was an intended runner in the Frank Whittle Partnership Conditions Stakes at Doncaster on 10 September 2010, where he would have opposed Frankel for the first time, but became worked up in the stalls and was withdrawn before the race started. After being off the racecourse for fifteen months, Farhh reappeared as a three-year-old in a one-mile handicap race at Newmarket on 29 October 2011. Ridden by Silvestre de Sousa he carried 125 pounds and won \\"readily\\" by two and a half lengths from nineteen opponents. 2012: four-year-old season On his four-year-old debut Farhh ran in the Thirsk Hunt Cup, over a mile, at Thirsk Racecourse on 5 May in which he was ridden by Antioco Murgia, claiming 5 pounds. Carrying top weight of 128 pounds he took the lead two furlongs from the finish and accelerated clear of his rivals to win by six lengths. Farhh was then moved up to the highest level for the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. Ridden for the first time by Frankie Dettori he sustained his first defeat as he finished third of the eleven runners behind So You Think and Carlton House. Seventeen days later Farhh started favourite for the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse. He was restrained by Dettori in the early stages before producing a strong challenge in the straight, but failed by half a length to catch Nathaniel. At Goodwood Racecourse in July he finished six lengths second to the world's top-rated racehorse Frankel in the Sussex Stakes over one mile. Farhh took on Frankel again in the International Stakes over ten and a half furlongs at York. He was beaten seven lengths by the Henry Cecil-trained champion, but got the better of a sustained contest with St Nicholas Abbey for second place. On his final appearance of the season Farhh was sent to France for the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp on 16 September in which he was beaten a head by the French-trained filly Moonlight Cloud. 2013: five-year-old season Racing silks of Godolphin Farhh began his fourth season on 18 May 2013 in the Lockinge Stakes over one mile at Newbury Racecourse. Ridden by de Sousa, he took the lead approaching the final furlong and pulled clear to win by four lengths to record his first major victory. Having picked up a further injury in the weeks following his Lockinge romp, Farhh's next racecourse appearance was the Champion Stakes, run over 10 furlongs, at Ascot on 19 October. Farhh, ridden again by Silvestre de Sousa, started as the 11/4 second favourite for the end-of-season highlight behind French champion Cirrus des Aigles. The 10 horse field also included Ruler Of The World, Mukhadram (Brigadier Gerard Stakes, York Stakes), Hillstar, Main Sequence, Parish Hall, Triple Threat and Hunter's Light. Farhh, under de Sousa, soon took keen hold coming out of stall 5 and tracked early leader Hunter's Light, also owned by Godolphin, in company with Morandi and Triple Threat. After travelling smoothly through the whole race Farhh preceded to take over the running into the home straight, with the move being covered by Christophe Soumillon on 11-time group winner Cirrus Des Aigles. After leading over a furlong out, Farhh was soon under pressure and quickly chased by the seemingly full-of- running Cirrus des Aigles with Ruler Of The World and jockey Ryan Moore challenging from very wide, having come round the whole field. Farhh was pressed by the challengers well into the final furlong and along with Cirrus des Aigles and Ruler Of The World, moved well clear of the rest of the field. However, following a pulsating run to the line, where the three principles were split by no more than a length, Farhh found more on the front end and held off the late challenges to hold on gamely to win by a neck at the finish line from Cirrus Des Aigles on his outside in second and Ruler Of The World (on the outside of Cirrus des Aigles) a half length back in third. At the line there was a clear 6 length gap back to Hunter's Light, who held on for fourth from Mukhadram in fifth who was followed by Hillstar, Morandi, Main Sequence, Parish Hall and Triple Threat. The finishing time was 2m 12.02s on the soft turf course. In the aftermath, trainer Saeed bin Suroor went on to say: \\"this horse is a great fighter. He had a break after winning the Lockinge and he has been a miler in the past but a mile and a quarter was great for him today on that ground. He was the best horse in the race today. I am very proud of him and this is good for Godolphin. Every year, he has had problems. Luckily, he has won a pair of Group 1s on his last two races. He is a great horse and I am so happy. He's been a very tough horse since he was a two-year-old but we've just had to look after him with a different programme to keep him sound. His last piece of work was brilliant and the ground was a concern but he handled it well.\\" It was announced soon afterwards that Farhh would retire from racing to stand as a stallion at Dalham Hall Stud in Newmarket in 2014. Farhh retired with a record of 5 wins (twice at group 1 level), 4 seconds and a third from 10 career starts and an official rating of 124. Assessment In the 2012 edition of the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings Farhh was given a rating of 124, making him the thirteenth best racehorse in the world and the equal of Camelot, Animal Kingdom, Danedream and Bodemeister.  Stud career  Farhh retired to stud for the 2014 breeding season. While he is subfertile, having just 39 runners in Great Britain and Ireland as of May 2019, he has nonetheless had success at stud. Some of his most notable runners include King of Change, Epsom Derby runner-up Dee Ex Bee, Prix Hocquart winner Nocturnal Fox, and group 3 winner Wells Farhh Go.

It has been described as a \\"watchdog that values integrity in both sport and the journalists that cover it\\". Play the Game is headquartered in the Danish city of Aarhus and is supported by yearly grants from the Danish Ministry of Culture through the Danish Institute for Sports Studies.  Origins  The initiative was founded in 1997, when the Danish Gymnastics and Sports Associations (DGI) celebrated the centenary of its sports political weekly magazine, Ungdom & Idr√¶t (Youth & Sport). To mark the event, DGI hosted an international media seminar on sports politics, called \\"Sport, Media and Civil Society\\" at its headquarters in Vingsted. The conference resulted in the formation of the Sports Intelligence Unit, an international network of journalists, sportsmen and women and sports administrators which was dissolved in 2004 as Play the Game was established as an independent institution with the backing of all major domestic sports organisations and the Danish Ministry of Culture. The institution came into being at a time when the extent of corruption and doping in sport, especially professional cycling, was becoming increasingly apparent, and doping, corruption and match-fixing remain some of its core themes.  International activities  Play the Game is represented in the European Union's Expert Group on Good Governance in Sports, established by the Council of Ministers, as well as the Consultative Committee of the Enlarged Partial Agreement on Sport under the Council of Europe. It was invited to give testimony before the German Parliament in September 2011, the European Parliament in December 2012 and the Commonwealth Advisory Body on Sport in June 2013. It is an advisor to the Editorial Board of the International Council of Sport Science and Physical Education and regularly gives lectures at seminars and conferences around the world. These have included Beijing Sport University (2013), the 15th International Anti-Corruption Conference in Brasilia (2012), Birkbeck Sports Business School at London University (2012), and the 20th conference of the European Association for Sports Management (2012). Seminars have been held in Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, Colombia, Slovenia, Belgium and Switzerland. Since 2012, Play the Game has also been the coordinator of the Action for Good Governance in International Sports Organisations (AGGIS), an initiative launched in co-operation with Loughborough University, Utrecht University, the University of Leuven, the German Sport University Cologne, IDHEAP Lausanne, the University of Ljubljana and the European Journalism Centre in Maastricht.  Current organization  In January 2011, Play the Game merged with the Danish Institute for Sports Studies, an independent institution set up by the Danish Ministry of Culture. Play the Game's International Director is Jens Sejer Andersen, while the Director of the institute is Henrik H. Brandt.  Conferences  Including the initial seminar, Play the Game has held seven international conferences, most recently in Aarhus, Denmark, in October 2013. Other conferences include Copenhagen in 2000, 2002 and 2005, Reykjavik, Iceland, in 2007, Coventry, UK, in 2009 and Cologne, Germany, in 2011. Conferences cover a wide range of themes. Issues covered include corruption and ethics in sport, sports management, sports journalism, and sports participation. They aim to strengthen the basic ethical values of sport by encouraging stakeholders in sport to engage in open and unrestricted debate on sports challenges and their possible solutions. Each conference has hosted over 100 speakers. Previous speakers have included British investigative journalist and author Andrew Jennings, former World Anti Doping Association President and present IOC member Richard W Pound, Italian anti-doping expert Alessandro Donati, Guardian journalist David Conn, three-time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond, Canadian author Declan Hill, former Newcastle United goalkeeper Shaka Hislop, and President of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) Pat McQuaid.  Play the Game Award  The Play the Game Award is a prize awarded by Play the Game to a person or persons who have shown \\"remarkable personal courage and commitment to creating a better sports community\\".

The rebels managed to capture 10 villages during their offensive. However, the Army soon retaliated and reversed all of the rebels gains, as well as capturing the town of Halfaya, which the rebels captured during their previous offensive, five months earlier. Offensive Opening rebel attacks Situation in Hama city mid-March 2013 On 25 April, rebel forces launched an attack in Hama city, where heavy clashes erupted for the first time in months as rebels tried to relieve pressure on their forces under attack from government troops elsewhere in the country. The next day, clashes occurred in the neighborhood of Tariq Halab between the Army and the rebels. Video footage emerged of several soldiers being burned alive in an armored vehicle. Army captures Halfaya and rebels advance On 10 May, a cease- fire agreement between government and rebel forces in Halfaya broke down. Heavy shelling of the town started in which 25 people were reportedly killed. Government forces tightened the siege on Halfaya and the town of Aqrab, shutting down communications in the area. The shelling of Halfaya and Aqrab was seen as preparation to storm the towns. On 17 May, rebels captured four Alawite villages in the eastern part of Hama province. The villages were abandoned by its residents days before the rebels arrived. The villages in question were Tulaysiyah, Zoghbe, Shaata and Balil. Their takeover followed several weeks of fighting after which the Army withdrew from the area. On 19 May, the Syrian Army took control of Halfaya after rebel forces retreated from the town. The takeover was reportedly followed with the burning of homes by government troops and the execution of 15 people by pro-government militias, according to the opposition. On 23 May, rebels reportedly took control of three more villages in the eastern part of the province. On 24 May, government forces raided the town of Ma'arzaf, and two days later captured the village of Rihya. Army counter-attack On 1 June, after heavy fighting, the Syrian Army recaptured the two Alawite villages of Tulaysiyah and Janineh and on 2 June they recaptured the Alawite village of Zoghbe, after the withdrawal of rebel forces, according to SOHR. By 3 June, the Army had captured 13 villages in Hama province during their offensive, including the ones captured by the rebels earlier in the operation, according to state TV and SOHR. According to the Syrian news agency SANA, by 10 June, the Syrian military captured six more villages in eastern Hama. Three days later, the capture of three of those six villages, as well as one other, was confirmed by SOHR. At dawn on 13 June, rebels seized an Army position on the northern edge of the town of Morek, in fighting that killed six soldiers and two rebels. Later in the day, the Army shelled the base and sent reinforcements in an attempt to recapture the post. On 14 June, fighting took place in the village of Um Meil, to the east of Salamiyah, with the Army capturing the village. The next day, after fierce fighting, the Syrian Army took control of the towns of Rasm al-Abd and Rasm al-Awabed, southeast of Salamiyah. Aftermath On 7 July, the Syrian Army captured the town of Hayalin.

During the late 20th century, it was the most successful of the American leather magazines, and sold overseas. The publication had a major impact of spreading gay leather as a lifestyle and masculinity as a gay ideal.

Manga artist Gengoroh Tagame has pointed to the magazine's illustrated strips as a major influence on his own work.  History   Original run  Drummer was founded in Los Angeles by John H. Embry and Jeanne Barney, but because of police harassment moved to San Francisco in 1977, with Jack Fritscher as new editor-in-chief. Fritscher became the magazine's most frequent contributor as editor, writer, and photographer. Subsequent editors included Robert Payne and Robert W. Rowberry. Despite Fritscher's personal dislike for Nazism, the gay National Socialist League was allowed to advertise in Drummer during the 1970s and 1980s.Fritscher, Jack, and Mark Hemry. ‚ÄúDrummer 19: Astrologic Capricorn.‚Äù Gay San Francisco: Eyewitness Drummer: a Memoir of the Sex, Art, Salon, Pop Culture War, and Gay History of Drummer Magazine, the Titanic 1970s to 1999, vol. 1, Palm Drive Pub., 2008, pp. 405‚Äì405. Today, the magazine states a zero-tolerance policy for writers, artists, or organizations associated with hate of any kind, including racism, transphobia, and misogyny. In Drummer, Fritscher was the first writer and editor to feature \\"older men\\" (#24, September 1978) in the gay press. The magazine arranged yearly International Mr. Drummer contests in San Francisco from 1981 until it ceased publication in 1999.A Hell Of A Run: Leather Publishing And San Francisco from leatherpage.com, archived at archive.org On September 18, 1990, Clive Platman (Mr. Australia Drummer) presented Tony DeBlase with an Australian version of DeBlase's creation of the leather pride flag; this version incorporated the southern cross, which is from the Australian national flag, with the original design of the leather pride flag. Fritscher's short-story collection Corporal in Charge of Taking Care of Captain O'Malley (Gay Sunshine Press, 1984) was the first collection of leather fiction, and the first collection of fiction from Drummer. The title entry Corporal in Charge was the only play published by editor Winston Leyland in the Lambda Literary Award winner Gay Roots: Twenty Years of Gay Sunshine - An Anthology of Gay History, Sex, Politics & Culture (1991). The magazine was sold in 1986 to Tony DeBlase, who sold it in 1991 to Martijn Bakker, owner of RoB Amsterdam. The last regular print issue of the magazine ‚Äì #214 ‚Äì was published in April 1999. A complete set of this run is at the Leather Archives and Museum.  During publishing hiatus  Fritscher's eyewitness recollections and interviews of Drummer history were published in 2007 as Gay Pioneers: How _Drummer_ Magazine Shaped Gay Popular Culture 1965-1999. A selection of Fritscher's writing in Drummer was published in 2008 as Gay San Francisco: Eyewitness Drummer.

The East Pakistan-India border was opened to allow refugees safe shelter in India. General Tikka Khan of Pakistan army earned the nickname 'Butcher of Bengal' because of the widespread atrocities he committed. The Indian government repeatedly appealed to the international community, but failing to elicit any response, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on 27 March 1971 expressed full support of her government for the independence struggle of the people of East Pakistan. The Indian leadership under Prime Minister Gandhi quickly decided that it was more effective to end the genocide by taking armed action against Pakistan than to simply give refuge to those who made it across to refugee camps. Exiled East Pakistan army officers and members of the Indian Intelligence immediately started using these camps for recruitment and training of Mukti Bahini guerrillas. The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) launched a pre-emptive strike on Indian Air Force bases on 3 December 1971. The attack was modelled on the Israeli Air Force's Operation Focus during the Six-Day War, and intended to neutralise the Indian Air Force planes on the ground. The strike was seen by India as an open act of unprovoked aggression. This marked the official start of the Indo-Pakistani War. Six Indian corps were involved in the liberation of East Pakistan. They were supported by nearly three brigades of Mukti Bahini fighting alongside them, and many more fighting irregularly. This was far superior to the Pakistani army of three divisions. The Indians quickly overran the country, selectively engaging or bypassing lightly defended strongholds. Pakistani forces were unable to effectively counter the Indian attack, as they had been deployed in small units around the border to counter guerrilla attacks by the Mukti Bahini.Indian Army after Independence by Maj KC Praval 1993 Lancer, p. 317 Unable to defend Dacca, the Pakistanis surrendered on 16 December 1971.

Contract definition  A swap agreement in which one party makes payments based on a set rate, either fixed or variable, while the other party makes payments based on the return of an underlying asset, which includes both the income it generates and any capital gains. In partial return reverse swaps, the underlying asset, referred to as the reference asset, is usually a stock or portfolio of stocks. The reference asset is sold to the buyer, with half (or some other percentage) of the return owned by the party receiving the agreed rate of payment, which is usually in the form of a note payable. Partial return reverse swaps allow the selling party to gain liquidity often through the use of algorithmic trading platforms that use technologies such as Stealth Technology and volume-seeking algorithms to more efficiently manage large blocks of stock while avoiding the risks of inside information. Sellers gain liquidity and buffering against any complications with inside information. Buyers effectively are able to purchase stock at a discount to market, for a private-to-public equities arbitrage opportunity. These swaps are considered to be exotic, but are growing in popularity. Investors like swaps like this because they get the benefit of a large exposure with a minimal or no cash outlay., Investopedia.  Advantage  The PRRS allows one party (party A) to derive the economic benefit of owning an asset without having to keep that asset on its balance sheet, and allows the other (party B, which does transfer that asset to its balance sheet) to buy protection against loss in its value. TRORS can be categorised as a type of credit derivative, although the product combines both market risk and credit risk, and so is not a pure credit derivative. Users Hedge funds are using Partial Return Reverse Swaps to obtain leverage on the Reference Assets: they can receive the return of the asset, typically from an issuer or insider (which has a funding cost advantage), without having to put out the cash to buy the Asset. They usually post a smaller amount of collateral upfront, thus obtaining leverage. The term \\"Partial Return Reverse Swap\\" was first used in London by Taylor Moffitt of Holydean and later in his doctoral student writings. It was first practiced by fund management companies such as Greenridge Capital, as en effort to streamline a cluster of separate transactions often used together into one derivative swap agreement. These came out of small hedge funds and private investors doing private-to-public equities arbitrage.Febles, C.

The other area is the mushroom body. Several morphological classes of neurons in the lateral horn receive olfactory information through the projection neurons. In lateral horn, axons of pheromone-sensitive projection neurons are segregated from the axons of plant odor-sensitive projection neurons. In addition, the dendrites of lateral horn neurons are restricted to one of these two zones, suggesting that pheromones and plant odors are processed separately in the lateral horn. Lateral horn neurons responsive to non-pheromonal odors arborize widely in the lateral horn, possibly integrating information from a large number of projection neurons (even if the projection neurons themselves project only to specific regions of the lateral horn). Intracellular recordings from lateral horn neurons show that many of these neurons respond broadly to odors. Responses in these neurons are synchronized to odor-evoked oscillations, and depend on odor concentration.  Physiology  The olfactory receptor neurons in the antenna and maxillary palps project into the olfactory lobes of the insect brain, which in turn project the higher order processing centers, the lateral horn or the mushroom bodies. The lateral horn has vague boundaries in the brain but is bordered by the ends of the branching of projecting neurons in the lateral protocerebrum. There are at least 10 morphological classes of lateral horn neurons. This system is highly conserved throughout the insect world. Insects need an area that integrates olfactory information because they use olfaction as their primary means of gaining information about their world. They must assign a \\"valence\\" (attraction or aversion behavior) to important odors like poisonous food (aversion), mates (attraction) or colony members (situational). This response is usually base on if the scent is pleasant or unpleasant to the animal. The lateral horn is the brain region that accomplishes this olfactory information integration. It coordinates behaviors innate (instinctual) behaviors with certain odors. The antennal lobe has two types of neurons that synapse with the olfactory receptor neurons in the antennae and maxillary palps, the local interneurons and projection neurons. The projection neurons can excite or inhibit action potentials in the mushroom body or lateral horn to which they project. They project to the mushroom body is a random fashion but are very stereotyped in their projections to the lateral horn, making it easier to study in some ways.  Learned olfactory response  While generally the lateral horn is said to be responsible for innate behavioral responses to olfactory stimuli and the mushroom bodies is responsible for learned behavior we now have a growing body of evidence that cross-talk between the two regions which means the true nature is more complicated than that. When an insect encounters an odor to which it has no innate or learned response associated (an unconditioned stimulus), the signals are sent down the projecting neurons to the Kenyon cells of the mushroom bodies. Kenyon cells (among other things) regulates \\"memory acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval of short- and long-term memories\\". While the reason is not currently known, the same projecting neurons that synapse with these Kenyon cells also synapse with the cells in the lateral horn. This provides further evidence of a more complicated connection between the lateral horn and learned behaviors. Cross-talk between the lateral lobe and the mushroom bodies adds flexibility to learned and innate behavioral responses. An odor may be associated with an attractive behavior, leading most insects of a species to move towards the source of that odor, yet some individuals may move away from that odor because of a past negative encounter with it. So the learned behavioral signal from the mushroom bodies can overrule the innate behavior signal emanating from the lateral horn. Conversely, the innate behavioral signal from the lateral horn can also overrule the learned behavior signal from the mushroom bodies. For example, the integration of learned and innate behavioral responses is especially important in social insects such as honeybees. Honey bees use pheromones and specific body movements to communicate with other members of the hive. Bees learn what flower odors are associated with good sources of nectar (leading to the proboscis extension response behavior) but if they are exposed to the sting alarm pheromone, sent by other bees, while learning which flowers scents are associated with the most food their learning is impaired. This is because the \\"stop\\" behavior associated with the sting alarm pheromone is an innate response mediated by the lateral horn which is strong enough to overrule the learned feeding behavior.  Sexual dimorphism  Male and female insects have drastically different behavioral responses when encountering pheromones of the opposite or same sex; thus, the neurophysiology there must be a difference between the two sexes. Because the lateral horn is associated with the integration of odors resulting in stereotyped behaviors we would expect to see a physical difference between male and female lateral horns, and we do. There is sex-specific wiring that initiates sex-specific cell clusters in the insect brain when they are exposed to sex pheromones. A good example of this is the fact that the male drosophila's lateral horn is 1% larger than females of the same species. The male lateral horn has abundant connections with the projecting neurons that come from the DA1, VA1lm and VL2a glomeruli of the antenal lobe (all of which are also larger in males). Each of these glomeruli are associated with the specific olfactory neurons that pick up pheromones. In moths the male-specific projecting pheromone-processing neurons innervate with glomeruli outside of the macroglomerular complex of the antennal lobe. Other studies in drosophila found that it is not just the neurons responsible for incoming information that are sexually dimorphic but also the lateral horn neurons that are sending information to the rest of the fly. The lateral horn neurons that synapse with the ventral nerve cord are dimorphic in their structure and respond to the drosophila sex pheromone cVA.

(12 October 2010) \\"When the guns fell silent\\", Haaretz. Retrieved on 8 September 2011. ATA specialized in work clothes and uniforms, reflecting the Zionist and socialist ideology of the time.[ Factory production spanned every aspect of garment-making, from thread manufacture to sewing and packaging.[ The name of the factory was invented by Hebrew novelist, S.Y. Agnon. ATA is an acronym for the Hebrew words \\"Arigei Totzeret Artzeinu\\" ‚Äì \\"fabrics manufactured in our land\\". In the 1960s, Israeli fashion designer Lola Beer Ebner designed a line of fashionable dresses in bright colors for ATA at the request of Moller's widow. In the 1980s, ATA closed down and a residential neighborhood was built on the site of its factory. In the early years of the state, Ruth Dayan, wife of Moshe Dayan, founded Maskit, a fashion and decorative arts house that helped to create jobs for new immigrants while preserving the Jewish ethnic crafts of various communities living in Israel. In 1955, Dayan met fashion designer Finy Leitersdorf, who designed clothes and accessories for Maskit for 15 years. The two collaborated on a joint exhibit of Maskit designs at the Dizengoff Museum (today the Tel Aviv Museum). Maskit produced textiles, clothing, objets d‚Äôart and jewelry. In 1956, Lea Gottlieb founded Gottex, a high-fashion beachwear and swimwear company that became a leading exporter of designer bathing suits. Israeli fashion has been worn by some of the world's most famous women, among them Jackie Kennedy, Princess Diana, Katharine Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor and Sarah Jessica Parker.[ Beyonce and Lady Gaga have worn gowns with a metallic bodice design by Alon Livne, and Beyonce commissioned Livne to create her wardrobe for her Mrs. Carter Show World Tour in 2013. Livne has also designed outfits for the Hunger Games film series. Maskit which closed in 1994, reopened in 2013 with the support of billionaire industrialist Stef Wertheimer and took part in Moscow's Mercedes Benz Fashion Week that year. Israeli fashion week In 2011, Tel Aviv hosted its first Fashion Week since the 1980s with Italian designer Roberto Cavalli as a guest of honor. In 2015, at the third Tel Aviv Fashion Week, 21 Israeli designers presented their creations to an audience of 24,000 that included 100 members of the international press, dozens of retailers and local celebrities.

The derailed train fouled the adjacent line and a train heading in the opposite direction then collided with it. There were at 65 injured among the approximately 250 people on board each of the two trains. Metro- North reported damages at $18.5 million. Accident At 18:01 local time (22:01 UTC), a Metro-North Railroad passenger train from Grand Central Terminal, New York City to Union Station, New Haven, Connecticut derailed between the Fairfield Metro and Bridgeport stations. The derailed train, 8 cars, came to rest foul of the track used by trains traveling in the opposite direction and was hit by a train traveling on that track. The engineer of the second train applied emergency brakes and was able to slow from 70 mph to 23 mph before the collision occurred. Both of the involved trains consisted of Kawasaki M8 railcars, which first entered service in 2011 and were still being delivered at the time of the accident. There were about 250 people on each of the two trains. The crash blocked both tracks in use ‚Äì two others were out of service for maintenance ‚Äì resulting in Amtrak canceling its Northeast Corridor service between New York and Boston, Massachusetts. This was the first major accident on any of the MTA commuter rail systems in more than a decade, and it is also the first involving the M8 railcars. Injuries The injured were taken to hospitals in Bridgeport, Connecticut. St. Vincent Medical Center reported 46 people were treated there, with six being admitted in stable condition. Bridgeport Hospital said 26 people were treated there, of whom three were admitted, two in critical condition and one in stable condition. As of the morning of May 19, nine people still were hospitalized, with one in critical condition. The NTSB report states that there were 65 injuries, of which 53 were minor and 12 serious. Cleanup Metro-North crews work to rebuild tracks As of 8 a.m. May 19, thirteen cars had been removed and the remaining three were expected to be removed by the early afternoon. By 4 p.m., all the cars were removed, and were moved to the Metro-North rail yard in Bridgeport. Effect on regional transportation Amtrak service between New York and Boston was suspended indefinitely, and Metro-North service also experienced problems. There was no train service at the Fairfield Metro, Fairfield, or Southport stations on Monday, May 20. A bus link transported those that would have taken the train to Westport, where a limited westward service was scheduled for the morning and eastward from Westport in the evening. A shuttle train was put into service to run about every 20 minutes between New Haven and Bridgeport as well as an express bus shuttle service from Bridgeport to Stamford, and regular train connections to Grand Central Terminal. A limited number of Metro-North and Amtrak trains began to run between New York and New Haven during the afternoon of Tuesday, May 21. Full service resumed on Wednesday, May 22. Investigation NTSB staff inspects wreckage NTSB investigation team meets with experts in Fairfield An investigation was opened by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). A broken rail was under initial investigation as a potential cause of the accident, although it may also have been damaged during the accident sequence. The NTSB sent a portion of the track to a laboratory for analysis of a fracture and foul play was ruled out. The total investigation may take up to ten days. About of track was damaged, along with wires and signals. An inspection two days before the crash revealed vertical movement of the track system around an insulated rail joint due to insufficient ballast. Metro North said that this problem was deemed not serious enough to require immediate repair. In April, a cracked joint bar was repaired in the same area of track. The final NTSB report was issued on October 28, 2014. It states that the cause was broken compromise joint bars (used to join two different sizes of rail). The joint bars, in this case, were found to have fractured and broken causing the rail joint to break completely and causing the derailment. It was also discovered that inspections of the area had noticed in the days before the accident that there was insufficient ballast under the joint area causing the joint to flex repeatedly as well as an excessive mismatch in railhead height. This combination caused the failure from fatigue cracking. The report also points out that Metro-North's inspection procedures were somewhat insufficient, in that inspections were performed from a hi-rail vehicle traveling on a center track, while the inspectors had to examine four tracks at once. From the inspector's point of view, they would be unable to see all parts of the track due to distance issues. There were also issues with inspections being rushed to prevent delaying trains and deferred maintenance.

Description TRS was a design for an unmanned robotic spacecraft designed to be capable of remote payload observation and boosting or de-orbiting another spacecraft, and it was developed to potentially re- boost the Skylab space station to a higher orbit. After Skylab 4, the third manned mission to Skylab, plans were made to boost the station into a higher orbit to extend its service life or to de-orbit it into a remote ocean area. A remotely controlled booster rocket was to be carried up in the Space Shuttle's third mission. Astronaut Jack R. Lousma described the remote booster as \\"as big as a truck\\" and requiring a control system able to match the circular motion of the Skylab docking port.http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/LousmaJR/LousmaJR_3-15-10.htm The core of TRS was a propulsion system that could accommodate additional fuel modules. It had a 24 nozzle 6-axis control thruster system to support Space rendezvous, docking, and orienting the spacecraft. Other options for launching TRS were Titan III or Atlas Agena. Some launch options might have required two launches. Martin Marietta proposed the Titan III for launching TRS. The Titan IIIC could carry 29, 600 lbs to low Earth orbit. History The TRS was ordered in October 1977 to be ready for use in late 1979. The TRS had two major possible uses, to either re-boost or de-orbit Skylab. The decision whether to use TRS was planned to be made in 1979. Although TRS was initiated in 1977, it made use of developments in tele-operation going back to the 1960s. In addition, another reason for its selection was the long-term use for task in general including \\"payload survey, stabilization, retrieval and delivery missions, recovery and re-use capability..\\" The TRS project was overseen by the NASA Marshall Spaceflight Center. Because of delays in STS-1, the first shuttle launch, Lousma and Fred Haise were reassigned to the second shuttle mission. NASA expected that the Shuttle would be ready by 1979, and Skylab would not re-enter until the early 1980s. Another factor was that, in 1975, it was decided not to launch a second Skylab (Skylab B); this gave a boost to Skylab re-use plans. As it was, the Shuttle was not ready until the early 1980s, and Skylab's orbit decayed in 1979. Lousma and Haise's mission was canceled when NASA realized that STS-1 would not be early enough before the station's reentry. Missions Although the TRS in development was focused on Skylab boosting, it was thought it could be used for other satellites. The original missions was to save Skylab from re-entering, thus preserving it for future use such as the core of a new space station.

Thruster systems and boost rockets There was a triple group of attitude (direction) thrusters on each of the spacecraft's eight corners. Each thruster was intended to produce a thrust of 2.25 to 4.5-kilograms (5 to 10-pounds) These thrusters would be used for leaving the Shuttle's payload bay and for rendezvous and docking with Skylab. For the Skylab boost or de-orbit, the TRS would have four strap-on boosters each with 680 kg (1,500 Ib.) of hydrazine rocket fuel. This was a modular design, and the TRS could also be used with 2-strap on boosters if the mission, if it only needed that amount. In other words, the TRS was designed for use with 4 boosters, but it was also intended it could also use 2 for example. Control systems The aft flight deck of the Shuttle Orbiter Vehicle The TRS had its own computing and control systems, or it would be controlled by a crewman in the Shuttle Orbiter vehicle.

Career Born in Lewisham, London, Sam Steward made his professional boxing debut in January 1922 with a decision over Rube Painter. After winning most of his first 24 fights he was stopped in the tenth round by Billy Bird in July 1924. He had a significant win in December 1925 when he stopped former British featherweight champion Mike Honeyman in the seventh round. In March 1927 he beat lightweight champion of the Netherlands Battling van Dijk and later that year beat both Ernie Izzard and Jack Hyams. He started 1928 with wins over George Rose, Auguste Gyde, and another defeat of Hyams in a title eliminator, before facing Ernie Rice in September for the British lightweight title vacated by Harry Mason, with Steward's Sporting Life belt also at stake. Steward knocked Rice out in the twelfth round to become British champion. He rounded off the year with a draw against former French champion Lucien Vinez and a win over future Dutch champion Jan Scheffers. He started 1929 with two wins, including a points decision over Irish champion Billy Gilmore, but suffered a defeat at the end of January to former amateur champion Fred Webster in what was the latter's third professional fight. In May, Webster got a shot at Steward's British title at the Royal Albert Hall and again won on points to take the title in what was only his fifth pro fight. Steward was undefeated during the next two years, which included two further wins over Gyde and a draw with Johnny Curley. A fight with Rose in 1930 was agreed as an eliminator for the British title but fell through after failure between their managers to agree on a venue, leading to the BBBofC no longer considering Steward an official title contender. In September 1931 he lost a decision to Dick Stubbings. The two met again two months later, the fight this time ending in a draw. Steward lost to Jack Hudson in December and was then out of the ring for almost four years before making a comeback in October 1935 against Bert Francis, retiring in the sixth round. He beat Billy Reynolds in January 1936 before losing his final fight in March that year to Fred Bullions.

Espinosa appears regularly on Colombian television, and also runs the restaurants Leo Cocina y Cava and Misia. Her restaurant Leo Cocina y Cava was ranked in 2007 as one of the top 82 restaurants in the world by Conde Nast Traveller and has been awarded in 2014 and 2015 as one of the best restaurants in Colombia according to S. Pellegrino list of Latin Americas's 50 Best Restaurants. Being a prominent landmark, known by celebrating the national cuisine through its menu, Leo Cocina y Cava is a must for visitors and travellers. Leo, has managed to refine tradition, memory and creativity. Her culinary proposal claims Colombian native flavours, combining contemporary art with field research, anthropological insight and immersion in different geographical locations country. In 2008 her vocation for gastronomic research led her to materialise the Leo Espinosa Foundation which aims to creates development initiatives in rural communities by strengthening culinary traditions, nutrition and food security. Her current culinary proposal BIOMA-CYCLE focuses on the study through research, development and innovation in the diverse ecosystems in the Colombian territory. In each biome, she and her staff work with biologists, farmers and producers to make way for local products cuisine that recreates Colombia's collective memory. Personal life and family Leonor was born on January 12, 1963 in Cartago, Valle del Cauca, Colombia. She is the second of six children of Juan Antonio Espinosa and Josefina De la Ossa de Espinosa, originally from Sinc√©, a municipality located in the Colombian Caribbean region. These roots have printed the character and personality of Leonor, exerting a huge influence on her culinary proposal. Leonor grew up and lived most of her youth in Cartagena, Bol√≠var, where she studied Economics and Fine Arts. Later, she devoted herself to marketing and advertising, achieving significant recognition in various agencies in Bogota during the 90's. Since 1998, Leonor decided to take her passion for arts to the culinary field through research and experiential learning of techniques, preparations and traditional ingredients of her country. Her only daughter, Laura Hernandez Espinosa, studied International Relations and is a professional sommelier, Corporate Social Responsibility expert and MA in Development Studies with emphasis on food security. Laura is currently a business partner in various business ventures and also heads Espinosa's FUNLEO foundation. Career and restaurants Originally, Espinosa trained in economics and subsequently, in advertising and fine arts. She began to use food as a means to express creativity, and took a position at the Bogot√° restaurant Claroscuro, before being finally able to open her own restaurant, Leo Cocina y Cava, in 2007. Her signature style, developed at Leo Cocina y Cava, is the use of traditional ingredients (many of them unknown in popular cuisine) that are part of the cultural fiber of disenfranchised indigenous, afro-descendant and peasant communities of Colombia. Espinosa does not restrict herself to any of the eight culinary regions of the country, but blends them all 'capturing authentic flavours while adding a modern twist and classy presentation'. This fusion, she credits, in part, to her upbringing in Cartagena, which, with its mix of Spanish, African and native Indian cultures, Espinosa considers to be the 'birthplace of Colombian cuisine'. In 2008, The New York Times wrote that Espinosa's 'culinary experiments are both delicious and peculiar'. Leo Cocina y Cava was chosen by Conde Nast Traveller magazine as one of its 82 best restaurants in the world, and, subsequently, was included as one of the 105 best dining experiences in the world by National Geographic Traveler, in early 2010. Starting in June, 2015, Espinosa opened her latest casual concept, Misia, located a few steps from the National Museum where honours Colombian flavours. Espinosa has supported government efforts to promote Colombia as a 'gastronomy tourism destination' at overseas events in Spain and Washington, D.C. The Colombian Ambassador to the United Kingdom has described her as the chef that 'whets the appetite' for Colombian cuisine. FUNLEO foundation Espinosa established the Leo Espinosa Foundation, or FUNLEO, which is managed by her daughter Laura, with the aim of 'the preservation of Colombia's food traditions while highlighting sustainable practices and local production'. This assists Colombia's afro-descendat, indigenous and peasant communities, by helping them to develop and market their traditional crops and ingredients. The FUNLEO motto is 'Gastronomy for Development' and, as Espinosa explains: > \\"We try to develop the local food, not just the cuisine: our attention is > not focused only in the kitchen, but also in resources, local products from > these rural communities that have lost, shall we say, a place within > Colombian agriculture.\\" Espinosa sees both a cultural and economic value in the country's 'unique identity': 'Once we develop our gastronomic potential from the farm, once we promote and market our resources and crops, Colombia can become the new gastronomic capital of the world.' On 8 March 2013, FUNLEO partnered with Oxfam to work on the GROW sustainable food production campaign in Colombia, among other development projects held by international cooperation agencies as USAID.

Since it was founded in 1787, the women in Sierra Leone have been a major influence in the political and economic development of the nation. Sierra Leonean women face extreme gender inequality. They experience high levels of poverty, violence, and exclusion. Nevertheless, they have also played an important role in the education system, founding schools and colleges, with some such as Hannah Benka-Coker being honoured with the erection of a statue for her contributions and Lati Hyde-Forster, first woman to graduate from Fourah Bay College being honored with a doctor of civil laws degree by the University of Sierra Leone. Early history (1787‚Äì1900) Madam Lehbu, queen of Upper Gaura in 1891. With the establishment of the Province of Freedom in 1787, a Sherbro known as Queen Yamacouba was a signatory to the treaty of 1787 which ceded the land to the British. After the destruction of the Province of Freedom in 1789 and the establishment of Freetown and the Colony of Sierra Leone in 1792, in the 1792 elections in Freetown, all heads of Nova Scotian Settler households could vote and one-third were ethnic African women.Simon Schama, Rough Crossings, (2006), p. 374, The majority of the ancestors of the Sierra Leone Creole people were repatriated women who were of African American, Jamaican Maroon, Igbo, Bacongo, and Yoruba extraction. Creole households in Freetown were different from traditional African ethnic groups in Sierra Leone in that women had property rights and economic freedom and qualified as professionals such as lawyers and doctors in the early twentieth century. This independence gave women the freedom to travel. As they were financially independent, they were able to divorce to improve their lives economically. From 1830, the women in Sierra Leone were well known for their trading of non-slave-related items. A notable Liberated African woman trader of the period was Betsy Carew who had married a butcher, Thomas, and sold meat to the army. The Creole female traders were Christian. Creole women traded along the entirety of the West Coast expanding both their trade and spreading the Christian religion. However, by 1900 European companies began to dominate trade and the Creoles moved to other professions such as medicine and teaching. In 1878, Madam Yoko became the Queen of Kpaa Mende Seneghum, which had become one of the largest political alliances within the interior. She also went to war against smaller tribes to increase her holdings. In 1898 she supported the British during a rebellion, which also allowed her to expand her holdings. At the time of her death in 1906, her confederacy had become so large it had to be divided into 15 chiefdoms. T J. Alldridge the first commissioner of Sierra Leone reported signing peace treaties with two women chiefs in 1889. 1900‚Äì1970 Creole woman dressed in Fante attire on her wedding day In the city of Freetown, before World War One a woman's position was decided on either class or ethnicity. The Creole people were the dominant ethnic group, with some having access to a better education, the wealthier families had their daughters sent to British finishing schools. The majority of Creole women however fell into the lower classes and their education usually did not go beyond elementary school level in a similar vein to their male counterparts of the same class. In 1915, Adelaide Casely-Hayford played an important part regarding women's rights in Freetown giving a lecture on \\"The rights of Women and Christian Marriage\\". In 1923 she founded the \\"Girls Industrial and Technical Training School\\" with the aim to make women self-sufficient economically. In 1930 women were given the right to vote, according to local lawyer J. C. Zizer this could be attributed to the numbers of women who now worked in the civil service where their employment terms were equal to their male counterparts. In 1938, Constance Cummings-John was the first woman in Africa to be elected to a municipal council and she was the first woman to be elected Mayor of Freetown. Her actions led to the formation of the Sierra Leone Market Women's Union and the Washerwoman's Union. In 1952 she founded the Sierra Leone women's movement as well as a newspaper. She founded the Eleanor Roosevelt Preparatory School for Girls and funded it from the proceeds of her quarrying business. In 1943, Frances Wright was called to the bar, becoming the first female lawyer in Sierra Leone, she was also given an appointment by the government as a magistrate. She was a legal adviser to the British High Commission in Freetown and was considered a champion of women's rights. In 1957, four women ran for parliament: Patience Richards, Constance Cummings-John, Ellen G.A. Caulker and Mrs. C.T. Williams. Cummings-John and Richards both won their bids but their party filed electoral petitions against them, preventing them from taking their seats. Two female candidates stood for parliamentary seats in 1967: Yema Catherine Williams and Julie Keturah Kayode. In the 1973 general election Nancy Steele and Ester Lily Coker stood for election as independent candidates. By now Sierra Leone had become a one-party state and their campaigns were unsuccessful. 1978 saw Nancy Steele as the sole woman to stand for parliament in the general election. 1970 - 1990 In 1970, out of the 81 chiefdoms in Sierra Leone, 10 were led by women. In 1989, UNICEF reported that on average a woman in Sierra Leone worked up to 16 hours a day and that the majority were surviving on just one meal per day. There was a maternal mortality rate of 70% primarily from infections and malnutrition. 1990 - 2000 A woman in a Sierra Leone village. During the civil war(1991‚Äì2002), it is estimated that 33% of human rights violations were perpetrated against women. A report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission stated that thousands of women and girls were abducted from their homes and suffered physical-, sexual- and psychological abuse, including rape and forced pregnancy. Many of them were subject to servitude, slavery and forced cannibalism while others were drugged, tortured and murdered. Sierra Leonean women and girls who endured forced pregnancies and gave birth to children by their abusers faced severe social consequences, including social isolation. A number of women and girls became soldiers with the Revelutionary United Front (RUF) during the Civil War. During the war, a group women organized founded the Sierra Leone Women's Movement for Peace, and using peaceful protests attempted to mediate peace between the warring factions. 2000 - present On June 14, 2007, the Parliament of Sierra Leone passed three laws which made wife-beating illegal, allowing women to inherit property and to protect women from forced marriage. However, in 2014, 63% of women aged 15‚Äì49 still held the belief that male partners were justified in hitting and beating their female partners under certain circumstances. The 2007 Domestic Violence Act is rarely enforced as survivors are required to submit a medical report to the police. The majority of women in Sierra Leone cannot afford to pay the medical examination fee nor can they afford the cost of a lawyer to represent them. Many women in the rural areas of Sierra Leone still are not aware that domestic violence is a crime or of their rights. In 2012, 10,000 Sierra Leonean men participated in a project called Husband School where they learned about gender equality, domestic violence, reproductive health, female genital mutilation and family planning. Husband School is organized by United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Fambul Initiative Network for Equality Sierra Leone (FINE-SL). Attendance is enforced by local Paramount Chiefs. The adoption of Registration of Customary Marriages and Divorce Act made 18 the legal age for marriage. Prior to this, there was no minimum age for marriage nor was consent from both parties a prerequisite. In rural Sierra Leone, it was not uncommon for girls under the age of 13 to be given in marriage to elderly men. The law aims to protect women and girls from forced marriage as well as physical, sexual and financial abuse. Reproductive rights in Sierra Leone Women in Sierra Leone have extremely limited reproductive rights. Until 2007, women and girls could still be given in marriage by their families without their consent. Sierra Leone has one of the world's highest maternal and infant mortality rates. Contraception is used by 16% of adult women in Sierra Leone and 7.8% of teenage girls. In 2013, Sierra Leone had the 7th highest teen pregnancy rate in the world. 38% of Sierra Leonean women aged 20‚Äì24 had given birth to their first baby before the age of 18. Teenage pregnancy is a major contributing factor to Sierra Leone's high maternal mortality rate as teenage mothers have a 40%-60% risk of dying in childbed. Babies born to teenage mothers have a 50% higher risk of being stillborn or dying shortly after birth than babies born to mothers over the age of 20. Abortion is illegal in Sierra Leone under any circumstances. President Ernest Bai Koroma refused to sign the 2015 Safe Abortion Act. Unsafe abortions account for 10% of maternal deaths. Excluding Sierra Leone Creole women who do not practice or engage in female genital mutilation, 9 out of 10 girls and women in Sierra Leone have undergone female genital mutilation, often as part of the traditional Bundu or Bondu initiation ceremony into the Sande society. Generally, Sierra Leonean women have a positive view of female genital mutilation. Two-thirds of girls and women undergo the practice between ages 5 and 14.

Released in 1999, it was one of the first Christian first person shooter games, and led to the release of other medieval/ancient FPS games of the same style. Plot The game takes place in a world allegorical to the spiritual aspects of the human heart. The player represents a Christian who enters his own heart to do battle with spiritual forces of temptation and to become a true 'Saint of Virtue.' Gameplay The game features four levels, each representing a spiritual obstacle to the player's journey towards becoming a 'Saint of Virtue.' Enemies - floating masks representative of negative moral choices - appear frequently in the game, and must be destroyed using the Sword of the Spirit, which fires blue bolts. Players can pick up power-ups like the Shield of Faith, which reduces the damage taken by enemies, and \\"Spiritual health,\\" which boosts the player's health bar. Saints of Virtue Gameplay Discontinuation After an extended period of time supporting the game, Shine Studios decided to discontinue the game in 2014 at the same time that the website (http://www.saintsofvirtue.com/) was set to expire. The game is no longer available for purchase digitally, and finding a CD version of the game is becoming increasingly difficult.https://web.archive.org/web/20141218082838/http://saintsofvirtue.com/ Official website (archived from the original) References Category:First- person shooters Category:1999 video games Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Christian video games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Saints of Virtue"},{"id":"39420872","text":"Jack Leroy Cooper (September 18, 1888 - January 12, 1970) was the first African-American radio disc jockey, described as \\"the undisputed patriarch of black radio in the United States.\\" In 2012, he was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame. Biography He was born in Memphis, Tennessee, one of ten children of William and Lavina Cooper. He left home at the age of ten to work in Cincinnati, Ohio, and in his teens was a successful boxer and semi- professional baseball player. By 1905, he was working in vaudeville on the Theater Owners Booking Association (TOBA) circuit as a singer and dancer, and started writing and producing sketches and stage shows, soon running his own touring troupe with his first wife. He managed at least two theaters for TOBA, and began writing for newspapers in Memphis and Indianapolis. After moving to Chicago around 1920, he began writing theater reviews for the Chicago Defender, while attempting to break into the new radio industry as a performer.\\"Chicago's Radio Voice, Jack Cooper\\", at African American Registry. Retrieved 20 May 2014 While working for the Defender in Washington, D.C. he first appeared on radio, writing and performing comic sketches on station WCAP. He returned to Chicago in 1926 and developed a proposal for a new show, The All-Negro Hour, which premiered on WSBC on November 3, 1929. The show was initially broadcast on a weekly basis, and contained live music and comedy sketches, but Cooper gradually modified and expanded its content. It became successful with both listeners and commercial sponsors and continued until 1936. By the mid-1930s, Cooper presented 9 hours each week on WCAP. He was one of the first, if not the first, to broadcast gramophone records, including gospel music and jazz, using his own phonograph. Corey Deitz, \\"A Profile of Radio Personality Jack L. Cooper\\", About.com. Retrieved 20 May 2014 In 1938, he created a new show, Search for Missing Persons, designed to reunite listeners with family members who they had lost contact with. He also pioneered a mobile news team to cover items of interest to Chicago's black community. By 1947, his production company Jack L. Cooper Presentations controlled about 40 hours per week on four different stations in Chicago. He promoted African Americans as presenters, and was among the first to broadcast commentaries on Negro league baseball games and news targeted at the black community. He also actively supported African-American youth organizations including the South Side Boy's Club. In contrast with later DJs like Al Benson, Cooper scrupulously avoided using slang expressions or broadcasting vaudeville or urban blues recordings: > \\"His announcing privileged standard American English over the black > vernacular, a preference he shared with the most affluent and educated > African Americans. In effect, Cooper and his team became the voice of the > urban black bourgeoisie and a symbol of racial uplift.\\" Cooper retired from broadcasting in 1959, and died in Chicago in 1970 at the age of 81. In 1975, a park in the West Pullman neighborhood was officially named Cooper Park in his honor.

Based on the novel by Federico Moccia, was produced by Zeta Cinema, Antena 3 Films, Crab Films and Globomedia film and distributed by Warner Bros., Pictures International Spain. It was shot in Barcelona between October 28 and December 30, 2011.  Plot  Hache (Mario Casas) flies back to Barcelona after spending two years in London, trying to forget his first love and Pollo's (√Ålvaro Cervantes) death, his best friend. His brother picks him up from the airport; after he settles himself in, he sees his bike covered with a sheet. H. takes his bike for a spin and lands in the port where he used to race illegally. As soon as he gets there he receives a call, turns out Katina (Marina Salas) found out through √Ålex (Hache's brother) that he just got back; they both agree to meet at a park. When he arrives at the park, Hache sees Chino (Lucho Fernandez) who tells him that things have changed. Chino invites him to a get-together in a restaurant with their other friends. While waiting sitting on a bench, Katina surprises him and they both sit down for some catch up time. Katina asks Hache if he has missed Babi (Maria Valverde) and tells him that she's seen her, but that she has changed. Hache invites her to the get-together, but Katina declines the invitation and they part ways promising to keep in touch. H. gets on his motorcycle and is seen been followed by Gin (Clara Lago). Gin follows Hache to a gas station and when he goes into the store, she accidentally hits his bike. He picks it up and asks her what has he done to her. While giggling she explains to him that the motorcycle was in front and accidentally fell. She begs him to give her the keys back and threatens to call the police, he turns around and tells her to call the police to see if her situation will get better. He walks to her car and locks all the doors so she can't get in. On their way she asks him his name and he tells her \\"Hache\\" which is the letter \\"H\\" in Spanish. She giggles and questions him what real name is behind the letter, by mentioning a few. He answers with Hugo to which she thinks is an appealing name. On the other hand, when she is asked about hers she says that is Gin derived from Ginebra, to which he laughs and mocks her once more. Days later Katina and Hache go to a club where Daniela (Nerea Camacho) Babi's sister is in and she is drugged having sex. Katina finds her half naked in a bathroom stall. The next morning, Babi wakes up Daniela before her mom sees her and asks her what is wrong with her, after she had received a text at 5:00 AM to go and pick her up, that she got home alone in a taxi almost unconsciously, and that she won't cover up for her anymore. Daniela is seen remembering that along her taxi Hache was riding his motorcycle. Daniela tells her that Hache is back and that he rode his bike along the taxi that she was in and that he had been the one to send Babi the text. That night Hache picks Gin up for a date, while Babi is seen caressing her tattoo that she got which is Hache's initial. Hache takes Gin to a place very high in the city and they both end up making love. They go out to eat with Luque (Ferr√°n Vilajosana) and Katina, while this last one receives a call Hache notices Serpiente (Antonio Vel√°zquez) with Pollo's bike. Hache furiously goes towards Serpiente and asks him why he has Pollo's motorcycle. Serpiente defies inferring that for Hache to get back the motorcycle he has to race him. A brawl breaks out but is immediately stopped by Gin and company. The night of the premiere of the television show, Gin is ready to perform when Hache tells her that there is something that he must do first. While she sings, Hache goes to a party where he reunites with Babi. She takes him to the house she always dreamed it was hers and where they made love the first time, they end up making love on the sand. Meanwhile, Gin finishes her performance and goes on to look for Hache. While walking she hears a woman and a man having sex, she opened the door and notices that it wasn't Hache. She shyly and quietly closes the door and keeps walking, she hears some laughs from another door, she knocks and is one of the top bosses of the TV show. They let her in and tell her that Hache is with them. When she doesn't see him she tells them that she will go and they don't let her, then they try to rape her. Hache ends things with Babi \\"for the better\\" and goes to look for Gin. When he gets to the after party of the premier of the show, other dancers tell him that they saw her walk through the corridors of the dressing rooms. When he gets there he hears screams and he sees that Gin is about to be raped. He starts punching the men and yells at Gin to leave. When he's done, he goes to look for Gin and sees her walking away. Gin asks Hache where he's been, and in with his silence she knew it all. She walks away, breaking ties. Hache, in a state of immense pain, races off on his motorcycle and Katina tries to stop him. Hache arrives at the race to face off against Serpiente for Pollo's motorcycle. In the end of the race each rider exchanges motorcycles. Hache finds closure in Pollo's death, and with one final hallucination of him, rides the motorcycle into the water. Weeks pass, Gin has a photography exhibition and all the pictures revolve around Hache. Babi's mother tells their father it's over due to his infidelity. Daniela, Babi and their mother go to Daniela's first doctor's appointment. In another scene Katina is seen happy with Luque. Hache is shown at the exhibition and realizes that Gin has known him from before, and that she has been taking pictures of him for a long time. Hache goes to see her and she tells him he can help her 'fix this disaster', and if they work at it that maybe they'll turn out fine. Hache and Gin become a happy couple once again.

It encompasses a museum displaying historic ships and displays about the history of shipping on the Great Lakes and New York state canals, a boat-building program that produces replicas of historic wooden boats, and a foundry producing brass fittings for historic ships and replica ships. History The Center was started by Dr. John Montague, a professor in Buffalo State College's Design Department in 1989. In 2007 Montague retired from the University, turned the popular boat-building classes into a not-for- profit corporation called the Buffalo Maritime Center, and moved it to a downtown location. Over the years it expanded to encompass a foundry producing historical nautical hardware, a research library, and a museum with a growing collection of historic boats, ship models, paintings and artifacts related to the maritime history of the region's Great Lakes and canals. During the last decade it has been housed in various former factory sites in the City of Buffalo. Its newest location, in addition to its Arthur Street location in Buffalo, is part of the Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park, in a new longshed that being developed on the Buffalo waterfront. Projects The volunteer-staffed historic wooden boat building program has produced replica canal boats that are in use at the Flight of Five Locks, in Lockport, New York. In 2019 the Center received funding from the Erie Canal Harbor Development Corp. (ECHDC), a subsidiary of Empire State Development Corporation, to build a replica of the packet boat in which Governor Dewitt Clinton rode when he opened the Erie Canal in 1825. The State of New York committed $4 million construct a new 4,000-square-foot, year-round facility for the Maritime Center in which the historically accurate, 73-foot-long, 10-foot wide historic wooden canal boat will be built by hand by the Centre's volunteers boatbuilders. This new building and boat will closely correspond to the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 marking the 200th anniversary of the ‚ÄúBig Ditch‚Äù. The Center has built a historically accurate mold used by museum members to build their own historically accurate wood-frame canoes.

Eschewing an overtly feminist agenda, these organizations focused on providing better economic support and social services for women in Russia, and lobbied for awareness on women's issues. The organizations differed in their tactics, with some more dedicated to political action than others, but they shared a reluctance to uproot traditional gender norms.  History  In the mid-1980s Mikhail Gorbachev instituted glasnost, allowing greater freedom of speech and organization than ever before in the USSR. This openness generated a burst in women's political action, academic research, and artistic and business ventures.Racioppi and O'Sullivan, Women's Activism, 3. Additionally, women were aware that the new government would offer little assistance with their economic and social struggles. Citizens of the Soviet Union could file complaints and receive redress through the Communist Party, but the post- Soviet government had not developed systems of state recourse.Rebecca Kay, Russian Women and Their Organizations: Gender, Discrimination and Grassroots Women's Organizations, 1991-96 (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2000), 123. Women began to form their own networks of resource sharing and emotional support, which sometimes developed into grassroots organizations.  Focus and tactics  Russian women's grassroots organizations in the 1990s took a variety of forms, focusing on academic study, self-help, raising public awareness, political lobbying, professional development and economic issues.Kay, Russian Women and Their Organizations, 120. Some organizations had very specific aims, while others intended mainly to provide an empathic, supportive women's community. Many groups organized around a particular issue, such as the Committee of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia, which advocated for and educated concerning the rights of soldiers and their families.Ludmila Popkova, \\"Women's Political Activism in Russia: The Case of Samara\\", in Post-Soviet Women Encountering Transitions, ed. Kathleen Kuehnast and Carol Nechemias. (Washington DC: Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 2004), 188. Some organizations formed around particular constituents, such as Tol'ko Mama, a single mothers' support organization, and Aviatrisa, which opposed professional barriers for female aviators.Kay, Russian Women and Their Organizations, 219. Russian grassroots women's organizations shared a commitment to making practical improvements in the lives of women.Rebecca Kay, \\"Meeting the Challenge Together? Russian Grassroots Women's Organizations and the Shortcomings of Western Aid\\", in Post-Soviet Women Encountering Transitions, ed. Kathleen Kuehnast and Carol Nechemias. (Washington DC: Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 2004), 242. The tactics and activities of post-Soviet women's organizations depended on each group's focus and goals. A number engaged in political work, staging protests and directly lobbying representatives. Russian women's organizations presented representatives with petitions, educational materials and proposed amendments to legislative bills.Kay, Russian Women and Their Organizations, 221. As incentive, they sometimes campaigned for politicians who backed policies that they supported.Kay, Russian Women and Their Organizations, 125. Some organizations educated women on their civil rights and provided free legal advice, empowering women through legal agency.Popkova, \\"Women's Political Activism\\", 188. Taruskoe Ob'edinenie Zhenshchin (Association of Women of Tarusa) combated judiciary corruption by gathering many women in court during a woman's hearing, demonstrating that discrimination would be noticed and protested.Kay, Russian Women and Their Organizations, 126. Many women wanted to avoid overtly political tactics. Some organizations acquired monetary and material aid to distribute among members. Several groups launched commercial ventures and job-creation schemes, such as a garment-manufacturing business that allowed disabled women to work from home, to support their organization and constituents. Some economically focused groups, such as Klub Zhenskikh Initsiativ (Club for Women's Initiative) provided members with lists of job openings, skill-training workshops, assistance with job applications and counseling on assertiveness and confidence.Kay, Russian Women and Their Organizations, 223. Community- focused organizations offered crisis support and created spaces for women seeking refuge, information, and connection. Organizations hosted workshops, themed social events and lectures on issues of concern to women.Kay, Russian Women and Their Organizations, 220. They published writings on conditions facing Russian women, in Western or academic journals. Some groups publicized through newspapers, television and radio, but many women distrusted the media. Material written about and by women was rarely published in mainstream media. While censorship had eased by the 1990s, women were aware that editors, who were mostly men, retained tight control over media content. Because women, particularly feminists, were often objectified or negatively portrayed in the media, women had well-founded concerns that editors would distort the material they submitted to reflect negatively on their work. For many organizations, media was crucial to recruitment and consciousness-raising and critical for political leverage, so some groups assigned members to focus expressly on crafting press releases and media strategies.  Funding, fate, and ideological differences  All of this work occurred despite a perpetual lack of resources. The Russian government did not offer funding for women‚Äôs organizations, so women devoted significant energy to seeking office space, equipment and money for salaries. Typically, members volunteered their time and homes, but this could be unsustainable for organizations that were, by nature, populated by women facing financial struggles. A lack of funding led to the dissolution of some organizations.Kay, \\"Meeting the Challenge Together?\\" 245-246. The funding that was available came from international women's funding organizations. This money kept many Russian women's organizations running, but it also caused dissension among groups. Western organizations expected their recipients to pursue Western feminist aims, which seemed irrelevant to many Russian women. To receive international funding, Russian organizations adopted Western feminist language, which bred resentment and allegations of elitism made by the unfunded women's organizations. Funded organizations often inadvertently excluded unpaid activists from their conferences and initiatives. As a result, funding issues could prevent cooperation between women‚Äôs organizations.Kay, \\"Meeting the Challenge Together?\\" 249-251. The goals of Western funders and Russian recipients conflicted because the majority of Russian grassroots women's organizations did not have explicitly feminist aims. Most Russian women associated feminism with Western privilege and, with the exception of those in contact with international funders, seldom used terms such as \\"discrimination, women's rights, or inequality.\\"Kay, \\"Meeting the Challenge Together?\\" 244. Some women's organizations even saw equal gender treatment as a violation of the inherent differences between men and women. Even those who did consider themselves feminists, focused primarily on the immediate issues facing women and believed that \\"pursuing these would be the only means of subsequently convincing members of the value of concepts like equal rights and opportunities.\\" Grassroots organizations concentrated on making improvements in women's lives, not uprooting societal conceptions of gender. For example, it did not bother most Russian women to pursue better conditions via a husband's wage. Careful not to foist a particular brand of emancipation on all women, Russian women's organizations fought less against mainstream views of women and more for women‚Äôs freedom of choice. Though feminism, as defined by the Western tradition, was not their goal, the actions that Russian women took to support themselves and one another often challenged conventional notions of gender and promoted gender equality. By assertively pursuing jobs, demanding acknowledgment for their marketable skills and advocating for state support, women demonstrated traits, such as management, independent decision making, leadership, strategic thinking, that challenged traditional views of Russian women as modest and family-oriented.Kay, \\"Meeting the Challenge Together?\\" 243. Russian culture maintained a very clear, restricted definition of femininity, which did not include political organizing or asserting oneself outside the home. Until women joined grassroots organizations, many saw the impulse to make change as a personal deficiency; whether \\"feminist\\" or not, grassroots organizations showed many women that they were not alone in the pursuit of empowerment in a patriarchal society.Kay, Russian Women and Their Organizations, 213.

Purpose The Sterckshof silver museum is a center for research, expertise and promotion of the silversmith's trade. In 2007 the museum was the first museum to ever win the art history prize of the 's-Hertogenbosch Art & Antiques Fair. Collection The Sterckshof castle was built in neo-Flemish Renaissance style, completed in 1938. The silver museum opened in the castle in 1994 after a major renovation. The museum was about from downtown Antwerp. It was located in the Rivierenhof, one of the city's largest parks. The castle where it was based includes courtyards with a wishing well, a French garden and ruins. The silver collection is extremely varied, covering the period from the 16th century to the present. The artifacts were presented thematically, with techniques, brands, styles and the use of the objects presented in context. The museum displays included domestic and religious artifacts. The museum also included exceptional examples of antique Belgian furniture. Other aspects The museum held silver expertise days and silver Sunday. It organized regular discussions, night classes and tours, and gears custom programs on the theme of silver to schools and groups. There was a functioning silversmith's workshop. The library of the Sterckshof Silver Museum held a unique collection with a focus on Belgian goldsmiths. There was also an extensive collection related to applied arts, as well as descriptions of artifacts, art styles, information about artists, conservation and restoration techniques and specific topics. From 1996 onwards the Sterckshof Silver Museum of the Province of Antwerp gave an annual contract to a Belgian silversmith to make a silver artifact for the museum's collection. The museum and the selected jeweler agreed on the object to be made, which should be characteristic of the artist's oeuvre. It was manufactured entirely or in part in the museum's silver workshop. The museum would publish a small monograph on the artist. In September 2010 Sandra Janssens, formerly a scholarly associate at Musea Brugge, replaced acting director Wim Nys as curator. In 2014 the museum merged with the Antwerp Diamond Museum to form DIVA, which opened in 2018 near the Grote Markt in Antwerp.

The 16th century Reformation created a Church of Scotland, popularly known as the kirk, predominantly Calvinist in doctrine and Presbyterian in structure, to which James VI added a layer of bishops in 1584. While these terms now imply differences in doctrine, in the 17th century Episcopalian meant churches governed by bishops, usually appointed by the monarch; Presbyterian implied rule by Elders, nominated by congregations. By the 1630s, around 90-95% of Scots were members of the church, and despite disagreements on governance, there was general alignment on Calvinist doctrine. In the 17th century, religious disputes were often as much about political principles, due to the assumption 'true religion and true government' were one and the same. Although both nominally Episcopalian, the Church of England was very different in doctrine and religious practice. This meant attempts by Charles I to impose shared canon laws and a new liturgy, led to the National Covenant. The Covenanters gained control of government after the 1638-1639 Bishop's Wars but then broke into factions. Attempts to consolidate their victory led to Scotland's involvement in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and after defeat in the Anglo-Scots War of 1649-1651, incorporation into the English Commonwealth. The 1660 Restoration re-established an Episcopalian structure, but many ministers refused to accept this and held services or conventicles outside the established church. Covenanter risings in 1666 and 1679 led to a more intense phase of persecution known as \\"the Killing Time\\" and ended with the deposition of the Catholic James VII in late 1688. In March 1689, his Protestant daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange were accepted as monarchs and the 1690 Settlement permanently removed bishops. Background John Knox The modern use of Presbyterian or Episcopalian implies differences in both governance and doctrine but this was not the case in the 17th and 18th centuries. Episcopalian structures were governed by bishops, usually appointed by the monarch; Presbyterian implied rule by Elders, nominated by their congregations. Arguments over the role of bishops were as much about politics and the power of the monarch as religious practice. The Protestant Reformation created a Church of Scotland or kirk Presbyterian in structure and governance and predominantly Calvinist in doctrine. The addition of an Episcopalian system in 1584 resulted in a situation where bishops presided over Presbyterian structures, while local lairds or heritors controlled the appointment of clergy in their districts. Tensions between these three power centres drove many of the political and religious conflicts that dominated the 17th century. In 1567, the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots was exiled to England, where she was imprisoned and later executed. She was replaced by her one-year-old son James VI who was brought up as a Protestant; by the 1630s, Catholicism was largely restricted to members of the aristocracy and remote Gaelic-speaking areas of the Highlands and Islands.John Prebble, Culloden (Pimlico: London, 1961), p. 50. 1600 to 1651; Wars of the Three Kingdoms The riots initiated by Jenny Geddes in St Giles Cathedral led to the Bishops' Wars James claimed his authority as monarch and head of the kirk came from God; when he also became King of England in 1603, a unified Church of Scotland and England governed by bishops became the first step in his vision of a centralised, Unionist state. Although both were nominally Episcopalian, they were very different in governance and doctrine; Scottish bishops were doctrinal Calvinists who viewed many Church of England practices as little better than Catholicism. Since Calvinists believed a 'well-ordered' monarchy was part of God's plan, the vast majority of Scots agreed monarchy itself was divinely ordered but disagreed on who held ultimate authority in clerical affairs. The Covenanter view was summarised by Andrew Melville as '...Thair is twa Kings and twa Kingdomes in Scotland... Chryst Jesus the King and this Kingdome the Kirk, whose subject King James the Saxt is.' Royalists tended to be 'traditionalists' in religion and politics but there were many other factors, including nationalist allegiance to the kirk and individual motives were very complex. In 1618, the General Assembly reluctantly approved the Five Articles of Perth; these included forms retained in England but largely abolished in Scotland and were widely resented. When Charles I succeeded James, unfamiliarity with Scotland made him even more reliant on the bishops, especially the Archbishop of St Andrews and prone to sudden decisions. The 1625 Act of Revocation cancelling all grants of land made by the Crown since 1540 was done without consultation and alienated large parts of the Scottish nobility and clergy. The Solemn League and Covenant agreed by English and Scottish Presbyterians in 1643 Despite the small number of Scottish Catholics, fear of 'Popery' remained widespread, partly due to the close cultural and religious links between Scots and French Huguenots. Increasing restrictions by the French state led to a series of Huguenot rebellions, while many Scots also fought in the 1618 to 1648 Thirty Years' War, a religious conflict that caused an estimated 8 million deaths. These concerns were heightened when Charles married Henrietta Maria, a French Catholic and accepting the first Papal envoy since the Reformation. In 1636, John Knox's Book of Discipline was replaced by a new Book of Canons, with the threat of excommunication for anyone who denied the King's supremacy in church matters. When followed in 1637 by a Book of Common Prayer, the result was anger and widespread rioting, said to have been set off with the throwing of a stool by Jenny Geddes during a service in St Giles Cathedral. A perception the kirk itself was under threat prompted representatives from all sections of society to sign a National Covenant on 28 February 1638, objecting to liturgical 'innovations.' Support for the Covenant was widespread except in Aberdeen and Banff, the heartland of Episcopalian resistance for the next 60 years. The Marquess of Argyll and six members of Charles' Privy Council backed the Covenant and in December the General Assembly expelled the bishops and established the Kirk on a full Presbyterian basis. Dunbar, 1650; Scottish defeat led to incorporation into the Commonwealth. The attempt by Charles to impose his authority led to the Bishop's Wars; in 1639, the Covenanters defeated Scottish Royalist forces, followed by an English army in 1640, leaving them in control of Scotland. Lack of money forced Charles to recall the English Parliament, which had been suspended since 1629 and ultimately resulted in the outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642. The Scots remained neutral at first but sent troops to Ulster to support their co-religionists in the Irish Rebellion; the bitterness of this conflict radicalised views in Scotland and Ireland. The Covenanter faction led by Argyll saw religious union with England as the best way to preserve a Presbyterian Kirk and in October 1643, the Solemn League and Covenant agreed a Presbyterian Union in return for Scottish military support. Royalists and moderates in both Scotland and England opposed this on religious and nationalist grounds, as did the religious Independents like Oliver Cromwell who were against any state-ordered church. The Covenanters and their English Presbyterian allies viewed the Independents who dominated the New Model Army as a bigger threat than the Royalists and when Charles surrendered in 1646, they began negotiations to restore him to the English throne. In December 1647, Charles agreed to impose Presbyterianism in England for three years and suppress the Independents but his refusal to take the Covenant himself split the Covenanters into Engagers and Kirk Party fundamentalists or Whiggamores. Defeat in the Second English Civil War resulted in the execution of Charles in January 1649 and the Kirk Party taking control of the General Assembly. In February 1649, the Scots proclaimed Charles II King of Scotland and Great Britain; under the terms of the Treaty of Breda, the Kirk Party agreed to restore Charles to the English throne and in return he accepted the Covenant. Defeats at Dunbar and Worcester resulted with Scotland being incorporated into the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland in 1652. 1651 to 1660: The Commonwealth James Guthrie in 1661 After defeat in 1651, the kirk split into two factions. Over two-thirds of the ministry supported the Resolution of December 1650 re-admitting Royalists and Engagers and were known as 'Resolutioners.' 'Protestors' were largely former Kirk Party fundamentalists or Whiggamores who blamed defeat on compromise with 'malignants.' Differences between the two were both religious and political, including church government, religious toleration and the role of law in a godly society. Following the events of 1648-51, Cromwell decided the only way forward was to eliminate the power of the Scottish landed elite and the kirk. The Terms of Incorporation published on 12 February 1652 made a new Council of Scotland responsible for regulating church affairs and allowed freedom of worship for all Protestant sects. Since Presbyterianism was no longer the state religion, kirk sessions and synods functioned as before but its edicts were not enforced by civil penalties. For religious and political reasons, Presbyterians were hostile to sects like the Congregationalists or Quakers because they advocated separation of church and state. Apart from a small number of Protestors known as Separatists, the vast majority of the kirk could not accept these changes and Scotland was incorporated into the Commonwealth without further consultation on 21 April 1652. Contests for control of individual presbyteries made the split increasingly bitter and in July 1653 each faction held its own General Assembly in Edinburgh. The English military commander in Scotland Robert Lilburne used the excuse of Resolutioner church services praying for the success of Glencairn's insurrection to dissolve both sessions. No further Assemblies were held until 1690, the Resolutioner majority instead meeting in informal 'Consultations' and Protestors holding field assemblies or Conventicles outside Resolutioner-controlled kirk structures. James Sharp, Resolutioner, later Archbishop of St Andrews, murdered in 1679 When the Protectorate was established in 1654, Lord Broghill the head of the Council of State for Scotland summarised his dilemma; 'the Resolutioners love Charles Stuart and hate us, while the Protesters love neither him nor us.' Neither side was willing to co-operate with the Protectorate except in Glasgow where Protestors led by Patrick Gillespie used the authorities in their contest with local Resolutioners. Since the Resolutioners controlled 750 of 900 parishes, Broghill recognised they could not be ignored; his policy was to isolate the 'extreme' elements of both factions and create a new, moderate majority. Broghill accordingly sought to encourage the kirk's internal divisions, such as having Gillespie appointed Principal of Glasgow University against the wishes of the James Guthrie and Warriston-led Protestor majority. The Protectorate authorities effectively became arbitrators between the factions, each of whom appointed representatives to argue their case in London. The repercussions affected the kirk for decades to come. While toleration was not formally extended to either Episcopalians or Catholics, they were largely left alone, although the Quakers were the only non-conformists to establish a presence. Attempts were made to convert the largely Catholic, Gaelic-speaking Highlands and Islands to Presbyterianism, with the first Gaelic catechism published in 1653 and the first Psalm book in 1659. This period was later viewed as very positive for religion, since being barred from politics meant ministers spent more time with their congregations and emphasised preaching that emulated the sects. 1660 to 1685; Restoration and the Killing Time Covenanters in a Glenby Alexander Carse; an illegal field assembly or Conventicle. After the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, Scotland regained control of the kirk, but the Rescissory Act 1661 restored the legal position of 1633. This removed the Covenanter reforms of 1638-1639 although another Act renewed the ability of kirk sessions, presbyteries and synods to impose civil penalties, suggesting some compromise was possible. The restoration of Episcopacy was proclaimed by the Privy Council of Scotland on 6 September 1661. James Sharp, minister of Crail, then in London representing the Resolutioners accepted the position of Archbishop of St. Andrews. He was consecrated along with Robert Leighton as Bishop of Dunblane and soon an entire bench of bishops had been appointed. In 1662, the kirk was restored as the national church, independent sects banned and all office-holders were required to renounce the Covenant; about a third, or around 270 in total, lost their positions. Most occurred in the south-west of Scotland, an area particularly strong in its Covenanting sympathies; some took to preaching in the open fields, or conventicles, which often attracted thousands of worshippers. The government responded by alternating persecution and toleration; in 1663, a Parliamentary Act declared dissenting ministers 'seditious persons' and imposed heavy fines on those who failed to attend the parish churches of the \\"King's curates\\". In 1666 a group of men from Galloway captured the government's local military commander and marched on Edinburgh and were defeated at the Battle of Rullion Green. Around 50 prisoners were taken, while a number of others were arrested; 33 were executed and the rest transported to Barbados. The Rising led to the replacement of the Duke of Rothes as King's Commissioner by John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale who followed a more conciliatory policy. Letters of Indulgence were issued in 1669, 1672 and 1679, allowing evicted ministers to return to their parishes, if they agreed to avoid politics. A number returned but over 150 refused the offer, while many Episcopalians were alienated by the compromise. Pre-1660, Glasgow had been a stronghold of the Protestor faction; in 1670, Robert Leighton was appointed Archbishop of Glasgow in an attempt to bring dissenters back into the kirk. He failed to make progress; this was not simply due to the Protestor resistance but also that of Episcopalians, deriving from the presbytery struggles of the 1650s. This meant a return to persecution; preaching at a conventicle was made punishable by death, while attendance attracted severe sanctions. In 1674, heritors and masters were made responsible for the 'good behaviour' of their tenants and servants; from 1677, this meant posting bonds for those living on their land. In 1678, 3,000 Lowland militia and 6,000 Highlanders, known as the \\"Highland Host\\", were billeted in the Covenanting shires, especially those in the South-West, as a form of punishment. St Giles Kirkyard, Edinburgh, where prisoners were held after the Battle of Bothwell Bridge in 1679 In 1679, a group of Covenanters killed Archbishop Sharp. The incident led to a rising that grew to 5,000 men. They were defeated by forces under James, Duke of Monmouth, the King's illegitimate son, at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge. Two ministers were executed and 250 followers shipped to Barbados, 200 drowning when their ship went down off Orkney. The rebellion eventually led to the fall of Lauderdale, who was replaced by the King's brother, the openly Catholic James, known in Scotland as the Duke of Albany. The dissenters, led by Donald Cargill and Richard Cameron called themselves the Society People, but would be become known after their leader as the Cameronians. Reduced in number, hiding out in the moors, they became increasingly radical. On 22 June 1680, the Sanquhar Declaration was posted in Sanquhar, renouncing Charles II as king. Cameron was killed the next month. Cargill excommunicated the King, Duke of Albany and other royalists at the Torwood Conventicle and his followers now separated themselves from all other Presbyterian ministers. Cargill was captured and executed in May 1681. The government passed a Test Act, forcing every holder of public office to take an oath of non-resistance. Eight Episcopal clergy and James Dalrymple, Lord President of the Court of Session resigned and the leading nobleman Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll was forced into exile. In 1684, the remaining Society People posted an Apologetical Declaration on several market crosses, which informed servants of the government that they pursued the lives of its members at the risk of their own. In response to this new element of outright political sedition, the Scottish Privy Council authorised extrajudicial field executions of those caught in arms or those who refused to swear loyalty to the King. This more intense phase of persecution, later known in Protestant historiography as \\"the Killing Time\\", led to dissenters being summarily executed by the dragoons of James Graham, Laird of Claverhouse or sentenced to transportation or death by Sir George Mackenzie, the Lord Advocate. 1688 to 1700; Glorious Revolution Vaudois Protestants in 1685 fed the perception of a Protestant Europe under threat The Scottish Succession Act of August 1681 confirmed the divine right of kings, the rights of the natural heir 'regardless of religion,' the duty of all to swear allegiance to that king and the independence of the Scottish Crown. It went beyond simply ensuring James's succession to the Scottish throne by explicitly stating the aim was also to make his exclusion from the English throne impossible without '...the fatall and dreadfull consequences of a civil war.' Restoration Scotland, 1660-1690: Royalist Politics, Religion and Ideas; Clare Jackson 2003 P38-54 At the same time, the 1681 Scottish Test Act confirmed the primacy of the kirk; it required all public officials and MPs to swear unconditional loyalty to the King but with the crucial qualifier that they 'promise to uphold the true Protestant religion.' James became King in April 1685 with widespread support in Scotland, despite his Catholicism due to fears of civil war if he were bypassed, while opposition to re-opening past divisions within the kirk helped in the rapid defeat of Argyll's Rising in June 1685. In 1687, James now threatened to do the same by his Letters of Indulgence; these extended 'tolerance' to dissident Presbyterians, many of whom had backed Argyll but excluded the Society People, whose leading minister James Renwick was executed in 1688. He thus alienated his Episcopalian base for little gain, while use of the Royal Prerogative to promote Catholics seemed to go against previous commitments and fed the perception he could not be trusted. It was also badly timed; Scotland in particular had long-standing links with French Huguenots, who were expelled from France under the October 1685 Edict of Fontainebleau. This was followed in 1686 by the killing of some 2,000 Vaudois Protestants; while only a tiny percentage of Scots were practicing Catholics, such events reinforced fears Protestant Europe was threatened by a Catholic counter-reformation. In June 1688, two events turned dissent into a crisis; the birth of James Francis Edward on 10 June created a Catholic heir, excluding James' Protestant daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange. Prosecuting the Seven Bishops seemed to go beyond tolerance for Catholicism and into an assault on the Episcopalian establishment; their acquittal on 30 June destroyed James' political authority. Representatives from the English political class invited William to assume the English throne; when he landed in Brixham on 5 November, James' army deserted him and he left for France on 23 December. William III and Mary II depicted on the ceiling of the Painted Hall, Greenwich In Edinburgh, key Royal officials like the Earl of Perth, Lord Chancellor of Scotland, fled the capital due to rumours of Orange plots. This left a power vacuum and rioters stormed Holyrood Abbey, destroyed its Catholic chapel and damaged the tombs of the Stuart kings; others burnt an effigy of the Pope and took down the heads of executed Covenanters from above the city gates. Order was restored when news came James had gone into exile; while there was little domestic Scottish involvement in the coup, Scots were well represented among those who returned with William, while his invasion force included the Dutch Scots Brigade. Members of the Scottish Privy Council went to London and on 7 January 1689, they asked William to take over the responsibilities of government, pending a Scottish Convention in March. While a large majority of the English Parliament agreed Mary should replace her father, William's demand he be made joint monarch and sole ruler if she died was only narrowly approved. In Scotland, the split within the kirk made William more important because his Calvinism meant Presbyterians saw him as a natural ally, while the Episcopalian minority could only retain control with his support. The Scottish Convention that convened on 14 March in Edinburgh was dominated by the Presbyterians. On 4 April, it passed the Claim of Right and the 'Articles of Grievances', which held James forfeited the Crown by his actions; on 11 May, William and Mary became co- monarchs of Scotland. The kirk's General Assembly meeting in November 1690 was the first since 1654 and even before it convened, over 200 Episcopalian ministers had been removed from their livings. The 1690 Settlement eliminated episcopacy and created two commissions for the south and north of the Tay, which over the next 25 years removed almost two-thirds of all ministers. However, nearly one hundred clergy took advantage of Acts of indulgence in 1693 and 1695 to return to the kirk, while many others were protected by the local gentry. In 1673, Michael Fraser was appointed minister at Daviot and Dunlichty and was still there when he died in 1726, despite being evicted in 1694, as well as joining the 1715 and 1719 Jacobite Risings. Those who remained outside the kirk eventually formed the Reformed Presbyterian Church and the Scottish Episcopal Church. Popular Protestantism Killing Time\\" Scottish Protestantism in the seventeenth century was highly focused on the Bible, which was seen as infallible and the major source of moral authority. In the early part of the century the Genevan translation was commonly used.G. D. Henderson, Religious Life in Seventeenth-Century Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), , pp. 1‚Äì4. In 1611, the Kirk adopted the Authorised King James Version and the first Scots version was printed in Scotland in 1633, but the Geneva Bible continued to be employed into the late seventeenth century.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community, pp. 192‚Äì3. Many Bibles were large, illustrated and highly valuable objects. They often became the subject of superstitions, being used in divination.Henderson, Religious Life in Seventeenth-Century Scotland, p. 12. Family worship was strongly encouraged by the Covenanters. Books of devotion were distributed to encourage the practice and ministers were encouraged to investigate whether this was being carried out.G. D. Henderson, Religious Life in Seventeenth-Century Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), , p. 8. The seventeenth century saw the high-water mark of kirk discipline. Kirk sessions were able to apply religious sanctions, such as excommunication and denial of baptism, to enforce godly behaviour and obedience. In more difficult cases of immoral behaviour they could work with the local magistrate, in a system modelled on that employed in Geneva.R. A. Houston, I. D. Whyte \\"Introduction\\" in R. A. Houston, I. D. Whyte, eds, Scottish Society, 1500‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), , p. 30. Public occasions were treated with mistrust and from the later seventeenth century there were efforts by kirk sessions to stamp out activities such as well-dressing, bonfires, guising, penny weddings and dancing.Houston and Whyte \\"Introduction\\", p. 34. Under an act of 1649, kirk sessions were charged with levying taxes on local heritors for poor relief, rather than relying on voluntary contributions. By the mid- seventeenth century the system had largely been rolled out across the Lowlands, but was limited in the Highlands.O. P. Grell and A. Cunningham, Health Care and Poor Relief in Protestant Europe, 1500‚Äì1700 (London: Routledge, 1997), , p. 37. The system was largely able to cope with general poverty and minor crises, helping the old and infirm to survive and provide life support in periods of downturn at relatively low cost, but was overwhelmed in the major subsistence crisis of the 1690s, known as the seven ill years. The kirk also had a major role in education. Statutes passed in 1616, 1633, 1646 and 1696 established a parish school system,R. A. Houston, I. D. Whyte \\"Introduction\\" in R. A. Houston, I. D. Whyte, eds, Scottish Society, 1500‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), , p. 31. paid for by local heritors and administered by ministers and local presbyteries.. By the late seventeenth century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the Lowlands, but in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas.R. Anderson, \\"The history of Scottish Education pre-1980\\", in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, Scottish Education: Post- Devolution (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 2003), , pp. 219‚Äì28. George Sinclair's Satans Invisible World (1685), one of the many tracts published in Scotland arguing the existence of witchcraft In the seventeenth century the pursuit of witchcraft was largely taken over by the kirk sessions and was often used to attack superstitious and Catholic practices in Scottish society. Most of the accused, some 75 per cent, were women, with over 1,500 executed, and the witch hunt in Scotland has been seen as a means of controlling women. The most intense phase of persecution took place from 1661 to 1662, when over 664 people in four counties were accused of witchcraft. From this point prosecutions began to decline as trials were more tightly controlled by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. B. P. Levack suggests that there may also have been a growing scepticism and with relative peace and stability the economic and social tensions that contributed to accusation may have reduced. There were occasional local outbreaks like that in East Lothian in 1678 and 1697 at Paisley. The last recorded executions were in 1706 and the last trial in 1727. The British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in 1736.B. P. Levack, \\"The decline and end of Scottish witch-hunting\\", in J. Goodare, ed., The Scottish Witch-Hunt in Context (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2002), , pp. 166‚Äì80. Catholicism The numbers of practising Catholics probably continued to reduce in the seventeenth century and the organisation of the Church deteriorated.J. T. Koch, Celtic Culture: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volumes 1‚Äì5 (London: ABC-CLIO, 2006), , pp. 416‚Äì7. Some were to convert to Roman Catholicism, as did John Ogilvie (1569‚Äì1615), who went on to be ordained a priest in 1610, later being hanged for proselytism in Glasgow and often thought of as the only Scottish Catholic martyr of the Reformation era.J. Buckley, F. C. Bauerschmidt, T. Pomplun, eds, The Blackwell Companion to Catholicism (London: John Wiley & Sons, 2010), , p. 164. An Irish Franciscan mission in the 1620s and 1630s claimed large numbers of converts, but these were confined to the Western Isles and had little impact on the mainland.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , pp. 365‚Äì6. A college for the education of Scots clergy was opened at Madrid in 1633, and was afterwards moved to Valladolid. In 1653, the remaining five or six clergy were incorporated under William Ballantine as prefect of the mission.C. G. Herbermann, ed., The Catholic Encyclopedia;: an International Work of Reference on the Constitution, Doctrine, Discipline, and History of the Catholic church; Volume 13 (Appleton, 1912), p. 620. There were a small number of Jesuits active in Strathgrass from the 1670s. The Pope appointed Thomas Nicolson as the first Vicar Apostolic over the mission in 1694 and the situation of Catholicism began to improve. Nicholson divided Scotland into districts, each with its own designated priests and he undertook visitations to ensure the implementation of Papal legislation. In 1700, his Statuta Missionis, which included a code of conduct for priests and laymen, were approved by all the clergy.M. C. C. Mairena, The Restoration of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in Scotland PhD, Catholic University of America, 2008, , pp. 56‚Äì60. By 1703, there were 33 Catholic clergy.

Holloway sees the problem of political activism, in terms of those struggling ‚Äúin-and-against‚Äù the system, as one of continuing to perpetuate capitalism through their commitment to abstract labour. Holloway defines \\"abstract labour\\" as labour which is subordinated exclusively to the demands of the market. He argues that from the Marxist stand-point of ‚Äútwo- fold nature of labour‚Äù or abstract labour and concrete labour, that anti- capitalist struggles should be about concrete doing being against labour, and not a struggle of labour against capital. In this respect it is critical of Leninism, orthodox Marxism and other attempts to address social change either exclusively in terms of socialising the means of production, through the formation of political parties or working within state structures. The books name is derived from the analogy of ice breaking from struggles against capitalism. It sets out 33 theses which also touch upon dialectics, primitive accumulation, sexual dimorphisation and struggles in the global south. The book was published by Pluto Press in 2010.

See Torah im Derech Eretz #Appropriate behaviour and good character. Origins and Interpretations The text in Leviticus Rabbah (known in Hebrew as Vayikra Rabbah) comes to show that in human history, proper behavior preceded the Torah, as written: The Torah was not given during the earliest years of humanity because it was first necessary to have proper preparation in terms of values. This leads to the conclusion that advances in Torah knowledge must never weaken natural morality. In this view, the Torah was given with a background of the moral development that preceded it, with the goal of lifting mankind up to a higher moral level. It comes to say, in a way, that a lack to reach the level for which the Torah is aiming is not a moral lack ‚Äì the nations of the world are required to be ethical, even though they are not required according to Jewish tradition to observe the mitzvot. In Pirkei Avot (3:17) the sages declared, \\"If there is no Derech Eretz there is no Torah, and if there is no Torah there is no Derech Eretz.\\" That is, proper moral behavior must precede the Torah, but after the Torah has been revealed based on the prior existence of proper behavior, a new and higher-level moral code is derived from the Torah. Some explain that the Torah itself does not immediately present all of the mitzvot and their details, since the Book of Bereshit deals almost exclusively with the ethical behavior of Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov without explicitly mentioning mitzvot. This may teach us that proper character traits, especially those related to relationships between people, takes precedence over the religious mandates of the Torah. Another interpretation is that the Torah devotes its entire first book to stories of the forefathers and foremothers, to be used as models for decent behavior, and after having absorbed those, one is ready to go on to the laws and precepts of Jewish life. The lives of the forefathers and foremothers are the examples after which people must pattern their lives in order to become suitable vessels for receiving and internalizing the Torah.

Although Fox exhibited at the Royal Academy, little was recorded about him until 2010, when an oil painting signed A. H. Fox, depicting an unidentified bearded man in civilian dress, which had been found discarded in a waste skip, was put up for sale on the BBC television programme Flog It!. Although the canvas was described as being in good condition (the frame was damaged), it was auctioned for only ¬£40. Other works by Fox have been sold at some of the most prestigious auction houses, including Bonhams. Among his sitters were Francis Aspinal Philips, who was High Sheriff of Radnorshire in 1851, Philips' wife Jane, Sir Edward Watkin, 1st Baronet, MP and various members of the Rymer family, notably Thomas Rymer of Calder Abbey and the Dutton Estate Ribchester (Rymer purchased Calder Abbey for ¬£44,200 in 1885, eleven years after the portrait) and Thomas Harrison Rymer, Esq.

It houses the Sterckshof silver museum of the Province of Antwerp. Built on the site of a much older castle, or great house, the present building is a reconstruction erected in the 1920s. History Sterckshof is about east of the center of Antwerp. It is situated at an altitude of above sea level. From as early as the 13th century the site of the castle was occupied by the fortified \\"Hooftvunder\\" farmhouse, surrounded by a moat. It was probably used to defend a nearby wooden bridge over the Grote Schijn River. In 1523 it was described as a farm with a house, brewery, moat, ponds, fishery, etc. That year it purchased by Gerard Sterck, who erected up picturesque buildings with a castle, towers and turrets, and called it Sterckhof, a name it retains today. Gerards grandson was Guillaume de Berghes, bishop of Antwerp. In Sterck's monument in Antwerp cathedral he is described as a knight, and lord of Busquoy, Wyneghem, Casterl√© and Hooft-Vundere. Sterck was a merchant, banker and secret adviser of the Emperor Charles V. Another owner, Jacob Edelheer, furnished the castle with art collections and scientific collections. Unlike other castles in Antwerp, the Sterckshof was not destroyed during the wars of the 16th and 17th centuries, but it was neglected during a dispute between the heirs after the owner, Jacob van Lemens, died childless in 1664. From 1693 Sterckshof was owned by the Jesuits of Lier, but the castle was damaged or allowed to deteriorate during the war of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748). After the dissolution of the Jesuit Order, the estate was sold in 1776 to the banker Jan Baptist Cogels, who merged it with his Ter Rivieren estate. By the 1880s the buildings, long uninhabited, were no more than ruins. Owned by the province In 1921 the Province of Antwerp bought the Ter Rivieren estate, with the Sterckshof castle, to make it into the current Rivierenhof park. Of the Sterckshof all that was standing was the floor of a tower, the entrance gate and some ramshackle outbuildings. In 1922 the architect JA Van der Gucht submitted plans for reconstruction. Using old pictures and archaeological discoveries, in the 1930s the building rose as an evocative reconstruction. The reconstructed building with its red brick turrets and courtyards is set in formal gardens surrounded by a moat, conveying an impression of the houses of the wealthy in the 16th century. The municipality of Deurne declined to use the building for their town hall. In 1926 the idea of using it for the province's technical department was explored but rejected since the building was not suitable. The idea of using it for a dairy was also rejected. Eventually, in 1934 an Association was founded to established a Museum of Flemish Civilization. The Sterckshof was transferred to the association on 21 May 1938 and it was immediately opened to the public. Joseph De Beer, the honorary curator, moved into the house and began acquiring what became a huge and disparate collection of archaeological, natural history, ethnology and art and crafts objects. From 1951 the state began funding the museum. When De Beer died in February 1953 the original association was liquidated and the castle was taken over by the Province of Antwerp. At first it housed the Province's Sterckshof Museum of Art Crafts, and later the Province's Sterckshof silver museum. The museum's displays covered techniques for working the metal and domestic and religious uses. It also included a silversmith's workshop. The museum exhibited Belgian silver and pewter wares from the 16th to 21st centuries, and also some fine antique furnishings. The museum was unable to expand on the site due to planning restrictions, so was closed in 2014 and merged with the Antwerp Diamond Museum to create the DIVA Museum for Diamonds, Jewellery and Silver, located in Antwerp city centre. After the silver museum moved out, the province put the castle on the market, with an asking price of 4.5 million euros; in 2017 the Flemish government approved 2 million euros in renovation subsidies to sweeten the offer. As of August 2019 a buyer had still not been found.

It was built in 1912 and houses the Evangelical Lutheran Congregation of Johannesburg which was established in 1888 as the Deutsch-Evangelische Gemeinde zu Johannesburg (German-Evangelical Congregation of Johannesburg). The building was designed in the Neo-Romanesque style by the Swiss-born architect Theophile Schaerer . The tall bell tower on a rocky prominence above Twist Street remains a landmark to this day. History The congregation was formed in 1888 after a memorial service had been held on 20 March by the local missionary, Hermann Kuschke, for Kaiser Wilhelm I who had died on 9 March. Two years later the congregation had built a small church on a stand given to them by the South African Republic government. That building served them for twenty-two years. The 'Friedenskirche' which is also known as the Church of Peace of the Evangelical Lutheran Congregation was designed by the Swiss-born architect Theophile SchaererTheophile Schaerer in a Neo-Romanesque manner and includes elements of other classical styles. It was built in 1912 on grounds lent to the German community by the executive of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek in 1895 free of charge.Bruikleen This land was acquired by the church in 1906 from the government of the Transvaal Colony. The church originally had been designed to be built entirely in sandstone coursed rubble masonry. Cost factors resulted in large plain areas to be brick-built, rendered in Tyrolean plaster. The church was inaugurated on 22 September 1912. At that time its position on a rocky prominence, high above Twist Street,Edith Cavell Street surrounded by single and double storey dwellings, made it a striking landmark. A distinction it hasn't quite lost yet in spite of high-rise buildings towering over it.Minutes of Meetings, Congregational Council , 1890 - 1913. In 1958 the building underwent a mayor overhaul entailing repairs and minor alterations. In the process thereof the original oak-carved altar was replaced by a concrete and sandstone one; the former being relegated to the vestry. The ten stained glass windows along the side aisles, telling bible stories, were designed by Elly Holm in 1962 (the two stained glass windows to the apse date from 1932). She also created the larger than life sgraffito on the transept wall, depicting St. John the Baptist, and the ceiling fresco in the vestibule The building is in excellent repair and still serves its purpose. Present Situation For many years the Friedenskirche was at the centre of German cultural life. With the change in the population in Hillbrow beginning in the 1980s the congregation saw a decline in German speaking membership. The vibrant English services attract a growing number of black inner-city residents, coming from all over South Africa and other African countries. The congregation made a conscious decision to be a place of peace and well-being for all the people of its community. The congregation decided to face the challenge of being an inner-city church and launched an Outreach Project in 1998, targeting the disadvantaged residents of Hillbrow, particularly children and youth, with cultural and developmental programmes.

The Sterling Organ Company began making pianos in 1885. By the early 20th century the company had its headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, and operated factories in both Derby and Shelton, Connecticut. In its early years, Sterling produced both pianos and organs, but ceased organ production in favor of the more popular piano after the first couple of decades in business. The company built several different piano names including Mendelssohn, Huntington, Goetz & Co., Richardson and Lohmann. The pianos of this era were known to be very high quality instruments, rivaling many other prominent builders of the day. Although the company manufactured grand pianos, it was mainly well known for high-end uprights, or \\"Cabinet Grand Pianos\\". After the Great Depression, Sterling merged with the Winter Piano Company, and the Sterling name was retained until the 1960s.

A deficit can be created by reducing input/calories consumed (lower food intake, aka dieting). A deficit can also be created by increasing output without a corresponding increase in input. Increased output is created by increasing physical activity, from increased caloric requirements necessary to heal an injury, or from growth. There are also some substances, including Caffeine, which can create a small (3-5%) increase in caloric expenditure, via a variety of pathways that include increasing physical activity levels and increasing Thermogenesis (heat output), and/or by reducing caloric input via appetite suppression. Drugs and herbal treatments creating a more extreme metabolic effect exist; however, they cause extreme increases of heart rate and thermogenesis that can cause death in even very healthy and athletic individuals, and these drugs are not widely sold. As the calories required for energy homeostasis decreases as the organism's mass decreases, if a moderate deficit is maintained eventually a new (lower) weight will be reached and maintained, and the organism will no longer be at caloric deficit. A permanent severe deficit, on the other hand, which contains too few calories to maintain a healthy weight level, will eventually result in starvation and death. To reduce 1 kg of weight, about 7000 kcal deficit is required. Nutritionally complete meal replacements can be used to minimize malnutrition.

The Concession and Agreement outlined a fusion of powers system, which allowed for an overlap of executive, legislative and judicial authority. It provided for a bicameral legislature consisting of a Council and General Assembly. This system was retained in East New Jersey after the 1674 division of New Jersey. A new system was established in West Jersey. On April 15, 1702, the Proprietors of East Jersey and those of West Jersey surrendered the right of government to Queen Anne. Anne's government accepted the surrender and united the two colonies as the Province of New Jersey, a royal colony, establishing a new system of government. The East Jersey government remained in power, however, until the arrival and qualification of the royal governor, Viscount Cornbury. Composition The Provincial Council consisted of six to twelve members, or any even number between six and twelve, appointed by the governor and serving at the pleasure of the Proprietors. Three of six councilors were to be considered a quorum. If the Council consisted of a greater number than six, four would be a quorum, provided that all members had been summoned.The Grants, Concessions and Original Constitutions of the Province of New Jersey, Aaron Leaming and Jacob Spicer; W.

The newspaper continued to be published throughout the American Revolutionary War and into the founding of the United States, its states, and its evolving local governments. The newspaper, which was restarted as the Elizabeth Daily Journal in 1787, was published until January 3, 1992, which was 212 years after it first started. At that time, it was the fourth oldest newspaper published continuously in the United States and the oldest newspaper in New Jersey. The New Jersey Journal was an effective force working toward the unification of sentiment, the awakening of a consciousness of a common purpose, interest, and destiny among the separate revolting colonies, and of a determination to see the war through to its successful conclusion in 1783. Newspapers of that time were more single-minded than the people, and they bore no small share of the burden of arousing and supporting the often discouraged and indifferent public spirit. History The newspaper was founded by Shepard Kollock, who established his press in the village of Chatham, New Jersey during 1779. The New Jersey Journal was the third newspaper that started publication in New Jersey. Kollock's newspaper became a catalyst in the revolution. News of events came directly to the editor from George Washington's headquarters in nearby Morristown, boosting the morale of the troops and their families, and he conducted lively debates about the efforts for independence with those who opposed and supported the cause he championed. During the evacuation of New York in 1783, he moved his press to that city and established the New York Gazetteer, initially published weekly and then three times a week. He also started a newspaper in New Brunswick, New Jersey. In 1787, he relocated and established his last publication location in Elizabethtown and adopted the name of the new location into his original newspaper title. He remained its owner and editor until 1818 when he sold his printing establishment. The Elizabeth Daily Journal, which had advocated for presidents Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe while Kollock was its owner and editor, ceased publication on Friday, January 3, 1992 after 212 years from its original start, the fourth oldest newspaper published continuously in the United States and the oldest newspaper published in New Jersey.Staff. \\"New Jersey Loses Oldest Paper\\", The Palm Beach Post, January 3, 1992.

Goel (born 1970) is an American hedge fund manager. Goel is the managing general partner of Matrix Capital Management, which he co-founded with pioneering investor Paul Ferri in 1999. Goel is also a prot√©g√© of hedge fund manager Julian Robertson. Biography Goel was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and, though he is known primarily as a U.S. equity securities investor, he began his career as a Canadian citizen. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2013. A 1989 graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy and a 1993 graduate of Harvard University, Goel studied international relations and majored in government. After graduating university, he went to work as a financial analyst at Morgan Stanley & Co. in its High Technology Investment Banking division. From 1995 to 1996, he worked as a financial analyst at the multibillion-dollar private equity fund General Atlantic Partners. In 1996, he left General Atlantic to become an analyst and later partner at the failed Tiger Management, where he was mentored by Julian Robertson. Goel then began his own fund, Matrix Capital Management, in 1999. Thus, Goel is counted among the ‚ÄúTiger Cubs,‚Äù a designation for former Tiger Management employees who started successful hedge funds. Investment strategy Like other Tiger alumni, Goel is known for fundamentals-focused growth investing. The time horizons of Goel's investments are typically long-term, and he has been quoted as saying that, when evaluating a stock portfolio's performance, ‚ÄúI think in 10-year terms.‚Äù Goel's investment strategy has been cited as an exemplar both of company-specific microeconomic research and for its use of market analysis, including DeMark Indicators. Goel's hedge fund, Matrix Capital Management, is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and as a result, its investment strategies are a matter of public record. For the past 14 years, Goel's fund has invested in public companies predominantly within the technology, media, telecommunications, and consumer staples sectors. Matrix Capital has even been the subject of a prominent case study at the Harvard Business School. When Goel and Ferri co-founded the fund in 1999, it was arranged that Goel would manage its day-to-day functions. Thus, Matrix Capital is not to be confused with Ferri's separate venture capital firm Matrix Partners, which has made early stage investments in young, private companies over the past 36 years that include Apple, SanDisk, Gilt Groupe, and others. Through Matrix Capital Management's investments, Goel received attention in 2012 for his early support of cloud computing ventures. Goel was quoted as saying these investments were predicated on ‚Äúthe disruptive power of cloud computing across the technology universe‚Äù and that each would be ‚Äúa harbinger for where all software companies will have to go if they want to remain relevant.‚Äù In the case of Rod Drury‚Äôs accounting software company Xero, for instance, Matrix Capital Management purchased approximately 10% of the company. Philanthropy and other affiliations Goel is an active philanthropist and serves on a number of boards at educational institutions and foundations for the arts. A lifelong beneficiary of scholarships and financial aid, he became an advisor for Harvard University's Weatherhead Center for International Affairs (where he studied as an undergraduate) from 2006 to 2008, has been a Trustee of the Meadowbrook School since 2009, and was elected as a Trustee of Phillips Exeter Academy in May 2013. He has also served as a Trustee of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston since 2010, where he and his wife, Stacey, donated a gallery in the museum's New American Wing. Goel currently serves on the board of Directors of Popular, Inc., a publicly traded financial holding company with more than $45 billion in consolidated assets. In 2013, Popular shareholders reelected him by a majority of 98%. Goel and his wife made a $100 million gift to Harvard University in 2019 to fund its arts campus in Allston.

It is situated directly on the Thames Path national trail, north of Greenland Dock, with distinctive timber box \\"lanterns\\" on its roof. History Seventeenth-century maps show that the site had been part of a shipyard from at least 1660 to the north of what is now Greenland Dock (formerly Howland Great Wet Dock). John Randall had taken a lease from the 4th Duke of Bedford in 1760, constructing Randall and Brent's yard alongside the Dock, where some of the largest East Indiamen and warships of the time were built in a private yard. By 1813, maps of the yard show a building in the present location of Odessa Wharf. Shipbuilding in Rotherhithe ‚Äì Greenland Dock & Barnard's Wharf, Stuart Rankin One of the original lintels at Odessa Wharf has been inscribed with the date 1810, which would make it one of the oldest surviving buildings on the Rotherhithe peninsula. \\"Maritime Rotherhithe - History Walk B: Shipyards, Granaries and Wharves\\", Stuart Rankin, p.16 Produced by Southwark Council Views of the Howland Great Dock The Story of Rotherhithe, Stephen Humphrey from the 18th Century show that adjacent to Odessa Wharf, on the opposite side of Randall's Rents, were a series of sawpits, some of which have structures which look like mould lofts, used to store the moulds for forming ships. The age, location, orientation to the pits and its long, thin building form suggest that this may well have been the original use of the building. By 1868, Ordnance Survey maps indicate that the building had been incorporated into a large building, thought to be a granary, on the site now occupied by New Caledonian Wharf. By 1914 the form of the building plan, as shown on historic maps, had changed little, although it went through a series of name changes over time.

The main factory was located in Berlin-Borsigwalde on the Breitenbachstra√üe. As more sites were added, the name changed to Altm√§rkische Kettenwerke.  Founded  Alkett was founded in 1937 as a subsidiary of Rheinmetall-Borsig AG, which in turn was a subsidiary of the government-controlled Reichswerke Hermann G√∂ring. The main facility was sited on the Rota-wagon and Maschinenbau GmbH plants, which had not been in use since 1928.Klaus Schlickeiser: Borsigwalde einst und jetzt, Wohnen und Industrie. S. 590.  Production plants  Alkett workshops on Breitenbachstra√üe Production of the Sturmgesch√ºtz III and Sturmhaubitze 42 at Alkett  Factory I  The site at Breitenbachstra√üe 33-36, the later Plant I, had to be extensively rebuilt. The administrative headquarters were located to the left of the main entrance. The basement housed a canteen for the employees. To the right of the main entrance a fire department was located, along with the workshop, and an electrical substation for supplying the Electric power distribution of 6,000 to 30,000 volts. Behind the administration building were Production Halls 1 through 8.Klaus Schlickeiser: Borsigwalde einst und jetzt, Wohnen und Industrie. S. 592‚Äì593. With the coming of the Second World War increased demand for armored fighting vehicles resulted in a marked ramp-up of production. Alkett obtained a site for manufacturing directly across the street from their main buildings. Located on Breitenbachstra√üe 1-6, the former site of the L√∂wenberg factory, was built Production Halls 9-12. The test area for foreign tank design was located in Hall 12. Here the engineers tested the T-34 and Sherman tanks to draw conclusions for their own production. Other facilities were located at Breitenbachstra√üe 72. The factory on Breitenbachstra√üe was fully sealed and secured from the passage of outside traffic to prevent espionage. Once the war began additional workshops were rented in the vicinity of the Hartung Jachmann AG and a technical department was set up. In addition, access of the yard area to the basement bomb shelter was expanded to allow for use by the civilian population. By 1942, the administration grew so large that between 74 and 86 additional office barracks had to be added on Holzhauser Street. All of these elements were under the name of Factory I.  Factory II  Factory II, also called the \\"Maschinen und Ger√§tebau Tegel\\" (Machinery and Equipment Works), was originally located in Berlin-Tegel near the Borsig plant in Eisenhammerweg.Klaus Schlickeiser: Borsigwalde einst und jetzt, Wohnen und Industrie. S. 596.  Factory III  Factory III (former Altm√§rkische Kettenwerke, Werk III) was in Berlin-Spandau located on Freiheit 16‚Äì17 street.  Production  Panzer III production Altm√§rkischen Kettenwerke performed as designer, manufacturer, and partially exclusive licensee of some of the main armored fighting vehicles of the Wehrmacht. The company was involved in the development, production and modification of the following vehicles: * Panzerkampfwagen II * Panzerkampfwagen III Ausf. F, G, H, J, L * Panzerkampfwagen VIII Maus * Flakpanzer I StuG III, Ausf. G, September 1944 * Sturmgesch√ºtz III Ausf. C, D, E, F, G (the Wehrmacht's most-produced armored fighting vehicle design) * Sturmhaubitze 42 * Sturm-Infanteriegesch√ºtz 33B * Sturmpanzer VI * Nashorn * Panzerj√§ger Renault R 35(f) (modified the structure and armament, did not perform the original production of the vehicle) * Jagdpanzer IV/70(A) (development only, no production) * Sturmpanzer IV (development only, no production) * Hummel (development only, no production) * Wespe (development only, no production) The completed tanks were test driven on Holzhauser Street. Since 10 to 20 new tanks left the factory every day, their appearance was a common feature of the townscape at the time.Klaus Schlickeiser. Borsigwalde past and present, living and industry S. 597 Alkett also repaired damaged tanks that were brought by rail from the front to the plant site. Alkett is the company that Major Alfred Becker worked with, initially in early 1942 to help create self-propelled artillery pieces by use of captured French Lorraine Schlepper ammunition carriers.Restayn, Jean Kommando Becker. German Military Magazine (in German):de:Altm√§rkische Kettenwerke Becker converted these vehicles to carry the 150 mm sFH 18. Becker's later work converting captured French vehicles to carry German weapons was assisted by Alkett, which produced the steel superstructures for the vehicles Becker was modifying in France. Allied air attacks on November 23 and 26, 1943 resulted in the upper floors of the administration building collapsing. The office in the barracks Holzhauser Stra√üe 74-86 burned down completely. Following this raid, plant management shifted part of production to the newly completed halls at Falkirk-Albrechtshof. The November bombing raid had a significant impact on the production of the StuG III. This was an important weapon for the army and Alkett was the major manufacturer. Alkett had produced 255 StuG IIIs in October 1943, but in December the number fell to just 24 vehicles. A conference to discuss alternatives with Adolf Hitler was held on December 6‚Äì7, 1943. It was noted that if production could be shifted to another manufacturer German assault tank production could be sustained. The suggestion was offered of using the Fried. Krupp Grusonwerk AG Magdeburg for assault gun production by taking the StuG III superstructure and mounting it onto the Panzer IV chassis. To make up for the large deficit in this valuable Alkett weapon, the StuG IV received full support and its production at Krupp- Gruson was initiated. Since primary military production was not related to the repair work, it was not essential to relocate the railroad network. By June 1944 Alkett had fully recuperated through setting up a new plant in Falkensee. On October 6, 1944, a third major air raid struck the plant, resulting in the destruction of 80 percent of Warehouses 1 through 5.  Employees  160px Between 3,000 and 4,000 employees worked at the Alkett plants. From 1941 foreign civilian workers from Italy and Belgium were added who had \\"volunteered\\" to work in Germany. They were housed in non-guarded barracks on Holzhauser Street 42-50. The plants also made use of forced laborers. These included Poles and Russian, Yugoslav and Italian prisoners of war. These workers were housed on Dietrich Eckhardt Street, which is now called Gorky Street. In 1943 designer Hugo Kapteina formed a resistance group within the factory. Leaflets were produced, distributed and acts of sabotage were carried out. One technique Kapteina called upon was for welders to use excessive current so that the welds would not hold for long. Kapteina was found out and arrested in 1944. He was executed on April 20, 1945. On the same day senior master Franz Hahne was awarded the Golden Knight's Cross to the War Merit Cross with swords. This was only twice awarded. On April 23, 1945 Soviet troops occupied the Alkett plants.  After the war  In the first months after the end of the war the factory was dismantled by order of the Soviet Military Administration. Since Alkett resided in the French sector of Berlin, as stipulated by the Yalta conference, the Soviets were unable to take everything away. With the portion of the plant that had not been dismantled, the remaining machinery was used for production of much needed everyday items, such as pots, pans and buckets. In early 1948 Alkett resumed work in mechanical engineering, and began receiving ore supplies. In 1953 work halls 1-6 located at 10-12 Breitenbachstra√üe were renamed Alkett GmbH. Work with the welding presses was resumed to produce gears, gear boxes, and stainless steel screws.Klaus Schlickeiser. Borsigwalde past and present, living and industry pp. 602‚Äì603 In the late 1950s the company was re-renamed Alkett Maschinenbau GmbH. In 1966 at the request of the Bundesschatzministerium (Federal Ministry for the Treasury) Alkett was incorporated, as were other West Berlin companies such as Borsig, Schwartzkopff, Typography (Linotype machine) and Fritz Werner machine tools into the German Industrial Equipment Company. The company was now 90% in federal ownership.  References  ;Notes ;Citations ;Bibliography * Crow, Duncan. Armoured fighting vehicles of Germany, World War II.

Administration Maurizio Buscalioni The first director was the Italian astronomer Maurizio Buscalioni, who brought to the observatory equipment modern for its time. The focus was on weather and astrometry observations that included the first systematic measurements of atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity and rainfall. He made astrometric observations to determine legal time and as well as the latitude of the Observatory. Buscalioni worked to establish contacts with the best observatories and astronomers of America and Europe. Buscalioni led the observatory for three years, submitting his final report in January 1894. He left Venezuela soon after with a severe illness and died shortly after arriving back in Italy. Dr. Luis Perez Ugueto With the departure of Buscalioni, the astronomer Armando Blanco assumed direction of the Observatory. He served for the next two years. Blanco officially created the position of deputy director and appointed Dr. Luis Ugueto to be it. In the beginning of this administration there was an Observatory Development Board formed by Agust√≠n Aveledo, Germ√°n Jim√©nez and Henry Lord Boulton. In November 1900, Dr. Ugueto became the Observatory administrator. In spite of economic problems seismographs were installed and observations were carried out of Comet Daniel in 1908 and Halley's Comet in 1910. At the same time, the first astronomy classes were begun and Venezuelan legal time was disseminated for the first time. By 1913 the value of meridian observations for determining the time and the desirability of having a National Meteorological Network was recognized, and expansion and improvement of the observatory building and the street leading to it was begun. However, lack of maintenance affected the astronomical instruments, soon leaving them in poor condition. The successful observation of a total solar eclipse in 1916, in spite of the problems with the instruments, was an important milestone. The eclipse generated such enthusiasm that an ad-hoc committee was formed with the objective to observe it at Tucacas, in Falcon state. The commission greatly helped with the eclipse observations of some international expeditions.Eclipse total de sol que ocurri√≥ el 6 de febrero de ese a√±o. El informe sobre tal evento fue digno del m√°s alto encomio por los observatorios de Derab√≥n y YaleSe tom√≥ el meridiano que pasa por las afueras de Villa de Cura para determinar la Hora Legal de Venezuela, puesto que se encuentra a 4 h y 30 minutos del meridiano de Greenwich, punto de referencia universal. Ugueto served as Director until January 1, 1936. During his long tenure the main achievement was the creation of a network of weather stations across the country. With the availability of weather information, the development of agriculture was improved. A long-time concern of Ugueto was the need for a meridian circle, an indispensable instrument for determining time with high precision. Thirty-five years after his initial application, but still during his administration, this project was finally achieved. Francisco J. Duarte The physicist and mathematician Francisco J. Duarte assumed the directorship in 1936. He made constant requests for funds, but these were routinely rejected and he was unable to obtain modern instruments suitable for astronomical observations. Duarte continued the collections of meteorological data and published annual ephemerides in 1940 and 1941. Eduardo Rohl Starting in 1941, new instruments were ordered through the initiative of new director Eduardo Rohl. The 1950s saw some improvement in the facilities. Funds were obtained for the creation of the Seismological Institute, and Dr. Gunther Fielder of Germany was hired to direct everything related to this activity. In 1956 a building was constructed on \\"Quintana Hill\\" in which is located the Seismological Museum. Part of Dr. Fielder's heritage is the \\"Venezuelan Foundation for Seismological Research¬ª FUNVISIS.Sala de Espera - Venezuela: La tierra tiembla. De visita por el Museo Sismol√≥gico.

Duarte was charged in 1960 with modernizing astronomical facilities in Venezuela using the new instruments. Some were installed at the Cagigal Observatory, but most were eventually erected at a dark site in the Venezuelan Andes.

During the 1870s and early 1880s, the Imperial German Navy had built a number of ironclad warships of various designs. In the mid-1880s, however, dissatisfaction with the s and the rise of the Jeune √âcole doctrine persuaded Leo von Caprivi, then the chief of the Imperial Navy to turn away from capital ship construction in favor of coastal defense ships and torpedo boats.Sondhaus, pp. 160‚Äì165 As a result, the next class of large warships, the , was significantly smaller than the earlier ironclads, and armed with a main battery of only three large- caliber guns. These vessels were intended only for defense of German harbors.Gardiner, pp. 242, 246 Six of them were built between 1888 and 1894.Gr√∂ner, pp. 10‚Äì11 Another two ships of the were built to a modified design between 1892 and 1896. All eight of the ships were heavily modernized between 1898 and 1904; the reconstruction included lengthening the ships and equipping them with new boilers.Gardiner, p. 246 All eight ships were mobilized briefly at the start of World War I in August 1914 as the VI Battle Squadron, though by August 1915, they had all been withdrawn from service and employed in secondary roles.Gardiner & Gray, p. 142 All were stricken from the naval register in 1919 after the end of the war and subsequently discarded; three of the ships, , , and were converted into merchant ships and served in this capacity throughout the 1920s. The rest were broken up for scrap by the early 1920s.Gr√∂ner, pp. 10‚Äì12 These coastal defense ships turned out to be a temporary diversion for the German fleet. In 1888, before any of the Siegfrieds or Odins had been laid down, Caprivi was selected to replace Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who had been forced out of the position by the new Kaiser, Wilhelm II; Caprivi in turn was replaced by Vice Admiral Alexander von Monts.Sondhaus, p. 177 Monts, a veteran naval officer, opposed Caprivi's policy on coastal defense, and instead proposed building four new s. These ships replaced what would have been the last two of the coastal defenders for which Caprivi had called.Sondhaus, pp. 179‚Äì180 This set Germany on the trend of building large, ocean-going battleships for the next two decades.Gardiner, pp. 247‚Äì249Gardiner & Gray, pp. 145‚Äì149 Indeed, Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz characterized the period the Siegfried and Odin classes were built, up to the passage of the First Naval Law in 1898, as the \\"wasted decade\\". { \\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"float: right; margin: 0 0 0 1em;\\" + Key - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Armament  The number and type of the primary armament - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Armor  The thickness of the belt armor - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Displacement  Ship displacement at full combat load - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Propulsion  Number of shafts, type of propulsion system, and top speed generated - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Service  The dates work began and finished on the ship and its ultimate fate - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Laid down  The date the keel began to be assembled - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Commissioned  The date the ship was commissioned } __TOC__ Siegfried class at anchor In 1883, when General Leo von Caprivi became the chief of the Imperial Navy, he discarded the fleet policy of his predecessor, Albrecht von Stosch, in favor of creating a fleet that could defend Germany's coast. To that end, he called for the construction of new coastal defense ships that were larger than the unsuccessful s but smaller than the s. They were to be sufficiently seaworthy to permit use in the North Sea, with armament and armor strong enough to allow them to engage larger, foreign battleships. Caprivi requested ten such vessels, though only eight would be built, the first six to the Siegfried design.Sondhaus, p. 165 The six Siegfried class ships were used in fleet maneuvers throughout the 1890s,Sondhaus, pp. 194‚Äì195, 221 until they were reconstructed at the end of the decade. The modernization included re- boilering and lengthening, both of which improved the ships' speed. They were mobilized at the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but remained on active service for only a year; in August 1915, they were withdrawn and used for secondary roles, primarily as barracks ships. All of the ships, save , were scrapped after the end of the war. Frithjof was converted into a merchant ship instead, and operated until 1930, when she too was broken up for scrap. { \\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Siegfried class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  Service ! - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  rowspan=\\"6\\"  3 √ó gunsGr√∂ner, p. 11  rowspan=\\"6\\"  rowspan=\\"6\\"  Gr√∂ner, p. 10  rowspan=\\"6\\"  2 shafts, 2 triple expansion engines,  1888  29 April 1890  Scrapped, 1920 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\"  1890  1 April 1892  Scrapped, 1921 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  23 February 1893  Scuttled, 1930 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  1891  7 April 1894  Scrapped, 1921 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  1890  28 October 1893  Ran aground and sunk, 1919 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  1891  2 October 1894  Scrapped, 1919 } Odin class Painting of in 1902 The Odin class, the seventh and eighth of Caprivi's proposed ten coastal defenders, was a modified version of the Siegfried design; the primary differences were a slightly improved armor layout, a second funnel, and two military masts.

The great northern tilefish is a slow-growing and long-lived species, which has four stages of life. After hatching from eggs, the larvae are found in plankton. As they grow into juveniles, the individuals seek shelter until finding or making their own burrows. As adults, the tilefish continue to expand their burrows in the sediment throughout their lives. The diet of the larvae is unknown, but presumed to consist of zooplankton; juveniles and adults feed upon various benthic invertebrates, crustaceans, and fish. After reaching sexual maturity between 5 and 7 years of age, females lay eggs throughout the mating season for the male to fertilize, with each female laying an average of 2.3 million eggs. The great northern tilefish has been subject to regulation to prevent overfishing. Regulations include catch limits and gear restrictions to prevent damage to the species' habitat and population. The result of these regulations has been a rebounding of the population, which led to an increase in the 2012 catch limit in the southern part of the Atlantic seaboard. Taxonomy and naming The species was first discovered in 1879, when a cod trawler caught some by chance while working off of the coast of Massachusetts.Goodwin, G; Bogert, C M; Gilliard, E; Coates, C W; \\"The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Animal Life\\", Odham Books, 1961. Vol. 13, pp. 1539‚Äì1540. The species was named Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps by George Brown Goode and Tarleton Hoffman Bean in 1896 in their seminal work Oceanic Ichthyology, A Treatise on the Deep-Sea and Pelagic Fishes of the World, from a sample collected southeast of Nomans Land, Massachusetts.Goode, G. B.; Bean, T. H. (1896) Oceanic Ichthyology, A Treatise on the Deep-Sea and Pelagic Fishes of the World, Based Chiefly upon the Collections Made by the Steamers Blake, Albatross, and Fish Hawk in the Northwestern Atlantic, caption for Pl. LXXV. 265. Retrieved from the NOAA Photographic Library, July 24, 2007 The discovery of the fish was announced earlier in the journal Science (see \\"The Tile-Fish\\" in Science, Vol. 5. No. 101 (January 9, 1885), pages 29‚Äì30). Its genus is Lopholatilus, which is in the family Malacanthidae, commonly known as tilefish. The Malacanthidae are part of the Percoidea, a suborder of the order Perciformes.Myers, P.; Espinosa, R.; Parr, C. S.; Jones, T.; Hammond, G. S.; Dewey, T. A. (2006). Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps blue tilefish. The Animal Diversity Web (online). Accessed July 24, 2007 L. chamaeleonticeps gained its moniker \\"great northern tilefish\\" from its prodigious size and its discovery at relatively high latitudes for a member of the Malacanthidae. When used in cooking, the species is generally referred to as the \\"golden tile\\", for the large yellow spots across its blue-green back and lighter-yellow or pink sides. The species is distinguished from other members of its large family by a prominent crest on its head. Characteristics Adult The great northern tilefish is the largest species of the family Malacanthidae; male specimens can grow up to fork length (FL) and females to FL. During their first four years of life, they grow at a rate of typically after which their rate of growth slows down. They reach sexual maturity once they are between in length Various studies have shown that the life expectancy of fish that survive into adulthood is in the range of 25 to 35 years. The back of the fish is iridescent and blue-green in color, with many yellow and gold spots. The belly is white. The head color changes from a light blue to a pinkish mix during spawning season. Specimens have a tone of blue under their eyes. Their pectoral fins are a light tone of sepia, and the margin of the anal fin is a purplish-blue color. Lengths at age suggest that males grow faster than females, but the observed ages showed that females live longer. The largest male specimen was long and about 20 years old, the largest female specimen was 39 years old and reached a total length of . The oldest tilefish recorded to date was a 46-year-old female specimen that reached a length of , while the oldest recorded male specimen was and 29 years.  Behavior  Juvenile tilefish The great northern tilefish has a unique burrowing behavior and habitat preference. In addition to their unique habitat choice, golden tilefish display sexually dimorphic growth with males growing to larger sizes and are behaviorally dominant over their female counterparts. The great northern tilefish is not a migratory fish; it stays in one local area that fits its needs all year round. Seasonal migration may occur with changes in the water temperatures around the Nantucket Shoals and Georges Bank during the winter or spring, but this theory has no definitive evidence. A competing theory suggests that tilefish may instead reduce their activity or hibernate within their burrows during times of cold temperatures. The lifecycle of the great northern tilefish begins as an egg, which is nonadhesive and buoyant. Eggs that are artificially fertilized and kept in an environment between hatch after 40 hours. The hatching larvae are around in length. The larvae are found in plankton from July to September in the Middle Atlantic Bight. The transitional phase between larvae and juveniles is unknown, but juveniles either find or excavate a burrow or place of shelter to inhabit. After they grow in size and become sexually active, the adults spawn throughout the mating season to propagate the species. The tilefish's construction and expansion of burrows are the subject of ongoing research to better understand the behavior of the species. Whether the tilefish begins the construction a burrow or if it expands an existing one is unknown. The burrow is presumed to be lengthened and widened by the tilefish as it continues to grow and age. Tilefish typically are found in their own burrows, with sharing exhibited with male and female pairs. Tilefish tend to congregate in their habitat, with their burrows in relative proximity to each other; the species does not form schools. The grouping of tilefish can be as dense as 13,000 burrows per km2 off the southern U.S. Atlantic coast, but 1,600 burrows per km2 were reported in inhabited areas of the Gulf of Mexico and 2,500 burrows per km2 near the Hudson Canyon. Tilefish burrows also provide a home for various species that live in the area, such as mollusks and other crustaceans.  Predation  The predators of the tilefish are poorly understood. Juveniles can be preyed upon by dogfish or conger eels, which are prey for adult tilefish. Sharks have been presumed be predators of the tilefish, but no evidence is seen of free-swimming tilefish being attacked by dusky sharks or sandbar sharks. The one listed predator for the tilefish is the goosefish. The function of the tilefish's burrows was predator avoidance, but this has been disputed because chased tilefish try to outswim their predators rather than entering their burrows to seek shelter. Diet The diet of tilefish larvae is unknown, but it is believed to be zooplankton. Juvenile and adults are omnivorous with a preference for small benthic invertebrates, with a staple being crabs and lobster. Great northern tilefish also consume bivalve molluscs, salps, squid, Atlantic dogfish, mackrel, hagfish, and herring. Human trash is also eaten, including potato peels and meat bones. They also eat other tilefish in a display of cannibalistism. Reproduction Juvenile specimen The fish spawn during the early spring to the late fall, from March to November. Peak spawning occurs during May to September in Mid-Atlantic Bight regions, differences in temperatures affect the breeding time. In U.S waters further south, the spawning season occurs from April to June. Males grow faster and reach larger sizes than females. Fishing pressure may cause males to spawn at smaller sizes, and at younger ages. The spawning behavior of the species is unknown, but it is presumed to be polygamous with the female choosing the male. Pair bonding has been exhibited, which is assumed to be a behavior that serves to insure fertilization of the eggs during the season. It was estimated that females can spawn about every four days for a total of 34 times per season. Depending on the size, the average female may lay 195,000 ‚Äì 8 million eggs during spawning season, with the average female laying 2.3 million eggs. In response to the overfishing, the tilefish's age of sexual maturity has been dramatically affected. From 1978 to 1982, the median age of sexual maturity in males declined by 2.5 years from 7.1 to 4.6 years. This resulted in the males becoming sexually mature before females. In 2008, the median age of sexual maturity in males had risen to 5.9 years. Females of the species also exhibit low reproductive ability after becoming sexually mature, instead increasing with age and their sexual maturity has varied to a lesser extent than the male population across the years. A small percentage of golden tilefish is known to be intersexual, having opposite nonfunctional sex tissues. Male tilefish specimens also inhibited a cavity that came from ovarian tissue and sperm sinuses. Tilefish of both genders in the Gulf of Mexico exhibited a higher rate of intersex characteristics than other populations. Distribution and habitat Tilefish, making a burrow inside a clay deposit. The species is abundant in the United States territorial waters of the Atlantic Ocean extending north into Nantucket Shoals and Georges Bank and moving south along the East Coast of the United States and into the Gulf of Mexico along the continental shelf. Although Great northern tilefish are reported to be most abundant between deep at ., the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report differs, by stating that the species lives at the bottom of the ocean where they burrow into the sediment, between deep where the temperature ranges from . The great northern tilefish is known to dig and occupy burrows along the outer continental shelf, and on the flanks of submarine canyons in malleable clay substrate. Due to their long life expectancy, slow growth, complex breeding system, and habitat specificity, they are vulnerable to overexploitation, and they are susceptible to mass mortality events due to cold-water intrusion and overfishing. Their abundance is strongly correlated with presence of silt-clay substrate, because the soft clay enables the fish to create the burrow itself by simply digging away the clay substrate.Panama City Laboratory, Life History and Habitat Requirements of Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps in the Gulf of Mexico, NOAA, November 10, 2001. Retrieved 13 July, 2007. The minimum temperature threshold for golden tilefish is . Temperature observations and measurements are obtained by interpolated observations. Temperature plots indicate that 9 ¬∞C is the norm for the area around Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. Population and conservation status Decline in age, size during sexual maturity in great northern tilefish population is occurring throughout the continental shelf. In the mid-Atlantic Bight, smaller sizes and younger ages at maturity were observed in 2008, compared to the survey data from the 1980s where recorded measurements showed a larger population. The recent estimates of age and size at maturity in the southern U.S. waters were smaller than those previously reported in the late 1980s. There were also very few juvenile tilefish seen in tilefish population surveys in the southern U.S. waters in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Declines in population could negatively affect other organisms in their surrounding environment due to the fact that without tilefish, the burrows underneath the continental shelf will disappear, therefore putting an end to the symbiotic relationship with other organisms that use the tunnels as shelter. Fishing regulations include catch limits and gear restrictions to prevent damage to the species habitat and population. There are different gear restrictions for commercial and recreational fishers. In 2007, regulations were imposed to reduce the harvesting by one third, as a response to overfishing in the South Atlantic. The South Atlantic catch limit was later increased in October 2012 as a response to the increased population. The 2013 limits in the southern U.S. Atlantic waters for the species, measured in gutted weight, were 405,971 pounds for longline and 135,324 pounds for hook-and-line fishing. The current South Atlantic catch limits as of 2019 are 248,805 pounds for longline and 82,935 pounds for hook-and-line fishing.

Context The station was built by the Great Northern Railway (GNR) as part of their Leen Valley Extension which enabled trains to run from Nottingham Victoria to Shirebrook North via Sutton- in-Ashfield Town, Skegby for Stanton Hill, Pleasley East and Shirebrook South. History The Leen Valley Extension started at Kirkby South Junction where it left the Great Central Main Line. It was opened northwards in stages, with passenger services as far as Skegby commencing with some fanfare on 4 April 1898. The line through Pleasley station opened for mineral traffic as far as Shirebrook Colliery on 26 November 1900. Passenger services were extended north of Skegby to Pleasley and Shirebrook (later renamed \\"Shirebrook South\\") on 1 November 1901. The high embankment through the village of Shirebrook which completed the Leen Valley Extension by connecting the GNR's Shirebrook (later \\"Shirebrook South\\") and the LD&ECR;'s Langwith Junction (later \\"Shirebrook North\\") was opened on 29 May 1901. The passenger service then settled down to five trains per day plying between Shirebrook (later Shirebrook South) and Nottingham Victoria, with two extra on Wednesdays and Saturdays. There was no Sunday service. The GCR took the LD&ECR; over in 1907, so after that date The Leen Valley extension joined the Great Central at both ends. Nevertheless, at least until 1922 local passenger trains ran North from Nottingham Victoria and terminated at Shirebrook (later Shirebrook South), despite Shirebrook North being only a mile further on. To modern eyes this appears like running trains along the East Coast Main line from Edinburgh, terminating at Finsbury Park instead of Kings Cross. It is probably explained by the fact that services from Sheffield Midland via Spinkhill and Langwith Junction (Shirebrook North) continued to the Midland Railway station at Mansfield, giving an onward connection to Nottingham Midland. From 1925 trains started running the last mile to Shirebrook North, but the writing was already on the wall. The railways in these parts were built primarily to carry coal. Local passenger services were typically loss-making and got in the way of freight traffic. The Shirebrook North - Shirebrook South - Nottingham Victoria service was withdrawn on 14 September 1931. The line remained open for six purposes: *coal *through freight services *local freight services *diversions if the GCML was overloaded or under repair, *special trains, notably for football matches(see below) and enthusiasts, and *Summer excursions. Pleasley East closed for local goods on 2 October 1963. Summer weekend excursions to places such as Skegness continued to call at Pleasley East until October 1963. At which point the station became redundant and closed completely. The GCML closed North of Nottingham in September 1966, so diversions also ended, but a last hurrah was a sleeping car service from Marylebone to Glasgow which passed through from 1962 to 1964. Collieries closed or rationalised production, for example Pleasley Colliery joined underground with Shirebrook Colliery and sent its coal to the surface that way. Through freight dwindled or went by other routes, so fewer trains passed through the Pleasley East site. A Stephenson Locomotive Society \\"Farewell\\" railtour traversed the line on 4 May 1968.Railtour Files: via sixbellsjunction The line was closed on 27 May 1968 and has since been lifted.

La Fague, Cap-Haitien The wildlife of Haiti is important to the country because of its biodiversity. According to the World Conservation Monitoring Centre, Haiti is considered to be \\"one of the most biologically significant countries of the West Indies\\". With an estimated 5,600 plant species on the island of Hispaniola, some of which only occur in Haiti, 36% are considered as endemic to the island. A mountainous area country, it is situated in the western three-eighths of Hispaniola and shares a border with the Dominican Republic. There are nine life zones, from low desert to high cloud forests, as well as four mountain ranges, and hundreds of rivers and streams and the coral reefs in the seas that surround the islands. Issues of environmental damage, expanding population, deforesting and erosion are of concern; less than 2% of the original forest remains on account of deforestation. This degradation is traced from the 17th century to 19th century starting with the French colonization of the Haiti and population explosion during the 20th century and for the purpose of forestry and sugar- related industries, degraded the forests. and the environment. Geography The features of the island terrain (generally mountainous) varies from Caribbean Sea elevation of to the highest point on the Chaine de la Selle mountain of . The land use distribution reported is of arable land 36.04%, permanent crops 10.09% and others 53.87%, with an irrigated area of 97,000 ha. The Massif de la Hotte (of 2.5 million years age) is part of the far- southwestern mountain range of the island, has a few vestiges of cloud forests (within the Macaya National Park) and are known for endemic plant and reptile species. The gray-crowned palm-tanager is one of the rare endemic bird species here. Climate is tropical; mountains in the east cut off trade winds and cause semiarid conditions in some areas. The average annual precipitation is which varies with topography and wind direction. The island is in the center of the hurricane belt and hence experiences severe storms from June to October; occasional floods and earthquakes also take place, and in some years droughts are also experienced. Protected areas Pinus occidentalis The regions of extreme biodiversity in Haiti have been brought under legal law (under legal enactment of June 23, 1983) of protection and preservation of the ecology and the biodiversity of the identified areas. These regions are declared as national parks, and specifically the two large gazetted national parks are the Morne La Visite National Park as part of the Massif de La Selle (mountain range) and Pic Macaya National Park in the Massif de la Hotte (hill massif) is also an integral part. Apart from the major aspect of conservation of plants and animals in general, the park administration are also entrusted with the task of preserving the endangered species of mammals such as Plagiodontia aedium and Solenodon paradoxus. In addition there are two other parks the Pine Forest National Park, in the eastern Massif de la Selle, and the Historic Citadel National Park in the Massif du Nord. In these four parks no hunting, illegal logging and transfer of land for any development activity are allowed; however, enforcement of the laws has not been stringent due inadequate funding for maintenance and security arrangements. However, visitors are allowed to see the wild life, the water falls and the general rain forest vistas in these parks. While the four national parks protect an area of , there are proposals on the anvil to bring 18 more areas of the country under protective cover which encompass an area of another . La Visite National Park, Haiti The La Visite National Park, Haiti, covers an area of (established in 1983) along the ridge of the Massive de la selle range between the hill peaks of Morne d‚ÄôEnfer (elevation ) and Morne Kadenau () with the highest mountain of Pick Cabalo lying within the park rising to an elevation . It is at distance of to the south of Port-au-Prince. According to the floristic survey carried out by Walter S. Judd of the University of Florida, the plants recorded in the park are 326 species of tracheophytes that includes 262 species of angiosperms, 76 species of mosses, 19 species of liverworts. In addition, the vascular plant species reported are 112 of which 32% are endemic species to Haiti. Reforestation programme has been undertaken since 2011 under which 300,000 seedlings were under planting in memory of the 300,000 people who perished in Haiti in the earthquake of 12 January 2010. Pic Macaya National Park The Pic Macaya National Park, on the southern peninsula, which is from Port-au- Prince and to the northwest of Les Cayes, has a designated area of that includes a ravine formation located between the mountain peaks of Pic Formon () and Pic Macaya (). The park receives an annual average rainfall of . The Rivere Ravine Sud rises from these mountains and flows through the park. Karst limestone formations and agricultural areas are also part of the park. There are two major types of vegetation in the park ‚Äì the wet forests on limestone formations (in an elevation range of 800-1200m), and the cloud forest combined with pine forest including endemic plant species. The largest broad leaf trees are of pine some of which are in height. Detailed floristic surveys have recorded 470 species of trachophytes, which include 367 species of anglosperms, 99 species of mosses, 63 species of liver worts. In addition, the vascular plant species reported are 136, of which 29% are endemic to Haiti. Orchids are also found in large numbers. Other wildlife consists of birds and amphibians which are mostly endemic. The most productive agricultural lands of the Plaine de cayes are within the park area. The park has many trekking paths including to the mountain trek to peak Pic Macaya (). Coral reefs Coral reefs in Haiti cover a stretch of of coast. While it is assessed that the coral reefs are over exploited for fishing, with elkhorn coral put on the US Endangered Species List, the reef structure is stated to be stable and the living coral are generally occupy 10% of reefs, and algae and sponge cover about 50%. The fish habitat hosts Caribbean fish species and invertebrate species with the reef structure providing the needed habitat. Use of fish trap, fishing net, spear or line fisherman with their paddle or sailboats are a common sight along the coral reefs. In order to bring the fish yield from the coral reefs to the level of 35 tons per km2 noted in other coral reef regions of the world, the MacArthur Foundation has initiated a project in Haiti to enhance fish production, from its present meager level, through a network of marine protected areas. The project also envisages inculcating knowledge to the Haitians on the economic potential and the need to also monitor the reefs. Some of the underwater species are 35 species of hard corals in the reefs, 55 species of sponges, 12 gorgonians. Flora The floral vegetation in the wildlife of Haiti consists of Hispaniolan moist forests (about only of undisturbed rainforest), Hispaniolan dry forests, Hispaniolan pine forests (in parts of the two national parks), Enriquillo wetlands (remnants of an old marine channel), and Greater Antilles mangroves which cover an area of only . Giant tree ferns, orchids, bayahondes (a variety of mesquite) on the hill slopes, cacti, acacias, and thorny woods on the dry plains, and mangrove forests on the coast line. Flora includes the Hispaniolan pine forests. The nation has 300 orchids and 600 fern species. Mahogany, rose wood and cedar are some of the trees that still exist at higher altitudes. Fauna Threatened species In the Massif de la Hotte alone there are 42 globally threatened mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians which need conservation efforts. The coastal zone ecosystem has been fairly well preserved and has coral reefs, mangrove forests and estuaries. Coral reefs are not part of the national parks. There are 38 species under the threatened and endangered list and some of them may have been extirpated too. Of these, nearly 50% are endemic and threatened with extinction and three are critically threatened. The critically endangered species are black-capped petrel, Ridgway's hawk (also endemic), stygian owl, and western chat-tanager and eastern chat-tanager, both endemic. Mammals The threatened Haitian solenodon is one of only two living species of Caribbean eulipotyphlans Endangered mammals in the country include the Haitian solenodon and the Hispaniolan hutia. A number of species of rodents formerly present have been driven to extinction, including montane hutia, Puerto Rican hutia, Samana hutia, twisted-toothed mouse, Lemke's hutia, Hispaniolan edible rat and imposter hutia. Marine mammal fauna reported are manatees, pygmy sperm whale, Fraser's dolphin, Atlantic spinner dolphin, Atlantic spotted dolphin, long- beaked dolphin, Pacific pilot whale and grey dolphin. There are a large number of species of bats and many are endemic to Haiti. Some of the identified bat species are: greater bulldog bat, sooty mustached bat, Waterhouse's leaf-nosed bat, Pallas's mastiff bat, Mexican funnel-eared bat, big free-tailed bat, Cuban flower bat, Cuban fig-eating bat, Parnell's mustached bat, Brazilian free-tailed bat, Jamaican fruit-eating bat and Cuban fruit-eating bat. A notable introduced mammal is the wild boar. Avifauna Hispaniolan trogon (Priotelus roseigaster), national bird of Haiti Golden-winged warbler (NT) Sketch of Hispaniolan parakeet (VU) Etang Saum√¢tre has over 100 waterfowl species as well as flamingo. There are over 200 species of avifauna, including the palmchat, La Selle thrush, introduced guineafowl, and grey-crowned tanager which is unique to Haiti. BirdLife International has identified 10 Important Bird Areas in Haiti, which cover about (1% of land area of Haiti). Of these, five are located in the four protected areas system while the other five are yet to be initiated. The prominent near threatened species is the grey-crowned palm-tanager (Phaenicophilus poliocephalus). As of 2013, the bird species identified are 266 of which globally threatened are 14, 2 are endemic. and nine introduced species. The species which are critically threatened, near threatened, endangered and vulnerable category are the following. Hispaniolan trogon (Priotelus roseigaster) is endemic, near threatened according to Red List IUCN and is the national bird of Haiti. ;Critically endangered * Ridgway's hawk (Buteo ridgwayi) ;Endangerered * Bay-breasted cuckoo (Coccyzus rufigularis) * La Selle thrush (Turdus swalesi) * Hispaniolan crossbill (Loxia megaplaga) ;Near-threatened * Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) * Reddish egret (Egretta rufescens) * Piping plover (Charadrius melodus) * Semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris alba) * Buff-breasted sandpiper (Tryngites subruficollis) * White-crowned pigeon (Patagioenas leucocephala) * Plain pigeon (Patagioenas inornata) * Least pauraque (Siphonorhis brewsteri) * Chimney swift (Chaetura pelagica) * Hispaniolan trogon (Priotelus roseigaster) * Palm crow (Corvus palmarum) * Golden-winged warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera) * Gray-crowned palm-tanager (Phaenicophilus poliocephalus) ;Vulnerable * West Indian whistling-duck (Dendrocygna arborea) * Hispaniolan parakeet (Aratinga chloroptera) * Hispaniolan parrot (Amazona ventralis) * White-necked crow (Corvus leucognaphalus) * Golden swallow (Tachycineta euchrysea) * Bicknell's thrush (Catharus bicknelli) * White-winged warbler (Xenoligea montana) Reptiles Rhinoceros iguana (Cyclura cornuta) on Limbe Island, northern Haiti The American crocodile is reported at Etang Saum√¢tre. Caimans are also reported in the rivers in the southern part of the peninsula. Snake charming is an active trade in Haiti, and wild snakes are often hunted in the country. Amphibians Six species of amphibians (frogs) have been reported. These are: Hispaniolan ventriloquial frog, Macaya breast-spot frog, La Hotte glanded frog, Macaya burrowing frog, Mozart's frog and Hispaniolan crowned frog. However, La Selle grass frog, the reportedly extinct species, has not been traced. The endemic frogs species are found in the remote southern mountains of Haiti and are considered \\"a ‚Äòbarometer species‚Äô for ecological health\\" of the island country.

Depending on the technique and equipment used, carwalking can lead to damage of private property. It often is a response to cars being parked illegally in areas exclusively allocated to pedestrians and a protest against the negative impacts of high motorization rates in urban areas. Reported cases Germany The most famous carwalker was Michael Hartmann:de:Carwalking who performed the act in Munich, Germany, in the 1980s. The peak of automobile friendly policies was around the seventies and the eighties in the western world, and such high number of motor vehicles in urban areas had as consequence a large number of cars illegally parked on side-walks and other pedestrian-reserved areas. Hartmann, in his book which describes his actions, states that once in 1988 he was walking with his girlfriend and due to many cars parked on the side-walk, they had to continuously zigzag between the cars so he decided to walk straightforward above the cars. United Kingdom An initiative in Kings Heath (Birmingham) distributes posters that warn drivers their cars will be \\"bonneted\\" if parked on pavement obstructing pedestrians. France Another reported case happened in Lyon, France, in 2011 when Peter Wagner, a German engineer, decided to walk on top of a car that was illegally parked on the side-walk in such a manner that he could not squeeze past. At that moment the owner of the car arrived and later sued him for property damage, demanding 800 Euros for repairs. The carwalker was condemned to pay 300 Euros, but later appealed. His appeal was denied. Mexico In Mexico City, a pedestrian activist called Peat√≥nito, a mix of the Spanish words for pedestrian (peat√≥n) and astonished (at√≥nito), is famous for walking over cars.

Plot Donald Duck parachutes into the jungle of a remote Pacific island to wipe out a Japanese airfield undetected.Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 166Akita, Kenney (2013), p. 53 He loses most of his equipment in the process of landing and is nearly eaten by a pair of crocodiles. He uses a rubber raft to travel down the river. He is located by Japanese snipers, including one disguised as a rock and one disguised as a slant-eyed and buck- toothed tree. He initially mistakes their bullets for mosquitoes and presses onwards. His raft is caught beneath a waterfall and starts inflating. He makes sure the raft hits nothing that would pop it. When he gets to the edge of a cliff, he sees the airfield. The raft has already exploded, causing water to flow. This large amount of water splashes onto the airfield, wiping the whole thing clean, but leaving disfigured airplanes. Upon seeing the ruins of the airfield, a proud Donald declares his mission accomplished (\\"Contacted enemy, washed out same\\"). Analysis The cartoon expresses blatant anti-Japanese sentiment. However, the focus is mostly on Donald and his efforts and less on the racial aspects of the enemy. This has allowed the short to be broadcast to modern audiences with most of the Japanese references removed. There are Japanese caricatures and depictions of the Imperial Japanese Army. There is also a reference to Hirohito. The Japanese soldiers speak in stereotypical dialect and advocate firing the first shot at a man's back. The gag with the enemy soldier disguised as a tree can be traced back to Shoulder Arms (1918). It was also used in A Lecture on Camouflage (1944).Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 193-194 It was later utilized by the Indians during their battle with the Lost Boys in the 1953 Disney animated feature Peter Pan as well. Though earlier war-era shorts (e.g. Donald Gets Drafted, The Vanishing Private, etc.) depict Donald's experiences and training as a regular U.S. Army draftee and infantry private, the commando mission and Pacific Theater of Operations setting in this short are seemingly 6th Ranger Battalion or Paramarine/Marine Raider- inspired.

This river flowing over rooted at the mouth of Pierre-Paul Lake, located in Rang Saint-Pierre, in the eastern part of the territory of Saint-Tite. Because sometimes mountainous terrain, the main course of the river described a big \\"Z\\" through a predominantly agricultural land (a forest in the early part of the course, due to the reforestation of former agricultural land in the area north of Pierre-Paul Lake). From its source, the river flows through the \\"road Pierre-Paul\\" and headed straight north across four lots in row St-Thomas (South) situated in the territory of Saint-Tite, then continuous in Sainte-Th√®cle, draining 10 lots in row St-Thomas (South), where it crosses the first time the road Charest.In the past, this road was known as a natural extension of the St-Thomas (South) road. This route allowed residents of rang St-Thomas and rang St-√âmile (North) to go faster to Saint- Tite via the \\"road of Pierre-Paul lake\\". The name \\"Charest road\\" was recognized in 1968, in reference to Mr. Florent Charest whose family lived in a house at the intersection of the Rompr√© road (road 352) and St-Thomas Road (South).

The river continues to flow on six lots in row St-Pierre, before making a small prank on three lots in the 4th row Northeast Rivi√®re des Envies (in Saint-Tite). With its tributaries streams, Pierre-Paul River receives the waters of 4th row Northeast Rivi√®re des Envies and a small area of northern territory of Saint S√©verin.

In the end of course, the river makes a few curves before throwing in the Batiscan River (on the southwest side), up to the village of Saint-Adelphe.Historical Research made by the historian Gaetan Veillette (Saint-Hubert) with reference to maps issued by the Department of Mapping Ministry of Energy and Resources In 1925, the municipality built a new covered bridge on Pierre-Paul River, almost at its mouth, that is the current road 352.  History  At the end of the 19th and early 20th Century, Pierre-Paul River was used especially in the spring (or during large floods) for timber transport by flotation this which involved activities loggers or \\"cageux\\". In spring 1872, Felix Lafontaine and his men (Edward Methot, Irvine Johnson, Alfred Buist, Pierre Bordeau (son of Michael), Pierre Lafontaine (son of Hilaire) and Georges Thiffeau (son of Hubert) were down logs in-beyond the causeway on the small river and owned by Price Brothers. On May 9, 1872, these men were arrested and accused of taking possession of the road May 9, 1872 the Constitutional.Le Constitutionnel (April 14th 1873): 2, col. 3-4. Posted on website: http://mauricie.cieq.ca/doc_topo_fiche_info.php?-action=browse&-recid=698 At the end of the 19th century, an ice road was laid from December to March on Pierre-Paul River to flow more easily to woodlots or to Saint-Tite before the land routes were fit for wheeled freight vehicles, especially to cross the streams. Close to its mouth, the bridge of the route 352 crosses Pierre-Paul river at the village (South West side of the Batiscan river).  Arm of Pierre-Paul River  The creek \\"Pich√©\\" drains much of the farmland in row St- Thomas of Sainte-Th√®cle cutting perpendicularly twenty lots on about (from North to South) up to Rompr√© road designated route 352 (linking Saint-Adelphe and Sainte-Th√®cle). The crossing of creek Pich√© and route 352 marks the boundary between the two municipalities. On its path in row St-Thomas, creek Pich√© has collected the waters of two small tributaries (one is creek Francoeur) that drain two areas of southeastern row Saint-Georges. After the foundation of Sainte-Th√®cle (in 1873), the settlers built a forestry road in this area in order to connect Sainte-Th√®cle to Batiscan river. This forestry road was necessary for logging industry, to more easily reach Saint-Stanislas and allow the priest of Sainte-Th√®cle to make the trip for serving families of the futur Saint-Adelphe parish. This road was hardly suitable in summer for wagon until the 19th Century. The overflow of the creek Pich√© blocked temporarily the road every spring, preventing them from circulating. From the Rompr√© road (road 352), this small stream is called \\"Arm of Pierre-Paul River\\" (bras de la rivi√®re Pierre-Paul). This river flows south crossing on (almost in a straight line) 11 farm lots in row St-√âmile in Saint-Adelphe up to the bridge of St-Emile road. From this bridge, this small river flows in a more sinuous path on by water (or in a straight line) in the Southwest Batiscan River row and empties into the Pierre-Paul River.Coordinates of the mouth of the \\"Arm of Pierre-Paul River\\": longitude: -72.44556, latitude: 46.73139.

Native Americans artifacts in row St-Thomas Long before the arrival of the first French-Canadian settlers, Native Americans were present in the Saint-Thomas row in Sainte-Th√®cle. In the 1970s, Emile Tessier, farmer, found some Native American artifacts on lots 351-107 and 351-108 of St-Thomas row, which he has owned from 1949 to 1981.Article \\"Exp√©dition arch√©ologique\\" (archaeological expeditions) by Ga√©tan Veillette, Journal Le Dynamique, July 10, 1974, p. 2 These artifacts dated from the \\"prehistoric archaic\\" period (BC) were mostly cut and polished stones, as instruments of hunting and working in Native American prehistory. These preserved artifacts are stored at the University of Quebec at Trois-Rivi√®res (UQTR). Many of them were exposed in June 1974 at the Morin room during celebrations of the centenary of Sainte- Th√®cle in collaboration with the archaeologist Ren√© Ribes.Ga√©tan Veillette, chronic \\"√âchos du Centenaire\\" (Echoes of the Centennial), Journal Le Dynamique, April 24th 1974, p. 10, stating that the Indian coins found in row St-Thomas, will be on display as part of centennial celebrations of Sainte- Th√®cle. These Native American artifacts have been found around the \\"creek Pich√©\\" and a tributary stream (coming from North), about in a straight line from the Batiscan River.Article: \\"Pendant deux jours - Une exp√©dition arch√©ologique √† Ste-Th√®cle\\" (During two days - An archaeological expedition), Journal L'Hebdo de Portneuf, October 28th 1974, p. 2, by journalist Ren√© Matton, including visiting the visit of the farm of Mr. Emile Tessier who discovered Native American artifacts and artifacts yards before the colonization of the St. Thomas ranked by plowing.  Toponymy  In the early 1870s, the place name \\"Pierre-Paul\\" meant an area of the mouth of the said river, on the right bank of the Batiscan River. This area was at the end of the 19th century the original core of the village of Saint-Adelphe (southwest bank of the Batiscan River). Thereafter the church of the village was built in front of the mouth, on the other side of the Batiscan River. The mouth of the Pierre-Paul river is located between that of the Rivi√®re des Envies (Saint- Stanislas) and Tawachiche River (Lac-aux-Sables) on the right bank of the Batiscan River. According to one theory, the origin of the name and the \\"Lake Pierre-Paul\\" and \\"Pierre-Paul River\\" would be linked to an Indian family, called Pierre-Paul, who lived near the Pierre-Paul lake.Source: Names and places of Quebec, the book Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec (Geographical Names Board of Qu√©bec) published in 1994 and 1996 as an illustrated dictionary printed, and in that of CD-ROM produced by Micro-Intel in 1997 from the dictionary. According to another theory, the place name \\"Pierre-Paul\\" is a popular adaptation, derivative of the apostles of early Christian names, like the names of rows detached from the former territory of Saint-Stanislas, including: row St-Pierre (in Saint-Tite where is the Pierre-Paul lake), row St-Paul (in Saint-S√©verin) and St-Thomas (in Sainte-Th√®cle). At the head of the river, Pierre-Paul lake is located in the row Saint-Pierre Saint-Tite.

History In Broken Hill‚Äôs early days the residents lived in dwellings that consisted mainly of tents or iron structure, and the small community was dealt many hardships over the including dust storms, severe heat, drought, dirty drinking water, unsanitary conditions, disease and mining accidents were commonplace. The major illnesses in the community were diphtheria, typhoid, lead poisoning, pneumonia, dysentery and enteritis and there was a high mortality rate for the young of Broken Hill. In 1886 there was no medical facility in the township of Broken Hill, in contrast Silverton, New South Wales had three medical practitioners, but after the BHP Company was approached by the Miners association it was agreed to provide a temporary hospital structure that could hold six beds, a morgue and two outhouses were also included, this first initial structure was a simple timber and iron dwelling. Though only the year after in 1887, Broken Hill‚Äôs first hospital was opened on 16 May by Wyman Brown, to replace the temporary structure, this new hospital was built on the site of Broken Hill‚Äôs present jail, at a cost of 260 pounds, over the next few years several additions were built onto the hospital. In September 1888 the contract for the erection of the new hospital was awarded to R.Honey at the cost of 3,566 pounds, to be built in Thomas Street the location of the site of the present hospital. The new hospital was officially opened on 26 June 1889 by Sir Henry Parkes, the hospital had received donations prior to the opening from the directors of the BHP Company (500 pounds), and George McCulloch (700 pounds). The surgical ward was named the \\"McCulloch Ward\\" to commemorate his generosity. In June 1939, the Governor-General of Australia, Lord Gowrie, laid a foundation stone for the new Hospital, and officially opened the Australian Aerial Medical Services wireless station at Round Hill. In September 1941, the Governor of New South Wales, Lord Wakehurst opened the new five-story air conditioned Hospital which had a capacity of 245 patients; his wife Lady Wakehurst opened the Hospital Kiosk. Over the years additions were made to the Hospital; In 1930 the Maternity wing was officially opened, and a new maternity wing rebuilt in 1954, enforcing visiting hours for the new mothers, it provides a \\"wide range of comforts for mother and baby and a waiting room for the anxious father,‚Äù the hospital was also a registered school for general and midwifery nursing, with a high standard of teaching.

It originally aired on CBS in the United States on November 16, 2010. The episode is the first of a two-part story arc and continues the long-term storyline within the series of the complex relationship between protagonist Ziva (Cote de Pablo) and her father, Mossad Director Eli David (Michael Nouri). During the first installment, the NCIS team is assigned to protect Eli when he arrives in Washington D.C. for an inter-agency conference and must deal with three Palestinian terrorists who are attempting to assassinate him. A number of recurring actors appeared in the episode to portray the Mossad officers, including TJ Ramini as Malachi Ben Gidon and Arnold Vosloo as Amit Hadar. Israeli actress Sarai Givaty was cast for a new role as Liat Tuvia, the officer who replaced Ziva on the Kidon unit. The episode is written by Jesse Stern and directed by Dennis Smith. It was watched live by 19.43 million viewers.  Background  NCIS follows a team of government agents who work for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. The main cast includes Mark Harmon as team leader Leroy Jethro Gibbs, Michael Weatherly as Senior Agent Anthony \\"Tony\\" DiNozzo, Cote de Pablo as Mossad Liaison Officer turned NCIS Agent Ziva David, Pauley Perrette as Forensic Specialist Abby Sciuto, Sean Murray as Special Agent Timothy McGee, David McCallum as Autopsy Technician Donald \\"Ducky\\" Mallard, Rocky Carroll as NCIS Director Leon Vance, and Brian Dietzen as Medical Assistant Jimmy Palmer.  Plot  In the opening scene, the team arrests a young woman on suspicion of espionage and terrorism. Shortly thereafter, they learn that she had only used an electronic device to steal credit card details from the actual terrorist. The investigation leads to Ziva's former team leader, Mossad Officers Malachi Ben Gidon (TJ Ramini), and replacement Liat Tuvia (Sarai Givaty). They inform her that her father, Director Eli David (Michael Nouri), is set to arrive in Washington D.C. to attend an NCIS conference. Ziva is at first incredulous, as Eli has not left Israeli soil in over a decade, but he appears the following day. On learning that three Palestinian terrorists are planning an attempt on Eli's life, the NCIS team is designated to protect him during his stay in the United States. The assignment is complicated by Ziva and Eli's estrangement, though she asserts that she can operate as normal, a claim that Gibbs backs. Liat still questions this, and Ziva agrees to a practice exercise to determine if she is fit to defend her father. Ziva later confronts Eli about his nonchalant attitude towards her ordeal in the desert and the prospect of his own death. He responds that the responsibility of his work renders him unable to allow his personal emotions to dictate his choices. He further reminds her that there had been a time when \\"things were different\\". The episode ends on a cliffhanger when, after an attack by the terrorists at the conference apparently fails, Vance and David go to a safe house. Gibbs cannot reach them on the radio and Officer Hadar is shown to be lying dead at the safe house.  Production   Writing  In August, executive producer Shane Brennan was asked if the show would delve more deeply into the storyline surrounding Ziva's captivity and torture in Somalia that took place in the previous season. He did not directly address this but divulged, \\"In November sweeps, we dip again into a story that perhaps everyone thought was played out. It involves Ziva.\\" A month later, Brennan stated that this would be brought about through the return of Ziva's father, Eli David, who had sent her on the suicide mission a year prior. Described as \\"an emotion-charged reunion\\", the two-part episode arc would reportedly \\"[reveal] much about the enigmatic Eli David, and one of the other team members\\". In an interview before the episode aired, Cote de Pablo (portraying Ziva), said, \\"It's a two-part episode where the whole Israeli team comes back from Israel, including Ziva's father. So obviously that's going to be a big thing for Ziva because she finally gets to confront her father for sending her away on, basically, what I would call a suicide mission. They get to see each other after all of that and there's conflict.\\" She added that the episode \\"affects [Ziva's] relationship with her father\\" and that \\"People will have to watch to see exactly how, but maybe there will be an unspoken forgiveness between father and daughter.\\"  Casting  Israeli actress Sarai Givaty was cast to depict Mossad Officer Liat Tuvia in Enemies Foreign and Enemies Domestic. Givaty's casting was reported in the Israeli news, and ADD agent Yaron Lichtenstein commented, \\"We are proud of Sarai for joining the agency's series of international success stories.\\" Brennan elaborated on the character's role in the story arc, saying that Liat's presence would leave Ziva feeling replaced \\"personally and professionally\\". Givaty commented, \\"There's a bit of tension there, and it gets to high levels. But there's a good ending!\\" Jesse Stern remarked on the recurring appearance of Mossad agents within the series: Michael Nouri returned to portray Ziva's father, Eli. Arnold Vosloo and TJ Ramini also appeared again to depict Mossad Officers Amit Hadar and Malachi Ben Gidon respectively.  Filming  Cote de Pablo divulged, \\"Stuff is going to be blowing up, and not only that, but it was a crazy episode to shoot because there were sooo many stunts for me. And so that was a little hard. I had a big fight sequence, I had to shoot a lot‚Äîthere was a lot of gunfire‚Äîand there was one huge explosion in which a whole kitchen blows up and I'm in the middle of it! Needless to say it was fun, but incredibly challenging.\\"  Reception  Mandi Bierly from Entertainment Weekly wrote, \\"For viewers, however, those scenes of the joint NCIS-Mossad protection detail running through an ambush scenario in the hotel parking garage, Ziva confronting her father about why he wasn't begging her forgiveness for leaving her for dead in the desert, and the actual ambush itself, were the highlight of the episode.\\" BuddyTV contributor Jacky Jackman enjoyed the Liat and Ziva's interactions and wrote, \\"The dynamics between the two women is interesting. Ziva extols her achievements with Mossad, but Liat has chops of her own.\\"  References  Category:2010 American television episodes Category:NCIS (season 8) episodes ","title":"Enemies Foreign"},{"id":"39423129","text":"Salah Hasarma (, ) is a retired Arab-Israeli footballer who works now as a manager.Barak Bakhar sacked from Ironi Kiryat Shmona, Salah Hasarma will replace him in the next season Shlomo Weiss, Walla, 14.5.2015 Honours League *Israeli Premier League (1): **2011‚Äì12 *Israeli Second Division (3): **1995-96, 2006-07, 2009-10 Cup *Toto Cup (2): **2010‚Äì11, 2011‚Äì12 *Toto Cup (Leumit) (2): **2006‚Äì07, 2009‚Äì10 References Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Arab citizens of Israel Category:Israeli footballers Category:Hapoel Tayibe F.C. players Category:Bnei Sakhnin F.C. players Category:Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv F.C. players Category:Hapoel Haifa F.C. players Category:Hapoel Ironi Kiryat Shmona F.C. players Category:Hapoel Ironi Kiryat Shmona F.C. managers Category:Liga Leumit players Category:Israeli Premier League players Category:People from Bi'ina Category:Football players from Bi'ina Category:Association football defenders Category:Israeli football managers ","title":"Salah Hasarma"},{"id":"39423133","text":"So-Bahli-Alhi Glacier is in Snoqualmie National Forest in the U.S. state of Washington, on the north slopes of Whitehorse Mountain.

Gameplay The player character is an \\"Indian brave\\" stereotype who wears a tanned vest and trousers, and a headband with a feather. The player ascends a magical tree by hopping from branch to branch and climbing vines and ladders‚Äîwhile also dodging larvae, owls, and lightning bolts. The player can jump and dangle from branches. He earns points by gathering apples, arrows, daggers, and coronets. The tree is 2004 meters tall. A gauge tracks the player's altitude, and at the conclusion of each level the game informs the player how much further to climb to reach the goal: A castle on the treetop. The ascent is divided into nine game levels; the player character dances at the conclusion of each level. When the player clears the ninth level, a curtain opens to reveal the castle at the top of the tree. Smiling from the crenels of the castle's parapet are a young woman in a purple frock, and a man wearing a war bonnet. After the end sequence, the game then continues at the base of the tree.

Its similarity with a spinnaker is that it is not attached to a stay along its luff, and typically has a slightly larger curvature than a genoa. Luff shape and tension is maintained by the halyard and a bolt rope which is woven into the sail itself, and it is this stiff tensioned rope which allows the sail to be furled on itself. In addition, many screechers are gybed by allowing the sail to fly free and pass in front of the bolt rope and invert, much in the same way that an asymmetrical spinnaker is gybed. Tacking with a screecher may require furling and re-setting. The similarity with a genoa is that it is typically a white sail, and the clews always overlap the mast.

She was the chief hair stylist for Columbia Pictures. Hunt fell into her career by accident. She was working as a stenographer for a costume company in Omaha, Nebraska. She began washing and arranging the company's wigs on her own time because they were being neglected. When she went into a shop to look over a display of wigs, she was offered a job by the owner, George Westmore of Hollywood. This eventually led to a position with Columbia Pictures. According to IMDb, the first film with which she was involved (uncredited) was the 1935 Party Wire, starring Jean Arthur. She worked with Rita Hayworth before the latter became a star. According to some sources, it was Hunt who came up with the idea to dye Hayworth's black hair auburn. She also arranged for the painful, lengthy electrolysis that raised Hayworth's hairline. For the 1946 film noir Gilda, Hunt stated, \\"I got fan mail - and hate mail - about Rita's hair! Some clergymen declared that I would go to hell for contributing to evil because of Rita's hair in Gilda!\\" When Orson Welles insisted on shortening the actress's long hair (and dyeing it blonde) for The Lady from Shanghai (1947), Hunt was flown in from New York, where she was on her honeymoon, to do the cutting. During the course of her career, she also styled such stars as Irene Dunne, Rosalind Russell, Loretta Young and Evelyn Keyes. Cult movie actress Pamela Duncan credited Hunt with bringing her to the attention of the casting department of Columbia.

Construction and commissioning Walker was ordered on 9 December 1916; she was laid down by William Denny and Brothers at Dumbarton, Scotland, on 26 March 1917. She was launched on 29 November, completed on 12 February 1918 - fitted to lay mines and commissioned on the same day. She was assigned the pennant number G22 in January 1918; it was changed to G09 in April 1918, and to D27 during the interwar period. Service history World War I All of the V- and W-class destroyers, Walker among them, were assigned to the Grand Fleet or Harwich Force for the rest of World War I, which ended with the armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918. Interwar Walker took part in the British campaign against Bolshevik forces in the Baltic Sea during 1919, seeing action against Russian warships; from May 1919 she participated in a blockade of Bolshevik warships in Kronstadt and suffered two hits from the Bolshevik battleship during an attempted breakout by the Bolshevik fleet. She was part of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Atlantic Fleet from 1921 to 1930, and visited Helsinki in Finland, from 15 to 22 June 1926 when the flotilla made a cruise in the Baltic. She was decommissioned in 1932, transferred to the Reserve Fleet, and placed in reserve at Rosyth, Scotland. In August 1939, Walker was recommissioned with a reserve crew to participate in the Royal Review of the Reserve Fleet by King George VI. She remained in commission after the review as the fleet mobilised in the face of rising tensions between the United Kingdom and Nazi Germany; proceeding to Plymouth to prepare for wartime service. World War II =1939= When the United Kingdom entered World War II in early September 1939, Walker was assigned to the 11th Destroyer Flotilla at Plymouth for convoy defence and patrol duties in the Southwestern Approaches. On 9 September she and the destroyers and escorted Convoy OB 2. While returning to Plymouth after detaching from the convoy, Walker and Vanquisher collided, killing 14 menThe Battle of the Atlantic by Andrew Williams BBC Worldwide 2002, p.46, about 200 nautical miles (370 km) southwest of Cape Clear Island, Ireland, on 10 or 11HMS VANQUISHER (D 54) - V & W-class Destroyer September 1939 (sources differ) with both ships suffering serious damage. Walkers First Lieutenant was compelled to shoot some of the injured who were trapped in the wreckage.Williams p. 46 She was able to proceed under her own power, but Vanquisher required a tow, so Walker embarked injured personnel from Vanquisher, proceeded to Plymouth and entered Devonport Dockyard for repairs on 14 September 1939. Her repairs were not complete until mid-November, when she rejoined her flotilla, while Vanquisher was not fully repaired until early January 1940. =1940= On 11 January 1940, Walker rescued 32 survivors of the British merchant tanker El Oro, which had sunk west-northwest of Liverpools Bar Lightship at on 6 January 1940 after striking a mine laid by the German submarine . From 13 to 19 January 1940, Walker joined the destroyer leaders and and the sloop in escorting Convoy HG 15F during the final leg of its voyage from Gibraltar to Liverpool; Broke detached on 15 January and the destroyer joined the escort to relieve Keppel on 17 January. From 25 to 26 March, Walker, the destroyer leader , and the destroyers and escorted convoy Convoy OG 23 in the Southwestern Approaches during the first part of her voyage from the United Kingdom to Gibraltar until relieved by two French Navy warships. After detaching from OG 23, she, Campbell and Volunteer joined the sloops and as the escort for Convoy HG 23 on the final leg of her voyage from Gibraltar to Liverpool, where she arrived on 30 March 1940. Norway On 8 April 1940, Walker was transferred to the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands to support operations during the Norwegian Campaign, escorting British military convoys carrying troops and equipment to the Nordic country. She suffered slight damage during a German air attack on a convoy on 9 April 1940. She came under sustained German air attack on 30 April while evacuating Allied troops from Andalsnes and Molde, where she ferried troops from shore to the light cruiser and destroyer for passage to the United Kingdom. On 1 May 1940, she covered the final evacuation from Andalsnes, also under heavy German air attack. During May 1940, Walkers pennant number was changed to I27. On 28 May, she and the destroyers , , and deployed in Norways Rombaksfjord to provide gunfire support during an Allied ground operation to capture Narvik. As the Norwegian Campaign ended in an Allied failure to halt the German conquest of that country, Walker became the last Allied ship to leave the Narvik area as she escorted the final Allied evacuation convoy from Norway, departing Harstad on 8 June 1940. Walker made an unsuccessful counterattack against the German submarine on 2 July 1940 after the U-boat torpedoed and sank the passenger ship while Andora Star was carrying German and Italian prisoners of war to Canada with 1,676 people on board. The destroyer then returned to the United Kingdom and underwent repairs that lasted until September 1940. In October, she passed her post-repair acceptance trials and returned to convoy escort duties in the Western Approaches. =1941= On 5 February 1941, Walker became part of the 5th Escort Group as the flagship of its senior officer, Donald Macintyre, and continued with escort duties in the Western Approaches. In mid-March, she took part in the highly successful defence of Convoy HX 112. As part of the escort on 16 March, she rescued 38 survivors of the Canadian merchant ship J. B. White, which the German submarine had torpedoed and sunk at while attacking the convoy. On 17 March, she and the destroyer counterattacked the German submarine - commanded by one of the Kriegsmarines top submarine commanders, Kapit√§nleutnant Joachim Schepke - with depth charges while defending the convoy, forcing U-100 to the surface; Vanoc then rammed and sank U-100 at 03:18 hours at the approximate position , crushing Schepke to death with her bows while he stood on the submarines bridge. Thirty-seven other members of U-100s crew also died in the sinking; Walker took aboard her six survivors. While rescuing them, Walker detected U-99 - commanded by another top German submarine officer, Korvettenkapit√§n Otto Kretschmer - attempting another attack on HX 112, and used depth charges to force her to the surface, after which her crew abandoned ship and scuttled her with the loss of three men dead,uboat.net U-99 at 03:43 or 03:48 hours (sources differ), at the approximate position . Walker rescued U-99s 40 survivors, among them Kretschmer, who spent the rest of the war as a prisoner-of-war. The loss of these two officers, as well as of another highly successful submarine commander, Korvettenkapit√§n G√ºnther Prien, killed 10 days earlier in the loss of U-47 while attacking Convoy OB 293, was a major early blow to the German submarine force. Walker remained on convoy escort duty in the Western Approaches for the remainder of 1941 and into 1942. =1942= From 12 to 15 January 1942, Walker joined Vanoc, Volunteer, and the destroyer as the local escort of Convoy WS 15, consisting of 22 troopships bound - from the River Clyde in Scotland - for Suez, Egypt; Bombay, India and Singapore; during the first leg of her voyage in the Northwestern Approaches. On 17 February 1942, she joined Convoy WS 16 - 21 troopships headed for Suez and Bombay - in the Clyde to serve along with Witherington, the destroyer , and a large Home Fleet force consisting of the battleship , the aircraft carriers and , the light cruiser , and the destroyers , , , , , , , and , as escort. On 21 February, the Home Fleet force detached to proceed independently to Gibraltar, but Walker, Verity and Witherington remained with WS 16 until 22 February, when the light cruiser and destroyer relieved them as escort and they detached. Walker remained on convoy duty in the Western Approaches for the rest of 1942. Near the end of the year, the Royal Navy selected her for conversion into a Long-Range Escort. =1943= Walker was taken into dockyard hands on the River Thames in January 1943 for her conversion. Upon completion, she underwent post-conversion acceptance trials in May and having passed them, spent June in work-ups in preparation for her return to combat service. In July 1943, she was assigned to the 4th Escort Group for convoy defence duties in the Northwestern Approaches and North Atlantic, which she continued until the end of the year. =1944= In January 1944, Walker was transferred to the Home Fleet to escort Arctic convoys to and from the Soviet Union. In February 1944, she was part of the close escort group for Convoy JW 57 during its voyage from the United Kingdom to the Soviet Union along with Keppel, the destroyers and , and four s; although the convoy endured German air and submarine attacks during its passage, it suffered no losses among its convoyed ships and arrived at the Kola Inlet on 28 February 1944. On 2 March, the ship joined the same vessels as close escort for the returning Convoy RA 57, which came under attack by German submarines on 4 March and arrived at Loch Ewe, Scotland, on 10 March 1944. On 29 March 1944, Walker joined Beagle, Boadicea, Keppel, and the sloops of the 2nd Escort Group - , , , , and , - as close escort for Convoy JW 58 during its voyage to the Soviet Union; it came under German air and submarine attack, but arrived at the Kola Inlet on 4 April. From 7 to 12 April, Walker, Beagle, Boadicea, Keppel and the destroyers , , , , and escorted Convoy RA 58 during its voyage from the Kola Inlet to Loch Ewe, which the Germans did not detect. On 20 April, Walker joined 15 other Home Fleet destroyers, the escort aircraft carriers and , the light cruiser , and three Royal Canadian Navy frigates in escorting the merchant ship Nea Hellas on a voyage to collect ships and personnel from various Soviet Arctic ports, culminating in an arrival at the Kola Inlet. Nea Hellas had to return to the United Kingdom with mechanical problems, but the other ships pushed on, arriving at the Kola Inlet on 23 April 1944. On 13 May, Walker embarked 13 United States Navy enlisted men for transportation to the United Kingdom and departed the Kola Inlet as part of the escort for Convoy RA 59 on its voyage to the United Kingdom. After experiencing very bad weather and two days of German submarine attacks, she detached from RA 59 on 3 May 1944. Selected for participation in Operation Neptune, the assault phase of the Allied invasion of Normandy which was scheduled for early June 1944, Walker upon her arrival in the United Kingdom, was assigned to Escort Group 137 along with the corvette and the trawlers and . The escort group spent the rest of May preparing for Neptune, then proceeded in early June to Milford Haven in Wales, where it joined Convoy E2B2Z - 32 troop transports carrying United States Army troops and equipment to reinforce the beachhead - on 4 June 1944. The convoy arrived at the invasion beaches on 8 June, two days after the initial assault. On 10 June, Walker began escorting convoys to the beachhead during the initial build-up period in Normandy. Released from supporting the beachhead later in June, Walker returned to escort work in the North Atlantic. She continued this until October, when she was reassigned to the 8th Escort Group for another tour of duty escorting Arctic convoys. On 20 October, she joined the sloops and and three Flower-class corvettes as the close escort for Convoy JW 61, which arrived at the Kola Inlet on 28 October without suffering any losses during its passage from the United Kingdom. From 2 to 9 November she joined the same ships in providing the close escort for Convoy RA 61 during its trip from the Kola Inlet to Loch Ewe. The ship then resumed convoy escort work in the Northwestern Approaches, but in December 1944 returned to the Arctic run, joining Keppel, Westcott, and the sloops of the 8th Escort Group on 30 December 1944 as the close escort of Convoy JW 63 during its voyage to the Soviet Union. =1945= Convoy JW 63 arrived at the Kola Inlet on 8 January 1945 after an uneventful passage from the United Kingdom. From 11 to 23 January, Walker, Keppel, and Westcott provided the close escort for Convoy RA 63 during its voyage from the Kola Inlet to the Clyde, a passage made in very bad weather that allowed only slow progress. Walker returned to Atlantic convoy duty in February 1945. In March, she was assigned to antisubmarine warfare operations and convoy defence in the waters around the British Isles, continuing in this role until the German surrender in early May. Decommissioning and disposal Walker did not deploy operationally after Germanys capitulation; the Royal Navy soon decommissioned her and placed her in reserve. She was sold on 15 March 1946 for scrap and was disposed of at Troon in Scotland.

This established a need for increased human resources to help execute the program. In 2005, the Institute of Medicine released its influential report, Healer‚Äôs Abroad: Americans Responding to the Human Resource Crisis in HIV/AIDS, which detailed a Global Health Service Corps that would send full-time, paid professionals abroad not only to address in-country health care needs, but also to offer clinical, technical, and managerial guidance to foreign health care workers.National Research Council.

S. 850, 109th Cong., 1st Sess. ¬ß 274 (2005). Between 2005 and 2010, many of the original authors and champions of Healers Abroad continued their campaign. Notably, Fitzhugh Mullan, Chair of the Healers Abroad Committee, wrote an opinion-editorial for the Journal of the American Medical Association in which he described other nations creating GHSP-like programs and proposed a model that blended the strengths of the Peace Corps and the National Health Service Corps. Another bill was drafted in the United States Senate in 2008 and in 2010, a bill was being scripted in the House. Between 2009 and 2010, the Institute of Medicine released two reports, of which one focused on the importance of health to international development and diplomacy, and the other on the critical need for health-based human resources to strengthen the HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria efforts. Furthermore, in September 2010, physicians Paul Farmer, Sara Auld, and Vanessa Kerry‚Äôs Perspectives piece in the New England Journal of Medicine reinvigorated the argument for a program comparable to GHSP. It noted the importance of health to development and of the possibility of sending U.S. doctors, nurses, and other health professionals abroad in a partnership program to provide education, investment in capacity of local health professionals, and support for health system strengthening. It outlined a vision of loan repayment to ensure that financial obligations were not a barrier to service. The piece gained attention and GHSP planning efforts resumed. Vanessa Kerry and Sara Auld started a grassroots campaign online, created a petition, and began to connect to many of its original champions. Among them were Fitzhugh Mullan, Michele Barry, Senior Associate Dean for Global Health and Director of Global Health Programs in Medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine, and Ed O'Neil Jr., founder and president of OmniMed, and to those already engaged in similar work such as Baylor College of Medicine and its Pediatric AIDS Corps.

Vanessa Kerry and Sara Auld attended the event and asked the directors: \\"What did the Peace Corp directors think about sending doctors, nurses, and other health professionals abroad as Peace Corps Volunteer medical educators to invest in human resources for health?\\" All four directors responded favorably.  Volunteer deployments  GHSP was officially announced in March 2012. Applications for Global Health Service Partnership Peace Corps Volunteers (GHSP PCVs) opened in July 2012 and closed on December 1, 2012. In July 2013, the first nursing and physician volunteers were deployed.

PureVolume was created by Unborn Media, Inc; Mitchell Pavao; Brett Woitunski; and Nate Hudson, all from the University of Massachusetts. PureVolume is a website for the discovery and promotion of new music and emerging artists. The mission was to give artists a new promotion tool. Each artist has a profile that typically contains basic info, updates, photos, shows and music for streaming. Artists have the option of making each of their songs available for free download. Listeners and fans are also able to create profiles to interact with artists and each other, as well as track and share music they like. PureVolume went through several layout changes and a change from orange to blue, but the layout from the homepage to the artist profiles has remained essentially the same since 2003. The focus is on promoting \\"indie\\" music groups and artists, but some of them have become popular. It was acquired by pop culture media conglomerate SpinMedia in 2010. History The idea to create PureVolume was that of officer/creator Woitunski after gaining advance knowledge that CNET planned to take mp3.com offline upon acquisition, slated for late 2003. PureVolume.com launched in beta on Thanksgiving Eve of 2003, with 'The Suicide Pact' as the main featured band. Prior to the launch of PureVolume, Unborn Media had designed local business websites in Amherst, Massachusetts. It was thought of as a 'magazine' with sound. The homepage would have both split of editorial and paid placement, with the content rotating within each spot except the \\"PurePicks\\" section, a weekly recommendation of eight new artists for users to enjoy. For all of 2003 and 2004 and the first four months of 2006, that was Welch's task. It was taken over by both Brett and Mike, and the distinct musical taste gave the homepage a new feel and began a new chapter for the brand. More predominantly in the site's early years, indie labels looked to the site for new artists, the \\"PurePicks\\" were put out each week. After two weeks in the section, Gym Class Heroes were in a meeting with Fueled by Ramen Records, the first band to be 'discovered' on PureVolume, which opened a new chapter in the world of music. Effective June 30th, 2018, PureVolume will shut down indefinitely. Influence Record labels use PureVolume to promote their artists and even look for new ones to sign. The first artists to link a record deal directly to their PureVolume page were the Gym Class Heroes. The fame of groups such as Paramore, Boys Like Girls, Fall Out Boy, All Time Low, He Is We, My American Heart, Daphne Loves Derby, Taking Back Sunday, My Chemical Romance, Forever The Sickest Kids, Panic! at the Disco, Twenty One Pilots, Brand New, The Scene Aesthetic and The Spin Room have been credited to exposure on PureVolume.

During the American Civil War, he designed the torpedo boat CSS David that was used to attack the Union ironclad USS New Ironsides. Following the war, he helped pioneer the use of fertilizers in agriculture and led the growth of phosphate fertilizer manufacturing in Charleston, South Carolina. Early career and family Born in Charleston, South Carolina, St. Julien was the oldest child of merchant and ship owner John Ravenel and his wife Anna Eliza Ford. After attending grammar schools in Charleston, he left for Morristown, New Jersey to continue his education. In 1840 he graduated from the Medical College in Charleston after studying medicine under J. E. Holbrook, then continued his studies for a summer in Philadelphia and a year at Paris, France. Returning to Charleston, he began to practice medicine and was named Demonstrator of Anatomy at the Medical College. Finding the medical work distasteful and disliking the drudgery of being a doctor, he began an association with Professor Louis Agassiz, studying microscopy, natural history, and physiology. When the American Association for the Advancement of Science met in Charleston during 1850, Dr. Ravenel was the treasurer. On March 20, 1851, he married writer and historian Harriott Horry Rutledge (1832‚Äì1912), the sole child of Edward Cotesworth Rutledge and Rebecca Motte Lowndes. Between 1852 and 1872, St. Julien and Harriott would have nine children. Their son Francis '(Frank') Gualdo Ravenel married the poet Beatrice Witte. St. Julien undertook the study of chemistry beginning in 1852. However, he did not completely forsake his previous work. When an outbreak of Yellow Fever struck Norfolk, Virginia in 1855, he was one of the first on the scene and worked throughout the epidemic to aid the patients. At his Stony Landing Plantation along the Cooper River, he experimented with the production of lime from marl deposits located along the river banks. After cement was discovered under the limestone layers, in 1856 he partnered with Clement H. Stevens to establish the Colleton Lime Works at his plantation which sold lime for 0.90c per barrel. This company would provide most of the lime used by the southern states during the American Civil War. Civil War St. Julien Ravenel inherited the house at 5 East Battery in Charleston from his parents and lived there with his family until his death.With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Dr. Ravenel volunteered with the Phoenix rifles and served as a private during the siege of Fort Sumter. Thereafter he was commissioned as a surgeon with the 24th South Carolina infantry, under the command of Colonel Clement H. Stevens. The following year, he was placed in charge of the Confederate Hospital in Columbia, South Carolina where Confederate soldiers from Virginia and elsewhere were being treated. With the Northern fleet blockading the South's ports, the torpedo boat was devised as a counterblockade weapon. In 1863, the first purpose-built torpedo boat was conceived and built near Charleston, South Carolina using private funding. Using an earlier concept of Ross Winans, Dr. Ravenel provided the initial design for the vessel and the construction was completed with the aid of David C. Ebaugh. Named the David, this cigar-shaped, semi-submersible vessel was fitted with a torpedo at the end of 14-foot iron spar mounted at the bow. The idea was to drive the steam- powered boat at an enemy ship and detonate the torpedo along the hull. On October 5, 1863, the CSS David was used to attack the USS New Ironsides near Charleston Harbor, causing damage but failing to breach the hull. Ravenel's knowledge of chemistry was put to use when he was placed in charge of a laboratory in Columbia, South Carolina that was used to manufacture nearly all of the South's medical supplies, including drugs and medicines. As General Sherman's army approached, the laboratory was ordered to entrain for a location in North Carolina. His wife Harriott stayed behind with their provisions and thus was witness to the arrival of the Union army and the burning of the city. Post-war period Prior to the war, Dr. Ravenel had begun experimenting with chemistry for improvement of agricultural conditions. He resumed his investigations in 1866, where he discovered the benefit of using phosphate of lime in agriculture. He was able to increase the cotton yield in one section of his plantation from 100‚Äì150 pounds per acre up to 300‚Äì400 pounds. In August, 1867, Ravenal and N. A. Pratt discovered a rich concentration of this mineral at Lambs, South Carolina. As a result, he helped to found the fertilizer manufacturer Wando Phosphate Company. Over time, this led to a burgeoning fertilizer industry that helped the commercial recovery of South Carolina. For the remainder of his career, he served as chemist to the larger phosphate companies. Among his accomplishments were the development of simpler fertilizer manufacturing techniques, a method of growing abundant short grain and hay on the sandy South Carolina coast, and the boring of artesian wells of moderate depth in the Charleston area to supply water to local manufacturing industries. For the last, he is now known as the \\"father of Charleston's artesian well system\\". St. Julien Ravenel died of cirrhosis of the liver, March 15, 1882, and was survived by his wife, four sons, and five daughters. Writing under the pseudonym of H. Hilton Broom, his wife Harriott won a Charleston newspaper prize for her 1879 novel Ashurst. She later published Eliza Pinckney (1896), The Life and Times of William Lowndes of South Carolina (1901), and Charleston, the Place and the People (1906).

On Kangaroo Island near modern-day American River, South Australia, Pendleton commissioned the construction of the schooner Independence, the first ship built in South Australian waters. Pendelton was killed by natives on Tongatapu on 1 October 1804.

The Carson Valley Improvement Club used the building to host both community social events and town meetings. The building has served as the informal seat of government in Minden since its construction; after the Carson Valley Improvement Club moved out in 1920, the Minden Commercial Club and later the Minden Town Board continued to hold government meetings at the building. Though Minden is unincorporated, the groups meeting in this building have acted as local liaisons to Douglas County's government and have helped manage local government services. In addition, the building has continued to house a variety of social events, including concerts, movies, religious services, and basketball games. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 4, 1983.

This church is stone, covered with white plaster, and it was built around the year 1200. The church was built on the island of Ve√∏ya due to the importance of the great Romsdalsfjorden during the Viking Age. The church was designated as the main church for the parish of Ve√∏y starting in 1480. In 1589, the parish had annex churches located in Bols√∏y, R√∏dven, Kleive, Vestnes, Tresfjord, Vistdal, and Eresfjord. The church was used for centuries until 1901 when a royal decree was handed down to discontinue its active use. The church continued to be used until 1907 when the new Ve√∏y Church was built on the mainland. The new church was located there so that residents of the parish could more easily reach the church. The old church is now preserved as a historic site and it is no longer regularly used. The church is now jointly owned by the parish, the municipality, and the Romsdal Museum.

In 2011 Mallah travelled to Syria to film the Syrian Civil War, declaring himself in support of the Free Syrian Army. In 2015 he was controversially allowed to ask a question on the ABC program Q&A;, leading then Prime Minister of Australia Tony Abbott to question \\"Which side is the ABC on\\"? First Australian charged under its anti-terrorism act In 2003, when he was nineteen, Mallah was the first to be arrested under then-recently enacted amendments to Australia's federal Criminal Code Act which introduced specific offences for terrorism-related acts. Mallah spent two years in Goulburn Correctional Centre subject to solitary confinement and a 22-hour lockdown while he awaited trial. The circumstances of the case were that after being refused a passport, Mallah appealed through a lawyer to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Both Mallah and his lawyer were barred from viewing the evidence supporting the passport refusal, which was upheld. Mallah then purchased a rifle and ammunition, prepared his will and made a video to be played after he died. Mallah bragged about this and his claims were eventually brought up on the Alan Jones radio program. The Australian newspaper then paid him $500 for an interview. The Counter Terrorist Command, also aware of the threats, sent an undercover officer posing as a freelance journalist to do another interview. This undercover officer offered Mallah $5,000 if he would hold everyone hostage at ASIO headquarters and give the \\"journalist\\" the scoop. Entrapment of a suspect in Australia is legal if the police obtain a \\"controlled operations authority certificate.\\" However, the police did not get a certificate so the entrapment was illegal. At his trial Justice James Wood allowed the entrapment into evidence. Wood criticized the media for accepting claims as credible and giving them undue prominence in newspapers. At his trial, the jury found Mallah not guilty of 2 counts of \\"committing an act in preparation for or in the planning of a terrorist act, contrary to s.101.6(1)\\". Justice Wood stated that \\"the prisoner was an idiosyncratic, and embittered young man, who was to all intents something of a loner, without significant prospects of advancing himself. While I accept that the Prisoner enjoyed posing as a potential martyr, and may from time to time, in his own imagination, have contemplated creating a siege and taking the lives of others, I am satisfied that in his more rational moments he lacked any genuine intention of doing so.\\" Mallah was also charged with \\"making a threat to cause serious harm to a third party: (s.147.2)\\", referring to the verbal threats made to the undercover officer. He was sentenced to two and a half years jail. In September 2005, his jail term was extended by 6 weeks for assaulting a prison officer. Dismissal from ANZ Stadium In 2011 Mallah was employed by ANZ Stadium until he was fired for broadcasting a video of non- public areas of the Stadium on YouTube. The videos included a shot of a private dining room, for VIPs, and a shot of the kitchen, where he worked. ANZ Stadium officials stated that the broadcast breached his employment conditions. Mallah asserted that his firing was triggered by his employers learning that he had once been charged under the anti-terrorism act.  Observing the Syrian civil war In 2011, following uprisings that were part of the Arab Spring, Mallah travelled to Syria during the Syrian civil war. Mallah has asserted that he and all the other Australians he met in Syria were filling non-combat roles, which would not violate Australian law. While in Syria Mallah uploaded videos he made to Facebook, some of which were republished by mainstream Australian news sources. The Australian published a profile of Mallah, where he described himself as engaging in a \\"Jihad of Peace\\". They quoted Mallah describing how seeing his guide shot by a sniper filled him with a new appreciation for the freedoms found in Australian society. Mallah says he does not support ISIS, that he \\"hates ISIS\\" and supported the Free Syrian Army. Return to Australia In December 2012, after returning from Syria, The Australian reported Mallah claimed he had received death threats from individuals who doubted his truthfulness, and suspected he was a covert employee of Australian security agencies. In January 2013, Mallah was a member of a panel interviewed by ABC journalist Stephanie Smail. According to Smail, Mallah started the Free Syria Army Australia group. In May 2013 Mallah published a guideline for other Australians considering volunteering to help Muslims in war zones on how they could do so, without violating provisions in the anti-terrorism act that barred Australians from fighting in foreign wars. According to the News.com.au, Mallah's analysis was that various kinds of non-violent assistance in war zones would not violate Australian law. Mallah asserted treating wounded fighters would not violate Australian law; neither would preparing or serving rations, or carrying flags. Mallah claimed that individuals killed while aiding fighters would be martyrs entitled to the same after-life benefits an actual fighter is promised. His guideline also included advice for volunteers who wanted to avoid risking their own lives. Zee News reported on 18 May 2013 that Mallah had been charged under the anti-terrorism act a second time for broadcasting the video.  Appearance on ABC Q&A;  Mallah appeared on Q&A; on 22 June 2015, putting a pre-approved question to LNP member Steven Ciobo. Prime Minister Tony Abbott strongly criticised the ABC for \\"giving Mallah a platform\\" saying that \\"heads should roll\\". He asked \\"Which side is the ABC on?\\" and said that the ABC \\"betrayed\\" Australia. Mallah went on to debate Waleed Aly on The Project and published an opinion piece in The Guardian's Comment is free. Mallah argued that young Muslims in Australia feel vilified by a government \\"looking for votes\\" and that the citizenship proposal is a \\"very dangerous step\\" that moves Australia towards \\"an authoritarian system.\\" Mallah argued that \\"ASIO and counter-terrorism police\\" benefit from community relations, and that the government should listen to people like him because he had \\"been to Syria\\" and understands the world view of young people considering leaving.  Flag design  Mallah designed a new flag for Australia in 2015 which he named AusRoo. Denied entry to Singapore On 7 June 2018, Mallah was denied entry to Singapore. Officials detained him, at the airport. Mallah was able to contact an Australian reporter before Singapore officials took away his phone, prior to questioning him. He later reported they questioned him for five hours, before sending him back to Australia.

Castilleja kerryana (Orobanchaceae): A new species from the Rocky Mountains of northern Montana. Phytoneuron 2013-21 1-14. The first collection of this plant was tentatively identified as a specimen of Castilleja crista-galli, and it is also similar to C. fraterna and C. pulchella. It differs from the latter two in its color and in the shape of its stem and flower corolla. Distribution This plant is known only from the Scapegoat Wilderness, in the Flathead Range of the Rocky Mountains in northern Montana. It has been found only in Cambrian limestone substrates. It grows in thin, rocky soils in krummholz and fellfield habitat. It occurs at 8,000 to 9,000 feet elevation. Description Castilleja kerryana is a perennial herb growing from a woody caudex and yellowish root system. It may have several flowering stems as well as several shorter vegetative stems. They may be decumbent at the bases and grow upright toward the tips. They are greenish, reddish, or purplish, hairy in texture, and up to 18 centimeters long. The leaves are linear to lance-shaped, often cleft into lobes, green or purple- tinged in color, and up to 7 centimeters long. The inflorescence is a dense spike up to 7 centimeters long and spreading up to 8 wide. The calyx and bracts of the flowers are colored \\"red, scarlet, crimson, red-orange, coral, salmon, salmon-pink, red-magenta, and violet-magenta, to very occasionally yellowish.\\" The lobed, pointed bracts are up to 3 centimeters long, and the flowers may extend past them. The sepals are brightly pigmented. The flower corolla is up to 5 centimeters long, tubular, beaked, and pouched. The stigma protrudes. The fruit is a capsule nearly a centimeter long. Ecology Castilleja kerryana often grows alongside Dryas octopetala, and it is suspected that it is hemiparasitic on it, as many Castilleja tap the roots of various other species. Other plants occurring in the habitat include Carex rupestris, Carex scirpoidea, Kobresia myosuroides, Abies lasiocarpa, Salix vestita, Arenaria rossii, Silene acaulis, Aquilegia jonesii, Caltha leptosepala, Cardamine rupicola, Draba lonchocarpa, Physaria didymocarpa, Smelowskia calycina, Saxifraga oppositifolia, Polygonum viviparum, Potentilla glaucophylla, Hedysarum sulphurescens, Oxytropis sericea, Androsace lehmaniana, Phlox pulvinata, Eritrichium nanum, Besseya wyomingensis, Pedicularis bracteosa, Pedicularis contorta, Pedicularis groenlandica, Antennaria alpina, Antennaria aromatica, Oreostemma alpigenum, Erigeron lackschewitzii, and Senecio canus.

In the next match, in Round 11 against the Gold Coast Titans, with scores at 24-all, Peachey went from hero to zero after he dropped a pass from Peter Wallace and didn‚Äôt dive on the ball. Titans halfback Ashley Taylor picked up the ball and raced downfield before Anthony Don acrobatically dived over in the corner one play later to seal a bizarre 28-24 win at Penrith Stadium. In July 2016, Peachey was axed from the Panthers squad for their Round 18 clash with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks after he returned training late after a night out in Cronulla. Peachey had planned to head back to Penrith in the morning but slept in and attempted to make it to training on time by catching a taxi with the trip costing him $250 and arriving in the clothes he was wearing the night before with no training gear. He eventually played in the Panthers NSW Cup team for the week. Peachey returned in the next match, playing at centre and scoring a try in the 22-18 win. After Peta Hiku and Dean Whare suffered season ending knee injuries at the start of the season, Peachey was shifted from being a bench utility to centre. Peachey finished the 2016 NRL season with him playing in 24 matches and scoring 13 tries for the Panthers. 2017 On 10 February 2017, Peachey played for the Indigenous All Stars against the World All Stars in the 2017 All Stars match, playing off the interchange bench in the 34-8 win at Hunter Stadium. On 7 May 2017, Peachey again played for City Origin in the last ever City vs Country Origin fixture, playing at centre in the 20-10 win in Mudgee.http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/city-down-country-2010-in- final-version-of-annual-rugby-league-fixture/news- story/e4979a3c283f8adb56a1c3c78f84d2c1 In the Panthers Week 1 Elimination Final match against the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles at Sydney Football Stadium, Peachey scored a controversial try when the scores where locked at 10-10 all in the 73rd minute. The ball appeared to bounce off Peachey‚Äôs arm into his hand from a rebound off a grubber kick from team mate Bryce Cartwright, dived over the try line which was given the green light by the video referee bunker and the Panthers would be 22-10 winners and advance into Week 2 of the finals series.http://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/tryone-peacheys-controversial-try- helps-panthers-beat-sea-eagles-2210-in-nrl-finals-clash/news- story/1201b808870f7195fc894c4002417360https://www.nrl.com/news/2017/09/09/panthers- eliminate-sea-eagles-in-finals-week-one-upset/ Peachey finished the 2017 NRL season with him playing in 25 matches and scoring 8 tries for the Panthers. 2018 On 2 March 2018, Peachey announced that he signed a 3-year deal with the Gold Coast Titans worth $1.5 million, starting from 2019.http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/teams/roosters/tyrone-peacheys- move-to-gold-coast-to-penrith-on-threeyear-deal-from-2019-confirmed/news- story/660b1b1a68fccc3c102266d9adcc5e56https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl- premiership/gold-coast-secure-tyrone-peachey-penrith-move- from-2019-season/news-story/df0d70a0d028b1852de5e444a2f4b080 In round 8 of the 2018 NRL season against the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, Peachey played his 100th NRL game in Penrith's 22-14 win at Penrith Stadium. 2019 Peachey made a total of 21 appearances for the Gold Coast in the 2019 NRL season as the club endured a horror year on and off the field. During the halfway mark of the season, head coach Garth Brennan was sacked by the club after a string of poor results. The Gold Coast managed to win only 4 games for the entire season and finished last claiming the Wooden Spoon.

The piece had previously shown in a number of international art venues, including New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and London's Barbican. Description Rain Room allows visitors to the installation to walk through a downpour without getting wet. Motion sensors detect visitors' movements as they navigate through the darkened space, becoming \\"performers in this intersection of art, technology and nature\\". This site-specific sound and light installation uses 2,500 litres of self-cleaning recycled water, controlled through a system of 3D tracking cameras placed around the ceiling. The cameras detect a visitor's movement and signal groups of the water nozzles in the ceiling, stopping the flow of water in a roughly six-foot radius around the person. Founded in 2005, Random International is a London-based collaborative studio for experimental and digital practice within contemporary art. Their work, which includes sculpture, performance and large- scale architectural installations, reflects the relationship between man and machine and centres on audience interaction. Sharjah‚Äôs Rain Room is the work's Middle Eastern debut and the first installation of the project in a purpose- built, permanent structure. The work was previously shown at the Barbican, London (2012); MoMA, New York (2013); Yuz Museum, Shanghai (2015); LACMA, Los Angeles (2015‚Äì2017) and MoCA Busanhttp://www.busan.go.kr/moca_en/exhibition/1392239, Busan (2019). Sharjah Sharjah Art Foundation constructed a purpose-built visitor centre located in the city's residential area of Al Majarrah to house the permanent installation of Rain Room, with up to six visitors at a time taking fifteen minutes to explore the experience. Tickets are sold online for scheduled visits and cost Dhs25 for adults. Opened in May 2018 by Ruler of Sharjah Dr Sheikh Sultan Bin Mohammad Al Qasimi together with Shaikha Hoor Bint Sultan Al Qasimi, president of Sharjah Art Foundation, Rain Room is part of the Sharjah Art Foundation Collection and the first of a series of artist-designed permanent spaces planned for Sharjah. At the Sharjah inauguration, Koch and Ortkrass commented, \\"That Rain Room has found a permanent home at Sharjah Art Foundation is a humbling thought. The organisation [Sharjah Art Foundation] is unparalleled in its approach to art, exhibition-making and relationships with a wider public audience.\\" Previous installations Kate Bush (curator), Head of Art Galleries, Barbican Centre, said: \\"The Curve has previously played host to guitar-playing finches, a World War II bunker and a digital bowling alley. Random International have created a new work every bit as audacious and compelling ‚Äì Rain Room surpasses all our expectations.\\" \\"At the cutting edge of digital technology, Rain Room is a carefully choreographed downpour ‚Äì a monumental installation that encourages people to become performers on an unexpected stage, whilst creating an intimate atmosphere of contemplation. The work also invites us to explore what role science, technology and human ingenuity might play in stabilising our environment by rehearsing the possibilities of human adaptation.\\" Timeout described Rain Room at the Barbican as \\"one of the most popular art installations of the past few years. It was incredible, featuring endlessly dripping water that magically avoided you as you walked through it.\\" Despite being dubbed \\"Wildly successful\\" at the Barbican, Business Insider reviewed the Rain Room at MoMA as \\"Not worth the wait\\", their reviewer having spent over three hours queuing for a ten minute 'experience'. However, Gizmodo called it a \\"blockbuster\\" and \\"the kind of installation that museums dream of\\".

Club career Born in M√©rida, Extremadura, Lolo began his career with Real Valladolid's youth sides, and made his senior debuts in 2010‚Äì11 for the B-team in the Tercera Divisi√≥n. On 20 August 2012 he appeared in his first official game with the main squad, playing the last four minutes in a 1‚Äì0 La Liga away win against Real Zaragoza, the first matchday of the season.Newboys Valladolid stun Zaragoza ; ESPN FC, 20 August 2012 Lolo signed for S.L. Benfica in Portugal on 2 August 2013 in spite of being threatened by his former club, which later led to compensation as his link was not severed by mutual consent. He was assigned to the reserves and played his first match for them on the 26th, coming from the bench in the 81st minute of the Segunda Liga home fixture against Portimonense S.C. and scoring the final goal in a 3‚Äì0 win. On 30 August 2014, Lolo was loaned to Segunda Divisi√≥n's CD Lugo on a season-long deal. The following summer, he joined Segunda Divisi√≥n B side C√°diz CF also on loan. In the 2016 off-season, Lolo was acquired by Mexican club Club Necaxa, but was immediately loaned back to CD Toledo of the Spanish third level. He helped them finish second in their group, and then signed for fellow third- tier team Elche CF in July 2017. Lolo contributed two goals in Elche's promotion campaign (five across all competitions), but spent the following season on loan at Recreativo de Huelva and Valencia CF Mestalla. On 14 July 2019, he signed a two-year contract with Gimn√†stic de Tarragona, but was unregistered from the main squad the following transfer window due to poor performances, and terminated his contract in March 2020.

The album was released on 3 June 2013 on the 4AD record label. It was recorded in Portland, Oregon with producer Tucker Martine, and features guest vocals from Neko Case and My Morning Jacket's Jim James. It is the last album recorded with keyboardist Carey Lander, who was diagnosed with osteosarcoma during the early stages of the album's creation in 2011. Though lead singer Tracyanne Campbell found it difficult to write songs during Lander's illness, the latter insisted that the album be finished. After completing the album and touring with the band in support of it, Lander died on 11 October 2015. Music and lyrics In terms of musicality, Allmusic's Fred Thomas told that the release is \\"another installment of brilliant pop\\". At American Songwriter, Hal Horowitz touched on how \\"these songs soar, glide and seem effortless in their innocent simplicity.\\" Consequence of Sound's Bryant Kitching felt that \\"they‚Äôve honed their brutally honest and quirky take on heartbreak into something they can now wield with delightful precision.\\" Andy Gill of The Independent alluded to how \\"songwriter Tracyanne Campbell couches harsh, sometimes brutal sentiments in soothing musical surroundings.\\" At The Skinny, Chris Buckle highlighted that the release \\"conveys a warm familiarity\\" that will be repaid with \\"many revisits\\" to listen to the album. Kevin Liedel of Slant Magazine evoked that \\"Desire Lines sees Camera Obscura straining harder for complexity; they maintain their famous sweetness while dialing back on some of the stronger melodies\\", but this leads to \\"their most balanced and monotonous effort to date, with such little distinction between its dozen sleep tracks that it makes ideal background music\\", which he called \\"sugary but tasteless syrup.\\" Drowned in Sound's Jon Clark felt the album was consistent, which he told that \\"Desire Lines bears witness to a band that sound at ease with themselves\\", and this was accomplished in \\"layered with interest, the instruments subtly interweaving with one another to create music that is somehow both complex and simplistic.\\" In addition, Clark called this \\"polished, luxurious pop\\", which contains \\"Campbell‚Äôs excellent vocal, [and this] makes for a consistently concise, effective and moving record.\\" At Paste, Evan Rytlewski noted that \\"the result is the purest late-night album that Camera Obscura has recorded yet\\". This Is Fake DIY's Gareth Ware found this to be \\"literate, swooning pop music in the shape of new long-player 'Desire Lines'.\\" At The A.V. Club, Annie Zaleski noted that the album \\"unlike previous Camera Obscura efforts, its songs aren‚Äôt as immediate or arresting\\" because it \\"has a few sleepy spots\\" that \\"causes it to drag on occasion.\\" In the realm of lyrics, Thomas said it has the \\"now trademark mixture of heartbreaking and sharply astute lyrical turns guiding the songs through either romantic longing, dour tragedy, or touches of the band's more and more familiar dry sense of humor.\\" Horowitz noted that \\"her slightly retro, girl group pop features often edgy lyrics that belie the music‚Äôs droolingly pretty, perky and persistent melodies.\\" The Guardian's Maddy Costa told that \\"it's love that's the culprit: love that makes people approaching middle-age gauche as teenagers; love that wraps up heartbreak in happiness ‚Äì a contradiction Campbell has long embodied, singing acidic lyrics in a sugary voice golden with optimism.\\" Susannah Young of Under the Radar evoked that \\"typically, Tracyanne Campbell writes Camera Obscura's lyrics from an omniscient narrator's perspective, but even when she gets more personal, there's still a bit of a guarded tone at play.\\" Clark felt that the lyrics are \\"thoughtful and sardonic\\", which were done with \\"a certain tastefulness to this record that is achieved by its potent, thoughtful lyrics that never seem stale or badly written.\\" Ware felt that the \\"record oozes an elegant stream of sophistication and songwriting\\". On the subject of production, Thomas called it \\"somewhat more clear than previous efforts, relying less on reverb and stuffing the frequency ranges with even more string sections, odd percussion, and pop accents than before.\\" Horowitz called the production \\"bigger,\\" and \\"the recording a touch more sophisticated but by and large, it‚Äôs all about auteur/lead singer Tracyanne Campbell‚Äôs sweet, innocent, succulent vocals.\\" Gill told that the album was \\"produced in [an] understated manner by Tucker Martine\\". Ware called it \\"a rich, clearly well-thought out and measured Tucker Martine production.\\" Critical reception Desire Lines has received generally positive reception from music critics. At Metacritic, they assign a \\"weighted average\\" score to ratings and reviews from selected mainstream critics, and the album has a Metascore of 78, which is based on 17 reviews and ratings. At AnyDecentMusic?, they assign a \\"weighted average\\", and based on 18 ratings and reviews taken, the album has a rating of 7.3-out-of-ten. Fred Thomas of Allmusic told that the release contains a \\"similar feel of a band bounding out of the gates with a renewed creative energy\\" that he called \\"some of their best and most confident work to date.\\" At American Songwriter, Hal Horowitz noted that \\"there aren‚Äôt many groups whose fifth album is as riveting as their first, but there also aren‚Äôt many groups with a vision as clear, focused and defined as that of Camera Obscura.\\" Consequence of Sound's Bryant Kitching called the effort \\"breathtaking as its inviting.\\" Maddy Costa of The Guardian claimed that \\"what feels different this time is the elegance and assurance of the music\\". At Q, they told that \\"when slipping downtempo into ballads, Camera Obscura are in a league of their own\\". Chris Buckle of The Skinny called the album \\"no shortcut or re-tread; rather, it‚Äôs the sound of a band following their hearts, comfortable and confident in their own skin.\\" At Under the Radar, Susannah Young proclaimed that \\"Desire Lines also sounds richer than any of Camera Obscura's previous albums.\\" Drowned in Sound's Jon Clark rated the album a nine-out-of-ten, and told that \\"this is pop music with a real soul to it, and Camera Obscura have bared it magnificently\\", which he vowed \\"this record is another perfect gem in their catalogue.\\" At Paste, Evan Rytlewski rated the album an 8.3-out-of-ten, and called the release \\"another superbly crafted album, well worth the wait\\", and noted how \\"Campbell may someday conquer her self doubts, but until then, her restlessness is paying dividends.\\" Melody Lau of Exclaim! rated the album eight-out-of-ten, and wrote that \\"Desire Lines refurbishes '50s pop, turning it into modern classics filled with unabashedly lovely melodies, just the way Camera Obscura want it, and just what we've come to expect, and love, about them.\\" At This Is Fake DIY, Gareth Ware rated the album an 8-out-of-ten, and told that the release is \\"honed and constantly improved, yet retains an aura of warm contentment throughout.\\" Furthermore, Ware wrote that they presented \\"it as a triumph against adversity may be simplistic and exaggerative, but what is certain is that in the record [...] assured, confident and cohesive as it is [...] Camera Obscura have come up trumps.\\" The A.V. Club's Annie Zaleski graded the album a B-, and affirmed that \\"Desire Lines is the rare record that sounds comfortable and familiar, but yet isn‚Äôt derivative.\\" At Uncut, they rated the album an eight-out-of-ten, and wrote that the \\"fifth album clothes Campbell's vignettes of thwarted romance in increasingly sophisticated arrangements.\\" However, Andy Gill of The Independent felt that \\"the songs' clean pop lines are revealed with the minimum of decorative detail,\\" that is done \\"most successfully\\". David Welsh of musicOMH cautioned that \\"this is at once an enjoyable effort and an opportunity missed.\\" Slant Magazine's Kevin Liedel told that \\"by no means their best effort,\\" but that \\"Desire Lines is nevertheless a pleasurable listen.\\" Track listing References Category:2013 albums Category:Camera Obscura (band) albums Category:4AD albums ","title":"Desire Lines"},{"id":"39423871","text":"The Turtle-Flambeau Flowage is a 12,942 acre lake, located in Iron County, Wisconsin.

The Turtle-Flambeau Scenic Waters Area offers 60 remote campsites accessible by water only. These sites are available year-round on a first-come, first-served basis. There is no camping fee, but camping on the flowage is restricted to designated sites. Historically, many lakeside resorts have existed in the vicinity of the flowage. However, today much of the shoreline remains sparsely developed.  Management  Some lake management activities are undertaken by the Turtle-Flambeau Flowage & Trude Lake Property Owners Association, Inc.

It was Crabbe's first feature film in six years. Plot Wyoming, 1879: Chad Santee, a former Cavalry sergeant, is a passenger on a stagecoach bound for Cheyenne, along with saloon singer Rose Fargo and a gambler known as Blackjack Silk. Chad is on his way to see brother Jubal's ranch for the first time. What he doesn't know is that Jubal is among masked outlaws who rob the coach. Chad intends to defend himself, but Blackjack, fearing a gunfight, knocks him cold. Rose takes umbrage, telling the gang about money Blackjack's hiding in his boot. Chad awakens to find Blackjack slapping the woman, so he flattens the gambler with a punch. A posse forms, led by Yellowstone Kelly, who used to be Chad's army commander. Yellowstone would like Chad to join him in Jackson Hole in the fur-trading business. Chad first hopes to capture the outlaws and retrieve a keepsake brooch of Rose's. Chad meets an Indian maiden named Meeteetse and treats her kindly, not knowing she's in league with the outlaws. She takes a liking to him. Chad discovers that Jubal's ranch is actually a hideout, with Shawnee Jack the gang's leader. He notices that Meeteetse has the stolen brooch and realizes Jubal is an outlaw. Shawnee now wants Chad dead for knowing too much. Chad promises not to betray his brother and Jubal vouches for Chad's honesty. The brooch is returned to Rose, but since Chad had possession of it, the law concludes that he must have been among those who stole it. Chad is placed under arrest. After finding out Chad loves Rose and has invited her to go to Jackson Hole with him, Meeteetse makes a deal with the sheriff. She will return the stolen loot if Chad is set free and Rose sent to jail. Blackjack plans to ambush Chad and is stabbed to death by Meeteetse. After a gunfight, the law realizes who the real robbers are and Chad is allowed to leave. He rides off with Rose to a new life in Jackson Hole, beginning a new trade and a family. Jubal accepts an invitation to join them. Shawnee Jack bides his time, then rides to Jackson Hole to kill Chad. He is distracted long enough by Jubal to permit Chad and Rose to remain unharmed. Jubal dies saving them, so in his honor, they name their baby girl Jubalee.

It was established on 3 August 2012 and commenced making investment commitments from 1 July 2013. In December 2018, an independent statutory review of the CEFC Act found that the CEFC had facilitated the flows of finance into the clean energy sector, with CEFC's investments successfully enabling projects that would not have otherwise proceeded, attracting substantial private co-investment to projects. The statutory reviewhttps://www.cefc.com.au/media/402001/cefc-statutory-review- deloitte-october-2018.pdf was conducted by Deloitte and tabled in Parliament on 14 December 2018. The CEFC submission to the Statutory Review of the Corporation is also publicly available.https://www.cefc.com.au/media/files/cefc-welcomes-publication-of- the-independent-statutory-review-of-its-operations/ On 5 August 2013 the federal Coalition Opposition led by Tony Abbott wrote to the CEFC asking it to stop making new loans and to cease assessing new projects. After the 2013 federal election, on 5 December 2013, then CEFC Chair Jillian Broadbent said on ABC Radio National that the government should \\"break an election promise\\" and keep the CEFC in operation, citing a 7% profit. Coalition Senator Arthur Sinodinos said that if it's making a profit, it should survive without the government and essentially confirmed the government would shut the corporation down. Legislation to abolish the CEFC and transfer the CEFC's existing assets and liabilities to the Commonwealth was put before Parliament but blocked by non-government senators in the Senate. In July 2015, Abbott announced he would ban the CEFC from investing in wind power and rooftop solar. On 13 July 2015, the CEFC said it was taking advice in relation to the draft Mandate. In December 2015, Fairfax media reported that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull had lifted the ban on CEFC investment in wind power, in his first major break from the former regime's environmental policy. The Guardian reported on 24 December 2015 that the CEFC had been directed to focus on innovative and emerging technologies, reversing a mandate by the former prime minister Tony Abbott that would have specifically blocked funding for windfarms and small-scale solar projects.The Guardian, 24 December 2015: New clean energy investment mandate a shift from policy proposed by Abbott Mr Ian Learmonth was appointed CEO in March 2017 https://www.cefc.com.au/media/files/cefc-board-appoints- ian-learmonth-as-new-chief-executive-officer-replacing-oliver-yates.aspx In August 2017 Mr Steven Skala AO was appointed CEO Chair. https://www.cefc.com.au/media/296276/minister-cormann-minister-frydenberg- media-release-cefc-appointments.pdf Mr Skala described the CEFC's performance in its first six years reflected its ability to independently implement Australian Government directions, supported by its pillars of good governance, responsible client selection and considered risk management.

He was the first Chief Justice of Hong Kong taking office in 1844. Early life Hulme was born in 1805 in Fenton, Staffordshire, England. He was the son of a \\"highly respectable solicitor.\\"London & China Telegraph, 18 March 1861, p16 He was called to the Bar of the Middle Temple in 1829. He served his pupillage with the noted barrister and author Joseph Chitty. He was a co-author with Chitty of A Practical Treatise on Bills of Exchange and A Collection of Statutes of Practical Utility. He also married Chitty's daughter, Eliza Legal appointment Hong Kong was ceded to the United Kingdom under the Treaty of Nanking signed in 1842. A military government was first formed. In 1844, civilian government was put in place headed by Governor John Francis Davis. Hulme was appointed the first Chief Justice of Hong Kong. The Colonial Office had great difficulty in finding a judge willing to go to the newly established colony. Hulme was offered the very high salary of ¬£3,000 per annum to go to Hong Kong. In return he agreed to give up his right to a pension. He arrived in Hong Kong Kong on 7 May 1844 on board the H.M.S. Spitfire together with Davis and other officials. He was also appointed as a member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council. The Supreme Court was formally opened on 1 October 1844 with Hulme on the bench. As Chief Justice, Hulme fearlessly protected the independence of the judiciary. He had a number of run-ins with Governor Davis that culminated in charges being brought against him of drunkenness. The charge against him read that he had been \\"in a state of intoxication as to attract public attention when attending a public entertainment given by Rear Admiral Thomas Cockrane on November 22, 1845\\". He was brought before the Executive Council of Hong Kong in 1847 who found him guilty and suspended him from his position. On 30 December 1847, Hulme returned to England during his suspension. The Colonial Secretary refused to uphold the verdict and Hulme soon returned to Hong Kong. In November 1846, in the case of Compton, Hulme refused to uphold a verdict of guilty against Mr Compton for instigating a riot in Canton handed down by the British consular court in Canton. Mr Compton, an English merchant, was fined HK$200 for causing a riot by kicking over a Chinese stall and beating its owner with his stick, and appealed to the Supreme Court of Hong Kong. Hulme was highly critical of the way in which the case was handled. Sir John Davis, the Governor of Hong Kong wrote to Lord Palmerston, the Prime Minister, stating: \\"Some fresh ordinance will inevitably be required to prevent such mischievous interference in international cases.\\"Keeton, The Development of Extraterritoriality in China, pp. 220‚Äì223 and 230. In February 1857, Hulme presided at the trial of ten Chinese men who had been charged in connection to a mass poisoning of Europeans in Hong Kong known as the Esing Bakery incident. The Attorney General, Thomas Chisholm Anstey, argued that the principal suspect, Cheong Ah-lum, should be hanged regardless of his innocence because it was \\"better to hang the wrong man than confess that British sagacity and activity have failed to discover the real criminals\\". Hulme replied that \\"hanging the wrong man will not further the ends of justice\\", and later accepted the jury's acquittal of Cheong. Hulme became very unwell to the end of his term of office and often would only commence court sitting at noon or 1pm. He was put under pressure to retire, but insisted that he be given a pension. He left Hong Kong on leave in early 1859 and in England was offered a handsome pension of ¬£1,500 per annum which he accepted. Death Hulme died soon after his retirement, on 1 March 1861 in Brighton, England.

It was produced by Robert E. Kent, directed by Edward L. Cahn and written by Samuel Newman.  Plot  Dr. Karol Noymann (Carradine), an atomic scientist, is killed in a laboratory explosion. His colleague, Dr. Adam Penner (Tonge), is disturbed by the accident and resigns his position and calls for changes. At Dr. Noymann's funeral, an invisible alien takes over Noymann's dead body. The alien, in Noymann's body, visits Dr. Penner and tells him the Earth must surrender or an alien force will invade and take over the Earth by inhabiting the dead and causing chaos. The alien demonstrates to Penner that they are able to make things invisible. Penner tells his daughter Phyllis (Byron) and Dr. John Lamont (Robert Hutton) about the experience and asks Dr. Lamont to relay the message to the government in Washington, D.C.. The government ignores the warning and Dr. Penner is labeled a crank by the media. Dr. Penner takes his daughter and Dr. Lamont to Dr. Noymann's grave, where they are visited by an invisible alien. Later, at the site of a plane crash, another alien takes over the body of a dead pilot (Don Kennedy), goes to a hockey game, chokes the announcer, and issues an ultimatum for the Earth to surrender. Another alien takes over a dead body from a car crash and issues the same ultimatum at a different sporting event. The media announce the threat and the governments of the world decide to resist the invasion. Aliens take over more dead bodies and blow up dams, cause fires and destroy buildings. Maj. Bruce Jay (Agar) arrives to take Dr. Penner, Phyllis and Dr. Lamont to a secret bunker. On the way, they are confronted by a scared farmer (Hal Torey) who tries to take their vehicle. Maj. Jay kills the farmer and they proceed to the bunker while an alien takes over the dead farmer's body. At the bunker, they are contacted by the government and tasked with stopping the alien invasion. They determine that the aliens are radioactive, and decide to capture an alien to conduct tests on. They attempt to spray an alien with acrylic to seal it in plastic, but this fails. They then fill a hole with the acrylic liquid and lure an alien into it. Once captured, the alien is taken to the bunker. Back at the bunker, they confine the alien in a pressure chamber and break the acrylic using high pressure to set it free. They try several experiments, but nothing affects the alien. Frustrated and hopeless, Dr. Lamont wants to surrender, but Maj. Jay does not. The two men fight and inadvertently damage some electronic equipment, setting off a loud alarm. They notice that the alien reacts violently to the noise. They make a sound gun and test it on the alien, causing it to become visible and killing it in the process. They try to inform the government, but their radio broadcast is jammed by the aliens, who are apparently nearby. Using a radio direction finder they follow the jamming signal to the alien ship, killing several aliens along the way. Maj. Jay walks through the woods to get to the ship and is confronted by several aliens. He kills them with the sound gun but is shot in the process. Despite being wounded, he finds the alien ship and shoots it with the sound gun, causing the ship to explode. With the jamming signal silenced, Dr. Penner is then able to contact the government and tell them how to stop the aliens while Phyllis tends to Maj. Jay's wound. Later, at the United Nations, Dr. Penner, Dr. Lamont, Phyllis Penner and Maj. Jay receive thanks for saving the world from the alien invasion.  Cast  * John Agar as Maj. Bruce Jay * Jean Byron as Phyllis Penner * Philip Tonge as Dr. Adam Penner * Robert Hutton as Dr. John Lamont * John Carradine as Dr. Karol Noymann * Hal Torey as The Farmer * Paul Langton as Lt. Gen. Stone * Eden Hartford as WAAF Secretary * Don Kennedy as Pilot * Chuck Niles as Hockey Game Announcer  Production  Production of Invisible Invaders began in December 1958. The film was made as part of a package deal with The Four Skulls of Jonathan Drake. It was the fourth science fiction film made by Premium Pictures. The shooting schedule and budget are not known. Byron said in an interview that the \\"picture was filmed rather quickly. I remember the director moving from one set-up to the next very rapidly\\". Film critic Bill Warren called it a \\"cheap little picture\\", noting that it \\"couldn't possibly have had a shooting schedule longer than two weeks (probably one)\\" and that the movie gives \\"every evidence of having been made in great haste\\". Costs were held down, in part, by re-use of special effects artist Paul Blaisdell's monster costume from 1958's It! The Terror from Beyond Space (also directed by Cahn) during a sequence in which one of the invaders is encased in plastic so it can be seen. According to author Randy Palmer, \\"To help camouflage the costume, optical effects were added to lighten the image and give it a distinct blur, so that it's very difficult to tell that the invader's true form matches that of (Blaisdell's) Martian Lizard Man\\". However, as Warren pointed out, by 1959 \\"no one cared about SF movies made on this budget level. They were just a product to get on the screen as soon as possible\\". Warren also commented on the film's extensive use of stock footage. \\"A great flurry of stock shots\\" were used \\"as the invaders smash things all over the world - fires, quakes, buildings collapsing, dams bursting\\". This is \\"dispiriting,\\" but \\"the very cheap and shoddy effects match the overall tone\\" of the movie. The stock footage includes the fatal car wreck scene from 1958's Thunder Road. Footage shot for the film itself was also repeated, with scenes re-used of the invisible alien making parallel grooves in the dirt as it shuffles toward Dr. Noymann's grave and then pushes aside some bushes.  Release  Invisible Invaders was released to US theaters on May 15, 1959. It was copyrighted on 8 May that year, a week before the film opened. Outside the US, it opened in Finland on August 12, 1960 and in Sweden on September 22, 1960. It was also exhibited in theaters in Brazil, Chile, Spain and the Soviet Union. In the UK, it received an \\"A\\" certificate from the British Board of Film Censors on June 15, 1959, which allowed it to be shown to \\"children accompanied by anyone over 16\\". To drum up domestic interest in the film, Variety said in its \\"Exploitips\\" listing that \\"the attention-getting title is the chief selling point - a ballyhoo man dressed in a rented space suit ... will get notice from neighborhood youngsters\\". Whether this was actually done, or if it convinced children to attend the movie, is unknown. In a review of the Blu-ray release of Invisible Invaders, Christopher P. Jacobs noted that in an audio commentary, noted sci-fi author Dr. Robert J. Kiss \\"gives some interesting data on the film's 1959 release and exhibition history, noting how it was almost always shown as the second of a double feature, quickly shifting from one-week runs to bookings of only a couple of days\\". However, the movie wasn't always the second feature. According to a contemporary advertisement for the New Plaza Theater in Odessa, Texas, Invisible Invaders was the third movie on a triple feature, with Plan 9 from Outer Space as the first movie and The Snorkel as the second, showing on September 27 and 28, 1959, just four months after Invisible Invaders was released.  Reception  The movie had only a short run but became a minor cult film on television.Joe Dante on The Invisible Invaders at Trailers from Hell accessed 2 June 2013 Jacobs says it had \\"unprecedented success in 1962 prime-time TV showings, after low ratings as a late night movie\\". For example, Invisible Invaders was shown on Chicago's WFLD in 1971 as part of its well-known \\"Science Fiction Theater\\" program. TCM ran the film as part of a monster movie marathon on New Year's Day 2007.  Critical response  Film critic Emanuel Levy rated the film 3 out of 5 stars. Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, academic Peter Dendle said, \\"Though clearly a product of its own time and a low budget, Invisible Invaders is engaging and fast-paced, riddled with genuinely inspired twists alongside breathtaking implausibilities\\".  Home media  Invisible Invaders was first released to the home video market on VHS videotape in 1996 by MGM/UA Home Video. The film was released on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment in 2003, packaged with Journey to the Seventh Planet as part of their Midnite Movies series. The Blu-ray edition, released in July 2016 by Kino Lorber, featured a full-length audio commentary by film historians Tom Weaver and Dr. Robert J. Kiss.  Soundtrack  Paul Dunlap composed the music for Invisible Invaders. Dunlap would later use much of the same music in three other science fiction movies: The Angry Red Planet later in 1959, The Three Stooges in Orbit in 1962, and Destination Inner Space in 1966.

Not only does Furman ease the institution's usual strict discipline, he changes it from an all-boy detention facility to co-ed. Juvenile delinquent Eddie Bassett observes with interest as new female inmates like Kitty and Babe arrive along with adult supervisors Grace Hartwell and Bess Monahan, who will look after the girls. As soon as the bashful Kitty expresses an interest in Eddie, the extroverted Babe causes trouble for her, causing Kitty to be injured in a fight and later attacked by another boy. Furman is also physically assaulted by Eddie. Various misdeeds lead to the governor's firing Furman and restoring Walton and the previous routine of discipline. Eddie, beaten by a guard named Quillan, steals the guard's gun, knocks him out and leads a revolt. The only one able to quell the uprising is Furman, who, with Kitty's help, successfully appeals to Eddie to give up before it's too late.

The building has a transitional design in two respects, as it reflects the change from early European-influenced mills to 20th-century American mills as well as the move from smaller rural mills to large mills built along railroads. The mill features a masonry bearing-wall style of construction, a concrete foundation considered novel at the time, and well-crafted masonry and woodwork.

The movement was heavily influenced by modern English literature, and started by young Burmese writers, many of whom like Myo Min were educated in Christian missionary schools.Swan Yi : 4 Starting in 1935, under the pen name of Nwe Soe, he wrote several short stories and articles, as well as a few poems, in magazines associated with the Khit-San movement‚ÄîKyipwayay (, \\"Growth\\") Magazine by Ludu U Hla and Ganda Lawka (, \\"World of Books\\") Magazine by JS Furnivall.

Its members have brought information about wikipedia's controversies to the attention of the media. The site was founded in March 2012 by users of wikipedia Review, another site critical of wikipedia. The site is \\"known for digging up dirt on wikipedia's top brass\\", wrote reporter Kevin Morris in the Daily Dot. Novelist Amanda Filipacchi wrote in The Wall Street Journal that the site \\"intelligently discusses and entertainingly lambastes wikipedia‚Äôs problematic practices\\".  Website user activism  Wikipediocracy contributors have investigated problems, conflicts, and controversies associated with wikipedia, some being reported by mainstream media. The site's stated mission is \\"to shine the light of scrutiny into the dark crevices of wikipedia\\" and related projects. In a doctoral thesis, Heather Ford, a specialist in Internet policy and law, commented on Wikipediocracy's role, saying, \\"As wikipedia's authority grows, and more groups feel disenfranchised by its processes, the growth of watchdog groups like Wikipediocracy who act as translators of wikipedia's complex structures, rules and norms for mainstream media and who begin to give voice to those who feel that they have been excluded from wikipedia's representational structures will continue.\\"Ford, Heather, \\"Fact factories: wikipedia and the power to represent\\", Kellogg College, Oxford, August 2015, DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.1.4068.9361  Revenge editing  In 2013, Wikipediocracy members contacted Salon.com reporter Andrew Leonard to alert him about the \\"Qworty fiasco\\". User Qworty had attracted attention for his provocative comments in a debate on wikipedia's treatment of female writers. It emerged that many of his past contributions affected the site's treatment of (and targeted rivals of) writer Robert Clark Young. This background information led to Leonard's challenging Young, in an article \\"Revenge, Ego, and the Corruption of wikipedia\\", which identified Young as Qworty. Just before the publication of Leonard's article, because of this behavior, Qworty had been banned from editing wikipedia biographies of living persons.  Discussion of governments  Wikipediocracy contributors' criticisms of wikipedia have been discussed in news stories covering Jimmy Wales's relationship with the government of Kazakhstan, the Gibraltarpedia controversy, and an anonymous edit made from a U.S. Senate IP address that labelled whistle-blower Edward Snowden a \\"traitor\\". In May 2014, The Telegraph, working with Wikipediocracy, uncovered evidence identifying the civil servant who had allegedly vandalized the wikipedia articles on the Hillsborough disaster and Anfield.  Wikimedia Foundation  A Wikipediocracy blog post reported in 2013 that wikipedia was being vandalized from IP addresses assigned to the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF). Responding to the allegations, WMF spokesman Jay Walsh stated that the IP addresses belonged to WMF servers and were not used by the WMF offices. He stated that the addresses were assigned to some edits by IPs due to a misconfiguration, which was corrected.  Other issues  A Wikipediocracy forum discussion identified the wikipedia account responsible for a hoax article wikipedia administrators had recently deleted. The \\"Bicholim conflict\\" article described a fictitious 1640‚Äì41 Indian civil war. It was awarded wikipedia's \\"Good article\\" status in 2007, and retained it until late 2012, when a wikipedian checked the article's cited sources and found that none of them appeared to exist. A September 2013 story resulting from a Wikipediocracy tip-off concerned commercial plastic surgeons editing wikipedia's plastic surgery articles to promote their services. Concerns with violations of conflict of interest guidelines and the provision of misinformation in the relevant articles had also been raised by Wikipediocracy members on wikipedia itself. In February 2015, wikipedia's Arbitration Committee banned a user after finding he had edited to promote the Indian Institute of Planning and Management and added negative material to the article on another university. The user's edits had been noted in Wikipediocracy in December 2013.

The film was released in theaters on October 30, 2013. Plot Like his swimming champion father, Won-il (Seo In-guk) was once a promising swimmer. But when his father dies during a swimming competition (where he was doing his specialty called \\"no breathing\\"), followed soon after by his mother's death, Won-il quits swimming for good. Instead, he lives life hopelessly and recklessly, like there is no tomorrow. With Won-il in danger of being expelled from school, his father's longtime friend Jae-suk (Park Chul-min) drags him to a physical education-focused high school, hoping that he'll start swimming again. There he meets his long-ago rival, Woo-sang (Lee Jong-suk) who in the past had always been overshadowed by Won-il. With Won-il's absence from the sport, Woo-sang is now in first place and is a national swimming star. But he gets disqualified from the national tryouts after getting into trouble, so he has to start from ground zero and ends up at the same phys-ed school as Won- il. Woo-sang is Won-il's complete opposite in personality, and all he cares about is winning so he finds Won-il's return to the sport unwelcome. Then there is Jae-suk's daughter, Jung-eun (Kwon Yuri) who captures both Won-il and Woo-sang's hearts and further reignites the rivalry between them.

The film was released by United Artists.\\"Overview: 'The Flight that Disappeared'.\\" Turner Classic Movies. Retrieved: March 21, 2017. The film's storyline deals with an alien abduction. When his flight disappears, a rocket scientist finds himself on trial in the future for his part in designing a weapon that has destroyed all life on Earth. Plot Trans-Coast Airways Flight 60 leaves Los Angeles on a flight to Washington, D.C. Three scientists on board the transcontinental flight have been summoned to a classified meeting at the Pentagon, concerning the \\"beta bomb\\", a new bomb design and the rocket to deliver it. Mid-flight, the Douglas DC-6 airliner mysteriously begins to climb, to over 10 miles high. Back at the airline headquarters, Operations Manager Hank Norton (John Bryant) tries to keep in contact with the flight, but is sure that nothing can be done to save the passengers and crew. The engines stop, and passengers pass out due to lack of oxygen. Crazed passenger Walter Cooper (Harvey Stephens) who has tried to convince others that using the secret bomb is essential, jumps from the aircraft. Three scientists, Dr. Carl Morris (Dayton Lummis), Tom Endicott (Craig Hill) and Marcia Paxton (Paula Raymond) find themselves in a limbo state, watches stopped and no heartbeats. Meeting the Examiner (Gregory Morton), the trio of scientists leave the aircraft for judgement from those of the future. They find themselves in a moment between time, which explains the stopped watches and lack of heartbeats. They are shown, in brief, a future where their bomb has been used and having destroyed the atmosphere, has killed off all life on the planet. They are judged guilty and sentenced to live in the moment with no time for the rest of eternity, where the future and past meet. After the Sage (Addison Richards) objects that the scientists from the past cannot be judged by a future society, they are returned to the present on this technicality. The passengers have no memory of any of the actions on board before passing out, with the exception of Endicott, the rocket engineer and Dr. Morris. Marcia Paxton only thinks the event was a dream. Walter Cooper reappears, and the flight crew do not seem to have any recall of the emergency that took place on the flight. When Captain Hank Norton (John Bryant) calls for landing instructions, the airline office is perplexed. When their airliner lands at Washington, the passengers and crew discover they are 24 hours late, thus proving Endicott's fantastic story of the trial and judgement. Dr. Morris, the nuclear bomb designer, disposes of his notebook containing the formulas and designs for the bomb.

The collapse led to a number of important cases for English trusts law and UK company law, including Barlow Clowes International Ltd v Vaughan and Barlow Clowes International Ltd v Eurotrust International Ltd. History Around 18,000 customers invested their money with Barlow Clowes on the recommendation of intermediaries. The company was established as a 'bond-washing' operation, in which gilt-edged Government bonds were purchased and sold in order to create tax advantages. Investors believed that their money had been invested risk-free. However, much of the money was diverted to fund the extravagant lifestyle of the company's co-founder, Peter Clowes. After increasing concern about the operations of Barlow Clowes, the Department of Trade and Industry launched an investigation. On the strength of the evidence uncovered, Barlow Clowes was wound up by the High Court in May 1988, owing ¬£190 million. Many of the victims were retired people who had lost the entirety of their life savings who now faced hardship or poverty. Peter Clowes was ultimately convicted of fraud and theft and sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years. The press reported that the Department, as the licensing authority, had ignored warnings about Barlow Clowes from both the company's competitors and from reputable sources in the City. It was alleged that the Department knew as early as 1984 that Barlow Clowes was trading without a licence, that it gave the company a licence in 1985, and renewed it in both 1986 and 1987. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Lord Young sought to defuse the matter in June 1988 by appointing Sir Godfray Le Quesne QC to hold an independent inquiry to determine the facts of what happened within the Department. The Le Quesne report was published in October 1988. Young announced that the Department had acted reasonably in the circumstances and that the Government had no liability to the investors. Backbench MPs from all sides of the House voiced their anger and dismay at the attitude of the Government and the narrowness of the Le Quesne report's terms of reference. Twelve MPs referred the matter to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. Anthony Barrowclough conducted an investigation into the actions of the Department of Trade and Industry in licensing the Barlow Clowes group of companies. He established a unit dedicated to cope with the demands of the case. Barrowclough published his 170-page, 120,000-word report in December 1989. It identified irregularities in the affairs of Barlow Clowes which dated back to the 1970s and concluded that the Department had committed five acts of maladministration. It was concluded that if departmental officials had examined the affairs of the business properly in 1985 on the basis of the warnings the Department had received, it was a virtual certainty that they would have closed Barlow Clowes down. The Report stated that it was the most complex, wide-ranging and onerous investigation ever undertaken by the Office.Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, Annual Report 1988-89, pp. 22-23 The case attracted unprecedented press and Parliamentary attention, with between 150 and 200 MPs contacting the Office. Nicholas Ridley, who had replaced Young as Secretary of State, rejected the main thrust of Barrowclough's findings and claimed that departmental officials had acted correctly on external advice. Nevertheless, Ridley reversed the position that the Government would not bailout investors, announcing a compensation package that would guarantee investors of less than ¬£50,000 a 90% refund. In all, the Government agreed to pay ¬£150 million to investors. Ridley, out of political expediency, added the caveat that the payment of compensation was purely because of the recommendation of the Parliamentary Commissioner.Hansard, HC Debate, 19 December 1989, vol 164 c212) Through his investigation, Barrowclough had forced the Government to change its attitude towards the investors, compensating them for the great majority of their losses. The thoroughness in which he had investigated, a practice for which Barrowclough had hitherto been criticised, had helped secure justice for the victims of Barlow Clowes and the biggest compensation payment ever procured by the Office.

Dibrugarh Railway Station (DBRG) is the second railway station of the historic city of Dibrugarh after Dibrugarh Town railway station (DBRT). Overview In her book Urban History of India: A Case Study Deepali Barua writes: \\"Dibrugarh was made the district headquarters in 1840. But it was not only for strategic importance that it soon became so important. The greatest interest of the British in Assam was the commerce centering around it. As early as 1823 the British discovered tea in the modern Sadiya region. It was at Chabua, 20 miles to the east of Dibrugarh that the British made their first experiments with tea cultivation with indigenous plants. Very soon oil and coal were discovered in areas near to Dibrugarh town. Oil was discovered at Digboi in 1882 and coal was found at Margherita in 1876. All these greatly enhanced the importance of Dibrugarh as a centre of industrial, commercial, and administrative activities.\\"Urban History of India: A Case-Study by Deepali Barua, pages 4, 79-80, , Mittal Publications, A-110 Mohan Garden, New Delhi ‚Äì 110059 History The -wide metre-gauge line from Dibrugarh steamer ghat to Makum was opened to passenger traffic on 16 July 1883.

H. L. Mencken called him \\"the best managing editor in America.\\" He was also a prolific writer and editor. Career Background Angoff was born on April 22, 1902 in Minsk, then Russia (now Belarus). His father was a tailor named John Jacob Angoff; his mother was named Anna Pollack. In 1908, the Angoffs left Russia and settled near Boston, Massachusetts. By age 12, he began writing poetry. He became a naturalized citizen in 1923. He studied at Harvard University from 1919 to 1923 on a scholarship and majored in philosophy. Journalism In 1923, Angoff began his career in journalism at a local weekly. He answered an advertisement by H. L. Mencken, who hired him as an assistant in 1925. He worked on the editorial staff of Mencken's American Mercury magazine until 1931, when he became managing editor. He wrote articles for the magazine, either signing them with pseudonyms or publishing them anonymously. Mencken and publisher Alfred Knopf felt Angoff was too leftist and sold the magazine privately in January 1935. Angoff joined the editorial board of The Nation magazine and then became editor of American Spectator until it folded in 1937. From 1943 to 1951, he served as managing editor of the American Mercury. Writing During his final years at the American Mercury, Angoff began publishing more books. When the magazine closed in 1951, he began publishing a series about the Polonskys, a family of assimilating, immigrant Jews. It started with Journey to the Dawn (1951). The trilogy grew to eleven volumes and unfinished twelfth. He wrote a rather controversial biography, H. L. Mencken: A Portrait from Memory (1956) about the subject's anti-Semitism. He wrote several books of poetry. Academics In the mid-1950s, Angoff became an English professor at Fairleigh Dickinson University. He co-founded the quarterly The Literary Review and helped found the Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, launched in 1967. He retired in 1976 to the Upper West Side of New York City. Awards received Angoff was appointed to the Board of Trustees of New York City Community College. He received an honorary Doctor of Letters from Fairleigh Dickinson University (June 1966). In 1954, He received the National Jewish Book Award for In the Morning Lighth and again in 1969 for Memory of Autumn. Angoff received various other awards (1954-1977). Charles Angoff Award The Literary Review offers an annual Charles Angoff Award for outstanding contributions to the magazine during his tenure as editor from 1957 to 1976. Communist leanings According to Whittaker Chambers in his 1952 memoir, Angoff worked closely with him, Maxim Lieber, and John Loomis Sherman after they formed the American Feature Writers Syndicate, a front for communist underground agents as overseas cover. Chambers wrote: > Among Lieber's friends was an editor of the American Mercury (not Eugene > Lyons, who was still a U .P. correspondent in Moscow) . He gladly furnished > a letter telling all whom it might concern that Charles F. Chase was a news > gatherer for the Mercury. During testimony, members of HUAC identified Angoff as the Mercury person by asking: * Of John Sherman - \\"Did you attend a luncheon with Maxim Lieber, Charles Angoff, and Whittaker Chambers in which you discussed these credentials and the purpose of them?\\" * Of Maxim Lieber - \\"Did you attend a luncheon with Charles Angoff and Whittaker Chambers at which you discussed the matter of obtaining credentials for Sherman?\\" Personal life Angoff married Sara Freedman in June 1943. They had a daughter, Nancy Angoff. In 1967, his daughter published Marxism and the English Peasants of 1381: a Dream Deferred. He died on May 3, 1979, aged 77, survived by his wife and daughter. Works In his writings, Angoff may have become best known for his non-fiction and fiction works concerning his former boss, H. L. Mencken, and associate George Jean Nathan. As Time magazine wrote in 1961, \\"Having fanged his ex-idol non- fictionally in H. L. Mencken: A Portrait from Memory, Angoff releases some fictional venom in The Bitter Spring. Mencken is portrayed as a loud-mouthed vulgarian and an intellectual fraud with but a single saving grace, his love of music...\\" by the name of \\"Harry P. Brandt.\\" Regarding his editing of the writings of Nathan, Time wrote, \\"Mercury associate, Charles Angoff, has reached back over 34 years, dusted off Nathan's personal Five-Foot Shelf of writings (some 39 books) and pieced together a Nathan sampler. Sipped, The World of George Jean Nathan is a delight; swallowed, it leaves a faintly rusty taste on the palate, like water too long in the taps. With malice toward some, Nathan has his say on every subject under his sun.\\" The following books appear in the Library of Congress.

He joined the Com√©diens du Roi under Gros-Guillaume at the H√¥tel de Bourgogne in 1622. He had a fine speaking voice and performed leading parts in comedies and tragedies, and also acted as the 'orator', the member of the company who formally addressed the audience. Some contemporaries regarded Bellerose as \\"insipid and affected\\" and preferred his arch-rival, the more aggressive Montdory at the Th√©√¢tre du Marais. After Gros-Guillaume's death in 1634, Bellerose became the leader of the Com√©diens du Roi at the Bourgogne and remained in that position until 1647, when he is thought to have sold his interest in the company for a very high price to his brother-in-law Floridor.

Then one of the crew spots the antenna of a German tank from World War II sprouting from the sands.

A young American volunteer in the British Army Sergeant Tom Cutler is sent northwards carrying a dispatch which orders the garrison of Fort Williams to reinforce the vulnerable Crown Point outpost.

Nat and Sagamore enlist as scouts for the reinforcements being sent out to Fort Williams. They escort the British Captain West carrying important despatches, and Marion Thorne, the daughter of the Fort's commander. They foil an attempt by Ogane to betray them to the Hurons and bring them safety to Fort Williams. However, their apparent insubordination leaves their commander's suspicious of their loyalty. General Montcalm is being supplied with information by a spy inside the Fort, which is carried out to him by Ogane. Montcalm ambushes a force of American infantry and advances with the French Army to lay siege to the Fort. Hawkeye is able to expose the traitor as Captain Brownwell a French-born officer serving as quartermaster to the British forces, but is too late to stop further information passing out to Montcalm. Aware that the Fort is indefensible, Montcalm offers it favorable peace terms. This outrages Ogane who wants vengeance against the Anglo-Americans, and he leads his Hurons in a night attack in which they kill many of the Fort's defenders. Marion Thorne is kidnapped by Ogane who wants her as his wife. Hawkeye, Captain West and Sagamore follow the Hurons and rescue Marion. They are then pursued by Ogane until they reach the shelter of the Ottawa tribe, rivals of the Hurons. The Ottawa leader suggests they can go free if one of them can defeat Ogane in single combat. Hawkeye fights and kills Ogane, and they are allowed to return home. Hawkeye is appointed as chief scout to the British forces as they prepare a fresh offensive for the following year.

The film is based on the 1921 play of the same name by Wilson Collison and Avery Hopwood. The play was previously adapted for the screen as a silent film released in 1927 by Metropolitan Pictures and starred Marie Prevost and Charles Ray. Plot Dr. Kenneth B. Ford (Dennis O'Keefe) is researching a revolutionary new anesthetic at Boston Mass Hospital. He receives news that he is about to be awarded by being elected into the Society of Scientific Research and is overjoyed. His joy is lessened however, by the arrival of district attorney investigator Winters (Frank Fenton), and the news that he is investigating a big jewel theft. Winters wants to question Kenneth about a piece of jewelry he bought two years earlier, but Kenneth says he doesn't recall anything of the sort. Winters suspects Kenneth of not telling the whole truth, and calls him to testify in court the next day. Right after Winter leaves, Kenneth calls his former girlfriend Gertie Kettering (Marie McDonald), an artist, and enquires about the jeweled garter she got from him two years earlier. It had an inscription on it: \\"To Gertie from Ken, with all my love\\". Kenneth is now happily married to Patty (Sheila Ryan), and doesn't want his gift to Gertie to be known to his wife, which would cause a scandal on his behalf. Kenneth wants Gertie to give back the garter to him. Gertie tells him his request is impossible, since she is about to wear the garter at her wedding the following day, and she has already sent away it to Ipswich where the wedding is taking place. Patty is waiting for Kenneth at the laboratory when he gets back to perform his research experiment. Patty understands from Kenneth's behavior that something is wrong. She gets jealous of Gertie and follows Kenneth when he goes to Ipswich that night, to visit his best friend Ted Dalton (Barry Sullivan), who is marrying Gertie. When Kenneth and Ted talk about the garter, Gertie eavesdrops on them and comes to believe that Ted would disapprove of the fact that she has accepted a gift from another man. Gertie demands that Kenneth tells Ted the truth, and she decides to keep the garter in case she needs to prove her innocence. Kenneth refuses, determined to keep the garter a secret to his wife. Instead he plans to take the garter back. Patty sees the discussion between Kenneth and Gertie, and gets more jealous. When she falls into a water barrel, Gertie's brother-in-law Billy (Jerome Cowan) helps her with dry clothes, and his wife Barbara (Binnie Barnes) becomes jealous of them when she sees them in the barn. The butler has gotten hold of the garter and wants to use it to blackmail Kenneth. Eventually Ted sees Kenneth and Gertie together, and later Kenneth finds Patty with no clothes in the barn, and Barbara discovers Billy covered only in hay. In vain, Kenneth and Gertie try to explain about the jewelry theft investigation. Everyone is jealous of everyone else, and no one trust their respective partners anymore. Then the butler appears with the garter, and everyone believes Kenneth and Gertie. Everyone makes up with their partner and all is well.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/76173/Getting-Gertie-s-Garter/ Cast *Dennis O'Keefe as Dr. Kenneth B.

Small had a deal with United Artists. Howard Emmett Rogers was working on the script. In August 1938 Small sent a unit under John Burch to film in second unit footage in American Samoa. In March 1939 Small announced the film as part of his $5 million seven-film program for 1939‚Äì40. (The other movies would be Kit Carson, Two Years Before the Mast, Valentino, Quantrill, My Son, My Son and Food of the Gods. Small would end up only making a few of these.) For a time it seemed Clayton Moore might be cast instead of Hall. Filming was to begin on 1 September 1939. Tom Neal and Diane Lewis joined the cast. Filming was pushed back to 15 September so Small could borrow director Charles Vidor from Columbia. Eventually Small decided to put Vidor on My Son, My Son instead, feeling he was better suited to that. In February 1940 Victor McLaglen was signed to costar alongside Clayton Moore and Alfred Werker was signed to direct. Moore did not appear in the final film. Small borrowed Frances Farmer to play the female lead; Farmer had been fighting with Paramount over roles and it was reported that this would be her last film under her Paramount contract. Rita Hayworth was discussed for the role of the lead native girl. Olympe Bradne ended up playing it. Shooting Filming eventually began 26 March 1940. Locations included Balboa Beach with underwater scenes shot at Santa Catalina.author=On 3 April it was reported that Werker had \\"retired as director\\" after an \\"argument over the script.\\" He was replaced by Alfred E. Green. Green had directed Farmer in her last film, Ride a Crooked Mile and described her as a \\"different girl\\" on this one. After completion of the film, Hall immediately went into Kit Carson for Small. Reception Reviews were poor. The New York Times listed it as among the worst films of the year.

Yelchin plays Brian, a 24-year-old writer who has an affair with a 33-year-old married French woman, Arielle (Marlohe). Arielle and her middle-aged husband, Val√©ry (Wilson), have an agreement allowing them to have extramarital affairs as long as they are confined to the hours between 5 and 7 p.m. The film's premise was inspired by a French couple in an open marriage whom Levin met in the 1980s. Though he completed the film's first draft in 2007, the project remained in development for seven further years due to casting issues. Diane Kruger was initially cast as Arielle but was replaced by Marlohe. Filming began in May 2013 in New York City and mainly took place on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The film's score was composed by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans. 5 to 7 was premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 19, 2014. It was also screened at the 2014 Traverse City Film Festival, where it won the Audience Award for Best American Film. The film was released theatrically on April 3, 2015 by IFC Films. It grossed $674,579 at the worldwide box office and received mixed reviews from critics. Plot Brian Bloom (Anton Yelchin), a struggling 24-year-old writer in New York City, meets a 33-year-old French woman named Arielle Pierpont (B√©r√©nice Marlohe). They feel powerfully attracted to one another. After their second meeting, Arielle reveals that she is married to a much older diplomat, Val√©ry (Lambert Wilson), and they have two young children. Arielle and Val√©ry have an agreement that each is permitted to have extramarital affairs as long as they are limited to the time between 5 and 7 p.m. on weeknights. Brian is perplexed at this information and tells Arielle that he cannot continue the relationship with her, believing it is an unethical affair. Arielle says that, should he change his mind, she will continue to smoke on Fridays at the same place they met. After three weeks Brian decides to meet again with Arielle. She gives him a hotel key and in the evening at the hotel room they consummate their relationship. They begin to meet regularly at the same hotel room in the evenings. Val√©ry, who is aware of Brian's affair with Arielle, approaches him on the street and invites Brian to his house for dinner. At dinner, Brian meets Arielle and Val√©ry's children and is introduced to Val√©ry's lover, a 25-year-old editor named Jane (Olivia Thirlby). Arielle later meets Brian's parents, Sam (Frank Langella) and Arlene (Glenn Close). Upon learning that Arielle is a married mother of two, Sam tells Brian that he disapproves of the relationship, while Arlene accepts that they love each other despite the circumstances. When Brian is invited to a New Yorker ceremony to receive an award for one of his short stories, he is joined by Arielle, Val√©ry, Jane, and his parents. Jane tells Brian that her boss Galassi (Eric Stoltz), a publisher, has read his story and wants Brian to write a novel. Brian meets Arielle at the hotel and asks her to marry him, giving her a ring. Brian insists that he is truly in love with her, and Arielle accepts his proposal, telling him to meet her the next day at the hotel. Val√©ry shows up at Brian's apartment that night; he slaps Brian and expresses anger at Brian's betrayal of the rules and boundaries of an open marriage. He then gives Brian a check for $250,000 for Brian to give Arielle the life she deserves and leaves. The next day, the hotel doorman gives Brian a letter from Arielle in which she explains that although she loves him deeply, she cannot leave her husband and children, and asks him not to contact her again. Jane later ends her relationship with Val√©ry because it feels like a betrayal of her friendship with Brian, and Brian's first novel is published by Galassi. After some years, Brian is walking down the street with his wife, Kiva (Jocelyn DeBoer), and their two-year-old son. They run into Arielle, Val√©ry and their now-teenage children outside the Guggenheim. Val√©ry asks about Jane, and Brian tells him that she is married with a son. Arielle shows Brian subtly that she still wears the ring he gave to her before they part again.

The couple had an open marriage; each spouse had an extramarital lover and, according to Levin, \\"they were all terribly civilized with the arrangement\\". After meeting the couple, Levin \\"filed away\\" the idea until he could work out how to incorporate it into a larger story. He conceived the complete plot after his children's birth in the early 2000s. Levin wrote the first draft of the film in March 2007. His agent at William Morris Endeavor introduced him to Julie Lynn, who read the script and agreed to produce it. In 2011, Lynn partnered with Bonnie Curtis, who also became a producer on the film. The project remained in development for seven years due to difficulties in finding appropriately \\"box office-eligible\\" actors whose schedules lined up. The budget was primarily financed by Demarest Films, with additional funding from private investors including Sam Englebardt, David Greathouse and Bill Johnson. Levin approached Anton Yelchin to star in 5 to 7 after seeing the actor's performance in the 2011 film Like Crazy. He wrote Yelchin a \\"beseeching\\" letter asking him to accept the role; Yelchin never received the letter but nevertheless agreed to star in the film. In 2012, it was announced that Diane Kruger had been cast as Yelchin's lover, but she was later replaced by B√©r√©nice Marlohe. Glenn Close was cast through Curtis and Lynn, who had produced Close's 2011 film Albert Nobbs and remained close friends with her. The film also features cameo appearances from several prominent New Yorkers: civil rights activist Julian Bond, chef Daniel Boulud, New York Philharmonic conductor Alan Gilbert and The New Yorker editor David Remnick. Filming was originally scheduled to begin in February 2013, but was delayed until May 2013. The film was shot by cinematographer Arnaud Potier on an Arri Alexa camera in CinemaScope widescreen format. Levin and Potier decided to use minimalistic wide shots and long takes to avoid \\"reminding the audience that it's a movie\\" with unnecessary cuts. Filming mainly took place on the Upper East Side of New York City. Specific filming locations included the Carlyle Hotel, the St. Regis Hotel, The Guggenheim, Fifth Avenue, Grand Army Plaza, Le Charlot restaurant and Crawford Doyle Booksellers. The only major location used outside of the Upper East Side was Brian's apartment, which was filmed on 30th Street in Midtown Manhattan. Shots of plaques on Central Park benches are interspersed throughout the film; Levin sent a group of interns to find interesting inscriptions on the benches in Central Park and selected about thirty that were filmed on the last day of shooting. The crew adopted a bench of their own whose plaque is shown at the end of the film's credits. Levin initially planned to use a jazz soundtrack but found classical music more apt after completing the filming. He hired Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans to compose the film's score, which consisted of two main melodies, one a waltz and the other a more classical theme.  Release  5 to 7 premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 19, 2014, and went on to be screened at the Traverse City Film Festival, Savannah Film Festival, Denver Film Festival, Palm Springs International Film Festival, Cinequest Film Festival, Hamptons International Film Festival, Carmel International Film Festival, Virginia Film Festival Boulder International Film Festival, and Bermuda International Film Festival. It won the Audience Award for Best American Film at the Traverse City Film Festival, and was nominated for Best Narrative Feature at the Bermuda International Film Festival. IFC Films acquired the United States distribution rights to the film in June 2014. It was released theatrically on April 3, 2015 in New York and Los Angeles, grossing $18,006 from two locations on its opening weekend. It later expanded to 27 theaters and earned a total of $162,685 from six weeks in American theaters. Outside the United States, the film was most successful in Mexico (where it grossed $259,757) and Russia (where it grossed $120,909); it earned a total of $511,894 internationally, making a total worldwide gross of $674,579.  Reception  On the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, 5 to 7 holds a 70% approval rating based on 50 reviews with an average rating of 5.7/10. The site's consensus states: \\"5 to 7 too often settles for rom-com clich√©s, but they're offset by its charming stars, sensitive direction, and a deceptively smart screenplay.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 52 out of 100 based on reviews from 22 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". The San Francisco Chronicle Mick LaSalle enjoyed the film and praised Marlohe's performance in particular. He felt that 5 to 7 was \\"in that rare category of romantic drama that seems aimed for a male audience\\", comparing Yelchin's role to that of Kristen Stewart in The Twilight Saga. Variety critic Peter Debruge commended Levin for his \\"earnest, heart-on-his- sleeve approach\\", referring to the film as \\"courageously sentimental in an age of irony\\". He also highlighted the \\"elegant, traditional\\" classical score and minimalist cinematography. John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter opined that 5 to 7 was \\"sumptuous and romantic in an attractively old-fashioned way\\" despite its clich√©d plot devices. He praised Potier's \\"dreamily hazy\\" cinematography and Yelchin's performance. Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times found the film \\"charm[ing]\\" in spite of what it lacked in plot and character development. She credited the cinematography, music, production design and costumes with giving the film \\"a kind of gauzy loveliness\\". Peter Keough, who awarded the film 2.5 out of 4 stars for The Boston Globe, felt that the film relied on stereotypes and clich√© but nevertheless offered \\"refreshing innovations\\" to the romance genre. He praised Marlohe's performance and the comic relief provided by \\"the oddly but perfectly cast Glenn Close and Frank Langella\\". The New York Times chief film critic Manohla Dargis found the plot of 5 to 7 to be inauthentic and the characters \\"unpersuasive\\". She criticized Marlohe's \\"opaque, physically stiff\\" performance and the similarities of the film to Woody Allen's Manhattan-based works. The Washington Post Ann Hornaday also felt that the film lacked authenticity, writing that it \\"feels more constructed than lived\\". She praised Yelchin's \\"modest, endearing lead performance\\" but found Arielle's character underdeveloped. Rodrigo Perez of The Playlist referred to 5 to 7 as \\"groan-worthy\\", \\"sappy and painfully jejune.\\" He found the premise implausible and melodramatic and Brian's character uninteresting and two-dimensional, a stand-in for \\"an adolescent male fantasy\\". The Village Voice Amy Nicholson also felt that Brian was an unsympathetic character and that his relationship with Arielle was not believable. She criticized the film's reliance on national stereotypes and the \\"artistic-martyr trope\\".

The film focuses on American musician and civil rights activist Nina Simone, portrayed by Zoe Saldana. The film also stars David Oyelowo, Ella Thomas, and Mike Epps. The film was released on April 22, 2016, in a limited release and through video on demand by RLJ Entertainment. The film was met with heavy criticism and Simone's family refused to endorse the film. Saldana later said she regretted accepting the lead role. Plot In 1988 Nina Simone is financially unsound, mentally unstable and an alcoholic. Her 1960s heyday is far behind her. After threatening a lawyer with a gun, she is forcibly committed to a Los Angeles psychiatric hospital for twenty-four hours. While in the hospital, Nina hires orderly Clifton Henderson (David Oyelowo) as an assistant. He accompanies her back to Bouc-Bel-Air, France. Nina drinks heavily and refuses to take her medication. She proves to be difficult and confrontational. She verbally abuses Clifton, assaults a patron at a nightclub performance and makes Clifton get her random men with whom she has one-night stands. Her behavior drives Clifton back home to America. Nina is told by her doctor that the results of a biopsy are serious and she needs treatment for cancer. Nina arrives unannounced at Clifton's family home in Chicago, much to the amusement of his family and his embarrassment. She tells Clifton that she wants him to be her manager. He is hesitant, but agrees to work for her again. Clifton attempts to book shows in France, but nearly no one wants to deal with Nina's difficult behavior. Nonetheless, his efforts eventually pay off and she performs marvelously at a gig. He gets a studio and she begins recording new music. It is implied that they begin a sexual relationship. Worried about her health, he convinces her to undergo surgery for her cancer. Once recovered, Nina returns to America for a live performance in Central Park. A crowd flocks to see her and she opens her concert with the song \\"Feeling Good.\\" Cast * Zoe Saldana as Nina Simone * David Oyelowo as Clifton Henderson * Kevin Mambo as Gilles * Ronald Guttman as Henri Edwards * Chuma Gault as Nina's Husband * Mike Epps as Richard Pryor * Ella Joyce as Clifton's Mom * Ella Thomas as Lorraine Hansberry * Marianne Muellerleile as Nurse Mary * Yasmine Golchan as Doctor Cousier * Siena Goines as Heather * Camille Natta as Michelle Laroche * Michael Vartan as Radio Interviewer Production Development In May 2010, it was announced Mary J. Blige and David Oyelowo had been cast in the film as Nina Simone, and Clifton Henderson respectively, with Cynthia Mort directing the film from a screenplay she had written, and production planned for September of that year. In August 2012, it was announced that Zoe Saldana, who is Afro-Latina, had been cast in the film, replacing Blige as Simone, Blige having exited due to financial issues with the project. The casting of Saldana caused controversy, with Simone Kelly, Simone's daughter, saying, \\"My mother was raised at a time when she was told her nose was too wide, her skin was too dark. Appearance-wise this is not the best choice.\\" In 2014, Mort had begun taking legal action after being cut out of the decision-making process, making her unhappy with the project she spent several years developing. Filming Production was originally scheduled to begin in September 2010 in France. Principal photography began on October 16, 2012, in Los Angeles, California. Dark makeup, a prosthetic nose and false teeth had been added to Saldana to play Simone. Release In September 2015, RLJ Entertainment acquired U.S distribution rights to the film with a planned December 2015 release. The film was released on April 22, 2016, in a limited release and through video on demand. After the film's trailer had been released, Simone's estate's Twitter account tweeted at Saldana, writing, \\"Please take Nina's name out of your mouth. For the rest of your life. Hopefully people begin to understand this is painful. Gut-wrenching, heartbreaking, nauseating, soul- crushing. It shall pass, but for now.\\" Robert L. Johnson, the chairman and founder of RLJ, issued a statement, saying, \\"Zoe Saldana delivers an exceptional and mesmerizing tribute to Nina Simone. She gave her heart and soul to the role and displayed her extraordinary talent. The most important thing is that creativity or quality of performance should never be judged on the basis of color, or ethnicity, or physical likeness. Quality entertainment should be measured by the sheer force of creativity and the commitment that an actor or actress brings to the performance.\\" Reception On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 2% based on 43 reviews, with an average rating of 3.27/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"A wholly misguided tribute to its subject's searing talent and enduring impact, Nina is the cinematic equivalent of a covers project featuring all the wrong artists.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 27 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". In August 2020, Saldana said she regretted taking on the role. Having previously defended the role, Saldana, who identifies as Afro-Latina, said, \\"I should have never played Nina. I should have done everything in my power, with the leverage that I had 10 years ago [was] a different leverage but it was leverage nonetheless.

Altiere, Steven M. Altiere, and Malcolm T. Goldman. It features the voices of Rob Schneider, Heather Graham, Ken Jeong, Colm Meaney, Loretta Devine, Gabriel Iglesias, Michael McElhatton, and Bill Nighy, and is an international co-production of the United States, India, and Ireland. The UK version of the film features the voice of James Corden instead of Michael McElhatton. It was produced by Assemblage Entertainment, Splash Entertainment and Telegael, and distributed by Lionsgate. The film was theatrically released on January 15, 2016, and grossed $30 million on an $18 million budget. Norm of the North was panned by critics and audiences for its animation, plot, characters, writing, voice acting and humor. It temporarily held a rating of 0% (at 9% as of July 2020) on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes. There are three direct-to-DVD sequels: Norm of the North: Keys to the Kingdom, released January 11, 2019, Norm of the North: King Sized Adventure, released June 11, 2019, and Norm of the North: Family Vacation, released February 25, 2020. Plot Norm the polar bear is the son of the King of the Arctic. In his youth, he discovers that he has the ability to speak to humans, a trait shared only by his grandfather. Because of this, he is made an outcast from the other animals, only being accepted by Socrates, a wise seagull, and Elizabeth, a female polar bear whom Norm is in love with. Years later, Norm's grandfather has disappeared and human tourists are filling the Arctic. Socrates shows Norm and three Arctic lemmings a luxury condo that has been installed on the ice. Inside this condo is Vera, a representative for wealthy developer Mr. Greene. After Norm saves Vera from an avalanche, Mr. Greene tells her to find an actor to play a polar bear for their campaign. Socrates convinces Norm and the lemmings to stow away on a ship to New York City. In the city, Norm, pretending to be an actor dressed as a bear, auditions for Mr. Greene's commercial and is taken to dinner by Vera. Greene, who realizes that Norm is a real bear, suspects that Norm has come to free his grandfather, whom Greene has captured. During a public incident involving Greene trying to shoot Norm with a tranquilizer gun in the restaurant, Norm subdues Greene, gaining the attention of the media and heightening Greene's approval ratings. Greene decides to hire Norm as his mascot. Before going on a television show, Norm meets Vera's daughter Olympia, who tells Norm to raise Greene's approval ratings and then speak out against him to save the Arctic. Norm's popularity heightens the approval ratings, but Greene sabotages Norm's plan by playing recorded dialogue stating that Norm supports Greene's developments. Defeated, Norm is comforted by Vera and Olympia, who reveals that Greene is developing more homes to install in the Arctic. Norm and the lemmings discover that Greene is bribing a high-ranking member of the Polar Council, and exposes this to Pablo, one of Greene's investors. Vera resigns her position and is hired by Pablo, while Norm and the lemmings chase the truck holding the houses. Greene sends another truck carrying Norm's dead grandfather, and Norm is captured as well. After being freed by the lemmings, Norm carries his grandfather's body up to the boat carrying the houses to the Arctic, and is able to detach the houses. However, Norm is separated from his grandfather's body. Norm awakens in the Arctic and is reunited with the lemmings and the other animals, who reveal that his grandfather was dead. Because of his heroism, Norm is crowned the King of the Arctic, but not before his grandfather arrives at the funeral service. Meanwhile, Mr. Greene is humiliated after his plan is exposed, and Vera and Olympia are happy with Pablo as their new boss, while Norm and Elizabeth have three cubs together. Cast and characters * Rob Schneider as Norm. Ken Katsumoto stated that the film's writing and production team wanted Norm to be like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer; much like how Rudolph perceived his red nose as a disadvantage for him but later helped Santa a lot, Norm sees his ability to communicate with humans as a negative, but it later ultimately saves the Arctic from Mr. Greene.\\"Norm of the North Production Notes\\". Lionsgate Publicity. p. 4. Retrieved 16 September 2017. As Lionsgate's press release, Schneider was cast by the producers for the role of Norm due to his \\"vocal warmth and spot-on comedic instincts.\\" As Katsumoto explained, ‚ÄúWe immediately fell in love with Rob‚Äôs voice,‚Äù Katsumoto says. ‚ÄúHis vocal dexterity was amazing. He also did a great job of embellishing lines to make them funnier. Many of those ad libs made it into the film.‚Äù As Schneider himself described Norm, \\"I always play the guy you can laugh at and say, ‚ÄòMy life‚Äôs not that great, but look at that guy!‚Äô I think in this movie, other bears look at Norm that way. No one takes him seriously, but he follows his heart and it ends up saving their home. It‚Äôs fun to play somebody who tries to achieve something big and ends up getting rewarded because he‚Äôs not doing it for himself. That‚Äôs a nice lesson for kids.‚ÄùLionsgate Publicity. p. 4‚Äì5. * The voice actors for the lemmings are not credited in the film. As Nicolas Atlan described the lemmings, ‚ÄúWe thought it would be hysterical to combine Norm, the largest creature in the Arctic, with lemmings that are small and indestructible. They can get squashed, they can get stomped on, they can have an elevator close on them, but like Silly Putty, they bounce right back into their original shape.\\" * Ken Jeong as Mr. Greene. Jeong voiced Mr. Greene because he wanted to show his twin daughters a film that he starred in: \\"Most of the movies I do I can‚Äôt show my kids yet. With Norm of the North, they‚Äôll finally be able to watch one of Daddy‚Äôs movies. That was kind of a big incentive for me to be part of this project.‚ÄùLionsgate Publicity. p. 6. As Katsumoto explained why Jeong was chosen for the role, \\"We fell in love with the fact that Ken can be villainous and likable at the same time. He‚Äôs got incredible comic timing and spontaneity. Ken also has a lot of great subtext in his voice. Some people at advance screenings of the movie have cited Mr. Greene as their favorite character. That‚Äôs rare for a villain.‚Äù As Jeong described Mr. Green \\"Mr. Greene is a 50-year-old billionaire with a ponytail, and that‚Äôs pretty much all you need to know. He‚Äôs this misguided person who starts out with good intentions. He loves to meditate. He tries to incorporate these New Age concepts into his thinking until things go horribly awry.\\" * Heather Graham as Vera Brightly. The producers listened through numerous actress auditions for the part of Vera, looking for, in Katsumoto's words, a performance that was \\"fierce but sensitive at the same time.\\"Lionsgate Publicity. p. 5. * Maya Kay as Olympia Brightly. Kay also previously voiced for another animated film by Lionsgate named Alpha and Omega (2010). Kay said that she enjoyed voicing the character and working with Graham: \\"I was super excited to have Heather Graham play my mom ‚Äì just like Vera, she‚Äôs one of the sweetest people you‚Äôll ever meet.\\" She also explained, \\"It was really awesome to play somebody so smart, with good intentions to help Norm save his home.\\" * Colm Meaney as Grandfather * Bill Nighy as Socrates * Loretta Devine as Tamecia * Michael McElhatton (US) and James Corden (UK) as Laurence * Gabriel Iglesias as Pablo and Stan * Salome Jens as Councilwoman Klubeck * Charlie Adler as Forebear * G.K.

Critical response As of September 2020, on Rotten Tomatoes, the film had an approval rating of 9%, based on 69 reviews, with an average rating of 3/10. The site's critical consensus read, \\"A pioneering feat in the field of twerking polar bear animation but blearily retrograde in every other respect, Norm of the North should only be screened in case of parental emergency.\\" On Metacritic, as of August 2020, the film had a score of 21 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\".Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale. Critic Mark Dujsik gave the film 1 out of 4 possible stars, writing that \\"Norm of the North doesn't care about the environment, the animals of the Arctic, or even kids for that matter. It wants to be 'cute and marketable' as cheaply as possible\\". James White of Empire gave the film 1 out of 5 possible stars, writing that \\"we wouldn‚Äôt recommend you watch it even after you‚Äôve burned through every other possibility ‚Äì and that includes a blank screen\\". Mark Kermode of The Observer called the film a \\"dull ... below-par Ice Age-style tale in which the highlight is a group of vulgar lemmings\\". Michael Rechtshaffen of The Los Angeles Times called the film \\"blandly uninspired\\", and Soren Andersen of The Seattle Times called the film an \\"idiotic animated comedy\\", writing that \\"No child should be exposed to this\\". Geoff Berkshire of Variety called the film a \\"blandly executed pic\\" that \\"will quickly head south to an ancillary afterlife\\". Katie Rife of The A.V. Club gave the film a \\"D\\" grade, writing that \\"this is a movie for children. But using that as a justification for lazy work, as if kids are inherently too dumb to know the difference, isn‚Äôt just condescending. In a post-Pixar world, where audiences have become accustomed to quality animated family films, it‚Äôs a waste of money\\". Stephen Schaefer of The Boston Herald gave the film a grade of \\"B‚Äì\\", writing that, despite being \\"hardly original ... 'Norm' has oodles of charm, a razor-sharp wit, and pacing that should keep even preschoolers attentive\\". Slashfilm reported that Norm of the North temporarily had a rating of 0% on Rotten Tomatoes in January 2016, shortly after the film's release; the score was based on 35 reviews at the time, all of which were negative. Edwin L. Carpenter of The Dove Foundation gave the film its Family-Approved seal, writing that \\"your kids will enjoy Norm‚Äôs company‚Äìhe‚Äôs funny and a role model for doing the right thing.\\" Home media Norm of the North was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital HD on April 19, 2016. Sequels Prior to the official theatrical release of the film, two 45-minute direct-to-DVD sequels were announced, titled Norm of the North: Back to the City and Norm of the North: The Arctic All-Stars.

Clips from the documentary have often been used in other UFO documentaries and television episodes related to UFOs.Article at Turner Classic Movies accessed 19 May 2013 Origins and plot In 1952 Hollywood producer Clarence Greene saw an unusual object twisting in the sky. He decided to report the sighting, and contacted US Air Force public information officer Albert M. Chop, who was in charge of answering UFO questions from reporters and the public. Intrigued by his experience, Greene decided to film a documentary movie about the UFO phenomenon. When Chop told Greene about the existence of film footage of UFOs, Greene obtained the footage for analysis and display in his documentary. The documentary starts in 1947, with the first widely publicized UFO sightings in the United States, including recreations of the Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting, the Mantell UFO incident, and the Gorman Dogfight. It then traces the development of UFOs as both a popular fad and a serious concern for the US Air Force. The history of Project Sign, the first Air Force study of the UFO phenomenon, is discussed. The documentary then focuses upon Albert M. Chop and his growing involvement with UFOs. Chop is assigned as the public information officer at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, in the late 1940s. In that position he is required to answer numerous news media queries about UFO sightings and what the Air Force knows about them. Although he is initially portrayed as a UFO debunker, Chop gradually changes his views as the movie progresses, and he comes to believe that UFOs are unknown, and possibly extraterrestrial, aircraft. By 1952 Chop has moved to Washington, D.C., where he is the press spokesman for Project Blue Book. The documentary analyzes two famous pieces of UFO footage: the Mariana UFO Incident of 1950, in which the manager of the Great Falls, Montana minor-league baseball team claimed to have filmed two UFOs flying over the local baseball stadium, and the 1952 UFO film taken near the Great Salt Lake in Utah by a US Navy photographer, Delbert Newhouse. The documentary concludes with the famous 1952 Washington, D.C. UFO incident, in which Albert Chop played a central role. The documentary recreates Chop's experiences during the incident, and at the end of the documentary Chop states his belief that UFOs are a \\"real\\", physical phenomenon of unknown origin.

Sheridan (June 1, 1839 ‚Äì May 18, 1887) was an American stage actor and Civil War veteran, active on stage from 1858 until his death in 1887. Sheridan was a respected actor who played both lead and supporting roles, but was probably best suited when cast as the villain. Early life William Edward Sheridan was born in Boston, Massachusetts, where in his late teens he clerked for several years at Benjamin Loring & Co., a stationery store on State Street. He made his stage debut at Boston‚Äôs Howard Athenaeum on March 15, 1858, as Robin in Thomas Morton's five-act comedy, Town and Country. After a period with John A. Ellsler at the Cleveland Theatre (later known as the Cleveland Academy of Music), Sheridan found a niche in the fall of 1859 playing villains at Pike's Opera House, Cincinnati, remaining there until war broke out between the States. He enlisted in the spring of 1861 at Cincinnati with the Sixth Ohio Infantry and rose to the rank of captain before a sniper‚Äôs bullet fractured a forearm during the Battle of Resaca, Georgia. Though a skilled army surgeon ultimately saved his arm, the wound would plague him for the rest of life.William E. Sheridan Dead. The New York Times, June 12, 1887, p. 2Actor Sheridan's Death.

When Edwin Forrest began his engagement at Niblo's that September, Sheridan would fill in as his substitute on the actor‚Äôs off days. Sheridan later returned as a lead actor to Pike's Opera House until the theatre was consumed by fire in March 1866. Over the following several seasons Sheridan was associated with theatres in St. Louis, Washington D. C., Boston, New Orleans and Philadelphia.

By this time Sheridan‚Äôs health had been in decline for some time. His condition, even before his departure for Australia, would at times leave him too frail to take to the stage. The end came in the early morning hours of May 18, 1887, in Sydney, just a few hours after suffering a stroke as he sat in the audience of a local theatre.

It is located in the Sunnyside neighborhood in Fresno County, at Fresno, California, a historic community southeast of the city limits of Fresno. Designed by golf course architect William P. Bell and opening in 1911, it is the oldest golf course in Fresno and one of the oldest in California. In addition to the golf course, Sunnsyside Country Club has a swimming pool, tennis courts, exercise facilities and a restaurant and bar for its members.  History  Sunnyside County Club traces its origins back to one of the early vineyards of Fresno County. In 1890, the land on which the club currently sits was purchased by William N. Oothout from Frederick Roeding, creating the Sunnyside Vineyard. By 1911, a group of wealthy and well-known Fresnans, including George C. Roeding, C.C. Teague and Frank Romain, bought a portion of the old Sunnyside Vineyard and Oothout‚Äôs colonial home to build a golf course for the club. The men hired Bell to design the golf course, which was completed in 1911. Oothout's colonial home was used at the clubhouse, until it was destroyed by fire in 1941. The existing clubhouse is built in the mid-century modern style an contains a large fireplace sculpture by Fresno artist Stan Bitters. The clubhouse was built in 1948 and was designed by H. Rafael Lake. The Fresno Open on the LPGA Tour was held at Sunnyside in 1951 and 1952, with Babe Zaharias winning both tournaments. Sunnyside currently hosts numerous NCAA and amateur tournaments. Throughout its history, many well-known Fresnans have lived on the course itself, including Fresno State Bulldogs Football Coach Jim Sweeney (hole 7) and World War II Flying Ace Pappy Boyington (hole 14).

Life and career  Giuseppe Raggio, Cappata di cavalli nella campagna romana, 1892, Genova, GAM He was born in Chiavari, and while his father wished him to join the merchant marine, by 1845 he had decided to study painting, and participated in his first exhibition in Genoa. He enrolled in the Accademia di Belle Arti of Florence, where he studied under the neoclassical painter Giuseppe Bezzuoli. By 1846, he became friends with Giovanni Fattori and painters of the Macchiaioli movement who frequented the Caff√® Michelangiolo. In 1848, amid the revolutionary turmoil, Raggio moved to Rome. In Rome, he met the painter of agrarian subjects, Nino Costa.Biography, prepared for May 13‚Äì29, 2010 exhibition in Rome, curated by Giancarlo Belardi. While he continued to paint some religious subjects such as a Holy Family (1854, Genoa) and a Samaritan (1862), Raggio by 1860 favored scenes of cattle farming in the Lazio countryside sa subject matter for his paintings. His Bufali (1860) at the Palazzo Pitti in Florence marks this change. In 1865 at Dublin, he exhibited Campagna Romana. He painted in oil and watercolor. In 1880 in Turin, he exhibited Bovi che vanno all' aratro; at the 1881 Exhibition of Milan, tratto della Campagna romana; in 1883 in Rome, La malaria and Jolillius; and at the 1884 National Exhibition of Turin, Pellegrinaggio di ciociare at Rome alla visita di San Pietro. Other paintings include: Bufalo alla palude; Mandria di bovi; All'abbeveratoio; Paesaggio romano; Scena campestre e Solitudine; Un duello interrotto: Costume romano; Cavallari romani; and La pastura nelle campagne romane.

For a 1913 exhibition, the painter and art critic Sartorio spoke of Raggio as a > man of simple nature, a believer, who does not know what the world owes to > the value of his genius... bypassed and excluded between two generations of > painters... (he is an) Artist not to budging an inch from the convictions > which he had set himself, and his paintings, from a young age to today, have > only one character, a single focus: to tell the story of the humble > inhabitants of the Roman Campagna in communion with the herds of sheep and > cows.

The population while poor and stray, maintains the innate > goodness, spirituality, generous and fantastic, and fair in his humility, > this has pleased the Ligurian painter. ...le parole di Sartorio > nell‚Äôintroduzione al catalogo che presentava Raggio e le sue opere: Giuseppe > Raggio, uomo dalla natura semplice, credente, non seppe mai quello che il > mondo deve al valore del suo ingegno; chiese, non pretese, e pass√≤ umile, > sospinto ed escluso fra due generazioni di pittori che urgevano.

In 1915, he was knighted in the Order of the Crown of Italy. Due to his advanced state of poverty, a commission from the Societ√† Economica di Chiavari, composed of Pietro Gaudenzi, Giuseppe Canevelli, and Luigi Brizzolara, approached him to buy some of his works at a reasonable price. He died by October of the next year.Biography References Category:1823 births Category:1916 deaths Category:19th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:20th-century Italian painters Category:Artists from Rome Category:People from Lazio Category:Italian painters of animals Category:Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze alumni ","title":"Giuseppe Raggio"},{"id":"39424676","text":"Le Pays is a newspaper in Burkina Faso.

Vella, ‚ÄòThe origins and development of the Royal University of Malta‚Äô, Foundation Day Ceremony, 12 November 1965, University Press, Malta 1966, 12), and the name Joseph Angelo (http://www.um.edu.mt/about/uom/history/rectors). was a Dominican theologian, the first Professor of Philosophy at the University of Malta and Rector of the same university.Mark Montebello, Il-Ktieb tal- Filosofija f‚ÄôMalta (A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. II, p. 45. Life Moncada was born in Modica, Italy, and joined the Dominican Order. He was regent of studies at the Dominican college in Sicily. In Malta, he was close to the Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller, who engaged him in various offices. Around 1750, Moncada was Professor of Theology at the Dominican college of Portus Salutis in Valletta, where he taught logic, metaphysics, and ethics. He taught the same subjects at the University of Malta.Malta National Library, Ms. 1343, fol. 3v. Here he had been teaching since 1768. Some time before, he might have been part of the Accademia dei Geniali of Modica,http://www.centrostudialeph.it/progetti/convivio/pdf/perlongo_ignazio/criscione.pdf and also, in 1751, a coadjutor of the Confraternita di Santa Maria della Candelora of Sicily http://www.carnesecchi.eu/Sicilia.htm It appears that in 1770 Moncada had left Malta, since in November of that year Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca wrote to the Master General of the Dominicans in Rome to request that Moncada be sent to Malta immediately to help him in the establishment of the University of Malta.Archivium Generalis Ordinis Praedicatorum, Rome, Vol. IV, fol. 39 (12 November 1770). Moncada returned to Malta in 1771,A.

Laurenza, ‚ÄòIl primo Rettore e i primi statuti dell‚ÄôUniversit√† di Malta‚Äô, Malta 1934, 18. an office Moncada kept until 1773. In 1778, Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc made some reforms at the University of Malta which in effect amounted to a refoundation. Consequently, he chose and appointed Moncada as Rector.A. Vella, ‚ÄòThe University of S. Maria Portus Salutis‚Äô, Journal of the Faculty of Arts, Vol. II, No. 2, 1962, 179. Notwithstanding, Moncada‚Äôs appointment did not come into effect until 1780.V. Laurenza, op. cit., 145. Moncada, however, acted as Rector immediately since the official Rector was confined to bed with gout.A. Vella, ‚ÄòThe origins‚Äô, op. cit., 12. During his time of tenure as rector, Moncada also held the Chair of Philosophy, first as the deputy of Dominic Malarbi (from October to December 1779), and then as Professor. Moncada remained Rector of the university and Professor of Philosophy up till 1786. While holding these offices, he continued with the reforms which had begun before him. Through his efforts, the University of Malta became an autonomous academic institution (1778), it acquired the power to administer its own property, and also to have a treasury independent from that of government.‚ÄòEnte autonomo, amministrante i proprii fondi, in assoluta indipendenza dal Comun Tesoro‚Äô‚Äì Malta National Library, Archive of the Hospitaller Order, Ms. 273, fol. 21‚Äì22; V.

PE Linde appeared for the appellant and BG van der Walt, SC, Attorney-General OFS, for the State. The case was heard on March 8, 1963. The appellant's attorney was DA Carroll, Johannesburg.  Facts  In an appeal from a conviction of culpable homicide on a charge of murder, it appeared that the trial judge had repeatedly directed the jury that they could not acquit the appellant, on his plea of self-defence, unless they came to the conclusion that a reasonable man in his situation would have feared that his life was in danger.  Judgment  The court held that the trial judge should have directed the jury that the appellant would have been justified in shooting the deceased if he justifiably feared that he was about to suffer grievous bodily harm at his hands. The failure so to direct the jury was an irregularity which had prejudiced the appellant, because it appeared that the jury might have found that, even though he did not fear for his life, he most certainly feared very serious bodily harm when he was assaulted by the deceased. The appeal was accordingly allowed and the conviction and sentence set aside.

The park, home to mountains, waterfalls and caves, is part of the Western Forest Complex protected area. Geography Sai Yok National Park is in the Tenasserim Hills mountain chain, northwest of Kanchanaburi town. The park's area is . The Khwae Noi river (\\"River Kwai\\") runs through the park. The park's highest peak is Khao Khwae at . The western boundary of the park adjoins Myanmar. Climate Temperatures in the park area have a wide annual range from to . The driest time of the year here is from December to February, while the rainiest time is from May to October. History Within the park are remains of a bridge on the Burma Railway and of a camp used by Japanese troops during World War II. In 1978, the Russian roulette scenes of the film The Deer Hunter were filmed in the park. On 27 October 1980, Sai Yok became Thailand's 11th national park. Attractions Sai Yok Yai Lek waterfall The park's major attractions are its waterfalls, including Sai Yok Yai waterfall which flows into the Khwae Noi river. Sai Yok Yai Lek waterfall lies south of Sai Yok Yai along the Khwae Noi. The park also contains numerous caves, the largest of which is Tham Lawa with a length of . This cave complex consists of five large caverns, each containing large stalactites and stalagmites. Another cave system, Tham Daowadueng, is long and was discovered in 1972. Tham Daowadung consists of eight chambers of stalactites and stalagmites. Flora and fauna Sai Yok's forest is primarily teak forest. During the Japanese occupation of Thailand, teak trees were felled for use as railway sleepers on the Burma Railway. The teak forest was replanted in 1954. Animal species include elephants, tiger, barking deer, sambar deer, wild pig, gibbon, Malayan porcupine, slow loris and serow. A species of crab--the Rachinee crab, coloured red, white and blue--was discovered in the park in 1983. Sai Yok is home to Kitti's hog-nosed bat, a rare bat species considered to be the world's smallest mammal (weighing around 2 grams). The bat was first spotted in 1973 and is found only in some limestone caves of the park (including Tham Kang Kao) and surrounding areas in Kanchanaburi Province and nearby Myanmar.

The appellant's attorneys were Renaud & Mooney, Durban, and Kannemeyer & Jeffreys, Bloemfontein.  Facts  The accused and one Edna Saunders, at the latter's suggestion, decided to commit suicide by introducing into a closed motor car poisonous fumes from the exhaust pipe of the car. The accused made the necessary arrangements. He and Saunders then sat in the car, and the accused started the engine. They both lost consciousness but were later removed from the car and eventually recovered. The accused was convicted of attempted murder. The case came to the Appellate Division as an appeal upon a question of law reserved by Carlisle J, presiding with assessors at the Criminal Sessions of the Durban and Coast Local Division.  Arguments  TB Turner, for the appellant, argued that neither suicide nor attempt to commit suicide is a crime in South Africa.Gardiner and Lansdown on SA Criminal Law (4th ed., vol. 1, p. 88; vol. 2, p. 1263).Van Leeuwen's Roman-Dutch Law (Kotze's trans, 2nd ed., vol. 2, p. 275 and footnote on p. 276 and p. 277). If accused was merely an accessory to attempted suicide, he committed no crime.See Rex v Rasool 1924 AD 44 at p. 47. There was no intent to kill; therefore accused did not attempt murder. LC Barrett, for the Crown, contended that a person cannot in law consent to his life being taken by the other party to a suicide pact. If the other kills him in the execution of such pact, such killing is unlawful.See Gardiner and Lansdown on SA Criminal Law (4th ed., vol. 1, p. 85).Grotius (2.1.43, 44, 46).Schorer's Note 70 on sec. 44.Van Leeuwen's Roman-Dutch Law (4.34.11, p. 277 of vol. 2, Kotze's trans.).Moorman (van Hasselt) Over de Misdaaden (2.11.4). The question whether suicide is or is not a crime was irrelevant, he contended; alternatively, he argued that suicide was not a crime in South African law.See Gardiner and Lansdown on SA Criminal Law (4th ed., vol. 2, p. 1263).Van Leeuwen's Roman-Dutch Law (Kotze's trans, 2nd ed., vol. 2, p. 275).Van der Linden's Institutes (2.5.14).  Judgment  The appeal was dismissed. The court held that the fact that Saunders was free to breathe the poisonous gas or not as she pleased did not free the accused from criminal responsibility for his acts. The accused had contemplated and expected that, as a consequence of his acts, Saunders would die; he therefore intended to kill her, however little he may have desired her death. Watermeyer JA observed that Van der Linden's statement in his notes to Voet seems to differ from his statement in the Institutes.See Carpzovius' Lijfstraffelyke Misdaaden (ch. 2, paras. 13-21).See the article on suicide in the SA Law Journal (vol. 25, p. 413). As regards a person who attempted to commit suicide, it was doubtful whether he thereby committed a crime in South African law.See Moorman (2.11.2 and 4) (not punishable).See Damhouder Cap. LXXXI (in affirmative).See Carpzovius (supra) (eh. 2, para. 22 et seq.) (punishable under certain circumstances). The evidence showed that the accused had the intention to kill. He actually set about encompassing the death of Saunders; his acts went beyond mere preparation.As to what constitutes an attempt see Rex v Sharpe 1903 TS 868; Rex v Nlhovo 1921 AD 485; Rex v Vilinsky and Lipschitz 1932 OPD 218. In English law, attempted suicide was a misdemeanour according to Rex v Doody,6 Cox 463. but according to Rex v Mann,1914, 2 KB 107. it was a felony.See also Russell on Crimes (8th ed., vol. 1, pp. 618, 620). A change of mind after his acts had amounted to an attempt could not avail him.See Rex v Hlatwayo and Another 1933 TPD 441.

He dominated theatrical activity in Paris between 1606 and 1612.Roy 1995 spells his name \\"Valleran le Conte\\" and states he is one of the earliest known actor-managers; Hartnoll 1983, pp. 856‚Äì857, spells his name \\"Valleran- Lecomte\\"; Forman has both spellings of his name. 'Flourished' dates are from Hartnoll. Forman 2010, p. 245, states Valleran Le Comte dominated in Paris between 1606 to 1612 and was again active in Paris in 1615. From 1592 to 1593 he was a strolling player in the provinces.Roy 1995. In 1592 he was performing in Bordeaux, and in 1593 in Frankfurt, where he requested permission to present Biblical tragedies that he claimed to have already given in Rouen and Strasbourg, along with plays by √âtienne Jodelle. Not long afterwards he was leading his own company, paying Alexandre Hardy to write plays, and employing Marie Venier as his leading actress.Hartnoll 1983, pp. 856‚Äì857. In 1599, in association with an actor named Adrien Talmy, he signed a three-month lease for the H√¥tel de Bourgogne in Paris and formed a company named the Com√©diens du Roi.Forman 2010, p. 245; Roy 1995 (3-month lease). According to G√©d√©on Tallemant des R√©aux in his Historiettes, when Valleran le Conte first played in Paris, he collected the admission fee at the entrance to the theatre himself. Money problems only permitted him to perform intermittently in Paris, and on several occasions he was forced to tour in the provinces and the Low Countries, sometimes reconstituting his troupe or merging it with another.Roy 1995; Hartnoll 1983, pp. 856‚Äì857 (Tallemant des R√©aux; Low Countries). The older actor Agnan Sarat, who in 1578 had brought his own company to Paris and leased the H√¥tel de Bourgogne, became the chief comedian in Valleran le Conte's company in 1600 and remained with him until Sarat's death in 1613.Hartnoll 1983, p. 731 ( \\"Sarat, Agnan\\"). Valleran le Conte himself was well received as an actor, performing the young lover in Commedia dell'Arte plays and also in farce. He is noted for giving the plays of Hardy and worked with other well-known actors, including Bellerose, Bruscambille, Gaultier- Garguille, Gros-Guillaume, and Montdory. His interactions with Italian troupes in Paris influenced the subsequent Italianate style of French acting in the early 17th century.Forman 2010, p. 245. In 1612 he left Paris, forming yet another company to tour the provinces, but recently discovered documents show he was back in Paris again in 1615. References Notes Sources * Banham, Martin (1995).

Although Vishwa is a graduate, he has also learned the skill of sculpting from Swami. Vishwa meets Kavitha (Sija Rose), and both of them like each other. Meanwhile, there is a village where many sculptors come to finish a god's idol that is left incomplete a few years back, but all efforts go in vain as the sculptors are frightened and sent away by a ghost which prevents the completion of the idol. Sarath Babu is the village head, and Rajeshwari (Roja) is his wife. Rajeshwari has enmity with her relative Devanna Gounder (Aadukalam Naren), who happens to be Kavitha's father. As per the advice from an astrologer, Devanna meets Swami, requesting him to visit his village and complete the god's idol. However, Swami insists Vishwa to do the job on his behalf. Swami tells a flashback to Vishwa. Vetri (Ramki) is the only brother of the village head who falls in love with Masani (Iniya), a lower caste girl from the same village. Masani gets pregnant, and Vetri decides to marry her against Rajeshwari's wishes. However, Vetri stands firm in his decision, while Rajeshwari poisons and kills Vetri. She also insults Masani for getting pregnant before wedding and isolates her out of the village, asking no one to help her. Masani undergoes many hardships as she is left alone. Swami comes to the village to make the god's idol and sees Masani in labor pain. Despite his attempts, no one comes forward to help her. Masani delivers a baby boy, informs about her life to Swami, and passes away. Swami gets furious on the village people and leaves the village without completing the idol, believing that the entire village will one day realize their mistake. Swami adopts the baby, and he is none other than Vishwa. Vishwa comes to the village and successfully completes the idol. Masani's soul thrashes Rajeshwari which makes her confess all the truth to villagers. Rajeshwari then gets killed by Masani's soul. Swami arrives and informs that Vishwa is none other than the son of Vetri and Masani. The entire village realizes their mistake and apologizes to Vishwa. Finally, Vishwa is married to Kavitha.
