He started his career on the , but he later shifted to the forwards playing mostly in the . Playing career A Brisbane junior, Protheroe started his rugby league career in 1990 playing for QRL side Redcliffe Dolphins in the Brisbane competition. In 1991, Protheroe along with Redcliffe coach Mark Murray were signed by the Eastern Suburbs Roosters. Protheroe made his first grade debut in his sides' 16-10 loss to arch rivals the South Sydney Rabbitohs at the Sydney Football Stadium in the opening round of the 1991 season. Despite a poor season from the Roosters in which they finished in 11th position, Protheroe had a brilliant rookie season, he played in 20 of his sides' 22 games and scored 7 tries. Protheroe narrowly missed out on winning the Dally M award for Rookie of the Year. Instead Will Robinson of the Balmain Tigers won the award. More success followed Protheroe in the 1992 season, despite the Roosters narrowly missing out on finals qualification for the first time since 1987, finishing in 6th position, Protheroe starred, playing in all 22 games and scoring 6 tries. For his efforts, Protheroe was considered for the Queensland side in the 1992 State of Origin series, however Protheroe ultimately missed out on selection when Adrian Brunker and Michael Hancock were instead chosen as the wingers. Protheroe played his first match in the forwards when he was chosen at second-row in round 17 of the 1993 season, he would play most of his later career in this position. After disappointing seasons in 1993, 1994, and 1995 in which the Roosters finished 8th, 14th, and 9th respectively, Protheroe decided to leave the Roosters at the end of the 1995 season and returned to Brisbane. In 1996, after five seasons in Sydney with the Roosters, Protheroe returned to Brisbane, this time to play for the South Queensland Crushers. He along with fellow Roosters Nigel Gaffey, Jason Hudson, Graham Mackay and Clinton O'Brien joined the ill-fated Crushers. Despite having a relatively strong playing roster which included these players as well as former Origin players Terry Cook, Trevor Gillmeister and Tony Hearn, the Crushers finished with the wooden spoon in both the 1996 and 1997 seasons. With the demise of the Crushers at the end of the 1997 season, Protheroe decided to retire from playing. He finished his career having played 123 games and scoring 33 tries.

She was known chiefly for still lifes, landscapes and portraiture.  Life  Margarethe Diederike von Reinken was born in Bremen, the youngest of her parents' eight children. Her father, Daniel von Reinken (1831‚Äì1894), came from a leading family of Bremen merchants. While her father's business was still flourishing she was enrolled at the newly established so-called \\"Lady Artists' Academy\\" (\\"Malerinnenschule\\") in Karlsruhe, where she was taught by Friedrich Fehr and Ludwig Schmid-Reutte. She returned home to Bremen to launch herself as a freelance artist, setting up a studio at her widowed mother's house in the Feldstra√üe (loosely \\"Field Street\\"). She hoped to establish herself through contract work, focusing on portraits. Despite the acknowledged excellence of her draftsmanship and her good social contacts, she struggled financially at a time when the economy was undergoing a lengthy period of major structural dislocation. Around 1900 she also came into contact with the nearby Worpswede Artists' Colony. Her work was influenced members of it including Fritz Overbeck and Heinrich Vogeler. Several of her oil painted landscapes of nature and the countryside round Worpswede date from these early years of the twentieth century. After the war her economic situation became more dire and she was no longer able to fall back on the family wealth, which was largely destroyed by the hyper-inflation of the period. With her elder sisters having married and set up their own homes, she was also, as the spinster daughter, expected to take care of her mother. Meanwhile, she remained in close contact with other local artists such as August Tolkien and Toni Elster with whom, in 1924, she staged a \\"collective\\" exhibition at the Bremen Kunsthalle art museum. Von Reinken was now also supplementing her income by teaching. Two of her pupils who later established significant artistic careers of their own were Agnes Sander-Plump and Gustava Th√∂lken. During the later 1920s she visited her elder sister Daniele, who had emigrated from Bremen to Brazil. In 1926 she painted several views of Rio and various mountain landscape sketches which are now in the possession of the family in S√£o Paulo. Back in Bremen, in 1930 she was one of the very few women whose works were included at that year's GEDOK exhibition. Meanwhile she accepted the offer of friend to work for their family as a housekeeper. She kept the job for 17 years. She was able to use a room in the family home which she could use as a studio, but time available for painting was limited. She was nevertheless able to create a significant number of paintings for sale and exhibitions, her work included in a number of subsequent GEDOK exhibitions in Bremen, as a result of which her work remains represented in collections and galleries in and around Bremen. In 1947 moved to a house owned by the Meta von Post Foundation in Bremen-Horn where she lived out her final fifteen years. A substantial retrospective exhibition of her work took place at the Bremen Kunsthalle art museum during the second quarter of 1994, featuring her paintings, water-colours and drawings. G√ºnter Busch, director of the museum, paid tribute to her \\"perfect pitch\\" (\\"absolutes Geh√∂r\\") in terms of colour and commended her \\"artistic sense of responsibility ... in respect of her critical self-appraisal\\". He added, \\"she did not allow her paintings to become superficial or frivolous. She tried to exclude from her art anything approximate or imprecise\\".

It catered to the Jewish residents of the Lower East Side, who were the overwhelmingly predominant local population at the time, although expectant mothers of any religion were accepted. In its first 20 years of operation, 31,295 babies were born at Jewish Maternity Hospital. The hospital merged administratively with Beth Israel Hospital on December 19, 1929. Beth Israel was in financial straits because of cost overruns on a new building under construction at Stuyvesant Square, and Jewish Maternity Hospital had money available for their own construction plans. When Beth Israel finished their construction in 1931, Jewish Maternity Hospital also moved to the site.

European 112 Day is an international day that is annually held on February 11. It was introduced by the European Union and aims to promote the existence and appropriate use of the Europe-wide emergency number 112.  The Europe-wide emergency call  In addition to the national emergency telephone numbers, the Europe-wide emergency telephone number 112 was introduced in 1991 in order to make a common emergency call available in every member state of the European Union. Since December 2008, the emergency call services can be reached from all fixed and mobile networks and free of charges with the common telephone number 112. Due to the rising publicity of 112 as the European emergency number, it is turning into a common symbol of help and support, but also of the European Union in general.  Origins  The European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission signed a tripartite convention in 2009 in order to introduce an annual European 112-day. It is supposed to raise awareness for the Europe-wide availability and the advantages of the European emergency call 112.

This order applied particularly to the New York City Subway, which was the most severely affected by dilapidated infrastructure, causing overcrowding and delays. With many parts of the system approaching or exceeding 100 years of age, general deterioration could be seen in many subway stations. By 2017, only 65% of weekday trains reached their destinations on time, the lowest rate since a transit crisis in the 1970s. To a lesser extent, New York City buses operated by the MTA were also affected. Both the subway and the buses are run by the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), a subsidiary of the MTA. A separate crisis at Penn Station affected the routes of the three railroad agencies that provided service into the station. Media outlets deemed these crises \\"the summer of hell\\". There were myriad causes attributed to the transit crisis. The subway was affected by a lack of funds, signal slowdowns, and broken-down infrastructure. The buses were also affected by a lack of funds, but individual routes had additional problems including low frequencies, slow speeds, and winding routes. Money from the MTA in general was withheld due to actions from politicians at both the city and state levels, from both the Democratic Party and Republican Party. These issues caused delays for passengers for both systems, ranging from moderate to severe, as well as resulted in thousands of hours of lost time for passengers. Additionally, ridership on the subway started declining for the first time in several years, and ridership on buses continued a gradual decline that had started before the crisis. Several solutions were proposed. In July 2017, MTA chairman Joe Lhota created a multifaceted \\"Subway Action Plan\\" that consisted of a short-term solution to improve reliability and increase capacity, as well as long-term solutions that implemented improvement ideas from a public \\"Genius Challenge\\". A corresponding \\"Bus Action Plan\\" was released in April 2018. Later that year, the Regional Plan Association released a report that advocated for large investments to the subway system. Governor Cuomo also proposed implementing congestion pricing in New York City in order to fund the MTA. In 2018, the MTA hired Andy Byford from the Toronto Transit Commission as the new NYCTA chief in an attempt to solve the transit crisis. Byford presented a report titled \\"Fast Forward: The Plan to Modernize New York City Transit\\" to tackle the issues plaguing the transit system. Service improved through 2019, but the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City in early 2020 further depleted the MTA's finances.  Declaration of crisis  On June 27, 2017, thirty-nine people were injured when an A train derailed at 125th Street because the emergency brakes were activated after the train hit an improperly secured piece of replacement rail. The next day, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order declaring a state of emergency for the subway system. This state of emergency had also arisen after several track fires and overcrowding incidents. As part of the order, he ordered MTA Chairman Joe Lhota to come up with a reorganization plan within 30 days. A day later, the MTA officially announced the Genius Transit Challenge, where contestants could submit ideas to improve signals, communications infrastructure, or rolling stock. The winner of each of the three challenges was to receive a million dollars and have their idea implemented systemwide. At Pennsylvania Station in Midtown Manhattan, a separate transit crisis developed because Amtrak had postponed the maintenance of infrastructure around the station, which was the nation's busiest. In early 2017, this culminated in numerous power outages, derailments, and delays due to track maintenance. There were frequent service disruptions to Long Island Rail Road and NJ Transit train schedules caused by the deterioration of its tracks and their supporting infrastructure, as well as in those of the East River and North River Tunnels that respectively connect the station to Long Island and New Jersey. During July 2017, Governor Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio disputed who has control of the subway system. Cuomo claimed that since the subway system was owned by New York City and leased to the MTA, the city had to pay more for its capital needs. However, de Blasio argued that his large $2.5 billion contribution was enough. On July 21, the second set of wheels on a southbound Q train jumped the track near Brighton Beach, constituting the system's second derailment within a month. Nine people suffered injuries due to improper maintenance of the car in question.  Causes  = Lack of funds = On November 18, 2017, The New York Times published its investigation into the crisis, with over 1,000 readers having submitted stories about the effects of the past year's subway delays. It found that politicians from both the Democratic and Republican parties, at the mayoral and gubernatorial levels, had gradually removed $1.5 billion of MTA funding. The Times stressed that no single event directly caused the crisis; rather, it was an accumulation of small cutbacks and maintenance deferments. The New York Times described MTA funds as a \\"piggy bank\\" for the state, with the issuance of MTA bonds benefiting the state at the MTA's expense. By 2017, a sixth of the MTA's budget was allocated to paying off debt, a threefold increase from the proportion in 1997. The city's $250 million annual contribution to the MTA budget in 2017 was a quarter of the contribution in 1990. The MTA's East Side Access, became the most expensive underground railway project in the world due to politicians' monetary mismanagement of the MTA, as well costly, inefficient union rules. This lack of funds was not only due to the gradual reduction of funding. Other actions by city and state politicians, according to the Times, included overspending; overpaying unions and interest groups; advertising superficial improvement projects while ignoring more important infrastructure; and agreeing to high-interest loans that would have been unnecessary without these politicians' other interventions. In December of the same year, the Times reported that the $12 billion East Side Access project, which would extend the MTA's Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal upon its completion, was the most expensive of its kind in the world, with a projected price of $3.5 billion per mile ( billion per kilometer) of track. Over the years, the projected cost of East Side Access had risen by billions of dollars due to unnecessary expenses. In addition to overpaying workers and overspending, politicians and trade unions had forced the MTA to hire more workers than was needed. In 2010, an accountant found that the project was hiring 200 extra workers, at a cost of $1,000 per worker per day, for no apparent reason. The bidding process for MTA construction contracts also raised costs because, in some cases, only one or two contractors would bid on a project. Similar construction projects in New York City, such as the Second Avenue Subway and 7 Subway Extension, had been more expensive than comparable projects elsewhere for the same reasons, even though other cities' transit systems faced similar, or greater, problems compared to the MTA. = Signal and work-zone slowdowns = The transit crisis was influenced partly by modifications to New York City Subway signals and work-zone policies that forced trains to reduce their average speeds. After a collision between two trains on the Williamsburg Bridge in 1995, in which a train operator was killed after speeding his train into the back of another, the MTA modified both signals and trains to lower their average speeds. Trains' maximum speeds were physically limited, while some signals were modified to prevent trains from proceeding through a certain signal block before a minimum time had elapsed. These signals, referred to as \\"time signals\\", forced operators to slow train speeds so that they would only pass through the signal block after the timer elapsed. Some of these time signals malfunctioned: they prevented trains from passing even if the operator had slowed down the train to the speed that was indicated, and so some operators slowed trains further in case a time signal forced trains to wait for longer than was indicated. This resulted in overcrowded trains, since fewer trains per hour were able to proceed on certain sections of track. By 2012, over 1,200 signals had been modified, and by 2018, that number had grown to 1,800. Exacerbating the signal problems, some of the oldest block signals in the system were 80 years old , and they also broke down frequently. Subway trains were also forced to slow down due to work-zone rules. These rules were created by a task force, which was implemented in 2007 after a series of worker deaths. Prior to 2007, even if one track was out of service, trains on adjacent tracks could operate at normal speeds. Under the new rules, if a track was directly adjacent to a track in a work-zone, trains on the adjacent track also had to slow down to 10 miles per hour or less. As a result, the proportion of delays caused by track work increased by 10% between 2013 and 2014, even though there were roughly the same number of track work in both years. = Bus problems = A corresponding bus crisis was not covered as heavily in the media. However, in November 2017, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer identified several causes for the bus system's unreliability. In the report, he wrote that almost half of all bus routes ran low frequencies in one or both directions of travel during rush hours. He also said that many bus routes were vulnerable to \\"bus bunching\\", where several buses travel the same route in quick succession. The average speeds of New York City buses were found to be , the slowest of any major bus system nationwide. Additionally, Stringer wrote that long, winding bus routes caused bus speeds to slow down.  Effects  2 train, the least reliable route in the subway system as of 2017 Even before the crisis, every non-shuttle subway route's on-time performance had declined: in 2007, all of these routes had over 70% on-time performance, arriving at the last station within five minutes of the timetable, but in 2017, only three routes could claim that distinction. The least reliable route, the 2 train, reached its terminus on-schedule only 32% of the time. The subway's 65% average on-time performance was the lowest among all major cities' transit systems, ranking behind the Hong Kong MTR (100%), Seoul Metropolitan Subway (99%), San Francisco's BART (86%), and Mexico City Metro (71%). David L. Gunn, who helped end the 1980s transit crisis when he led the NYCTA in the mid-1980s, described the 2017 crisis as \\"heartbreaking\\". In August 2017, The New York Times released an article about how the routes that serve the Lexington Avenue Line (the ) failed to meet its schedule count during weekday rush hours when demand is at its highest. A study conducted on weekdays between June 9 and July 31 by the MTA revealed about 14% of the trains that were scheduled to pass through the Grand Central‚Äì42nd Street station during rush hours never came. During the time this study was conducted, the closest the line ever came to meeting its printed schedule was 88 out of 90 trains during the a.m. rush hour, and 83 out of 88 trains during the p.m. rush hour. Officials have often blamed overcrowding for the reasons why trains are canceled, and Chairman Lhota has stated that maintaining space between trains was more of a priority for him than meeting the schedules was. However, overcrowding was really an effect, rather than a cause, of delays. Although average weekday ridership stayed largely constant from 2012 to 2018, the number of delays attributed to overcrowding increased, even as the number of other types of delays did not change by much. In October 2017, Comptroller Stringer released an analysis of the effect of subway delays on the economy and on commuters. The study found that based on a normal wait time of 5 minutes and an average wage of $34 per hour in 2016, \\"worst-case\\" subway delays of more than 20 minutes could cost up to $389 million annually in lost productivity. By comparison, \\"mid-case\\" delays of between 10 and 20 minutes could cost $243.1 million per year, and \\"best-case\\" delays of between 5 and 10 minutes could cost $170.2 million per year. Passengers on the 5 train suffered the greatest wage loss from worst-case delays, while passengers on the 7 train lost the most wages from medium- and best-case delays. As a result of the maintenance crisis, weekday subway ridership started declining for the first time in several years. Despite a 1.1% increase in the number of jobs in the city between September 2016 and September 2017, weekday ridership declined 1.4% and weekend ridership declined 1.0%. With 5.712 million average weekday riders in September 2017, this translated to about 105,000 fewer riders per weekday. Even during the previous year, when the subway as a whole saw a 0.3% decrease in annual ridership‚Äîmarking the first such decrease since 2009‚Äîweekday ridership had risen by about 0.1%. Bus ridership also maintained a continuing decrease. One hundred million fewer riders rode MTA buses in 2017 than in 2008. Rider complaints on social media intensified during the crisis: by mid-2018, there were 2,500 daily complaints to the MTA's and subway's Twitter accounts. By January 2018, average weekday on-time performance had dropped from 65% to 58.1%, and there were more than 76,000 delayed trains. The delayed trains were defined as those that had reached their terminus at least five minutes later than what was listed on the timetable. Of these, over 10,000 trains, or 14%, had been delayed for unknown causes. Exacerbating the situation, the MTA incorrectly classified the causes of the unknown delays under one of the fourteen known categories of delays, classifying equal amounts of \\"unknown delays\\" under each category. It was so common for subway trains to be delayed that many commuters rearranged their schedules around the subway, traveling earlier than usual to factor in any potential subway delays.  Short-term solutions  After a particularly bad round of delays in May 2017, the MTA devised a \\"six-point plan\\" to reduce subway delays. It planned to hasten the delivery of new R211 cars; perform testing on boarding and alighting patterns at stations; post emergency medical technicians at key stations to treat sick passengers; double the frequency of the monthly track- defect detection tests; reduce bottlenecks at junctions; and reorganize the leadership hierarchy. The plan would cost $20 million and be implemented at 21 stations as a trial: nineteen stations on the heavily used IND Eighth Avenue Line between 125th Street and Fulton Street, as well as the 149th Street‚ÄìGrand Concourse and Third Avenue‚Äì138th Street stations in the Bronx. These locations were chosen since they were the source of frequent bottlenecks. On the Eighth Avenue Line especially, there are an average of 25 subway-car breakdowns per month, with the average such delay lasting 19 minutes. The EMTs would be posted in five Eighth Avenue Line stations: 125th Street, 59th Street, 14th Street, West Fourth Street, and Fulton Street. There would also be an increased police presence. The improved boarding and alighting patterns might include color-coded platforms and subway cars, as well as additional signage. Finally, there would be a new chairman position to be split off of the existing CEO position. Transit commentators viewed the plan positively, regarding the plan as a small step toward increasing the subway's reliability. Also in May, Amtrak announced that it would perform some track maintenance around Penn Station over a period of one and a half months in summer 2017. Five tracks were closed for repairs as part of the reconstruction work, severely reducing track capacity in a situation media outlets deemed \\"the summer of hell\\". Many affected NJ Transit passengers were diverted to take the PATH instead. Regular service resumed on September 5, 2017. alt=the interior of a 42nd Street Shuttle train without any seats On July 25, Chairman Lhota announced a two-phase, $9 billion New York City Subway Action Plan to stabilize the subway system and to prevent the continuing decline of the system. *See also: It expanded on the six-point plan elaborated on in May. The $836 million first phase, to be effective immediately, focused on \\"stabilization\\". It consisted of five categories. The first, Signal and Track Maintenance, included creating new crews to repair infrastructure more efficiently, adding continuously welded rail to more tracks, repairing 1,300 broken signals, cleaning 40,000 storm grates, and hiring 2,700 workers to repair broken signals and tracks more quickly. The second, Car Reliability, would put emphasis on maintaining car doors in a more timely fashion, add cars to trains on the C route, remove seats from 42nd Street Shuttle and L train cars to increase capacity, and put emergency car-repair teams at select locations, among other things. The third, System Safety and Cleanliness, would increase the number of key stations with emergency medical technicians, maintain elevators and escalators efficiently, clean stations and repair components more frequently, add public service announcements warning against littering, and collaborate with the NYPD to enforce the law within the subway. The fourth, Customer Communication, entailed launching a dedicated MTA app; creating better announcements during service disruptions; and completing the installation of systemwide countdown clocks; while the fifth category, Critical Management Group, would consolidate operations and hire people to resolve incidents quickly. The $8 billion second phase would implement the winning proposals from the Genius Transit Challenge and fix more widespread problems. On July 27, two days after the release of the Action Plan, Governor Cuomo announced that his administration was working on a way for private sponsors to \\"adopt a station\\" for up to $600,000. The sponsors would be partially responsible for their station's aesthetics. City officials announced on August 6 that Mayor de Blasio would push for a tax on wealthy New York City residents to help pay for necessary improvements in the subway. The proposal would raise between $700 million to $800 million, with $250 million of it going for half-priced MetroCards for 800,000 riders at or below the poverty line‚Äîa shift from de Blasio's previous stance. To go into effect, it would have to be approved by the New York State Legislature. This proposal was criticized by Governor Cuomo and MTA Chairman Joe Lhota for not providing money soon enough, as the State Legislature would not go back into session until January 2018. R160 subway cars on the E route In October 2017, as part of the action plan, a hundred R160 subway cars on the E train were retrofitted to provide extra capacity of 8 to 10 passengers per car, and some older R46 cars were also similarly refurbished. Additionally, officials started piloting a new fare system compatible with the LIRR and Metro-North's eTix electronic tickets, and several unspecified L train cars were being retrofitted with seats that folded up during rush hours. Officials also changed all announcements containing \\"ladies and gentlemen\\" and replaced them with the more general terms \\"passengers\\", \\"riders\\", and \\"everyone\\", using gender- neutral terms ostensibly to improve passenger service.  Long-term solutions and proposals  In August 2017, Governor Cuomo drafted a proposal for congestion pricing in New York City, with the primary intent of raising funds for city transit and reduce street gridlock, while balancing suburban commuter considerations. In October, the New York State Government created a task force, Fix NYC, to find solutions for fixing mass transit and lowering congestion. A preliminary proposal was released in January 2018, although a final plan remains in debate. Mayor de Blasio, who initially opposed the congestion pricing plan, suggested a counter-proposal to raise taxes for the city's wealthiest residents. Coinciding with the transit crisis, the Regional Plan Association released its fourth Regional Plan on November 30, 2017, marking the first such plan since 1996. The plan, which had been prepared over the previous five years, suggested three changes for the subway system. The first suggestion was constructing eight subway lines in all four boroughs. The second suggestion was to modernize the system by shutting it down completely during weekday nights; renovating subway stations to include such amenities as elevators and platform screen doors; and reducing crowding, heat, noise, and pollutant levels in stations. The final suggestion was to accelerate the automation of the New York City Subway. The RPA has historically published many proposals that have been implemented, unlike other regional planning associations, whose plans are typically ignored. Improvements were also proposed for the bus system. These improvements included adding more bus lanes in New York City, which allow buses to use an exclusive bus lane without being blocked by other traffic. Traffic signal preemption, which changes traffic lights based on whether a bus is approaching, was also suggested for 1,000 traffic signals by 2020. In October 2017, de Blasio's administration announced that the city would add 21 Select Bus Service routes through 2027, adding to the existing 15-route system. The Select Bus Service lines implemented several methods to speed up service: passengers paid fares at booths on the sidewalk rather than aboard buses using all-door boarding, and the buses themselves used exclusive bus lanes. In April 2018, the MTA published a Bus Action Plan detailing 28 suggestions to improve the bus system. The improvements included expanding all-door boarding to all bus routes; simplifying bus routes; adding more dedicated bus lanes; enforcing bus lane rules; redesigning borough bus maps; purchasing more electric buses; and adding real-time boarding information to buses. The MTA also planned to test out a double-decker bus on the redesigned Staten Island bus routes. = New President = The MTA hired Andy Byford as the president of the New York City Transit Authority in November 2017. He assumed his new position in January 2018. MTA leadership expected that Byford would be able to devise solutions to fix the NYCTA's reliability issues, particularly those of the subway. Within the first few months of his job, Byford was devising long-term plans for the bus and subway systems. = Genius Transit Challenge = On May 23, 2017, Governor Cuomo officially announced the Genius Transit Challenge, where contestants could submit ideas to improve signals, communications infrastructure, or rolling stock. The winner of each of the three challenges was to receive a million dollars and have their idea implemented systemwide, though MTA employees were outright prohibited from applying. The program drew criticism from industry observers and MTA staff, as it created the perception that outside input was more valued by sheer virtue of coming from outside the agency, rather than any relevant industry experience, such as that of career transportation professionals who actually worked at the agency. The program was marketed to the tech industry and business professionals with little to no transit expertise, and was generally not promoted to private practitioners or researchers within the transportation industry itself. Nineteen finalists for the Genius Transit Challenge were announced in December 2017, out of 438 applicants from 23 countries. Most were established corporations such as Alstom, AECOM, Nokia, and MTA's cellular-service provider Transit Wireless, although two finalists were individual applicants. Six winning submissions from eight entities were announced in March 2018. = Fast Forward report = Prospect Avenue station in 2017, prior to the declaration of the transit crisis; it has since been renovated under the Enhanced Station Initiative Byford announced his subway and bus modernization plan at a MTA board meeting in May 2018. The plan involved upgrading signals on the subway system's five most heavily used physical lines; making 50 extra stations ADA-accessible; and installing an automatic train supervision system for routes that did not already have that system, which would help monitor train locations. The bus system would be streamlined and reorganized to make the service more reliable. The plan would cost $43 billion over 15 years, including an initial expenditure of $19 billion over the first five years. Ten lines would receive automated signaling system by 2028. In addition to increase capacity, and to reduce reliance on important interlockings, potential route changes will be evaluated. Also part of the plan was a new fare payment system that was to be implemented by 2020, as well as 3,650 new subway cars to be ordered by 2028, including 650 cars to be ordered by 2023. The program to add 50 more ADA- accessible stations during the 2020‚Äì2024 Capital Program would allow most riders to have an accessible station every two or three stops, and it would be more than double the 19 stations outlined in the then-current 2015‚Äì2019 MTA Capital Program. Byford's May 2018 proposal also included suggestions to improve the bus system. As part of the plan, the Staten Island express bus and Bronx local bus network would be re-evaluated, and bus priority measures would be added and enforced. Bus stops would be consolidated for faster service, and existing bus stops would be improved with bus shelters and real-time travel information. In order to get the MTA to work more efficiently, employee communications, processes, and hierarchies would also be reorganized. Conditions at stations will be improved through the appointment of \\"group station managers\\" to stations within a geographic area. In order to keep trains moving, New York City Transit started evaluating twenty places where signal timers affect service the most. Some of the locations included the IRT Lexington Avenue Line () between 14th Street‚ÄìUnion Square and Bowling Green; the IRT Eastern Parkway Line () between Atlantic Avenue‚ÄìBarclays Center and Franklin Avenue; the IND Fulton Street Line () between Jay Street‚ÄìMetroTech and Hoyt‚ÄìSchermerhorn Streets; and the BMT Jamaica Line and BMT Nassau Street Line () between Hewes Street and Bowery. Signal timers were added across the system since the fatal 1995 Williamsburg Bridge subway crash, so that trains would be spaced further apart, thereby increasing safety. Some timers were installed in places where extra train spacing was unnecessary, increasing delays and reducing capacity. In addition, some timers had stopped functioning properly, forcing train operators to operate more slowly to ensure that their train did not activate the automatic braking system if they passed the signals at too high a speed. As part of Byford's plan, New York City Transit would ensure that signal timers are being cleaned and are functioning. In fall 2018, two new initiatives would begin on selected lines to reduce delays. The first initiative would ensure that train crews will be at the terminal to allow their train to leave on time, while the second would add countdown clocks for train operators so they can maintain speeds. Under the Fast Forward report, New York City Transit would conduct a one-year pilot program in which it would increase off-peak bus frequencies on the Q6, Q69, B17, B65, and S93 bus routes in Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island. These improvements would be implemented between September 2018 and January 2019. The Bx6 local bus route in the Bronx would also get articulated buses by January 2019 in order to increase passenger capacity. A separate program would involve removing every other stop on the Q22 route in Queens, as well as adjust schedules and short turn certain bus trips based on demand, in order to increase bus reliability. The Q22 changes would become effective in September 2018. =2018 developments= SIM1 route, one of the bus routes added in the reorganized Staten Island express bus system The newly reorganized Staten Island express bus network went into effect on August 19, 2018. On August 20, the first weekday that the new bus network was in effect, commuters reported overcrowding on some bus routes and at the Eltingville Transit Center, while four experimental park-and-ride routes were largely unused. The following day, Andy Byford held the first town hall for the Fast Forward plan at York College in Jamaica, Queens. It was one of several such meetings scheduled for the plan. In internal emails released the same month, the MTA indicated that as a result of budget cuts, some subway staffing and car-cleaning jobs might be eliminated. In addition, the expansion of Select Bus Service in the outer boroughs might be halted until 2021 while the city's bus network was being re-evaluated. In the MTA's September 2018 board meeting, Byford stated that the subway was getting better. He said that in 2018, there were fewer major incidents that delayed 50 or more trains compared to in 2017, and the mean distance between failures (MDBF) for trains was higher than in the previous year. However, these figures included major- incident rates that were far above average in January 2018, and the MDBF figures in 2018 were much lower than in 2015. The transit advocacy group Riders Alliance stated that in August 2018, there was only one weekday where the subway system did not experience delays due to signal or equipment malfunctions. Subway trains had a 68% on-time rate in summer 2018; such a low reliability metric had not been seen since the 1970s transit crisis. Byford also stated that, thus far, the MTA had cleaned of track, fixed 1,300 signals, and modified 1,600 subway cars as part of the Fast Forward plan. At a subsequent event, Byford announced that 23 \\"group station managers\\" had been hired to manage groups of up to 25 stations each. In October 2018, New York state comptroller Thomas DiNapoli published a report stating that the MTA could have $42 billion in debt by 2022. This was exacerbated by the declines in subway and bus ridership, which could not be offset by higher fares alone. Standard & Poor's had already reduced the MTA's credit rating and bond rating from an A+ to an A earlier that year because of the MTA's financial issues and political infighting. Also that October, the MTA launched another competition, this one targeted toward technology companies. There were two challenges: one to reduce traffic congestion along bus routes, and one to predict and alleviate subway delays. With the upcoming 14th Street Tunnel shutdown starting in April 2019, which would suspend service on the to Manhattan for a year, the MTA and New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) finalized their mitigation plans for the shutdown. However, the mitigation plans were described by Curbed NY as inadequate, because of the lack of nearby subway routes that go directly to Manhattan; the lack of passenger capacity at key transfer stations; and the fact that nearly a quarter-million riders use the every day. Also in October 2018, it was revealed that the decline in subway ridership had accelerated in summer 2018, with a 2.5% decrease in weekday trips and an 8.8% decrease in weekend trips from August 2017 to August 2018. In a 60 Minutes television segment about the state of the subway, published on October 21, it was mentioned that the increasing delays had led to dissatisfied customers who, in some cases, had physically assaulted conductors. In the segment, Byford described how communications-based train control (CBTC) implementation was the key part of his Fast Forward plan, and that as a result of an investment of $800 million in emergency funds, critical maintenance of the subway was being carried out. However, though on-time performance had increased slightly since the plan's implementation, riders did not notice the improvements for the most part, according to Byford. By December 2018, the MTA had identified 130 locations in the subway system where the speed limit could be increased (or in some cases, doubled), as well as 267 faulty timer signals that needed to be fixed. After the failure of the congestion pricing bill in early 2018, officials decided to look for other ways to fund the subway. In December 2018, an urban policy think tank proposed legalizing marijuana for non-medical uses in New York state, then collecting a tax to fund the New York City transit system. The same month, the MTA announced that as many as four percent of subway riders and 16 percent of bus riders each day might not be paying fares, amounting to 208,000 subway riders and 384,000 bus riders per day. This indicated that the decline in ridership on the subway and bus systems might not be as severe as previously indicated, because ridership counts only included riders who paid fares. In response, Byford stated that the MTA was studying ways to physically prevent fare evaders from jumping over subway turnstiles, or entering the rear doors of buses where they did not need to pay. = 2019 developments = In early January 2019, Cuomo announced that the 14th Street Tunnel would not completely shut down. Instead, work would occur on weekends and nights, and construction could be finished in 15 to 20 months. Following the announcement, Cuomo stated that he wanted to \\"blow up\\" the MTA and restructure its entire operating hierarchy. The governor cited frequent cost overruns for MTA contracts, as well as a lack of clear leadership in the agency, as reasons to rearrange the agency. A few days later, de Blasio promised to improve the bus system in his State of the City address. His plan included raising bus speeds by 25% by the next year, increasing the enforcement of bus lanes, and adding bus priority signals to 1,200 intersections with traffic lights. Also in January 2019, the MTA announced that a new fleet of about 1,500 R262 subway cars, to be built in the 2020s, would replace the R62 and R62A fleets, which were built in the 1980s and are used on the subway system's numbered routes, in order to expedite CBTC on the Lexington Avenue Line. The MTA also announced that 95% of signal timers had been tested, resulting in the discovery of 320 faulty timers, and that 68 locations were improved for increases in speed limits. Byford also promoted some of the other changes made under the Subway Action Plan, including sealing leaks; improving drainage; repairing tracks and signal components; and replacing subway car components. One facet of the Subway Action Plan, a $9.5 million contract for an extensive cleaning of 3,000 subway cars and 100 stations, almost resulted in a strike among unionized subway cleaners. The strike was averted when the MTA ensured that the contract would be for a one-time cleaning and agreed to have two unionized workers at each cleaning site. In February 2019, Cuomo and de Blasio jointly announced a plan that outlined ten steps to fix MTA operations. Under this plan, similar operations in the MTA's subsidiaries would be combined, a form of congestion pricing would be enacted, a cap on fare increases would be reduced to 2% a year, and the Subway Action Plan would be sped up. To reduce unnecessary costs and delays, a fare evasion prevention strategy would be created, and new project contracts would be awarded as design‚Äìbuild contracts. In addition, board members' terms were tied to those of the official who appointed them, the MTA's capital programs would be reviewed by a committee of independent analysts, and the MTA would undergo an independent financial audit. The MTA, city, and state of New York would work with the state legislature to enact these provisions. Shortly after, Speaker of the New York City Council Corey Johnson unveiled a competing proposal to cede control of the city's subway and bus systems to the city. The MTA released another progress report in March 2019, stating that the subway's on-time rate had increased to 76%. However, a New York Times analysis of the data found that the gains were not spread equally: the A Division (numbered services and the 42nd Street Shuttle) had an average on-time rate of 79%, compared to the B Division (lettered services) 68% on-time rate. The disparity was attributed to the Automatic Train Supervision system used on much of the A Division; the CBTC signalling system used on the IRT Flushing Line (); and the opening of the Second Avenue Subway, which alleviated congestion on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line (). At the end of the month, the state approved a congestion pricing plan, to go into effect by 2021 at the earliest. As part of state legislation passed in April 2019, the MTA was supposed to create a plan to reduce costs by the end of June. A draft of the plan indicated that several departments would be eliminated, undermining Byford's role. Additionally, in May 2019, federal prosecutors started investigating alleged overtime fraud at the MTA, especially at the LIRR, which was thought to contribute to higher spending by the MTA. Following this, in July 2019, an MTA reorganization plan was published; the plan called for consolidating the MTA's 40 departments into six groups, as well as eliminating 2,700 jobs. Two incidents affected the subway system in July 2019. The first was the Manhattan blackout of July 13, 2019, which resulted in suspended or limited service on most lines going through Midtown Manhattan for several hours. The MTA closed four Manhattan stations, and all of the A Division routes suffered extensive delays. The second incident occurred less than a week later, during the rush hour of July 20, 2019, and in the mid of a citywide heat wave. An ATS system issue which caused service on most of the A Division routes to be suspended for more than an hour. In September 2019, the MTA released a draft of their proposed $54 billion 2020-2024 capital plan. The draft calls for adding accessible features to 66 additional subway stations and adding CBTC or other modern signaling systems to parts of six more physical lines. Additionally, the Second Avenue Subway would be completed. Much of the funding would come from the new Manhattan congestion charge. A draft plan for a reorganization of Bronx bus routes was proposed in draft format in June 2019, with a final version published in October 2019. Many of the draft proposals were not included in the final version due to community feedback. This was followed by the publication of the Queens bus route reorganization draft in December 2019, with the final plan expected in 2020. During 2019, annual subway ridership figures increased, reversing a ridership decline that had been ongoing since 2015. = 2020 developments = On January 15, 2020, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer delivered a letter to Byford, demanding that the MTA develop, and make public, plans for restoring the \\"abundance\\" of shuttered entry points along New York City Subway routes currently contributing to severe overcrowding and longer commute times. A week later, on January 23, 2020, Byford officially resigned his position at the NYCTA, citing frequent conflicts with Cuomo. The New York Times later wrote that these conflicts had been gradual disagreements, rather than any single event, but that the \\"Byford-Cuomo estrangement was highly unusual\\", since New York state governors and MTA chiefs had previously interacted very little prior to the mid-2010s. During the COVID-19 pandemic, People seen with face masks practicing social distancing. The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to New York state, and thus to the New York City area, in March 2020 resulted in mass closures of gathering spaces such as restaurants and schools. Though the subway, bus, and railroad systems remained open, ridership across all modes of transportation started to decrease, after the MTA recommended that only essential workers use the public transit system. On buses, riders were instructed to use the back door, making the bus system effectively fare-free. Following a 50% to 90% drop in ridership on all of the MTA's systems, the agency requested $4 billion in federal funds, since the decreased fare revenue left the already-struggling agency in a financially tenuous position. By March 25, following further ridership decreases, service on buses, subways, and commuter rail was reduced to at most 75% of their regular service levels. The subway system's five part-time services, the B, C, W, Z, and 42nd Street Shuttle, were temporarily suspended. Despite this, because of increased headways between trains, smaller ridership decreases were reported in poorer neighborhoods than in wealthier areas, and trains were reportedly crowded, despite social distancing guidelines put into place during the pandemic. After at least 41 MTA workers had died and 6,000 others had gotten sick or self- quarantined by April 8, many workers alleged that the MTA had done too little to protect workers from contracting COVID-19, even as up to 40% of daily trips had to be canceled due to crew shortages. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the subway began temporary overnight closures in May 2020, the first such planned closure in the system's history. By mid-April, ridership on the subway had decreased by 92% due to the pandemic. Bus ridership dropped less, with some routes retaining up to half their normal ridership. To cover a potential revenue shortfall of up to $8.5 billion, the MTA faced having to cut service more permanently, or deferring capital improvements, even though transit experts said that the New York metropolitan area could not function without an effective transit system. On April 20, four City Council members requested that subway service be temporarily suspended due to the spread of COVID-19 in the subway system, but interim New York City Transit president Sarah Feinberg opposed it. Other politicians such as de Blasio advocated for shutting down some terminal stations overnight to clean the trains. The number of homeless individuals in the subway had also increased, a situation that Cuomo described as \\"disgusting and disrespectful\\". Starting on May 6, 2020, stations were closed overnight for cleaning, in what became the first planned overnight closure in the subway's history. The overnight closures would be a temporary measure that would be suspended once the pandemic was over, and during the overnight closures, bus service was added. During the closures, trains and stations were cleaned more than usual. The NYCTA announced that families of workers who died of COVID-19 would be eligible for $500,000 in death benefits. Ridership on the subway started to increase at the end of May, as the rate of new COVID-19 cases decreased, though bus ridership had surpassed subway ridership. On June 8, regular service resumed with Phase 1 of the city's reopening, though the overnight subway closure remained in place. On June 22, MTA Chairman Pat Foye reported that roughly 95 percent of mass transit riders were adhering to wearing face masks in accordance with state executive order No. 202.17 from April 15, and that 24/7 service would return to the subway once the pandemic ended. From April to June, bus ridership was greater than subway ridership for the first time since the MTA started keeping these records in the 1960s; bus speeds increased on average by 19%. In conjunction with this, in June, de Blasio announced that additional busways would be installed citywide. However, continued budgetary issues forced the MTA to suspend all capital projects \\"indefinitely\\" due to a deficit that could grow to $10 billion by 2022. At a meeting in August 2020, the MTA stated that without $12 billion in federal funding to cover operations in 2020 and 2021, the agency would need to take extreme measures such as eliminating capital projects, reducing staff, raising fares and tolls, cutting Access-A-Ride service, cutting service on the LIRR and Metro-North by 50%, and cutting service on the subway and bus systems by 40%. The MTA was losing $200 million per week at the time. In the wake of such a large deficit, front-door entry on buses was reinstated on August 31.

Biography  Mustafa Hamed Moh Arruf, born in Melilla (Spanish city located in North Africa), in 1958. He began his artistic studies at the School of Applied Arts and Artistic Trades in his hometown and continued his training in Fine Arts in the city of Granada (Spain). His early vocation is painting and sculpture and, although he has worked with materials such as wood, stone (in Holland) and bronze, it is with this material that he best expresses his art. In the mid-eighties, he moved to Germany, where he performed various works presented at the House of Spain in Frankfurt. After a brief residency in Holland, he moved to Madrid, in the nineties, an artistically very productive period, and worked with the MAGISA Bronze Foundry and the Art Gallery Series. Later he works in the public program of Taller Schools and Oficio Houses, where he performs different teaching tasks, until he obtains a position as a restorer in the Archaeological Museum of the city of Melilla. As the whole of his work, his urban sculpture ‚Äîwhich is exhibited in squares, streets, avenues, parks and gardens of different countries‚Äî and public ‚Äîwhich is exhibited in centers of different administrations‚Äî presents an important diversity, in which Artistic (ornamental) elements are combined with expressive (conceptual) elements. Homage to Fernando Arrabal, 1994 A group of his works ‚Äîpromoted by public or private institutions, and made from his beginnings as a sculptor, in 1985, until today‚Äî the form busts or statues of famous people born or linked to his hometown: to teaching (Juan Caro Romero, 1985), to painting (Victorio Manch√≥n, 1994), to the letters and theatrical representation (the playwright Fernando Arrabal, 1994, the poet Miguel Fern√°ndez, 1994, and the actor and theater director Antonio C√©sar Jim√©nez Segura, 2007), and architecture (Enrique Nieto, 2008). Another grouping forms more avant-garde sculptures, with strong contrasts in its design: flat/ volume, soft/rough, hard/soft and, above all, diagonal/circular, with quarters of moon that makes his works contain a dynamic balance and tension. In 1997 he won the contest that the Autonomous City of Melilla had convened for the commemoration of the V Centennial of his Spanish foundation with the work Encuentros, his most monumental and popular sculpture, although not the most successful in the opinion of its creator. A replica of half of it is in the Juan Carlos I Park, in Madrid, at the foot of which there is transcribed a sonnet by Fernando Arrabal. Another replica of the other half is in the Park of the Three Cultures, in the city of Toledo. The sculptor ‚Äîaware that an author should not interpret his work since the composition in the art of occupying the space depends, more than in any other discipline, on the point of view‚Äî makes an exception here with limitations: Meetings. (Melilla, 1997) In 2002 he developed a group of female sculptures, promoted by the Consejer√≠a de Obras P√∫blicas of Melilla, which that year had decided to allocate one percent of the budget in culture for embellishment of the city. These are works with figurative aesthetic ascription, with geometric formulation and predominance in spiral rotation.

According to IDEAS/RePEc, Lundberg belongs to the top 2% of economists in terms of her research. = Research on the labour economics of households= One area of Lundberg's research concerns the labour economics of households. In her seminal 1985 paper, Lundberg developed the concept of the added worker effect, which explains countercyclical increases in the labour supply of married women as responses to their husbands' cyclical unemployment.*Lundberg, S. (1985). The Added Worker Effect. Journal of Labor Economics, 3(1), pp. 11-37. In further work, Lundberg finds that the labour supply of married couples remains separately determined as long as the couples don't have children of preschool age; thereafter, the working hours of families become highly correlated and display negative cross-earnings effects.Lundberg, S.J. (1988). Labor Supply of Husbands and Wives: A Simultaneous Equations Approach. Review of Economics and Statistics, 70(2), pp. 224-235. Together with Elaina Rose, Lundberg finds that the effects of parenthood on the earnings and hours worked of married men and women strongly vary on the continuity of the mother's attachment to the labour force and on the child's gender: if the wife's employment is interrupted, the fall in the hours worked and wages of the wife is partly offset by an increase in the labour supply and earnings of the husband, whereas in the opposite case fathers' hours worked decrease strongly; moreover, all else equal, fathers tend to increase their labour supply and wages substantially more in case of a son than if they have a daughter,Lundberg, S., Rose, E. (2000). Parenthood and the earnings of married men and women. Labour Economics, 7(6), pp. 689-710.Lundberg, S., Rose, E. (2002). The Effects of Sons and Daughters on Men's Labor Supply and Wages. Review of Economics and Statistics, 84(2), pp. 251-268. a finding in line with further work by Lundberg on child gender bias.Lundberg, S. (2005). Sons, Daughters, and Parental Behaviour. Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 21(3), pp. 340-356. = Research on intrahousehold bargaining= A second area of Shelly Lundberg's research addresses bargaining within married couples. In a seminal paper with Robert A. Pollak, Lundberg developed the \\"separate spheres\\" bargaining model, wherein spouses don't threaten each other with divorce but rather with the adoption of a non- cooperative separate spheres approach to the marriage, with important implications for marriage market and the distributional consequences of transfer policies.Lundberg, S., Pollak, R.A. (1991). Separate Spheres Bargaining and the Marriage Market. Journal of Political Economy, 101(6), pp. 988-1010.Lundberg, S., Pollak, R.A. (1994). Noncooperative Bargaining Models of Marriage. American Economic Review, 84(2), pp. 132-137. Relatedly, Lundberg and Pollak are critical of \\"common preferences\\" (unitary) models of households compared to household models that involve intra-household bargaining and emphasize spouses' relative control over resources.Lundberg, S., Pollak, R.A. (1996). Bargaining and Distribution in Marriage. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 10(4), pp. 139-158. In line with this view, Lundberg, Pollak and Terence Wales observe that the reallocation of child benefits to wives in the UK was associated with substantial increases in households' expenditures on women's and children's clothing.Lundberg, S.J., Pollak, R.A., Wales, T.J. (1997). Do Husbands and Wives Pool Their Resources? Evidence from the United Kingdom Child Benefit. Journal of Human Resources, 32(3), pp. 463-480. Lundberg and Pollak have also challenged the notion that bargaining in marriages generally results in efficiency, arguing that inefficient outcomes may occur if current decisions can be expected to affect future bargaining power.Lundberg, S., Pollak, R. (2003). Efficiency in Marriage. Review of Economics of the Household, 1(3), pp. 153-167. Together with Startz and Steven Stillman, Lundberg has also studied the sudden drop in consumption associated with the retirement of male household heads, which she explains through the shift in control over household income due to retirement and wives' preference to save more because of their relatively higher life expectancies.Lundberg, S., Startz, R., Stillman, S. (2003). The retirement-consumption puzzle: a marital bargaining approach. Journal of Public Economics, 87(5-6), pp. 1199-1218. = Research on the economics of teenage pregnancies= A third area of Lundberg's research deals with the economics of premarital adolescent fertility. In research with Robert Plotnick, Lundberg observes important differences between the responsiveness of Caucasian and Afro-American adolescents' premarital pregnancies, pregnancy outcomes and prenatal marriages to welfare benefits, abortion laws and family planning policies, with Afro- Americans' behaviour being essentially unaffected by these policy variables.Lundberg, S., Plotnick, R.D. (1995). Adolescent Premarital Childbearing: Do Economic Incentives Matter? Journal of Labor Economics, 13(2), pp. 177-200. The importance of racial differences in the effects of teenage pregnancies is also reflected by Lundberg and Plotnick's finding (together with Daniel Klepinger) that having a child before age 18 significantly reduces educational attainment only among Afro-Americans, though significant negative effects can also be observed for Caucasians and Hispanics with regard to childbearing before the age of 20.Klepinger, D., Lundberg, S., Plotnick, R. (1999). How Does Adolescent Fertility Affect the Human Capital and Wages of Young Women? Journal of Human Resources, 34(3), pp. 421-448. By reducing young women's educational attainment, teenage childbearing also is found by Lundberg, Klepinger and Plotnick to significantly depress young women's wages, offering a further rationale for public policies aimed at reducing teenage pregnancies.Klepinger, D.H., Lundberg, S., Plotnick, R.D. (1995). Adolescent fertility and the educational attainment of young women. Family Planning Perspectives, 27(1), pp. 23-28. = Other research in labour economics, population economics and family economics= In early work with Startz, Lundberg developed an influential model of statistical discrimination in competitive labour markets wherein social welfare could be maximized by policies prohibiting group-specific discrimination.Lundberg, S., Startz, R. (1983). Private Discrimination and Social Intervention in Competitive Labor Markets. American Economic Review, 73(3), pp. 340-347. Together with Rose, Lundberg finds that sons tend to accelerate the transition of women into marriage if the husband is also the son's biological father, though child gender doesn't affect mothers' remarriage probabilities when the children are born within a previous marriage.Lundberg, S., Rose, E. (2003). Child gender and the transition to marriage. Demography, 40(2), pp. 333-349.

Biography Born on 22 March 1872 in Copenhagen, Anna Marie Louise Sandholt was the daughter of the physician Peter Boll Wivet Sandholt (1827‚Äì90) and Louise Victoria Aagaard (1848‚Äì1920). After being brought up by a well-to-do family, she began to study art at the Tegne- og Kunstindustriskolen for Kvinder (Arts and Crafts School for Women). From 1892 to 1901, she continued her studies at the Kunstakademiets Kunstskole for Kvinder (Academy's Art School for Women). In 1902 she finished \\"Joy of Motherhood\\" which embodies the idea of fertility and the naturalness of having children. Her real introduction to painting, however, occurred later when she was working as a maid in the home of the painter Viggo Pedersen (1854‚Äì1926) in Skamstrup near Holb√¶k. This contributed significantly to her artistic education. At a time when women artists were more active in textiles than in painting, Sandholt stood out as an oil painter who took her work extremely seriously. In 1905, she returned to the Arts and Crafts School for Women, this time as an embroidery teacher. In addition to embroidered works, she designed porcelain figures for Bing & Gr√∏ndahl. On one of her study trips to Italy, she met the Norwegian painter Christian Krohg who helped her develop her technique and composition. One of her most notable early works is Morgengl√¶de (Morning Joy, 1902) depicting a mother with her four children in a double bed, inspired by Johansen's pictures of family life. She went on to paint naturalistic, outdoor scenes in a freer, more nuanced style. Her landscapes, sometimes with figures, often depicted trees and forests. She had developed a special liking for them as so many had been destroyed in the north of France during the First World War. On occasion, she also painted portraits including one of the actor Johannes Poulsen in Twelfth Night. She exhibited at Kunsthal Charlottenborg from 1895 to 1943 but also arranged a number of solo shows throughout the country.

During Parker's high school career, the wonders averaged 287 yards rushing per game and completed 62.4 percent of its passes. College career Parker's tall and lanky frame was a point of concern and limited the number of schools interested in recruiting him for football. In an interview with Brian McLaughlin of Herosports.com, Parker said \\"I really wasn't highly sought after coming out of high school, because of my frame, and I didn't have really good film my junior year; My senior year, I didn't really get any kind of accolades. You had to come to my school to know anything about me. I was a much slimmer guy, if you can believe that...With schools like Alabama and Clemson, they're looking for the guy who is ready to go right now.\\" Parker received full scholarship offers from Division II Winston-Salem state, FCS North Carolina A&T;, North Carolina Central; a partial scholarship from his father's alma mater North Carolina; & preferred walk-on spots from then FCS Appalachian State, Charlotte, & FBS Duke.

Parker finished his season with a number of accolades, including All-American honors from both American Urban Radio Networks and Boxtorow. Parker was also named the MEAC Offensive Lineman of the Year; becoming the second player in the program's history to win the award behind Qasim Mitchell who won in 2001. =2016 season= Parker started all 12 games of the 2016 football season, earning MEAC offensive lineman of the week a total of five times.

American arts journalist for the New York Times Grace Glueck noted that Steele was a \\"progressive-minded artist and artisan whose work was considered avant-garde.\\" She married a farmer, Nielson Parker, in 1926. After he died in 1928, Steele traveled extensively in Europe, Haiti, and the Bahamas. She returned to upstate New York and died in New Jersey at 98 years of age. A retrospective exhibition, Zulma Steele: Artist/Craftswoman, was held in 2020 at the Kleinert/James Center for the Arts of the Woodstock Byrdcliffe Guild. The catalogue and accompanying essays constitute the most comprehensive scholarship on Steele's work to date.  Career  In the late 19th century, the Arts and Crafts movement grew in response to, and as rejection of, the rapid urbanization and mechanization of society during the Second Industrial Revolution. In the winter of 1902, construction of the Byrdcliffe Colony began on Mount Guardian outside of Woodstock, New York. The serene 1,500-acre commune was the brainchild of wealthy Englishman Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead. The son of a British textile Baron, Whitehead was attempting ‚Äúto create a subsistence community of craftsmen,‚Äù wrote New York Times journalist Benjamin Genocchio in 2003. During the beginning of art production at Byrdcliffe, activity centered around the production of furniture. Zulma Steele was one of the first residents at the Byrdcliffe Colony and was considered one of the most talented students to come there. In 1903, she and Edna Walker, who both had recently graduated from the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, arrived in Woodstock to work in the furniture shop. Steele had long-time family ties to the Woodstock area. The two women made nature studies of local plant life for what became the iconic patterned- painted panels that were set into the larger Mission style furniture pieces. The types of objects made in the furniture shop at Byrdcliffe included tables, chairs, lamp stands, hanging shelves, bookcases, sideboards and chiffoniers. ‚ÄúSimple lines, delicate moldings, and planar surfaces characterized Byrdcliffe pieces and belie their solid construction,‚Äù wrote curator Peter Morrin in preparation for a 1977 exhibition on the Woodstock colonies. Zulma Steele attended the 1913 Armory Show in New York City. Her immediate response to the European modern art is not known however the evolution of her art shows an impact. Professor of Art History at Bard College, Tom Wolf, noted that the \\"artists of Byrdcliffe practiced the most popular and accepted styles of the early twentieth century, and it is striking to see a sudden change around the time of the 1913 Armory Show.\\" During World War I, Steele worked with the Red Cross in France. She studied in Paris with the Cubist Andr√© Lhote and took classes at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re and Acad√©mie Colarossi art schools. The influences of Cubism became evident in Steele's artwork. In 1907, the Byrdcliffe Pottery opened. Zulma Steele worked there for many years and managed the facility for the last five of those years, until its closing in 1928. She then started her own line of pottery called, ‚ÄúZedware.‚Äù Steele became a lifelong resident of the Woodstock area. She was described by her contemporary, the artist Bolton Brown, as ‚Äúan outstanding lady both visually and in quality we call style.‚Äù  Notable works  *Purple Hills, c. 1914, Oil on Board, 20.32 cm √ó 25.4 cm *Drawing, Iris Desk Panel. 1904, Graphite and Color Pencil on Paper *Drop Front Desk with 3 Iris Panels, 1904, Oil Paint and Green Stain on Cherry Wood. *Byrdcliffe No. 4, c. 1914, Oil on Board, 20.32cm √ó 25.4cm 127.95 cm x 98.42 cm √ó 40.64 cm  Exhibitions  *Boston Art College (1894, 1896, 1899) *National Academy of Design (1891), *Art Institute of Chicago *National Arts Club (1914) *Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts *Boston Museum of Fine Art *Baltimore Museum of Art *Ohio University *Indiana State University *Paradox Gallery *Woodstock, New York 1980s (solo) *Milwaukee Art Museum (2020)  References  Category:1881 births Category:1979 deaths Category:20th-century American women artists Category:Arts and Crafts movement artists Category:Artists from Ohio Category:School of the Art Institute of Chicago alumni Category:Pratt Institute alumni Category:School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts alumni ","title":"Zulma Steele"},{"id":"56966301","text":"Strophidia caudata is a moth of the family Uraniidae first described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1781.

History George Basevi designed the Hall in the Early Tudor style in 1836, \\"with mullioned windows and a cross above the central gable\\", and the Marquess of Bristol donated nine acres of land to build the school. Rev. Henry Venn Elliott founded the school for the \\"daughters of poor clergy\\" in 1836. Elliott chose to locate the Hall in Brighton because \\"the Prince Regent had made it a popular place to live\\", and Elliott believed there would be many wealthy families in that locale seeking governesses. Early school registers, however, do not show many graduates were thus employed. In 1838, the school had 50 students. By 1861, the school had 120 students, and the school's Patron was the Archbishop of Canterbury, its President, the Bishop of Chichester, and its Secretary and Treasurer, Rev. H.V. Elliott. The school's chapel and concert hall, formerly St Mark's Church, was consecrated in 1849. Built by Thomas Shelbourne in Early English style, it has an 1860 memorial window and monument to the Marquess of Bristol. In 1860, contributions and legacies totaled ¬£1319, and pupils' payments, ¬£2,812. In 1877, the Handbook for Travellers to Sussex described the school as \\"an excellent institution for education orphan daughters of clergymen as governesses, on payment of ¬£20 per annum\\". The Hall was expanded in 1920 when daughters of laymen were admitted. A new hall was added in 1969, and in 1976 the school erected a classroom block and swimming-pool. Venn House for sixth- formers was added in 1981, and the school added a junior school block in 1983, and a pre-preparatory block in 1989. By 1990, the school had more than 400 pupils. = School merger and closure = School officials considered admitting boys during 2007. St Mary's reported ¬£1.93 million in debts in 2008, as well as losses in four of the previous five years. Eventually, St Mary's Hall, Brighton, was merged with Roedean School in 2009 due to \\"economic circumstances\\" that \\"left it with no choice but to close and end 173 years of independence\\". When Roedean closed St Mary's Hall in 2009, eleven remaining teachers lost their jobs.

Developed and marketed by Meteodyn, Meteodyn WT was first released in September 2009. The software quantifies the wind resource in a desired terrain in order to assess the feasibility of a proposed wind farm. The software‚Äôs objective is to design the most profitable wind farm. This is achieved by taking into account the measured wind data at a measurement tower and the terrain conditions. Both of these are essential to be able to obtain the wind conditions and therefore the wind resources of the desired terrain. Meteodyn WT has been validated with actual wind measurements by independent studies. Meteodyn WT is used by wind turbine manufacturers, wind farm developers, consulting firms and wind farm operators.  Graphical user interface  The current version of Meteodyn WT displays all projects in one world map; this map already includes terrain and roughness data.  Features  Meteodyn WT features a geographical data management tool, a meteorological data processing tool, a LIDAR correction tool, a wind turbine creation tool, a wind turbines micro-siting tool, a wind atlas tool and an auto-convergence tool. It also includes the following functions: wind resource mapping, wake effect computation, annual energy production (AEP) with / without wake effect, directional wind shear at each turbine, wind and turbulence matrices at each turbine, IEC compliance, automatic report generation, losses and uncertainties.  Compatibility with other software  The current version of Meteodyn WT exports to the following wind energy software formats: .wrg, .rsf, .wrb, .fmv and Flowres. Google earth and Surfer export formats are also available.  Solution method  Meteodyn WT uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) which directly takes into consideration the geometry of the terrain in question. The software solves the Navier-Stokes equations numerically by using the K-L turbulence model. This technique to solve the Navier-Stokes equations takes into account the stability of the atmosphere.  Language  Meteodyn WT is available in English, French, Standard Chinese and Spanish.  Ports  = Microsoft Windows = Meteodyn WT is a proprietary software package created for Microsoft Windows and usually, any new Meteodyn WT version supports the current Microsoft Windows version and some older ones.

Early years (1832‚Äì70) Vincent-Marie Farinole was born on 1 September 1832 in Sigean, Aude. His parents were Joseph Farinole(fr) (1792‚Äì1887) and Philippine Beno√Æte Mathieu. He came from an old Coriscan family with several members who were notable before the French Revolution. He attended a Jesuit school for a classical education, then went on the Lyc√©e Charlemagne and the Lyc√©e Saint- Louis in Paris. He studied law at the University of Aix-en-Provence, then after obtaining his license enrolled as an advocate at the Bar of Bastia in 1856, where he pleaded until 1870. He married around 1865 and had a daughter, Magdeleine Juliette Louise Cl√©lie Farinole (1872‚Äì1946). Although his family had ties with the Bonapartistes of Corsica, Farinole held strong Republican opinions and was an opponent of the Second French Empire. In 1869 he was one of the co-founders of the weekly La Revanche with Patrice de Corsi, Louis Tommasi and L√©onard Limperani. There was a violent controversy between the editors of this paper and prince Pierre Napol√©on Bonaparte. During it Farinole sent a letter to the Paris correspondent Paschal Grousset that made him send witnesses to challenge the prince to a duel. One of the Grousset's witnesses was Victor Noir, who would be tragically killed in Auteuil. Farinole campaigned against the 1870 constitutional referendum in Corsica and publicly voted \\"No\\" on 8 May 1870. Third Republic (1870‚Äì1905) After the fall of the empire on 4 September 1870 Farinole's life was in danger in Corsica and he went to Paris as an officer of the National Guard to defend the capital. On 4 September 1870 Adolphe Cr√©mieux, Minister of Justice of the National Defense Government, appointed Farinole public prosecutor in Bastia, Corsica. In 1873 Jules Armand Dufaure appointed him a judge in Le Havre. He returned to Bastia as Advocate General. He was dismissed by the first cabinet of Albert de Broglie after the fall of Adolphe Thiers on 25 May 1873. In 1879 under the government of William Waddington he was appointed adviser to the Bastia court of appeal by the Minister of Justice Philippe Le Royer. He was then named honorary adviser to the court of appeal of Aix-en-Provence. He was elected in turn general councillor of the cantons of Murato and Ghisoni. He became vice- president of the Corsican general council. Farinole was elected Senator of Corsica on 7 January 1894, holding office until 3 January 1903. He was elected in the first round of voting by 409 votes against 349 for Nicolas P√©raldi and 272 for Ange Muracciole. He sat with the Republican Left group. In the senate he denounced abuses in Corsica by political appointees in the island's judiciary, called for improvement of maritime and postal links to the island, called for action against forest fires and deforestation, called for a stronger garrison, pointed out health issues and submitted a proposal to fight electoral fraud. He failed to be reelected in the 1903 renewal, when Muracciole and √âmile Combes were elected. Farinole died on 16 September 1905 in Bastia.

He also did work for the White House Council on Aging. Eli Productions was based in Washington from 1969 until O‚ÄôToole retired in 1992. Earlier, it was based in New York.  Film work  O‚ÄôToole was executive producer of the PBS television series Modern Maturity in the 1980s. The show, which was underwritten by AARP, featured Diane Rehm and was seen by an estimated 6 million viewers a week on 250-plus PBS stations. O'Toole said he found \\"a lot of things pitched to older people demeaning\\" so he created the show, which also featured Edwin Newman and Marlene Sanders. ‚ÄúAging is a lifetime process,‚Äù O‚ÄôToole said in 1988 about Modern Maturity, which was aimed at adults over 50. ‚ÄúYou're always involved in it. As you get into it more personally, you're somebody's mother, then somebody's grandmother, and so on. We had to project an image on camera of mature adults doing things. You don't see people over 40 on commercial television ‚Äì on shows that have some vitality anyway. So we set out to do that.\\" Before founding Eli, O‚ÄôToole wrote the film Who Killed Mary Whats'ername (1971) (Death of a Hooker). In addition to Red Buttons and Sylvia Miles, the film also features Conrad Bain (Diff'rent Strokes), Alice Playten, Sam Waterston and David Doyle (Charlie‚Äôs Angels). Ernest Pintoff was the director, and Gary McFarland wrote the soundtrack music. In 1992, O‚ÄôToole took up painting. His paintings were exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, the Torpedo Factory Art Center in Alexandria and the Rehoboth Art League in Delaware. He began blogging at the age of 80 and wrote for the Huffington Post as well as his own blog, Eli's Observations, until his death in 2013. O'Toole married Ellie Barbo O'Toole in 1963. They have two daughters: Caitlin O'Toole, also a writer, and Sarah O'Toole Perry; and two grandchildren.

She has published three books of photography: Hutterite: A World of Grace (1998), Americana (2000) and Brasil (2016). Capp's work has been exhibited both nationally and internationally. Her work is included in collections at the Whitney Museum in New York, the Lyman Allyn Art Museum in Connecticut, the International Center of Photography in New York and the Harvard Art Museum. She was one of sixty international artists selected for the G√∂teborg International Biennial for Contemporary Art in 2017. Her work has appeared in the Bursa International Photofest in Turkey, as well as in Switzerland, France, Belgium, Germany and the United States.  Education  Kristin Capp was born in Portland, Oregon in 1964, and grew up in Seattle, Washington. Capp studied French and Russian at McGill University, Quebec, Canada where she also enrolled in a photography class. She then lived in New York City, studying analog photography and fine art printing. In 2010, Capp received a Fulbright Fellowship to work on a project title Picturing Communities: A Photographic Documentary of Non-Profits in Rural Namibia: The Application of Digital Photography in Art, Advertising and Personal Documentary.  Work  In 1994, Capp photographed a Hutterite community in eastern Washington state. Hutterites, like the Amish and Mennonites, are descended from sixteenth century Anabaptists, and retain many traditional agrarian ways. The book that resulted from this work, Hutterite: A World of Grace, explored this community's blend of old and new and was distinguished, as one reviewer put it, by its ‚Äútender and mysterious‚Äù square black-and-white photographs of young Hutterite women that evoke ‚Äúthe existence of an interior complexity within their beautifully plain exteriors.‚Äù Over a period of eight years, Capp traveled frequently to Brasil, where she shot 800 rolls of film on a Rolleiflex. In the result of this work, Brasil (2016), Capp eschewed the usual imagery of carnival and exoticized sexuality for black-and-white photographs of \\"street culture, landscape, architecture and the visual magic she encountered in Rio de Janeiro.\\" To complete the project, Capp crowd-funded to cover costs of layout, design and shipping. The project foregrounds Capp's aesthetic concerns with marginalized communities and the book was published by the Italian fine-art publisher Damiani. In 2012, while on a Fulbright, Capp created a collection of photographs titled The Horse Latitudes. The exhibit, as a journalist put it, was \\"Inspired by nature, light and the complexity of the cultural, social and natural landscape\\" of different regions of Namibia.

The command must decide on removing the submarine from combat duty and sending the crew to quarantine. The cause of the disease is discovered to be leakage of one of the warheads. There are no treatments and the crew is confined to the ship until an antidote is found.

Eventually, the captain can no longer withstand the prolonged torture of this strange disease; after unsuccessful attempts to board the ships enforcing quarantine of \\"Archelon\\", he fakes the destruction of his submarine and gives the order to sink the passing vessels.

Career  Burleigh was working as a professional cartoonist by 1921, when her cartoon, Pigtails, appeared in the Chicago Tribune. This comic strip ran until 1923. According to comic historian Allan Holtz, Pigtails focused on daily experiences of young girls, including family life, chores, and childhood aspirations. Her focus on girlhood distinguished her from her colleagues, such as Clare Briggs and John T. McCutcheon, who developed their comics from a masculine point-of-view. After Pigtails ended in 1923, she created the series Kitty and Her Family. Kitty was mentioned by name in advertisements for the Chicago Tribune's Sunday subscriptions, ending with the tagline \\"Fun for everyone--man, woman, or child.\\" Little is known about Burleigh's career after 1924, but she appears in the 1930 and 1940 censuses in New York City, working as a \\"freelance artist\\" and later as a \\"freelance advertising cartoonist.\\" During this period, she likely created an undated lithograph, \\"Clown,\\" which resides in the Martin W.

Biography Yang Tongyan graduated from Beijing Normal University with B.A. in History (1982). He worked as teacher, also at civil service and as a freelance writer. His works were published in the internet. He was accused by Chinese government in actions against revolution after Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and was imprisoned from 1990 to 2000. Then Tongyan wrote many of his works in prison. He was member of the Independent Chinese PEN Center. He was arrested and then held in a detention centre since December 2005. In May 2006, Tongyan was sentenced to 12 years of prison for publishing of criticism on the Chinese government, and sent in prison in the City of Nanjing. He had tuberculosis, peritonitis and was treated in hospital in 2010, but his application for medical parole was denied then. Tongyan was released on medical parole for treatment of aggressive form of brain cancer in hospital of Shanghai in August, 2017.

Chinese authorities pressured Yang's relatives to cremate body and bury ashes in sea while keeping this information about the burial in sea in secret, but a Yang's friend had known about it and leaked this to a human rights group. Amnesty International considered Yang Tongyan as a prisoner of conscience who was persecuted by Chinese government for his fight for human rights. Works *China permeated with fear - is a short essay about Chinese society that has tendency to jump in panic when some calamity happened instead to solve source of accident.

In March 2018, during the third Test match against South Africa at Newlands in Cape Town, Cameron Bancroft was caught by television cameras trying to rough up one side of the ball with sandpaper to make it swing in flight. Captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner were found to be involved and all three received unprecedented sanctions from Cricket Australia. Although he was found not to have been directly involved, Australia's coach, Darren Lehmann, announced he would step down from his role following the scandal. Smith was replaced by Tim Paine as Test captain, and Aaron Finch as T20I and ODI captain. Background In March 2018, the Australia national cricket team toured South Africa to play four Test matches against the South Africa national cricket team. On 24 March 2018, after lunch on the third day of the third Test match, Australia's Cameron Bancroft was shown on the television coverage and on screens at the ground appearing to rub the ball with a small yellow object. After Bancroft realised that he had been seen, he was again shown on the television coverage and on screens at the ground hiding the object in the front of his trousers. He was then approached by the umpires, and he showed them a dark microfibre sunglass pouch from his pocket. The umpires inspected the ball, and chose neither to offer the ball to the South African team to replace it if they wished, nor award them five penalty runs, the options available to the umpires under Law 41.3 of the Laws of Cricket. This indicated that the ball had not been altered in any noticeable way. At the press conference at the end of the day's play, Bancroft, accompanied by Australia's captain, Steve Smith, admitted that he was shown attempting to alter the condition of the ball using a short length of yellow adhesive tape to which dirt and grit had adhered, forming an abrasive surface. Five days later, and after an investigation into the incident by Cricket Australia, he admitted it was sandpaper, which cricketers use to maintain their bats. Smith also admitted that he knew of the plan in advance of Bancroft's actions. Smith said that the plan was made during the lunch break by the \\"leadership group\\", which he did not name. Smith said it was a \\"big mistake\\", and when questioned by the media, said that he would not be standing down as captain of the team. Andy Pycroft, the match referee, charged Bancroft with a Level 2 offence of attempting to alter the condition of the ball. David Richardson, CEO of the International Cricket Council (ICC), charged Smith with \\"conduct of a serious nature that is contrary to the spirit of the game\\". Smith accepted the charge and the proposed sanction of two suspension points, which equated to a ban for the next Test match, four demerit points being added to his record, and was fined 100% of his match fee. Bancroft accepted the charge against him, was handed three demerit points and fined 75% of his match fee. Response Following Smith's admission, Australia's Prime Minister at that time, Malcolm Turnbull, said it was a \\"shocking disappointment\\". He phoned Cricket Australia (CA) Board chairman David Peever directly to express that disappointment and concern, saying that there has to be the strongest action taken. The Australian Sports Commission requested that Smith stand down immediately, and the incident was widely condemned by former international players and officials. In a press release dated 25 March 2018, CA CEO James Sutherland apologised to fans and confirmed that both Smith and Warner had agreed to stand down from their roles of captain and vice-captain respectively for the remainder of the match. In the same release, David Peever announced that Tim Paine, the team's wicket-keeper, had been endorsed by the Board of CA to step in as acting captain, and Smith and Warner would take to the field under him. South Africa went on to win the Test match by 322 runs. =Cricket Australia investigation= Cricket Australia launched its own investigation into the incident, led by Executive General Manager Team Performance, Pat Howard, with CA Senior Legal Counsel and Head of Integrity Iain Roy. CA CEO James Sutherland joined the investigators in South Africa. On 27 March 2018, before the findings of that investigation were handed down, opening batsman Matt Renshaw was recalled to the squad from Australia ahead of the fourth Test. On 27 March 2018, Sutherland announced that as a result of the preliminary investigation Smith, Warner and Bancroft had been charged with bringing the game into disrepute, suspended and would be sent home. He said that further sanctions against the three players would be announced within 24 hours, and that CA was satisfied that no one else was involved. He added that as well as Renshaw, opening batsman Joe Burns and all- rounder Glenn Maxwell were added to the squad to replace them, and confirmed that Paine had been appointed captain for the fourth Test. There was no announcement about the vacant vice-captain position. =Findings= During a meeting on 28 March 2018 lasting over two hours, the Cricket Australia Board considered the report. The three players were sanctioned by Cricket Australia for breaching article 2.3.5 of Cricket Australia's Code of Conduct by engaging in conduct that was contrary to the spirit of the game, unbecoming of a representative, harmful to the interests of the game, and/or which brings the game into disrepute. Warner was found to be responsible for the development of the plan to alter the condition of the ball and instructing Bancroft on how to do it, including demonstrating the technique to him. He was also found to have failed to prevent the plan being implemented, misled match officials by concealing his knowledge of the plan and not voluntarily reporting his involvement. He received a twelve-month suspension from \\"all international and domestic cricket\\" and he \\"will not be considered for team leadership positions in the future.\\" Warner drew flak from a lot of people, many of them his own countrymen, who believed him to be the reason behind the whole scandal. In the Amazon documentary series about the scandal, The Test, Warner opened up on his struggles and road to getting the respect he lost back in the 12 month ban period he served. Smith was found to have known of the plan but failed to take steps to prevent it, told Bancroft to conceal the sandpaper in his trousers, misled match officials and others regarding Bancroft's attempts to artificially alter the condition of the ball, and made misleading public comments regarding the nature, extent and participants of the plan. He received a twelve-month suspension \\"from all international and domestic cricket\\" and he \\"will not be considered for team leadership positions until a minimum of 12 months after the conclusion of [his suspension] from international and domestic cricket. Any consideration of future leadership would be conditional on acceptance by fans and the public, form and authority among the playing group.\\" Bancroft was found to be a party to the plan to tamper with the ball, that he carried out Warner's instructions, tried to conceal the evidence and made statements to mislead match officials and the public. He received a nine-month suspension from \\"all international and domestic cricket\\" and he \\"will not be considered for team leadership positions until a minimum of 12 months after the conclusion of [his suspension] from international and domestic cricket. Any consideration of future leadership would be conditional on acceptance by fans and the public, form and authority among the playing group.\\" As well, \\"[a]ll three players will be permitted to play club cricket and will be encouraged to do so to maintain links with the cricket community. In addition, all three players will be required to undertake 100 hours of voluntary service in community cricket.\\" Ahead of the decision, Smith and Warner had stepped down as captains of the Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad respectively in the 2018 Indian Premier League (IPL). On 28 March 2018, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced that neither Smith nor Warner would be able to play in the 2018 IPL. Bancroft was contracted to play for English side Somerset in the 2018 County Championship season. On 29 March 2018, Somerset announced that \\"Bancroft will not be our overseas player for the 2018 season\\" and that \\"the club's best interests were at the centre of our decision\\". Western Australian Cricket Association CEO Christina Matthews confirmed that under their current rules Bancroft cannot play grade cricket because of his suspension. However, she added, a rule change is under consideration. Sutherland specifically addressed repeatedly broadcast footage of coach Darren Lehmann. It showed him on a walkie-talkie to 12th man Peter Handscomb at the side of the field after the vision of Bancroft was broadcast. Hanscomb then ran onto the field to speak with Bancroft. Sutherland said that the CA investigators were satisfied that Lehmann \\"sent a message to say 'What in the hell is going on?'‚Äì he didn't use 'hell', he used another word\\", referring to an expletive and that he was not aware of the plan. =Responses from players and coach= Darren Lehmann stepped down after the fourth Test against South Africa following the controversy Warner was the first to respond publicly. In a tweet dated 29 March 2018, he apologised for his part in the incident, and took responsibility for his role in it. He said that he would spend some time with his family, friends and trusted advisers, and would make another statement in the coming days. He later arrived at Sydney Airport with his wife and two young daughters, and when confronted by media, repeated that he would make a statement in the coming days, and that his priority was to get his family home. Bancroft arrived in Perth on 29 March 2018, and gave a press conference at the WACA. An emotional Bancroft expressed disappointment, regret and remorse, admitting that he had failed as a role model and in the eyes of the broader community, and that when confronted on the field by the umpires and media about his actions he panicked. He asked for forgiveness and said that he would be contributing back to the community. Smith arrived in Sydney later that day. In a press conference at Sydney Airport, a tearful Smith started by saying that he had nothing to add to Cricket Australia's report. He said that as captain of the Australian cricket team, he took full responsibility, and that he had made a serious error in judgement: \\"It was a failure of leadership, my leadership.\\" As well as apologising to his \\"teammates, to fans of cricket all over the world and to all Australians who are disappointed and angry\\", he specifically referred to the effect that the incident had on his parents, causing him to break down, and implored others faced with questionable decisions to consider their parents. He added, \\"I know I will regret this for the rest of my life. I'm absolutely gutted. I hope in time I can earn back respect and forgiveness.\\" Australia's coach Darren Lehmann was cleared by the investigation of any wrongdoing or involvement in the scandal, and said that he would not resign. Of the findings and sanctions, he said that he was \\"embarrassed\\" and \\"disappointed\\", adding that he hopes people will give all three players a second chance. However, on the same day that the three players returned home, Lehmann announced that he would step down from his role after the conclusion of the fourth Test in Johannesburg. He said in his statement that after watching the press conferences of Bancroft and Smith, \\"the feeling is that Australian cricket needs to move forward and this is the right thing to do.\\" On 31 March 2018, an emotional Warner gave a press conference in Sydney. In it, he described his actions as inexcusable and deeply regrettable. He apologised for the breach of trust and his actions, accepting full responsibility for the part he played in the incident, and said that the next twelve months would be a tough and emotional time for him. His priority at this time is the wellbeing of his family. While he hoped to play for Australia again, he is resigned that it will not happen. He will spend the coming weeks and months looking at himself \\"as a man\\", and will seek advice and expertise to make \\"serious changes\\". He supports a CA investigation into the culture of the Australian cricket side. When asked, he said that he would sit down with family, friends and advisers before deciding on his playing future. Some noted that he deflected multiple questions about whether he was the ringleader of the plan or others' involvement in it. =Disputing the charges and sanctions= In the press release announcing the findings and sanctions, Cricket Australia summarised the review process. \\"The Code of Conduct process in this instance is as follows: * A report is lodged by the CEO with the Head of Integrity; * A review is completed by the Head of Integrity; A Notice of Charge (in conjunction with the report) is provided to the player which includes a specific charge under the Code of Conduct and offers the proposed sanctions; * If the player accepts the charge and proposed sanctions, the matter is completed; * If the player disputes either the charge or sanctions, there is a hearing before a CA Commissioner; * The player may appeal the outcome of that hearing, and if so there is a hearing before an Appeals Commissioner (who is selected from the remaining CA Commissioners).\\" It was reported on 31 March 2018 that Bancroft had sought legal advice and is considering his options. It was further reported on 1 April 2018 that all three had sought legal advice and are considering their actions, and importantly that while they all acknowledge erring in Cape Town, they had not formally accepted or challenged their charges or their sanctions issued by CA. It was also reported that Smith and Warner were expected to push for a relaxation of the sanctions, particularly to allow them to play domestic cricket in Australia and overseas. James Sutherland of CA had previously said that the legal advice they had received was that they did not have jurisdiction requiring other national cricketing bodies to enforce the sanctions. \\"Under the code we didn't have any clear authority over domestic matches played overseas,\\" he said. \\"It was talked about but we ascertained based on the legal advice that we didn't have that clear authority. On 4 April 2018, Steve Smith confirmed that he would not challenge the sanctions. In a tweet, he said \\"I would give anything to have this behind me and be back representing my country. But I meant what I said about taking full responsibility as Captain of the team. I won't be challenging the sanctions. They've been imposed by CA to send a strong message and I have accepted them.\\" Also on 4 April 2018, Cameron Bancroft announced that he had advised CA that he accepted the sanction. He tweeted \\"Today I lodged the paperwork with Cricket Australia and will be accepting the sanction handed down. I would love to put this behind me and will do whatever it takes to earn back the trust of the Australian public. Thank you to all those who have sent messages of support\\" On 5 April 2018, David Warner announced that he has accepted the CA sanctions. In a tweet, he said \\"I have today let Cricket Australia know that I fully accept the sanctions imposed on me. I am truly sorry for my actions and will now do everything I can to be a better person, teammate and role model.\\" Cricket Australia, in a press release dated 5 April 2018, confirmed that \\"Smith, Bancroft and Warner have officially advised Cricket Australia they have accepted the charges and sanctions, and no hearings will be required.\\" CA CEO James Sutherland added that \\"These are significant penalties for professional cricketers. They were not imposed lightly. We know the players will return to playing the game they love, and in doing so, we hope they rebuild their careers and regain the trust of fans\\". =Cultural review= When announcing the initial findings against Bancroft, Smith and Warner on 27 March 2018, James Sutherland announced that there would also be a deeper review of the \\"culture and conduct\\" of Australia's professional cricket teams. The terms of reference of that inquiry is to find a means by which supporters of Australian cricket and the wider community can effectively refresh their commitment to the sport. Further details of the review will be forthcoming, but it will seek input from 'relevant experts', especially to determine how the culture of the Australian men's test side arrived at the point at which it has found itself. Former Australian captain, selector and CA Board member Allan Border welcomed the review, saying that \\"The Australian cricket team itself is not a popular cricket team, and a lot of their antics on the field have upset a lot of people.\\" On 6 April 2018, Cricket Australia chairman David Peever announced that former Test batsman Rick McCosker will chair an independent review into cultural, organisational and governance issues, and a player-driven process to set out a charter setting out standards for improved player behaviour and expectations of the Australian men's national side. He is expected to be joined by two former players and two current players on a panel, with that quartet yet to be named. That process will form part of the wide-ranging review, which will provide recommendations to the Cricket Australia board. Peter Collins, Director of the Centre for Ethical Leadership and a consultant on ethics, leadership and organisational change will act as a \\"facilitator\\" for the process. Peever added that the review will take \\"whatever time is necessary\\". The chief executive of the ICC, Dave Richardson, addressed a news conference on 27 April 2018 about harsher punishments for ball-tampering and other misbehaviour. Responses to the investigation and sanctions Before the start of play of the fourth Test between Australia and South Africa on 30 March 2018, newly appointed Australian captain Tim Paine, with the support of his players, approached South African captain Faf du Plessis. After the national anthems were played, both teams shook hands on the field as a gesture of goodwill and respect. Paine hopes that this will become a ritual that symbolises the new direction and attitude his team is taking after the fallout from Cape Town. While no one contended that the charges and findings against Bancroft, Smith and Warner were not justified, many argued that the sanctions were unprecedented, and that there were flaws in the Cricket Australia (CA) description of the incident. Some did not separate the event‚Äîan attempt at ball tampering‚Äîfrom the wider charge brought against the trio of bringing the game into disrepute. On 29 March 2018, the Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA), which represents the professional first-class cricketers of Australia, released a statement setting out \\"a number of glaring and clear anomalies in the process to date which causes the ACA to query the severity and proportionality of the proposed sanctions.\\" It went on to say that \\"The ACA continues to provide welfare and legal support to all players\\" and that \\"All Australians would understand the right of the players to receive advice from their advisers, peers and family and the time necessary to ensure the sanctions are fair and proportional.\\" Some see this as the ACA foreshadowing a challenge to CA over the process and sanctions. Du Plessis, who was found guilty of ball tampering in 2013 and again in 2016, sent Smith a text message expressing his sympathy. He said that \\"he's one of the good guys and he's just been caught in a bad place\\". He agreed when asked if he thought that the sanctions were too harsh. He noted that the sanctions imposed by CA were far greater than those imposed by the ICC for the same incident, and may send a message to the ICC that \\"maybe they need to sharpen up.\\" Shane Warne, former Australian Test bowler who served a one-year ban for breaching the CA drug code in 2003, condemned the trio for engaging in \\"premeditated cheating\\", but believed that the public reaction to the incident resulted in excessive penalties being handed down by CA. English cricket commentator Mark Nicholas wrote \\"Clearly the captaincy had to go, and equally clearly the vice- captaincy. The punishment that has followed has been extremely severe, and I cannot help but think of Smith and Bancroft.\\" Former Indian captain Sachin Tendulkar argued that the right decision had been made to uphold the integrity of the game, adding \\"Winning is important but the way you win is more important.\\" However he defended them, saying that the Australian cricketers have dealt with enough criticism. He also urged media and cricket fans to spare thoughts for their families and that they should be given some breathing space. Former South African captain Herschelle Gibbs said, \\"Hard scenes watching the interviews. Having been through it all, take it on the chin and live with the consequences but remain true to yourself.\\" Former Australian captain and commentator Ian Chappell said that CA were right to ban Smith and Warner for twelve months, adding that he did not expect Smith would captain Australia again because he had lost the respect of the players. On the duration of the ban, he said \\"if they would have only given six months to them and they tried to play in Australia's next summer, the booing and crowd reaction would have been so bad. It would have been very hard for the players and it would not have been a very good situation for Cricket Australia.\\" Former England captain Michael Vaughan thought the bans too harsh, but noted that CA had sent a message to players. Former Australian batsman Tom Moody believed that the punishment did not fit the crime. Indian commentator Harsha Bhogle said that \\"I honestly do not believe any other country would have handed its captain and lead player a one-year ban for attempted ball- tampering.\\" Meanwhile, former Indian batsman and commentator Sanjay Manjrekar was not surprised by the sanctions. Other cricketers came out in support of the banned players, saying that punishment was too harsh, including Harbhajan Singh, Russel Arnold, Michael Di Venuto and Adam Hollioake. Gautam Gambhir, the former captain of the IPL side Delhi Daredevils commented that the sanctions imposed on Smith and Warner are quite harsh, and suspected that both may have paid for their roles in a 10-month pay dispute with CA that was resolved in August 2017. In a tweet he asked the Australian media and the public to spare thoughts for the families of the disgraced cricketers rather than mocking them. Gambhir also said that \\"I may be quite emotional but Smith doesn't look to me a cheat.\\" Some criticised CA for its handling of the incident. Former Australian captain Michael Clarke believed that there was more to the incident than CA CEO James Sutherland had said, tweeting \\"The truth, The full story, Accountability and Leadership- until the public get this Australian cricket is in deep shit!\\" and that \\"To [sic] many reputations on the line for the full story not to come out. Cape Town change room is a very small place!\\" Michael Vaughan was similarly unconvinced, suggesting that Cricket Australia has only made things worse for itself by finding that only three players were involved. Former England wicket-keeper Matt Prior said the official explanation didn't match up with his experiences of how teams work. Former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff was skeptical that other Australian players, particularly the bowlers, were not involved. Former England batsman Kevin Pietersen was unconvinced that coach Darren Lehmann did not know of the plan, while BBC broadcaster Jonathan Agnew believed that there were contradictions in the official narrative. Commercial fallout From the outset, many of Cricket Australia's commercial sponsors and partners, including 2018 South African tour naming rights sponsor Qantas, Twenty20 naming rights sponsor Sanitarium, One Day International and Big Bash League naming rights sponsor KFC, domestic Test match naming rights sponsor Magellan Financial Group, Lion XXXX, the Commonwealth Bank, and Bupa expressed their disappointment and shock over the incident. Many demanded a comprehensive explanation from CA, and demanded that they take steps to protect the long term reputation of the sport they had invested in. On 29 March 2018, Magellan Financial Group terminated its three-year naming rights sponsorship agreement with CA in response to the ball-tampering scandal. The contract had two more seasons to run, and was estimated to be worth AU$20 million. The incident came as CA was negotiating television broadcast rights to all forms of the game for the next six seasons, estimated at one point to be valued at greater than AU$900 million. Bidding has not been as high as CA expected, and some expect that the ball tampering incident may further affect those negotiations. =Player contracts= On 28 March, Smith and Warner were banned from the 2018 edition of the IPL. Both the players were going to make A$2.4 million. On 11 April 2018, Cricket Australia announced the list of 20 players who have been awarded national contracts for 2018‚Äì19. Bancroft, Smith and Warner were not on that list, and they were not mentioned in the media release. In April 2018, Surrey county head and former Australian cricketer Michael Di Venuto shared that his county is open for county deal for David Warner. =Individual sponsorships= The LG Electronics company in Australia announced that they had chosen not to renew their personal sponsorship of Warner on 27 March 2018, citing \\"recent events\\". Warner had been in a commercial arrangement with LG since 2014. That arrangement was in its final weeks and was being considered for renewal at the time of his suspension. As well as this incident, his behaviour came under the spotlight during the first Test of the tour after the dismissal of South African batsman AB de Villiers. He was then involved in a highly publicised personal and escalating verbal altercation with South African batsman Quinton de Kock as they were leaving the field. Warner's teammates intervened to separate them. Both were charged by the match referee and penalised. Earlier in this Test, Warner was involved in a heated exchange with a spectator after being dismissed in Australia's first innings. The spectator was ejected from the ground. On 29 March 2018, sporting apparel company ASICS terminated their commercial arrangements with Warner and Bancroft. The Commonwealth Bank terminated their brand ambassador arrangement with Smith, as did Sanitarium for whom Smith was an ambassador for their Weet- Bix product. Return to cricket Bancroft was the first of three banned players to return to Australian professional cricket. On 30 December 2018, he represented the Perth Scorchers in the 2018‚Äì19 Big Bash League season. In the match he scored two runs from three balls, with the Hobart Hurricanes going on to win the game by six wickets. The bans on Smith and Warner ended on 29 March 2019, coinciding with the date of the fourth One Day International (ODI) match of Australia's series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, however neither made their international return until the first match of the 2019 Cricket World Cup. The trio made their returns to the Test arena at Edgbaston on 1 August in the first Test of the 2019 Ashes series, with Smith‚Äôs scores of 144 and 142 earning him the man of the match award as Australia beat England by 251 runs. In February 2020, Smith and Warner were named in Australia's limited overs squads for their tour to South Africa. They both played in the opening Twenty20 International (T20I) match of the tour, the first time they had represented Australia in South Africa since their bans.

Background  Several days before the incident, the Serbian media was reporting about a decorated ≈ΩS 711 train. They claimed that it was supposed to re-establish the connection between Serbia and Kosovo, after almost two decades of inactivity. The train had a livery painted in the colours of the Serbian flag and the inscription \\"Kosovo is Serbia\\" written in 21 different languages, including Albanian. The train interior was decorated with frescoes from monasteries of the Serbian Orthodox Church, located in Kosovo. The author of the train livery, graphic designer Andrej Vasiljeviƒá, stated that by designing such a train, he wants to \\"show the world Serbian cultural heritage using artistic expression, and make clear to everyone to whom Kosovo belongs\\". He also said that his initiative was supported by the Serbian Government and Serbian national passenger railway company Srbija Voz. On the 14th of January, Kosovo's president, Hashim Tha√ßi, published a Facebook post in which he stated that the aforementioned train had to be prevented from entering Kosovo, due to its \\"nationalist stickers\\", which are not in accordance with Kosovo's laws and constitution. Tha√ßi later ordered his Minister of Interior and Supreme Director of Police to prevent the train's arrival in Kosovo at all costs, after the Government of Kosovo consulted the European Union (EU) which responded that this \\"wasn't their concern\\".  Incident and the immediate aftermath  The train departed from Belgrade at 4 am on 14 January 2017, and was supposed to reach Mitrovica, Kosovo, after more than 19 hours of travel. It was nevertheless stopped in Ra≈°ka, the final railway station before crossing Kosovo's national borders, due to allegations that the railway tracks up ahead were mined. Afterwards, the train's passengers were switched to buses, which transported them all the way to Mitrovica, while the train returned to Belgrade the following day. Serbian President Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá then summoned a National Security Council Session, after which he accused Kosovo's police of mining the tracks and planning to arrest the train's engineer and all its passengers. He also said that it was his decision to stop the train in order to \\"prevent the wider conflict and show that we want peace\\". The Kosovan police later searched the tracks for explosives and found none.  Reactions  Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá stated that he will notify the United States, the European Union, and China of the fact that Kosovo \\"plays war games\\". He also said that it is his last appeal to Albanians in Kosovo not to attack Serbs, because Serbia will not allow these attacks. Serbian President Tomislav Nikoliƒá stated that he would send the Serbian Army to Kosovo if Serbs were killed. He also connected the incident with the then- leaving Barack Obama administration in the White House. The Serbian Minister of Labour, Employment, Veteran, and Social Policy, Aleksandar Vulin, stated, \\"If it wasn't for the calm and very wise reaction of Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá, we would have bloody fights on Northern Kosovo.\\" Kosovo's Prime Minister, Isa Mustafa, stated that \\"everything that happened\\" in regards to the arrival of the train from Belgrade to Mitrovica was an unnecessary situation caused by Serbia, and it is part of the \\"malicious intentions of Serbia to destabilize the situation in Kosovo\\". The American ambassador to Kosovo, Greg Delawie, said that he is concerned about the train issue and \\"called for the restraint of all parties\\".

The murder has been officially described by French authorities as an anti-Semitic hate crime. Murder There are two alleged assailants, Yacine Mihoub and Alex Carrimbacus. One, a 29-year-old neighbor of Knoll, who suffered from Parkinson's disease, and had known her since he was a child, and the other, an unemployed 21-year-old. The two suspects entered the apartment and reportedly stabbed Knoll eleven times before setting her on fire. The older suspect told investigators that the younger suspect asserted ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a Jew. She must have money.‚Äù The two suspects have accused each other of the stabbing, one of them claiming that the other shouted Allahu akbar as he stabbed her.

Suspect Yacine Mihoub, 28 years of age, the son of Knoll's neighbour, was previously known to authorities as he had sexually assaulted the daughter of Knoll's assistant, who was 12 years old at the time. Mihoub served a few months in prison and was released in September 2017. Suspect Alex Carrimbacus, 21 years of age, was acquainted with Mihoub in prison. Funeral The funeral procession, held on March 28, drew thousands of mourners who walked solemnly through the streets of Paris. They walked from the Place de la Nation to Knoll's apartment building in the 11th arrondissement. Knoll was buried at the Cimeti√®re parisien de Bagneux.

It is placed in the subgenus Microthele, making its full name Holothuria (Microthele) fuscopunctata. Description A large sea cucumber, H. fuscopunctata reaches a maximum length of , although a more usual length is about half this. It can weigh up to . The body wall is thick and golden-brown with darker spots and dark brown wrinkles. The underside is whitish, the mouth being surrounded by twenty thick brown tentacles and the anus surrounded by a black band. The cloaca is large and black, but there are no Cuvierian tubules. Distribution and habitat H. fuscopunctata has a wide distribution in the tropical Indo-Pacific. Its range extends from Madagascar and the eastern coast of Africa to Japan, China, Australia and the Mariana Islands, Palau and New Caledonia. Its depth range is down to a maximum of ; it is common in some parts of its range, but scarce in the Philippines, Federated States of Micronesia, and Marshall Islands. On the African coast it mostly occurs on sandy seabeds and seagrass meadows, but in the Central Pacific, it mostly occurs on reef slopes and on coral rubble, although it also lives in seagrass beds. Biology This species feeds on organic material that it grazes on the seabed. It is slow to mature and has low fecundity. The sexes are separate and breeding takes place in the warm season, between December and January. Status Sea cucumbers are eaten in the Central Pacific. H. fuscopunctata is not particularly esteemed, but it is eaten as a poverty food in times of hardship, such as after cyclones. It is mostly harvested by skin-diving, and is likely to face greater exploitation as other more favoured species become scarcer. There are fisheries in Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia; in Madagascar; in the Western Pacific, including the Torres Strait, and in Tuvalu. For the time being, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\", but it is vulnerable to over-exploitation because of its low fertility rate.

It is owned by a communal special purpose association formed by the province of Lower Bavaria, the counties of Rottal-Inn and Freyung-Grafenau, and the municipalities of Massing and Mauth. The museums are under academic leadership.  Finsterau Open-Air Museum  Living room of the Petzihof The Kapplhof The Finsterau Open-Air Museum lies in the municipality of Mauth at the edge of the village of Finsterau in the Bavarian Forest near the Czech border. It has farmhouses, complete farmsteads, a village smithy and a roadside inn from across the Bavarian Forest. The everyday life of farmers and day labourers in this region was hard. In the Finsterau Open-Air Museum, everyday things, like tools or woven cloth, are displayed in their original context. Festivals, markets and special exhibitions are hosted in which the craftsmen and women demonstrate their handiwork. In the Ehrn, the old roadside inn from Kirchaitnach, the museum visitors may eat and drink. = Farms = * Kapplhof: The museum opened in 1980 with the Kapplhof. The house and farmyard were changed, repaired, and extended several times. It preserves the design of the Waldlerhaus type of farmhouse as it emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries in the small villages and hamlets of the inner Bavarian Forest. The living quarters and cattle shed are united under a gently pitched gable roof covered in shakes, the carefully divided grain barn is covered by a similar roof and even the livestock shed is built in a similar fashion. * Tanzer-Hof: The Tanzer-Hof existed for barely 100 years. 31 tagwerks of wood, meadow and fields, and an undeveloped farmyard in the Angerdorf of Einberg were taken in 1879 for Michael Tanzer from the large farm of his brother. But it was too little: the colourful fa√ßade and the artistic decoration of the bedchamber could not compensate for the fact that the real estate for a farm was insufficient. * Sachl: The occupants of the Sachl from Rumpenstadl never thrived. The arable fields were too poor, the meadows too small and there was no woodland. That is why the old wooden house is so austerely built. The livestock shed and cellar are small, the living room, kitchen, and chamber are narrow, the furniture is old and worn out. * Petzi-Hof: Never before has a farm of this size with all its buildings been transported to an open-air museum in its entirety. The Petzi-Hof from P√∂tzerreut consists of a large residential and storage house (Wohnspeicherhaus), Inhaus, Austragshaus and baking oven, cowshed (Kuhstall), oxen shed (Ochsenstall) and grain store (Stadel). The 1704 farmhouse is the oldest, the 1927 Stadel is the most recent building. Woods and large, fertile fields made the Petzi-Hof into a wealthy property. Despite that, the furnishing of the living rooms and bedrooms is modest. The centrepiece of each living room is the bricked stove. * Schanzer- H√§usl: Opened in late 2007, the Schanzer-H√§usl from Riedelsbach in the Bavarian Forest is a real Bohemian Forest house. This type of house occurred both in the inner Bavarian Forest as well as the inner Bohemian Forest. The house was built between 1826 and 1840 and was occupied until 1963. The characteristic feature of this house type is the large hipped roof, covered in shakes, which reaches to the ground floor, and covers a living area built from logs and livestock sheds mostly made from natural rocks. Living rooms, cattle shed and grain store is united under one roof.  Massing Open-Air Museum  Schuster√∂derhof Heilmeierhof Bedchamber in the Marxens√∂lde Balcony of the Marxens√∂lde dating to 1885 The Massing Open-Air Museum was founded in 1969 and was one of the first museums of its type in Bavaria. Initially only the most attractive buildings from the rural Rot valley were displayed, which included wooden houses, painted cupboards and chests, Kr√∂ning pottery, embroidery, and turned ware. Since then, more everyday objects have been presented. With the Marxens√∂lde farm came the world of the small farmers, with the Kochhof the fascination of technology: winch wells, tractors, vaulted stables, enamelled pots, bowls, and buckets. Orchards, field boundaries, hedges and avenues have been created. The Spring Market (Lenzmarkt), Solstice Festival (Sonnwendfest), Harvest Beer Festival (Arntbierfest), and Museumskirta are highlights of the museum year. = Farms = Between the rivers, Rott and Inn lay the home of the Kochhof, the Heilmeierhof came from a village on the edge of the broad Isar valley, the Lehnerhof stood in the middle of the hop gardens of the Hallertau and the farmhouse of the Schuster√∂derhof had its original location not far from Massing. *Schuster√∂derhof: the Schuster√∂derhof, with which the museum in Massing started, remains in the condition it was acquired in 1969. To its furnishings belong items of farming life in the Rott valley, like its double balcony with its turned balusters and the Arma Christi cross on the barn (Stadel). *Kochhof: the centrepiece of the museum is the Kochhof. Peacocks, chickens, pigs, cats, a flock of doves, and often, cattle are at home here. Everything on this farm is in its places as it was around 1930. The entirely wooden farmhouse with its two balconies is a typical \\"Rott valley farmhouse\\". The two-floor (zweitennige) Bundwerk barn with the year 1836 painted on it indicates the wealth of the Kochhof farmer. *Freilinger H√§usl: The Freilinger H√§usl is presented as a 'bare' architectural monument. Its fate was that it stood empty most of the time or was used as a shed. As a result, this farmhouse, which is one of the oldest in Lower Bavaria, has survived. The log farmhouse, balcony (Schrot), and shingled roof (Legschindeldach) have characterised the external appearance of Lower Bavarian farmhouses for centuries. *Marxens√∂lde : the unit farmhouse (Wohnstallhaus) of the Marxens√∂lde is dated to 1887 in its balcony boards. Everything that belonged to a small farm is gathered here under one roof. *Lehnerhof: from the Hallertau comes to the Lehnerhof. Its owner lived by farming hops, pig mast, and dairy cattle.

On the first question, studies are mixed. Several recent, extensive studies‚Äìincluding one conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and one conducted by the American Automobile Association (AAA)‚Äìshow that drivers with detectable THC in their blood are no more likely to cause car crashes than drivers with no amount of THC in their blood.Eric M. Langton, Regulating Cannabis-Using Drivers: Why Per Se Laws Are Scientifically Invalid, 34 W. Mich. U.T.M. Cooley L. Rev. 367, 387 (2018)Andrea Roth, The Uneasy Case for Marijuana as Chemical Impairment Under a Science-Based Jurisprudence of Dangerousness, 103 CAL. L. REV. 101, 105 (2015). Others show that cannabis can impair certain abilities important to safe driving (such as reaction time, divided attention, and cognitive functions)‚Äìbut no studies have been able to show that this increases the actual risk of crashing, or that drivers with THC in their blood cause a disproportionate number of crashes. On the second question, the studies that have been conducted so far have consistently found that THC blood levels and degree of impairment are not closely related. No known relationship between blood levels of THC (the main psychoactive substance in cannabis) and increased relative crash risk, or THC blood levels and level of driving impairment, has been shown by single-crash or classic- control studies. Thus, even though it is possible that cannabis impairs driving ability to some extent, there are currently no reliable means to test or measure whether a driver was actually impaired. Nonetheless, policymakers in the United States have generally dealt with cannabis-and-driving criminalization by importing the alcohol DUI regime into the cannabis context. This has led to complications down the road when cannabis-driving cases land in criminal court because cannabis detection science differs vastly from alcohol detection science. For example, blood alcohol content (BAC) has similar rates of absorption, distribution, and elimination across all humans, and there is also a fairly good correlation between BAC and level of impairment (in other words, impairment increases when BAC increases, and impairment decreases when BAC decreases). This has allowed law enforcement to use tools like breathalyzers and blood tests in criminal court because alcohol concentration is a relatively reliable indicator of how recently and how much alcohol was consumed. In contrast, THC levels can vary widely depending on the means of ingestion, THC is metabolized at an exponentially declining rate (as opposed to the steady metabolization rate for alcohol), and there is very poor correlation of THC blood levels with impairment. As stated in a report to Congress produced by the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \\"[I]n contrast to the situation with alcohol, someone can show little or no impairment at a THC level at which someone else may show a greater degree of impairment.\\" The report also noted that, in some studies, THC was detectable as late as 30 days after ingestion‚Äìeven though the acute psychoactive effects of cannabis last only for a few hours. Effects on driving While several studies have shown increased risk associated with cannabis use by drivers, other studies have not found increased risk. In the largest and most precisely controlled study of its kind carried out by the U.S. Department of Transportation‚Äôs National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to research the risks of cannabis and driving, it was found that other \\"studies that measure the presence of THC in the drivers' blood or oral fluid, rather than relying on self-report tend to have much lower (or no) elevated crash risk estimates. Likewise better controlled studies have found lower (or no) elevated crash risk estimates\\". The study found that \\"after adjusting for age, gender, race and alcohol use, drivers who tested positive for marijuana were no more likely to crash than those who had not used any drugs or alcohol prior to driving\\". The study however cautions that \\"these results do not indicate that drug use by drivers is risk-free.\\" A 2012 British Medical Journal meta-analysis indicated that \\"drivers who consume cannabis within three hours of driving are nearly twice as likely to cause a vehicle collision as those who are not under the influence of drugs or alcohol\\" and found that acute cannabis use increased the risk of an automobile crash. In Cannabis and driving: a review of the literature and commentary, the United Kingdom's Department for Transport reviewed data on cannabis and driving, finding \\"Cannabis impairs driving behaviour. However, this impairment is mediated in that subjects under cannabis treatment appear to perceive that they are indeed impaired. Where they can compensate, they do, for example ... effects of driving behaviour are present up to an hour after smoking but do not continue for extended periods\\".Cannabis and driving: a review of the literature and commentary (No.12). nationalarchives.gov.uk. Retrieved on 2016-12-19. The report summarizes current knowledge about the effects of cannabis on driving and accident risk based on a review of available literature published since 1994 and the effects of cannabis on laboratory based tasks. The study identified young males, amongst whom cannabis consumption is frequent and increasing, and in whom alcohol consumption is also common, as a risk group for traffic accidents. The cause, according to the report, is driving inexperience and factors associated with youth relating to risk taking, delinquency and motivation. These demographic and psychosocial variables may relate to both drug use and accident risk, thereby presenting an artificial relationship between use of drugs and accident involvement. Kelly, Darke and Ross show similar results, with laboratory studies examining the effects of cannabis on skills utilised while driving showing impairments in tracking, attention, reaction time, short-term memory, hand-eye coordination, vigilance, time and distance perception, and decision making and concentration. An EMCDDA review concluded that \\"the acute effect of moderate or higher doses of cannabis impairs the skills related to safe driving and injury risk\\", specifically \\"attention, tracking and psychomotor skills\\". In their review of driving simulator studies, Kelly et al. conclude that there is evidence of dose-dependent impairments in cannabis-affected drivers' ability to control a vehicle in the areas of steering, headway control, speed variability, car following, reaction time and lane positioning. The researchers note that \\"even in those who learn to compensate for a drug's impairing effects, substantial impairment in performance can still be observed under conditions of general task performance (i.e. when no contingencies are present to maintain compensated performance).\\" An extensive 2013 review of 66 studies regarding crash risk and drug use found that cannabis was associated with minor, but not statistically significant increased odds of injury or fatal accident. The estimated fatal crash odds for cannabis (1.26) were lower than: opiates (1.68), antianxiety medications (2.30), zopiclone (sleep medicine) (2.60), cocaine (2.96), and amphetamines (5.17). The estimated injury odds for cannabis (1.10) were lower than: antihistamines (1.12), penicillin (1.12), antianxiety meds (1.17), antidepressants (1.35), antiasthmatics (1.31), zopiclone (sleep medicine) (1.42), cocaine (1.66), and opiates (1.91). The study concluded: \\"By and large, the increase in the risk of accident involvement associated with the use of drugs must be regarded as modest...Compared to the huge increase in accident risk associated with alcohol, as well as the high accident rate among young drivers, the increases in risk associated with the use of drugs are surprisingly small.\\" A report from the University of Colorado, Montana State University, and the University of Oregon found that on average, states that have legalized medical cannabis had a decrease in traffic-related fatalities by 8‚Äì11%. The researchers hypothesized \\"it‚Äôs just safer to drive under the influence of marijuana than it is drunk....Drunk drivers take more risk, they tend to go faster. They don‚Äôt realize how impaired they are. People who are under the influence of marijuana drive slower, they don‚Äôt take as many risks\\". Another consideration, they added, was the fact that users of marijuana tend not to go out as much. On the other hand, a recent study of Journal of Transport & Health indicated that the numbers of fatal crashes involving marijuana after the recreational marijuana legalization or decriminalization have significantly increased in Colorado, Washington, and Massachusetts. Detection of impairment A major US insurance company states that \\"there are no widely accepted methods for detecting impairment from marijuana\\". The U.S. drug czar Gil Kerlikowske said in 2012, \\"I'll be dead from old age, before we know the impairment levels\\" for cannabis. A 2017 Canadian government report stated \\"science is unable to provide general guidance to drivers about how much cannabis can be consumed before it is unsafe to drive\\". Some users seem to be able to perform risk compensation by driving slower or other behaviors, and some users appear to develop a physiological tolerance, making determining a standard impairment dose difficult. A 2010 study found \\"cannabis and alcohol acutely impair several driving‚Äêrelated skills in a dose‚Äêrelated fashion, but the effects of cannabis vary more between individuals because of tolerance, differences in smoking technique, and different absorptions of THC\\". A 2014 study found \\"no correlation between degree of impairment and THCA-A blood concentration\\". Because of these findings, some safety organizations have advocated that police use behavioral impairment tests instead of metabolite testing. =False indications of driving impairment= Testing for metabolites of THC, versus the actual THC intoxicant, can result in DUID convictions of users who aren't actually impaired. According to National Institute on Drug Abuse, \\"the role played by marijuana in crashes is often unclear because it can be detected in body fluids for days or even weeks after intoxication\\". = False positives = According to a 2017 Report to Congress produced by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, many of the THC immunoassay screening tests used by law enforcement can give a false positive of THC metabolites. This is because these screenings tests \\"lack high specificity [and] are subject to cross-reactivity.\\" After this initial screening, it is typical for a more accurate, specific test to be conducted. In some areas, law enforcement uses on-site kits to collect oral fluid. (It is possible that law enforcement may be required to obtain a search warrant prior to taking this sample.) But it has not yet been shown whether these tests are accurate or reliable, and it is possible a false positive could result from environmental exposure. It is possible that prior users of chronic cannabis users can test positive for THC even months of years after they have stopped using cannabis; there is evidence that cannabis metabolites can become stored in fat tissue and then be released due to stress or weight loss. =False negatives= Fat solubility of THC also makes detection in body fluids, which are mostly water, problematic, leading to false indication of non-impairment for users. Legal standards In May 2016, the American Automobile Association (AAA) Foundation for Traffic Safety conducted an extensive study concluding that, \\"a quantitative threshold for per se laws for THC following cannabis use cannot be scientifically supported.\\" Another study has stated that ‚Äú[z]ero-limit DUID laws for cannabis based on analysis of carboxy-THC in blood or urine lack scientific support and cannot be defended.\\" Despite these issues, some jurisdictions have adopted urine or blood metabolite per se or even zero tolerance standards. =Europe= Germany's blood serum (not whole blood like most standards) THC-A limit is 1 ng/mL. =Americas= In Uruguay, the first nation to legalize cannabis, \\"any THC detectable in the body will deem a motorist impaired to drive\\". Reporting has indicated that blood tests would be utilized. Canadian draft regulations proposed in 2017 (Bill C-46) had summary conviction offences starting at 2 nanograms per milliliter. United States Some legal scholarship has argued that per se cannabis-DUID laws violate the Due Process Clause under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution because they \\"subject drivers to criminal prosecutions without any real culpability.\\"Eric M. Langton, Regulating Cannabis-Using Drivers: Why Per Se Laws Are Scientifically Invalid, 34 W. Mich. U.T.M. Cooley L. Rev. 367, 400 (2018) = Federal = At the federal level, the United States Department of Transportation regulates public transportation (e.g. pilots, bus drivers, and train operators) and commercial truckers. 49 CFR Part 199 and 49 CFR Part 40 set maximum urine concentration levels of THC-A as the threshold for impairment for regulated transportation occupations. As of January 1, 2018, the THC-A testing cutoffs were 50 ng/mL for an initial immunoassay test and 15 ng/mL for a confirmatory gas chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry test.What are the cutoff concentrations for drug tests? (DOT Rule 49 CFR Part 40 Section 40.87), DOT website, January 1, 2018 = State = All fifty states criminalize driving while under the influence of drugs. These state laws fall into three categories: (1) \\"zero tolerance\\" laws, which criminalizes driving with any amount of THC and/or its metabolites in the body; (2) \\"per se\\" laws, which criminalize driving with a certain level of THC in the body; (3) laws that focus on whether the driver was actually impaired or affected by THC; and (4) \\"permissible inference\\" laws, which allow an inference of impairment if the THC blood level is at least 5ng/ml. Arizona Arizona Revised Statute ¬ß 28-1381(A)(3) makes it illegal to drive or be in actual physical control of a vehicle while there is cannabis or its metabolite in the body. The statute was challenged as violating the equal protection clauses of the federal and Arizona constitutions in State v. Hammonds,State v. Hammonds, 968 P.2d 601 (1998) but the Court of Appeals of Arizona upheld the statute on the grounds that the \\"presence of an inactive and nonimpairing metabolite of an illicit drug in a driver's urine does not necessarily mean that there is no active component of that drug present in the driver's blood.\\" In a law review article, attorney Joshua Snow argues that the court's reasoning is flawed because \\"there is no way of knowing when, how, or where the metabolite entered the body,\\"; thus, \\"the state cannot prove that an individual was operating a motor vehicle with the active controlled substance in the body.\\" Medical marijuana patients are not subject to prosecution under ¬ß 28-1381(A)(3) unless actual impairment can be shown.Jeremy C. Brehmer, et. al., Measuring Nothing: The Unreliable Measurement of THC in Drivers Is Bad News for the Justice System, Utilizing Forensic Science in Criminal Cases, 2014 Edition, Aspatore (November 2013) 2013 WL 5757944 ‚Äì WestLaw In 2010, Arizona passed the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act, ¬ß 36-2802, which provides that a \\"registered qualifying patient shall not be considered to be under the influence of marijuana solely because of the presence of metabolites of components of marijuana that appear in insufficient concentration to cause impairment.\\" In State ex rel. Montgomery v. Harris (2013),State ex rel. Montgomery v. Harris, 346 P.3d 984 (2014) the Supreme Court of Arizona held that ¬ß 28-1381 applies only to metabolites capable of causing impairment. In this case, the defendant's blood tested positive for Carboxy-THC, a non-impairing metabolite of cannabis.  California  California Vehicle Code ¬ß23152(f) makes it unlawful for a person under the influence of any drug to drive a vehicle. For a person to be convicted under this statute, the drug or drugs \\"must have so far affected the nervous system, the brain, or muscles as to impair to an appreciable degree the ability to operate a vehicle in a manner like that of an ordinarily prudent and cautious person in full possession of his faculties.\\"People v. Torres, 173 Cal. App. 4th 977 (2009) In People v. Torres, the defendant's urine tested positive for methamphetamine, and there was expert testimony that established that methamphetamine could impair a person's \\"judgment, focus, and psychomotor skills\\" so as to make driving unsafe; however, there was no evidence that the defendant's methamphetamine use actually impaired his driving ability the night he was arrested. Thus, the California Court of Appeal held there was insufficient evidence to support the defendant's conviction.  Colorado  Colorado has a \\"permissive inference\\" DUI law; Colorado statute ¬ß 42-4-1301(6)(a)(IV) provides that if \\"the driver's blood contained five nanograms or more of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol per mililiter in whole blood, as shown by analysis of defendant's blood, such fact gives rise to a permissible inference that the defendant was under the influence of one or more drugs.\\"  Delaware  Delaware Statute ¬ß 4177(a)(2) makes it a crime to drive under the influence of any drug. ¬ß4177(a)(6) makes it a crime to drive when the blood contains, within 4 hours of driving \\"any amount of an illicit or recreational drug that is the result of the unlawful use or consumption of such illicit or recreational drug or any amount of a substance or compound that is the result of the unlawful use or consumption of an illicit or recreational drug prior to or during driving.\\" Subsection 3(a) of ¬ß4177 provides that no person shall be convicted under (a)(6) when they did not ingest the drug prior to or during driving but only after they ceased driving--and only that post-driving ingestion caused their blood to contain the drug. Subsection 3(b) provides that no person shall be convicted under (a)(6) when they \\"consumed the drug or drugs detected according to the directions and terms of a lawfully obtained prescription for such drug or drugs; however, nothing in 3(a) or 3(b) prevent a driver from being prosecuted under ¬ß 4177(a)(2).  Georgia  Georgia Statute ¬ß 40-6-391 makes it to drive while there is \\"any amount of marijuana . . . present in the person's blood or urine, or both, including the metabolites and derivatives of each or both . . . .\\" Subsection (b) of the statute provides that being legally entitled to use a drug is not a defense to the statute if the person is still \\"rendered incapable of driving safely as a result\\" of using that drug.  Illinois  Illinois Vehicle Code 625 ¬ß 5/11-501 makes it a crime to drive or be in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of any drug \\"to a degree that renders the person incapable of safely driving,\\" (subsection (a)(3)) or while \\"there is any amount of a drug, substance, or compound in the person's breath, blood, other bodily substance, or urine resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substance Act...\\" (subsection (a)(6)). 11-501(a)(6) creates a strict liability offense (meaning the State does not need to prove anything regarding mental state)--but it does not create criminal liability for a person who ingests cannabis inadvertently or unknowingly.People v. Gassman, 622 N.E.2d 845 (1993) In People v. Gassman, 622 N.E.2d 845, appeal denied 642 N.E.2d 1291, defendant argued that 11-501(a)(6) violated due process and the equal protection clause, but the Appellate Court of Illinois, Second District, rejected his arguments. In People v. McPeak, a police officer smelled cannabis around defendant, found drug paraphernalia in his car, and defendant admitted to smoking \\"two hits\\" of cannabis one hour prior. But the Appellate Court of Illinois, Second District, found that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction because there was no evidence that consuming that amount of cannabis would result in cannabis being left in his breath, blood, or urine one hour later, there was no evidence of odor of cannabis on his breath, and there was no evidence that defendant was impaired.People v. McPeak, 927 N.E.2d 314 (2010)  Indiana  Indiana Statute 9-30-5-1 makes it a crime to drive with cannabis or its metabolite in the body.  Iowa  Iowa Code section 321J.2(1)(c) criminalizes the operation of a motor vehicle while \\"any amount of a controlled substance is present\\" in the driver's blood or urine. In State v. Comried,State v. Comried, 693 N.W.2d 773 (Iowa 2005) the Iowa Supreme Court interpreted this statutory language to mean \\"any amount greater than zero\\"-- even if that amount is nonimpairing. In State v. Childs,State v. Childs, 888 N.W.2d 177 (Iowa 2017) the defendant argued that Comried should be overruled because it relied on an Arizona decisionState v. Phillips, 873 P.2d 706 (Ct. App.1994) that had since been overruled by State ex rel. Montgomery v. Harris, 322 P.3d 160 (2014), which held that the presence of a non-impairing metabolite of cannabis is not sufficient for a DUI conviction. The Iowa Supreme Court, however, declined to adopt the Harris rule and instead reaffirmed Comried.State v. Childs, 888 N.W.2d 177, 182 (Iowa 2017)  Michigan  Section 257.625 of the Michigan Vehicle Code criminalizes driving a motor vehicle with \\"any amount of a controlled substance listed in schedule 1 under section 7212 of the public health code.\\" (Cannabis is listed as a controlled substance.) In People v. Koon, 832 N.W.2d 724, the Supreme Court of Michigan held that drivers who possess a valid Michigan Medical Marijuana Act card are not subject to prosecution under ¬ß 257.625 unless the state can show they were \\"under the influence\\" while driving.People v.

Suber, 2008 WL 942622.State v. Suber, No. A06-2438, 2008 WL 942622, at *4 (Minn. Ct. App. Apr. 8, 2008) In Suber, the Court of Appeals of Minnesota overturned the defendant's conviction, finding lack of sufficient evidence. The defendant admitted he had consumed cannabis about 17 hours before his arrest; police testified that defendant performed poorly on field sobriety tests; police testified that defendant's eyes appeared red and watery; and defendant's urine tested positive for cannabis. But the court still held that this evidence was not sufficient because the state's drug recognition expert testified that cannabis could bed detectable in urinalysis for seven to ten days after ingestion, the state did not have any direct proof that the defendant ingested cannabis in the hours leading up to him driving, and there was evidence to support defendant's story of innocence: that his eyes were red and watery due to lack of sleep, and that his performance on field sobriety tests was affected by the fact that he had Asperger's syndrome.

Kahn, 610 N.Y.S.2d 701 (1994) But there is a qualification to this test where the ingested drug is cannabis: there must be a showing of substantial impairment. In People v. Shakemma, a police officer's observation of defendant's car swerving off of the road and onto the road shoulder by half a car width, of the smell of cannabis on her car, and of her red eyes and pinpoint pupils, did not rise to the level of showing substantial impairment.

It is set in Tamaulipas, Mexico, the state with the highest number of missing persons reported in the nation. Commissioned by Sandra Mu√±oz to create a work that speaks out against the violence and death being caused by the drug war in Mexico, author Sara Uribe compiles newspaper articles, firsthand accounts, lines of poetry, and the ancient Greek myth of Antigone to represent the searches that many family members undergo for missing relatives.  Synopsis  Ant√≠gona Gonz√°lez, a young woman living in Tamaulipas, Mexico, discovers her brother Tadeo has disappeared, likely victim to the drug war going on in the country. She refers to herself and others in her situation as the ‚ÄúAntigones‚Äù of Mexico. Like Antigone of the Greek play, they are all in a desperate search to recover their lost loved ones. Following Tadeo's abrupt disappearance, a distraught Ant√≠gona turns to her family for help in the search to find her brother. Instead, her family tells her not to go to the authorities or try to learn any information regarding his disappearance due to the threat posed by the narcos. Desperate, Ant√≠gona becomes of one of the many \\"Antigones\\" across Mexico, people who are continually searching, travelling, and seeking justice for Polynices: their missing loved one. Ant√≠gona Gonz√°lez's story about Tadeo is punctuated by accounts of other \\"Antigones,\\" based on real disappearances in Mexico. The stories are of varying lengths, some of which are only a line or two long, and either detail a relative's efforts to recover a missing person or describe yet another dead Polynices found in Mexico from a newspaper article Ant√≠gona has flashbacks, mourning Tadeo by recalling their childhood together. She resolves that her brother is dead by reasoning that somehow, if Tadeo were alive, he would have made some attempt to cease her mourning by contacting her. As time passes, Ant√≠gona is more uncertain of the circumstances surrounding Tadeo's disappearance and becomes obsessed with the possibilities of what may have happened to him. Ant√≠gona's search for her brother's body leads her to San Fernando, where a mass grave containing 196 bodies likely killed by narcos was discovered. There, she joins a line of other \\"Antigones\\" waiting to view a book containing pictures of the dead in search for their loved ones. The book ends with a series of poignant questions from the poem ‚ÄúDeath‚Äù by Harold Pinter, the answers to which are testimonies by victims and family members of the disappeared. The last question posed in the text is, ‚ÄúWill you join me in taking up the body?‚Äù, a somber question that both Ant√≠gona Gonz√°lez and the Greek play Antigone encompass.  Style  Ant√≠gona Gonz√°lez is a book of prose that can be read as a lyric essay or a collection of individual poems. The book is divided into three sections, each including a title that alludes to the contents of the chapter. Ant√≠gona Gonz√°lez has a disjointed narrative, with firsthand accounts from victims of the violence in Mexico and excerpts from plays and books punctuating Ant√≠gona's story. The majority of Uribe's sources come from different Latin American variations on the Antigone story, which liken Antigone's struggle to those who have missing or dead loved ones in modern-day Latin America. The compilation of various sources are essential to the informative style of the book; reading excerpts from Ant√≠gona Furiosa by Griselda Gambaro, Ant√≠gona V√©lez by Leopoldo Marechal, La tumba de Ant√≠gona by Mar√≠a Zambrano, and Antigone's Claim by Judith Butler within the story of Ant√≠gona Gonz√°lez create a well-rounded perspective for the reader. The sources are incorporated in various ways to create a sense that the book is not about one specific character's journey, but represents a whole group of people. By doing so, Uribe creates a lyrical, journalistic text with a profound and political message that speaks out against the disregarded violence happening in Mexico. Uribe uses another element of her writing ‚Äîspacing‚Äî to support the language of her book. Using placement of the text to reinforce the disjointed nature of the story, Uribe positions text at the top, bottom, and middle of the page. Large sections of dead silence created by space between passages parallels the isolation Ant√≠gona and the other ‚ÄúAntigones‚Äù experience. Additionally, Uribe emphasizes a question, quote, or line of a poem by placing it in the middle of a blank page, guaranteeing it will catch the attention of the reader. In Ant√≠gona Gonz√°lez, Uribe also emphasizes certain quotes by placing them before a series of related words. Each word in the series, separated by slashes, isolates an individual element of the quote that precedes it, creating a staccato-like and disjointed instrument of expression. Furthermore, repetition, especially repetition of the Antigone story, is a significant element of the book. For example, the repeated phrase ‚Äúwe are many,‚Äù generates a sense of defiance, indicating the strength and determination of the ‚ÄúAntigones‚Äù as it is echoed throughout the entirety of the text In the English translation of Ant√≠gona Gonz√°lez, translator John Pleucker makes the choice to incorporate the original Spanish text into the book. Including the Spanish words and mirroring them to the English text ties the translation to the original. This stylistic layout makes the readers aware of the inextricable link between Ant√≠gona Gonz√°lez and Latin America and also allows bilingual readers to compare the translated text to the original.  Use of Antigone in Ant√≠gona Gonz√°lez  Uribe utilizes a collection of Antigone stories to connect the narrative of Ant√≠gona Gonzalez to the other ‚ÄúAntigones‚Äù searching for loved ones in Latin America. The classic, Greek Antigone character is most prominently represented by the titular character of the book, Ant√≠gona. Ant√≠gona's struggle to recover the body of her brother so she can bury, grieve, and come to terms with his death is the ultimate goal of the novel. However, due to the inclusive narrative of Uribe's book, everyone who loved and is searching for a missing person also assumes the role of Antigone in Ant√≠gona Gonz√°lez. Ant√≠gona's brother, Tadeo, along with the missing and murdered people all over the country represent Polynices in this story. In Latin America, the character of Polynices is often identified with the marginalized and disappeared due to the similarities between the Greek myth and the real-life crisis that is happening in Mexico and Central America as result of the dirty war. Uribe uses a specific example of this in her text, comparing Polynices‚Äô body outside the gate of Thebes to the bodies of those found in San Fernando. The Greek character of Ismene is represented in the hesitation, fear, and pushback Ant√≠gona's community voices when she reaches out to search for Tadeo. This fear, which affects many, stems from both the neglect of a useless government and the violence that threatens and surrounds everyone in Tamaulipas and beyond. Thebes, the city in which Antigone is set, is mentioned only a handful of times in Ant√≠gona Gonzalez. Uribe states that Tamaulipas is the same as Thebes because they are both cities ‚Äúunder siege‚Äù. Creon, the oppressive king of the Greek myth, is mentioned only once in the book as a comparison to Mexico's willful neglect of deaths and disappearances. Authors have been using the Antigone story for decades as a way to criticize political neglect or violence. Uribe also uses this tactic in her book. In addition to quoting from Sophocles‚Äô original Antigone, Uribe includes excerpts from Ant√≠gona Furiosa, an Argentinian pastiche from the 1980s that uses the story of Antigone to criticize the mass disappearances under the rule of a military dictator; Ant√≠gona V√©lez, which is a radically altered interpretation of Antigone that calls for a new government in Argentina; Ant√≠gona, una tragedia latinoamericana, which conceptualizes the Latin American rewritings of Antigone; among others. Uribe's incorporation of a familiar story is essential to creating an easily understandable political commentary.

Originally published in 2012, it was translated from Portuguese to English in 2015 by David Brookshaw, and it was also a finalist for the Man Booker International Prize in 2015. The story is set in the 21st Century and inspired by real events that Couto experienced and real people with whom he interacted during his work as an environmental field officer in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique in 2008. His novel portrays the enigmatic crisis of Kulumani, a small village in Mozambique, where the women have become the prey of lions. Couto establishes the story through the perspective of Mariamar, the sister of the most recent victim, and Archangel Bullseye, a hunter hired by the government.  Plot  Confession of the Lioness begins with the funeral of Mariamar's older sister, Sil√™ncia. As she and her mother, Hanifa Assula, watch the burial, Mariamar reveals that lions have been attacking the women of their village, Kulumani, and that Sil√™ncia, was their most recent victim. The next morning, Mariamar's father, Genito Mpepe, informs Hanifa that a hunter is being sent in from Mozambique's capital, Maputo, to aid their village. In Maputo, Archangel or \\"Archie\\" Bullseye discovers that he is the hunter who has been chosen to aid Kulumani. Before he departs, he visits his brother, Roland, who was placed in a mental hospital as a child. There, Archie confesses that the true motivation for his visits is to see Luzilla, Roland's wife, with whom Archie is madly in love. Archie leaves Maputo with Gustavo Regalo, the writer chosen to record their journey. Upon arriving in the city of Pemba, the men meet the administrator of Kulumani, Florindo Makwala, and his wife, Dona Naftalinda. The four travel to Kulumani and the next day a welcome banquet is held in the Shitala, the village's traditional center. The native men are questioning the foreigners‚Äô presence in their village, when Naftalinda interrupts. She defames the village men for violently raping her maid, Tandi, during a hunting ritual and proclaims that they are the true beasts. Meanwhile, Mariamar reveals that she had fallen in love with Archie on his previous visit to Kulumani sixteen years ago. Conflicted about his return, she flees her home. While travelling down the Lundei River, she sees a lioness and believes that it is the spirit of her sister, Sil√™ncia. Shortly after, she is caught by the village's sole policeman, Maliqueto Pr√≥prio, and then her father, afraid that Mariamar will escape Kulumani with Archie, orders her to remain home during his stay. While trapped inside her home, Mariamar recalls her youth spent in the village's Christian ministry. She also ponders her loving relationship with her grandfather, the sexual abuse she suffered from her father, her love affair with Archie, and the connection she feels to the waters of the Lundei and the ocean. Archie, Gustavo, Florindo, and Genito, one of the village's most skilled trackers, embark on a hunt. Archie sees a lioness but is unable to shoot her. He does shoot a hyena that was carrying the femur of Tandi, the lions‚Äô latest victim. After Tandi's funeral, Luzilla visits Archie, and together the two depart for Kulumani's district capital, Palma. Naftalinda plans to sacrifice herself to the lions, and Florindo begs Mariamar, who was a childhood companion of Naftalinda's, to reason with her. Mariamar convinces Naftalinda to abandon her plan, but when the two women exit Florindo's residence, Naftalinda is attacked by a lioness. Mariamar wrestles with the animal until it retreats. This leads the surrounding crowd to believe that Mariamar herself is a lioness, and the entire village jeers for her execution. However, Naftalinda and Florindo defend Mariamar. After the incident, Mariamar returns home despondently, feeling inhuman and as though she is merely an animal trapped inside the body of a woman. She then goes to lay by the dead body of the lioness. Concurrently, Archie has returned to Kulumani with Florindo who informed him that the lions attacking the town had been killed and that Genito died while slaying the lioness. Archie has been instructed by Naftalinda to bring Mariamar to Maputo with him so that she can be treated at a mental hospital. He visits Hanifa to offer her his condolences, and he then leaves with Mariamar, for Maputo, where his love Luzilla awaits his return. Before they depart, Hanifa tells Archie that there were three lions, and she is the one lioness that remains.  Major characters  = Mariamar Mpepe = Mariamar is the thirty-two-year-old daughter of Hanifa Assula and Genito Mpepe. She is the only survivor of four sisters. Mariamar and her sister Silencia suffered from the sexual abuse of their father in childhood, and Mariamar was paralyzed from the waist down. She was sent to a correctional missionary, where she meets Dona Naftalinda, then known as Oceanita. She regained the ability to walk but is still believed to be infertile, and infertile women in her village are debased even lower than normal women. She claims to have been the one who called the hunters to Kulumani, much to her father's chagrin. He and her mother shut Mariamar away during the outsiders' visit to prevent her from leaving the village, but she longs to see the man who once saved her, idealizing him as her chance to run away from the absolute power of the abusive men, culture, and society of Kulumani. = Archangel Bullseye = Archangel Bullseye is the mulatto hunter who is hired by the government to kill the lions attacking Kulumani. He had visited the village sixteen year prior, and during his stay, he had saved a young Mariamar from being raped by the village police officer. After Mariamar fell in love with him, he deserted her. When Archie returns to Kulumani, he is received with suspicion by the village's inhabitants. He no longer remembers Mariamar but instead loses sleep over different memories. He is haunted by the death of his parents, one of whom was shot by his brother, Roland, when the two were merely children. Archie is ultimately ineffective in hunting the lions. His failure can be attributed to the distraction of his love for his brother's wife, Luzilia, or it can be seen as an effect of the mysterious events he witnesses, which prompt him to question whether the lions are the danger from which Kulumani needs rescued. = Hanifa Assula = Hanifa Assula is the mother of Mariamar, Sil√™ncia, and two other unnamed daughters who drowned at a young age. Mariamar often describes her mother as tender but harsh. Despite the abuse of her husband, Genito, she obeys his will, takes care of his home, and calls him n‚Äôtwangu, a title of respect that all women in Kulumani use to refer to their husbands. While Hanifa appears to be a living person, she describes herself and other women as dead, inhuman, or nonexistent. There are many dark elements to her character which imply that she belongs not only to this world but to the world of spirits. = Genito Mpepe = Genito Mpepe is the husband of Hanifa Assula and the Father of their four daughters. He comes from a family that was favored by the Portuguese colonists. Following in the footsteps of his father, he became a tracker. He is referred to as ‚Äúcomrade,‚Äù by Florindo and the village policeman, and Florindo even invites him to serve as the tracker for Archangel Bullseye's hunt. However, within his home, Genito is an abusive drunkard who raped both Silencia and Mariamar when the two were children. = Dona Naftalinda = Dona Naftalinda is the first lady of Kulumani, who is married to Florindo. Archie describes her as majestic but vastly overweight. She possesses a strong female personality, which inspires strength within Mariamar. As a child, she lived at the same missionary as Mariamar, where she was known as Oceanita. = Florindo Makwala = Florindo serves as the administrator to Kulumani, who accompanies Archie on his journey to Kulumani and on a lion hunt. He is depicted as pompous by Archie who notes how he insists that his home be termed a residence instead of a house. Throughout the majority of the novel, Florindo is disliked by many villagers and even his wife, and his main concern is the effects that the lion attacks have on his political career. However, at the end of the novel, his relationship with his wife is restored. He joins her in defending Mariamar from the imminent danger of a raucous crowd of villagers, and Naftalinda remarks that he has once again become the man that she married. = Gustavo Regalo = Gustavo Regalo is a famous writer who has been chosen to accompany Archie on his journey and record the details of the expedition. Archie describes Regalo as self-satisfied, and his accusatory nature reminds him of his brother, Roland. Yet, by the end of the story, the two develop an understanding of one another and become friends. Regalo's character can be seen as Couto's way of light-heartedly mocking himself. Both are white, glasses-wearing writers, who chronicle lion-hunts in Mozambique.  Historical context  Confession of the Lioness takes place shorty after the end of the Mozambican Civil War. Although Kulumani is not an actual Mozambican location, Couto uses this imaginary village to demonstrate the devastating effects that almost three decades of war had on the country's villages. =Independence from Portugal = Mozambique fought against Portugal for approximately ten years, starting in 1964. Led by the Mozambique Liberation Front, otherwise known as FRELIMO (Frente de Liberta√ß√£o de Mo√ßambique), the Mozambican forces abandoned peaceful negotiations and adopted guerrilla warfare. After a ceasefire in 1974, Mozambique gained independence in 1975 under the Head of State, Samora Machel. = Civil War = In the wake of Mozambique's independence, many Portuguese colonials fled the area, resulting in a collapse of the country's economy and class system. Mozambique then became a socialist country under its newfound leaders. With nationalism running rampant, most of the four hundred thousand white Portuguese Mozambicans were forced out of the country, and white minorities in surrounding countries also suffered. Members of FRELIMO, who disagreed with the group's stringent socialist policies and persecution of those who benefited from Portuguese colonialism, formed the Mozambican National Resistance, RENAMO (Resist√™ncia Nacional Mo√ßambicana), with the support of Rhodesia and South Africa. The group began its attacks on FRELIMO in 1976, and their tactics were marked by massacre and mandated conscription of civilians. It was not until the late 1980s that the militant fighting ceased with a stalemate. By 1989, the resources of both sides were severely depleted, and as a result, formal peace talks began. Violence between FRELIMO and RENAMO continued, but in 1992, the two groups were able to negotiate a permanent ceasefire. = Kulumani = During the Mozambican Civil War, villages like Kulumani were consolidated and militarized, and after the fighting ceased, fragmentation and conflict between tradition and modernity remained, as they do in the fictional region that Couto creates. He illustrates how the preceding Mozambican conflicts of the post-colonial era have spawned further tension between the tribal, Christian, and Islamic belief systems that exist in the region. Although it is not explicitly stated in the novel, Florindo, the administrator to Kulumani, can be seen as a member of FRELIMO, while the tribal men who lead violent hunting rituals and are responsible for the rape of Naftalinda's maid, Tandi, can be seen as adherents of RENAMO.  Themes  = Female oppression = Couto denounces the patriarchy through the depictions of female oppression that pervade the novel. He develops this theme through the actions and declarations of its three major female characters, Hanifa, Naftalinda, and Mariamar. All three women are both oppressed by men and rebel against that oppression in different ways. For example, Mariamar is demeaned for being infertile and submits to the will of her abusive father. Also, as a child, she was sent to a missionary for the paralysis in her legs, a sickness that can be interpreted as a representation of the powerlessness of women. However, as the narrative develops, her strength is inspired by that of Naftalinda and Hanifa, and by the end, she has become a type of prophet for the women of Kulumani, who speaks of a world that will succumb to disaster without the presence of females. Like Mariamar, Hanifa submits to the abuse of Genito, but despite this submission, the story closes with her cry of redemption and vengeance, as she tells Archie that although it may seem that all the lions have been killed, she, the last lioness, remains living. Throughout the action of the novel, Naftalinda emanates feminine strength by decrying, in the presence of men, the subjugation and violence that the women of Kulumani face. Nevertheless, her childhood illustrates the oppression of women as she was demeaned for the large size of her body and even sent to a missionary to be healed of it. Couto further establishes the theme of female oppression through the lionesses that attack the village. These attacks can be seen as an imitation of the violence that the men of Kulumani inflict upon the women, or they can be viewed as an imitation of the suppressed rage of the women of Kulumani. Additionally, the lion attacks can be interpreted as a means of freedom for the women of Kulumani. By dying in the claws of lions, they are freed from the powerlessness and fear that pervades their lives due to the oppression of men. = Humanity vs. animality = Although the threat to Kulumani seems to at first be physical lions, as the novel develops, it appears that the actual threat to the village may be the violence of the men within it. The initial confusion of whether man or beast is tormenting the village creates a theme of Humanity vs. Animality. Couto further blurs the distinction between the two natures through the language of the novel itself, often describing the actions of the human characters in the same way that one would describe the movements of a serpent or wild cat. This theme is further established by the magical elements of the story. The lionesses have been interpreted as spiritual, physical, and metaphorical. It is speculated that the lionesses do not consume their female victims, but rather the female victims become the lionesses. Through this transformation, the anger at the victim's oppression, which they have had to hide during their lifetimes, is made manifest through the violence of the lionesses. Female oppression is the central theme of the work to which all other themes and motifs relate. As a result, the similarities between man and beast are also depicted through inhumane treatment of women. The women of Kulumani are rendered beasts by the labors of their everyday work and by the abuse of men. For example, one of the story's most prominent oppressors, Genito Mpepe, threatens to tie his wife up like an animal if she does not submit to his will. In addition, the female characters themselves acknowledge their inhumanity. This is exemplified through the scene of the novel where Archie catches a glimpse of Mariamar and asks who she is, and Hanifa Assula responds that it was no one. Archie replies that he is certain he saw woman, but Hanifa repeats her original response. The theme of humanity vs. animality not only reinforces the oppression of women, but also highlights the consequences of brutal war, as the violence of Kulumani's past war is viewed as the cause of the fading separation between human and beast. Although the lion attacks in Kulumani are most commonly related to female oppression by critics, they have also been interpreted as symbolic of the repercussions of the violence that men inflict upon each other in war.  Critical reception  Although the English translation of Confession of the Lioness was a finalist for the Man Booker International Prize in 2015 and received largely positive reviews from critics, many disliked Couto's use of language. Critics from Publisher‚Äôs weekly, The Quarterly Conversation, and The Financial Times write that his language is overly poetic, confusing, and often distracts from the plot. Critic Geoff Wisner from The Quarterly Conversation adds that Brookshaw should not be blamed for the cumbersome language, as he marvelously translated previous works by Couto. In contrast, other critics remark that Couto's lyrical language is one of the novel's stronger elements. Critic, Ellah Alfrey from The Guardian praises Brookshaw for his ability to maintain the ‚Äúmusic of the original.‚Äù Some critics even comment that the at times the plot is confusing and actually distracts from the novel's enchanting language. In spite of the prior criticisms, Couto is commonly acclaimed for the haunting yet captivating tale he constructs in Confession of the Lioness. The work also receives praise for its presentation of enriching themes and exploration of issues in post-colonial Africa. Critics from The Financial Times, World Literature Today , and The Guardian all laud Couto's ability to defame the treatment of women subtly and in a way that is not exhaustive or overly moralizing.

It was originally published as L'Invention de Nos Vies by Editions Grasset & Fasquelle on August 21, 2013, and was later translated to English by Sam Taylor on December 1, 2015. It is an international best seller and a finalist for the Prix Goncourt. The book consists of four parts and has a total of 76 chapters. The audio book is read by George Newbern.  Plot  On his eighteenth birthday, Samuel Baron finds out he is not who he thought he was. He is shocked to find that the people who raised him are not his real parents and that his real name is a variation of Christ's, a big surprise with his Jewish upbringing. This is a source of great emotional turmoil for Samuel. In his anger, he leaves his parents to attend college in France, where he meets his girlfriend Nina, a beautiful girl born to a broken military family. While at college, he and Nina meet the ambitious, seductive Sam Tahar‚Äînot to be confused with Samuel Baron. Suddenly, Samuel's parents are killed in a car accident. Before leaving to repatriate his them, Samuel tells Sam to look after Nina. After an exam, Nina comes to Sam in tears. Betraying Samuel's trust, Sam and Nina sleep together. Samuel returns and never learns of the incident, but things aren't the same between them. At the end of the school year, Samuel senses their relationship and gives Nina an ultimatum: him or Sam. Samuel, feeling that it is over between him and Nina, tries to commit suicide as a desperate last attempt to keep her. Nina, moved by this final act, stays with him. Years later, Sam has become one of America's top lawyers and is married to one of the most prestigious families in New York. Samuel and Nina, however, are living among the lower-class. They see Sam on TV, and Samuel pushes Nina to contact him. He is afraid that if Nina could do it over again, she would choose Sam. Nina and Sam rekindle their lost passion, and she leaves Samuel. Sam hides his affair with Nina. But as it turns out, the affair isn't the only thing Sam is hiding. When Sam's half-brother Francois appears in his office one day, his mysterious past begins to unravel. His real name is Samir Tahar. He is of Arabic descent, not Jewish descent as everyone believes. In an attempt to make his half-brother disappear, he creates a foreign bank account to support him. Unbeknownst to Samir, his brother gets involved in terrorist activities using the money Samir supplies. Late one night, Samir is arrested in his home. The United States of America is pressing charges against Samir for funding terrorist activity. His family feels betrayed, and the media spreads the truth about Samir's roots across America. Nina, unaware of his imprisonment, believes that he has lost interest in her, and she returns home to France. Once Nina leaves Samuel, he is destroyed. He begins to do drugs, and his life seems to take a turn for the worse. But in his pain, he finds inspiration to write. With his first published novel titled Consolation, Samuel skyrockets into success. But despite his success, he finds that he still isn't content. He is drained by the constant interviews and media coverage that come with the popularity of his book. Upon hearing of Samir's imprisonment, he decides to be a witness for Samir so that he can write a new book about it. But once he sees the state that Samir is in, he is unable to bring himself to it. Despite all the hurt Samir has caused him, he testifies for Samir's case and writes an article in France that helps put the people on Samir's side. After sixty-six days of brutal interrogation, Samir is released. Once Nina arrives back in France, she is shocked to find a new family in Samuel's old apartment, unaware of his newfound success. She is left to live among the homeless on the streets. When Samuel discovers this, he hires an investigator to track her down. When he finds her at a homeless women's shelter, he tries to convince her to come back. She has gained weight and stopped caring for her appearance, but she finds comfort in letting go of what she used to hold on to so dearly. She refuses to go with him. She wants to live a life of her own. The novel concludes with each character left with the effects of the life they constructed for themselves. Though they achieved what they had dreamed, they were unable to find happiness in their goals. Samir must start his life anew. His wife has filed for divorce, and many of his clients have moved companies. Samuel no longer has the girl he loved, and Nina has left the life she's always known for where she feels like she truly belongs.  Themes  = Emptiness of Attaining False Dream = The theme \\"Emptiness of Obtaining False Dream\\" is most prevalent in The Age of Reinvention's conclusion. Throughout the novel, each character is pursuing goals they believe will make them happy. Samir is pursuing a successful career. Samuel is attempting to get his work published. Nina is chasing love. At the conclusion of the novel, each finds that what they were pursuing the whole time isn't what makes them truly happy. Samir's career is destroyed when the truth of his identity is revealed. Samuel becomes a successful author, but finds that his success prevents him from writing. Nina obtains the love she wanted, but it doesn't bring her satisfaction. She ends up living in a homeless women's shelter without a companion by the end of the book, but she finds contentment there. Samir, Samuel, and Nina each discover that what they had planned for their lives is not what made them the happiest, and therefore \\"Emptiness of Obtaining False Dream\\" is one of the novels overarching themes. = Individual vs. Society = Throughout the novel, each individual character is battling against the society he or she lives in. Samir Tahar is at odds with society. In his childhood, he fights against his family's poverty by buying nice clothes secondhand from the rich kids at his school. When he becomes a lawyer in America, he finds that a prejudice exists that prevents him from getting a job. Again he must fight against society. He creates a new identity to battle this racism. Eventually, he is sued by the United States of America, and he must fight society yet again. Samuel Baron faces society as well. For a majority of the book, Samuel attempts to become an author and get his works published. His work continues to get rejected, and he lives in poverty. Eventually his work Consolation takes off, and he becomes a famous author, but his battle with society only changes. Now, he is constantly bombarded with interviews and press conferences. Because of this, he can no longer spend time doing what he loves: writing. Both Samir and Samuel must fight against society throughout the course of the novel, and thus \\"individual vs. society\\" is a prominent theme in the book. = Own Worst Enemy = Several characters in The Age of Reinvention constantly do things that are against his or her own self interest. Samir, for example, has an insatiable lust. Even though he has married one of the most affluent women of the time, he still seeks out sexual relationships with other women. This causes several conflicts within the story. One of the main characters, Nina, becomes his mistress while he is married. When some of Samir's coworkers discover this, they get into an argument with Samir. One of whom intervenes when Samir is arrested, lies to Nina, and tells her she should head back to France. Many of Samir's problems are caused by his own actions, mainly as a result of his lust: for power and for women. Samuel Baron is another character who is his own worst enemy. When Nina initially tries to leave him, he attempts to commit suicide. This initially keeps Nina with him, but it will only harm him later on. The thing that eventually causes Nina to leave his Samuel himself. He is the one who encourages Nina to contact Samir, which results in the main conflict of the story. Samuel is the source of much of his own stress and pain. = Prejudice and Racism = The Age of Reinvention's central conflict revolves around prejudice and racism. Samir Tahar is of a Muslim background, and he finds that he cannot find a job, despite being from an excellent law school. Once he changes to a Jewish-sounding name, he begins to get interviews for jobs. The rest of the novel unfolds as Samir struggles with his roots. When his roots are discovered and he is arrested for being suspect of terrorism, it causes great upheaval in his life. His wife divorces him and many clients move law firms. This topic was a source of much criticism for the novel (see Reception).  Reception  The Age of Reinvention has been met with mixed reception since the English translation released in 2015. Among positive things, the book was a finalist for the Prix Goncourt in 2013, one of the most prestigious French literary awards. Several articles liken the book to a modern-day Great Gatsby. In a review from The Washington Post, Ron Charles simply notes the Gatsby-like qualities of Samir Tahar. Heidi Warneke, however, describes the whole novel as \\"Gatsby-esque\\" with the added themes of \\"prejudice, politics, and racism.\\" Most reviews compliment the initial premise of the novel and what Tuil aimed for with her novel. Charles also notes Tuil's use of style to convey tension and hysteria in the novel. The novel was also met with much criticism. Although Charles compliments Tuil's style, some articles criticize it. Carmela Ciuraru of The New York Times describes it as a \\"synonym buffet\\" and critiques Tuil's use of footnotes. Much critique, however, goes to Karine Tuil's handling of racism within the novel. Hannah Beckerman, in a review for The Observer, criticizes the dichotomy between Jews and Muslims in The Age of Reinvention. She notes that all of the Muslims in the book get a sad ending, while all the Jewish characters end up well-off. In the journal Humaniora, Ellita Widjayanti writes about Islamophobia in The Age of Reinvention. She discusses how Tuil portrays each of the Muslim characters negatively. However other articles, discuss The Age of Reinvention as a timely novel that addresses these subjects, not as Islamophobic itself. Some articles note that though they believe the initial premise was promising, it failed to follow through. This view for Beckerman is a result of how racism is portrayed in the novel, but for Ciuraru it was due to its themes.  Style  Several articles comment on Karine Tuil's style in The Age of Reinvention. Tuil uses footnotes in the story to provide more background on characters. Each time a character has a brief interaction with a passerby, a footnote is provided explaining some additional detail or motive. For example, Samir passes a bouncer at a club. \\"Bouncer\\" has a footnote that explains this man dreamed of being a champion boxer, but instead had to settle for a job as a nightclub bouncer. This provides additional detail on different people‚Äîeven places‚Äîthroughout the novel. The reviewers also comment on how Tuil describes things. This is what Ciuraru describes as a \\"synonym buffet.\\" Tuil writes a series of synonyms separated by forward slashes. For example, Tuil writes, \\"[Samir] enters the courtroom, frightened/distraught/exhausted.\\"  References  Category:2013 French novels ","title":"The Age of Reinvention"},{"id":"56967412","text":"The 1947 World Table Tennis Championships ‚Äì Mixed Doubles was the 14th edition of the mixed doubles championship.

High quality sperms are injected into the egg for fertilization, it is an advanced version of ICSI.Intracytoplasmic morphologically selected sperm injection (IMSI) A high powered microscope is used to pick out and the best sperm cells which are then used in a traditional ICSI protocol. This allows the sperm to be examined in greater detail, including the nucleus which contains the sperm's genetic material. Use of this method has resulted in higher pregnancy and delivery rates and lower abortion rates. IMSI is a good choice for anyone who has failed IVF cycles in the past, and for couples who have a component of male infertility. History Introduced in 2001, the intracytoplasmic morphologically selected sperm injection (IMSI) procedure changed the perception of how a spermatozoon suitable for fertilization (via injection into the egg) should appear. A very high powered lens is used to see the sperm in greater detail during the selection process. The spermatozoon is selected at higher magnification; the aim of this is to improve the chance of pregnancy. The use of high magnification for morphological sperm selection prior to ICSI has been associated with higher pregnancy rates and lower miscarriage rate.  Evaluated criteria  Spermatozoa can be considered morphologically suitable for ICSI procedures when the sperm head is regular oval, symmetric and with smooth appearance. it should be 4.5-4.9 Œºm in length and 3.1-3.5 Œºm.

Plot Zoya Solanki (Sonam Kapoor Ahuja) is a junior in her love life and professional life reach an all time low when her rich dentist boyfriend (Rishi Hapawat) dumps her for being too infra dig, and her boss (Koel Purie) at the ad agency grows displeased with her inefficient work. But soon, her luck sent to Srilanka to shoot an ad film with the Indian cricket team. Zoya accidentally meets Nikhil Khoda (Dulquer Salmaan), the Indian team captain who is a staunch believer of hardwork and against his team's dependence on superstitions. When Zoya gets invited to a breakfast with the team, she reveals that she was born the day when India won its first World Cup. This makes the team believe that Zoya could be their lucky mascot. Her luck rubs off sensationally when the team wins the match in Sri Lanka. This goes against the wishes of Captain Khoda who is attracted to Zoya but is also irritated by the media for giving her the credit for their wins. Nikhil is at loggerheads with Robin (Angad Bedi), the previous captain of the Indian Cricket Team whose uncle is the President of the Board. When the Board hears about Zoya's lucky charm they decide to hire her as their Official Lucky Mascot. Nikhil is displeased with this and tells Zoya to leave immediately. An angry Zoya, goes back home. Later however, Nikhil visits her and apologizes for his actions and also expresses his true feelings for her which Zoya happily accepts. Zoya turns down the offer of the Board and pursues a relationship with Nikhil. To make Zoya return, Robin gives another Ad contract to AWB with Zoya being made the head. Zoya is extremely happy as it gives her more time with Nikhil and is a changing point in her career. Despite trying their best to keep their Relationship a secret, Robin eventually finds out about Zoya and Nikhil's affair. He warns Zoya about Nikhil's intentions claiming that Nikhil only wants Zoya for himself, so that he can be the Star Player. Initially, Zoya doesn't believe Robin but after he sends her a Video about a previous conversation Nikhil had with a reporter where Nikhil is advised by the reporter to make Zoya fall in love with him by his charms so that she would reject the offer, Zoya is left heartbroken. She confronts Nikhil who tries to tell her that Robin is using her to get to him but Zoya doesn't listen. After Nikhil offers Zoya double the amount of the original contract to stay away from his team, Zoya breaks up with him and instead takes the Board's offer to become the Lucky Mascot. Zoya Solanki becomes a sensation called \\"The Zoya Factor\\" and is hailed as the \\"Cricket Goddess\\" as Team India continues to win matches. Zoya is given more credit by the media than Nikhil and his team. Nikhil requests the Board to leave Zoya out of one match which is not very important for the team. Despite being an easy match, Robin purposely loses making everyone believe Zoya is indeed their Lucky Mascot and they cannot win without her. After being made a Goddess for an Ad shoot, Zoya comes to realise that even if Team India wins The World Cup, people would believe it is because of her rather than Nikhil's hardwork. Realising that both Robin and his Uncle have been using her to oust Nikhil from captaincy, Zoya breaks the contract and refuses to come to the Final Match between India and Sri Lanka. Zoya apologizes to Nikhil and wishes him luck for the next day. The next morning, the BCCI calls Zoya a traitor and hundreds of people gather outside her house pelting stones. The Indian Cricket Team are sure about their loss without Zoya but after Nikhil gives them a speech about how each one of them has worked hard to reach here and didn't need a Zoya Factor, they certainly do not need one now. The Team plays well and despite Robin's efforts to drown them, Team India emerges as Winners as everyone comes to believe that they do not need a Lucky Mascot for their win. Nikhil later shows up at Zoya's house claiming his love for her and they reconcile. In the epilogue, Nikhil and Zoya get married and make it a rule to never have breakfast before a Match. The Indian Cricket Team finally lets go of their superstitions and believes on working hard. Robin and his Uncle are suspended by the BCCI for foul play. Zoya finally resigns from her job and opens her own Ad Agency.

And delightfully uses India's cricket craze to deliver a thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining film\\". Priyanka Sinha Jha of CNN-News18 gave 3.5 out of 5 stating that \\"With its quirky premise, The Zoya Factor is light and frothy just as romcoms should be, and ticks against all boxes especially the prerequisite combo of a tall, dark and handsome hero and a good-looking yet na√Øve heroine.\\" Bollywood Hungama rated it 3 out of 5 commenting that \\"The Zoya Factor is a feel-good popcorn entertainer that works chiefly due to concept, treatment, humour and performances.\\" The Indian Express gave 2.5 out of 5 stars stating \\"For a rom-com which needs to be light on its feet, hitting fours and sixes as it goes along, the writing is not as supple as it should have been. Too many slog overs here\\". =Box office= The Zoya Factor opened to a slow start at the box office, with low occupancies. The film earned about 70 lakh on its opening day and 80 lakh each on the second and third day, taking its total opening weekend collection to 2.30 crore in India.

The game was released by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment on 15 June 2018 in North America and on 13 July 2018 in Europe. A macOS version of the game was released by Feral Interactive on 21 November 2018. Gameplay The gameplay is very similar to the previous Lego installments, with puzzles designed for younger players, various waves of fighting enemies and two-player cooperative gameplay. The game allows the player to control various super-heroes and villains alike from both films (including supers that have appeared in neither film but are listed in the National Supers Agency database in the special features of The Incredibles DVD release), each with their own special abilities and superpowers. For example, Mr. Incredible has super-strength and invulnerability, Elasti-Girl can shape her body in many ways, Violet can turn invisible and create force fields, Dash can run at incredible speeds, and Jack-Jack has a large variety of powers, just like in the films, such as turning into a human torch, telekinesis and teleportation, to name a few. The game also includes various characters from other Pixar films, such as Flik from A Bug's Life, Merida from Brave, Lightning McQueen from Cars and Woody from Toy Story. The open-world of the game is set in two fictional cities, Municiberg and New Urbem, which are situated very close to each other. Apart from the typical gold bricks puzzles, quests and challenges, the game adds a new feature called the Crime Wave, where the player travels to a specific area of one of the cities which is under assault from a super-villain and their minions. The player must complete all the quests given by the people in the area to complete the Crime Wave. Usually, the final quest involves defeating the super-villain. There are ten Crime Waves in total and five super-villains to defeat: three from the films (Bomb Voyage, the Underminer, and Syndrome) and two original characters, exclusive to the game (the Brainfreezer and Anchor-Man). Like other Lego titles, Lego The Incredibles allows players to create their own custom character with different powers and abilities. The game received a single downloadable content pack, \\"Parr Family Vacation\\", which adds the Parr family and Lucius in vacation clothes to the character roster. Plot The game's story closely follows the plot of both The Incredibles and Incredibles 2, though with numerous humorous deviations. The game begins with the events of the second film, which the player must complete before gaining access to that of the first film. There are also several major changes to both films' storylines, such as Mr. Incredible being aided by Frozone in fighting the first Omnidroid on the Nomanisan island (there are two Omnidroids in the boss battle), Gazerbeam surviving and helping Mr. Incredible sneak inside into the secret room, or Syndrome being simply defeated when Jack Jack's power activates and going into hiding rather than dying after being sucked into his jet's engine. Reception Lego The Incredibles received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews from critics, on Metacritic. The PlayStation 4 version received a 70 out of 100, while the Nintendo Switch version received a 65 out of 100. Push Square rated the game a 6 out of 10 stars. The game was nominated for \\"Fan Favorite Family-Friendly Multiplayer Game\\" at the Gamers' Choice Awards, for \\"Favorite Video Game\\" at the 2019 Kids' Choice Awards, and for \\"Family\\" at the 15th British Academy Games Awards.

It was originally published in 1992, and was later translated into English by Edward Gauvin and published in 2016. The surreal story follows David Sarella, a struggling dreamer in a world where dream \\"ectoplasms\\" have replaced art. The novel features surreal imagery and settings, frequent use of dramatic irony, and blatant commentary about art. The novel has been identified as a possible allegorical auto-biography for Serge Brussolo, and has also been compared to the imagination of the film Inception.  Synopsis  David's mother is a medium who produced and shaped a smokey substance called \\"ectoplasm\\" while she dreamed. Using the ectoplasm, she could form the faces of lost loved ones during her dreams in order to fake seances. David inherits this ability to form ectoplasms, though his eventually become more solid. David and his friend Hugo start stealing from a local junk merchant named Merlin, following in his thieving mother's footsteps. Eventually David and his mother are caught, and he learns to fear the guilt and consequences of theft, which manifests itself later in his dreams of heists. Later, when these bundles of seemingly living organic matter called ectoplasms became popular among the affluent for their beauty, and among the general public for their health benefits, David became an artist with an ectoplasm museum, and began selling his works. Conventional artwork is deemed base and pointless in comparison with this new trend, and priceless paintings wither away on the streets, and hordes of people buy small \\"dreams\\" to cure insomnia and illness. The book begins in the middle of a nautically themed dream, complete with pressure gauges and oceanic hallucinations. David and Nadia, his partner in crime, are attempting to rob a jewelry store using such extravagant tools as the severed hand and eye of the store owner. As David begins to lose the cohesiveness of his dream, objects begin to float, the safe starts sputtering and thumping, and the eyeball floats away. He has to jump through the front window, and is torn away before seeing that Nadia and his other companion, Jorgo the biker, get away safely. He awakens violently in his bed to find that he has produced a small ectoplasm that his museum assigned nurse, Marianne quickly whisks away. David later sneaks into the museum to see his dream ectoplasm in quarantine, where the museum scientists put it through a battery of harsh tests to verify that it will endure being on display. After angrily condemning the harsh, uninspired carelessness of the scientists, David later visits his lover, a widowed baker named Antonine, who buys his small ectoplasms, \\"trinkets,\\" to cure her insomnia. David also visits Soler Mahus, the greatest dreamer the world has ever known, whose power was drained after producing such enormous ectoplasms that filled plazas and stopped wars. Soler Mahus is left rambling and emaciated from over exertion, and he warns David that one must never block themselves from their dreams, because it poisons the world the imaginary characters live in. Marianne later finds David and tells him that due to his last dream's poor quality and durability, as well as his difficulty retrieving it, he would be put on leave and recommended for an injection that would keep him from dreaming. David rejects her offer, fearing his dream world would become poisoned and permanently inaccessible. During his medical leave, he is overcome by an incredibly strong urge to dream, and he illegally dives without medical supervision hoping to return with an ectoplasms so large and breathtaking it would dwarf even the works of Soler Mahus. David enters a very deep dream where the difficulty of his heist is great, meaning any ectoplasm produced would be priceless. He attempts to steal a large painting of living, moving characters, but he is plagued by fear. Right before the group completes the escape, a sudden storm soaks the painting, waking the characters and ruining the heist. David and Nadia flee, while Jorgo is shot and injured. Before the dramatic scene is resolved, David is dragged forcibly out of his dream by Marianne administering an adrenaline shot after finding David asleep and alone, emaciated from days without food. David awakes bedridden and with a damaged brain, and becomes Marianne's secret, illegal patient. Marianne attempts to get close to David, but his hatred for her causes him to desperately search for a way back to his dream world. Upon doing so, He finds his dream world in a state of horrible disrepair, and his role changes from thief to owner and proprietor as he begins to repair his dream town from the damage inflicted by his mental trauma. Eventually, the world begins to bloom with many plants, which causes David to assume that his physical body has died and given his dream one more burst of energy as it decays into nothingness.  Characters  * David Sarella, a medium who goes into deep dreams or \\"dives\\" in which he performs various heists, reflecting his childhood tendency of thievery. Though his skill is waning, he still strives to become a great dreamer whose ectoplasms are appreciated for their artistic value. * Nadia, David's female dream heist companion. David genuinely believes she is real, with a mind of her own, but in reality she is derived from the action novels he read as a kid, as well as his lover Antonine. * Jorgo, the third member of David's dream gang. Jorgo is a kid who works on various bikes and facilitates David and Nadia's getaway. His name and actions closely resemble David's childhood friend Hugo, who was obsessed with riding his bicycle. Hugo would carry David away after he stole from a local junk shop, providing the material for Jorgo's character in David's dreams. * Marianne, the museum prescribed nurse that cares for David while he dives. She is cold and logical, and she disdains his fanciful descriptions of his dreams, sticking with her own medical descriptions. She is quintessentially uptight. While she does help David when he becomes sick, David still despises her. * Antonine, a baker and David's lover. She is a retired boxer who bakes the only bread that David will eat. She spends all of her money and savings on small ectoplasm trinkets which help her sleep. She only sees the practical benefits of dream ectoplasms and not their artistic value. * Soler Mahus, a former department store employee until his gift as a medium became fashionable. His dream world consisted of a savanna, with him as an indomitable hunter accompanied by a local savage. He went on to become the world's most famous medium, producing works that filled large spaces and radiated healing. He stopped a war by producing the single largest ectoplasm overnight, also causing his sickness and loss of ability. His fall from success and loss of his dream world cause David to fear the same fate for himself. * David's mother, was also a medium. She used to conjure up images of people, and faked seances by using her ability to make ectoplasms that matched memorized pictures. She is the source of David's ability as a medium. Her tendency to steal encouraged David to do the same, which formed the basis for David's dreams. She smoked incessantly, and was not very sociable. * David's father, a travelling salesman that eventually stops returning after David is caught stealing and his mother defends him. * Hugo, David's childhood friend who was obsessed with riding his bicycle. He trained hard, and believed certain pills would give him superpowers. This pill obsession influences David's dreams and is revealed by his use of stability pills and powders that influence his emotions, allowing him to carry out heists.  Literary reviews and interpretation  The Deep Sea Diver's Syndrome has been praised for its imaginative plot and complex themes in a variety of reviews. While the book's weak points include flat characters and awkward development, it has been described as, \\"unapologetically compelling.\\" The novel is noted to have a strong emphasis on the role of art in society. Just as art is consumed in large volumes, David and the works of other dreamers are consumed without concern or abandon. The emphasis on the health benefits of the ectoplasms and the large market for trinkets and baubles seems to be a further critique of the consumerism found in art consumption. Further, the book could also be seen as semi-autobiographical, as a representation of Serge Brussalo searching the depths of his own mind to retrieve something that will please the masses. Critics have noted that the novel is an effective metaphor for an artist and his or her artwork. David Sarella is the misunderstood artist, whose ectoplasms are not fully appreciated for their artistic value. In this way, the novel is urging the reader to look deeper into art, and try to appreciate what the artist is communicating.

It is the first Burundian novel to be translated into English. The story is set in the fictional village of Hariho, following a young mute boy named Nyamuragi. When his attempts to find a bathroom are misunderstood as sexual advances, Nyamuragi finds himself voiceless due both to his disability and the hasty persecution of his wrongful convictions. Taking place after the events of the Burundian genocides, Baho! grapples with many sociocultural themes and arguments that deal with Burundi's recent problems with cultural identity. As a result, the novel employs many Burundian cultural elements including Kirundi proverbs. Despite its heavy involvement in Burundian culture and history, the novel does not discuss ethnical differences between characters. Baho! serves to instruct Burundi on how it can successfully grow as a culture and nation.  Biographical background  Born in 1986 near Bujumbura, Burundi, Roland Rugero was largely impacted by the violence in Burundi throughout his early life. After fleeing the country with his family on two occasions, he managed to return as an adult to pursue an education and career in writing. Since then, he has worked as both a journalist and author. Throughout his career, he has dealt with political tensions both in Burundian media and the cultural identity problems suffered by his people. As a result, he frequently utilizes in his works a need to publicize Burundian culture and political progressivism.  Summary  The story opens on the fictional Burundian village of Hariho, with the introduction of a nameless, one-eyed elderly woman. The region is experiencing a dry season, causing the plant life and the locals to struggle drastically. While the land was fruitful in the past, it is implied that the unfortunate state that it is currently in is the result of the selfishness of the Burundian people, specifically the ‚Äúwar of ‚Äò93.‚Äù As the one-eyed woman dwells upon her past, she hears a powerful scream in the distance, followed promptly by cries of rage directed at an unknown assailant. The assailant runs quickly by the woman, and it is learned that the man is the protagonist of this tale, local mute, Nyamuragi. The elderly widow joins in the chase after Nyamuragi as she struggles to comprehend the situation. As she approaches the group, she learns more details of the debacle. General distrust among the locals has recently increased with a recent string of rape incidents, leading many young girls to have heightened paranoia. Nyamuragi, hoping to spend a peaceful evening at the stream, has been drinking an excess of water and wishes to relieve himself. Seeing Kigeme alone, he attempts to approach her and use hand gestures to inquire where the best place to relieve himself might be as not to offend the young girl. Misunderstanding his intentions, the young girl screams for her life, as she is sure that she about to meet the same fate as many girls her age have met in the past few months. Nyumaragi, fearful of this misunderstanding, attempts to silence Kigeme with his hands so he can buy just a moment to explain his situation. Unintentionally, he only succeeds in escalating her fear. As aggressive and afraid townsfolk begin to appear at the stream, the mute sees no other choice but to run, hoping to buy more time to explain, but he is not fast enough, and is caught quickly. Nyamuragi, who was raised by an abusive father, developed a fear of speaking at a very young age, which gave off the appearance of muteness. This prompted his parents to endure a series of doctor visits to try and remedy their son's silence. After multiple doctors insist that there is nothing wrong with their son, one greedy and unfitting doctor proposes a ‚Äúcure‚Äù that would involve a dangerous surgery to the young boy's tongue. The surgery, combined with a dangerous combination of oils administered by the doctor, resulted in actual muteness for a young Nyamuragi, leaving him unable to speak even if he so desired. Amidst the war within the country, Nyamuragi loses his parents to bandits raiding his home. After witnessing the horrific event, Nyamuragi decides that if the world he lives in his so cruel, he is glad that he is unable to speak in it. This thought echoes in his head as he wishes otherwise during his capture. Just as the outraged community has gathered all the resources needed to hang the mute, the local police arrive on the scene to prevent the hanging from taking place. It is revealed that amongst the furious townsfolk was none other than Nyamuragi‚Äôs uncle, Jonathan, who has been siding with the crowd in order to buy their trust and prevent his nephew‚Äôs murder. The uncle, a veteran in the country‚Äôs war, witnessed a man burned alive after the man was not allowed to contest accusations of desertion. With this past experience weighing heavily upon him, he could not see another man killed before being able to defend himself, especially someone who could not speak. The story closes as the one- eyed woman ponders the state of judgement, and whether or not it is fair, in the world that she lives in.  Major themes  = Time = The brevity of the novel and Nyamuragi's swift conviction are placed amongst many flashbacks and moral lessons taught by the one-eyed woman. This fluidity of time is rooted in the Kirundi customs regarding the interrelations between the present, past, and future. In this, it is believed that the present is inexplicably linked to both what happened before it, and the effects it will have. = Hunger = Hunger plays a pivotal role in the daily lives and actions of many of the main characters. For example, Nyamuragi scorns his untimely digestion, as it led him to require a bathroom and thus fall into the terrible misunderstanding thereafter. In terms of the socioeconomic state of Burundi, hunger is used as sensory imagery to invoke the desperation of the poor villagers to survive. Working with the usage of time as a thematic device, Rugero strongly linked eating to the present, claiming that \\"hunger becomes a motor that pushes the characters of a novel to transcend time.\\" = Nature = One of the primary conflicts presented in the novel is that between man and nature. Rugero incorporates Burundian lessons that associate children with nature, establishing a pure relationship that is tainted by the actions of man. In regards to the novel's historical context, this conflict is utilized to highlight the ruin brought to Burundian culture through its violent history. The use of nature is largely used to define Nyamuragi's character. His age compared to his persecutors bring about a purer sense of innocence that is being threatened by the ruined adults. Nature is also used to define his disability, as both aspects of his being mute are brought about by very unnatural consequences. He is initially rendered speechless after the violence in Burundi results in his parents' murder, and he is physically muted by a botched treatment. In both cases, societal aspects of Burundi are held responsible for the abuse of one of nature's children. = Justice = The idea of justice in conflict is involved when Hariho suffers an increased number in local rape cases, to which the People's Court Responds with an unjust violence. Their disregard to hear Nyamuragi's testimony is magnified when his physical incapability to do so is considered. In addition to the unjust treatment of Nymauragi in terms of overlooking his disability, this trial also highlights the dangers of rape culture and a level one-sidedness that can effect such court cases.  Allegory  The primary allegory that Rugero utilizes in Baho! ties Nyamuragi to the natural spirit of Burundi that is trying to live on despite the country's past. However, due to the violence instilled in the people, simple misunderstandings are brought to nearly kill the boy. The many themes elicited in Baho! create a collection of conflicting elements that resemble the dualities that exist in current Burundian culture. As Rugero observes, Burundians are constantly striving to do better as a people, but are also quick to spite one another because of their differences. \\"Living in Burundi is to be constantly ready for a fight...\\" To Rugero, this in itself creates another duality in how the outside world views Burundi, as many observe Burundians to be entirely peace loving at face value. This message is reinforced by the work's title, which translates as a command to \\"live\\", referring to Burundi's need to move past its violence and distrust and just live peacefully into the future.  Language  Throughout the novel, many words and phrases are left in their original form in Kirundi. For example, each chapter begins with a traditional Birundian proverb, and the names and dialogue of the characters remain in Kirundi tradition. In leaving words in Kirundi, Rugero puts more emphasis in their intention. The Kirundi is used to strongly connect the characters and their actions, as well as the chapter's beginning moral and the unfolding practice of it. Such is the case in the names of the characters. Consequently, the characters' names are in traditional Kirundi, and their translations define the characters themselves. \\"Nyamuragi\\", for example, is used to define mutes by their disability.  Style  The length of the novel utilizes its themes of time to create a fast- paced plot defined by its brevity. At the same time, the novel's style also creates a duality in time, as the primary plot occurs swiftly, yet its interpretation is largely slowed due to the changing narrators and telling of backstories. Rugero acknowledges the novel's pace by joking that if a film adaptation were to be made, it would only be around fifteen minutes in length. In this, the plot takes on the structure of a traditional epic with the main protagonist being Nyamuragi. In being an epic, an aspect of parode is introduced, for Nyamuragi's call to adventure is the need to use the bathroom.  Reception  The novel received critical success, enabling its subsequent translations and features in international literary festivals including the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa. Among its reviews, Baho! was reported by Rwanda's The New Times as a \\"deeply contemplative\\" piece of African literature that contributes to an international movement of increased popularity among African cultural publications.  Translations  English edition cover art, published in 2016 by Phoneme Media Baho! was originally written in French with elements, including the title, written in Kurundi. Following its initial publication in French, the novel has undergone two major translations. In 2013, Rugero and translator Giorgio Tognola published Baho! in Italian for the Swiss-Italian literature festival, Babel. Published by Edizion Socrates, the Italian translation is sold under the translated title, Vivi! In 2015, Christopher Schaefer translated the novel into English. The project was directed by the non-profit publishing company Phoneme Media, which specializes in translating works with cross-cultural messages. Similarly, Schaefer undertook the translation in order to communicate aspects of Burundi culture to English speakers whose perceptions of Burundi would otherwise be influenced by Hollywood depictions of the similar crises suffered in Rwanda.

It was translated into English by Lola Rogers in 2016. It follows a young, misunderstood woman in the Eusistocratic Republic of Finland, seeking her missing sister, Manna, and her next fix of illegal chiles‚Äîby any means necessary. The novel's structure is unique, switching between the perspective of Vanna and another character, Jare, as well as Vanna's letters to her sister, and various definitions, acts of legislation, and other background information. The Core of the Sun won the 2017 Prometheus award for Best Novel.  Plot summary  The Eusistocratic Republic of Finland holds their citizens' health above all else, even to an extreme measure. Men and women deemed unfit (\\"minus men\\" and \\"neuterwomen\\", or \\"morlocks\\"; as opposed to the acceptable \\"mascos\\" and \\"femiwomen\\", or \\"eloi\\") are not allowed to reproduce or participate fully in society. The novel follows Vera, renamed Vanna by the government, a morlock that has been raised by her grandmother, Aulikki, as an eloi to provide her more opportunities in life. This disguised morlock combats her oppression and the pain of losing her missing sister, Mira/Manna, by ingesting illegal chile peppers that she obtains with the help of her partner, Jare. Mira, renamed Manna by the government of Finland, is a true eloi and serves as a model for Vanna's behaviors. She goes missing after marrying Harri Nissila and moving back to her childhood home of Neulap√§√§. Harri is found guilty of her murder after her hair and blood are found in the trunk of his car, but Manna's body is never found. This leaves Vanna with a sense of unrest, which leads to her chili pepper addiction. Jare, a former farmhand at Vanna and Manna's childhood home of Neulap√§√§, becomes Vanna's partner in crime after discovering her true nature. He loves Vanna, and helps her obtain the chile peppers she desires, maintain her image as an innocent eloi, and tries to help find Manna after her mysterious disappearance‚Äîputting himself in danger at every juncture. As the government begins to crack down and chile pepper suppliers run dry, Jare discovers a drug ring fronting as a religious group‚Äîthe Gaians. The Gaians consist of three members: Mirko, Valtteri, Terhi. After their business takes off, Vanna and Jare get married and move back to the farm at Neulap√§√§. The Gaians conclude that their profits would be maximized by moving their business to Neulap√§√§ to grow their own chili peppers. Although it appears the Gaians are interested in lucrative gain, their true intentions are to create a hybrid chili pepper that allows the capso to transcend their physical body, similar to shamanism. This is achieved when Vanna ingests a pepper named \\"The Core of the Sun\\". She has an out-of-body experience where she momentarily becomes one with the world. While Vanna is transcending, Jare is out making a drug deal with a man who responded to his advertisement in the paper. The man, however, pulls a fast one on Jare, physically assaults him, and steals the pepper. Jare leaves the deal in a hurry, suspecting the man was a part of the Finnish government. He rushes back to the farm and orders everyone to leave. Upon departure, the Gaians leave Neulap√§√§, and give Vanna one last dose of The Core of the Sun. The story culminates when Harri is released from prison and seeks out Jare and Vanna to exact revenge for leading the authorities to him. This happens after Vanna has already ingested her last dose of The Core of the Sun, allowing her to invade Harri's thoughts and prevail against him as well as find out where her sister is. Vanna is then able to find Manna, releasing her from her physical body to join Vanna in her mind where they become Mira and Vera, together as one.  Characters  * Vanna/Vera ‚Äì A disguised morlock and capsaicin addict, the main character * Manna/Mira ‚Äì Vanna's sister that has disappeared, a picture- perfect eloi * Jare ‚Äì Vanna's partner in crime, childhood friend, and wannabe lover; a main character * Harri ‚Äì Manna's mysterious husband * Aulikki ‚Äì Vanna and Manna's grandmother and caretaker * Mirko ‚Äì Leader of the Gaians (a chili- pepper religious sect) * Terhi ‚Äì A morlock that works with the Gaians, someone Vanna relates to * Valtteri ‚Äì Another devoted member of the Gaians, a chili- pepper expert  Influences  = Chili peppers = Although the nature of chili peppers in The Core of the Sun largely differs from how they are viewed in reality, much of the information about chili peppers found in the novel is accurate. In the Afterword of the novel, Johanna Sinisalo thanks Jukka \\"Fatalii\\" Kilpinen for enhancing her knowledge of chili peppers by extending an invitation to his farm. There, she sampled and grew an assortment of peppers. Working with chili peppers allowed Sinisalo to understand factors such as the Scoville rating which is determined by capsaicinoids. The Scoville scale measures the spiciness (heat) of the pepper. One can explore the Scoville ratings, health benefits, and growing techniques of peppers on Kilpinen's website. In The Core of the Sun Afterword, Sinisalo describes the Transcendental Capsaicinophilic Society as \\"a real, though somewhat tongue-in- cheek, group that can be found on the Internet\\". A Google search reveals a certifiable, chili-pepper cult. Under the \\"Chants and Rituals\\" tab, one can find the \\"Litany Against Pain\\" which is referenced several times throughout the novel in a prayer-like manner. Vanna recites this poem to herself as she suffers from chili pepper withdrawals: > Teach me, chile, and I shall Learn. > Teach me, chile, and I shall Escape. > Focus my eyes, chile, and I shall See. > Consume more chiles. > I feel no pain, for the chile is my teacher. > I feel no pain, for the chile takes me beyond myself. > I feel no pain, for the chile gives me sight. = Eugenics = Sinisalo incorporates informational blurbs and definitions as part of the narrative to provide background information about the setting of the Eusistocratic Republic of Finland. In one excerpt, she draws from a fictitious book called A Short History of the Domestication of Women in which Sinisalo summarizes and explains the research of Dmitry Belyayev on the domestication of foxes as a basis for the Eusistocratic Republic of Finland's domestication of women. Belyayev's experiments actually took place beginning in 1959, and involved breeding foxes with the goal of \\"recreating the evolution of wolves into dogs\\". Over several generations of foxes, Belyayev's team only allowed those that exhibited favorable reactions towards humans to reproduce. Arguably the most remarkable observation made of these experiments was how short an amount of time it took to reduce and eradicate what were considered unfavorable traits in the foxes. Another observation was the physical change between the generations, with foxes taking on certain characteristics of dogs. Sinisalo uses these observations as foundation for the laws that the Eusistocratic Republic of Finland enforces to ensure the \\"positive racial hygiene\\" of its citizens. According to the Afterword of the novel, her research into Belyayev was done through Tiina Raevaara's book Koiraksi ihmiselle (On Dogs and Humans, Teos, 2001) as well as a National Geographic article.  Feminist themes  The Core of the Sun, despite being a hybrid of several genres and portraying several different themes, can undoubtedly be labelled as a feminist novel. = Vanna vs. Manna = Manna represents society's expectations of femiwomen/elois in the Eusistocratic Republic of Finland. She, and other elois, are restricted by the government, and are forced to act, feel, look and talk a certain way. Education for elois is centered on appearance, being a good wife, and raising children. Manna's husband takes advantage of her naivet√© by confining her to their house through abuse and objectifies her by selling her into sex trafficking. Elois are already harshly oppressed, but Sinisalo takes it even further by making Manna's husband an amalgamation of the worst kinds of men. Sex trafficking and domestic abuse are issues that women may face in today's society. Vanna's character is complex in the way that she is more intelligent than the stereotypical eloi, but recognizes that success for a woman is determined by femininity. She chooses to pretend to be an eloi, avoiding the exclusion from society that obvious morlocks experience, despite resenting the expectations placed on eloi to dress and act a certain way. Because Vanna is able to recognize the constraints of gender roles and sexism, she uses her femininity to her advantage, tricking men into believing she is less intelligent and helpless, while actually being clever and self-educated. She represents women who recognize sexism and use it to their advantage. Vanna wishes nothing but happiness for her sister, but Manna is plagued by jealousy when her first crush, Jare, appears to show interest in Vanna. In contrast to Vanna, Manna is a true eloi, and believes that having all the desirable qualities eloi are expected to have will being her love and happiness. Vanna tries her best to let her sister shine, but her subtlety wins her the attention Manna wishes to have. After leaving home, Manna rushes into a marriage after to prove her superiority over Vanna. This marriage eventually leads to her demise, leaving Vanna feeling guilty for being the cause of Manna's jealousy. Vanna has only love for her sister, but the societal expectations placed on the sisters leads to a one-sided sibling rivalry. This is significant because it shows how women are pitted against each other not because of their instinctual feelings, but due to outside sources influencing the way they feel about each other. = Diction = Sinisalo uses terms to differentiate between the types of women and men, dictated by the Eusistocratic Republic of Finland. These terms are used to oppress their female citizens by confining them to two groups: elois and morlocks, neither of which allow for any kind of individuality or autonomy. While men are also split between mascos and minus-men, these definitions are not explored as deeply as the female categorizations since the female characters are the focus of the novel. Definitions such as elois and morlock are inspired by H. G. Wells The Time Machine.  Eloi  Sinisalo defines an eloi as the slang word for a \\"femiwoman\\", which refers to the \\"sub- race of females who are active on the reproductive market and are distinguished by their dedication to the overall advancement of the male sex\\". Elois are the more feminine of the two categorizations of female, and are forced to wear corsets, makeup, and are defined by their sexuality. The sole purpose of an eloi's life is to take care of and reproduce with men. Their education consists only of skills to make them the best wives possible; they learn only things that help them to cook, clean, and provide comfort for their future husbands. Elois are representative of the most sexist, traditionalist view of women: domestic, submissive, and ultra-feminine.  Morlock  In The Core of the Sun, morlocks are defined as a slang term for a \\"neuterwoman\\", which refers to the \\"sub-race of females who, owing to physical limitations (infertility, etc.), are excluded from the mating market...a disposable segment of society whose use is limited mainly to serving as a reserve labor force for routine tasks\\". This definition is very blunt in its dismissal of morlocks as disposable and serves as a clear explanation as to why Vanna has gone to so much trouble to pass as an eloi. While the definition seems to claim that morlocks are naturally sterile, Sinisalo later introduces a character named Terhi that was raised as a morlock and sterilized by the government. Terhi and morlocks in general represent an extreme characterization of women that don‚Äôt fit the ideals of femininity in society are dismissed and considered lesser than women seen as traditionally feminine.

The first project to be created by Beyond Games, the game takes place in a dystopian future where civilization has been reduced to a Mad Max-inspired landscape and players take the wheel of heavily armed and armored cars called Hi-Tech in order to compete against either computer-controlled opponents or other human players using the Lynx's ComLynx system in matches set across multiple post-apocalyptic locations. BattleWheels was conceived by Beyond Games founder Kris N. Johnson, who had the idea of developing a vehicular combat game along with his colleagues after playing several multiplayer titles on the Lynx such as Warbirds, which would later become a source of inspiration for the project alongside Steve Jackson Games' Car Wars. After the release of the platform in 1989, Kris Johnson contacted Atari Corp. in order to pitch them titles that focused on the console's multiplayer aspect. They later agreed and signed Kris' company as a licensed developer for the Lynx. BattleWheels was released to positive reception from critics, who praised the pseudo-3D visuals, sound design, gameplay and multiplayer for up to six people, although the lack of in-game music during matches was noted as a negative point. Updated conversions for both the Atari Jaguar and PC were in development but never released. Although it never received a direct sequel, Beyond Games would go on to develop Redline and Motor Mayhem for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 2 respectively, which are considered spiritual successors to the game.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. BattleWheels is a first-person vehicular combat game similar to Interstate '76 and Twisted Metal where players assume the role of warriors taking the wheel of heavily-armored automobiles in an attempt to kill other opponents at the titular sport to emerge as a winning victor of the match.BattleWheels game manual (Atari Lynx, US) There are only two modes of play to choose from at the main menu: \\"Action\\" is arcade-style mode that allows players to select a prebuilt car and battle against rivals in a successive manner across several locations. \\"Custom\\" mode, as the name implies, let the players customize their own vehicle with new parts, engine, weapons and other improvements that are bought with cash obtained after winning a match, although there is the choice of building a new car from the ground up or buy a prebuilt model before starting, among other options. Prior to starting a match in either mode, players have the option of choosing an arena to battle in and adjust multiple default settings such as the difficulty level for AI-controlled opponents, their number during single-player, number of kills to be reached, and player character. Controlling the vehicle is done with the D-pad; Up and down accelerates or decelerates the car respectively, while left and right turns its direction. The A button fires the currently selected weapon and changing between other weapons is executed by holding down Option 1 and pressing the direction where said weapon was located on the car, but holding down the button on its own toggles between weapons as well. The B button shows the map radar that displays the location of rivals on the current area and holding it down changes between multiple views by pressing the desired direction, while pressing up when holding down the button informs players how much damage the vehicle has sustained. The game also incorporates first-person shooter elements, as players can exit out of the vehicle by holding down Option 2 and their player character are still armed with two weapons for offensive or defensive purposes against opponents. While on foot, players can also hijack empty rival vehicles and collect moneybags on the arena, which is only possible when playing in \\"Custom\\" mode. However, being on foot is also risky, as the player's character can be hit by a running car, although they can be dodged by holding Option 2 and pressing any direction. The vehicle will catch fire after sustaining too much damage, leaving it unusable for the rest of the match and players must get out as a result. Pausing the game stops the battle and the pause screen displays the player's current status in the match. Up to six players can compete against each other by connecting six Atari Lynx units via the system's ComLynx port during the title screen in either single or team deathmatches. = Synopsis = The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic dystopia on the year 2019, where the world has been reduced to a Mad Max-inspired setting and humanity has now turned towards more violent sports for entertainment as a result of both technological advancements and nationwide reorganization of the political structure that led to the creation of new kinds of sports, with the titular BattleWheels being the most popular of all. This arena-based combat sport pits up to six warriors dueling each other and driving heavily-armored vehicles named Hi-Tech in order to kill the other opponents to emerge victorious.  Production  = Background = Beyond Games was established between 1991 and 1992 by Kris N. Johnson, an avid video game player and self-taught programmer who had aspirations of entering into the video game industry during the 1980s. Kris Johnson began coding with Atari BASIC on the Atari 8-bit family and slowly built an understanding in how to program games and despite reaching several companies to publish his works, none of them ever reached the market after multiple unsuccessful attempts. Kris also sent various letters to Nintendo and Sega in order to obtain a development kit for developing titles on their systems, but neither replied to his inquiries. After Atari Corporation released the Atari Lynx in 1989, he took an interest towards the system and proceeded to contact Atari Corp in order to propose them several projects that focused on the console's multiplayer capabilities, which they eventually agreed to and offered Kris a development kit for US$1000, becoming a licensed developer for the platform in the process despite his lack of professional experience in the field. Prior to his venture in video game development, however, Kris was also the owner of a nightclub during his youth along with a colleague that would later part ways with him. It also served as a mean of recruiting staff for his company, among them being future WildWorks CEO Clark Stacey and designer Tim Huntsman, both of which would later play a role during the creation of BattleWheels. = Development = Warbirds served as a source of inspiration for BattleWheels and made heavy use of the Atari Lynx hardware. At Beyond Games, Kris developed various multiplayer prototype titles for the Atari Lynx on his own during the day before bringing them along with several Lynx units for testing purposes with colleagues on his nightclub. He and his friends played various games on the platform such as Epyx's Todd's Adventures in Slime World and Atari's Warbirds, with the latter serving as a source of ideas for him due to its showcase of the console's multiplayer capabilities that would lead to the conception of BattleWheels as a result. Kris desired to develop a vehicular combat game project after obtaining a development kit for the system and Huntsman, who is also an avid tabletop player of games like Car Wars, offered his help in developing the project. Kris intended the title to be easy to play but hard to master for both casual and hardcore players, in addition to pushing the hardware as much as he could from the beginning of its development in terms of graphics and multiplayer. The programming and sound effects of BattleWheels were handled solely by Kris, while the hand-drawn graphics were created by artist Lorin Nelson and the cover art for packaging was drawn by Curt Hatch. Both Curtis Coalson and Huntsman composed the music, while the latter designed more arenas and wrote the instruction manual after joining the company. The game spent half a year being tested by Kris and his colleagues, along with a group of volunteers who were recruited via online forum posts in order to refine its gameplay before release. = Release = BattleWheels was first showcased to attendees at the Consumer Electronics Show in 1993 and planned to be released in early 1994, with Huntsman promoting the game disguised as one of the playable characters to positive reception before being released to the general public on the same year late into the life span of the Lynx, becoming the first commercially released game to be created by Beyond Games.  Reception  = Pre-release = In their June 1993 issue, GameFan gave positive remarks to the title in regards of its visuals and compared it with Warbirds. = Post-release = BattleWheels has been met with positive reception from critics since its release. Chris Bieniek wrote in VideoGames & Computer Entertainment that BattleWheels effectively combines elements from Warbirds, BattleTech Centers, and the Mad Max film series. While highly praising the scaling effects and effective implementation of the Comlynx, his review focused mainly on the numerous features and resulting depth of the gameplay, noting elements such as the use of stereo sound to clue the player in to the locations of opponents and missiles, the customizable weapons setup, and ability to obscure the windshields of opponents. He summed up that \\"Though it sounds contradictory to the theme of ... a fast-paced, violent game, Battlewheels is also a game of subtlety,\\" and gave it a 9 out of 10. While GamePros Boss Music was also impressed with the graphics and features, he felt the gameplay was too repetitive to sustain interest during the single-player mode, especially with the lack of music. He recommended gamers buy it only if they had someone else to play it with. Robert Jung reviewed the game which was published to IGN Entertainment. In his final verdict he went on to say \\"the best implementation of the \\"Car Wars\\" idea I've ever seen on any computer or video game console.\\" Giving the game 9 out of 10.  Legacy  After the release of BattleWheels on the Atari Lynx, Atari Corporation was impressed with the work of Beyond Games and Gary Tramiel invited Kris Johnson, whose company was preparing to move into another platform to develop new projects, in seeing their new upcoming home video game console that would later become the Jaguar and after Kris became intrigued by the hardware specifications during this invitation, his company was signed by Atari Corp. to be one of the first third-party developers for the console and an updated conversion of the game was intended to be one of their first titles for the platform alongside Ultra Vortek. BattleWheels for the Jaguar was repeatedly touted to be an upcoming title for the platform that was being developed by Beyond Games, with plans to be released in 1994 before being pushed back for 1995. After the completion of Ultra Vortek, Tim Huntsman stated in a 1995 interview with online magazine Atari Explorer Online at E3 1995 that BattleWheels was intended to be their next follow-up project on the Jaguar, with plans to be also released on PC and now scheduled for a Q2 1995 release. However, neither version was ever completed and released to the general public for unknown reasons, though cover art and screenshots of the PC port do exist. Despite not receiving a direct sequel, Beyond Games would later create Redline and Motor Mayhem for Windows and PlayStation 2 respectively, which are spiritual successors to the game.

After the war, he worked as a consultant for the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the Organization for Security and Operation in Europe (OSCE). Blumi completed an MA in Political Theory and Historical Studies at the New School for Social Research in New York, United States. Studying in the History, Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies departments, Blumi graduated with a Ph.D. in 2005 from New York University. His dissertation focused on the complex interactions that Ottoman authorities and inhabitants of Ottoman Albania and Yemen had with each other, with Blumi visiting regional and national archives around the world for his research while he was a Fulbright-Hayes fellow being based in Istanbul. Blumi also had a SSRC-IDRF (Social Science Research Council ‚Äì International Dissertation Field Research Fellowship) fellowship for his Ph.D research. Blumi became an assistant professor of Middle Eastern and Balkan history at Georgia State University in Atlanta, USA. During that time he was also a senior research fellow in the Centre for Area Studies at Leipzig University, Germany and a visiting professor of history at the American University of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates where his research focused on regional migration and its impact on host societies. Blumi has written more than two dozen articles. They cover topics and focus on Ottoman rule in Albania and Yemen, migration patterns of Muslims in the Balkans to Western and Central Europe, south-eastern European history and current affairs, post First World War social history in Kosovo and Albania, the Kosovo crisis, and analysing issues relating to state centralisation and identity. His research interests include Balkan history, Political Islam, the Middle East/Persian Gulf/Red Sea regions and Muslim migration. Blumi has favoured a multi-sited comparative and interdisciplinary approach toward his research that encompasses social history, post-colonial theory and analysis of state institutions as they evolved over time. His research has also entailed a transregional approach examining sociopolitical, cultural and economic exchanges, links and fragmentation in relation to collapsing political systems and the Ottoman Empire, Habsburg Empire and their transnational impacts on the Balkans and Balkan diasporas around the globe. His other areas of research interest have included modern forms of Islam as practiced in the Balkans, Middle East, Eastern Africa and South-East Asia after the Second World War and nineteenth century Asian Muslim Emirates dealing with expanding European commercial interests within the South China Sea.

Background  Like the Honda RC213V-S and Ducati Superleggera, the HP4 Race does not qualify for any race series, and was made to display the manufacturer's technological prowess rather than for Homologation. BMW claims the HP4 Race produces at 14,500 rpm, due to the higher rev limit over the normal HP4, which BMW says makes at 13,900 rpm. Most of the HP4 Race's design elements and engine are from the S1000RR, with many components re-tuned for higher performance, and adding greater adjustability, including a rake of 24.5¬∞ that can be decreased by 0.5¬∞ or increased by 1.0¬∞. It has an all-carbon fiber chassis that BMW says weights , and fairing makes extensive use of carbon fiber. It has a GP style 1-up, 2-3-4-5-6-down shifting pattern. Like the S1000RR, HP4 Races have traction control and wheelie control, and a quickshifter. Because it is for track use only, it does not have lights or mirrors.

Zarda, 590 U.S. ___ (2020), was a landmark United States Supreme Court civil rights case which ruled that under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 employees could not be discriminated against on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The case involved Donald Zarda, a skydiving instructor for Altitude Express who had told a female customer of his gay identity to make her more comfortable being attached to him during a skydive. She and her boyfriend later expressed their objections to Altitude, leading to Zarda's dismissal on the claim of misconduct. Zarda filed suit in 2014 on the basis of employment discrimination, and though Zarda died in a skydiving accident that year, his family continued the legal battle. While the District Court ruled in favor of Altitude Express in Zarda v. Altitude Express, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned, ruling that Title VII does protect employees from discrimination based on sexual orientation, adding to a circuit split. The Supreme Court accepted Altitude Express's petition and consolidated the case alongside Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, a similar case of sexual orientation discrimination from the Eleventh Circuit but which ruled that Title VII did not cover such discrimination. Oral arguments were heard on October 8, 2019 alongside the case R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission which dealt with Title VII and employment protections for transgender people. The Court ruled in a 6‚Äì3 decision for Bostock, covering all three cases, on June 15, 2020, that Title VII protections do apply to gay and transgender persons. Background In 2010, Donald Zarda was fired from his skydiving job at Altitude Express. He had told a customer he was gay to make her more comfortable with being strapped together. The woman's boyfriend later complained to the company that Zarda had inappropriately touched her, and Zarda was fired as a result. In October 2010, the press first reported that Zarda had brought his firing to court and was suing Altitude Express. Altitude Express (in Long Island, New York) claimed Zarda had been fired for alleged \\"inappropriate behavior in the workplace\\", with Zarda's lawyer arguing the customer had been homophobic and the firing was due to Zarda's sexual orientation. In the case, Altitude argued that Zarda had touched the client inappropriately, backing up the customer's claims. Zarda's family argued that he would never have done such a thing, and that the firing had been motivated by his sexual orientation. Zarda alleged he was fired for failing to conform to the \\"straight male macho stereotype\\". Zarda died on October 3, 2014, in Switzerland in a base jumping accident and the case was continued by his family. District and Appeals Court Zarda's case was initially heard in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in 2014. While the case was in progress, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued a non-binding memo in 2015 that it would treat sexual orientation as covered by Title VII; this aligned with a prior non-binding memo from the Department of Justice (DOJ) that it would also treat sexual orientation as protected under Title VII should such cases be presented to them. Despite these federal memos, the District Court summarily ruled in favor of Altitude Express. Zarda's estate appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. During this case, Donald Trump became president in 2017. Trump took steps to undo many actions previously established by the prior president Barack Obama, including instructing the DOJ to reverse its decision on Title VII protections for sexual orientation. In its new memo, the DOJ asserted that while significant cultural shifts had occurred since the passage of the Civil Rights Act, Congress had not amended the law in any way, and thus rejected that Title VII protected against sexual orientation discrimination as the DOJ had \\"substantial and unique interest\\" to follow the letter of the law. No such change was made from the EEOC's stance, putting these two agencies at odds with each other. The three-judge panel at the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court's ruling in April 2017, agreeing that sexual orientation was not covered by Title VII, but commented in the opinion that there were \\"tensions\\" around how such cases were being handled by the courts. Zarda's estate sought an en banc hearing before the full Second District court, which was granted. In July 2017, the DOJ unexpectedly interceded in the case, arguing in a friend of the court brief that Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not explicitly cover sexual-orientation discrimination in the workplace. Both the DOJ and the EEOC filed opposing amicus briefs. The DOJ explained its position to the Second Circuit. The brief argued that the law does not define \\"sex,\\" and that the common \\"ordinary\\" usage protected being biologically female or male. The American Bar Association announced that it disagreed with the DOJ's stance, arguing to protect gay rights. The DOJ argued as well that employers were free \\"to regulate employees‚Äô off-the-job sexual behavior\\" and could discriminate for promiscuity, adultery, or sexual orientation. The EEOC reiterated arguments it had \\"pioneered\\" in a case in 2015 that informed the Seventh Circuit opinion on the Hively v. Ivy Tech case in 2017. A number of opinions were published on the case. After the oral argument was made on September 26, 2017, the opinion was issued on February 26, 2018. The full court reversed the prior rulings on a 10-3 vote, and asserted that Title VII prohibits sexual orientation employment discrimination under the category of sex. The court ruled that \\"because sexual orientation is a function of sex and sex is a protected characteristic under Title VII, it follows that sexual orientation is also protected.\\" The ruling did not focus on the merits of Zarda's case specifically, but whether sexual orientation was protected as a function of sex, and in effect protected gay workers under the Civil Rights Act. In effect, the conclusion held that Zarda's estate could bring Title VII claims against Altitude Express, as the law encompassed discrimination based on sexual orientation. In the ruling, the 2nd Circuit confirmed that its conclusion was the result and continuation of the Supreme Court's 1989 prohibition on gender stereotyping in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, as well Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services in 1998 that protected both genders from discrimination. Supreme Court Prior to the en banc ruling from the Second Circuit, it had been expected for the case to be on track for the Supreme Court. Zarda's legal representative Gregory Antollino argued that \\"If you discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, you necessarily take into account the sex of the employee. You can't take the 'sex' out of \\"sexual orientation.\\" In May 2018, the Advocate reported that Altitude Express had appealed the February decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Altitude Express filed a petition for the Supreme Court to hear the case again, arguing that, according to the Advocate, that \\"expanding the law to cover discrimination based on sexual orientation should be done by legislators, not the judiciary.\\" The petition argued that sexual orientation discrimination did \\"not amount to discrimination based on gender stereotyping, which some courts have ruled is a type of sex discrimination.\\" In the February ruling, whether sexual orientation discrimination occurred in the case had not been addressed, only the legality of such discrimination. The petition also did not seek to address the merits of the Zarda case specifically, only focusing on whether Title VII applied as a valid type of discrimination. Altitude Express was represented by Saul Zabell of Zabell & Associates. In the petition, Zabell argued that the decision made by the 7th and 2nd Circuits \\"departed from more than 50 years of established precedent\\" in that it ruled on the scope of protection for LGBT employees under Title VII. To \\"resolve the circuit split,\\" the petition called for the Supreme Court to step in. There was no guarantee the court would grant the petition. Donald Zarda's estate, represented by lawyer Gregory Antollino, opposed the Supreme Court review, with Antollino stating that he thought more \\"circuits need to weigh in\\" before the Supreme Court involvement and citing other pending cases. It was noted that between the different circuits, the courts were split on the matter of sexual orientation discrimination. The Supreme Court granted cert to the petition in April 2019 under the case name Altitude Express, Inc. v Zarda (Docket #17-1623). The case was consolidated with another petition, Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia (Docket #17-1618), in which a gay employee in the county's child welfare service program was fired for his sexual orientation. In this case, the Eleventh Circuit ruled in favor of the county, that previous case law out of the Fifth Circuit allowed for dismissal of employees due to sexual orientation. The Court's granting of cert was announced alongside another related case to be heard by the court R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, related to whether Title VII protections included transgender individuals. Altitude Express, Bostock and Harris were heard during October 8, 2019 oral arguments. In oral arguments the Court's more conservative Justices argued that because Congress had not included sexual orientation at the time of the Civil Rights Act, nor had updated the law to include it since, they feared creating law outside Congress's authority. Arguments also centered on how the word \\"sex\\" in Title VII could be interpreted to include sexual orientation, and not strictly gender. = Decision = References Category:United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit cases Category:United States LGBT rights case law ","title":"Altitude Express, Inc. v.

EBR is a high-efficiency denitrification, metals, and inorganics removal technology that provides electrons directly to the EBR bioreactor as a substitute for using excess electron donors and nutrients. It was patented by INOTEC, a bioremediation company based in Salt Lake City, UT. The EBR technology is based on the principle that microbes mediate the removal of metal and inorganic contaminants through electron transfer (redox processes). In conventional bioreactors, these electrons are provided by excess organic electron donors (e.g., organic carbon sources such as methanol, glucose, etc.). They require excess nutrients/chemicals to compensate for inefficient and variable electron availability needed to adjust reactor ORP chemistry, compensate for system sensitivity (fluctuation), and to achieve more consistent constituent removal. The Electro-Biochemical Reactor directly supplies needed electrons to the reactor and microbes, using a low applied potential across the reactor cell (1-3 V) at low milli-Amp levels. As a comparison, one molecule of glucose, often used as a cost-effective electron donor, can provide up to 24 electrons under complete glucose metabolism, while a current of 1 mA provides 6.2x10^15 electrons every second. The small amount of power required can even come from a small solar/battery source. The EBR systems have been successfully demonstrated in the mining and power generation sectors to remove nitrate, nitrite, selenium, cadmium, molybdenum, nickel, tin, uranium, zinc, antimony, copper, lead, silver, vanadium, and mercury.

He received the episcopal ordination on 28 October 1685 by the apostolic nuncio in Austria, Francesco Buonvisi. The victories of Prince Eugene of Savoy against the Turks gave Trautson a peaceful term. He continued the reconstruction of churches which had been destroyed in the Turkish siege in 1683, and remodeled St. Stephen's Cathedral by commissioning new altars. He was interested in history and heraldry and had the Trautson manuscript made, in which engraved inscriptions and armorials of the Viennese churches are featured.

In contemporary use it can refer to a variety of holes or depressions found at ancient sites and referred to in literature, and has also been utilized in biological taxonomy to describe species or structures that have similar characteristics.  Historic / Archaeological Uses  A bothros at the Temple of Demeter in the Valle dei Templi near Agrigento In Greek antiquity, a bothros was an artificially-created or formed depression in the ground, which could serve various purposes. In archaeology, similar items are also referred to by this name and interpreted depending on their context as altars, locations for sacrifice or storage pits. In the works of Homer, bothros generally refers to a depression or pit in the ground. In the Odyssey, the handmaidens of Nausicaa wash their clothes in one,Homer, Odyssey 6, 92: œÉœÑŒµ·øñŒ≤ŒøŒΩ Œ¥ '·ºêŒΩ Œ≤œåŒ∏œÅŒøŒπœÉŒπ Œ∏Œø·ø∂œÇ ·ºîœÅŒπŒ¥Œ± œÄœÅŒøœÜŒ≠œÅŒøœÖœÉŒ±Œπ and at the advice of Circe Odysseus digs one for the offering of libations to the dead in the underworld - first honey and milk, then wine, then water.Homer, Odyssey 10, 517-520. They were also used to collect the blood of sacrificial animals that were killed above them, which was thought to attract the spirits of the dead.Homer, Odyssey 11, 24-50. Archaeological findings considered to be bothroi are often round or D-shaped, partially lined in a complicated form with stones, and can vary greatly in size and shape. When found within households they are generally interpreted as fireplaces, ovens or storage pits for grain and food storage. Sacrificial bothroi often contain remains of ceramics and bones or other intentionally-placed objects. Bothroi are found mainly on sites from the early Bronze Age and the Iron Age in Greece. Important sites include Korakou, Gonia and Zygouries around Corinth, at Asine and in Lerna in the Argolis, in Eutresis and Orchomenos in Boeotia,Hutchinson, R. (1935). Bothroi. The Journal of Hellenic Studies, 55(1), 1-19. doi:10.2307/626656 where so many were found that the excavator spoke of \\"bothroi levels\\". But they also occur in the Greek colonies of southern Italy, in Etruria, Dacia and Macedonia . As many of them were in use over a period of several generations, they can provide additional archaeological value, as the sequence from the recent upper findings to the older, deeper lying finds gives important clues for the relative chronology of the found objects.

Her boyfriend of nine years, Nate, breaks up with her, and she spirals into a depression. Her best friends Erin, a real estate agent afraid to admit her feelings to her girlfriend Leah, and Blair, a social media manager who needs to break up with her boyfriend Will, with whom she has lost chemistry, are the only ones who can bring her out of it. Jenny contacts Erin and Blair after learning the concert series known as Neon Classic is putting on a pop-up show at Sony Hall and proposes one last adventure together before she moves, both to celebrate a new chapter in her life and to mend her broken heart. The girls meet up by taking a day off from work. Throughout the day they find it difficult to secure tickets for the concert, eventually obtaining them through Jenny's ex-boyfriend, Matt, with whom Blair has sex. Erin and Jenny run into Leah, and Erin clearly has some unresolved issues stemming from her fear of commitment. Blair breaks up with Will after finding him at her apartment without her, and it ends amicably. The girls all go to the concert in the evening and Jenny runs into Nate, but cannot bring herself to talk to him, and gets separated from her friends. Matt takes her to the after-party where she realizes she needs closure. After a heart-to-heart where Erin admits she needs to grow up and Blair admits that she needs to lower her own expectations, they go to find Jenny at the after-party, but not before Erin meets up with Leah and they acknowledge their feelings for each other and agree to take their relationship slow.

Erin realizes that Jenny went to Washington Square Park, where her relationship with Nate began. Jenny is found sitting on the side of the fountain where nine years prior he had written their initials and a smiley face inscribed within a heart.

Blair and Erin come to find her and the three walk off together, promising that their friendship will stay strong even after Jenny leaves for San Francisco.

Premise Writing for Deadline, Nellie Andreeva describes Cursed as \\"a re-imagining of the Arthurian legend, told through the eyes of Nimue, a young heroine with a mysterious gift who is destined to become the powerful (and tragic) Lady of the Lake. After her mother's death, she finds an unexpected partner in Arthur, a young mercenary, in a quest to find Merlin and deliver an ancient sword. Over the course of her journey, Nimue will become a symbol of courage and rebellion against the terrifying Red Paladins, and their complicit King Uther.\\" In another piece on that site, Andreeva calls the show \\"a coming-of-age story whose themes are familiar to our own time: the obliteration of the natural world, religious terror, senseless war, and finding the courage to lead in the face of the impossible\\". Cast and characters =Main= * Katherine Langford as Nimue, a young Fey woman who is shunned by her village, as they believe she is \\"cursed\\". Her village is soon slaughtered by religious zealots, \\"the Red Paladins\\", but she escapes and is entrusted with the legendary Sword of Power by her mother Lenore, who tells her to get it to \\"Merlin\\" moments before Lenore's death at the hands of the Paladins. Setting out on a journey to save her people from a holy war of extinction, Nimue struggles with the corrupting power of the Sword, while coming to grips with her secret history, the powerful magical legacy that flows in her blood, and what it will mean for her and her people when she embraces her destiny as the \\"Wolf-Blood Witch\\", and eventually as the Fey Queen. * Devon Terrell as Arthur, a sellsword who becomes Nimue's main love interest and struggles to rise above the shadow of dishonour and debts left in the wake of his father's death.

Uther turns to his mother for guidance, but her political aspirations create a rift between them that forces Uther to take his own counsel. He seeks the Sword of Power, which will solidify his illegitimate claim to the Pendragon Throne. * Lily Newmark as Pym, Nimue's closest friend who escapes the destruction of their village at the start of the series.

It was of considerable importance to Dutch long distance shipping between roughly 1500 and 1800. Fort De Schans op Texel (ca.1574), historiek.net, 18 July 2017. The Rede van Texel was located off the east side of the island, near the town of Oudeschild.  Functions  At the roadstead ships from cities around the Zuiderzee safely anchored and waited for favourable sailing conditions, hired pilots and picked up provisions and sometimes parts of the crew. A lot of transloading was done at the Rede van Texel, as the shoals of the Zuiderzee prevented most ships from sailing to and from their ports fully laden. The ships anchoring at the Rede van Texel, sometimes up to 150 together, were mainly merchantmen, most notably from the Dutch East India Company, but also whalers and war ships. For the island of Texel the roadstead meant a substantial source of income. = Safety = The safety that the roadstead provided was only relative. Frequently storms would damage or sink ships, sometimes dozens in one day. Onderwaterarcheologie op de Rede van Texel, maritiem erfgoed.nl, 27 August 2015. Some 44 fully laden merchantmen were lost on Christmas Eve 1593, littering the east coast of Texel with bodies and wreckage. The Dutch merchant and poet Roemer Visscher suffered a sizeable loss that night and named his third daughter Maria Tesselschade (Texel Damage) after the disaster. In December 1660 upwards of 100 ships may have been lost in a storm at the Rede van Texel. It is estimated that a total of between 500 and 1000 ships were sunk at the roadstead. In 1574 William the Silent had a fort built near Oudeschild to protect the Rede van Texel, which must have been one of the busiest ports at the time.  Decline  In the course of the nineteenth century the Rede van Texel lost most of its purpose. Both the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War and the French occupation had already been disastrous for Dutch merchant shipping, with a decline of activity at the roadstead in its wake. This was followed by the opening of the Noordhollandsch Kanaal in 1824, bypassing Texel to some extent, and the introduction of the steamship, which didn't have to wait for favourable winds. The opening of the North Sea Canal finished what was left of the roadstead, as ships bypassed Texel altogether.  Sources  * Vos, A.D.

The city recognized the attack on Thursday, March 22, 2018, and publicly acknowledged it was a ransomware attack. Due to Atlanta's national importance as a transportation and economic hub, the attack received wide attention and was notable for both the extent and duration of the service outages caused. Many city services and programs were affected by the attack, including utility, parking, and court services. City officials were forced to complete paper forms by hand. On November 26, a grand jury indicted two Iranian hackers, Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, for the attack. The Department of Justice alleged that Savandi and Mansouri are part of the SamSam group; that the SamSam group is based out of Iran; and that the pair created SamSam Ransomware, the malware used in the attack. There are no affiliations with the government of Iran. Approach and attack Leading up to the attack, the Atlanta government was criticized for a lack of spending on upgrading its IT infrastructure, leaving multiple vulnerabilities open to attack. In fact, a January 2018 audit found 1,500 to 2,000 vulnerabilities in the city's systems, and suggested that the number of vulnerabilities had grown so large that workers grew complacent. The virus used to attack the city was the SamSam Ransomware, which differs from other ransomware in that it does not rely on phishing, but rather utilizes a brute-force attack to guess weak passwords until a match is found. It is known to target weaker IT infrastructures and servers. The ransomware has prominently been behind attacks on medical and government organizations since its discovery in 2016, with previous attacks on targets ranging from small towns such as Farmington, New Mexico to the Colorado Department of Transportation and the Erie County Medical Center. It can also bypass antivirus software. Despite no suspects being identified or indicted until November 2018, the SamSam hackers were described as \\"opportunistic\\". On March 22, at 5:40 AM, the Department of Atlanta Information Management first learned of outages on various internal and customer applications ‚Äúincluding some applications customers use to pay bills or access court related information,‚Äù according to Richard Cox, the city's interim Chief of Operations. Soon afterward, the city shut down many of its digital services in an attempt to control the situation, including its court system database and the wi-fi at Hartsfield‚ÄìJackson Atlanta International Airport. The city eventually identified it as a ransomware attack. Aftermath and recovery efforts This hack was notable as it was the largest successful breach of security for a major American city by ransomware, potentially affecting up to 6 million people. Following the attack, the city of Atlanta cooperated with the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and Secret Service and hired security firms such as SecureWorks to investigate, and many government computers were advised to stay powered off until 5 days later. Though the city declared that there was little to no evidence that personal data had been compromised, later studies show that the breach was worse than originally estimated. In June 2018, it was estimated that a third of the software programs used by the city remained offline or partially disabled. In addition, many legal documents and police dashcam video files were permanently deleted, though the police department was able to restore access to all its investigation files. For a while, residents were forced to pay their bills and forms by paper. In response to this hack, Atlanta devoted $2.7 million to contractors in order to recover, but later estimated it would need $9.5 million. On November 26, 2018, the Department of Justice indicted two Iranian hackers for the attack, charging that Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri were part of the SamSam group and created SamSam Ransomware.

She was also the first female to join the faculty of the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary in 1955 at Takoma Park, Maryland and later when the Seminary relocated to the campus of Andrews University. The Seventh-day Adventist church does not ordain female clergy and Running began her academic career at a time when few women were accepted in a professional capacity within the Seventh-day Adventist church. Seminary leadership were also skeptical regarding their male students willingness to be taught by a female academic, and of Running's ability to relate to male students. She was initially hired on a probationary basis, but within a year was given faculty status and not long after, full tenure. During her tenure at the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary (1955-2002) she taught Greek, Hebrew, Egyptian, Akkadian, Syriac, and Aramaic. She was also the first female president of the Chicago Society of Biblical Research from 1981 to 1982. Running also created \\"The Leona Glidden Running Collection: Women in Church and Society\\" which is a collection of published opinions and thought regarding women in the church and in society. The extensive collection contains files regarding current issues of women, including the ordination of women ministers in various denominations, women in athletic and other careers, the influence of economic conditions on women, aging, assault and abuse, rape, health, gender roles, and marriage.  Biography  Running was born on August 24, 1916, in Flint, Michigan. Her father was Charles Comstock Glidden and her mother was Leona Mary Bertha Boat Glidden. From an early age, Running was attracted to learning languages and was encouraged by her mother, who was a teacher. She completed her schooling at Adelphian Academy in Holly, Michigan. Running undertook a bachelor of arts in modern languages (French, German, and English) from Emmanuel Missionary College and graduated as valedictorian in 1937. She also completed a master of arts in Greek and Hebrew (the two primary biblical languages) from the Adventist Theological Seminary in 1955. She completed a Ph.D. in Semitic languages from Johns Hopkins University in 1964. In May 2012, Running received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Andrews University. She married Leif Running on May 17, 1942, however, he died August 20, 1946 while undergoing surgery. Running was almost 30 at the time of his death and he was aged 37.

This bias is often measured by looking at the difference between estimates that people make about how many of their peers share a certain trait/ behaviour and the actual number of peers who report these traits and behaviours. Suls, J. (2007). False uniqueness bias. In R. F. Baumeister & K. D. Vohs (Eds.), Encyclopedia of social psychology (Vol. 1, pp. 345-345). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. doi: 10.4135/9781412956253.n213 In fact, people often think that they are more unique than others in regard to desirable traits. This has been shown in a variety of studies, where, for example, people believe that they are better drivers and less risk-taking than the average driver, less prejudiced than the average resident in their town, or even more hardworking in group projects than others when they are actually not. Svenson, O., 1981. Are we all less risky and more skilful than our fellow drivers? Acta Psychologica. 47 (2), 143-148. https://doi.org/10.1016/0001-6918(81)90005-6 Fields, J.M., & Schuman, H. (1976).

Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 37(3), 322‚Äì336. https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.37.3.322 This effect can also be visible when asked about desirable actions, even if consensus is against this action: \\"suppose a researcher did an experiment using an actor who pretended to have a seizure, and the researcher found that 11 out of 15 people did not help the person. If you had been in the experiment, what do you think your response would have been?\\". People tend to answer that they would have helped given the situation, believing they would do it even if that is not the case. This cognitive bias is opposed to the false consensus effect, in which people tend to overestimate the extent to which their attitudes and behaviours are normal and typical compared to those of others. Both are related to self-esteem, which is a crucial factor in defining how people look at their behaviour.

ISSN 1939-1315. History In 1975, Snyder and Shneckel introduced the term ‚Äúillusion of uniqueness‚Äù to describe how people wrongly believe that they are different from others. However, it is Suls, Wan (1987) and Suls, Wan and Sanders (1988) who coined the term false- uniqueness effect in their studies. These two demonstrated that people with low levels of self-reported fears or people that engaged in healthy behaviours underestimated the number of low-fear peers as well as the prevalence of those that were healthy compared to the actual numbers.Suls, Jerry; Wan, C.

In believing that people are relatively unique and better than others, they are able to enhance or at least maintain their self-esteem. In social comparison, people tend to modify, disregard, or interpret information differently to see themselves in a more positive light. This is also known as the self-enhancement theory. Seeking to ameliorate one‚Äôs self-esteem is a strong motivation to believe that your qualities are more unique than that of your peers. In fact, the false uniqueness effect is strongly associated with the perception of superiority or at least the avoidance of inferiority, which can be explained by self-preservation.Vera Hoorens (1993) Self-enhancement and Superiority Biases in Social Comparison, European Review of Social Psychology, 4:1, 113-139, DOI: 10.1080/14792779343000040 As self-enhancement may be a reason as to why false uniqueness effect occurs, cognitive biases or processes seek to understand how they might appear. =Cognitive processes= Egocentrism Egocentrism refers to the tendency for people to focus solely, or at least place more weight, on their own characteristics and neglect others‚Äô emotions, thoughts, attributes, and/or traits. This means that if people have high abilities, strong traits, make high contributions, or have intense emotions, they are more likely to rate themselves as above average in all of these domains. On the other hand, if people judge themselves to be low in all of the previous domains, they will consider themselves to be below average. Kruger, J. (1999). Lake Wobegon be gone! The \\"below-average effect\\" and the egocentric nature of comparative ability judgments. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 77(2), 221‚Äì232. https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.77.2.221 This tendency to focus on one‚Äôs own absolute standing, therefore explains how people might wrongly perceive certain traits, emotions, or attitudes to be both positively or negatively unique. Alicke, M. D., & Govorun, O. (2005). The Better-Than-Average Effect. In M. D. Alicke, D. A. Dunning, & J. I. Krueger (Eds.), Studies in self and identity. The Self in Social Judgment (p. 85‚Äì106). Psychology Press. People tend to think a lot more (and maybe even solely) about themselves when making a social comparison when they should be thinking about others as well as it could reduce false uniqueness effects. Focalism People have a tendency to give a lot more weight to information that has been brought to our attention and overlook background information that could be important when making a social comparison, also known as focalism. When making a comparison between two things (often you and another entity), a question might be framed in a way that makes you focus more on one or the other. Research shows that patterns of false uniqueness and false consensus can vary depending on how the question is written. Galesic, M., Olsson, H., & Rieskamp, J. (2018). A sampling model of social judgment. Psychological Review, 125(3), 363-390. http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/rev0000096 In determining how unique you are your evaluation will depend on what has been brought to your attention, whether it be traits, emotions, or a particular group of people, which might impair you in making a rational decision. Selective accessibility Aligned with egocentrism, when asked to make a social comparison, information about ourselves comes much more easily to mind, because we know a lot more about ourselves than about others. Therefore the more easily information about one‚Äôs particular trait comes to mind, the more importance it will have in the judgement of uniqueness. This can be linked to the availability heuristic, where people give more importance to information that they recall quickly. In accordance with the self-enhancement theory, people might also selectively choose to compare themselves to groups that are less successful than them, known as downward social comparison, as information about people that do not have the same qualities as them might come to mind more quickly. Alicke, M. D., & Govorun, O. (2005). The Better-Than-Average Effect. In M. D. Alicke, D. A. Dunning, & J. I. Krueger (Eds.), Studies in self and identity. The Self in Social Judgment (p. 85‚Äì106). Psychology Press. Generalized groups When asked to compare ourselves to the average person, because people don‚Äôt have access to information about everyone, they tend to associate ‚Äúaverage person‚Äù to a sub-group that may come to mind. Susskind, J., Maurer, K., Thakkar, V., Hamilton, D. L., & Sherman, J. W. (1999). Perceiving individuals and groups: Expectancies, dispositional inferences, and causal attributions. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 76(2), 181‚Äì191. https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.76.2.181 When asked ‚Äúare you a better ballroom dancer than the average person?‚Äù you might think of your grandfather, your boss, your cousin, or a video you watched online and compare yourself to these, even though they are far from representing the average person. These sub-groups that are based on your knowledge and surroundings might be an unconscious explanation of false uniqueness effect. Variables =Gender= There is a reported gender difference in the expression of the false uniqueness effect. Men tend to be biased in regards to both positive physical and social traits, whereas women tend to be more biased around positive social traits than they are physical traits.

He was born in Paris, France in 1961 and moved from there to Tripoli, Libya and then to London. He moved to Brooklyn in 1984 to attend Pratt Institute for an MFA after completing a BA in Art History at Trinity University in San Antonio, TX. He maintained a studio on New York City until 2012 and currently lives in Phoenix, AZ. Over a career spanning more than four decades, Magee has experimented widely with abstract and conceptual art practices. Magee‚Äôs compositions are organizations of shapes that have been informed by personal history, numerology, and language. Re-purposing a variety of found and collected media characterizes his sculpture and collage while his paintings explore language symbolically with an emphasis on repetition and reiteration and nods to art historical precedents. Magee's father, a geologist and archaeologist, took him on trips through the Southwest where he collected small objects along the way that later informed his art practices. As a young adult he worked on a seismic truck in Laredo, TX and recorded vibrations sent into the earth to determine underlying geologic formations. Later, Magee was the chief photo archivist for the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation. Throughout his life, he has established ways of collecting that now inform his compositions. Magee‚Äôs painting style is minimal in concept, but his brushstrokes are expressive. Within these conceptual spreadsheets, abacuses, and hieroglyphics are reminders of the artist‚Äôs hand. His visual language relates to early hard-edge abstraction and finds inspiration in contemporary scientific, ecological, and technological ideas. He is represented by Richard Levy Gallery in Albuquerque, NM; Hiram Butler Gallery in Houston, TX; Eagle Gallery in London; Inde/Jacobs Gallery in Marfa,TX; David Hall Fine Art in Wellesley, MA; and Mission Projects in Chicago. Magee was the 2017 Arlene and Mort Scult Award winner, the 2007 Josef and Anni Albers Foundation resident fellow, and winner of the Board of Trustees Award from the Silvermine Arts Center.

Both nations are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. History =Early history= Hasekura Tsunenaga, the first Japanese ambassador to Spain The first contact between Japan and Spain occurred in 1549 when Spanish missionary Francis Xavier arrived to Japan. While in Japan, Xavier embarked upon a major evangelizing project and he founded the first Catholic colony in Japan.Relations between Japan and Spain In 1565, Spain created the Manila-Acapulco trade route, which was a trade routes between Manila, capital of the Philippines and the Mexican port of Acapulco (both nations under Spanish rule at the time). Through this trade route, Spanish galleons sailed from Acapulco to the Philippines and traded with neighboring countries/territories within the vicinity. Some of those territories were the islands of Japan. In Manila, Japanese trading boats would arrive and bring goods and food to trade with the New Spanish government.Bilateral relations between Japan and New Spain (Mexico) (in Spanish) From Manila, Spanish vessels would transport the goods back to Acapulco, traverse the Mexican terrain until they reached the port of Veracruz and from there transport the goods onto another Spanish vessel for sail to Spain. In 1582, a group of Japanese Christian delegates known as the Tensh≈ç embassy left Nagasaki, Japan and traveled on a grand tour of Europe. In 1584, the embassy arrived to Toledo and Madrid where they meet with King Philip II of Spain. In October 1613, the first official Japanese diplomatic mission was sent to New Spain by Date Masamune, a regional strongman. This diplomatic mission was to be known as the Keich≈ç embassy and it was the second diplomatic mission to travel to Europe after the Tensh≈ç embassy. The Japanese ambassador, Hasekura Tsunenaga traveled from Japan to Acapulco and met with the Spanish viceroy Diego Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba. In Mexico City (the capital of New Spain), Hasekura met with several colonial leaders and offered the New Spanish government free commerce between the New Spanish territories and Japan and asked for a group of Christian missionaries to return to Japan. The diplomatic mission also offered to expel both English and Dutch citizens from the country because both nations were considered at the time to be enemies of the Spanish king. In June 1614, Hasekura left New Spain via Veracruz and continued on his journey to Spain to meet with the Spanish king leaving behind a small delegation. In Spain, Hasekura was baptized a catholic and changed his name to Francisco Felipe Faxicura. Two years later in February 1617, Hasekura/Faxicura returned from Spain to Veracruz and traveled to Mexico City. Before leaving Spain, Hasekura left behind six samurais in the town of Coria del R√≠o where their descendants remain today with the surname of Jap√≥n.Spain‚Äôs Japon clan has reunion to trace its 17th century roots Birthplace Monument of Traffic and Friendship between Japan, Spain and Mexico in Onjuku, Japan In 1618, Hasekura and his diplomatic mission set sail from New Spain and returned to Japan. On arrival, they were confronted with the fact that the country had dramatically changed since their departure in 1613 and that anything related to Christianity had been banned. Hasekura and his delegation had to renounce their adopted religion. Since Hasekura's diplomatic mission to Spain, Japan entered a time of isolation and refused to trade with foreign nations. It wasn't until 12 November 1868 that Japan and Spain officially established diplomatic relations with the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation.Espa√±a y Jap√≥n celebran 150 a√±os de relaciones diplom√°ticas (in Spanish) =Japan and Spanish Philippines= The Spanish diplomat F.E. Reynoso stated that during the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II in 1894, the Japanese made an offer of 40 million pounds sterling to buy the Philippines from Spain. At the time, the Philippines were a Spanish colony. However, according to the Reynoso, the Spanish did not accept this offer. According to the scholar C.E. Russell, in 1896 Spain was rumoured to have offered to sell the islands to Japan for $3,000,000 gold dollars, but this offer was rejected. During the Philippine revolution, Japan gave sanctuary to Filipino rebels righting against Spanish rule, including Jose Ramos who had a Japanese wife, and Jose Rizal. The Japanese had also blocked arms sales to the rebels and, at the request of Spain, had kept Filipino rebels in Japan under close surveillance. The start of the uprising in 1896 coincided with a visit of the Japanese cruiser Kongo to Manila, and members of the Katipunan approached the captain of the ship in an attempt to negotiate an arms deal with Japan. However, no steps were taken to undermine the 1897 Treaty of Friendship and General Intercourse that was then being negotiated between Japan and Spain recognising each other's spheres of interest. During the Spanish-American War Japan declared official neutrality. =Relations during the 1930s= Relations between Japan and the Spanish Republic were generally poor during the 1930s as the Spanish representative at the League of Nations had been prominent in efforts to sanction Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931. Following the outbreak of the Spanish civil war, Japan at first withheld recognition from Franco's regime, though they also did not intervene when diplomats loyal to Franco seized control of the Spanish embassy in Tokyo and prevented the entry of the Charge d'affaires appointed by the Republican government. Jos√© del Castillo, a Spanish diplomat in Japan loyal to the nationalist cause, first applied for official recognition of the Franco government by Japan in August 1937. K≈çki Hirota, the Japanese foreign minister at the time, responded to this by suggesting to Italian and German diplomats that recognition of the Spanish nationalist government should, in his view, also involve recognition of the Japanese-controlled state of Manchukuo. Franco accepted this, and on 12 November 1937 the Japanese cabinet decided to recognise Nationalist Spain and announced the decision publicly. The official ceremony of recognition was held in Tokyo on 1 December 1937, and the Franco government in turn recognised Manchukuo the day after. Both Japan and Nationalist Spain went on to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. =World War II and post war relations= During World War II, Spain initially aligned itself with the Axis powers (although officially neutral during the war). Japan chose Spain for the representation of Japanese interests in the Latin-American republics. The imminent victory of the United States in the Pacific Ocean theatre induced a change in the Spanish diplomatic position vis-√†-vis Japan and, using as pretext the massacre of Spanish nationals in the conflict, the former accused the later of deliberate attacks and toyed with the idea of a war declaration. Some members of the Spanish government viewed Japan as being \\"Anti-Christian and Anti- Western\\".Franco's Spain and the Japanese Empire On 17 March 1945, the Spanish government decided to withdraw its protection of Japanese interests. On 12 April 1945 Spain declared the rupture of diplomatic relations with Japan. Soon, Japan began suffering setbacks in the Pacific and Spain decided not to pursue further actions against Japan. Relations at the embassy-level were not fully re-established until 1952. In October 1980, Spanish King Juan Carlos I paid an official visit to Japan.Los Reyes inician hoy su primera visita oficial a Jap√≥n (in Spanish) In September 1994, Japanese Emperor Akihito paid an official visit to Spain.El emperador Akihito, de Jap√≥n, anuncia √©l mismo su viaje a Espa√±a (in Spanish) Since the initial visits, there have been several high level Royal and Governmental visits between leaders of both nations.

History In 1923, the IRT selected 470 gate cars for the MUDC conversion program, which were inherited by the company upon acquisition of other elevated railway lines in Manhattan.

This construction had an advantage, as a pocket does not have to be provided inside, which would otherwise disturb the interior equipment. These rebuilt cars had the operator's controls installed on both ends of the car, and the operator controlled the doors in the middle of the train. The motorman's operating cab was in the same position, but received some minor upgrades.Gene Sansone, New York Subways: An Illustrated History of New York City's Transit Cars, , pp. 49 - 53 Despite being a homemade conversion, the MUDCs presented a relatively fair appearance. The cars also proved to be extremely reliable for the crew and were the mainstay for the elevated lines. The first test train of MUDCs ran in 1923 on the IRT Second Avenue Line. They operated for many years until 1957, when all but the Bronx portion of the IRT Third Avenue Line was finally closed and demolished. None were preserved. Other usage of the MUDC name The term MUDC was sometimes extended to refer to a series of Hi-V and Lo-V cars (the Gibbs Hi-Vs, Hedley Hi-Vs, and Flivver Lo-Vs) that were modified in the early 1920s for multiple unit door control operation. Under normal circumstances, however, the term was usually reserved for the gate cars that were converted for the said operation.

After a theological education, Trautson earned his doctorate in the Holy Scriptures. The ordination he received on 26 September 1728 in Salzburg. He was first canon in Salzburg, then canon in Passau and Wroclaw, and provost of Ardagger. On 7 December 1750 he was appointed coadjutor of the Archdiocese of Vienna and titular archbishop of Cartagine. The episcopal consecration was bestowed by Archbishop Sigismund von Kollonitsch on 25 December of the same year. After the death of Cardinal Kollonitsch, he headed from 17 May 1751 the diocese as prince-archbishop. In a pastoral letter of 1 January 1752, he denounced the abuses of sermons, the superstitious beliefs of the people and excesses of indulgences. He was accused of being a Protestant. Maria Theresa appointed him protector of the theological and philosophical sciences at the University of Vienna and head of the new building of the university (now Old University and seat of the Austrian Academy of Sciences). Shortly before his death he was appointed on 5 April 1756 cardinal-priest. He was buried in the episcopal tomb of St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna. Bibliography * Franz Hadriga: Die Trautson.

These cars were built by the Pullman, Wason, Gilbert & Bush, Bowers & Dure, Barney & Smith, Jewett, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and American Car and Foundry companies. Background The Manhattan El cars consisted of a variety of equipment used on the IRT. The majority of the cars were originally built for the predecessor companies that became part of the IRT system in 1903, while other cars were built brand new between 1902 and 1911. Upon the arrival of the first steel cars, no more Manhattan El cars were produced after 1911. The term Manhattan El was derived from the Manhattan Railway Company, the predecessor railway to the IRT. The term was originally used to describe the gate cars, which had six pairs of four windows. The term would later be extended to refer to the entire series of IRT gated cars. When they were delivered, the word Manhattan was written on the roof of the car. The lettering was later changed to Interborough within a short period. The fleet comprised both motor cars and trailer cars. The older cars were intermixed with the newer cars upon the latter's delivery. Trains initially comprised three to six cars. An extra motor car would later be added to create a seven- car train. Historians disagree as to whether the term \\"Manhattan El\\" was commonly used before the IRT was purchased by the City of New York in 1940, or whether it was mainly an introduced term to describe the wooden elevated cars of the former private company. Disambiguation The primary distinguishing feature of Manhattan El cars is that they were elevated cars built mostly or substantially of wood, with or without steel frames, where passenger access to the cars was provided by open platforms at both ends of each car. A trainman between each pair of cars manually opened and closed folding gates to allow or prevent passengers from entering or leaving. All gate cars used in IRT elevated service can be described as Manhattan Els. This excludes several classes of elevated equipment: *Steam coaches of companies preceding the IRT that were never converted to, and used in, regular IRT elevated service. *Former Manhattan El cars (the MUDCs) that were converted into closed cars and the gates replaced by automatically operated subway-style sliding doors. The Manhattan El cars should not be confused with the BU cars, a series of gate cars that were operated by the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company. Preservation While most Manhattan El cars were either scrapped or rebuilt as MUDCs, a few cars have been preserved. *Manhattan El Revenue Collection car G is preserved at the Shore Line Trolley Museum. It was on temporary loan at the New York Transit Museum in 2000. *Car 824, the IRT Motorman Instruction Car, is preserved at the Shore Line Trolley Museum. *Cars 844 and 889 were used at the Richmond Shipyard Railway in California from 1943 to 1945, where they were renumbered 561 and 563, respectively.

She was one of the pioneer women in architecture, and successfully developed her career in San Francisco after the devastation caused by the earthquake and fire in 1906. Jewett studied at the Pratt Institute of Fine Arts in New York from 1900-1902, and her career spanned from 1902-1943.She is most well known for her success in designing apartment buildings, but she also worked on various industrial facilities. In 1913, Jewett opened her own practice in downtown San Francisco. She also often collaborated with Italian architect Italo Zanolini. Some of Jewett's most significant industrial designs include a factory for American Machine Works, a warehouse on 8th street, and a garage on Bush street. She is also known for her design of the Women's Club of San Mateo in the early 1920s. After moving to Los Angeles in 1923, it is unknown if Jewett continued her career in architecture because of a lack of records. In 1945, she officially retired as an architect. Ms. Jewett was partially crippled, and in her later life relied on the help of her longtime friend and partner, Erskine Hathaway. On April 12, 1946, Grace Jewett committed suicide, and the news reached the Oakland Tribune, but there was no mention of her achievements in architecture.

Opened in 2005, the museum has an area of over 400 square meters divided into 14 rooms, displaying a comprehensive collection of original exhibits based on and around the international film triumph The Third Man, directed by Carol Reed and based on a treatment by Graham Greene. The Third Man Museum is an independent two-person project, initiated by Gerhard Strassgschwandtner. He put together the extensive collection, whilst the design and concept came from Karin H√∂fler. Specialists and generalists, they created the museum from scratch. It is a private museum with no sponsors and subsidies. The museum is aimed not only at film fans but also those interested in the pre- and post-war history of Vienna. An extensive exhibition within the museum explains the historical backdrop of the film and portrays the everyday life of a city occupied by the Allies (Americans, British, Soviets and French) between 1945 and 1955, and includes many original documents from the period.  The collection  About 3000 original exhibits in the museum including: * Trevor Howard's personal script with hundreds of annotations, which he used for the filming in Vienna and in London. * Additional documents in the form of letters and photos from the private estate of Trevor Howard. * Film-specific correspondence from the author Graham Greene. * The cap worn by Herbert Halbik, who in the film played the little Hansel. With an interview and film documents from Herbert Halbik. * The film zither of Anton Karas used in 1949 in London to compose the film music and to record it for the film. * The former private exhibition of Anton Karas, which he installed in his garden house in Vienna and is today with its original hanging of documents and photos integrated into the Third Man Museum. * Documentations about all the actors in the film. * Two light-weight 35-mm film cameras (Debrie Parvo, models LS and K), which were rented for the British film team by the Austrian camera man Hans Schneeberger and which he used for shooting several short scenes of the film. * A special exhibition about Orson Welles including interviews with his long-time companion and muse Oja Kodar, who gave to the museum some items from her private archive. * The essential screenplays of The Third Man produced for the preparation and for the filming: The draft script, the second draft for the US co-producer David O.

Career In 1905, Castelhun became the second woman to be registered as an architect in the state of California. In addition to her career as an architect, Castelhun was also an artist, and is believed to have studied at the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art in San Francisco in the 1890s. In 1893, at the age of 25, Castelhun enrolled for the fall semester at the University of California, Berkeley. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1898, and later became certified to teach high school. However, she continued her graduate studies in architecture and was licensed in 1905. Only three buildings are specifically known to have been designed by Castelhun, three houses built for different women who were likely known to Castelhun. These include Olander House at 265-67 Lexington Street, San Francisco, built for Mathilda Olander; and 48-50 Merritt Street (now 3054-56 Market Street), built for Winifred McKeown. Another house was built at 68 Palm Street, San Francisco, for Margaret Doyle. Likely due to difficulties in finding clients in the aftermath of World War 1, Castelhun gave up her architecture license in 1921. She is buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland.

It was released on the Atari ST but is compatible with Atari TT and Atari Falcon. Production The creators of the game worked in their free time. The development was influenced by the inexperience of developers who had to learn a lot of things during their work on the game. They included a number of features that they retrospectively deemed unnecessary. The game was then tested by friends of the game authors. Piracy was a major issue at the time of the game. The authors therefore gave particular focus to copy protection. They had experience of copying games themselves, and therefore decided to create a particularly effective protection to prevent pirates from cracking the game. Unfortunately, this protection made it impossible to create physical copies or floppy images for use in emulators. In 2004, Marek Nepo≈æitek, then a co- founder of Cinemax, decided to re-release Hlava Kasandry, whose play on various platforms had previously been prevented by anti-piracy protection. He had to work around this, and did not find a solution until 2014; a free version for emulators was released in December 2014. Plot and gameplay The game is set for the future, when a handful of people have to survive in a world destroyed by a massive nuclear conflict. The game follows the story of Teodor Hornice, who deals with the destruction of dangerous warheads. He must destroy a rocket name Kassandra that could destroy the planet. The game is a mix of adventure, RPG and simulator. It is played with a joystick and a mouse. While players search for the missing rocket, they must pay attention to fuel and life while avoiding radioactive areas. Critical reception At the time of release, the game was accepted by the reviewers. The game received a rating of 76% from Narsil and 71% from Excalibur.

The tell is approximately 15 acres in size and is composed of the accumulated ruins of many large cities dating back to the Chalcolithic period.  History  The Galilee region is known for agricultural production, particularly olive oil. Tell Keisan is thought to have been a major granary for Akko. Tell Keisan is located off the ancient road of Via Maris which connected Egypt and Syria. Some scholars hypothesize that at one point in its history it was the city of Achshaph or Biblical Cabul. Tell Keisan was very large and prosperous in the early and middle Bronze Age. At this time it was fortified with a glacis and stone wall. In the late Bronze Age, the settlement was significantly smaller and a destruction level is distinguishable around the early 12 century BCE. It was rebuilt and reoccupied at the beginning of the Iron Age in the second half of the 11th century and appeared successful and \\"stratigraphically undisturbed.\\" It is hypothesized that during the Iron Age it was a Tyrian enclave of Phoenicia. In the 8th century it was again destroyed and abandoned. Reinhabited in the 7th c. where there is archaeological evidence of Assyrian civilization, and destroyed again by the end of that century. It was reoccupied throughout Persian and Hellenistic periods and again abandoned in the 2nd century BCE. Strabo refers to the city of Acre as once a rendezvous for the Persians in their expeditions against Egypt. According to historians such as Diodurus Siculus and Strabo, King Cambyses II attacked Egypt after massing a huge army on the plains near the city of Acre. In December 2018 archaeologists digging at the site of Tell Keisan in Acre unearthed the remains of a Persian military outpost that might have played a role in the successful 525 B.C. Achaemenid invasion of Egypt. The Persian-period fortifications at Tell Keisan were later heavily damaged during Alexander's fourth-century B.C. campaign to drive the Achaemenids out of the Levant.\\"2,500-Year-Old Persian Military Base Found In Northern Israel\\". 2015.

There is archaeological evidence of Roman artifacts and a major road passing on the west side of the tell was paved during the Roman period. A church was built during the Byzantine period and lasted until the 7th century CE. The land of Akko changed hands between the crusaders and Arab army of Saladin a number of times in the 12th and 13th centuries, and Tell Keisan was used by Saladin as a base.

Archaeological features  = Silver Hoard = Phoenician era Tell Keisan, particularly during the second half of the 11th century BC, is one of the find spots of silver hoards belonging to the Cisjordan corpus of hacksilber. The hoard was found in the courtyard of a domestic complex inside of a Phoenician Bichrome jug in Stratum 9a, Area B, L635. The hoard is the dated the earliest of the hoards in the Cisjordan corpus. The hoard includes cut ingots, sheets, wires, rods, jewelry, four linen wrapped bundles of hacksilber sealed with unbaked clay bullae, and loose fragments. The total weight of the hoard was 345g. Tell Keisan along with Tel Dor are the only locations in the Near East where bundles sealed with bullae have been found. The silver found here contains copper percentages, (19 ¬± 12.6%), that is much higher than naturally occurring amounts. Eshel et al. infers that this indicates that copper was intentionally added to the silver. This is one of the factors that causes Eshel et al. to refute the idea that the Cisjordan corpus was quality controlled. = Transport Amphorae = \\"Loop handle jars\\" are transport amphorae with two large handles that extend well above the lip of the jar. Dozens of loop handle jars were found in Tell Keisan. One variety of these jars, which were biconical shaped, dated to around 700-650 BCE. L. Courtois (1980) determined through petrographic analysis that these pots could not have been made locally in Tell Keisan. Gunneweg and Perlman (1991) traced the clay used to make these pots back to Kalopsida in Eastern Cyprus. They established this through Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA), comparing the composition of pots from Tell Keisan to clays from various potential sources. The clays seen in Tell Keisan appeared in two types, buff pink and grey green. These two are in fact of the same chemical composition and vary in color due to oxygenation conditions during firing. This variation was stated to be typical of the clay source in Kalopsida. In their analysis they also refute previous claims that this variety of loop handle jars originated from Rhodes, based again on chemical composition. It is also thought that the large quantities of bevel rimmed bowls, in comparison to other nearby locations, suggest a strong tie to Cyprus.

The battle took place near Pereyaslavl Ryazansky on the site, which was called Skornishchevo. The Muscovites won the battle forcing Oleg Ivanovich to flee, and not return to his rule for six months.  Background  After the death of the Grand Prince of Moscow Ivan II Ivanovich of Moscow, a lingering dispute between the Grand Principality of Moscow and the Grand Principality of Ryazan resurfaced. It was mainly generated by the new Grand Prince of Moscow Dmitri Ivanovich Donskoy's relations with Tver and Lithuania. Although, in 1370, troops from Ryazan and Principality of Pronsk went to help the Muscovites against Algirdas , the following year, an open war began between Moscow and Grand Principality of Ryazan. On 14 December 1371 Dmitri Ivanovich Donskoy, Grand Prince of Moscow, sent his troops to Ryazan under the command of Dmitri Mikhailovich Bobrok of Volhynia. The Grand Prince of Ryazan Oleg Ivanovich assembled his squad, and cheerfully took to the battle.  The battle  The Ryazanians already forgotten the failures of the previous wars with the Muscovites. The first 20 years of Oleg Ivanovich of Ryazan's reign awakened in them the consciousness of their own strengths, and they had previously discovered the certainty of victory. This confidence gave was met by northern chroniclers with contempt. > \\"Ryazanians, fierce and proud people, were so uplifted in their mind, that > they began to talk to each other insanely: do not take armor and weapons > with you, but take only belts and ropes with which to tie up the timid and > weak Muscovites. The latter on the contrary walked with humility and > sighing, calling on God to help. And the Lord, seeing their humility, raised > the Muscovites, and the pride of the Ryazans was humiliated. \\" The battle took place near Pereyaslavl Ryazansky on the site, which was called Skornishchevo. The Moscow troops were under the command of Dmitri Mikhailovich Bobrok, one of the most talented military commanders of the era. The Ryazan troops were under the command of Oleg Ivanovich who was extremely confident but did not have the experience of his counterpart. The Chronicle of the battle indicates that Dmitri Bobrok used in his favor the excessive arrogance of his enemies. > \\"The Ryazanians waved belt loops in vain, the chronicler continues; They > fell like sheaves and were killed like pigs. So the Lord helped Grand Prince > Dmitri Ivanovich and his soldiers: they defeated the forces of Ryazan, and > their prince, Oleg Ivanovich, barely escaped with a small group of > followers.\\" Belt and rope loops, which are mentioned in the chronicle, were probably nothing else than lassos, first used by the Ryazanians in the battle of Skornishchevo, but which were currently used by the Tartars in the steppes. No doubt, these lassos deceived the chronicler, who attributed to the Ryazanians such a frivolity, that they did not want to take weapons with them.  Consequences  Oleg Ivanovich fled. The rule of Pereyaslavl Ryazanwas taken by Vladimir Yaroslavovich Pronsky. (Six months later, Oleg Ivanovich returned to the capital with the help of the Tartar Murza.)

NGC 3256 is located about 100 million light years away and belongs to the Hydra-Centaurus supercluster complex. NGC 3256 provides a nearby template for studying the properties of young star clusters in tidal tails. The system hides a double nucleus and a tangle of dust lanes in the central region. The telltale signs of the collision are two extended luminous tails swirling out from the galaxy. The tails are studded with a particularly high density of star clusters. NGC 3256 is the most luminous galaxy in the infrared spectrum located within z 0.01 from Earth.  Characteristics  = Nuclei = NGC 3256 has double nuclei: the northern and southern nucleus, separated by 5\\", which at the distance of NGC 3256 corresponds to 850 pc. The nuclei are clearly visible in radiowaves and mid infrared, but the southern nucleus is hidden by dust lanes at the optical spectrum. The two nuclei will coalesce as the merger proceeds to its final stage. Lipari et al. note the presence of a third nucleus based on the presence of an obscured knot detected only at wavelengths Œª ‚â• 3.75 Œºm, which they suggest is a nuclear HII region. There is evidence of an outflow of ionised gas from the northern nucleus with shocks which is attributed to a superwind powered by the starburst. Based on observations by Spitzer Space Telescope, and Chandra X-ray Observatory, Ohyana et al. suggested that the southern nucleus of NGC 3256 is a heavily absorbed low luminosity active galactic nucleus, with X-ray spectrum consistent with a typical Compton-thin Seyfert 2 galaxy. = HII regions = Although NGC 3256 has seven large HII regions, a number small in comparison with other interacting galaxies, they are very luminous, with a total flux 85 times that of the Tarantula Nebula and they could host super star clusters. The HII regions conicide with X-ray emission regions, with possible sources being supernova remnants and X-ray binaries, which suggests the sources are in clusters with massive stars which may be initially embedded in HII regions. The HI mass of these features suggests they could be progenitors of globular clusters. = Tidal tails = NGC 3256 features two tidal tails. The two tails account for approximately 75% of the HI emission of the galaxy, which, however, includes a central absorption feature. Michael Rubrock et al. found that the two tails have different colors, suggesting different stellar populations. The eastern tail has mean stellar population age determined to be 841+125‚àí157 Myr and a larger percentage of mass belonging to the stellar population that was formed before the galaxy interaction. In the eastern tail were also detected several young (< 10 Myr), low mass objects with strong nebular emission, indicating a small, recent burst of star formation. The mean stellar population of the western tail was estimated to be 288+11‚àí54 Myr and its light is dominated by stars formed after the interaction. The tails feature large numbers of star clusters, especially the western tail.  Nearby galaxies  NGC 3256 belongs to a small group of galaxies which includes also the tidally disrupted NGC 3263 and NGC 3256C and roughly 15 more galaxies, as well as HI fragments. Some researchers have considered that NGC 3256 and NGC 3263 form two different groups but they are difficult to distinguish from each other spatially and two different group-finding algorithms applied to the same data catalogued the same galaxies in different groups. Among the features of the NGC 3256 group is a galaxy-sized intergalactic HI cloud known as the Vela Cloud, which as seen from Earth is not clearly associated with an individual galaxy but appears to be part of the group. The NGC 3256 group belongs to the Hydra-Centaurus supercluster.  Gallery  File:Peculiar galaxy NGC 3256.jpgNGC 3256 taken with the Wide Field Camera 3 and the Advanced Camera for Surveys.

She made her first appearance during the episode broadcast on 18 April 2017. The character was introduced alongside an extended branch of the show's long-standing Rebecchi family, who consist of Indian-Australians. The show's producer Jason Herbison thought their inclusion was important to better reflect Australian society. Actress Sharon Johal who plays Mishti's sister Dipi Rebecchi originally auditioned for the role of Mishti. When writers changed the characters age they hired Vas to play her instead. Vas made her final appearance as Mishti on 19 October 2018. Mishti is characterised as having a strong passion for physical fitness and is family oriented. She often plays the role of peacemaker in her family when they argue. Vas has described Mishti as a \\"harsh\\" character who is \\"righteous about staying within the law.\\" When Mishti arrives in Erinsborough she is keen to start a new life, suggesting she has a troubled past. She forms a business partnership with Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson) and opens a gym called The Shed. But viewers soon learn that Mishti is an ex-police officer who left the force following the death of her boyfriend Zander. Mishti's storylines have mainly focused on her relationship with Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano) and their many dramas. She also features in a pregnancy and miscarriage story. The character returns to the police force and begins investigating her neighbours who she believes are embroiled in the murder of Hamish Roche (Sean Taylor). Reaction to Mishti has been positive and Claire Crick from Soaplife branded her and Leo a \\"power couple\\". Casting The character and casting details were announced on 27 March 2017. Mishti is Dipi Rebecchi's (Sharon Johal) sister. She arrives in Erinsborough with Dipi's husband Shane Rebecchi (Nicholas Coghlan), an extended branch of the show's long-standing Rebecchi family. The new Rebecchis are an Indian-Australian family. The show's producer Jason Herbison stated that \\"we felt it was important that our new extended Rebecchi family reflect the cultural diversity of the community and our audience.\\" Network Ten's Head of Drama, Rick Maier added that \\"the new Rebecchi clan make for a very welcome addition to the neighbourhood, bringing fun, warmth and intrigue.\\" Vas was given the part a couple of days after she graduated from university, which she stated \\"was a dream come true\\". Vas found her first day on-set \\"nerve- wracking\\" but quickly settled into the role. Johal initially auditioned for the role after she received a call from the casting team. Mishti was originally supposed to be older, but casting directors decided to look for a younger actress following changes to the character's age. Producers still liked Johal's work and cast her as the much older Dipi instead. Mishti made her first appearance on 18 April 2017. Development =Characterisation= The show's official website have stated that Mishti is keen on physical fitness training and enthusiastic about starting a new life in Erinsborough. But she often appears sad because of her past experiences which are initially kept secret from viewers. Mishti is very family oriented and close to her sister Dipi. She has a history of being in the police force and therefore is keen to uphold the law. Vas has described Mishti as a \\"harsh\\" character who is \\"righteous about staying within the law.\\" She is also \\"kind, warm-hearted and sweet\\" despite her career. Vas also believes Mishti \\"certainly knows what she wants and how to get it.\\" Vas has said that Mishti's \\"smarts are like her super powers, she's very savvy.\\" She uses this in her approach to solving crimes. She behaves in a very moral and righteous manner. Vas said that when another character tries to bribe Mishti, it is a mistake because she is \\"Mrs Morals\\". In her approach to police work Mishti has proven to be a nosey neighbour. She wants to solve all the crimes in the show. Vas said viewers has obviously picked up on this trait as Mishti has to know everything in an investigation. =Introduction= Mishti arrives in Erinsborough to see her brother-in-law Shane. Coghlan, who plays Shane has explained that Mishti helps him when he considers moving to the area. The actor also described Mishti as \\"a dear friend\\" to Shane and said the two characters \\"share some pretty serious confidences.\\" Mishti comes to Erinsborough wanting a fresh start. However, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy thought she had a dark secret, noting \\"there's also an air of sadness about her.\\" One of Mishti's early roles in her family's story was trying to unite the bickering clan. A series of arguments had left the family angry at one another. Mishti realises she needs to solve the family feud following Dipi's refusal to celebrate their annual Hindi ritual Rakhi. Mishti takes drastic action by handcuffing everyone together and forcing them to speak. Mishti then decides to set-up a business in Erinsborough. She asks fellow fitness enthusiast Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson) to be her business partner in running a gym. He is hesitant but Mishti goes ahead and buys The Shed. Aaron later agrees to Mishti's plan and they open for business. Vas told a reporter from Inside Soap that Mishti \\"freaks out\\" when Aaron first changes his mind. She has to figure out what she can get out of the partnership. The pair eventually bond and become good friends whilst training together. Vas explained that Mishti is \\"obsessed with fitness\\" and Aaron's equal passion for it brings them together. Vas was happy with the on- screen friendship because it is \\"cute\\". Wilson was also happy with the pairing because it offered his character stability. In another storyline Mishti returns to working as a police officer. When Shane gets drunk and starts threatening Gary Canning (Damien Richardson) and vandalising his garden, she is forced to arrest him. Vas told an Inside Soap reporter that \\"if Mishti didn't do her job properly it would be very obvious to her superiors.\\" Dipi is angry with Mishti who believes she should have protected her family. But Vas explained that Mishti's role in the Erinsborough is to protect the public and Shane was being drunk and disorderly in public. The actress added that it is a moment when \\"she is a cop, not a sister.\\" In Mishti's early month's on-screen it became clear that she was hiding a secret. Mishti does begin to reveal certain aspects of her past to Leo Tanaka (Tim Kano). Vas told Alison James from Soaplife that she begins to confide in him after he earns her trust. Later Mishti and Shane discuss her secret in private which gives the impression they are having an affair. Vas explained that \\"whatever Mishti‚Äôs secret is, it‚Äôs complicated and it has the potential to cause problems within the family.\\" She added that Mishti definitely wants Shane to keep her secret from other characters in the show. In addition Neighbours wanted to keep viewers guessing at what her secret could be. Mishti and Leo later argue when she discovers that he has been sabotaging his half-sister Amy Williams' (Zoe Cramond) relationship with Nick Petrides (Damien Fotiou). Their row esculates when Mishti is distracted and backs her car into Tyler Brennan (Travis Burns) and runs him over. The scenes were written into the episode to bring back \\"painful memories\\" for Mishti involving a past car accident. =Relationship with Leo Tanaka= Since her inception Mishti shared many of her scenes with Leo, from which producers began developing a romantic relationship. Initially their bond takes a while to form. After befriending each other Mishti's reluctance to discuss her past causes problems. Vas told James from Soaplife that \\"Mishti starts dropping her guard and she begins to confide in him.\\" Leo, a character who had previously been portrayed as ruthless, began showing a caring side towards Mishti. Writers would continue to have the duo stuck contemplating a relationship but ultimately remain friends. Producers finally decided to unite the pair in September 2017. When Amy wants Leo to sell his share of the Robinsons hotel she concocts a plan to get him and Mishti together. She assumes that Mishti will be able to convince Leo to sell. Mishti is unaware of Amy's true intentions and thinks she is matchmaking. Leo is furious when he finds out Amy's deceit and presumes Mishti is part of the scam. But Mishti later convinces him of her innocence and they decide to begin a relationship. Their romance faces early issues when Leo kisses Courtney Grixti (Emma Lane) and Mishti witnesses the moment. Courtney is engaged to Leo's father, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) and he wants to see if she will be unfaithful. Mishti later forgives Leo when he explains he wanted to ensure Courtney was committed to his father and not after money. More problems followed focusing on the issue of trust. Mishti becomes secretive over her rogue investigation into the death of Hamish Roche (Sean Taylor). She lies about her whereabouts. But Mishti installed a tracking app on his telephone device, as a kind gesture to follow each other. Leo uses the app to track down Mishti and discovers she is lying. This caused Leo to believe he can no longer trust Mishti and they nearly break-up. Another issue arises when Leo's friend Elly Conway (Jodi Anasta) gets drunks and kisses Leo. The moment is witnessed by Dipi who informs Mishti, leading her to believe they were seeing each other. Mishti is forced to re-assume her role as peacemaker when Dipi and Leo begin arguing. Dipi believes that Leo has ill-advised her husband Shane over a business deal. She accusess him of plotting to secure a free urine powered generator Shane has invented. This is not true and Mishti is left with the task of solving their rift. They continue to bicker and fall into a swimming pool at a family barbecue. In March 2018, Neighbours confirmed a new pregnancy story featuring Mishti and Leo. Leo is hurt at the Robinson Heights development site. A slab of broken concrete falls on top of him and leaves him trapped. Mishti is called out to the incident and is shocked to find Leo. Vas told Ellis (Inside Soap) that Mishti is worried and can only reassure her boyfriend. But he is taken to hospital and recovers. The events lead Mishti to reveal her pregnancy. Vas explained that Mishti and Leo's relationship is still new, so she is unsure of how he will react. They had not thought about having children so are unsure about keeping it. But their families discover their news and are excited. The actress added \\"she and Leo aren't even sure they want to have the baby yet - but they're forced to go along with the family's celebrations.\\" But Vas told Sally Brockway from Soaplife that Dipi's advice and support actually helps Mishti accept her pregnancy. Dipi's encouragement about being a mother makes Mishti \\"feel like she can do it because Dipi is an amazing mum to her three children.\\" Mishti's next problem is telling Leo's father Paul as she fears his disapproval. To her surprise he is supportive. Vas added that Mishti thinks everything will be okay once Paul accepts the news. But she warned of many \\"twists and turns\\" for her relationship with Leo. It was later announced that Mishti would lose her unborn child in a miscarriage story. Mishti and Leo argue about his new role at Lassiters hotel and she experiences pains. When she is taken to hospital she is told that she has suffered a miscarriage. A reporter from Soaplife revealed that Mishti's loss would \\"utterly devastated\\" but ultimately bring Mishti and Leo closer together. Their resilience is short-lived when Mishti's friend Monique Hughes (Madeleine Vizard) visits and ruins their relationship. She was a colleague at the police academy Mishti and Zander attended. Monique discovers that Lassiter's has sold alcohol to a minor and blackmails him for money in exchange for her silence. =Dilhan Ozdil feud= Writers planned a revenge porn story for Mishti which began in June 2018. Rory O'Connor from the Daily Express reported that the story would leave a \\"trail of devastation\\" for the character. When Mishti attends a night out drinking with her friends she decides to have casual sex with Dilhan Ozdil (Kyle Hazebroek). She takes Dilhan back to her home and is unaware he intends to rob her. Vas told Maddison Hockey from TV Week that Mishti's reasons for her care-free behaviour is due to her need to move on from her miscarriage. She is initially \\"hesitant\\" but her friend Chloe Brennan (April Rose Pengilly) convinces her to have fun. Following their encounter Dilhan sneaks out of the bedroom to steal money, but Xanthe Canning (Lilly Van der Meer) disturbs him. Mishti is shocked and left questioning her behaviour but decides that she must track Dilhan down to arrest him. Then Mishti receives text messages revealing that he recorded them having sex and will upload it online if she does not drop the charges. Mishti ignores his threats and enlists the help of Aaron to retrieve the footage from Dilhan, which is unsuccessful and it is shared online. Mishti is left humiliated and feels ashamed when a stranger recognises her and makes a lewd remark. Mishti feels more positive when Dilhan is arrested but his family secure his bail and he is released. Vas told from Hockey that Mishti wants to move on but Dilhan receiving bail hinders that. She explained that Mishti \\"just feels defeated, she's very angry with the whole situation.\\" Leo becomes concerned and decides to try and trick Dilhan into breaking his bail conditions. He tries to cause a fight but when Dilhan goads him, Leo ends up punching Ned Willis (Ben Hall) instead. Dilhan continues to harass Mishti and sends her a series of threatening text messages. She worries her friends because of her reluctance to report the abuse. He threatens to visit her home and Mishti hears an intruder in her garden. Mishti is alarmed and recklessly withdraws her gun and fires a warning shot out of the door, which jeopardises her police career. =Departure= On 8 October 2018, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy confirmed that the character would be departing the serial the following week. Mishti decides to leave Erinsborough to join her fianc√© Pavan Nahal (Akkshey Caplash) in Sydney. Mishti's exit scenes aired on 19 October. The following day, Vas posted a message about her departure on Instagram saying she \\"loved portraying every minute\\" of Mishti. She added, \\" to all the amazing viewers during my time on @neighbours.. To all my Mishti fans, your love and support means the world to me and I can't wait for you all to come with me on my journey in the next stage of my career....\\" Storylines Mishti comes to Harold's Caf√© in Erinsborough to talk to Shane Rebecchi about whether his brother Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) can help them. Mishti then tells Shane that she might have found a way to solve their problem. Shane later tells Mishti that he is thinking of moving to Erinsborough, as he and his wife Dipi need a fresh start. She asks Shane if he has told Toadie everything, but he says he is planning to. Mishti stays at the Erinsborough Backpackers and flirts with Leo. They agree that neither of them want a serious relationship. Mishti surprises Dipi when she and her daughters finally arrive in Erinsborough. Mishti helps an injured Piper Willis (Mavournee Hazel) when a ute crashes into the backpackers hostel. She continues to stay involved in the investigation and drives Tyler to the city, so he can question T-Bone (Des Flanagan). When Tyler assaults T-Bone, Mishti reports him to the police and it emerges that she is a former police officer. Shane admits to Dipi that Mishti gave him a loan, as he lost a lot of money trying to get his solar- powered lawnmower to work. Mishti also reveals that she followed Shane to Erinsborough to help out and get away from her old life. Mishti befriends Aaron and they buy a local gym together. While arguing with Leo, Mishti gets into her car and reverses into Tyler. She briefly goes into shock, while Tyler is left with severe bruising. Mishti reveals to Leo that she was once engaged to a fellow police officer named Zander, who was run down and killed during an RBT patrol, and the driver responsible escaped justice. Shane later tells Dipi that shortly after Zander's death, he found Mishti smashing up the house and threatening to get justice for Zander. He stopped her from leaving with her service weapon, and she decided to quit the force. Mishti tells Dipi that the accident with Tyler reminded her of Zander. She starts a relationship with Leo. She finds Leo with Courtney and suspects he was cheating on her and runs off. Leo finds her and assures her that he was only trying to find out if Courtney was truly committed to her relationship with his dad, Paul. She is suspicious in the whereabouts of Gary and his mother Sheila Canning (Colette Mann) on the night of Hamish's death and investigates. Impressing the sergeant she is then offered to return to a job in the police force and accepts. Mishti tells Aaron that she will no longer be working with him at The Shed. Mishti investigates Paul's interference with hotel records, but is ordered to stop. She arrests Shane following a drunken public disturbance on Ramsay Street and puts him in a cell to sober up. Dipi is angry with Mishti arresting her own family, but she later forgives her sister. While on duty, Mishti receives a radio call indicating that an accident occurred at the Robinson Heights housing development site. Mishti arrives to find Leo being treated by paramedics after being crushed by a concrete slab. After Leo is given the all clear, Mishti tells him she is pregnant. Kirsha hears about Mishti's pregnancy and tells her family. Mishti experiences pains and miscarries her baby. She and Leo agree that it was too soon to start a family and move on. Mishti's former colleague Monique Hughes (Madeleine Vizard) visits and they reminisce about their time working with Zander. Monique discovers that Lassiters have illegally sold alcohol to Xanthe and she tries to blackmail Leo in exchange for her silence. This causes Leo to hire a private investigator and he discovers that Monique and Zander had been involved with illegal gangs. Leo informs Mishti who is devastated that her boyfriend, best friend and ex-fianc√© have all lied to her. She realises she can no longer trust anyone and ends her relationship with Leo. Mishti has a one-night stand with Dilhan Ozdil and he steals money from her purse. Dilhan threatens to upload footage of them having sex to the internet if she does not drop the theft charges. Aaron helps Mishti retrieve the footage and she arrests Dilhan. He is granted bail and makes the footage public. Mishti delivers a talk at Erinsborough High about the emotional impact of revenge porn. She tries to move on, but Dilhan starts sending her abusive text messages. When she is home alone Dilhan's texts make her feel unsafe. Chloe creeps into Mishti's back garden to check-up on her, Mishti withdraws her gun and discharges a warning shot. Mishti is overcome with guilt and reports herself to the police, who decide not to take any legal action and request that she retakes her weapon training. Mishti sells her half of The Shed to Paul. After an unsuccessful date with Rob Carson (Christopher Farrell), Mishti joins an arranged marriage website, where she meets Sydney dentist Pavan Nahal. After opening up about their pasts, Mishti and Pavan become engaged. Mishti agrees to help Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) search for Monique and contacts her. Monique has Dilhan beaten up, before meeting with Mishti. Monique realises she is being set up and Mishti arrests her. At the station, Mishti learns that she is compromised an investigation and is suspended. Pavan calls of the engagement when he learns about the sex tape and Mishti accuses Dipi of telling him about it. Dipi later intervenes and speaks to Pavan. She learns that Monique sent the video, and that he was angry that Mishti did not tell him about it. Pavan comes to see Mishti and they reconcile. When he receives a job offer in Sydney, Mishti decides to leave Erinsborough to be with him. Dipi organises a farewell party for her before she departs.

She added \\"it's been clear from the off she‚Äôs hiding something.\\" Claire Crick from Soaplife said \\"Leo Tanaka and Mishti Sharma are certainly something of a power couple. Not only are they both massively successful in their beloved jobs, but they also make a beautiful pairing to boot.\\" Another branded her \\"mysterious Mishti Sharma\\". Sasha Morris from the Daily Star has called the character a \\"brunette bombshell\\" and \\"peacemaker\\", adding \\"Mishti cemented her position as Neighbours' latest hottie.\\" Responding to the viewers incorrect theories Mishti is Dipi's secret daughter, Morris said \\"that would be the mother of all plot twists.\\" Helen Daly from the Daily Express named her \\"the new cop on the block\\", \\"mysterious new character\\" and said she was \\"like every police officer that's come before her\\" for mistrusting Paul.

Following her travels, she worked in Hallau, Flims and Z√ºrich, until she started her own firm in 1940. Rahm was strongly influenced by Scandinavian architecture and built various vacation houses, single-family residences and exhibition pavilions, most notably the 1959 pavilion for SAFFA, in the Scandinavian style. The relative social and personal freedom allowed women in Scandinavia also formed a lasting impression on Rahm. In 1942 she put together a book on the subject illustrated with her own drawings. Her position as a woman made it difficult for Rahm to secure building licenses and she was excluded from design competitions, especially for profitable public building projects, and she decided to close her firm and retire as an architect in 1966.Jakob, Evelyne Lang. \\"The Life and Work of Berta Rahm, 1910 - 1998,\\" IAWA Newsletter, Fall 1999, V. 11, p. 1.

Growing to at least tall and broad, with flowers and leaves up to long, this climbing, twining shrub is by far the largest of all the honeysuckles. The evergreen leaves are glossy, and the long thin tubular flowers open cream, turning to yellow and orange. The flowers, which have a strong honeysuckle fragrance, appear in pairs intermittently from spring throughout summer, and are followed in autumn by green berries. Lonicera hildebrandiana was found in Burma (now Myanmar) in 1888 by Henry Collett, who named it after a local administrator Arthur Hedding Hildebrand, himself an enthusiastic collector. Hildebrand later sent seeds to Kew Gardens for storage and propagation purposes. Since then, specimens have been located in China and Thailand. This plant does not tolerate frost, so when cultivated in cold temperate areas it must be grown under glass, either in a large conservatory or greenhouse. When grown in warmer temperate zones, it may be planted in a sheltered bay out of direct winter winds until it has grown to a height above the frost-line. A fully grown plant is relatively heavy, especially after rain, so requires strong support as it is not self- supporting. It has been given the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit.

It is the oldest Catholic parish in Rochester. At the time of its founding, the property where the parish's buildings continue to stand was acquired. A church was completed in 1872 and dedicated by Bishop Thomas Grace of St. Paul. As the parish grew, a larger church building was completed in 1905. Three schools, a grade school, a girl's high school and a boy's high school opened in 1913. Plans for the present church were completed by New Ulm architect Edward F. Wirtz, and construction began in 1955. Local contractors completed construction two years later. The Modern structure features an exterior composed of Mankato stone and a seating capacity of 1,200. It was extensively renovated from 2001 to 2002. On March 27, 2018, Pope Francis elevated the church to be the co-cathedral of the newly renamed Diocese of Winona- Rochester.

Lamone, 585 U.S. ____ (2018), and Lamone v. Benisek, 588 U.S. ____ (2019) were cases before the Supreme Court of the United States dealing with the topic of partisan gerrymandering arising from the 2011 Democratic party- favored redistricting of Maryland. At the center of the cases was Maryland's 6th district which historically favored Republicans and which was redrawn in 2011 to shift the political majority to become Democratic via vote dilution.For a discussion of vote dilution, see the working paper from the University of Chicago Law School, Addressing Minority Vote Dilution Through State Voting Rights Acts Affected voters filed suit, stating that the redistricting violated their right of representation under Article One, Section Two of the U.S. Constitution and freedom of association of the First Amendment. Overview Benisek v. Lamone, a case challenging the denial of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland to place an injunction on the controversial redistricting maps for the upcoming 2018 elections, was heard during the 2017‚Äì2018 term following the court's decision in Gill v. Whitford. The court, in a per curiam decision, affirmed the District Court's ruling, and remanded the case for further hearings to take Gill into consideration. The District Court later ruled that the maps represented unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering and ordered new maps to be drawn. The state challenged this in Lamone v. Benisek, which the Supreme Court heard in the 2018‚Äì2019 term alongside Rucho v. Common Cause, a partisan redistricting case from North Carolina. The Supreme Court ruled in both Lamone and Rucho by a 5-4 majority that questions of partisan gerrymandering represent nonjusticiable political questions and remanded each case back to its district court with instructions to dismiss the case. Background In the United States, the number of representatives for each state in the House of Representatives is based on that state's population. Population counts are derived from the results of the United States Census, which is conducted every ten years. Because population figures are updated following each new census, redistricting, or changing the boundaries of the state's districts, may be required to conform with changes in population. Redistricting is typically done by representatives of the political party in power within the state and can result in the practice of gerrymandering, creating oddly-shaped districts that favor one party's or group's chances of election. The Supreme Court has ruled that gerrymandering based on racial and ethnic grounds is unconstitutional and has stated that partisan gerrymandering is also likely unconstitutional, but has yet to develop a valid means to determine when partisan gerrymandering has occurred. Maryland redistricting The district map of Maryland from 2003 to 2013 The district map of Maryland as of 2013 For the 2010 Census, the Census Bureau recommended that states count incarcerated prisoners as living in the location of their group quarters, rather than at their home location. Within Maryland, most prisoners are African-American, and the largest prisoner populations were located in the state's 4th and 6th districts, which are otherwise predominantly populated by Caucasians. Because prisoners do not have the right to vote but would nevertheless be counted as residents of the prisons' districts, concerns were raised of \\"prison-based gerrymandering,\\" such that the districts housing the prisoners would have inflated population counts, while the home districts of the prisoners-- often metropolitan areas like Baltimore-- would have diminished populations. In 2010, Maryland passed a first-of-its-kind civil act, the \\"No Representation Without Population Act\\", which would have prisoners counted for the decennial census within their home district. Maryland has traditionally been a Democratic-heavy state, and according to FiveThirtyEight, non-gerrymandered or proportionally partisan districts in Maryland could range from four to six likely Democrat seats, suggesting that a proper redistricting of the state's eight districts would result in four to six districts favoring Democrats, and two to four either favoring Republicans or remaining competitive. Democratic analysts envisioned the possibility of an \\"8-0 map\\" which aspired to shut Republicans out of elections altogether; however, this may have endangered some incumbents, who rejected the proposal because they wanted to stay in office more easily. However, Democratic leaders saw the potential to create a district map that would give Democrats seven districts to the Republicans' one, or the \\"7-1 map\\". The state Democrats drew on services from the National Committee for an Effective Congress (NCEC) to determine how to create this \\"7-1 map\\". The issue was how to remap the two Republican-leaning districts, the 1st and the 6th. After reviewing options, advisers and mapmakers settled on remapping only the 6th district, because redrawing the 1st district to achieve their goal would have split the district across the Chesapeake Bay, an undesirable outcome. Ultimately, a 7-1 map favoring Democrats was implemented. Benisek v. Lamone =First legal challenge= The new redistricting was initially challenged in Fletcher v. Lamone, a case brought by a number of African-American voters who believed that the new map diluted the strength of the African-American vote, violating the requirement of equal representation under Article One of the United States Constitution, equal protection granted by the 14th Amendment and equal voting rights from the 15th Amendment. They further challenged the \\"No Representation Without Population Act\\", believing this further constituted a dilution of their vote. The case was heard by a three-judge panel at the District Court of Maryland in December 2011, and in a unanimous decision, the District Court found in favor of the state, issuing a summary judgement that asserted that the plaintiffs had not shown harm from the new district map nor from the Act.RWT-11cv3220 On appeal to the Supreme Court, the court issued a summary disposition that upheld the District Court's ruling.11-1178. 133 S.Ct. 29 (2012) =Second legal challenge= A separate challenge arose from other residents of the state in 2013. Aware that the District Court of Maryland had ruled that the redistricting map was not considered partisan based on Fletcher v. Lamone, these citizens challenged the redistricting's use of \\"narrow ribbons and orifices\\" that were used to connect non-contiguous regions having a targeted population distribution in the state's 4th, 6th, 7th, and 8th districts. Of particular concern was the 6th district. Previously it had covered most of the rural northwestern part of the state along the Pennsylvania border and was a predominantly Republican district with a largely Caucasian population that had supported Representative Roscoe Bartlett for two decades. After redistricting, the 6th district still covered the western arm of the state, but now also included many of the suburban and metropolitan areas across the border from Washington D.C., thereby increasing the number of African-American voters within it. The number of registered Republicans dropped by 70,000 voters, roughly 20% of the registered voters in the district. As a result, Bartlett lost his seat to Democrat John Delaney in the 2012 elections by more than 20% of the vote. The complaint stated that because these majority Republican districts had been remapped to predominantly represent Democrats, the new district boundaries violated their rights of equal representation, the right to vote under the 14th Amendment, and the rights of association under the 1st Amendment. The case, filed as Benisek v. Mack, was reviewed by Judge James K. Bredar who deemed that none of the complaints brought by the plaintiffs were actionable and denied the request for a standard three-judge hearing in April 2014. Judge Bredar did find that the case represented a substantially different subset of residents than Fletcher and rejected the defense's argument for res judicata. In response to the plaintiffs' arguments, Judge Bredar found that the plaintiffs did not provide an effective measure to demonstrate partisan gerrymandering as suggested by Vieth v. Jubelirer, thereby nullifying their Article One and 14th Amendment claims, and that the affected citizens still had their rights to participate in the political process intact, thus denying any relief based on the 1st Amendment claim. The plaintiffs appealed to the Fourth Circuit Appeals Court, but the appeal was summarily denied in October 2014 on the basis that their claims were insubstantial, as determined by Bredar. The plaintiffs issued a petition for writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court of the United States, arguing that because the District Courts are required to hear any substantial constitutional challenges to state redistricting under Section 2284 of Title 28, the Appeals Court's dismissal based on the \\"insubstantial\\" claim was inappropriate. The case, Shapiro v. McManus, was accepted by the Supreme Court in June 2015, with oral arguments heard in November 2015 and the decision issued in December 2015. The court unanimously agreed with the petitioners that the claims presented were not insubstantial, thus clearing the bar set by Goosby v. Osser, and ordered a full three-judge hearing of the case at the District Court; the court did not otherwise comment on the merits of the petitioners' complaints related to the redistricting. Second hearing The new hearing before Circuit Judge Paul V. Niemeyer, Chief District Judge Bredar, and District Judge George Levi Russell III began in 2016. The plaintiffs had revised their case to focus specifically on the redrawn boundaries of the 6th district, which had had the greatest shift in voter demographics. While the state attempted to dismiss the case, the court denied dismissal in a 2-1 decision (with Bredar dissenting) in August 2016, allowing the case to move into the discovery phase. Both sides sought to expedite the case through summary judgments in mid-2017. In June 2017, however, the Supreme Court announced that they would be hearing the Gill v. Whitford case later that year. The plaintiffs in Benisek, in anticipation of the upcoming 2018 elections, requested that the District Court issue an injunction preventing the state of Maryland from using the 2011 redistricting maps, as the state was seeking a stay of proceedings for the case until Gill v. Whitford was concluded. The District Court denied the plaintiffs' request and issued a stay on the case in August 2017, pending the conclusion of Gill v. Whitford. =Supreme Court= Seeking an expedited ruling, the plaintiffs filed a request for a jurisdictional statement to the Supreme Court on September 1, 2017 to reverse the District Court's denial of summary judgement and injunctions and placing the case on hold. While the Supreme Court declined to reverse the District Court's orders, the court did agree to hear the case on its merits on December 8, 2017. Oral arguments were heard on March 28, 2018. In contrast to Gill v. Whitford, the justices seemed to indicate that the redistricting of Maryland's 6th district was a much more aggressive partisan gerrymandering than that in Wisconsin, but still debated whether they had a proper measure to evaluate partisan division, whether the court should be involved in that decision, and whether such matters are to be regulated through federal or state legislation. The Court issued its per curiam decision affirming the Appeals' Court ruling on June 18, 2018, the same day that the Gill decision was announced. In the decision, the court did not address the merits of the gerrymandering case, but instead found that the Appeals Court, in denying the issuing of an injunction on the use of the redistricting maps, had not engaged in an \\"abuse of discretion\\", given both the pending legal challenge of Gill and the need for \\"due regard for the public interest in orderly elections\\". The decision further argued that the plaintiffs had waited too long from the time that the redistricting maps were certified to file their case. Lamone v. Benisek Following the per curiam decision and the conclusion of Gill v. Whitford, the District Court rescheduled hearings on the case on October 4, 2018. The District Court subsequently ruled on November 7, 2018, finding for summary judgement in the plaintiffs' favor that the revised boundaries of the 6th district were unconstitutional, and required the state to redraw its district maps in a more neutral manner by March 7, 2019, with the new maps to be approved by the court; otherwise, the court would assign an independent three-member commission to oversee the redistricting, ensuring that new maps would be available prior to the 2020 election. State governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, had stated his intent to let the ruling stand and engage with the state's general assembly to pursue redistricting, but the attorney general Brian Frosh, a Democrat, stated his intention to appeal the District Court ruling, potentially directly to the United States Supreme Court. Frosh also sought a stay of the District Court's redistricting order while the matter of appeal was under discussion. =Supreme Court= Frosh petitioned the Supreme Court to hear the new challenge of whether the District Court could make its summary judgement, and the court agreed in early January 2019 to hear the case. This new case was heard as Lamone v. Benisek (Docket 18-726) alongside Rucho v. Common Cause, another partisan gerrymandering case from North Carolina. The case was decided on June 27, 2019; a 5-4 majority determined that claims of partisan gerrymandering present a nonjusticiable political question that could not be handled by the federal court system. Along with Rucho, the Supreme Court vacated the District Court's judgement and remanded the case to that court, effectively leaving the existing redistricting maps in place.

It was developed and published by Astragon.  Gameplay  A screenshot of the gameplay of Water Park Tycoon, showing many of the core game features. The goal of the game is to build a successful water park. When a world is launched, there is a large fenced-in space where the player can build their water park, as well as a ticket booth. The park is closed when by default, but the player can open it at any time, which will cause guests to be able to enter the park. Several types of pools, water slides, playground rides, food stalls, and vegetation are available for the player to improve the park. When any of these are bought, the player will lose money. Money is gained when guests buy food or drink, or purchase a park ticket. The player can set the price of both of these, but if the price is too high, guests will not want to purchase an article or ticket, and the park rating will drop. The park rating is represented by a star with a number in it as well as a percentage on the top right of the screen. The percentage and number start off at 0, but as the water park is expanded and improved, the percentage will go up, causing the number to come up too. Once the percentage gets to 90%, the number will be up to 5, which is the highest it can go. In addition to building attractions and stalls, the player can also hire staff. These staff will perform tasks such as cleaning up the park, improving safety, and watering plants. Staff help improve the park greatly, and will therefore increase the park rating. However, the more staff the player hires, the more money they lose at the end of an in-game month.

It was built by Schneider-Creusot for use in their own plant. Overview At the beginning of the twentieth century, steam locomotives continued to dominate the railways but alternatives were being considered. One of the problems to be solved was that of finding a cheap fuel. Liquid fuels, such as naphtha, petrol, benzole and alcohol had all been tried, but were expensive. Naphthalene seemed attractive because of its low cost, due to its origin from coal tar. An experiment was carried out by Schneider-Creusot. The Schneider establishment consisted of two distinct areas that were connected to each other by a rail link running through a tunnel. Steam traction was in use and the tunnel was filled with smoke from the locomotives. Following experiments carried out on a Renault car, it was decided to build a small naphthalene-powered locomotive. The project The prototype was designed by the chief designer of Schneider, Eug√®ne Brilli√©, in conjunction with the Society of French Civil Engineers. The locomotive was standard gauge with a cab and a bonnet containing the engine. There were two sets of buffers, at different heights, for coupling to normal railway wagons and to flat wagons for internal use within the plant. It was equipped with an automobile-derived internal combustion engine with four cylinders, a displacement of 12,300 cm¬≥ and a maximum power of 50 kW. The engine was designed by Brilli√©. =Fuel supply= Since naphthalene, at ordinary temperature and pressure, is in a solid state, the engine was started with petrol or benzene. The naphthalene tank was enclosed in a water jacket, which was heated to boiling point by engine exhaust. Once the naphthalene (melting point 80¬∞C) had liquified, it could be used as a fuel. British patent 26541 awarded to Gaston Paul Jean Lion and Eug√®ne Brilli√© in 1907, describes a fuel melting system but it differs from that described above. There is no water jacket and the solid fuel is heated directly by the exhaust gas. It would be difficult to regulate the temperature in such a system and this may be why the water jacket was introduced. The water jacket system was a Schneider patent, GB190821478. =Transmission= Transmission of power from the engine to the wheels was by a pneumatic transmission system called the \\"Hautier aerothermal transformer\\". It consisted of an air compressor, driven by the prime mover, which fed a compressed air motor which drove the wheels. Hautier is not identified but he may have been Camille Jean Hautier who held several patents for compressed air transmission systems, e.g. GB190928918 and GB191308846. The general construction of the machine was similar to that of other locomotives of its time. From the little information available, it seems that it was equipped with a handbrake only. Operation The locomotive began its service in 1913 within the Schneider plant. The company's management then asked the Chemins de fer de l'√âtat to test it with their dynamometer car. The trials took place in April 1913 on a two-kilometre link between the Harfleur workshops and the Le Hoc range. The locomotive hauled a load of up to 160 tonnes with a tractive effort of 7.9 kN. In regular use within the Schneider plant, the locomotive met expectations for traction but its maintenance proved to be very onerous. A similar, but narrow-gauge, locomotive of 150 kW was built for a railway company in southern Algeria but it appears to have been scrapped after only a few years. Other countries =United Kingdom= There was also interest in the use of naphthalene as a motor fuel in the United Kingdom. In 1917, the Commercial Motor reported on experiments conducted by J.H. Willis and G.G. Wilson, of Birmingham Corporation Gas Works, using naphthalene fuel in a 10 hp motor boat engine. The tests were hailed as a success but nothing further seems to have been done. =Mexico= The idea seems to re-surface periodically. A 1997 patent of Luis Cisneros Zazueta claims: \\"The invention can be used for all type of four-cycle gasoline engines operating under the Jammes Otto thermodynamic cycle, which comprise a carburator or a fuel injection system, the number of cylinders being unimportant. Naphthalene low cost and efficiency make the use of this device inexpensive\\". References Further reading * M. L.

It stars Margaret Qualley, Anthony Mackie and Danny Huston. It was released on January 18, 2019, by Netflix. Plot The film is set in a post-apocalyptic present, where Earth's atmosphere has become toxic. Most humans have fled the planet, to live on a space station near Io, a moon of Jupiter. Sam Walden is one of the few humans remaining on Earth. She lives alone at high altitude, where the air is still breathable, trying to raise bees that can survive in the atmosphere. Her intent is to use the bees to eventually clean the air via the pollination of oxygen-producing plants. Her long-distance boyfriend, who lives on the Io station, urges her to leave Earth on the last shuttle from the planet. A storm creates a toxic cloud that passes through Sam's shelter, killing all of her bees. Micah, a man travelling by helium balloon, arrives shortly thereafter. He intends to reach the launch site and leave Earth, but first wants to speak with Dr. Harry Walden, Sam's father, who had urged mankind to stay because he still saw hope. Initially, Sam states that her father is conducting field work elsewhere. However, after a day, she reveals that her father died the previous year. Hearing this, Micah is determined to take Sam with him to the space shuttle, to which she apathetically agrees. After receiving a message from her boyfriend saying goodbye, because he is part of an expedition embarking on a 10-year voyage to an exoplanet orbiting Alpha Centauri, Sam records a message informing everyone still on Earth that Dr. Walden's attempt to clean the planet was ultimately unsuccessful and that everybody should leave to Io. While preparing and waiting for the right wind conditions, Sam and Micah grow closer and become romantically involved. They also discover that a new queen bee hatched in Sam's hive, which is immune to the toxic air. They are informed that the shuttle launch is rescheduled to another site, farther away than the original. As a result, they drive into a city blanketed by the toxic atmosphere to obtain the helium required for the journey. After finding the helium, Sam visits an art museum alone. Micah rushes after her, knowing her oxygen tank is running low. Instead of switching to a new tank, Sam pulls off her mask and breathes the toxic air hoping to survive. She takes several breaths, as the scene fades to black. Micah travels alone to the spaceship because Sam has decided to stay behind. Like the new queen bee in her colony, the changed environment is not toxic to Sam. The film ends with her standing on a beach alone before being joined by a young child. A voice over of a letter from Sam to Micah tells how beautiful the Earth is, how those who have left the planet will have learned to fear it, and that they are waiting for them to return. Cast * Margaret Qualley as Sam Walden * Anthony Mackie as Micah * Danny Huston as Dr. Harry Walden * Tom Payne as the voice of Elon Production In January 2015, it was reported that Elle Fanning and Diego Luna would star in the film with Clay Jeter directing from a screenplay he co-wrote with Will Basanta and Charles Spano. However, in October 2016, Margaret Qualley replaced Fanning, while Anthony Mackie replaced Luna, with Danny Huston also cast for the film. Jonathan Helpert was also set to replace Jeter as director while retaining the Jeter/Basamta/Spano screenplay. Principal photography began in October 2016.

In 2007, Loeb's research on teacher education was awarded the Distinguished Research in Teacher Education Award by the Association of Teacher Educators.  Research = Research on teacher labour markets= One major area of Susanna Loeb's research concerns the labour markets of teachers, which she has explored notably with Donald Boyd, James Wyckoff, Hamilton Lankford, and Pamela Grossman. Analysing the sorting of teachers by qualifications in New York with Lankford and Wyckoff, Loeb found that low- income, low-achieving and non-white students, especially in urban schools, are generally taught by the least skilled teachers, with salaries rarely leaning against and sometimes even contributing to this sorting.Lankford, H., Loeb, S., Wyckoff, J. (2002). Teacher Sorting and the Plight of Urban Schools: A Descriptive Analysis. Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 24(1), pp. 37-62. In further research with Boyd, they find teacher labour markets' spatial scope to be very small as teachers display strong preferences for proximity, which in turn makes it more difficult for urban schools to recruit new, well-qualified teachers.Boyd, D. et al. (2005). The draw of home: How teachers' preferences for proximity disadvantage urban schools. Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 24(1), pp. 113-132. Overall, they attribute teacher sorting to a combination of more qualified teachers being more likely to leave schools with very low-performing students and schools with such students generally experiencing higher turnover than other schools,Boyd, D. et al. (2005). Explaining the short careers of high-achieving teachers in schools with low-performing students. American Economic Review, 95(2), pp. 166-171.Boyd, D.J. et al. (2006). Complex by Design: Investigating Pathways Into Teaching in New York City Schools. Journal of Teacher Education, 57(2), pp. 155-166. though high growth in student achievement can effectively act as a retention mechanism for effective teachers in low-achieving schools.Boyd, D. et al. (2011). The role of teacher quality in retention and hiring: Using applications to transfer to uncover preferences of teachers and schools. Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 30(1), pp. 88-110. In particular, effective teachers tend to leave low-achieving schools (but not high-achieving schools) within their second and third years at these schools, thereby likely contributing to the widening of the learning outcomes between students; by contrast, less effective teachers tend to leave both low- and high-performing schools within their first year. Studying why exactly teachers at low- performing schools in California are more likely to request transfers, Loeb and her co-authors find low teacher salaries and bad working conditions in schools (e.g. large class sizes, facilities problems, multitrack schools, and lack of textbooks) to be the main reasons besides negative interactions with students,Loeb, S., Darling-Hammond, L., Luczak, J. (2005). Teaching Conditions Predict Teacher Turnover in California Schools. Peabody Journal of Education, 80(3), pp. 44-70. though similar research in New York City by Loeb instead finds that teachers' (negative) perceptions of the school administrations are the main driver behind transfers.Boyd, D. et al. (2011). The influence of school administrators on teacher retention decisions. American Educational Research Journal, 48(2), pp. 303-333. The resulting teacher turnover evidently harms students' test scores in math and English language arts, especially in schools with many Black and low-performing students.Ronfeldt, M., Loeb, S., Wyckoff, J. (2013). How Teacher Turnover Harms Student Achievement. American Educational Research Journal, 50(1), pp. 4-36. However, narrowing the gap between the qualifications of teachers in high- and low-performing schools is possible; for example, the NYC Teaching Fellows and Teach for America initiatives were able to substantially reduce such a gap between New York City's low- and high-poverty schools over 2000-2005 by substituting uncertified teachers in high-poverty schools by academically qualified teachers.Boyd, D. et al. (2008). The narrowing gap in New York City teacher qualifications and its implications for student achievement in high-poverty schools. Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 27(4), pp. 793-818. Further research by Loeb and her co-authors on teachers' preparation and recruitment has found that teachers with reduced pre-job coursework often provide smaller initial gains in both math and English language arts when compared to teachers who completed a university-based teacher education programme, though most differences disappear as the cohort matures.Boyd, D. et al. (2006). How changes in entry requirements alter the teacher workforce and affect student achievement. Education Finance and Policy, 1(2), pp. 176-216. Another article suggested that New York City teacher preparation programmes' vary in their impact on teachers' value added to student test score performance,Boyd, D.J. et al. (2009). Teacher Preparation and Student Achievement. Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 31(4), pp. 416-440. though a later reanalysis found no differences between programs except for one small outlier.von Hippel, P. T., & Bellows, L. (2018). How much does teacher quality vary across teacher preparation programs? Reanalyses from six states. Economics of Education Review, 64, 298-312. A 2013 study by Loeb and her colleagues teachers who have the highest value added to student test performance have distinctly different instructional practice profiles, e.g. consistently scoring better on Explicit Strategy Instruction.Grossman, P. et al. (2013). Measure for measure: The relationship between measures of instructional practice in middle school English language arts and teachers' value-added scores. American Journal of Education, 119(3), pp. 445-470. Finally, in research with Marianne Page, Loeb finds that - contrary to earlier estimates - raising teacher wages by 10% reduces high school dropout rates by 3-4% once the true opportunity costs of being a teacher - e.g. alternative wage opportunities and non-pecuniary job attributes - are taken into account.Loeb, S., Page, M.E. (2000). Examining the link between teacher wages and student outcomes: The importance of alternative labor market opportunities and non-pecuniary variation. Review of Economics and Statistics, 82(3), pp. 393-408. = Research on principals= A second and more recent area of Loeb's research studies the role of principals with regard to school and student success. In research with Eileen Horng and Daniel Klasik, Loeb finds that the time used by school principals on organization management activities improves school and student outcomes, whereas day-to-day instruction activities tend to have no effect on student performance and deteriorate teachers' and parents' school assessments.Horng, E.L., Klasik, D., Loeb, S. (2010). Principal's time use and school effectiveness. American Journal of Education, 116(4), pp. 3-31. More specifically, she finds in a study with Jason Grissom and Benjamin Master, that if principals use their instructional time to coach teachers, evaluate performance and develop their schools' educational programmes, their instructional time tends to predict student achievement gains, whereas time spent on informal classroom walkthroughs has the opposite effect.Grissom J.A., Loeb, S., Master, B. (2013). Effective instructional time use for school leaders: Longitudinal evidence from observations of principals. Educational Researcher, 42(8), pp.433-444.Horng, E., Loeb, S. (2010). New thinking about instructional leadership. Phi Delta Kappa, 92(3), pp. 66-69. Moreover, only principals' organization management skills are found to consistently predict student achievement growth and other measures of school success.Grissom, J.A., Loeb, S. (2011). Triangulating principal effectiveness: How perspectives of parents, teachers, and assistant principals identify the central importance of managerial skills. American Educational Research Journal 48(5), pp. 1091-1123. In other research with Demetra Kalogrides and Tara B√©teille, Loeb observes that principal turnover generally decreases school performance by reducing teacher retention and depressing student achievement gains, with the effect being particularly pronounced in high-poverty or low-achieving schools as well as in schools with inexperienced teachers.B√©teille, T., Kalogrides, D., Loeb, S. (2012). Stepping stones: Principal career paths and school outcomes. Social Science Research, 41(4), pp. 904-919. Furthermore, principals with less experience as well as with less and lower-quality education tend to sort to schools serving many low-income, non-White, and low-achieving students, as high-quality principals tend to transfer away faster from such schools.Loeb, S., Kalogrides, D., Horng, E.L. (2010). Principal preferences and the uneven distribution of principals across schools. Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 32(2), pp. 205-229. Taking the perspective of schools, Loeb, Kalogrides and B√©teille find that more effective schools succeed in attracting and hiring more effective teachers from other schools, assign inexperienced teachers more equitably over grades, and are better at retaining high-quality teachers.Loeb, S., Kalogrides, D., B√©teille, T. (2012). Effective schools: Teacher hiring, assignment, development, and retention. Early Childhood Research Quarterly, 19(4), pp. 505-527. = Research on Head Start, school size, preschool childcare, and school accountability= Two topics that Loeb has researched with Valerie Lee are the fading effects of the Head Start Programme and the impact of school sizes. With regard to Head Start, they find that former attendees of Head Start tend to be educated in comparatively low- quality middle grade schools, which structurally undermined the long-term effects of participation in Head Start and partly explains why only little benefits were observed.Lee, V.E., Loeb, S. (1995). Where do Head Start attendees end up? One reason why preschool effects fade out. Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 17(1), pp. 62-82. Regarding the impact of school size, they observe that the attitudes of teachers regarding their responsibility for student learning benefit tend to be higher in smaller schools and - through this pathway - increase elementary school students' annual gains in mathematics achievement scores.Lee, V.E., Loeb, S. (2000). School size in Chicago elementary schools: Effects on teachers' attitudes and students' achievements. American Educational Research Journal, 37(1), pp. 3-31. In research with Martin Carnoy, Loeb finds that students in high- accountability states averaged significantly higher gains on the NAEP 8th- grade math tests compared to students in state with little or no external accountability, though there is no significant effect on student retention or high school completion rates.Carnoy, M., Loeb, S. (2002). Does External Accountability Affect Student Outcomes? A Cross-State Analysis. Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 24(4), pp. 305-331. Loeb extensively reviews the literature on school accountability in her corresponding article with David Figlio in the Handbook of the Economics of Education.Figlio, D., Loeb, S. (2011). School accountability. In: Hanushek, E.A., W√∂√ümann, L. (eds.). Handbook of the Economics of Education, vol. 4. Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 383-421. Finally, together with an eclectic range of co-authors, Loeb has analysed the effect of different types of childcare on children's development. In particular, Loeb finds that childcare in preschool centers raises reading and math scores but negatively affects socio-behavioural measures (except for English-proficient Hispanic children), with the duration of childcare, the age at which children start attending preschool centers (optimally at age 2-3), and the intensity of childcare all playing important roles regarding the overall effect.Loeb, S. et al. (2007). How much is too much? The influence of preschool centers on children's social and cognitive development. Economics of Education Review, 26(1), pp. 52-55. Moreover, center-based childcare programmes are found to increase the cognitive growth of children from poor families, especially if caregivers are more sensitive and responsive, improve their social development if caregivers are highly educated, and reduce behavioural problems compared to children in poor communities who receive family childcare.Loeb, S. et al. (2004). Child care in poor communities: Early learning effects of type, quality, and stability. Child Development, 75(1), pp. 47-65.

It usually has two leaves at its base and up to nine relatively small, whitish to mauve flowers with purple markings. It is an uncommon species found in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland. Description Diuris parvipetala is a tuberous, perennial herb with two linear leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Up to nine whitish to mauve flowers with purple markings and wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is angled upwards, long and about wide. The lateral sepals are long, about wide and turned downwards. The petals are oblong, long, wide and spread apart from each other on a purple-brown stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is spade-shaped, about long and wide with its tip turned downwards. The side lobes are about long and wide. There are between two thick, ridge-like calli long in the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from August to October. Taxonomy and naming The slender purple donkey orchid was first formally described in 1964 by Alick Dockrill who gave it the name Diuris punctata var. parvipetala. The description was published in The Victorian Naturalist from a specimen collected near Brigooda. In 1987 David Jones and Mark Clements raised it to species status as Diuris parvipetalum. The specific epithet (parvipetala) is derived from the Latin words parvus meaning \\"small\\" and petalum meaning \\"leaf\\". Distribution and habitat Diuris parvipetala grows with grasses and between rocks from about Mount Moffatt in Queensland to Emmaville in New South Wales.

Album release As the release of a tax scam label, the album came with minimal documentation. While all of the cover versions were credited to the correct songwriters, the original songs were all credited to Victor Lovera, a friend and collaborator of R.

It appears that the studio held onto copies of the recordings, which were in a style that was different from that dominating Nashville at the time and sold them to Guinness Records along with several cover versions of top 40 hits recorded by Audio Media employees for discount compilation albums, to recoup the recording costs. The two Lovera solo acoustic songs were recorded around two years prior to the Ethos songs at Tree Publishing, another Nashville area recording studio and were most likely provided to Guinness Records under similar circumstances to the other songs on the album.

The American 24-gun privateer Tartar captured Jane off the south coast of Haiti on 6 February 1782. Jane had been sailing between St Kitts and Jamaica when she sprang the head of her mainmast. She anchored in the lee of the √éle-√†-Vache to effect repairs. When Burr sighted a strange vessel he made sail, but his pursuer quickly caught up. Jane fired a broadside but two of her guns came off their carriages, and another came loose from its securing bolts. Water was also coming in through Janes gun ports. Unable to resist effectively, Burr struck. The subsequent court martial exonerated Burr for the loss of his ship. The court martial discovered that when Jane had been fitted out locally she had had to take whatever stores and equipment she could get. In particular, apparently her guns and their carriages were ancient and had been condemned.

He was also known as the first African American to run for mayor of a major US city, Jersey City, New Jersey. Early life In 1931, Givens was born in Jersey City. From 15 to 18 years old, he was stationed in the South Pacific. In 1952, he and Alma Montgomery married. They had two children, Kevin and Pamela. During the early 1960s, Givens owned his own home remodeling business. Career In 1961, Givens began his political career in the New Frontier Political Democratic Club, which began running African American political candidates. By 1963, Givens was president of the club and promised to run an African American for mayor of Jersey City in two years. In 1965, Givens ran for mayor of Jersey City. His campaign platform included federally-financed factories run by African Americans, history books reflecting a more accurate understanding of African American contributions, funds to rehabilitate neighborhoods and build middle-class cooperatives, and rent control. He came in sixth out of seven contenders. Givens committed his life to building anti- poverty organizations run by poor people like himself. He said, \\"One day when I was 13, I grew so sick of poverty that I cried. I vowed then the next generation would not endure what I had to suffer.\\" From 1964, he worked for CAN DO, an anti-poverty organization that trained teenage boys to do construction. Then, he formed Poverty Organization of Rehabilitation (POOR) and Grass Rooters Interested in Poverty Elimination (GRIPE). Givens became a leader in the Poor People's Campaign. Mayor John Lindsey appointed Givens New York coordinator of the campaign. During Resurrection City, a multiracial group, including Givens, decided that America‚Äôs poor needed its own ‚Äúembassy,‚Äù a Poor People's Embassy in Washington, DC. From this embassy, Givens launched the Poor People‚Äôs Development Foundation (PPDF), which sought to help poor communities develop cooperatives. From 1969, Givens was the president and the board included Chicano activist Reies Tijerina, native activist Tillie Walker, and Black Panther Mark Comfort. By 1971, PPDF worked on establishing farm cooperatives in the South and linking them to northern consumers, as well as supporting community control of urban renewal efforts in Chicago. The farm cooperatives formed in response to the backlash against the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Southern tenant farmers who decided to register to vote were, in retaliation, evicted from their tenant farms. Givens and PPDF worked to connect Southern farmers' cooperatives with consumer food cooperatives, farmers' markets, health food stores, and collective warehouses, which he set up around Newark, NJ and New York City. Members of the PPDF trucked food up to Newark and New York City to be sold in farmers' markets and health food stores. When Mayor Marion Barry was elected as mayor of Washington, DC, Givens moved to Washington, DC. By May 1980, Barry made Givens chairperson of his new Commission on Cooperative Economic Development, which aimed to make Washington, DC, a demonstration city for cooperative development. Givens envisioned cooperatives as a way to forge economic and political power among low- and moderate-income residents. Givens created an entire development model in which each community would have: 1) producer cooperatives (particularly important for job creation, 2) consumer cooperatives, 3) credit unions, 4) low-income housing cooperatives, and 5) a community cooperative funded by profits from the other cooperatives to develop social programs like schools, hospitals, and child development centers. He understood these cooperatives as necessarily working together. This model would also require assistance at the national level, such as from the National Cooperative Bank, which he helped form. In 1985, Givens told FBI agents about phony contracts that DC government employee Ivanhoe Donaldson had run through Givens' organization. Donaldson eventually was sentenced to seven years for his embezzlement and fined. Givens was never charged with any wrongdoing. Givens spent the rest of his life advocating for cooperatives. DC Mayor Sharon Pratt Dixon helped Givens establish the University of the District of Columbia's Center for Cooperatives.

She is a co-founder of the artist-run-space 5533, operating since 2008 in Istanbul Traders' Market Shopping Center.  Education  Nancy Atakan completed her undergraduate education in Studio Art and Art History in 1968 at the University of Mary Washington and moved to Istanbul in 1969. She completed her PhD titled \\"Conceptual Art in Turkey\\" under the supervision of Zeynep Inankur at Mimar Sinan University in 1994. She taught Art History at Robert College (1983‚Äì1997) and History of European Painting and Sculpture at Bosphorus University (1996‚Äì2000). In 2007 she participated at a residency at the Banff Centre in Alberta, Canada and in 2017 to the Nordic Art Association's (NFK) Residency program with the support of IASPIS.  Work  Having studied painting, Nancy Atakan produces drawings, paintings, videos, installations, photography and needlework, using personal archival materials and exploring the relationship between text and image. Starting from the 1990s, Atakan emphasized the importance of collaboration in her work and defined her approach as \\"art as dialogue\\". In the late 1990s she produced independent exhibitions in collaboration with G√ºl√ßin Aksoy, Gul Ilgaz and Neriman Polat, the first of which, titled \\"Arada\\" (\\"In Between\\") took place in 1997 at Atat√ºrk Cultural Center in Istanbul. Starting from 2000 she also collaborated with the artists from Hafriyat collective in producing several exhibitions in Istanbul: \\"Local Produce\\", 2000, Elhamra Passage; \\"Voices From Homeland\\", 2001, Karsi Sanat and \\"Families Only\\", 2003, Karsi Sanat. In 2008 when she co-founded the artist- run-space 5533 with Volkan Aslan, she considered this to be a continuation of her practice in the form of \\"art as dialogue\\". In the framework of 5533 Nancy Atakan and Volkan Aslan have shaped a programming with the participation of artists and curators such as Adnan Yƒ±ldƒ±z, Ahmet √ñƒü√ºt, Anna Eriksson, Asena G√ºnal, Banu Cennetoƒülu, CANAN, Cevdet Erek, Can Altay, Fulya Erdemci, Hale Tenger, Ipek Duben, Inci Eviner, Mari Spirito, Marcus Graf, √ñv√ºl Durmu≈üoƒülu and Pelin Tan. 5533 was the subject of an archival exhibition held at New York's ISCP (International Studio and Curatorial Program) in 2018 featuring documentation, new works and a series of talks. In 2016, the first monograph focusing on Nancy Atakan's works, titled Passing On was published by Kehrer Verlag. Edited by Nat Muller, the publication included contributions by Ye≈üim Turanlƒ±, Nat M√ºller, Wendy Shaw and Merve √únsal. The book focuses on Nancy Atakan's latest works dealing with female lineage and intergenerational transmission, with a focus on how women's public and private roles were shaped and transformed during the transition from Ottoman Empire to Turkish Republic, and how this transformation affected intimacy.  Exhibitions  Nancy Atakan's works have been presented in exhibitions in the following institutions: Weserburg, Elgiz Museum, Istanbul Modern, Akademie der Kunste, DEPO Istanbul, Apartment Project, Middle East Technical University, CerModern, , Museum of Contemporary Art Copenhagen and Banff Center among others.

It is based on the 1963 novel Psyche '59 by Fran√ßoise des Ligneris. The film stars Patricia Neal, Curd J√ºrgens, Samantha Eggar, Ian Bannen, Beatrix Lehmann and Elspeth March. The film was released on 29 April 1964, by Columbia Pictures. Plot Alison is apparently happy as a wife and the mother of two daughters despite her blindness, caused by a fall during pregnancy. She is helped by her devoted husband, Eric, a London businessman, an elderly French maid, and Paul, a close family friend. Then Alison's younger sister, Robin, returns. Robin takes Alison shopping and suggests she see a specialist about her eyes. Alison says it is not her eyes that are faulty but her brain. A doctor has told her that her mind has seen something it did not like and now refuses to see at all. In the family's town house Robin is very flirty and appears to mean to seduce or somehow punish Eric. She even jokes about this in front of Alison and Eric. Eric is furious and grabs her by the hair at the back of her head. But Robin stabs him with sewing scissors. Alison cannot see this but knows the mood has changed and asks what Robin is wearing. When her sister does not answer she touches her knee and feels the skimpy nightdress and leaves the room. Later, Alison tells Robin she sometimes thinks she may recall the event that caused her sight loss. She woke in the night, knowing she was about to give birth to her second child. Her husband was not with her. She left the bedroom and heard Robin crying. After this, she had a fall, but cannot remember anything else till waking in hospital. Alison and Robin go to the family's country house to supervise repairs that their mother has cancelled. The mother reveals that as children Alison used to take the things Robin held dear. She tells Alison to remember who introduced her to Eric. Alison retorts that it was \\"just an adolescent crush\\", implying that Robin had liked Eric first. In town, Eric has dinner with Paul at a restaurant, and Paul says he likes Robin. He then implies Eric has had an affair with a Spanish woman. This is dismissed by Eric: \\"That's over. Anyway, she was Peruvian...don't talk about women as if they were wine. It is a sign of youth.\\" They agree to drive to the country to surprise Alison and Robin. On the drive down Eric suggests Paul might win Robin over by beating her and using a belt on her. \\"Then when she has had enough, make love to her.\\" Paul guesses that Eric has been Robin's lover in the past. Eric says she was 17 and living with them on holidays from boarding school. Paul says she must have seen Eric as a father figure as she never knew her own father. Eric says he saw her grow up and creepily adds that he saw the \\"apples filling out\\". Paul says he then \\"plucked the fruits\\". Paul seems worried and says \\"what really happened?\\" Eric says \\"ask her.\\" On a beach we find out that Robin has been married and has left her husband in the U.S. Her mother thinks she now has gigolos, and we see her flirting with two young men on the beach. Alison defends her by saying they are just young men with little money. In another scene, Alison asks Robin if she was in love with Eric and Robin says unexpectedly \\"I hated him.\\" She explains this as the fact that Eric was taking her sister away from her by marrying her. Alison says Robin had everything as a child and was ravishing as a girl; Robin asks her \\"you never knew how your ravishing sister was ravished on your wedding night, did you?\\" This was a middle-aged man she met on the beach. She says she cried and wanted to tell Alison all about it but couldn't. The two men arrive at the country house. Robin causes a scene stealing black currants with the children. Eric is cross with her, but Alison defends her saying she has been troubled. Later, Paul and Robin share a picnic and kiss. He asks why she won't marry him, and she says he does not love her. She describes intense desire, and Paul asks if that is how she wants Eric. Robin does not answer but says she worshiped him and he \\"took pity on me and gave me a crumb\\". But clearly she is messed up by this, so it was not, as she puts it (sarcastically?) \\"kind\\". Paul finds Alison smoking in the garden that night. He asks her advice on his relationship with Robin, and Alison suggests he cuts himself free, or love can be \\"like committing suicide\\". Next day in the kitchen, Alison is chopping vegetables. Robin thinks Eric and Paul should not be out together. She says Eric thinks all women are \\"bitches or objects of pity - like you\\". Alison cuts her finger and sucks it. Robin adds \\"he likes you blind. It's the only way you can hold him.\\" Alison grapples with Robin, who then flees. Eric comes in and offers to take Alison away, but Alison says she won't run away. Robin has taken a horse and is trying to leave, but the household surrounds her. The horse clips Alison, who falls, but from the grass, she tells a concerned Eric that she is alright. The horse then runs into bushes and Robin falls off. She appears unconscious, and Eric carries her into the house. Eric lays Robin on a bed, and Robin comes round. He has his hands on her shoulders and her neck. She starts to cry. Alison comes into the house downstairs, rubbing her eyes. She hears crying like she heard years ago. She sees her memory: her sister and Eric in bed and Eric telling her to go to America while Robin begs not to be sent away. Their upper bodies are clearly naked. In the present, Alison is still wearing her dark glasses but can see her hands. She goes to the door of the bedroom and sees a blurred shape of Eric, who sat on the bed above her sister. The mother comes upstairs and tells Alison to lie down, but Alison says \\"leave me alone\\". In the bedroom, Eric embraces Robin's body, and Robin kisses the palm of his hand. Then she comes to her senses and pushes him away saying she won't be second best. She suggests he leave Alison and the children but clearly doubts that he will. Alison overhears and goes to her own bedroom. Eric is furious with Robin's challenge to him and starts to strangle her. He releases her, and she laughs at him and then turns away and cries as he runs out of the room. Alison can see her children in the garden and is crying. After a possible attempt to seduce Eric that evening, she gets into bed sadly. The next day, she is arranging phenobarbitone tablets on the table to form a letter 'A'. The others play tennis outside. A taxi arrives to take the children to see their cousins. Alison says goodbye. Her mother suspects something, and won't let Alison return upstairs, saying lunch is nearly ready. She reads a sci-fi book out loud while Alison knits. Eventually, Alison says she's had enough and goes to her room. Everyone meets for lunch, including Alison, but Robin is late. She arrives with a bunch of roses which she places on Alison's lap, then says \\"happy anniversary.\\" Paul expresses surprise, and Robin says Eric didn't let him know because Eric has forgotten the anniversary. She then sits on Paul's knee and says they are getting married. Everyone is tense. Robin walks over to Eric and says \\"aren't you going to kiss the bride?\\" He seizes her around the waist and buries his head in her stomach. He is crying. Paul walks out. Robin looks over her shoulder toward her sister, and both she and Eric see that Alison can see them. Her face is full of shock and distress. Alison walks into the garden after Paul, and then smiles at the sky and the sunlight.

He revived the company after a period of decline, moving away from the stiff Empire style of previous decades in favour of a more Impressionist style which combined underglaze painting techniques with inspiration from Japanese imagery and European naturalism. He designed the Polar Bear Fountain for the Peace Palace in The Hague. He has also designed furniture and silverware and took up landscape painting after his retirement from the porcelain factory in 1916. Early life and education Self-portrait by Arnold Krog Krog was born in Frederiksv√¶rk, the son of inspector at Frederiksv√¶rk Iron Works Hans Jacob Gr√∏gaard Krog (1822‚Äì88) and Jenny Meyer (1824‚Äì1905). He graduated from Eftersl√¶gtselskabets Skole in 1873. He then apprenticed as a mason for half a year C. Wienberg and studied drawing under C. V. Nielsen. He enrolled at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts' School of Architecture in October 1874, graduating in 1880. In 1877‚Äì78, together with Martin Nyrop, Hack Kampmann and Martin Borch, he contributed to Hans J. Holm's Surveying of Kronborg Castle. He studied Majolica ceramics on a journey to Italy in 1877‚Äì83. He also worked as a draftsman for Ludvig Fenger and contributed to Ferdinand Meldahl and Heinrich Hansen's interior restoration of Frederiksborg Castle and received attention for his Moorish Hall at the Panopticon Building in Copenhagen. Sigurd Schultz: Royal Copenhagen Krog's Polar Bear Fountain in front of the Peace Palace in the Hague. After Aluminia's acquisition of the Royal Copenhagen Porcelain Manufactury in 1882, its director, Philip Schou (1838-1922), was looking for someone who could revive the stagnating company artistically. In 1884 he asked the xylograher Frederik Hendriksen for advice on the matter and he proposed Krog as a possible candidate for the job. Krog was hired on a trial basis in October 1884 and was appointed to artistic director of the company on a permanent basis in January 1885. Krog introduced a new style with inspiration from Japanese porcelain and nature. His achievements won recognition at the Nordic Exhibition of 1888 in Copenhagen and international attention at the 1891 General Land Centennial Exhibition in Paris where the company won the grand prix. It was also for the Nordic Exhibition 1888 that Arnold Krog introduced the first underglazed memorial plate from Royal Copenhagen, which would become the inspiration for the later Danish Christmas plates. Furniture , and silver Krog has also designed silver, for instance for A. Michelsen. He has also designed furniture and bookbinding. Memberships and awards He became a member of the Academy's plenary session in 1911 and he was a member of the academy council from February 1911 to February 1919. He was appointed Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog in 1890 and a titular professor in 1892. Painting Late in his life, he took up landscape painting and etching. He held a solo exhibitions at Kleis' gallery in √òstergade in 1919 and 1923. He was represented at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1887, 1891, 1916, 1919‚Äì21 and 1923. Personal life Krog was married to Euphemia Magdalene Henningsen on 8 September 1882 in Hvedstrup Church. She was a sister of the painters Frants Henningsen and Erik Henningsen.

Risley in their book Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children, and subsequently reprinted in the article \\"The Early Catastrophe: The 30 Million Word Gap by Age 3\\". In their study of 42 Midwestern families, Hart and Risley physically recorded an hour's worth of language in each home once a month over 2¬Ω years. Families were classified by socioeconomic status (SES) into \\"high\\" (professional), \\"middle/low\\" (working class) and \\"welfare\\" SES. They found that the average child in a professional family hears 2,153 words per waking hour, the average child in a working-class family hears 1,251 words per hour, and an average child in a welfare family only 616 words per hour. Extrapolating, they stated that, \\"in four years, an average child in a professional family would accumulate experience with almost 45 million words, an average child in a working-class family 26 million words, and an average child in a welfare family 13 million words.\\" The authors found a correlation between word exposure and the rate of vocabulary acquisition in the subject children. The recordings showed that high-SES toddlers spoke approximately two new words a day between their second and third birthdays, middle-/low-SES children one word per day, and welfare SES children 0.5 words per day. Spoken words are a measure of productive vocabulary. It is thought that during children's vocabulary development the productive vocabulary mirrors their underlying receptive vocabulary growth. The authors and subsequent researchers have posited that the word gap‚Äîor certainly the differing rates of vocabulary acquisition‚Äîpartially explains the achievement gap in the United States, the persistent disparity in educational performance among subgroups of U.S. students, especially subgroups defined by socioeconomic status and race.  History of language gap research  = Before Hart & Risley = Prior to the 30-million-word-gap study, extensive research had noted strong institutional variation in student success on standardized tests. The initial attention to achievement gap started with a 1966 publication from the U.S. Department of Education titled \\"Equality of Educational Opportunity.\\" The publication begins the onset of achievement gap by acknowledging that there is a great disparity within educational outcomes as a result of inequitable institutions, especially those that were not seen as part of the purview of schools such as cultural, socioeconomic, and linguistic realities of students at home. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) had further been used to census information that various studies used to show achievement gaps across a number of demographics. The idea of equity in education had also given rise to similar gap discourse around the world. = Hart & Risley's contribution = Hart and Risley (2003) spent 2¬Ω years observing 42 families for an hour each month to learn what typical home life was like for 1- and 2-year-old children. The families were grouped into 4 variables, upper SES, middle SES, lower SES and just a few that were on welfare. The middle- and low-SES families were grouped in the final analysis. They found that by age 3 children in welfare families had a vocabulary of 525 words where children in upper-SES families had vocabulary of 1,116 words. They also found that the children in upper- class families were learning vocabulary at a faster rate. The researchers suggested the reason for this difference is because the welfare children heard on average 616 words per hour where professional-family children heard on average 2,153 words per hour. Thus, proposing the 30-million-word gap. The achievement gap is explained as a result of the language gap, in that because children are lacking in their vocabulary and literary skills, they will not be as successful in academics. Hart and Risley argue this is an indispensable societal concern because it sets the child at a disadvantage for not being exposed to more vocabulary skills at a young age. = Socioeconomic status studies = Fernald, Marchman, and Weisleder (2013) conducted a study with 48 children from diverse backgrounds ages 18‚Äì24 months old. The families were divided into low SES (socioeconomic status) and high SES. Their first goal was to track developmental changes in processing efficiency in relation to vocabulary learning. Their second goal was to examine difference in aspects of early language development in relation to their SES. Their results showed that children at the same age from the lower-class families had lower vocabulary scores when compared to children in higher class families. Fernald et al. (2013) also found that by 18 months old language processing and vocabulary disparities were already evident, and by 24 months old there was a 6-month gap between the SES groups in processing skills critical to language development. Fernald et al. found fast reaction time as a child can translate into reaction time as an adult. Adults who have high reaction time tend to have better memories, reasoning abilities, language skills and are better able to learn new skills (fluid intelligence). Having better processing speed means having a stronger working memory, and a stronger working memory leads to a better cognitive competence. The authors express the importance of vocabulary knowledge because it sets a foundation for later literacy and language proficiency in preschool and that is predictive of academic success. Implications of long term developmental trajectories. Thus, the issue of the language gap and achievement gap are prevalent in our youth, which can be resolved by teaching families how to work and speak with their children. = Educational system studies = Sperry, Sperry, and Miller (2018) replicated Hart and Risley's study and found that the number of word gaps varied within the same backgrounds of socio-economic status. A longitudinal study observed families with their children in their homes and the researchers spoke to the participants as if they were a family friend. They used similar social classes as HR for comparison. Middle class, working class, lower class, poor \\"welfare\\" group. During the visit, three analyses were made and transcribed for research. The first was how many words the primary caregiver spoke to the child. The second was that the words spoken by all caregivers to the child showed social class alone did not determine either the composition of households or consequently the amount of a speech a child heard. Lastly, all ambient speech, like language addressed to other individuals but overheard by language learning children was considered. In the poor community sample when you took into consideration the ambient speech, or the words that primary caregivers said to extended family, the number of words a child hears increased by 54%, in the working class by 210%. This study was the first attempt to replicate Hart and Risley and their findings did not support the previous claims. Given the variation within communities was greater than when simply comparing socioeconomic statuses. Garcia and Otheguy (2016) were interested in the origins and validity of the Language Gap, and how the preconceptions of it impact bilingual and bidialectical children, specifically from Latino and Black backgrounds. They focused more so on how people talk about and understand language as a whole, especially within the education system. Their argument claims language is a semiotic process that involves sound, touch, and gestures and should be seen as a translanguaging-internalist perspective. She offers historical context to give insight to the creation of the Language Gap and the biases it may hold. They suggest it began when Brown vs The Board of Education (1954) and the Civil Rights Act (1964) made it illegal to judge based on one's color or race; thus, exclusions needed to be made based on another trait. They build on Flores and Rosas' (2017) idea of raciolinguistics that suggests a new way to separate whites and non-whites. They continue to give historical context on the Achievement Gap in that it was a result of the No Child Left Behind Act (2001), despite its good intentions, it compared every race and background on a standardized test written in a White monolingual way. Given the educational system functions on the dominant groups of society (i.e. white, Standardized English, middle-upper class), it ignores the linguistic and cultural practices of minorities. The theory here is that it is not that families of differing backgrounds are not adequate in teaching their children how to speak, but teach them a different linguistic culture at home than the one taught in schools. Similarly, Johnson (2015) draws on from Faltis (2006) socialization mismatch hypothesis that the culture of the schooling system that is based around middle to upper class, White, Standardized English principles do not match the language socialization of backgrounds that may not fit into these categories.Faltis, C.F. (2005), Teaching English Language Learners in Elementary School Communities , Pearson, London. He argues the Language Gap was not a result of vocabulary or literary deficiency in a child, but rather not understanding the language socialization of different cultural backgrounds. He drew from a previous linguistic anthropologist Hymes (1972) term of \\"communicative competence\\" in that social expectations within a speech community shape the member's use of language.Hymes, D. (1972), ‚ÄúOn communicative competence‚Äù, in Pride, J.B. and Holmes, J. (Eds),Sociolinguistics , Penguin, London, pp. 269-285. Thus, diverse backgrounds in language have a different set of expectations that a member conforms to. As language differs, so does the developmental process. Johnson (2015) argues the Language Gap is not fair because it does not consider the various ways children use words and create meaning. Therefore, it is not the parents at fault leading their children to fall behind, but the school's fault for not accommodating to children's backgrounds.Thus, the Language Gap is not a result of a child's capabilities to understand, but a result of how a linear function of language ignores the needs of the various ways to make meaning.  Criticisms  Hart and Risley's research has been criticised by scholars. Paul Nation criticises the methodology, noting that comparing the tokens (words produced) and number of types (number of different words) in unequal samples is not comparing vocabulary sizes. This is to say that the high socio-economic status samples naturally had a greater number of word types due to the greater number of tokens, because Hart and Risley extrapolated from tokens to an assumed greater number of types, but did not individually assess the number of types. The vocabulary sizes were cumulative, when it is possible that some new words produced were words that had been learnt in a previous month. In fact, Hart and Risley found no major differences in the quality of language produced between the different socio- economic groups. Other critics theorize that the language and achievement gaps are not a result of the amount of words a child is exposed to, but rather alternative theories suggest it could derive from the disconnect of linguistic practices between home and school. Thus, judging academic success and linguistic capabilities from socioeconomic status may ignore bigger societal issues. The ongoing word gap discourse can be seen as a modern movement in educational discussion. A recent replication of Hart and Risley's study with more participants and more has found that the \\"word gap\\" may be closer to 4 million words, not the oft-cited 30 million words previously proposed. Hart and Risley's research has also been criticised for its racial bias, with the majority of the welfare families and working-class families being African American.  Implications  = Social implications = There are possible social implications to Hart and Risley's theories of the issue of the Language Gap in society. The first possible implication is that this Language Gap is affecting youth's success because they are not exposed to the same amount of vocabulary and literary skill as other kids from middle-upper classes. Hart and Risely suggest that possible solutions include interventions on how to improve vocab and literary skills for caregivers in low SES. However, the second possible implication of this theory is that it ignores the fact that language and culture are taught differently. In stating other backgrounds cannot be as successful as the dominant groups in society, It reinstates the homogeneity of language, in that it proposes one \\"true\\" way of speaking. Garcia and Otheguy (2016) implies the Language and Achievement Gap derive from racist ideals that reinforce the idea that some cultures are seen as \\"disadvantaged\\". To place the blame on different backgrounds is to invalidate their way to make meaning just because they have different cultures. Thus, to not consider the responsibility of the schooling system is to promote the homogeneity of Standardized English and this notion that anyone who does not speak or understand it is inferior and prone to future failure. Garcia argues it deligitimatizes backgrounds of families and their linguistic and cultural practices because it is not seen to be \\"successful\\" in the eyes of the education system. = Political implications = Sperry, Sperry and Miller discussed some of the consequences of the original Hart and Risley (2003) article. The 30-million-word gap has received widespread media attention. In 2013 Bloomberg Philanthropies mayors challenge awarded providence Rhode Island its grand prize to \\"providence talks\\"‚Äîa project proposed to teach poor parents how to speak to their children with the aid of the LENA Device. The Clinton foundations \\"Too Small to Fail\\" initiative which hosted the White House Word Gap event in 2014, resulted in the US department of Health and Human services funding remedial efforts to address the Word Gap. In addition, Georgia has a policy \\"Talk with Me Baby\\" that is a public action strategy aimed at increasing the number of words children are exposed to in early childhood. \\"Talk With Me Baby\\" is a program that provides professional development of nurses, who will then coach new parents how they should talk to their children. This program is funded by Greater United Way of Atlanta. The University of Chicago, School of Medicine's Thirty Million Words Initiative provides intervention for caregivers and teaches to show them how to optimize their talk with their kids. This program is funded by the PNC Foundation.Shankar, M. (2014) Empowering our children by bridging the word gap. The White House President Barack Obama retrieved from: https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2014/06/25/empowering-our-children- bridging-word-gap = Gap discourse = The Word Gap theory can be seen as part of a larger development in modern educational reform and movement: the Achievement Gap discourse. It is widely accepted and noted by scholars that ideas around individual outcome in schools varies based on various demographics. Explaining variations in achievement in schools across levels of demographics that may result in a gap in student achievement has become the primary problems public schools have to address. The Discourse is based on evidence and assumptions of why primarily poor students of color do not perform at the same levels as their more affluent White and certain Asian group counterparts‚Äîit creates language to how schools and communities can be organized more optimally to help students and schools produce more equitable and successful outcomes. The Achievement Gap also addresses a gender gap achievement, and standardized test score gaps broadly across countries, notably with standardized examinations on STEM subjects. The Discourse can also be seen as a turning away from traditional explanations of performance in school as individualistic, to the creation of cultural framework understanding to help explain what conventions hinder and produce successful students. Under performing, adequate yearly progress (AYP), highly qualified, below basic, and proficient are some terms used to mark good and bad aspects of schools, their teachers, and their students which in turn reifies the Achievement Gap theory. As a broader Discourse, it is an idea which is multimodally shared and accepted as common belief between parents, policy makers, teachers and students through various means according to James Paul Gee's idea of Discourse in socio-linguistic analysis. The effects of the Achievement Gap Discourse cause several cultural phenomena‚Äî\\"cultural gate-keeping,\\" in which policy makers and education reformers decide and label students as more or less capable and worthy than others. Schools might be called under-performing, which can further affect the policy and financing prescribed by their districts, or even higher authorities. Using metric standards to understand the cause in Achievement Gap as a result of ineffective cultural practices also tends to place blame on the families unless there is ample socio- linguistic inquiry to individual family circumstance, which still often creates a Discourse against deemed underachieving students' culture. The Achievement Gap Discourse initiated with two primary modes in American educational studies: Achievement Gap among races, and gap among socioeconomic status (SES). The gap Discourse does not typically extend across generations or other forms of demographics that have been studied, and further study of Achievement Gap among different dimensions faces the initial stigmatization as a result of the gap Discourse in various studies around the turn of the 21st century, pin-headed by the 30-million-word gap. Among critics are many linguists, anthropologists, and social discipline specialists, as well as organizations such as the Linguistic Society of America. The achievement gap became an especially strong interest for study in the turn of the century, and the early 2000s when a plethora of studies looked at factors such as standardized test scores, presence in class, GPA, enrollment, and dropout rates in secondary and post-secondary education. The problem came in the analyses of the studies which were criticized for looking at race and socioeconomic explanations to explain educational outcome without taking into account others such as S. J. Lee, 2005, Pang, Kiang, & Pak, 2004, and Rothstein 2004 which provided broad postulations as to why race and SES accounted for varied success.Pang, V. O., Kiang, P. N., & Pak, Y. K. (2004). Asian Pacific American students: Challenging a biased educational system. In J. A. Banks & C. A. M. Banks (Eds.), Handbook of research on multicultural education (2nd ed., pp. 542-563). San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.Perry, T. (2003). Up from the parched earth: Toward a theory of African American achievement. In T. Perry, C. Steele, & A. G. Hilliard III (Eds.), Young, gifted and Black: Promoting high achievement among African-American students (pp. 1-108). Boston, MA: Beacon Press.Lee, S. J. (2005). Up against whiteness: Race, school and immigrant youth. New York, NY: Teachers College Press. President George W. Bush's administration's No Child Left Behind rhetoric of 2001 and 2002 left researchers limited to the type of research they could conduct for educational equity due to a need to appease policy makers among educational stakeholders. According to Roderick L Carey, Word Gap researcher, the NCLB \\"mandated objective and quantitative ‚Äòscientifically based' research, which left little room for qualitative research agendas that unpack contextual factors that add nuance to the understandings of how high-stakes accountability is felt and lived by students, teachers, and their families.\\" The rhetoric also posed ideas that placed responsibility of achievement in institutions on their most proximal function oriented members, shifting responsibility to achieve positive outcomes on high-stakes standardized tests nearly entirely on teachers and schools, whilst the difference in achievement was largely believed to be due to factors outside of the classroom. Various studies culminated to suggest general and vague underlying problems within specific communities which caused deficit in learning outcomes under this context. Among these studies, Hart and Risley stumbled upon the idea of word gap when working with youth who used cochlear implants, to form their idea: they hypothesized exposure to spoken word might explain an achievement gap in standardized test scores, then used standardized testing data on language as well as an in depth study to conclude their 30-million-word-gap publication.  Additional information  = Word Gap internationally = The Oxford Word Gap is used to describe the word gap found between races and socioeconomic classes in the United Kingdom. The report study \\"Why Closing the Word Gap Matters: Oxford Language Report\\" details out statistics collected in primary and secondary schools in the United Kingdom, along the same ideas as the American Word Gap idea, citing Hart and Risley (2003) in the report. It was published in 2018, so all of its implications are yet to be seen. A great number of states have paid attention to Achievement Gap across hundreds of criteria including demographics, access to language and economic resources and race around the world: notably in the United Kingdom, France, South Africa as named in one comparative analysis. UNESCO has held strongly in its principles the importance on aspects of educational equity, and other educational movements similar to that of the United States Word Gap are numerous throughout Europe and some other members of UNESCO. Europe also has its own varied standards on the ideas of multilingual competence per state, which stress the apprehension and exposure to secondary language vocabulary in students of all ages. =Other word gaps= The word gap has largely been defined to mean the idea of the observed gap between the spoken and read language in the specific context of American education reform in the context of Hart and Risley; however, other proposed ideas or active research have used it to describe differences in access to language varieties experienced in public settings, such as signage in Orellana, 2017's Another Type of Word Gap, as well as other linguistic resources such as using media for language acquisition.Orellana, M.

Early years (1846‚Äì98) Marius Giacobbi was born on 14 September 1846 in Lugo-de-Venaco (Venaco), Corsica. His parents were Giuseppe Maria Giacobbi (1803‚Äì1870), an advocate and historian, and Elise Annonciade Angeli (1821‚Äì1890). Giacobbi became mayor of Venaco and then general councillor for Venaco. On 25 March 1895 he married Marie Appolonie Stefani (born 1873) in Venaco. Their son Paul Joseph Marie Giacobbi(fr) was born on 18 March 1896 in Venaco. His other children included Fran√ßois Marie Charles Formose de Lugo Giacobbi (born 1897) and Faustine Giacobbi. First term as deputy (1898‚Äì1903) On 8 May 1898 Giacobbi ran for election as deputy of Corte against the incumbent Luce de Casabianca(fr). Both were Republican, but Giacobbi was further to the left. He won in the first round by 6,841 votes against 4,781 for Casabianca. The election was contested, but was eventually admitted. Giacobbi sat on the committees for the colonies, navigation and fishing, and in 1899 was a member of the committee on administrative economies. He did not often speak in public. He was reelected on 27 April 1902 by a clear margin. Senator (1903‚Äì12) Giacobbi ran for election to the Senate in the triennial renewal of 4 January 1903 and was elected by 643 out of 774 voters. He sat with the democratic left. As in the chamber of deputies, he was more active in committees than in debates. He was a member of the committees on the colonies and the navy. He ran for reelection to the senate on 7 January 1912 but was defeated, with only 211 out of 776 votes. Second term as deputy (1914‚Äì19) On 26 April 1914 Giacobbi again ran for election to the legislature. He obtained 4,258 out of 9,970 votes in the first round, then on 10 May 1914 won 5,773 votes to 4,934 for his opponent Benedetti. In the chamber his main effort was in the navy committee, but he was also a member of the social insurance committee, and after World War I (1914‚Äì18) of the committee on liberated regions. He suffered from illness throughout this last legislature and was often forced to take leave from the chamber. Marius Giacobbi died on 11 December 1919 in his home town of Venaco at the age of 73. Venaco had a mayor named Giacobbi for 120 years from 1878, with an interlude between 1919 and 1922, including Marius, his son, grandson and great grandson. Marius Giacobbi's son Paul Giacobbi was a minister several times during the French Fourth Republic. Paul's son Fran√ßois Giacobbi was a deputy, senator and under-secretary of state. His son, Paul Giacobbi, was also a deputy until 2017.

The next year, President Lee Teng-hui nominated Yeh to the Control Yuan. In 1997, Yeh helped Hou You-yi and Frank Hsieh resolve the Alexander family hostage crisis. Yeh left the Control Yuan in 1999. He called for either President Chen Shui-bian or Premier Chang Chun-hsiung to resign in January 2001, as the Executive Yuan had issued an order to end work on the Longmen Nuclear Power Plant without consulting the legislature. Yeh ran as an independent in the legislative elections of 2001, and was defeated. Yeh then invested in Tsingtao Beer. In March 2004, Yeh faced Lo Chih-ming in debates about the cross-strait referendum to be held later that month. In October 2004, Yeh was named to a committee convened to investigate the 3-19 shooting incident. After the Judicial Yuan ruled to reduce the committee's powers in December, Yeh stated that \\"justice was interfering with the legislature.\\" He was elected to the National Assembly as a representative of the People First Party in 2005, and subsequently granted a seat on the presidium of its fourth convocation. Yeh later became a political commentator. The Kuomintang nominated Yeh to a second term on the Control Yuan in March 2007. He was renominated in September 2008, after the Ma Ying-jeou administration took office, and confirmed in November 2008. In 2009, Yeh co-wrote impeachment charges against Lin Ling-san, voted to censure the Ministry of National Defense over its handling of Justin Yifu Lin's 1979 defection, and took lead roles investigating Taiwan High Speed Rail and damage from Typhoon Morakot. In 2011, Yeh accepted a petition from the Public Television Service against the Government Information Office. He also participated on reviews of martial law, as well as probes of alleged corruption within Taipei City Government regarding the Xinsheng Overpass project and the International Flora Exposition. In February 2012, Yeh and the Judicial Yuan began investigating Tsai Ing-wen's ties to the former Yu Chang Biologics Company. Though the Judicial Yuan ended its involvement that August, Yeh's probe continued, aided by colleagues and Ma Hsiu-ru. As the Yu Chang case was pending, Yeh turned his attention to Lin Hsi-shan's investments, resulting in his impeachment. Yeh next participated in impeachment proceedings against Taipower executives, then reviewed housing restrictions placed on people accused of crimes. In August 2012, Yeh himself was investigated by the Special Investigation Division of the Ministry of Justice. Later that year, Yeh received a petition to review the death penalty. In February 2013, he announced the Control Yuan's decision to censure the Ministry of Economic Affairs for its failure to review contracts signed by China Steel, which led to Lin Yi-shih facing accusations of bribery. The Control Yuan issued a verdict on the Yu Chang case in October 2013, deciding to censure Tsai Ing- wen.

Made of a gold, copper and silver alloy, it was cast via the lost-wax process; the tongue, cast individually, can be retracted or extended, and swings from side to side with its wearer's movement. The serpent is thought to represent Xiuhcoatl. The labret entered the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art with a 2016 purchase, and is considered \\"perhaps the finest Aztec gold ornament to survive the crucibles of the sixteenth century\\". Description Codex Ixtlilxochitl depicts an Aztec warrior with a labret The labret, which was worn in a piercing below the lower lip, is high, wide, deep, and weighs . It was cast via the lost-wax process, and is made of an alloy comprising 59.3 to 64.3% gold, 26.8 to 33.1% copper, and 7.5 to 8.8% silver. The tongue was cast as a separate piece, allowing it to be retracted or extended, and for it to swing from side to side with the movement of its wearer. The serpent is attached to a cylindrical plug, which has a wide and plain flange to hold the labret in place within the wearer's mouth. The piece is shaped like a serpent preparing to strike, with a curled eyebrow and snout, serrated teeth, and two fangs. Scales are represented below the lower jaw. Provenance The labret is in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, which purchased the piece in 2016. Previously it had been owned by Heath McClung Steele from 1937 to 1949, and then by his children until 1978. After being sold at Sotheby's in New York on 22 November 1978 it passed into the collection of Jay C. Leff until 1981, and subsequently the collections of Judith Small Nash and Peter G. Wray, the latter of whom held the labret until 1985. It was next owned by Herbert L. Lucas, through 2004, and then became part of a private New York collection until its sale to the Met.

Former Minister BEBOARIMISA Ralava studied finance and international relationship. He acquired his first professional experiences in investment banks in France before returning to Madagascar in 2011. He then held the post of Executive Director of the Foundation for Protected Areas and Biodiversity of Madagascar for 4 years (FAPBM). FAPBM is one of the largest environmental foundation in Africa and also founding member of the Consortium of African Funds for Environment (CAFE) that BEBOARIMISA Ralava chaired. During his contract with FAPBM, Madagascar was particularly highlighted internationally as FAPBM led a delegation of more than 60 people from many environmental associations, NGOs and communities at the IUCN World Parks Congress 2014 in Sydney Australia. One of the biggest problems Beboarimisa faced during his tenure as minister of the environment was the rapid deforestation and threat to the flora and fauna of the island that Madagascar is undergoing. The first law he helped pass was the so-called \\"Beboarimisa law\\", which toughened sanctions for cutting down redwoods in Madagascar. Beboarimisa's hard tactics toward combating deforestation made him a popular figure in the country, and for a brief period of time it was rumored that he might succeed Jean Ravelonarivo as the next prime minister. However, Beboarimisa ended up losing his job in April 2016 after more than 1,000 tons of redwood were discovered in the possession of a Hong Kong businessman in Singapore, leading to questions of how such a large amount could have been smuggled out of the country.

It is individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a contributing property to the Aberdeen Commercial Historic District. History Detail of entrance in 2007 Businessman Alonzo Ward first built a hotel on the site in 1894. In November 1926, this first structure was destroyed in a fire. Work began on a replacement building in 1927 with the new hotel opening in May 1928. The first radio station in Aberdeen, KABR, began operations on the sixth floor in 1935. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 17, 1982. The building is also listed on the National Register as a key contributing property of the Aberdeen Commercial Historic District; the district was listed on May 23, 1988. From 2002 through 2004, 90 of the original hotel rooms on floors 3‚Äì6 were converted into 15 condominiums and the second-floor ballroom was restored. In mid-2017, however, plans were made to convert the ballroom into apartments because it was used too infrequently to be economically viable. In October 2017, a semi- truck struck an overhang on the hotel's north side, cracking one corner of it. Architecture The hotel is a six-story building made of steel-reinforced concrete with a brick facade. It was designed by architecture firm Ellerbe & Co. The building features a mix of architectural styles, including English vernacular revival and Art Deco. The facade is visually composed of three layers.

The Kalamazoo State is one of the very few remaining atmospheric picture palaces still intact. It currently remains in operation today as the main performance hall for musicians, comedian, and other live entertainment in the Kalamazoo area.  Nationwide context  In the United States, the mid to late 1920s was a booming time for the film industry. With the growing power and vertical integration of major companies, between 1922 and 1930 the total investment in the film industry jumped from $78 million to $850 million. The average weekly attendance at American movie theatres doubled from 40 million in 1922 to 80 million in 1928. A key component to this growth was the creation of movie theatres. There was competition to provide a tremendous experience which led to the extravagant era of the Picture Palace. The term Picture Palace is used to describe the opulent style of theatre that seated thousands. The iconographic features of the exterior of the theatre were designed to make the front of the theatre a \\"show window\\" to invite customers to come see a performance. With fancy lobbies, uniformed ushers, musical accompaniments, and unique architecture these picture palaces were a unique draw that allowed a place where working and middle-class patrons could find luxury. Reflecting this national trend was Kalamazoo, a rising city during the twenties; due to the rapid increase in population it began to develop a need for a prominent theatre.  Early Years  The Kalamazoo State Theatre was built as a mid-sized picture palace in 1927 for the W.S. Butterfield Theatre chain. The State was constructed in 9 months for $350,000. Initially it was home to vaudeville shows, dance recitals, and silent films. The Kalamazoo State is an atmospheric theatre, which was one of the two basic design styles: atmospheric and conventional, that picture palaces could be. Atmospheric meant that the palace gave the impression of sitting in an auditorium that opened to a night sky. The theatre was designed by John Eberson, a renowned theatre architect out of Chicago, who was known for his style of atmospheric theatres. For the Kalamazoo State he employed a Spanish theme. Originally the State seated 1,300 people with the interior reflecting a beautiful Spanish courtyard. The ceiling is painted dark blue with twinkling electric stars, and moving clouds which are projected across it to create an outdoor atmosphere. The auditorium, lobby, and mezzanine are decorated in a Mediterranean color scheme with pottery, furniture, wrought iron, statues, and paintings. Outside they utilize buff-colored tapestry, brick, and ornate terra-cotta accents.  Barton Theatre Organ  Silent films always had musical accompaniment. In the large picture palaces, such as those in Chicago and Detroit, they would typically have a live orchestra. The smaller palaces, such as the Kalamazoo State Theatre, would have had a chamber group or pipe organ. This was a great improvement from the small town and second run houses which would typically only offer a piano player. The Kalamazoo State is home to a Barton Theatre Organ, which accompanied silent pictures from 1927 to 1937. Barton was one of the better-known companies along with: Wurlitzer, Kimball, and Morton. Theatre organs were a unique combination of multiple instruments and sound effects. These intriguing machines greatly varied in size and complexity ranging from two manuals and six ranks to four or five manuals and more than fifty or sixty ranks. With the advent of \\"talkies,\\" it was silenced until 1950. However, in 1961 it was fully restored and put back into service. The original Barton Organ is still used for special presentations.  Survival  In 1964, the theatre underwent drastic modernization. Due to age-induced damage, the original 45-foot vertical sign on the corner was replaced with a horizontal marquee over the box-office. The interior was stripped of some of its original decor. In 1982, Butterfield decided to stop showing first-run movies at the State and it was closed that same year due to poor profits and the spreading popularity of the suburban movie multiplex. The closing of such a historic part of Kalamazoo began to mobilize community members. Efforts to save the theatre from a tragic end were pursued by several local entrepreneurs and preservationists. Local arts groups and city officials formed the \\"Save the State\\" committee in an effort to preserve the theatre's legacy along with the building. The solution came when the building was purchased in 1985 by the Hinman Company. The purchase brought about further renovation and worked to preserve a part of Kalamazoo's history. Recent preservation efforts have helped to restore the original splendor of the State. After years of uncertainty, Kalamazoo's State Theatre has survived to attract a wide variety of performers. It is one of the few remaining atmospheric movie palaces in the United States.  State in the Twenty-First Century  The Kalamazoo State Theatre is currently owned by the Hinman Company a real-estate development, management, and leasing company. They own property across the United States and have an especially large portfolio in the Kalamazoo area. The State currently is the premier live performance venue in Kalamazoo, hosting performances by the likes of Lewis Black, Kid Cudi, and other popular entertainers. The Kalamazoo State Theatre is part of the League of Historic American Theatres (LHAT), an organization that champions the restoration, preservation and ongoing operations of North America's treasured venues.

During her early childhood, Cleopatra was brought up in the palace of Alexandria in Egypt and received a primarily- Hellenistic Greek education from her tutor, Philostratos. By adulthood she was well-versed in many languages, including Egyptian, Ethiopian, Hebrew, Arabic, Median, Parthian, Latin, and her native Koine Greek. Cleopatra's father was a client ruler of the Roman Republic. When the Romans annexed Cyprus and drove Ptolemy XII's brother Ptolemy of Cyprus to commit suicide rather than go into exile, Ptolemy XII became unpopular with the masses in Egypt for remaining silent and offering no reaction to the events. He and a daughter, ostensibly Cleopatra and not Arsinoe IV, were exiled from Egypt during a revolt. This allowed Cleopatra's older sister Berenice IV to claim the throne in 58 BC, ruling jointly with her mother Cleopatra VI Tryphaena. Ptolemy XII and Cleopatra traveled first to Roman Italy. In the Alban Hills (outside Rome), they stayed at the villa of their Roman patron, the triumvir Pompey the Great. After Ptolemy XII orchestrated the assassinations of Berenice IV's diplomats in Rome, seeking to gain Roman favor, he and Cleopatra left the city's hostile environment and settled at Ephesus in Anatolia. Pompey eventually convinced Aulus Gabinius, the Roman governor of Syria, to invade Egypt and restore Ptolemy XII to power. In the spring of 55 BC, Gabinius' invasion force arrived. His officer Mark Antony prevented Ptolemy XII from massacring the inhabitants of Pelousion for their defiance, and rescued the body of Archelaos (Berenice's husband) after he was killed in battle. Although Antony said years later that it was then that he fell in love with Cleopatra, their affair did not begin until 41 BC. Ptolemy XII made Cleopatra his regent and joint ruler in 52 BC, naming her and his son (Ptolemy XIII) joint successors in his will and testament. Ptolemy XII died by 22 March 51 BC, the date of Cleopatra's first known act as queen: restoring the sacred Buchis bull in Hermonthis, Egypt. She may have married her brother, Ptolemy XIII, but it is uncertain if they married before engaging in open hostilities against one another. Birth and tutelage Hellenistic Greek bust of Ptolemy XII Auletes, the father of Cleopatra VII, in the Louvre Cleopatra VII was born in early 69 BC to Ptolemaic pharaoh Ptolemy XII Auletes and an unknown mother, presumably Ptolemy XII's sister-wife Cleopatra VI Tryphaena, also known as Cleopatra V TryphaenaFor further information and validation see and . For alternate speculation, see and ., , and label the wife of Ptolemy XII Auletes as Cleopatra V Tryphaena, while and call her Cleopatra VI Tryphaena, due to the confusion in primary sources conflating these two figures, who may have been one in the same. As explained by , Cleopatra VI may have actually been a daughter of Ptolemy XII, who appeared in 58 BC to jointly-rule with her alleged sister Berenice IV (while Ptolemy XII was exiled and living in Rome), whereas Ptolemy XII's wife Cleopatra V perhaps died as early as the winter of 69‚Äì68 BC, when she disappears from historical records. assumes that Ptolemy XII's wife, who he numbers as Cleopatra VI, was merely absent from the court for a decade after being expelled for an unknown reason, eventually ruling jointly with her daughter Berenice IV. explains that the Alexandrians deposed Ptolemy XII Auletes and installed \\"his eldest daughter, Berenike IV, and as co-ruler recalled Cleopatra V Tryphaena from 10 years' exile from the court. Although later historians assumed she must have been another of Auletes' daughters and numbered her \\"Cleopatra VI\\", it seems she was simply the fifth one returning to replace her brother and former husband Auletes.\\"‚Äîmother of Cleopatra's older sister, Berenice IV.Due to discrepancies in academic works, in which some consider Cleopatra VI to be either a daughter of Ptolemy XII or his wife, identical to that of Cleopatra V, states that Ptolemy XII had six children, while mentions only five. Ptolemy XII was given the epithet \\"Auletes\\" (\\"the flute-player\\") due to his adoption of the title \\"New Dionysos\\" and his reported flute-playing during the Dionysian festivals.For further information and validation, see and . He had a reputation as an aloof monarch who enjoyed a life of luxury while causing dynastic troubles with the expulsion of Cleopatra VI from the court in late 69 BC (a few months after the birth of Cleopatra VII). His three younger children (Cleopatra's sister Arsinoe IV and brothers Ptolemy XIII and Ptolemy XIV) were born during the more than decade-long absence of his wife. Her childhood tutor was Philostratos, from whom she learned the Greek arts of oration and philosophy. During her youth Cleopatra presumably studied at the Musaeum (including the Library of Alexandria), and wrote Greek medical works which may have been inspired by the physicians at her father's royal court. Available to her in historical records preserved by the 3rd-century BC Ptolemaic-era native Egyptian historian Manetho were examples of strong, inspirational royal female predecessors (some of whom lived long before the Ptolemaic dynasty), such as Sobekneferu, Hatshepsut, and Nefertiti. Ptolemaic pharaohs were crowned by Egyptian priests of Ptah at Memphis but resided in the multicultural and largely-Greek city of Alexandria, founded by Alexander the Great of Macedon.For a thorough explanation about the foundation of Alexandria by Alexander the Great and its largely Hellenistic Greek nature during the Ptolemaic period, along with a survey of the various ethnic groups residing there, see . For further validation about the founding of Alexandria by Alexander the Great, see . They spoke Greek and governed Egypt as Hellenistic Greek monarchs, refusing to learn the native Egyptian language.The rulers of the Ptolemaic dynasty refused to speak Late Egyptian, which is the reason that ancient Greek (i.e. Koine Greek) as well as Late Egyptian were used on official court documents such as the Rosetta Stone: Cleopatra could understand and speak many languages by adulthood, including Egyptian, Ethiopian, Trogodyte, Hebrew (or Aramaic), Arabic, Syrian (perhaps Syriac), Median, Parthian, and Latin, although her Roman colleagues would have preferred to speak with her in her native Koine Greek.For the list of languages spoken by Cleopatra as mentioned by the ancient historian Plutarch, see , which also mentions that the rulers of Ptolemaic Egypt gradually abandoned the Ancient Macedonian language. For further information, see . Aside from Greek, Egyptian, and Latin, the three languages she had a known ability to read and write in, these languages reflected Cleopatra's expansionist territorial ambitions and her desire to regain African and Asian territories which had belonged to the Ptolemaic Empire. Although Egyptians were the dominant ethnic group in Cleopatra's kingdom, large minorities of Greeks, Jews, Celtic and Germanic peoples, Syrians, Nubians, and others inhabited Egypt during her reign and well before it. Greeks and Jews were primarily concentrated in the multicultural cities of Alexandria, the old colony of Naukratis, and Ptolemais Hermiou (near Thebes in Upper Egypt).As explained by , Ptolemaic Alexandria was considered a city-state (i.e. polis) separate from the country of Egypt, with citizenship reserved for Greeks and Ancient Macedonians, but various other ethnic groups resided there, especially the Jews, along with Syrians, Nubians, and others. Greeks, Jews, and Egyptians in these cities were legally segregated, living in different areas and forbidden to intermarry.The exception to this rule forbidding intermarriage between Egyptians and Greeks applied to Greeks living outside the mainly-Greek cities of Alexandria, Naukratis, and Ptolemais Hermiou. As explained by : \\"Except for the inhabitants of Alexandria, Naukratis, and Ptolemais, most Greek immigrants lived in predominantly Egyptian environments where intermarriage was not uncommon, and few of the traditional political or social institutions of Greek culture existed. For all intents and purposes, therefore, the majority of Greeks in Egypt remained essentially resident aliens who retained the citizenship of their home poleis, as can be seen from the fact that Egyptian Greeks continued to identify themselves by their poleis of origin in public and private documents even after their families had resided in Egypt for several generations. Greeks living in such circumstances tended to assimilate to the social and cultural mores of their non-Greek neighbors and in-laws.\\" Also, makes it clear that by Cleopatra's reign, Jews and even upper-class native Egyptians could be legally classified as \\"Greeks\\" if they spoke Greek, received a Greek education, labelled their gods with Greek names, and pursued a Greek lifestyle. The native Egyptian priesthood received a number of privileges and became extremely wealthy under their Ptolemaic patrons, often becoming targets of native Egyptian revolts. Although there were laws against intermarriage in the Greek city-states (poleis) of Egypt, intermarriage was permitted in other parts of Egypt; Cleopatra is speculated to have had an Egyptian half-cousin, Pasherienptah III, the High Priest of Ptah at Memphis. At the beginning of her reign Cleopatra sought the support and loyalty of the Egyptian priesthood, despite attempts by her rival brother and erstwhile co- ruler Ptolemy XIII to undermine this relationship. Reign of Ptolemy XII and Roman interventionism Coin of Ptolemy II Philadelphus and Arsinoe II, who established the tradition of sibling marriage in the Ptolemaic dynasty Roman interventionism in Egypt predated the reign of Cleopatra VII. In 168 BC, after Antiochus IV invaded Ptolemaic Egypt, he obeyed the demands of the Roman Senate to withdraw and return to Seleucid territory instead of warring with the Roman Republic. When Ptolemy IX Lathyros died in late 81 BC, he was succeeded by his daughter Berenice III. With opposition building at the royal court against the idea of a sole female monarch, Berenice III accepted joint rule and marriage to Ptolemy XI Alexander II, the son of Ptolemy IX's brother Ptolemy X Alexander I. The match was arranged by the dictator Sulla, the first powerful Roman figure to intervene directly in the dynastic affairs of kingdoms east of the Roman Republic. Ptolemy XI had his cousin-wife killed shortly after their marriage in 80 BC, but he was killed soon thereafter in the resulting riot over the assassination. Ptolemy XI (and perhaps his uncle Ptolemy IX or his father) willed the Ptolemaic Kingdom to Rome as collateral for loans, so the Romans had legal grounds to take over Egypt (their client state). They chose instead to carve up the Ptolemaic realm to be ruled by Ptolemy IX's two illegitimate sons, bestowing Cyprus to Ptolemy of Cyprus and Egypt to Ptolemy XII. In 65 BC the Roman censor Marcus Licinius Crassus argued before the Roman Senate that Ptolemaic Egypt should be annexed (perhaps based on the previous will in exchange for loans), but his proposed bill was scuttled by Cicero's rhetoric. This was followed by another failed proposal for annexation by tribune Servilius Rullus in 63 BC. Ptolemy XII responded to the threatened Roman annexation of Egypt by offering lavish gifts to powerful Roman statesmen and military commanders, such as Pompey the Great (during his campaign against Mithridates VI of Pontus in the Third Mithridatic War) and Julius Caesar after the latter became consul in 59 BC.For further information, see . After Crassus, Pompey, and Caesar formed the alliance of the First Triumvirate in 60 BC, they gave Ptolemy XII the title of \\"friend and ally of the Roman people\\" for his efforts in financing Pompey's eastern campaigns and Rome's conquests of West Asian territories which had belonged to the Seleucid Empire. The title cost 6,000 talents, nearly the entire annual tax revenue of Ptolemaic Egypt.In 1972, Michael Grant calculated that 6,000 talents, the price of Ptolemy XII Auletes' fee for receiving the title \\"friend and ally of the Roman people\\" from the triumvirs Pompey the Great and Julius Caesar, would be worth roughly 7 million British pounds or 17 million US dollars, roughly the entire annual tax revenue for Ptolemaic Egypt: . Ptolemy XII's profligate behavior bankrupted him, and he was forced to acquire loans from Roman banker Gaius Rabirius Postumus.For further information about the loans acquired by Ptolemy XII from Roman banker Gaius Rabirius Postumus, see . His increase of the tax rate to pay for these expenditures angered the poor and led to strikes by farmers. Exile of Ptolemy XII and Cleopatra Gate of Ptolemy XII at the Temple of Kom Ombo, partially built by Cleopatra's father In 58 BC, after Roman senator Publius Clodius Pulcher accused Ptolemy XII's brother (Ptolemy of Cyprus) of aiding pirates who disrupted Roman shipping, the Roman Republic annexed Cyprus and drove Ptolemy of Cyprus, where he committed suicide rather than face exile to Paphos as a priest of Apollo.For political background information on the Roman annexation of Cyprus, a move pushed for in the Roman Senate by Publius Clodius Pulcher, see . Ptolemy XII remained publicly silent on the death of his brother, a decision which (along with ceding traditional Ptolemaic territory to the Romans) damaged his credibility among subjects already enraged by his economic policies. Whether by force or voluntary action, Ptolemy XII left Egypt in exile to Rhodes and his Roman host, Cato the Younger, who castigated him for losing his kingdom while seated on a latrine and undergoing laxative treatment.For further information, see . Ptolemy XII then traveled to Athens, where he erected a monument in honor of his father and half-sister (Berenice III), and finally to the triumvir Pompey's villa in the Alban Hills near Praeneste.For further information, see . Ptolemy XII spent nearly a year on the outskirts of Rome, ostensibly accompanied by his 11-year-old daughter Cleopatra. Joann Fletcher expresses little doubt about this, noting an ancient Greek primary source stating that Ptolemy XII traveled with one of his daughters; since Berenice IV was his ruling rival and Arsinoe IV was a toddler, it must have been Cleopatra (who was later made his regent and named his successor in his will). Events in Egypt are unclear around this time. It is thought that Ptolemy XII's estranged wife, Cleopatra V (or VI) Tryphaena, ruled jointly with Berenice IV before she was ousted by the latter and died at an uncertain date. Berenice IV sent an emissary to Rome to advocate for her rule and oppose the reinstatement of her father Ptolemy XII, but Ptolemy used his assassins to kill the emissary (an incident covered up by his powerful Roman supporters).For further information, see . When Caesar failed to secure a popular election as Governor-General of Egypt, he settled for a five-year command of Gaul and allowed his rival Pompey to settle the matter of the Egyptian throne. The Roman Senate denied Ptolemy XII the offer of an armed escort and provisions for a return to Egypt, so he decided to leave Rome in late 57 BC for the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. Return to Egypt from exile Posthumous portrait of Cleopatra VII with red hair and distinctive facial features, wearing a royal diadem and pearl-studded hairpins, from Herculaneum, 1st century AD describes the painting from Herculaneum further: \\"Cleopatra's hair was maintained by her highly skilled hairdresser Eiras. Although rather artificial looking wigs set in the traditional tripartite style of long straight hair would have been required for her appearances before her Egyptian subjects, a more practical option for general day-to-day wear was the no-nonsense 'melon hairdo' in which her natural hair was drawn back in sections resembling the lines on a melon and then pinned up in a bun at the back of the head. A trademark style of Arsinoe II and Berenike II, the style had fallen from fashion for almost two centuries until revived by Cleopatra; yet as both traditionalist and innovator, she wore her version without her predecessor's fine head veil. And whereas they had both been blonde like Alexander, Cleopatra may well have been a redhead, judging from the portrait of a flame-haired woman wearing the royal diadem surrounded by Egyptian motifs which has been identified as Cleopatra.\\" Second- style painting in the House of Marcus Fabius Rufus at Pompeii, depicting Cleopatra as Venus Genetrix and her son Caesarion as Cupid (mid-1st century BC) To shore up her legitimacy with her subjects, Berenice IV married Archelaos (reportedly a descendant of Mithridates VI of Pontus); however, the Romans‚Äî especially desperate financiers of Ptolemy XII such as Rabirius Postumus‚Äîwere determined to restore Ptolemy XII. Pompey persuaded the Roman governor of Syria Aulus Gabinius to invade Egypt and restore Ptolemy XII, offering him 10,000 talents for the mission.For further information, see . Although it put him at odds with Roman law, Gabinius invaded Egypt in the spring of 55 BC by way of Hasmonean Judea; Hyrcanus II had Antipater the Idumaean, the father of Herod the Great, furnish the Roman-led army with supplies. Under Gabinius' command was the young cavalry officer Mark Antony, who distinguished himself by preventing Ptolemy XII from massacring the inhabitants of Pelousion and rescuing the body of Archelaos after the latter was killed in another battle (ensuring him a royal burial). The 14-year-old Cleopatra would have accompanied the Roman expedition into Egypt; years later, Mark Antony said that he had fallen in love with her at this time. Their affair only began 41 BC, when the triumvir Antony summoned Cleopatra to his headquarters at Tarsos to answer for her alleged support of Gaius Cassius Longinus in the Liberators' civil war of 43‚Äì42 BC. Gabinius was tried (and acquitted) in Rome for abusing his authority, but his second trial (for accepting bribes) led to a seven-year exile from which he was recalled in 48 BC by Julius Caesar. Crassus replaced him as governor of Syria, extending his provincial command to Egypt until he was killed by the Parthians in the 53 BC Battle of Carrhae. Ptolemy XII had his rival daughter Berenice and her wealthy supporters executed, seizing their properties and allowing the Gabiniani (Gabinius' largely-Germanic and Gallic Roman garrison) to harass people in the streets of Alexandria.For further information on Roman financier Rabirius Postumus as well as the Gabiniani left in Egypt by Aulus Gabinius, see . He installed his longtime Roman financier, Rabirius Postumus, as his chief financial officer. Postumus was unable to collect all of Ptolemy XII's debt by the latter's death and it was passed on to his successors, Cleopatra VII and Ptolemy XIII. Within a year, Postumus was placed under protective custody and sent back to Rome when his life was threatened for draining Egypt of its resources.For further information, see . During the last four years of his reign, Ptolemy XII (who died of natural causes) designated Cleopatra VII and Ptolemy XIII as his heirs, oversaw major construction projects such as the completion of the Temple of Edfu and establishment of the Dendera Temple, and stabilized an economy largely reliant on trade with East Africa and India.For further information, see . A copy of his will was sent to Pompey to be kept in Rome, and the original was held in Alexandria for safekeeping. According to an inscription in the Temple of Hathor at Dendera, Cleopatra was made a regent of Ptolemy XII on 31 May 52 BC.For further information, see . Accession to the throne Ptolemy XII died sometime before 22 March 51 BC, the date of Cleopatra's first known act as queen: her voyage to Hermonthis, near Thebes, to install a new sacred Buchis bull (worshiped as an intermediary for the god Montu in ancient Egyptian religion).For further information and validation, see and . indicates that Ptolemy XII could have been alive as late as May, while an ancient Egyptian source affirms he was still ruling with Cleopatra by 15 July 51 BC, although by this point Cleopatra most likely \\"hushed up her father's death\\" so that she could consolidate her control of Egypt. states that the partial solar eclipse of 7 March 51 BC marked the death of Ptolemy XII Auletes and accession of Cleopatra to the throne, although she apparently suppressed the news of his death, alerting the Roman Senate to this fact months later in a message they received on 30 June 51 BC. However, claims that the Senate was informed of his death on 1 August 51 BC. The Roman Senate was not informed about Ptolemy's death until 30 June or 1 August 51 BC; the news may have been suppressed by Cleopatra until she could secure the throne. states that the partial solar eclipse of 7 March 51 BC marked the death of Ptolemy XII Auletes and accession of Cleopatra to the throne, although she apparently suppressed the news of his death, alerting the Roman Senate to this fact months later in a message they received on 30 June 51 BC. However, claims that the Senate was informed of his death on 1 August 51 BC. Cleopatra probably married her brother, Ptolemy XIII, but the marriage is uncertain. The incestuous Ptolemaic practice of sibling marriage was introduced by Ptolemy II and his sister, Arsinoe II, but the long-held royal Egyptian practice was considered scandalous by contemporary Greeks. Although vocal critics of this incestuous practice were sometimes violently punished and suppressed during the joint reign of Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II, write the following about the sibling marriage of Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II: \\"Ptolemy Keraunos, who wanted to become king of Macedon...killed Arsino√´'s small children in front of her. Now queen without a kingdom, Arsino√´ fled to Egypt, where she was welcomed by her full brother Ptolemy II. Not content, however, to spend the rest of her life as a guest at the Ptolemaic court, she had Ptolemy II's wife exiled to Upper Egypt and married him herself around 275 B.C. Though such an incestuous marriage was considered scandalous by the Greeks, it was allowed by Egyptian custom. For that reason the marriage split public opinion into two factions. The loyal side celebrated the couple as a return of the divine marriage of Zeus and Hera, whereas the other side did not refrain from profuse and obscene criticism. One of the most sarcastic commentators, a poet with a very sharp pen, had to flee Alexandria. The unfortunate poet was caught off the shore of Crete by the Ptolemaic navy, put in an iron basket, and drowned. This and similar actions seemingly slowed down vicious criticism.\\" sibling marriages were nevertheless considered a normal arrangement for Ptolemaic rulers by the time of Cleopatra's reign. Official documents began listing Cleopatra as sole ruler by 29 August 51 BC, evidence that she had rejected her brother as a co- ruler.

The reign of Cleopatra VII of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt began with the death of her father, the ruling pharaoh Ptolemy XII Auletes, by March 52 BC. It ended with her death on 10 or 11 August 31 BC. Following the reign of Cleopatra, the country of Egypt was transformed into a province of the Roman Empire and the Hellenistic period came to an end. notes that the Hellenistic period, beginning with the reign of Alexander the Great (336‚Äì323 BC), came to an end with the death of Cleopatra in 30 BC. Michael Grant stresses that the Hellenistic Greeks were viewed by contemporary Romans as having declined and diminished in greatness since the age of Classical Greece, an attitude that has continued even into the works of modern historiography. In regards to Hellenistic Egypt, Grant argues that \\"Cleopatra VII, looking back upon all that her ancestors had done during that time, was not likely to make the same mistake. But she and her contemporaries of the first century BC had another, peculiar, problem of their own. Could the 'Hellenistic Age' (which we ourselves often regard as coming to an end in about her time) still be said to exist at all, could any Greek age, now that the Romans were the dominant power? This was a question never far from Cleopatra's mind. But it is quite certain that she considered the Greek epoch to be by no means finished, and intended to do everything in her power to ensure its perpetuation.\\" During her reign she ruled Egypt and other territories as an absolute monarch, in the tradition of the Ptolemaic dynasty's founder Ptolemy I Soter (r. 305‚Äì276 BC) as well as Alexander the Great (r. 336‚Äì301 BC) of Macedon, who captured Egypt from the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Cleopatra and her younger brother Ptolemy XIII acceded to the throne as joint rulers, but a fallout between them led to open civil war. Cleopatra fled briefly to Roman Syria in 48 BC but returned later that year with an army to confront Ptolemy XIII. As a Roman client state, Roman statesman Pompey the Great planned Ptolemaic Egypt as a place of refuge after losing the 48 BC Battle of Pharsalus in Greece against his rival Julius Caesar in Caesar's Civil War. However, Ptolemy XIII had Pompey killed at Pelousion and sent his severed head to Caesar, while the latter occupied Alexandria in pursuit of Pompey. With his authority as consul of the Roman Republic, Caesar attempted to reconcile Ptolemy XIII with Cleopatra. However, Ptolemy XIII's chief adviser Potheinos viewed Caesar's terms as favoring Cleopatra. So his forces, led first by Achillas and then Ganymedes under Arsinoe IV (Cleopatra's younger sister), besieged both Caesar and Cleopatra at the palace. Reinforcements lifted the siege in early 47 BC and Ptolemy XIII died shortly afterwards in the Battle of the Nile. Arsinoe IV was eventually exiled to Ephesus and Caesar, now an elected dictator, declared Cleopatra and her younger brother Ptolemy XIV as joint rulers of Egypt. However, Caesar maintained a private affair with Cleopatra that produced a son, Caesarion (later Ptolemy XV), before he departed Alexandria for Rome. Cleopatra traveled to Rome as a client queen in 46 and 44 BC, staying at his villa. Following Caesar's assassination in 44 BC Cleopatra attempted to have Caesarion named as his heir. Caesar's grandnephew Octavian (known as Augustus by 27 BC, when he became the first Roman emperor) thwarted this. Cleopatra then had her brother Ptolemy XIV killed and elevated her son Caesarion as co-ruler. In the Liberators' civil war of 43‚Äì42 BC, Cleopatra sided with the Roman Second Triumvirate formed by Octavian, Mark Antony, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. She developed a personal relationship with Mark Antony that would eventually produce three children: the twins Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene II, and Ptolemy Philadelphus. Antony used his authority as triumvir to carry out the execution of Arsinoe IV at Cleopatra's request. He became increasingly reliant on Cleopatra for both funding and military aid during his invasions of the Parthian Empire and the Kingdom of Armenia. Although his invasion of Parthia was unsuccessful, he managed to occupy Armenia. He brought King Artavasdes II back to Alexandria in 34 BC as a prisoner in his mock Roman triumph hosted by Cleopatra. This was followed by the Donations of Alexandria, in which Cleopatra's children with Antony received various territories under Antony's triumviral authority. Cleopatra was named the Queen of Kings and Caesarion the King of Kings. This event, along with Antony's marriage to Cleopatra and divorce of Octavia Minor, sister of Octavian, marked a turning point that led to the Final War of the Roman Republic. After engaging in a war of propaganda, Octavian forced Antony's allies in the Roman Senate to flee Rome in 32 BC. He declared war on Cleopatra for unlawfully providing military support to Antony, now a private Roman citizen without public office. Antony and Cleopatra led a joint naval force at the 31 BC Battle of Actium against Octavian's general Agrippa, who won the battle after Cleopatra and Antony fled to the Peloponnese and eventually Egypt. Octavian's forces invaded Egypt in 30 BC. Although Antony and Cleopatra offered military resistance, Octavian defeated their forces, leading to Antony's suicide. When it became clear that Octavian planned to have Cleopatra brought to Rome as a prisoner for his triumphal procession, she also committed suicide, the cause of death reportedly by use of poison. The popular belief is that she was bitten by an asp. Accession to the throne Ptolemy XII Auletes, ruling pharaoh of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt, designated in his will that his daughter Cleopatra VII should reign alongside her brother Ptolemy XIII as co-rulers in the moment of his death.For further information, see On 31 May 52 BC Cleopatra was made a regent of Ptolemy XII as indicated by an inscription in the Temple of Hathor at Dendera.For further information, see Duane W. Roller asserts that Ptolemy XII perhaps died sometime before 22 March 51 BC, while Joann Fletcher offers the date 7 March 51 BC. Michael Grant claims it could have occurred as late as May of that year.For further information, see . states that the partial solar eclipse of 7 March 51 BC marked the death of Ptolemy XII Auletes and accession of Cleopatra to the throne, although she apparently suppressed the news of his death, alerting the Roman Senate to this fact months later in a message they received on 30 June 51 BC. However, claims that the Senate was informed of his death on 1 August 51 BC. Michael Grant indicates that Ptolemy XII could have been alive as late as May, while an ancient Egyptian source affirms he was still ruling with Cleopatra by 15 July 51 BC, although by this point Cleopatra most likely \\"hushed up her father's death\\" so that she could consolidate her control of Egypt. Cleopatra's first known act as queen occurred on 22 March 51 BC. She traveled to Hermonthis, near Thebes, to install a new sacred Buchis bull, worshiped as an intermediary for the god Montu in the Ancient Egyptian religion.For further information see and . The Roman Senate, which viewed Ptolemaic Egypt as a client state, was not informed of the death of Ptolemy XII until 30 June or 1 August 51 BC. This was most likely an attempt by Cleopatra to suppress this information and consolidate power. Cleopatra perhaps wedded her brother Ptolemy XIII, write the following about the incestuous marriage of Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II, who introduced the practice of sibling marriage into the Ptolemaic dynasty: \\"Ptolemy Keraunos, who wanted to become king of Macedon...killed Arsino√´'s small children in front of her. Now queen without a kingdom, Arsino√´ fled to Egypt, where she was welcomed by her full brother Ptolemy II. Not content, however, to spend the rest of her life as a guest at the Ptolemaic court, she had Ptolemy II's wife exiled to Upper Egypt and married him herself around 275 B.C. Though such an incestuous marriage was considered scandalous by the Greeks, it was allowed by Egyptian custom. For that reason the marriage split public opinion into two factions. The loyal side celebrated the couple as a return of the divine marriage of Zeus and Hera, whereas the other side did not refrain from profuse and obscene criticism. One of the most sarcastic commentators, a poet with a very sharp pen, had to flee Alexandria. The unfortunate poet was caught off the shore of Crete by the Ptolemaic navy, put in an iron basket, and drowned. This and similar actions seemingly slowed down vicious criticism.\\" but it is unknown if their marriage ever took place. By 29 August 51 BC official documents began listing Cleopatra as the sole ruler, evidence that she had rejected her brother as a co-ruler by this point. Cleopatra faced several pressing issues and emergencies shortly after taking the throne. These included food shortages and famine caused by drought and low-level flooding of the Nile and assaults by gangs of armed brigands. The lawless behavior instigated by the Gabiniani, the now unemployed, assimilated, and largely Germanic and Gallic Roman soldiers left by Aulus Gabinius to garrison Egypt after restoring Ptolemy XII and removing his daughter Berenice IV from power was also a problem. As an astute financial administrator of her kingdom, Cleopatra eventually brought the combined wealth of tax revenues and foreign trade up to 12,000 talents a year, surpassing the wealth creation of some of her Ptolemaic predecessors. In the meantime, however, she inherited her father's debts and owed the Roman Republic 17.5 million drachmas by the time Julius Caesar arrived at Alexandria in 48 BC. Roman or Hellenistic Egyptian art, Parian marble, 1st century BC, Capitoline Museums, Rome In 50 BC Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, proconsul of Syria, sent his two eldest sons to Egypt. This was most likely to negotiate with the Gabiniani and recruit them as soldiers in the desperate defense of Syria against the Parthians. However, the Gabiniani tortured and murdered them, perhaps with secret encouragement by rogue senior administrators in Cleopatra's court such as the eunuch regent Potheinos. This led her to send the Gabiniani culprits to Bibulus as prisoners awaiting his judgment. Although a seemingly shrewd act by the young queen, Bibulus sent the prisoners back to her and chastised her for interfering in Roman affairs that should have been handled directly by the Roman Senate. Bibulus, siding with Pompey the Great in Caesar's Civil War, was then charged with preventing Caesar from landing a naval fleet in Greece. He failed at the task which ultimately allowed Julius Caesar to reach Egypt in pursuit of Pompey. Although Cleopatra had rejected her 11-year-old brother as a joint ruler in 51 BC, Ptolemy XIII still retained strong allies, notably Potheinos, his tutor and administrator of his properties. The Romans, including Caesar, initially viewed him as the power behind the throne. Others involved in the cabal against Cleopatra included Achillas, a prominent military commander, and Theodotus of Chios, another tutor of Ptolemy XIII. Cleopatra seems to have attempted a short-lived alliance with her brother Ptolemy XIV, but by the autumn of 50 BC Ptolemy XIII had the upper hand in their conflict and began signing documents with his name before that of his sister, followed by the establishment of his first regnal date in 49 BC.For further information, see Assassination of Pompey Cleopatra and her forces were still holding their ground against Ptolemy XIII within Alexandria when Gnaeus Pompeius, son of Pompey, arrived at Alexandria in the summer of 49 BC seeking military aid on behalf of his father. After returning to Italy from the wars in Gaul and crossing the Rubicon in January of 49 BC, Caesar forced Pompey and his supporters to flee to Greece in a Roman civil war. In perhaps their last joint decree, both Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII agreed to Gnaeus Pompeius' request. They sent his father 60 ships and 500 troops, including the Gabiniani, a move that helped erase some of the debt owed to Rome by the Ptolemies. The Roman writer Lucan claims that by early 48 BC Pompey named Ptolemy XIII as the legitimate sole ruler of Egypt; whether true or not Cleopatra was forced to flee Alexandria and withdraw to the region of Thebes. However, by the spring of 48 BC Cleopatra traveled to Syria with her younger sister Arsinoe IV to gather an invasion force that would head to Egypt. She returned with an army, perhaps right around the time of Caesar's arrival, but her brother's forces, including some Gabiniani mobilized to fight against her. They blocked her advance to Alexandria, and she had to make camp outside Pelousion in the eastern Nile Delta. In Greece, Caesar and Pompey's forces engaged each other at the decisive Battle of Pharsalus on 9 August 48 BC, leading to the destruction of most of Pompey's army and his forced flight to Tyre, Lebanon.For further information, see and . Given his close relationship with the Ptolemies, he ultimately decided that Egypt would be his place of refuge, where he could replenish his forces. Ptolemy XIII's advisers, however, feared the idea of Pompey using Egypt as his base of power in a protracted Roman civil war. They also wanted to ensure that none of the Gabiniani would leave their campaign against Cleopatra to join Pompey's forces instead. In a scheme devised by Theodotos, Pompey arrived by ship near Pelousion after being invited by written message, only to be ambushed and stabbed to death on 28 September 48 BC.For further information, see and . Ptolemy XIII believed he had demonstrated his power and simultaneously defused the situation by having Pompey's severed head sent to Caesar, who arrived in Alexandria by early October and resided at the royal palace. Theodotos presented Caesar with his son-in-law Pompey's embalmed head, which Caesar retrieved and planned to bury properly along the shores of Alexandria. Caesar expressed grief and outrage over the killing of Pompey, and called on both Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra VII to disband their forces and reconcile.For further information, see and Relationship with Julius Caesar Caesar's request for partial repayment of the 17.5 million drachmas owed to Rome (to pay for immediate military expenditures) was met with a response by Potheinos. He replied that it would be made later if Caesar would leave Alexandria, but this offer was rejected. Ptolemy XIII arrived at Alexandria at the head of his army, in clear defiance of Caesar's demand that he disband and leave his army before his arrival. Cleopatra initially sent emissaries to Caesar, but upon allegedly hearing that Caesar was inclined to having affairs with royal women, she came to Alexandria to see him personally. Historian Cassius Dio records that she simply did so without informing her brother, dressing in an attractive manner and charming Caesar with her wit and linguistic skills. Plutarch provides an entirely different and perhaps mythical account that alleges she was bound inside a bed sack to be smuggled into the palace to meet Caesar.For further information, see and . When Ptolemy XIII realized that his sister was in the palace consorting directly with Caesar instead of at Pelousion, he attempted to rouse the populace of Alexandria into a riot. Caesar arrested him then used his oratorical skills to calm the frenzied crowd gathered outside the palace. Caesar then brought Cleopatra VII and Ptolemy XIII before the assembly of Alexandria. Here he revealed the written will of Ptolemy XII‚Äîpreviously possessed by Pompey‚Äînaming Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII as his joint heirs.For further information, see . Caesar then attempted to arrange for the other two siblings, Arsinoe IV and Ptolemy XIV, to rule together over Cyprus, thus removing potential rival claimants to the Egyptian throne. This would also appease the Ptolemaic subjects still bitter over the loss of Cyprus to the Romans in 58 BC. Potheinos, judged that this agreement actually favored Cleopatra over Ptolemy XIII and that the latter's army of 20,000, including the Gabiniani, could most likely defeat Caesar's army of 4,000 unsupported troops. He decided to have Achillas lead their forces to Alexandria to attack both Caesar and Cleopatra.For further information, see . The resulting siege of the palace with Caesar and Cleopatra trapped inside lasted into the following year of 47 BC. It included Caesar's burning of ships in the harbor that spread fires and potentially burned down part of the Library of Alexandria.For further information, see and . Caesar managed to execute Potheinos after he attempted an assassination plot against him. Arsinoe IV joined forces with Achillas and was declared queen. Soon afterwards, she had her tutor Ganymedes kill Achillas and take his position as commander of her army.For further information, see . Ganymedes then tricked Caesar into requesting the presence of his erstwhile captive Ptolemy XIII as a negotiator, only to have him join the army of Arsinoe IV. With his detailed knowledge of the palace, Ganymedes pumped seawater into the reservoirs via water pipes, but Cleopatra and Caesar countered this by ordering the construction of fresh water wells. Sometime between January and March 47 BC Caesar's reinforcements arrived. These included soldiers led by Mithridates of Pergamon and Antipater the Idumaean, who would receive Roman citizenship for his timely aid (a status that would be inherited by his son Herod the Great).For further information, see . For the Siege of Alexandria (47 BC), states that Julius Caesar's reinforcements came in January, but says that his reinforcements came in March. Ptolemy XIII and Arsinoe IV withdrew their forces to the Nile River, where Caesar attacked them and forced Ptolemy XIII to flee by boat. It capsized, and he drowned. His body was later found nearby in the mud.For further information, see . Ganymedes was perhaps killed in the battle. Theodotos was found years later in Asia by Marcus Brutus and executed. Arsinoe IV was forcefully paraded in Caesar's triumph in Rome before being exiled to the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. Cleopatra was conspicuously absent from these events and resided in the palace, most likely because she was pregnant with Caesar's child (perhaps since September 47 BC). She gave birth to Caesarion on 23 June 47 BC. Caesar and Cleopatra likely visited the Tomb of Alexander the Great together. Caesar also ensured the proper burial of Pompey's embalmed head in a tomb near the eastern wall of Alexandria. Caesar's term as consul had expired at the end of 48 BC. However, his officer Mark Antony, recently returned to Rome from the battle at Pharsalus, helped to secure Caesar's election as dictator. This lasted for a year, until October 47 BC, providing Caesar with the legal authority to settle the dynastic dispute in Egypt. Wary of repeating the mistake of Berenice IV in having a sole-ruling female monarch, Caesar appointed 12-year-old Ptolemy XIV as 22-year-old Cleopatra VII's joint ruler in a nominal sibling marriage, but Cleopatra continued living privately with Caesar.For further information, see . states that at this point (47 BC) Ptolemy XIV was 12 years old, while claims that he was still only 10 years of age. The exact date at which Cyprus was returned to her control is not known, although she had a governor there by 42 BC. Before returning to Rome to attend to urgent political matters, Caesar is alleged to have joined Cleopatra for a cruise of the Nile and sightseeing of monuments, although this may be a romantic tale reflecting later well-to-do Roman proclivities and not a real historic event.For further information, see . The historian Suetonius provided considerable details about the voyage, including use of a Thalamegos pleasure barge. First constructed by Ptolemy IV during his reign, it measured in length and in height and was complete with dining rooms, state rooms, holy shrines, and promenades along its two decks resembling a floating villa. Cleopatra allegedly used the Thalamegos again years later to sail to Mark Antony's provisional headquarters at Tarsos. Its design almost certainly had an influence on the later Roman Nemi ships. Caesar could have been interested in a Nile cruise owing to his fascination with geography. He was well-read in the works of Eratosthenes and Pytheas, and perhaps wanted to discover the source of the river, but his troops reportedly demanded they turn back after nearly reaching Ethiopia. Cleopatra and Caesar (1866). Painting by Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me Caesar departed from Egypt in about April 47 BC. The reason for his departure was said to be that Pharnaces II of Pontus, son of Mithridates the Great, was stirring up trouble for Rome in Anatolia and needed to be confronted. It is possible, however, that Caesar, married to the prominent Roman woman Calpurnia, wanted to avoid being seen together with Cleopatra when she bore him their son. He left three legions in Egypt, later increased to four, under the command of the freedman Rufio, to secure Cleopatra's tenuous position but also perhaps to keep her activities in check. Cleopatra's alleged child with Caesar was born 23 June 47 BC, as preserved on a stele at the Serapeion in Memphis.For further information, see and . In the stele he was named \\"Pharaoh Caesar\\", but the Alexandrians preferred the patronymic Caesarion. Perhaps owing to his still childless marriage with Calpurnia, Caesar remained silent about Caesarion. There is conflicting evidence that he publicly denied fathering him but privately accepted him as his son. writes the following about Julius Caesar and his parentage of Caesarion: \\"The matter of parentage became so tangled in the propaganda war between Antonius and Octavian in the late 30s B.C.‚Äìit was essential for one side to prove and the other to reject Caesar's role‚Äìthat it is impossible today to determine Caesar's actual response. The extant information is almost contradictory: it was said that Caesar denied parentage in his will but acknowledged it privately and allowed use of the name Caesarion. Caesar's associate C. Oppius even wrote a pamphlet proving that Caesarion was not Caesar's child, and C. Helvius Cinna‚Äìthe poet who was killed by rioters after Antonius's funeral oration‚Äìwas prepared in 44 B.C. to introduce legislation to allow Caesar to marry as many wives as he wished for the purpose of having children. Although much of this talk was generated after Caesar's death, it seems that he himself wished to be as quiet as possible about the child but had to contend with Cleopatra's repeated assertions.\\" Cleopatra, on the other hand, made repeated official declarations about Caesarion's parentage, with Caesar as the father. She also built a Caesareum temple near the harbor of Alexandria dedicated to his worship. Cleopatra VII and her nominal joint ruler Ptolemy XIV visited Rome sometime in late 46 BC, presumably without Caesarion. They were given lodging in Caesar's Villa within the Horti Caesaris.For further information and validation, see . Like he did with their father Ptolemy XII, Julius Caesar awarded both Cleopatra VII and Ptolemy XIV with the legal status of 'friend and ally of the Roman people' (), in effect client rulers loyal to Rome. Cleopatra's distinguished visitors at Caesar's villa across the Tiber included the senator Cicero. He was not flattered by her and found her to be arrogant, especially after one of her advisers failed to provide him with requested books from the Library of Alexandria. Sosigenes of Alexandria, one of the members of Cleopatra's court, aided Caesar in the calculations for the new Julian Calendar, put into effect 1 January 45 BC. The Temple of Venus Genetrix, established in the Forum of Caesar on 25 September 46 BC, contained a golden statue of Cleopatra (which still stood there during the 3rd century AD), associating the mother of Caesar's child directly with the goddess Venus, mother of the Romans. The statue also subtly linked the Egyptian goddess Isis with the Roman religion. Caesar may have had plans to build a temple to Isis in Rome, as was voted by the Senate a year after his death. Fletcher asserts that it is unclear if Cleopatra consistently stayed in Rome until 44 BC or briefly returned to Egypt after Caesar traveled to Roman Spain in November 46 BC to wage war against the sons of Pompey. Since Cleopatra was also present in the city in 44 BC during Caesar's assassination, it is unclear if this represented a single, two-year- long trip to Rome or two separate visits. The latter is more likely according to Roller. Cleopatra's presence in Rome most likely had an effect on the events at the Lupercalia festival a month before Caesar's assassination. Mark Antony attempted to place a royal diadem on Caesar's head, which he refused. This was most likely a staged performance, perhaps to gauge the Roman public's mood about accepting Hellenistic-style kingship. Cicero, who was present at the festival, mockingly asked where the diadem came from, an obvious reference to the Ptolemaic queen who he abhorred. Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March (15 March 44 BC), but Cleopatra stayed in Rome until about mid-April, in the vain hope of having Caesarion recognized as Caesar's heir. However, Caesar's will named his grandnephew Octavian as the primary heir. He arrived in Italy around the same time Cleopatra decided to depart for Egypt. A few months later Cleopatra decided to kill Ptolemy XIV by poisoning, elevating her son Caesarion instead as her co-ruler. Cleopatra in the Liberators' civil war aurei bearing the portraits of Mark Antony (left) and Octavian (right), issued in 41 BC to celebrate the establishment of the Second Triumvirate by Octavian, Antony and Marcus Lepidus in 43 BC Cleopatra's Gate in Tarsos (Tarsus, Mersin, Turkey), the site where she met Mark Antony in 41 BC Octavian, Mark Antony, and Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate in 43 BC. They were each elected for five-year terms to restore order to the Republic and bring Caesar's assassins to justice. Cleopatra received messages from both Gaius Cassius Longinus, one of Caesar's assassins, and Publius Cornelius Dolabella, proconsul of Syria and a Caesarian loyalist, requesting military aid. She decided to write Cassius an excuse that her kingdom faced too many internal problems, while sending the four legions left by Caesar in Egypt to Dolabella. However, Cassius captured these troops in Palestine, while they traveled en route to Syria. Serapion, Cleopatra's governor of Cyprus, defected to Cassius and provided him with ships. Cleopatra took her own fleet to Greece to personally assist Octavian and Antony. Her ships were heavily damaged in a Mediterranean storm, however, and she arrived too late to aid in the fighting. By the autumn of 42 BC Antony had defeated the forces of Caesar's assassins at the Battle of Philippi in Greece, leading to the suicides of Cassius and Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger. By the end of 42 BC, Octavian gained control over much of the western half of the Roman Republic and Antony the eastern half, with Lepidus largely marginalized. Antony moved his headquarters from Athens to Tarsos in Anatolia by the summer of 41 BC. He summoned Cleopatra to Tarsos in several letters, invitations she initially rebuffed until he sent his envoy Quintus Dellius to Alexandria, convincing her to come. The meeting would allow Cleopatra to clear up the misconception that she seemed to support Cassius during the civil war, and would address pressing issues about territorial exchanges in the Levant. Mark Antony also undoubtedly desired to form a personal, romantic relationship with the queen. Cleopatra sailed up the Kydnos River to Tarsos in her Thalamegos, inviting Antony and his officers for two nights of lavish banquets on board her ship. Antony attempted to return the favor on the third night of dining with his own far less luxurious banquet. Cleopatra presented herself as the Egyptian goddess Isis in the appearance of the Greek goddess Aphrodite, meeting her divine husband Osiris in the form of the Greek god Dionysus, the latter whom the priests of Artemis at Ephesus had associated with Antony prior to this meeting with Cleopatra. Some surviving coins of Cleopatra also depict her as Venus‚ÄìAphrodite. Cleopatra managed to clear her name as a supposed supporter of Cassius, arguing she had really attempted to help Dolabella in Syria. At the same time she convinced Antony to have her rival sister Arsinoe IV dragged from her place of exile at the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus and executed. Her former governor of Cyprus Serapion, who had rebelled against her and joined Cassius, was found at Tyre and handed over to Cleopatra. Relationship with Mark Antony Roman bust of the consul and triumvir Mark Antony, Vatican Museums Cleopatra invited Antony to come to Egypt before departing from Tarsos, which led Antony to visit Alexandria by November 41 BC. He was well received by the populace of Alexandria for his heroic actions in restoring Ptolemy XII to power and, unlike Caesar, coming to Egypt without an occupational force. In Egypt, Antony continued to enjoy the lavish royal lifestyle he had witnessed aboard Cleopatra's ship docked at Tarsos. He also had his subordinates, such as Publius Ventidius Bassus, drive the Parthians out of Anatolia and Syria.For further information, see . Of all the queens of antiquity, those who ruled independently at times were married for most of their careers. Cleopatra, however, reigned for most of her 21 years as a sole monarch, with nominal joint rulers and a possible marriage to Antony very late in her life. Having Caesarion as her sole heir produced both benefits and dangers. His sudden death could extinguish the dynasty, but rivalry with other potential heirs and siblings could also spell his downfall. Cleopatra carefully chose Antony as her partner to produce further heirs, as he was deemed to be the most powerful Roman figure following Caesar's demise. With his triumviral powers, Antony also had the broad authority to restore former Ptolemaic lands to Cleopatra now in Roman hands. While it is clear that Cleopatra controlled both Cilicia and Cyprus by 19 November 38 BC with a mention of her governor Diogenes who administered both, the transfer probably occurred earlier in the winter of 41‚Äì40 BC, during her time spent with Antony. Plutarch asserted that Cleopatra played dice, drank alcohol, hunted wild game, and attended military exercises with Antony. These masculine activities did not endear her to later Roman authors, but they demonstrated the close relationship she fostered with her Roman partner. By the spring of 40 BC, troubles in Syria forced Mark Antony to end his vacation in Egypt with Cleopatra. His governor Lucius Decidius Saxa had been killed and his army taken by Quintus Labienus, a former officer under Cassius who now served the Parthian Empire. Cleopatra provided Antony with 200 ships for his campaign and as payment for her newly acquired territories. She would not see him again until 37 BC, but she maintained correspondence and evidence suggests she kept a spy in his camp. By the end of 40 BC Cleopatra gave birth to twins, a boy named Alexander Helios and a girl named Cleopatra Selene II, both of whom Antony acknowledged as his children. Helios (), the sun, and Selene (), the moon, were symbolic of a new era of societal rejuvenation, as well as sign that Cleopatra hoped Antony would repeat the exploits of Alexander the Great by conquering Persia. Events of the Perusine War (41‚Äì40 BC) disrupted Mark Antony's focus on confronting the Parthians in the east. The war was initiated by his ambitious wife Fulvia against Octavian in the hopes of making her husband the undisputed leader of Rome. Although it has been suggested that part of her motivation was to cleave Antony from Cleopatra, this is unlikely, as the conflict emerged in Italy even before Cleopatra's meeting with Antony at Tarsos. Fulvia and Antony's brother Lucius Antonius were eventually besieged by Octavian at Perusia (modern Perugia, Italy) and then exiled from Italy. Fulvia died after this at Sikyon in Greece while attempting to reach Antony. Her sudden death led to a reconciliation of Octavian and Antony at Brundisium in Italy in September 40 BC. Although the agreement struck at Brundisium solidified Antony's control of the Roman Republic's territories east of the Ionian Sea, it also stipulated that he concede Italia, Hispania, and Gaul, and marry Octavian's sister Octavia the Younger, a potential rival for Cleopatra. In December 40 BC Cleopatra received Herod I (the Great) in Alexandria as an unexpected guest and refugee who fled a turbulent situation in Judea. Mark Antony had established Herod there as a tetrarch, but he was soon at odds with Antigonus II Mattathias of the long- established Hasmonean dynasty. Antigonus had imprisoned Herod's brother and fellow tetrarch Phasael, who was executed while Herod was in mid-flight towards Cleopatra's court. Cleopatra attempted to provide him with a military assignment, but Herod declined and traveled to Rome, where the triumvirs Octavian and Mark Antony named him king of Judea. This act put Herod on a collision course with Cleopatra, who wished to reclaim former Ptolemaic territories of his new Herodian kingdom. Antony and Cleopatra, by Lawrence Alma-Tadema Relations between Mark Antony and Cleopatra perhaps soured when he not only married Octavia, but having moved his headquarters to Athens also sired her two children, Antonia the Elder in 39 BC and Antonia Minor in 36 BC. However, Cleopatra's position in Egypt was secure. Her rival Herod was occupied with civil war in Judea that required heavy Roman military assistance, but received none from Cleopatra. Since the triumviral authority of Mark Antony and Octavian had expired on 1 January 37 BC, Octavia arranged for a meeting at Tarentum where the triumvirate was officially extended to 33 BC. With two legions granted by Octavian and a thousand soldiers lent by Octavia, Mark Antony traveled to Antioch, where he made preparations for war against the Parthians. Antony summoned Cleopatra to Antioch to discuss pressing issues such as Herod's kingdom and financial support for his Parthian campaign. Cleopatra brought her three-year-old twins to Antioch, where Mark Antony saw them for the first time. They probably first received their surnames Helios and Selene here as part of Antony and Cleopatra's ambitious plans for the future. In order to stabilize the east, Antony not only enlarged Cleopatra's domain but also established new ruling dynasties and client rulers who would be loyal to him yet would ultimately outlast him. These included Herod I of Judea, Amyntas of Galatia, Polemon I of Pontus and Archelaus of Cappadocia. Most likely a posthumous painted portrait of Cleopatra VII of Ptolemaic Egypt with red hair and her distinct facial features, wearing a royal diadem and pearl-studded hairpins, from Roman Herculaneum, Italy, 1st century AD describes the painting from Herculaneum further: \\"Cleopatra's hair was maintained by her highly skilled hairdresser Eiras. Although rather artificial looking wigs set in the traditional tripartite style of long straight hair would have been required for her appearances before her Egyptian subjects, a more practical option for general day-to-day wear was the no- nonsense 'melon hairdo' in which her natural hair was drawn back in sections resembling the lines on a melon and then pinned up in a bun at the back of the head. A trademark style of Arsinoe II and Berenike II, the style had fallen from fashion for almost two centuries until revived by Cleopatra; yet as both traditionalist and innovator, she wore her version without her predecessor's fine head veil. And whereas they had both been blonde like Alexander, Cleopatra may well have been a redhead, judging from the portrait of a flame- haired woman wearing the royal diadem surrounded by Egyptian motifs which has been identified as Cleopatra.\\" In this arrangement Cleopatra gained significant former Ptolemaic territories in the Levant. This included nearly all of Phoenicia (centered in what is now modern Lebanon) minus Tyre and Sidon, which remained in Roman hands. She also received Ptolemais Akko (modern Acre, Israel), a city that Ptolemy II established. Given her ancestral relations with the Seleucids, Antony granted her the region of Koile-Syria along the upper Orontes River. She was even given the region surrounding Jericho in Palestine, but she leased this territory back to Herod. At the expense of the Nabataean king Malichus I (a cousin of Herod), Cleopatra was also given a portion of the Nabataean Kingdom around the Gulf of Aqaba on the Red Sea, including Ailana (modern Aqaba, Jordan). To the west Cleopatra was handed Cyrene along the Libyan coast, as well as Itanos and Olous in Roman Crete. This restored much of the territory lost by the Ptolemies, but did not include any territories in the Aegean Sea or southwest Asia Minor. Cleopatra's control over much of these new territories was nominal, and they were still administered by Roman officials. Nevertheless, they enriched her kingdom and led her to declare the inauguration of a new era by double-dating her coinage in 36 BC. Antony's rival Octavian exploited the enlargement of the Ptolemaic realm by relinquishing directly controlled Roman territory. Octavian tapped into public sentiment in Rome against the empowerment of a foreign queen at the expense of their Republic. Octavian also fostered the narrative that Antony was neglecting his virtuous Roman wife Octavia. He granted her and his wife Livia the extraordinary privileges of sacrosanctity. Cornelia Africana, daughter of Scipio Africanus, mother of the reformists Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, and love interest of Cleopatra's great-grandfather Ptolemy VIII, was the first living Roman woman to have a statue dedicated in her honor. She was followed by Octavian's sister Octavia and his wife Livia, whose statues were most likely erected in the Forum of Caesar to rival that of Cleopatra's statue erected there earlier by Julius Caesar. In 36 BC, Cleopatra accompanied Antony to the Euphrates River, perhaps as far as Seleucia at the Zeugma, on the first leg of his journey to invade the Parthian Empire. She then toured of some of her newly acquired territories. She traveled past Damascus and entered the lands of Herod, who escorted her in lavish conditions back to the Egyptian border town of Pelousion. Her main reason for returning to Egypt was her advanced state of pregnancy. By the summer of 36 BC she gave birth to Ptolemy Philadelphus, her second son with Antony. He was also named after the second monarch of the Ptolemaic dynasty in what Cleopatra almost certainly intended as a prophetic gesture that the Ptolemaic Kingdom would be restored to its former glory. Antony's Parthian campaign in 36 BC turned into a complete debacle having been stymied by a number of factors such as extreme weather, the spread of disease, and the betrayal of Artavasdes II of Armenia, who defected to the Parthian side. After losing some 30,000 men, more so than Crassus at Carrhae (an indignity he had hoped to avenge), Antony finally arrived at Leukokome near Berytus (modern Beirut, Lebanon) in December. He engaged in heavy drinking before Cleopatra arrived to provide funds and clothing for his battered troops. Octavia offered to lend him more troops for another expedition. Antony wished to avoid the political pitfalls of returning to Rome, however, so traveled with Cleopatra back to Alexandria to see his newborn son. Donations of Alexandria A denarius minted in 32 BC; on the obverse is a diademed bust of Cleopatra, with the Latin inscription \\"CLEOPATRA[E REGINAE REGVM]FILIORVM REGVM\\", and on the reverse a bust of Mark Antony with the inscription reading ANTONI ARMENIA DEVICTA. Antony prepared for another Parthian expedition in 35 BC, this time aimed at their ally Armenia. As he did so Octavia traveled to Athens with 2,000 troops in alleged support of Antony. This was most likely a scheme devised by Octavian to embarrass Antony for his military losses. claims that Octavia Minor provided Mark Antony with 1,200 troops, not 2,000 as stated in and Antony received the troops and told Octavia not to stray east of Athens. He and Cleopatra traveled together to Antioch, only to suddenly and inexplicably abandon the military campaign and head back to Alexandria. When Octavia returned to Rome Octavian portrayed his sister as a victim wronged by Antony. She refused to leave Antony's household, however, and return to Octavian's in Rome. Octavian's confidence grew as he eliminated his rivals in the west. These included Sextus Pompeius and even Lepidus, the third member of the triumvirate, who was placed under house arrest after revolting against Octavian in Sicily. Antony sent Quintus Dellius as his envoy to Artavasdes II of Armenia in 34 BC to negotiate a potential marriage alliance between the Armenian king's daughter and Antony and Cleopatra's son Alexander Helios. When this was declined, Antony marched his army into Armenia, defeated its forces and captured the king and the Armenian royal family. They were sent back to Alexandria as prisoners in golden chains befitting their royal status. Antony then held a military parade in Alexandria mocking a Roman triumph. He dressed as Dionysos and rode into the city on a chariot presenting the royal prisoners to Queen Cleopatra, who sat on a golden throne above a silver dais. News of this event was heavily criticized in Rome as being distasteful, if not a perversion of time-honored Roman rites and rituals to be enjoyed instead by an Egyptian queen and her subjects. In an event held at the gymnasium soon after the triumph, known as the Donations of Alexandria, Cleopatra dressed as Isis and declared that she was the Queen of Kings with her son Caesarion, King of Kings. She declared Alexander Helios, dressed as a Median, king of Armenia, Medes, and Parthia, and two-year-old Ptolemy Philadelphos, dressed as a Macedonian-Greek ruler, king of Syria and Cilicia. Cleopatra Selene was also bestowed with Crete and Cyrene. Given the polemic, contradictory, and fragmentary nature of primary sources from the period, it is uncertain if Cleopatra and Antony were also formally wed at this ceremony or if they had any marriage at all. says that it is unclear if they were ever truly married, while says that the marriage publicly sealed Antony's alliance with Cleopatra, in defiance of Octavian now that he was divorced from Octavia. However, coins of Antony and Cleopatra depict them in the typical manner of a Hellenistic royal couple. Antony then sent a report to Rome requesting ratification of these territorial claims, which Octavian wanted to publicize for propaganda purposes, but the two consuls, both supporters of Antony, had it censored from public view. In late 34 BC, following the Donations of Alexandria, Antony and Octavian engaged in a heated war of propaganda that would last for years. Antony claimed that his rival had illegally deposed Lepidus from their triumvirate and barred him from raising troops in Italy. Octavian accused Antony of unlawfully detaining the king of Armenia, marrying Cleopatra despite still being married to his sister Octavia, and wrongfully claiming Caesarion as the heir of Caesar instead of Octavian. The litany of accusations and gossip associated with this propaganda war have shaped popular perceptions of Cleopatra from Augustan-period literature to various media in modern times. papyrus document dated February 33 BC granting military commander Publius Canidius Crassus tax exemptions in Egypt and containing the signature of Cleopatra VII in a different hand, with her statement \\"make it happen\\" Aside from casual criticisms of Cleopatra's extravagant lifestyle and corruption of simple Antony with her opulence, she was also said by some Roman authors to have resorted to witchcraft as a lethal sorceress. She not only toyed with the idea of poisoning many, Antony included, but also intended to conquer and punish Rome itself. She a woman as dangerous as Homer's Helen of Troy in toppling the order of civilization. Antony was generally viewed as having lost his judgment, brainwashed by Cleopatra's magic spells. Antony's supporters rebutted with tales of Octavian's wild and promiscuous sex life, while graffiti now often appeared slandering either side as being sexually obscene. Cleopatra had a conveniently timed Sibylline oracle claim that Rome would be punished but that peace and reconciliation would follow in a golden age led by the queen. In an account of Lucius Munatius Plancus, preserved in Horace's Satires, Cleopatra was said to have made a bet that she could spend 2.5 million drachmas in a single evening. She proved it by removing a pearl, one of the most expensive known, from one of her earrings and dissolving it in vinegar at her dinner party. The accusation that Antony had stolen the books of the Library of Pergamon to restock the Library of Alexandria, however, was an admitted fabrication by Gaius Calvisius Sabinus. He may have been the source of many other slanders of Antony in support of Octavian's side. A papyrus document dated to February 33 BC contains with little doubt the signature handwriting of Cleopatra VII. It concerns certain tax exemptions in Egypt granted to Publius Canidius Crassus (or Quintus Caecillius),Stanley M. Burstein, in provides the name Quintus Cascellius as the recipient of the tax exemption, not the Publius Canidius Crassus provided by Duane W. Roller in . former Roman consul and Antony's confidant who would command his land forces at Actium. A subscript in a different handwriting at the bottom of the papyrus reads \\"make it happen\\" (), undoubtedly the autograph of the queen, as it was Ptolemaic practice to countersign documents to avoid forgery. Battle of Actium A reconstructed statue of Augustus as a younger Octavian, dated ca. 30 BC In a speech to the Roman Senate on the first day of his consulship on 1 January 33 BC, Octavian accused Antony of attempting to subvert Roman freedoms and authority as a slave to his Oriental queen, who he said was given lands that rightfully belonged to the Romans. Before Antony and Octavian's joint imperium expired on 31 December 33 BC, Antony declared Caesarion as the true heir of Julius Caesar in an attempt to undermine Octavian. On 1 January 32 BC the Antonian loyalists Gaius Sosius and Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus were elected as consuls. On 1 February 32 BC Sosius gave a fiery speech condemning Octavian, now a private citizen without public office, introducing pieces of legislation against him. During the next senatorial session, Octavian entered the Senate house with armed guards and levied his own accusations against the consuls. Intimidated by this act, the next day the consuls and over two-hundred senators still in support of Antony fled Rome and joined his side. Antony established his own counter Roman Senate. Although he held military office and his reputation was still largely intact, Antony was still fundamentally reliant on Cleopatra for military support. The couple traveled together to Ephesus in 32 BC, where Cleopatra provided him with 200 naval ships of the 800 total he was able to acquire. Domitius Ahenobarbus, wary of having Octavian's propaganda confirmed to the public, attempted to persuade Antony to have Cleopatra excluded entirely from the military efforts launched against Octavian. Publius Canidius Crassus made the counterargument that Cleopatra was funding the war effort and, as a long-reigning monarch, was by no means inferior to the male allied kings Antony had summoned for the campaign. Cleopatra refused Antony's requests that she return to Egypt, judging that by blocking Octavian in Greece she could defend Egypt more easily from him. Cleopatra's insistence that she be involved in the battle for Greece led to defections of prominent Romans such as Domitius Ahenobarbus and Lucius Munatius Plancus. During the spring of 32 BC Antony and Cleopatra traveled to Samos and then Athens, where Cleopatra was reportedly well received. She persuaded Antony to send Octavia an official declaration of divorce. This encouraged Munatius Plancus to advise Octavian that he should seize Antony's will, invested with the Vestal Virgins. Although a violation of sacred customs and legal rights, Octavian forcefully acquired the document from the Temple of Vesta. It was a useful tool in the propaganda war against Antony and Cleopatra. In the selective public reading of the will, Octavian highlighted the claim that Caesarion was heir to Caesar, that the Donations of Alexandria were legal, that Antony should be buried alongside Cleopatra in Egypt instead of Rome, and that Alexandria would be made the new capital of the Roman Republic. In a show of loyalty to Rome, Octavian decided to begin construction of his own mausoleum at the Campus Martius. His legal standing was also improved by being elected consul in 31 BC, reentering public office. With Antony's will made public, Octavian had his casus belli and Rome declared war on Cleopatra, not Antony.As explained by : \\"politically, Octavian had to walk a fine line as he prepared to engage in open hostilities with Antony. He was careful to minimize associations with civil war, as the Roman people had already suffered through many years of civil conflict and Octavian could risk losing support if he declared war on a fellow citizen.\\" The legal argument for war was based less on Cleopatra's territorial acquisitions, with former Roman territories ruled by her children with Antony, and more on the fact that she was providing military support to a private citizen now that Antony's triumviral authority had expired. Octavian's wish to invade Egypt also coincided with his financial concern of collecting the massive debts owed to Caesar by Cleopatra's father Ptolemy XII. These were passed on to Cleopatra and were now the prerogative of Octavian, Caesar's heir. A hemiobol coin of Cleopatra VII struck in 32/31 BC, showing her wearing the royal diadem Antony and Cleopatra had greater numbers of troops (i.e. 100,000 men) and ships (i.e. 800 vessels) than Octavian, who reportedly had 200 ships and 80,000 men. However, the crews of Antony and Cleopatra's navy were not all well-trained, some of them perhaps from merchant vessels, whereas Octavian had a fully professional force. Antony wanted to cross the Adriatic Sea and blockade Octavian at either Tarentum or Brundisium, but Cleopatra, concerned primarily with defending Egypt, overrode the decision to attack Italy directly. Antony and Cleopatra set up their winter headquarters at Patrai in Greece and by the spring of 31 BC they moved to Actium along the southern Ambracian Gulf. With this position Cleopatra had the defense of Egypt in mind, as any southward movement by Octavian's fleet along the coast of Greece could be detected. Cleopatra and Antony had the support of various allied kings. Conflict between Cleopatra and Herod had previously erupted and an earthquake in Judea provided an excuse for him and his forces not to be present at Actium in support of the couple. They also lost the support of Malichus I of Nabataea, which would prove to have strategic consequences. Antony and Cleopatra lost several skirmishes against Octavian around Actium during the summer of 31 BC. Defections to Octavian's camp continued, including Antony's long-time companion Quintus Dellius. The allied kings also began to defect to Octavian's side, starting with Amyntas of Galatia and Deiotaros of Paphlagonia. While some in Antony's camp suggested abandoning the naval conflict to retreat inland and face Octavian in the Greek interior, Cleopatra urged for a naval confrontation to keep Octavian's fleet away from Egypt. Second-style painting in the House of Marcus Fabius Rufus at Pompeii, Italy, depicting Cleopatra VII as Venus Genetrix and her son Caesarion as a cupid, mid-1st century BC On 2 September 31 BC the naval forces of Octavian, led by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, met those of Antony and Cleopatra for a decisive engagement, the Battle of Actium. On board her flagship the Antonias, Cleopatra commanded 60 ships at the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf, at the rear of the fleet. This was likely a move by Antony's officers to marginalize her during the battle. Antony had ordered that their ships have sails on board for a better chance to pursue or flee from the enemy. Cleopatra, ever-concerned about defending Egypt, used them to move swiftly through the area of major combat in a strategic withdrawal to the Peloponnese. Burstein writes that partisan Roman writers would later accuse Cleopatra of cowardly deserting Antony, but their original intention of keeping their sails on board may have been to break the blockade and salvage as much of their fleet as possible. Antony followed her and boarded her ship, identified by its distinctive purple sails, as the two escaped the battle and headed for Tainaron. Antony reportedly avoided Cleopatra during this three-day voyage, until her ladies in waiting at Tainaron urged him to speak with her. The Battle of Actium raged on without Cleopatra and Antony, until the morning of 3 September, when there were massive defections of both officers, troops, and even allied kings to Octavian's side. Downfall and death Roman painting from the House of Giuseppe II, Pompeii, early 1st century AD, most likely depicting Cleopatra VII, wearing her royal diadem, consuming poison in an act of suicide, while her son Caesarion, also wearing a royal diadem, stands behind her While Octavian occupied Athens, Antony and Cleopatra landed at Paraitonion in Egypt. The couple went their separate ways. Antony went to Cyrene to raise more troops. Cleopatra sailed into the harbor at Alexandria in a misleading attempt to portray the activities in Greece as a victory. Conflicting reports make it unclear if Cleopatra had financial difficulties at this juncture or not. Some claims, such as robbing temples of their wealth to pay for her military expenditures, were likely Augustan propaganda. It is also uncertain if she actually executed Artavasdes II of Armenia and sent his head to his rival Artavasdes I, king of Media Atropatene, in an attempt to strike an alliance with him. Lucius Pinarius, Mark Antony's appointed governor of Cyrene, received word that Octavian had won the Battle of Actium before Antony's messengers could arrive at his court. Pinarius had these messengers executed and defected to Octavian's side, surrendering to him the four legions under his command that Antony wanted to obtain. Antony nearly committed suicide after this news but his staff officers stopped him. In Alexandria he built a reclusive cottage on the island of Pharos. He nicknamed it the Timoneion, after the philosopher Timon of Athens, who was famous for his cynicism and misanthropy. Herod the Great, who had personally advised Antony after the Battle of Actium that he should betray Cleopatra, traveled to Rhodes to meet Octavian and resign his kingship out of loyalty to Antony. Impressed by his speech and sense of loyalty, Octavian allowed him to maintain his position in Judea, further isolating Antony and Cleopatra. Cleopatra perhaps started to view Antony as a liability by the late summer of 31 BC, when she prepared to leave Egypt to her son Caesarion. As an object of Roman hostility, Cleopatra would relinquish her throne and remove herself from the equation by taking her fleet from the Mediterranean into the Red Sea and then setting sail to a foreign port, perhaps in India where she could spend time recuperating. However, these plans were ultimately abandoned when Malichus I of Nabataea, as advised by Octavian's governor of Syria Quintus Didius, managed to burn Cleopatra's fleet, in revenge for his losses in a war with Herod largely initiated by Cleopatra. Cleopatra had no option but to stay in Egypt and negotiate with Octavian. Although most likely pro-Octavian propaganda, it was reported at this time that Cleopatra had begun testing the strengths of various poisons on prisoners and even her own servants. Cleopatra and Octavian, a painting by Louis Gauffier, 1787 The Death of Cleopatra by Guido Cagnacci, 1658 Cleopatra had Caesarion enter into the ranks of the ephebi. This, along with reliefs on a stele from Koptos dated 21 September 31 BC, demonstrate that she was now grooming her son to become the partial ruler of Egypt. In a show of solidarity Antony also had Marcus Antonius Antyllus, his son with Fulvia, enter the ephebi at the same time. Separate messages and envoys from Antony and Cleopatra were then sent to Octavia, still stationed at Rhodes, although Octavian seems to have replied only to Cleopatra. Cleopatra requested that her children inherit Egypt and that Antony be allowed to live there in ecstasy. She offered Octavian money in the future and immediately sent him gifts of a golden scepter, crown, and throne. Octavian sent his diplomat Thyrsos to Cleopatra after she had threatened to immolate herself and vast amounts of her treasure within a tomb already under construction. Thyrsos advised her to kill Antony so that her life would be spared. When Antony suspected foul intent, however, he had this diplomat flogged and sent back to Octavian without a deal. From Octavian's point of view, Lepidus could be trusted under house arrest. Antony, however, had to be eliminated, and Caesarion, the rival heir to Julius Caesar, could not be trusted either. After lengthy negotiations that ultimately produced no results, Octavian set out to invade Egypt in the spring of 30 BC. He stopped at Ptolemais in Phoenicia where his new ally Herod entertained him and provided his army with fresh supplies. Octavian moved south and swiftly took Pelousion, while Cornelius Gallus, marching eastward from Cyrene, defeated Antony's forces near Paraitonion. Octavian advanced quickly to Alexandria. Antony returned and won a small victory over Octavian's tired troops outside the city's hippodrome. However, on 1 August 30 BC Antony's naval fleet surrendered to Octavian, followed by his cavalry. Cleopatra hid herself in her tomb with her close attendants, sending a message to Antony that she had committed suicide. In despair, Antony responded by stabbing himself in the stomach, taking his own life at age 53. According to Plutarch, however, Antony was allegedly still dying when he was brought to Cleopatra at her tomb. Plutarch told her Antony had died honorably in a contest against a fellow Roman, and that she could trust Octavian's companion Gaius Proculeius over anyone else in his entourage. It was Proculeius, however, who infiltrated her tomb using a ladder and detained the queen, denying her the ability to immolate herself with her treasures. Cleopatra was then allowed to embalm and bury Antony within her tomb before she was escorted to the palace. Cleopatra, by Benedetto Gennari, 1674‚Äì1675 Octavian entered Alexandria and gave a speech of reconciliation at the gymnasium before settling in the palace and seizing Cleopatra's three youngest children. When she met with Octavian she looked disheveled but still retained her poise and classic charm. She told him bluntly, \\"I will not be led in a triumph\\" () according to Livy, a rare recording of her exact words. Octavian promised that he would keep her alive but offered no explanation about his plans for her kingdom. When a spy informed her that Octavian planned to move her and her children to Rome in three days she prepared for suicide. She had no intention of being paraded in a Roman triumph like her sister Arsinoe IV. It is unclear if Cleopatra's suicide, in August 30 BC at age 39, took place within the palace or her tomb.Theodore Cressy Skeat, in , uses historical data to calculate the death of Cleopatra as having occurred on 12 August 30 BC. provides the same date as Skeat, while tepidly support this, saying it occurred circa that date. Those in favor of claiming her death occurred on 10 August 30 BC include , , and . It is said her servants Eiras and Charmion also took their own lives to accompany her. Octavian was apparently angered by this outcome but had her buried in royal fashion next to Antony in her tomb. Cleopatra's physician Olympos did not give an account of the cause of her death. The popular belief is that she allowed an asp, or Egyptian cobra, to bite and poison her. Plutarch relates this tale, but then suggests an implement (knestis) was used to introduce the toxin by scratching. Cassius Dio says that she injected the poison with a needle (belone), and Strabo argued for an ointment of some kind.For the translated accounts of both Plutarch and Cassius Dio, writes that the implement used to puncture Cleopatra's skin was a hairpin. No venomous snake was found with her body, but she did have tiny puncture wounds on her arm that could have been caused by a needle. Fragments of a Roman oil lamp with an erotic scene of a nude Cleopatra wearing a diadem, riding an Egyptian crocodile while sitting on a phallus, Mus√©e de Die Cleopatra, though long desiring to preserve her kingdom, decided in her last moments to send Caesarion away to Upper Egypt perhaps with plans to flee to Nubia, Ethiopia or India. Caesarion, now Ptolemy XV, reigned for a mere eighteen days until he was executed on the orders of Octavian on 29 August 30 BC. He had been returning to Alexandria under the false pretense that Octavian would allow him to be king. and explain the nominal short-lived reign of Caesarion, or Ptolemy XV, as lasting eighteen days in August 30 BC. However, Duane W. Roller, relaying Theodore Cressy Skeat, affirms that Caesarion's reign \\"was essentially a fiction created by Egyptian chronographers to close the gap between [Cleopatra's] death and official Roman control of Egypt (under the new pharaoh, Octavian),\\" citing, for instance, the Stromata by Clement of Alexandria (). Plutarch, translated by , wrote in vague terms that \\"Octavian had Caesarion killed later, after Cleopatra's death.\\" Octavian hesitated to have him killed at first, but the advice of philosopher and friend Arius Didymus convinced him there was room for only one Caesar in the world. With the fall of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, Egypt was made into a Roman province. This marked the end of Hellenistic Egypt and the entire Hellenistic age that had begun with the reign of Alexander the Great (336‚Äì323 BC) of Macedon. In January 27 BC Octavian was renamed Augustus ('the revered') and amassed constitutional powers that established him as the first Roman emperor, inaugurating the Principate era of the Roman Empire. Roman emperors were thereafter considered pharaohs of Egypt, but unlike the Ptolemaic rulers they did not reside in Egypt. Octavian, now Augustus, distanced himself from Egyptian royal rituals, such as coronation in the Egyptian style or worshiping the Apis bull. He was, however, depicted in Egyptian temples as a typical pharaoh making sacrifices to the gods. Unlike regular Roman provinces, Octavian established Egypt as territory under his personal control. He barred the Roman Senate from intervening in any of its affairs and appointed his own equestrian governors of Egypt, the first of whom was Cornelius Gallus. Egypt under the monarchy of Cleopatra Cleopatra's personal rule of Egypt followed the model of virtual absolute monarchy that had existed in the Kingdom of Macedon in northern Greece, the homeland of Alexander the Great, before he and his successors, the Diadochi, spread this style of monarchy throughout the conquered Achaemenid Persian Empire. Classical Greece (480‚Äì336 BC) had contained a variety of city-states (i.e. poleis) possessing various forms of government, including democracy and oligarchy. These city-states continued to have these forms of government in Hellenistic Greece (336‚Äì146 BC) and even later Roman Greece. They were heavily influenced and in many cases dominated by the Hellenistic monarchies of the Antigonid, Seleucid, and Ptolemaic realms. Beginning with the reign of Ptolemy I Soter, founder of the Ptolemaic dynasty, the Ptolemaic Kingdom had fought a series of conflicts‚Äîthe Syrian Wars‚Äîagainst the Seleucid Empire over control of Syria. Cleopatra's kingdom was based in Egypt but she desired to expand it and incorporate territories of North Africa, West Asia, and the eastern Mediterranean Basin that had belonged to her illustrious ancestor Ptolemy I Soter. Cleopatra was nominally the sole lawgiver in her kingdom. As proven by the discovery of a papyrus signed by Cleopatra granting tax exemptions to Antony's Roman colleague Quintus Cascellius, she was directly involved in the administrative affairs of her kingdom. The Musaeum and adjacent Library of Alexandria attracted scholars from all over the Hellenistic world, who were also allowed to live in Egypt with total tax exemptions. Cleopatra was also the chief religious authority in the kingdom, carrying out rituals and rites in the ancient Egyptian religion that her native Egyptian subjects viewed as preventing the destruction of the world. Given the largely-Greek presence and multicultural nature of Ptolemaic cities like Alexandria, Cleopatra was also obligated to oversee religious ceremonies honoring the various Greek deities. Ethnic Greeks staffed the upper levels of government administrations, albeit within the framework of the scribal bureaucracy that had existed in Egypt since the Old Kingdom. Many administrators of Cleopatra's royal court had served during her father's reign, although some of them were killed in the civil war between her and Ptolemy XIII. The names of more than twenty regional governors serving under Cleopatra are known from inscriptions and papyri records, indicating some were ethnic Greeks and others were native Egyptians. Two legally-defined classes divided Ptolemaic Egyptian society: Greeks and Egyptians. Macedonians and Greeks inhabited the city-states of Alexandria, Naukratis, and Ptolemais Hermiou. Considered full citizens of those poleis, they were forbidden to marry native Egyptians (although Greeks living outside of these municipalities could). Native Egyptians and even Jews could be classified as Greeks if they abandoned their original cultures, received a Greek education, labeled their gods and goddesses with Greek names, and embraced the Greek lifestyle. Native Egyptians had been largely excluded from serving in the military by the reign of Ptolemy II, replaced by Greek and Jewish landholders called cleruchs. By the reign of Ptolemy IV in the late 3rd century BC they were reintroduced as phalangite soldiers. Large migrations of Greeks to Egypt ceased by the 2nd century BC, so that the Greek minority in Ptolemaic Egypt remained demographically small. Although Egyptian priests were often wealthy landowners who rivaled the wealth of the Ptolemaic pharaohs, the Ptolemaic monarchs technically owned all Egyptian lands as part of their estate. Virtually all aspects of the Egyptian economy were nominally tightly controlled or supervised by the central government headquartered in Alexandria. The Ptolemaic rulers exacted high tariffs on imported and exported goods, established price controls for various goods, imposed high exchange rates for foreign currencies, established state monopolies over certain industries such as vegetable oil and textile production, and forced farming peasants to stay in their villages during planting and harvesting periods. However, the effectiveness of these policies and the authority of Ptolemaic rulers, including Cleopatra, to execute them fully were more of an ideal than a reality. Cleopatra and many of her royal predecessors found it necessary to clear all the private debts of their subjects to the government at the start of their reigns, due to widespread financial corruption by local officials abusing the general populace. Abuses often led workers to partake in general strikes until the government agreed to meet their demands. At the beginning of her reign, local officials harassed destitute farmers by collecting taxes during a famine and drought. Cleopatra curtailed these predatory measures and introduced relief efforts such as releasing grain from the royal granary. Cleopatra VII. 51‚Äì30 BC, 40 drachms, minted at Alexandria; obverse: diademed bust of Cleopatra VII; reverse: an inscription reading \\"ŒíŒëŒ£ŒôŒõŒôŒ£Œ£ŒóŒ£ ŒöŒõŒïŒüŒ†ŒëŒ§Œ°ŒëŒ£\\", with an eagle standing on a thunderbolt Both Ptolemy XII and Cleopatra VII found it necessary to debase Ptolemaic coinage due to financial troubles. No gold coins are known from Cleopatra's reign, while use of bronze coins was revived (absent since the reign of Ptolemy IX) and silver currency was debased roughly 40% by the end of her reign. Coins struck under Cleopatra's reign came from a wide geographical expanse, including sites in Egypt like Alexandria, but also the island of Cyprus, Antioch, Damascus and Chalcis ad Belum in Syria, Tripolis in Phoenicia, Askalon in Judea, and Cyrenaica in Libya. Surviving coins minted under Cleopatra include those from virtually every year of her reign. They commonly bore an image of Cleopatra, along with that of the goddess Isis. Some imitate the coinage of her Ptolemaic ancestor Arsinoe II. Coins struck with Mark Antony include Roman denarii with dual images of Cleopatra and Antony, the first time that a foreign queen appeared on Roman coins with Latin inscriptions. In addition to various ancient Greco-Roman works of art and literature depicting the queen,For a survey of ancient visual arts and works of literature depicting Cleopatra, see . Cleopatra's legacy has partially survived in some of her ambitious building programs in Egypt utilizing Greek, Roman, and Egyptian styles of architecture. She established a Caesareum temple dedicated to the worship of her partner Julius Caesar near the palatial seafront of Alexandria. Its entrance was flanked by 200-ton rose granite obelisks, monuments placed there by Augustus in 13/12 BC. These were later known as Cleopatra's Needles and were relocated to New York and London in the 19th century. In conjunction with renewing a grant of asylum to Jews in Egypt and the pro-Jewish policies of Julius Caesar, Cleopatra also erected a synagogue in Alexandria. mentions that Cleopatra also renewed the license of another synagogue, perhaps at Leontopolis. The city required extensive rebuilding following the civil war with her brother Ptolemy XIII, including necessary repairs to the Gymnasium and the Lighthouse of Alexandria on the island of Pharos. It is not known if Cleopatra made significant repairs or alterations to the Library of Alexandria or the royal palace, although Lucan hints at the latter. Cleopatra also began construction of her tomb (finished by Augustus) in the same palace precinct as the Tomb of Alexander the Great. Although the exact location of both of these is still unknown, Cleopatra's tomb may have served as the model for the Mausoleum of Augustus and that of later Roman emperors. Although established earlier, Cleopatra resumed construction of the Dendera Temple complex (near modern Qena, Egypt). Reliefs were made depicting Cleopatra and her son Caesarion presenting offerings to the deities Hathor and Ihy, mirroring images of offerings to Isis and Horus. At the Hathor-Isis temple of Deir el-Medina, Cleopatra erected a large granite stela with dual inscriptions in Ancient Greek and Demotic Egyptian and images depicting her worshiping Montu and her son Caesarion worshiping Amun-Ra. The cult center of Montu at Hermonthis was refashioned with images of Caesarion's divine birth by Julius Caesar, depicted as Amun-Ra. It included an elaborate facade and entrance kiosk with large columns bearing the cartouches of Cleopatra and Caesarion. In the front entrance pylon of the Temple of Edfu, built by her father Ptolemy XII, Cleopatra erected two granite statues of Horus guarding the miniature figure of Caesarion. Construction of a temple dedicated to the goddess Isis at Ptolemais Hermiou was overseen by Cleopatra's regional governor Kallimachos.

He was a vassal of the Rashtrakuta king Dhruva Dharavarsha and appears to have helped his overlord subjugate the Vengi Chalukya ruler Vishnuvardhana IV.  Reign  Arikesari was a son of his predecessor Vinayaditya; he had a brother named Biragriha. The records of Arikesari's successors state that he conquered the kingdoms of Vengi and Trikalinga during the reign of his overlord Nirupama-deva, who can be identified as the Rashtrakuta king Dhruva Dharavarsha. Dhruva had ascended the throne after a war of succession against his brother Govinda II, who had been supported by the Vengi Chalukya king Vishnuvardhana IV. It appears that after consolidating his power, Dhruva sent an army led by Arikesari to chastise Vishnuvardhana, whose territories included Vengi and Trikalinga. Vishnuvardhana later negotiated peace, and married his daughter Shila-mahadevi to Dhruva. It was probably Arikesari, who moved the dynasty's capital from Podana (modern Bodhan) to Vemulavada. He was succeeded by his son Narasimha I.  Inscription  The undated Kollipara copper-plate inscription, assigned to 9th century, records a village grant made by Arikesari to the religious leader Mugdha- shivacharya. However, its authenticity of the inscription is doubtful, because it provides a false genealogy of the dynasty, and a verse in it suggests that it was written in year 4121 of the Kaliyuga (1019-20 CE), half a century after the Vemulavada Chalukya dynasty came to an end. The inscription comprises 5 copper-plates, and is written in Sanskrit language using the Telugu-Kannada script. It includes 18 verses in various metres, including four imprecatory verses at the end, and three prose passages describing the village boundaries. The inscription states that Arikesari was a member of the Lunar dynasty, and names his ancestors as follows: Satyashraya Rana-Vikrama, Prithvipati, Maharaja, Rajaditya, and Vinayaditya. It then describes Vinayaditya as a great conqueror, before whom kings of several kingdoms bowed. The inscription describes Arikesari as a just king and a skilled archer, who bore the titles Samasta-lokashraya, Tribhuvana-malla, Raja-trinetra, and Sahasa-rama. It states that he was a learned man, who was proficient in grammar, law, medicine, and gaja-tantra. The inscription describes Arikesari's grant as a vida-dana (\\"gift for imparting education\\"). The record names the donee Mugdha- shivacharya as a disciple of Sadyassivacharya of Arikuta gurukula, which was probably a branch of the Kalamukha sect. It states that Mugdha-shivacharya lived at Elishvara (modern Yeleswaram in Nalgonda district), and survived on a diet of only vegetables. The name of the granted village was Belmoga, which was located in the Ramadu-vishaya (province). It was located to the south of the Urige village, and at the centre of the Tuvatoru, Parivaturla, Pulcheruval, and Potuvodupi villages.

He was also a diplomat in the service of Prussia. He was born in Geneva in 1670, into a family of French Protestants (Huguenots) from Provence, who had fled to Switzerland during the French Wars of Religion and married there into the family of the eminent German Calvinist theologian Friedrich Spanheim. Ludwig- Friedrich Bonnet studied medicine at Leiden University. Both him and his older brother Fr√©d√©ric then followed their uncle Ezekiel von Spanheim into the diplomatic service of the government of Prussia (officially Brandenburg- Prussia until 1701, afterwards the Kingdom of Prussia). Posted to England, he was known there as Louis Frederick Bonet. In London, Bonnet concerned himself with church matters, including the relief of Huguenot refugees. He was a member of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge and received a doctorate of civil law from the University of Oxford in 1706. Bonnet became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1711, having been proposed by John Chamberlayne. He reported extensively to Berlin on contemporary parliamentary and financial matters in England. After his brother Fr√©d√©ric's untimely death in 1694, Ludwig-Friedrich Bonnet succeeded him as \\"resident\\" in London of Brandenburg-Prussia. In 1712, Bonnet sat in the Royal Society's committee that investigated the priority dispute between Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz over the development of the calculus. That committee subscribed a report, which Newton himself had drafted, identifying Newton as \\"first inventor\\" of the calculus and absolving John Keill of libel against another fellow of the Royal Society for having suggested that Leibniz might have taken some of his results from Newton's unpublished letters. In 1713 Bonnet was elected as a foreign member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. Under the terms of the Parliamentary Act of Settlement of 1701, the British throne passed in 1714 to a Protestant German prince, the Elector of Hanover, who reigned as George I of Great Britain. In 1716, the King in Prussia, Frederick William, appointed Bonnet as his ambassador extraordinary to the new British court (the Court of St James's). Bonnet returned to Switzerland in 1720. After 1739 he served in the Grand Council of the Republic of Geneva. He died in Geneva in 1761.

As a redshirt junior, Shojima became the first Japanese-born student-athlete of full Japanese heritage, nationality and citizenship to play in NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) game.  Early years  Shojima was born in Tokyo, Japan to Tatsuhiro and Hiroko Shojima and at age nine, moved to Redondo Beach, California with his family. He grew up learning Shorinji Kempo, an esoteric Japanese martial art in which he holds a black belt in, and was not introduced to American football until he entered high school. On September 30, 2010, he subdued an armed robber at a gas station. Shojima thanks his martial arts background and football experience for this accomplishment.  High school career  Shojima attended Redondo Union High School, a public high school in Redondo Beach, California before transferring to Tokyo Nishi Metropolitan High School in Tokyo, Japan. Upon graduating high school in 2012, he was selected onto the Japanese National football team to compete in the IFAF U-19 World Cup hosted at Austin, Texas from June 30 to July 8.

It is officially declared as object of cultural heritage of Russia of Regional significance. History Katerininskaya (now Krasnodonetskaya stanitsa) was founded in 1775 by the decree of Catherine II. The founder of the village was Prince Grigory Alexandrovich Potemkin. Initially it was situated on the low bank of Donets. The place was chosen unsuccessfully and in spring the village was flooded, so later it was decided to move it downstream. There was built the wooden Church of St. Catherine. Exclusively for the Church of St. Catherine was painted icon of St. Catherine of Alexandria, and the picture had a great resemblance to the Empress Catherine II. In 1835, the village was moved higher to the hills, in 1840 the church was moved there as well and was set on a stone foundation. In 1877, this church completely burned out, and in 1879 a new one was built, with two chapels: the southern one was consecrated in the name of the Ascension of the Lord and the northern one - in the name of Saint Pantaleon. The church was surrounded by a stone fence with wooden bars. The building was constructed of wood, which is not typical for the steppe Southern Russia. Local residents claim that the material for the church were crafted in Siberia, and the logs were numbered and transported to the village from there. In 1886, a parish school was built at the church. Since 1906, the church-parish guardianship began to function. In 1920, Katerininskaya village was renamed Krasnodonetskaya. In 1930‚Äì1940 the church was closed. The domes of the church, both in the main building and the bell tower were cut off. The church was used as a granary. Before the beginning of German occupation, Soviet authorities decided to blow up the church so that the Nazis would not get the grain, but local residents quickly took the grain bags to their homes and so there was no need to blow up any more. During the fighting in the village the church had not been damaged. When the Germans occupied Krasnodonetskya, the church was briefly open again. After the war, the church was closed again. It was locked and stood empty until the mid-1980s and was opened only in 1985. From the modern history of this church, it is known that scenes from two Soviet films - \\"Ataman\\" and \\"Dina\\" - were shot on its background. The Saint Catherine's Church is one of the two remaining churches that are declared as monuments of wooden architecture in the Seversky Donets Basin and objects of cultural heritage of Regional significance.

He collected the humorous tales surrounding the \\"Priest from Kahlenberg\\" (Pfaff vom [or von] Kalenberg), published with a frame story in verse form as Des pfaffen geschicht und histori vom Kalenberg. It was printed as early as 1472 or 1480 in Augsburg. The \\"Priest from Kahlenberg\\" is a folkloristic trickster or prankster figure. A 1490 edition was printed by Heinrich Knoblochtzer in Heidelberg.Pfaff von Kalenberg. Des Pfaffen Geschicht und Histori vom Kalenberg. Auch von dem aller sch√∂nsten Ritter Alexander unnd von seiner sch√∂nen Frawen, Heidelberg, Heinrich Knoblotzer, 1490 (\\"Curiouser and Curiouser\\": A Catalogue of Strange Books and Curious Titles, London, 1932, p. 16). The work was very popular, reprinted well into the 17th century, with translations to Low German, Dutch and English. The figure of the \\"priest from Kahlenberg\\" is also mentioned in the Ship of Fools by Sebastian Brant and in the Till Eulenspiegel chapbook. The figure also inspired the modern narrative poem Der Pfaff vom Kahlenberg by Anastasius Gr√ºn (1850). The Pfaff von Kalenberg character is not named in Frankfurter's text. He is identified as one Gundacker von Thernberg by Ladislaus Sunthaym in 1486/1501. An alternative name for the character, Wigend (also Wigand, Weigand) von Theben is an invention by Wolfgang Lazius, but was reported as the name of the historical character well into the 20th century.Hermann Maschek, \\"Die Geschichte des Pfarrers vom Kahlenberg\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr deutsches Altertum 73 (1936), 33-46, discovered the error and the correct name as reported by Sunthaym.

A large number of ancient buildings, natural landmarks and historic districts are found in the area. In the old city there are buildings of different epochs and architectural styles, including Neo-Byzantine, Stroganov's Baroque, Empire, Modern. These include the medieval Kremlin, 19th- century mansions and Stalinist monumental houses.  Sites  The site contains the following objects # Historic centre of Nizhny Novgorod (downtown); #* The Kremlin; #*Upper Posad; #* Lower Posad; #* Zapochainye; #* Dyatlov Hills; # Historic centre of Kanavino (midtown); #* The Fair; #* The Spit (Strelka); #*Moskovsky railway station and Revolution Square; # Historic centre of Sormovo; #* The Sormovo Factory.  Location  The old city is located on two hills: Kremlevsky and Ilyinsky. On the Kremlevsky hill is the Kremlin itself and the historical districts around it: the Upper and Lower Posads, the Rozhdestvenskaya Side, a complex of historical streets (for example: Bolshaya Pokrovskaya and the Varvarskaya), the Pechersky Monastery, and Pochayna River. On the Ilyinsky hill there is the territory of Zapochainye, starting from Ilinskaya street and ending with the Lyadov Square. The old Kanavino with the Fairground and the old Sormovo are considered part of the old town, despite the fact that these settlements were included in the city after 1917. The old Kanavino includes the territory of the Fair, the Spit and the Gordeevka. There are many landmarks in this territory: the Fair and the Main Fair Building, the Moskovsky railway station with the adjacent square and the Central Department Store, the Smolensk-Vladimir Church in Gordeevka and the Gordeevsky department store, as well as many 19th-century mansions. On the eve of the World Cup in 2018, the territory of the old Kanavino underwent major reconstruction. Old Sormovo is more remote from the historical centre. In the centre of this territory, Stalinist style buildings predominate but there are a few pre-revolutionary buildings: the Transfiguration Cathedral, Barricade School, Krasnoye Sormovo Factory and some 19th-century mansions. At the beginning of the 20th century, Sormovo was the centre of revolutionary battles in 1905, because of this, many revolutionary monuments are located on this territory.

The term Waldlerhaus goes back to the 19th century and describes the house of a person who lives in and from the forest. Its distribution area is bounded by the edges of the Bavarian and Upper Palatine Forests. The boundary of the associated cultural- historical region has been complicated by recent history. Until the Second World War the area of the lower Bavarian Forest, the M√ºhlviertel in Austria and the southern Bohemian Forest in present-day Czech Republic, formed one large unit. This means there is also a difficulty in determining its boundary with the Bohemian Forest house (B√∂hmerwaldhaus), which occurs in the Czech Republic and in the \\"≈†umava\\", the Czech part of the Bohemian Forest.  Description  The wood-panelled upper storey and roof balcony is a typical element The Waldlerhaus is usually a poor person's house The Waldlerhaus is, as a rule, a single-ridge house (Einfirsthaus) with a gable roof. They are mostly small one- or two-storey unit farmhouses with a cattle shed at the back. A barn is usually built onto the end. The ground floor may be made of stone. The knee wall (Kniestock) or upper storeys are usually made of wood. Stone-weighted shakes formed the original roof coverings; later replaced by interlocking tiles (Falzziegel). The broad eaves of the roof were designed for with the high levels of precipitation in the low mountains in mind. They offered good drainage of rainwater and dry open-air storage. In switching the roofing to tiles, the roof pitch often had to be increased, something that can easily be seen from the beams on the roof ridge. Tiles were favoured in the 20th century because they reduced fire insurance premiums. The house entrance is almost always on the eaves side. In the Bavarian Forest Museum Village, however, there are several houses with an entrance at the gable end. In front of the main door is the so-called Gred, a usually cobbled, rain-protected path along the eaves side. The house door opens into a corridor, the so-called Flez. The first door towards the gable leads immediately into the living room or Stube, which is usually square, with two windows in the gable and a door on the eaves side. On the gable end on the upper floor, rarely on the eaves side, it is common to have a balcony called the Gang or Schrot. This balcony is very often boarded for up to a few square metres, probably as protection against the rigours of the harsh climate. The king post (Firsts√§ule) is one of the few decorative elements, but also fulfils the function as a means of hanging up various things. The eaves side of the upper storey is also used externally. The bracket beams (Konsolbalken) were adapted so that boards, rods, ladders and the like could be stored here in the dry. In the forest areas there were rarely wealthy farmers. As a result, the Waldlerhaus is often small. The smallest ones are called Sacherl or G√ºtl. A Waldlerhaus is also used in many larger farms as an Austragshaus for the older generation, as they hand over the farm.

According to a legend recorded in the Lithuanian Chronicles, it was where Lithuanian rulers were cremated before the Christianization of Lithuania in 1387. Maciej Stryjkowski further recorded that it was the location of a pagan temple dedicated to Perk≈´nas, the god of thunder. While the legends are generally dismissed as fiction by historians, they been studied and analyzed from the perspective of pagan Lithuanian mythology by Vladimir Toporov, Gintaras Beresneviƒçius, Norbertas Vƒólius, Vykintas Vaitkeviƒçius, and others. Legend Duke ≈†ventaragis (from the legendary Palemonids dynasty) selected a beautiful location in a valley at the confluence of Neris and Vilnia Rivers and ordered his son Skirmantas to establish a temple where he would be cremated after his death. He also ordered other Lithuanian dukes and nobles to be cremated here. Some years later, Grand Duke Gediminas was on a hunt and stopped in the valley. There he had a dream about a howling Iron Wolf which pagan priest Lizdeika interpreted that Gediminas should built the capital of Lithuania at this location. Thus, Gediminas became the founder of Vilnius. The legends, as recorded by the Lithuanian Chronicles, do not mention any kind of temple at the location. Historiography These legends were retold and elaborated upon by various historians, including Maciej Stryjkowski and Teodor Narbutt, and became very popular. In his work, published in 1582, Stryjkowski elaborated that the valley has a temple dedicated to Perk≈´nas, the god of thunder, maintained an eternal flame, and was located where Vilnius Cathedral stands today. Narbutt, citing the dubious Chronicle of Rivius, even provided a description of the temple's measurements and the rituals performed within. There is a continued academic debate whether the legends were rooted in a historical fact that there was a pagan temple in Vilnius. A pagan temple, demolished and replaced by a Catholic church, was mentioned in a 1388 papal bull of Pope Urban VI. However, the papal bull is vague in its wording and the descriptions of King Jogaila's actions are similar to those in the Book of Deuteronomy (12:3‚Äì4). In 1980s, archaeological research by Napaleonas Kitkauskas and Albertas Lisanka uncovered remnants of an earlier square structure under the present-day Vilnius Cathedral. Historians proposed that it was the remnants of a cathedral built by King Mindaugas after his conversion and coronation in 1253. They further argued that, after Mindaugas' assassination, this cathedral was converted into a pagan temple. However, in 2010, Gediminas Vaitkeviƒçius published a monograph in which he dated the remnants to 1300‚Äì1320 based on artifacts found at the site. This dating is supported by the Letters of Gediminas (written in 1323‚Äì1324) that mention a newly built church. Kitkauskas rejected Vaitkeviƒçius' arguments.

The four rites of passage celebrated in this tradition are the coming of age (Gwallye; Hangul: Í¥ÄÎ°Ä), marriage (Hollye; Hangul: ÌòºÎ°Ä), death, or the funeral rites (Sangrye; Hangul: ÏÉÅÎ°Ä), and rites venerating the ancestors (Jerye; Hangul: Ï†úÎ°Ä). The word Gwanhonsangje (Hangul: Í¥ÄÌòºÏÉÅÏ†ú) is a generic term made up of the first letter of each word (gwallye, hollye, sangrye, jerye).  History  The word Gwanhonsangje (ÂÜ†Â©öÂñ™Á•≠)' was first used in the classic book Ye-gi (ÏòàÍ∏∞Á¶ÆË®ò), and has since been used in many other works describing various rites. Similar weddings and other practices have been observed since the period of the Three Kingdoms., although it is unclear whether the concept of a Confucian wedding ceremony was firmly established at that time. There are brief records of weddings and practices evoking the Chinese example, but the exact form this took is not clear. = Three Kingdoms = In Goguryeo (Hangul: Í≥†Íµ¨Î†§) at one time, a man would work at the house of a married woman for a certain period. Goguryeo had a custom of preparing funeral goods and conducting funeral rites to the accompaniment of music. Other customs established in the past included singing to mark the end of the period of mourning after death, and wearing mourning for three years. In Silla (Hangul: Ïã†Îùº), it is surmised from records showing that partners bowed to each other, and held a feast after the ceremony that there was a ritual similar to the Confucian wedding. According to the text ÏÇºÍµ≠ÏßÄ‰∏âÂúãÂøó (the Records of the Three Kingdoms, È≠èÂøó Êù±Â§∑ÂÇ≥), in this part of Korea at that time, there was a fixed period for the wearing of mourning dress and holding of funeral rites. Also in Silla (Hangul: Ïã†Îùº), burial on the burial grounds was banned for a period of five years during the reign of King Jijeung, when the mourning law was established. In Baekje (Hangul: Î∞±Ï†ú), rites were similar to those observed in Goguryeo. Thus, during the Three Kingdoms period, the traditional wedding ceremony was similar to the Confucian rites. = Goryeo = In the early Goryeo period (Hangul: Í≥†Î†§), pictures from the Song dynasty relating to the Confucian rites were delivered to Goryeo. During the reign of Goryeo dynasty king Seongjong, the major institutions of the kingdom were reorganized according to the Confucian system, and Chinese Confucian rituals were imported at this time. It appears that Confucian-style practices were only followed by the upper class, with no systematic observance by the general population. The Confucian rites began to spread, with active acceptance of one of the Chinese texts on etiquette, Í∞ÄÎ°ÄÂÆ∂Á¶Æ, by officials of the later phase of the Goryeo dynasty. = Joseon = The Joseon dynasty (Hangul: Ï°∞ÏÑ†) adopted Neo-Confucianism as its ruling ideology, and the institution of Gwanhonsangje was established as a Confucian system. Various policies were implemented to establish the system of Confucian rites. As a result, books relating to etiquette (ÏòàÏÑúÁ¶ÆÊõ∏) written in the Joseon style began to appear from the early 16th century. The government also made it mandatory for bureaucrats to sit a test on the ritual. Notably, codes concerning institutions and ceremonies were compiled during the Joseon era, and these institutions and ceremonies were made a part of the education system. In the 16th and 17th centuries, thanks to the academic work of scholars, the Korean stage-of-life rituals became generalized, under the name of Gwanhonsangje. More than 200 books were published; evidence of Joseon interest in the lifelong ceremony. Of note is the fact that the Gwanhonsangje ceremony of the Joseon dynasty did not simply follow the Chinese example, but rather adapted it to the Joseon context. After the Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592, Gwanhonsangje became a universal rite of passage. At the end of the Joseon Dynasty, the arrival of Western culture saw the beginnings of change in the traditional ritual. = Japanese rule = In 1934, the Governor-General of Korea modified Gwanhonsangje, declaring a \\"rite rule\\" which forced the simplification of rituals in the name of modernization. This rule did not acknowledge Gwallye, only recognizing Hollye, Sangrye, and Jerye as formal ceremonies. = Today = The changes to daily life brought about by industrialization and urbanization led to societal acceptance of many changes to the rituals, including shorter funeral and mourning rites, and a reduction in the number of services. The wedding ceremony became an event and, accordingly, planned weddings grew in importance. Funeral directors emerged as a new profession, with funeral halls and funeral companies fulfilling the customary requirements. The advent of memorial service agencies gave rise to the memorial service. These new professional service providers take over the role of the individual in the practice of the rite, ensuring the smooth progress of proceedings even where the individual is inexperienced in the method or procedures of the rite. With these changes, various religious rituals are entering an era of diversity.  The Four Ceremonial Occasions  Korean hairpin - Binyeo = Gwallye = This practice is one of the ceremonies held in the East Asian countries that follow the Confucian cultural tradition (China, Korea, Vietnam, and Japan). It developed from the coming-of-age ceremony in which primitive societies recognized minors as adults. Gwallye celebrationsare usually held for a man between the ages of 15 and 20, and a woman over the age of 15. Although the man or woman is still single, he or she is treated as an adult after the ceremony.  Traditional Gwallye  The meaning of coming of age is defined in the classic Asian book on manners, the YeSeo (Hangul: ÏòàÏÑú): ‚Äúto awaken responsibility as an adult, and its purpose is to make one perform one‚Äôs duties.‚Äù Gwallye (Hangul: Í¥ÄÎ°Ä; Hanja: ÂÜ†Á¶Æ) and Gyelye (Hangul: Í≥ÑÎ°Ä; Hanja: Á≠ìÁ¶Æ) refer to the annual ritual, which is a coming of age ceremony (Hangul: ÏÑ±ÎÖÑÎ°Ä) awakening a child's development to maturity and granting him or her responsibilities and duties as an adult. To mark the Gwallye ceremony, a man, on reaching an age between 15 and 20, ties his hair in a topknot (Hangul: ÏÉÅÌà¨) and puts on a crown. In the Gyelye ritual, a woman who is over the age of 15 takes on an adult appearance by wearing a binyeo (Hangul: ÎπÑÎÖÄ), or ornamental hairpin, along with other sorts of attire. Today, the traditional gwallye and gyelye ceremonies have virtually disappeared, and are seldom performed. In the modern era, the third Monday of May is designated the 'Coming-of-Age Day', and on this occasion governments and organizations conduct annual 'Adult Day' events.Ïù¥ÏßÑÍ≥§, „ÄéÏïÑÏ£º ÏâΩÍ≤å Î≥¥Îäî Í¥ÄÌòºÏÉÅÏ†ú„Äè, Ïî®Ïï§ÌÜ°, 2014, p.9-p.10  Modern coming of age  Until the mid-20th century, most traditional coming of age ceremonies took the form of inviting new adults to the homes or village when they reached the age of 20. With industrialization and urbanization, these traditional customs fell out of use. To counter the disappearance of this rite, instil pride in traditional culture and teach the social meaning of the traditional ceremony celebrating the transition to adulthood, a modern coming-of-age celebration model has been developed. From 1999, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism was the lead proponent of this model. Since 2014, the official ceremony has been organized by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family. The civil law reform of 2013 lowered the age of majority from 20 to 19. When young people reach the age of 19, the relevant unit within the Ministry brings them together, and the president of each organization hosts a simple event. Today, the traditional coming of age celebration event is hosted by Sungkyunkwan University. Other than the official ceremonies organized by the state, few special ceremonies held in the home to celebrate coming of age. The practice is to offer greetings or a gift to the person reaching adulthood. Generally, friends celebrate on Coming of Age Day with a gift of roses, perfumes, kisses, or according to each person's request. Roses symbolize ongoing passion and love, and at the traditional age of 20 (now 19), 20 roses were given to mark the person's age. Perfume symbolizes good memories, represented in the form of scents. Kissing symbolizes a responsible love, accompanying the attainment of maturity with adulthood.  Organizing body  The annual modern Coming of Age Day celebration was originally hosted by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. On September 6, 2006, this role was transferred to the National Youth Commission. The National Youth Commission was replaced by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in 2008, when the department was reorganized. In March, 2010, the department changed again. From 2014, the agency was assigned to the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family. = Hollye = Hollye is the name for the Confucian wedding procedure. In earlier times, the age for marriage was 30 for men and 20 for women. In modern times, marriage has been permitted from age 15 for men and 14 for women (under some circumstances as young as 12). Today, people usually marry at 20 or later.Korean wedding - Hollye  Traditional Wedding  Uihon (Hangul: ÏùòÌòº; Hanja: Ë≠∞Â©ö) is a ritual in which the families of the bride and the bridegroom consider the appearance, education and personality of the marriage partner. If the two parties reach agreement, they approve the marriage. This is called myeonyag (Hangul: Î©¥ÏïΩ; Hanja: Èù¢Á¥Ñ). In principle, marriage is agreed to by consent of both sets of parents. However, the wedding may only proceed if the couple do not share the same surname and family origin (Hangul: ÎèôÏÑ±ÎèôÎ≥∏), and provided that it will not take place during the one-year span of a mourning period.Ïù¥ÏßÑÍ≥§, „ÄéÏïÑÏ£º ÏâΩÍ≤å Î≥¥Îäî Í¥ÄÌòºÏÉÅÏ†ú„Äè, Ïî®Ïï§ÌÜ°, 2014, p.14-p.15 Nabchae (Hangul: ÎÇ©Ï±Ñ; Hanja: Á¥çÈáá) is the term that designates the sending of a letter from the groom's house to the bride 's house, bearing the groom's saju (Hangul: ÏÇ¨Ï£º).Ïù¥ÏßÑÍ≥§, „ÄéÏïÑÏ£º ÏâΩÍ≤å Î≥¥Îäî Í¥ÄÌòºÏÉÅÏ†ú„Äè, Ïî®Ïï§ÌÜ°, 2014, p.16-p.17 Korean wedding - Honrye-Pyebaek Yanji (Hangul: Ïó∞Í∏∏; Hanja: Ê∂ìÂêâ) refers to the setting of a wedding date by the bride's house, and its communication to the groom's house, in response to a letter of proposal, or saseong (Hangul: ÏÇ¨ÏÑ±), sent by the bridegroom. Nabpye (Hangul: ÎÇ©Ìèê; Hanja: Á¥çÂπ£) designates the bridegroom sending a box called a ham (Hangul: Ìï®) to the bride's house the day before the wedding ceremony, covering wedding expenses. The procedure of sending funds to the bride's house to cover wedding expenses, accompanied by a marriage letter in the ham, is an expression of gratitude for the approval of the marriage.Ïù¥ÏßÑÍ≥§, „ÄéÏïÑÏ£º ÏâΩÍ≤å Î≥¥Îäî Í¥ÄÌòºÏÉÅÏ†ú„Äè, Ïî®Ïï§ÌÜ°, 2014, p.20-p.22 Chinyeong (Hangul: ÏπúÏòÅ; Hanja: Ë¶™Ëøé) describes the bridegroom going to the bride's house, where the ceremony is held, and bringing the bride with him. This is the first ceremony in which a bridegroom is present in the bride's house. Jeonanlye (Hangul: Ï†ÑÏïàÎ°Ä; Hanja: Â•†ÈõÅÁ¶Æ) is a ritual in which the bride and her family greet the bridegroom and hold the wedding, daelye (Hangul: ÎåÄÎ°Ä). Cholye (Hangul: Ï¥àÎ°Ä; Hanja: ÈÜÆÁ¶Æ) is the ritual in which the bride and groom meet for the first time and are united in wedlock.Ïù¥ÏßÑÍ≥§, „ÄéÏïÑÏ£º ÏâΩÍ≤å Î≥¥Îäî Í¥ÄÌòºÏÉÅÏ†ú„Äè, Ïî®Ïï§ÌÜ°, 2014, p.25-p.27  Stages  The stages of the traditional marriage rites are as follows: # Saju-danja (Hangul: ÏÇ¨Ï£ºÎã®Ïûê; Hanja: ÂõõÊü±ÂñÆÂ≠êÔºöÊü±ÂñÆ) ‚Äï When the marriage agreement is made, the groom sends the date of his birth on a blank sheet to the home of the bride-to-be. # Taek- il (Hangul: ÌÉùÏùº; Hanja: ÊìáÊó•) ‚Äï In the woman's house, the wedding date is chosen, and is then sent to the groom's home. The method echoes the sending out of the Saju-danja. # Uiyang-danja (Hangul: ÏùòÏñëÎã®Ïûê; Hanja: Ë°£Ê®£ÂñÆÂ≠ê) ‚Äï The groom's house replies, sending the groom's clothes and shoe sizes and other details. Such details for the bride are generally sent included with the Taek-il danja. # Nabpye (Hangul: ÎÇ©Ìèê; Hanja: Á¥çÂπ£) ‚Äï The day before the wedding, Seoga (Hangul: ÏÑúÍ∞Ä) put Honseo (Hangul: ÌòºÏÑúl; Hanja: Â©öÊõ∏) and Chaedan (Hangul: Ï±ÑÎã®; Hanja: Á∂µÁ∑û) at Ham (Hangul: Ìï®; Hanja: ÂáΩ) and send this to the bride's home. The bride's family receives the Hamjinabi,opens the Hamand offers greetings. # Gosadang (Hangul: Í≥†ÏÇ¨Îãπ; Hanja: ÂëäÁ•ÄÂ†Ç) ‚Äï Following the engagement, and before the Nabpye, the syzygy day is chosen and the parties go to the Sadangto offer prayers for a perfect wedding. # Chorye (Hangul: Ï¥àÎ°Ä; Hanja: ÈÜÆÁ¶Æ) ‚Äï The groom makes the necessary preparations for the wedding at the bride's home. This usually takes 3 days, but if the distance is not great, the day after performing Hyungugoryethe groom returns to the bride's home and spends 3 days. # Hyungugorye(Hangul:ÌòÑÍµ¨Í≥†Î°Ä; Hanja: Ë¶ãËàÖÂßëÁ¶Æ) ‚Äï This is the occasion at which the bride meets the groom's parents and their cousins. Then groom's parents respond by giving presents. # Ìï¥ÌòÑÎ°Ä (Hanja: Ëß£Ë¶ãÁ¶Æ) ‚Äï Usually called Sinburyeor Pulbogi, this is the process whereby the bride goes to the groom's home after the bridal chamber. The bride's family hosting the bride and groom is called Jaehang. Chinyoung is the procedure during which the groom greets the bride and brings her to his home for the wedding. Dongsangrye is the groom's stag party on the night of the wedding.

Similar to the beliefs held in many societies, death is believed to be more than the ceasing of biological activity, and to involve the soul's transitioning from this world to another. These concepts are reflected in certain acts of the Sangrye ceremony, which can take many different forms in South Korean practice Among conventionally practiced types of Sangrye ceremony are Shamanistic Sangrye, Buddhist Sangrye, Confucian-style Sangrye, and Christian Sangrye. These variants may also be combined. Today, Confucian-style Sangrye is more commonly practiced, and is considered the most traditional form. = Jerye = In early times, humans were in awe of the changes in nature, and believed. that people would only survive and flourish if they acted in harmony with those natural changes, such as the cycle of the seasons. They also thought that all things were filled with spirit. Based on this understanding and conjecture, they began praying for human safety and wellbeing. Since those times, with the development of civilization, the ceremony has become more formalized, and this is also referred to in Confucianism as Jerye (Hangul: Ï†úÎ°Ä). Korean Royal Ancestral Rite - Jongmyo Jerye Jerye is a courtesy term covering the holding of many ancestral rites, and is a statement of etiquette concerning ancestor worship. Among the various kinds of Jerye are Gije, Seeje, and Myoje. Jerye (Hanja: Á•≠Á¶Æ)Îäî is an act of expressing sincerity by offering sacrifices of food to the spirit, the soul of the dead, and to demons, including the god. In East Asian culture with a Chinese influence, the ceremony for New Year, or Chuseok, is called Chalye (Hangul: Ï∞®Î°Ä). In a narrow sense, it expresses devotion to the god in East Asian Chinese-influenced culture. In broad terms, it refers to all of the rituals involving the offering of sacrifice, relating to shamanism, ancestor worship, and animism. The following foods are prohibited at a memorial ceremony and may not be served or placed on ritual tables: * Peaches * Fish such as the Pacific saury, hawk, and mackerel * Red bean * Foods containing pepper or garlic sauce According to traditional belief and rules still applied, the ghosts hate red and garlic. There is also a rule that a man wearing a hanbok and making a sacrifice should wear full Korean dress (Hangul: ÎèÑÌè¨) and the traditional Korean overcoat (Hangul: ÎëêÎ£®ÎßàÍ∏∞).  Ancient rules  The following rules originate in, or are derived from, an ancient Jerye event (Hangul: Ï†úÏÇ¨ÏôÄ Í¥ÄÎ†®Îêú ÏÇ¨ÏûêÏÑ±Ïñ¥): * ÌôçÎèôÎ∞±ÏÑú (Hanja: Á¥ÖÊù±ÁôΩË•ø) - Red fruits are placed to the east, white fruits to the west. * Ïñ¥ÎèôÏú°ÏÑú (Hanja: È≠öÊù±ËÇâË•ø) - Fish is placed to the east, meat to the west. * Ï°∞Ïú®Ïù¥Ïãú (Hanja: Ê£óÊ†óÊ¢®Êûæ) - Jujube, chestnut, pear, and persimmon are placed in order. * ÎëêÎèôÎØ∏ÏÑú (Hanja: È†≠Êù±Â∞æË•ø) - Fish should be aligned with the head facing east and the tail to the west. * ÏÇ¨ÏûêÎ∞òÏÉù (Hanja: Ê≠ªËÄÖÂèçÁîü) - The image of a dead person is placed opposite to a living person. * Ï¢åÏÑúÏö∞Îèô (Hanja: Â∑¶Ë•øÂè≥Êù±) - The ancestral tablet should be placed on the east side, with its left side to the west and its right side to the east. * ÎÇ®Ï¢åÏó¨Ïö∞ (Hanja: Áî∑Â∑¶Â•≥Âè≥) - Men bow on the left; women bow on the right.  Modern Ancestral Rites  Funerals typically take place over three days, with different rites performed on each day. First day: on the day a person dies, the body is moved to a funeral hall. Clothes are prepared for the body, which is laid in repose in a chapel. Food is then prepared for the deceased. This takes the form of three bowls of rice and three kinds of Korean side dish. There must also be three coins, and three straw shoes. This step may be cancelled depending on the religion of the deceased's family's. Second day: the funeral director washes the body and shrouding is done. A family member places uncooked rice in the mouth of the deceased person. (This step may not be performed, depending on the family's religion.) The body is then transferred into a coffin. Family members, including close relatives, wear mourning dress. Typically, mourning dress for a woman includes Korean traditional attire, or Hanbok, and for a man includes a suit. Clothing must be black. The ritual ceremony begins after the clothes have been changed and foods prepared for the deceased. Details of the ceremony differ according to the family's religion. After the ritual ceremony, family members greet the guests. Third day: the family decides whether the body will be buried or cremated. If burial is chosen, three members of the family sprinkle dirt on the coffin three times. If the body is cremated, there are no specific actions to perform. The only requirement is an urn to hold the ashes and a place in which the urn will be kept. People who come to the funeral bring condolence money. A food called Yukgaejang is served to guests, often accompanied with the Korean alcoholic beverage soju. Columnist Hwang gyo-ig has made the criticism that there are no seasonal foods in the current ceremony. The current priesthood is not a tradition that has been handed down from the past, but rather dates from the Korean War. In addition, some Protestants and Muslims reject it as idol worship. In Catholicism, after the decision of Pius XII to accept communion, the priest makes sacrifice without new wine. This is often replaced, however, with a prayer. Buddhism is increasingly entrusting memorial services to temples.

Excavated in Chencang District of Baoji, Shaanxi during the Daoguang era (1821-1851) of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), it is on display in the National Museum of China in Beijing. The Guoji Zibai pan is the largest known bronze plate in the world. It enjoys the reputation of the best bronzeware in the Western Zhou dynasty (1046 BC-771 BC). The Guoji Zibai pan, the San Family Plate (), and the Mao Gong ding, are known as the \\"Three Important Bronzewares in the Western Zhou dynasty\\". Description The rectangular Guoji Zibai pan resembles a bathtub. It is high, long, and wide. It weighs . The four corners are regular fillets and the four feet are all in rectangular shape, and hidden at the bottom of the plate making the mouth of the plate appear large while the bottom small. On each wall outside of the plate, there are two beast heads with rings in the mouths, and decorative patterns in the shape of ware band. Inscription According to the inscription, the Guoji Zibai pan was cast by Guoji Zibai (), a nobleman in the Western Guo State (1046 BC-687 BC) in the Western Zhou dynasty (1046 BC-771 BC). The plate was cast in 816 BC, the 12th year of King Xuan of Zhou. Guoji was a major branch of the Guo lineage that ruled the Western Guo, and Zibai was his courtesy name. According to the inscription on the plate, in the 12 year of King Xuan of Zhou, also the year of 816 BC, Guoji Zibai was appointed by King Xuan to lead the army to battle with the nomadic tribe Xianyun in the north shore of Luo River, and gained a complete victory. Guoji Zibai cut the enemy's ears off and offered it to the King Xuan, King Xuan held a grand ceremony to honor his achievement and bestowed him a lot of horses and weapons to praise him. Guoji Zibai specially cast the bronze ware to memorize the military operation and honor. The plate was cast in 816 BC, and the writing technique of the inscription on the plate was very similar to those of the Classic of Poetry, which was the earliest collection of poetry in China. Function In ancient China, water held in small plates was used for washing hands and faces, and in large plates it was used for baths. The rings on the outside walls of the plate were probably designed for carrying the plate to pour water conveniently. the Guoji Zibai pan was large, heavy and inconvenient to use in daily life. It seemed that it was more suitable to hold things in a large volume, just like Jian (), which was used to hold ice cube in ancient China. According to the set of etiquette at that time, when a high-ranking official died, his body should stay in the mortuary for seven days. In summer, ice was a must to prevent the body from decaying. Therefore, maybe the plate was a container used for holding ice cubes. But there has been no authoritative final conclusion about the exact usage of the plate in the academic circle. Discovery =Qing dynasty= Liu Mingchuan (1836-1896), the third owner of the Guoji Zibai pan who protected it between 1864 and 1896 Weng Tonghe (1830-1904), scholar and Minister of Revenue, who coveted the Guoji Zibai pan According to Prefecture Records of Luzhou (), the Guoji Zibai pan was unearthed at Guochuansi of Baoji, Shaanxi, in the Daoguang period (1821-1851) of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). Xu Xiejun (), the then magistrate of Mei County, purchased the plate for silver from a local peasant. And he brought the plate to his house \\"Tianyou Hall\\" (). In April 1860, it fell into the hands of Chen Kunshu and became the treasure of the Mansion of Prince Protector. In May 1864, namely the 3rd year of Tongzhi period of Qing dynasty, Liu Mingchuan (1836-1896), general of the Huai Army, led the troops of Qing Empire to fight with the Taiping Army, and finally liberated Changzhou. When Liu moved into the mansion, his soldiers didn't know the plate and used it as a manger. One night when reading a book under the oil lamp, Liu heard clear metal clanks from out of the window. All was quiet at dead of night, so the clanks sounded clear and loud. Liu came to the stable following the sounds, and saw that a horse was eating grass with the bronze rings on the headstall hitting the manger from time to time to make the clanks. Liu was so curious that he bent to look carefully with the lantern, and found the manger wide and deep with fuzzy decorative patterns on its four sides. Liu tried to push the manger but failed. It was very unusual and he decided to check it out after the dawn. The next day he ordered his attendants to carry out the manger and wash it. The bronze ware was very exquisite and Liu was very fond of it. He immediately sent his trusted followers to transport the manger to his hometown, Hefei in Anhui. Liu specially invited Huang Congmo () who was familiar with ancient Chinese characters to help him research the bronze ware. Huang told him that most of bronze plates discovered in the past were round, and rectangular bronze ware was very rare, and such a large and rectangular plate was even more scarce and, or even might be the only one of its kind. And the inscription clearly showed that the bronze plate was cast by Guoji Zibai of the Western Guo State. After Liu understood the story of the manger he decided to protect it. Liu specially built an exquisite pavilion in his house, which he named \\"Plate Pavilion\\" () to preserve the plate. Huang made a piece of rubbing from its inscription and copied a lot of copies. Huang sold it on the market. Weng Tonghe (1830-1904), a collector and teacher of Guangxu Emperor, wanted to buy the plate but Liu refused. Weng told the Empress Dowager Cixi on Liu Mingchuan and complained about that. But Liu's superior Li Hongzhang explained that. Empress Dowager Cixi decreed to bestow the plate on Liu Mingchuan. In 1885 he was appointed the first provincial governor of Taiwan by the Qing government, a position he held for almost ten years until his retirement. From then on he lived a retiring life and didn't care about national affairs any more. The plate became his spiritual ballast in his declining years. In 1894, the Qing army were routed in the First Sino-Japanese War and the Qing government was forced to sign the \\"Treaty of Shimonoseki\\". When hearing the news, Liu was furious that he became illness suddenly and died with indignation. Before he died, he told his children again and again that the plate was a national treasure and they should protect it even risking their lives. =Republic era= In 1911, the Xinhai Revolution was broke out, China was torn by warlords. Some warlords began to covet all kinds of national treasures that they knew heard of. The Guoji Zibai pan in the Liu Family was no exception. In May 1933, the then governor of Anhui Liu Zhenhua came to Liu's home in the name of visiting the descendant of Liu Mingchuan. When meeting Liu Suzeng (), the fourth generation-son of Liu Mingchuan. Liu Zhenhua first flattered him with a beaming face, then he changed the topic, saying that he want to see the plate. Liu Suzeng said calmly that his ancestors did actually collect a plate, but they had never seen it. Liu Zhenhua suddenly turned hostile and commanded his soldiers to search the house. They searched everywhere but found nothing there. Liu Zhenhua sent spies to watch every movement of the Liu Family in the hope of finding where the plate was. The Liu Family spent the next four year in fear and trembling. In 1937, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident was broke out, the Japanese army soon colonised the north China. After occupying Hefei, the Japanese army set a stronghold less than away from the Liu Family. Soon after, they sent a message to the Liu Family that they would like to change a golden plate of the same size for the Guoji Zibai pan. Liu Suzeng answered immediately that they didn't have any treasure and if they had, they didn't want to be unworthy descendant, or the bad apples of the country to sell it to foreigners. Liu Suzeng thought it over and over and finally hit upon a good idea, they dug a big hole in their yard, and buried the plate in the hole and planted a little locust tree on it. In order to avoid the danger, the Liu Family moved to other places with same personal belongings at night to seek asylum. When the Japanese heard this, they made a wide and sweeping search of the Liu's house but found nothing. Finally, they set a fire on more than 30 buildings and than left. After the surrender of Japan, the Liu Family returned to home. Li Pinxian (1892-1987), a KMT general and the then governor of Anhui, ordered Liu Suzeng to hand over the plate, but Liu refused. A few days later, Li Pinxian deliberately said that Liu had stolen the box full of gold bars, and forced Liu to write the iou. The Liu Family had to flee their home to seek asylum again. Li Pinxian came to Liu's house with his troops, they looked around the house and dug the yard to a depth of three feet but found nothing. =People's Republic era= In October 1949, after the establishment of the Communist State, the Ministry of Culture asked official from all over the country to rescue the treasures of cultural relics scattered from the folk. Wu Guichang (), chief of the CPC Feixi County Committee, heard the news that the Guoji Zibai pan is preserved in the Liu Family. Wu went to Liu's house many times and asked Liu Suzeng to donate the cultural relic to the country. Guo Chongyi (), a local member of the Chinese Democratic League, came to Liu's home with a document of the Central Government. After reading the document and talking with Guo Chongyi, Liu Suzeng decided to donate the treasure to the new country with a bronze drum of the Three Kingdoms period (220-280) together. On February 28, 1950, the Liu Family officially donated the plate to the Ministry of Culture. The government awarded Liu a certificate of praise and honor. Till then, the Guoji Zibai pan had accompanied the Liu Family for 86 years and been passed down by four generations. The Ministry of Culture gave the treasure to the National Museum of Chinese History. Later, the National Museum of Chinese History gave the relic to the National Museum of China. The Guoji Zibai pan has always been kept there since that time.

After reaching out to companies, he soon found out there were only a few options that offered a door-to-door courier service. Additionally, the companies that did offer these types of services were found to be rather expensive for a student budget. The company started as a way to tackle the difficulty of accessing courier services in an easy and fast way. What started as a simple solution for door- to-door shipping services in Europe, catering mainly to the needs of students and expats, had soon developed into a platform primarily for businesses, that offers comprehensive shipping services, ranging from parcel shipping, to freight, dedicated van delivery and solutions for relocation and removals.NEW LOW COST COURIER BOOKING ENGINE EUROSENDER LAUNCHES IN IRELAND, Irish Tech News = Expansion = In May 2014, Eurosender received an initial investment of ‚Ç¨25,000 from the media company ProSiebenSat.1. This initial investment and network built through the accelerator proved vital in establishing market presence in key European markets and allowed Eurosender to expand its concept to include B2B customers. The company's activities remain focused on Portugal and Spain during this year. With the investment of ‚Ç¨300,000 from German multinational insurance company ERGO Group in May 2016, Eurosender became an integrated provider of package insurance for deliveries processed through the platform.Stanislava Vab≈°ek, German insurance giant ERGO invested into Eurosender, Startup.si During this year, Eurosender was able to expand its business to Croatia, Poland, Greece, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Eurosender has been consistently building upon their vision of empowering businesses to handle their logistics more efficiently and gain access to a wider array of transportation services, going granular and collaborating with micro and medium scale logistics companies. In 2017, Eurosender received a ‚Ç¨2 million investment from Post Luxembourg in order to help them further expand their services and grow on a bigger scale.  Present  Eurosender is striving to become a holistic logistics platform with a sophisticated supply-chain network that, in addition to meeting the common logistics demand, is also able to cater to the specialized transportation needs of any business that operates in highly regulated industries and under temperature-controlled regimes. With currently over 150.000+ active private and business users, Eurosender is expanding at a fast pace and will be doing more so in the near future. = Offices = Eurosender currently employs over 70+ people in all of its locations.

Ever since its launch in 2014, Eurosender quickly negotiated partnerships with all major European couriers, being able to negotiate lower prices with the logistics service providers for their customers. However, to meet all the specific needs of its customers, Eurosender started working with smaller businesses operating in the logistics field. Through this, less accessible routes become available via Eurosender and at the same time, smaller businesses are helped by complementing the already existing volume they have. Eurosender distinguishes between private users and business users and adapts its services to each own need. There is especially a big focus on business users, for whom repetitive processes are being digitized to scale and made faster. Eurosender offers a unified logistics solution to many businesses across industries. This is made possible with their advanced application software to re-engineer obsolete logistics operations and create delivery management software for companies around the world. = Modes of transportation = Eurosender offers shipping services with the use of transport via air, sea or road.

From 1872, he served a pupilage of three years to S. W. Jenkin, during which he was engaged in connection with the parliamentary and working plans and sections of several branch lines for the Cornwall Minerals Railway, the Fal Valley Railway and the Truro and Penzance Railway. For one year from 1875 to 1876, he was a student at the School of Practical Engineering at Crystal Palace under W. J. Wilson. In 1876 he went to India, however, failing to obtain employment as an engineer, he became a pupil of H. Whymper, of the Murree Brewery, and was occupied for fifteen months on the water supply for the Murree Brewery Company in the Punjab.Minutes of the Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers, E-ISSN 1753-7843, Volume 99, Issue 1890, Part 1, 1890, pp. 376-377. Subsequently, he proceeded to Calcutta, where he was engaged by Mitchell and Co., engineers and contractors, of which he became a partner in 1881. He was first employed in building bungalows, machine-shops, engine-sheds for the Northern Bengal State Railway at Saidpore, and afterwards, during the year 1879, was in charge of the construction of 10 miles of the Darjeeling Steam Tramway. He was also concerned in the making of a road through the Teesta Valley and on the Bengal Central Railway, the Calcutta drainage works, the Dacca and Mymensing Railway, and the Patna and Bankipore Tramway.

Background  During the Siege of Leningrad the Soviets moved supplies to the city through Lake Ladoga. The Axis deployed the Finnish Ladoga Naval Detachment, Naval Detachment K (including the Italian XII Squadriglia MAS), and the German Luftwaffe Einsatzstab F√§hre Ost, to interdict the route;Kijanen, Kalervo (1968).

The culmination of Axis operations was the raid against Sukho Island, 20 km from the southern shore of the lake, which covered supply lines and the approaches to Soviet bases. Axis forces The attack was commanded by Oberstleutnant Wachtel. The flotilla was composed of 16 Siebel ferries, 7 infantry boats, and the Italian motor torpedo boat MAS-526. Seven ferries (SF-11, SF-13, SF-15, SF-17, SF-21, SF-23, SF-25) were fitted with heavy weapons. Four ferries (SF-12, SF-14, SF-22, SF-26) were fitted with light weapons. A 70-man landing party was carried aboard three transport ferries (T-2, T-4, T-6), and allocated five of the infantry boats. There was also one headquarters and one hospital ferry.  Battle  The German ferries were escorted at a distance by MAS-526; critically, surprise was lost when they were detected by Soviet minesweeper TSch-100, which joined the battle later.http://heninen.net/aunus/english.htm Gunboat Aunus The Axis landing party landed on Sukho under the cover of the armed ferries; two of the three Soviet 100mm guns were destroyed, and the lighthouse was damaged but not taken. The landing party withdrew after sustaining casualties and losing radio contact. On the lake, multiple German ferries grounded around the island. SF-12 grounded on rocks, followed by SF-13 while attempting to assist. SF-22 grounded after being disabled by the remaining Soviet 100mm gun; SF-14 and SF-26 grounded attempting to assist. A Soviet patrol boat was damaged and retreated under a smoke screen. The arrival of Soviet gunboats and MO patrol boats forced the Axis to withdraw after having refloated SF-14 and SF-22. Soviet naval and air forces pursued but inflicted only minor damage on the retreating Germans; attacks by the Soviet motor torpedo boats TK-61 and TK-71 scored no hits, while the Germans claimed four hits on a Soviet ship. The German retreat was slowed by ferries suffering machinery failure. SF-21 was used as a rearguard; it silenced the remaining gun on Sukho but was then abandoned and scuttled - along with infantry boat I-6 - when it began to sink from leaks and pump failures.  Aftermath  The Axis suffered heavy casualties for little result, and marked the effective end of offensive Axis operations on Lake Ladoga. 17 of the 23 participating German ships were sunk or seriously damaged.http://heninen.net/laatokka-war/english.htm War on Lake Ladoga 1941‚Äì1944; four armed ferries (SF-13, SF-21, SF-12, SF-26) and one infantry boat (I-6) were lost, and SF-22 was heavily damaged. Crew and troop casualties amounted to 18 killed, 57 wounded and 4 missing. Total Soviet losses are unknown. Beyond naval losses, the Germans took six prisoners from Sukho.

It usually has two leaves at its base and one or two yellow and orange flowers with purple markings. It originally occurred in scattered populations between Tenterfield and the Hawkesbury River but because of habitat loss is now only known from the New England Tableland. Description Diuris pedunculata is a tuberous, perennial herb with two erect, linear to thread-like leaves long and wide. One or two pale yellow flowers with an orange labellum, wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is narrow egg-shaped, angled upwards, long and wide. The lateral sepals are lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long, about wide and angled downwards. The petals are narrow elliptic, long, wide, spread apart from each other and droop downwards on a dark coloured stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is broadly egg-shaped, wide and the side lobes are triangular, about long and wide. There are between two irregular ridge-like calli long at the base of the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs in August and September. Taxonomy and naming Diuris pedunculata was first described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in his Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet (pedunculata) is a Latin word meaning \\"small, slender stalk\\". Distribution and habitat The small snake orchid was originally found in scattered populations between Tenterfield and the Hawkesbury River but is now only known mostly from areas around Armidale, Uralla, Guyra and Ebor. It grows in moist, grassy places and in open forest. Similar orchids occurring in south-east New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and Tasmania have been reinterpreted as Diuris subalpina. Ecology This orchid appears use sexual deception, attracting mostly males of the native bee species, Halictus lanuginosus for pollination, even though the flowers produce nectar and emit a strong scent that attract other insects. Conservation status Diuris pedunculata is listed as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and under the New South Wales Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. The main threats to the species include habitat loss and fragmentation, grazing and trampling by livestock, weed invasion and the activities of feral pigs.

Together with Walter S√ºskind and Johan van Hulst, from around October 1942 she helped to save the lives of hundreds of Jewish infants by smuggling them into the homes of sympathetic host families. After being arrested by the Nazis in April 1943, she died in the Auschwitz concentration camp the following September. Biography Born in Amsterdam on 17 April 1876, Henri√´tte Henriquez Pimentel was the youngest daughter of the diamond cutter Nathan Henriquez Pimentel (1837‚Äì1893) and Rachel Oppenheimer (1841‚Äì1929). Together with her seven siblings, she was brought up in a well family. After following a teacher's training course, in the 1920s she worked as a governess and a kindergarten teacher in Bussum. As she had also trained as a nurse, in 1926 she was appointed director of the Vereeniging Zuigelingen- Inrichting en Kindertehuis (Cr√®che and Kindergarten Institute) in Amsterdam. Founded with support from a Jewish legacy, it was a large, well-fitted modern establishment on the Plantage Middenlaan which accommodated up to a hundred infants and toddlers who were cared for by a team of mainly Jewish staff. In 1941, as a result of the German occupation, Pimentel was forced to dismiss her non-Jewish colleagues. By autumn 1942, the cr√®che had become a hostel accommodating Jewish children whose parents were taken to the Hollandsche Schouwburg on the other side of the street. Once a theatre, it had been converted into a centre for Jews scheduled for deportation to the Westerbork transit camp. The children in the cr√®che were also to be sent to Westerbork. In collaboration with Walter S√ºskind at the Jewish Council and Johan van Hulst who ran the neighbouring teachers training college, Pimentel made arrangements for as many as possible to be smuggled out to families willing to look after them, some as far away as Friesland or Limburg. For several months, the scheme went undetected as the children's names were removed from the transport schedules. Some of them were temporarily housed in the teachers training college while others were cared for by student groups or other resistance cells. Some sources estimate that up to a thousand were saved in this way, others around 500, but the large majority continued to be deported. The operation was code-named \\"N.V.\\", short for Naamloze Vennootschap meaning \\"limited company.\\" The Nazis arrived at the cr√®che on 23 July 1943, removing all the remaining children and all the staff. Pimentel was sent first to Westerbork, then to Auschwitz where she died around 17 September 1943.

It was adjoined to four-storey building known as the Capitol Building. The Capitol Theatre was considered as one of the Singapore's finest theatres in the 1930s during that time. History In 1929, Mirza Mohammed Ali Namazie, a Persian businessman of the Namazie family, commissioned the theatre to be built in Singapore, with S. A. H. Shirazee, an Indian-Muslim merchant and community leader, and the South African brothers Joe and Julius Fisher from First National Pictures, joined in to form Capitol Theatres Ltd as its operator. Namazie would serve as the theatre company's chairman with Shirazee as director, Joe Fisher as managing director and his brother Julius Fisher as the publicity manager. =Architecture and equipments= Joe Fisher travelled overseas to acquire the materials for the theatre's furnishings, decorations and design. The Capitol Theatre was designed neoclassical architecture by British architects Keys and Dowdeswell, with its general plan, seating arrangements and lighting inspired from the Roxy Theatre in New York, United States. Builders Messrs Brossard and Mopin began construction of the foundation around July 1929. Messrs Sherwin-Williams Paint Co. in collaboration with local partner Messrs Lohmann and Co., designed the theatre's walls' and ceilings' detailing. Although installed with ventilation system, the theatre's roof was able to slide open which leave a 40-foot aperture for more ventilation. The first layout of the theatre could accommodate at least 1,600 people, with 1,100 seated on the ground floor. Another 500 seats were available at the circle that could be accessed via lifts or staircases. The seats were a few inches wider than normal British cinema seats, and the upholstery was supplied by a New York company. The theatre had a large projection room located below the balcony and ran the length of the building instead of being traditionally sited in the rear. It housed the latest Simplex projector installed with fireproof protection shutters. The theatre's acoustics and soundproofing were said to be exceptional at that time. Special expensive sound installations costing at least 40,000 Straits dollars were imported from Western Electric Company. The theatre's stage was also designed for stage productions, with changing rooms and organ chambers built into the theatre. It was also the first to equip multihued lighting system using concealed lamps with a dimmer function, which was never used in other existing theatres in Singapore at that time. Besides having the floodlit main entrance at the junction of Stamford Road and North Bridge Road, there are also two side entrances from Stamford Road and North Bridge Road, with a parking lot to accommodate at least 200 cars. There were several food outlets at the theatre. The main caf√© on the first floor had a dance floor where cabaret was held at the selected nights, and adjoining the caf√© was a restaurant known as the Capitol Restaurant. A caf√© lounge was located at the circle. A special cooling room for making French pastries was built in the kitchen on the ground floor. Its adjoined building known as Namazie Mansions, which was named after the Chairman Namazie, was completed in the early 1930. =Official Opening= In 22 May 1930, Capitol Theatre officially opened on the evening with much fanfare with musical comedy film Rio Rita, the theatre was hailed as having the most modern auditorium with the largest capacity in the Far East. Several specially prepared short films were screened to demonstrate the quality from its installed sound system. These were an overture, Capitol March, a cartoon Finding His Voice demonstrating the workings of the sound system; and the recorded inaugural announcement by the Capitol's managing director, Joe Fisher. However, during the first screening at 6.15 pm, there was a mechanical fault from the faulty sound projection, which was then corrected by the 9.15 pm show. =Operations under the Namazies= Joe Fisher, who became a pioneer in the Malayan cinema industry alongside with his brother Julius, was responsible for purchasing films' rights for the theatre, which was able to gain exclusive first-screening rights for Paramount Pictures and Universal Studios productions, along with exclusive distribution rights for Radio Pictures. The theatre would also screened the British Path√© Sound News, as well as a new film for every week. Capitol Theatre soon faced with issues, including the sudden death of Chairman Namazie in 1931, strict censorship laws and the competitions with other theatres which hurt its operations financially. In 1933, Joe and Julius Fisher started The Mickey Mouse Club to attract business. They later brought in the Marcus Show, a revue with a chorus line of 60 dancing girls, thus making the theatre and its various eateries a popular hangouts for the local youths. Early movie stars such as Charlie Chaplin, Ava Gardner, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks visited the theatre to promote their movies when they were in Singapore. In September 1939, the theatre was refurbished, seats were replaced with new upholstered ones, installed an air-conditioning system and had its vestibule redesigned and was completed by 31 January 1940. On the following day the theatre screened The Wizard of Oz to mark the occasion, and gained ahead of its competitors. In 19 December 1941, the colonial government requisitioned Capitol Theatre, which was closed after one show and also the closure of the Capitol Restaurant to serve as a food depot while the Mansions continued as the residential flats. =Operations under the Japanese= Following the Japanese Occupation of Singapore from 1942, the theatre was taken over by the Japanese to serve as a food deport and operated under the name Kyo-Ei Gekijo, its English-language movies would later be forbidden after a few months and the theatre would only screen Japanese feature and propaganda films as well as orchestras. The theatre operated until 1944, when a bomb planted by the anti-Japanese resistance fighters exploded, damaging its facade and the Mansions as well. =Operations under Shaw Organisation= After the war in 1945, Capitol Theatre and Namazie Mansions had since put under mortgage by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Later in 1946, Shaw bought over the buildings for $3 million and made the Capitol Theatre as its flagship cinema and renamed its adjoined Mansions as Shaws Building. In the late 1948, renovation of the buildings started which included repairing the damaged structure and new ballroom and restaurant known as Capitol Ballroom & Restaurant with a function room named Capitol Blue Room on the first floor. Its supposed reopening of the theatre on 30 March 1951 was delayed for 24 hours, due to the late arrival of the equipment needed for the Scandinavian Ice Revue to install the ice rink in the theatre. The theatre was officially reopened in 31 March 1951 at 9.15 pm to host the first ice show in Singapore. In 23 December 1952, the Capitol Chinese Restaurant was opened in the Capitol Blue Room in the evening, which specialised in Shanghai and Szechuan food prepared by cooks from China. From the 1951 to the 1960s, the theatre was also the venue for hosting Miss Singapore and Miss Malaya beauty pageants. The Variety show Musical Express and Singaporean musical group The Quests were held at the Capitol from the 1960s onwards. In 1978, Shaw Organisation put up Capitol Theatre and Shaws Building for sale, however no deal had been reached. Shaw Organisation later revealed plans to acquire the land of nearby Capitol Shopping Centre and to demolish Capitol Theatre and Shaws Building and redevelop the site into a shopping complex and a multiscreen cinema with commercial and residential apartments. However, under the Control of Rent Act 1953 of Singapore penal code, the Shaw Organisation had to provide compensation to its current tenants which proved a challenge to them. In February 1984, the Singapore Government gazetted the two buildings for redevelopment and later acquired the buildings from Shaw in 1987, for which the Shaw Organisation became the leasee for the use of the theatre and the building. In 1989, the theatre closed for a two-week renovation with the cost of S$700,000 with rewiring, reequipped with the new sound system and projectors and painting of the cinema hall and reopened 26 October 1989 with Lethal Weapon 2. The Shaws Building also underwent renovations and was relaunched on 30 April 1992 as the Capitol Building for commercial purposes. On 29 December 1998, the Capitol Theatre screened its last film Soldier, and was officially closed on the following day. Redevelopment In 2000, the Singapore Tourism Board took over the two buildings to explore alternative uses for it, but plans to turn it into a home for an arts group was languished and the cost of refurbishment was exorbitant. On April 3, 2008, it was reported by a spokesman for the Singapore Land Authority that the Capitol Theatre, Capitol Building, Capitol Centre and Stamford House will be redeveloped in 2009. The 4 adjoining buildings currently rest on an area of about 1.45 hectares with a total of 250 tenants, including offices and retail outlets. Tenancy with retailers along the Capitol stretch will end by May 2009, and to have their businesses relocated elsewhere. Authority had finalise the eviction notice of the timing and details for the development plan of the site, three of the buildings except for Capitol Centre have been gazetted for conservation, meaning that the buildings' facades and other architectural features must be maintained to ensure the buildings' historical integrity. In November 2011, Shimizu Corporation was awarded the redevelopment project to develop into a large scale mixed use complex called \\"Capitol Development\\". With Grant Associates working closely with the project's lead architect, Richard Meir and Partners Architects, the project consist of Singapore's largest cinema cum theatre complex, 6 stars luxury hotel & retail shops, with a total size of 21,000 m. There was also a shopping component named Capitol Piazza and residential component named Eden Residences Capitol built on the former site of the Capitol Centre. The movie theatre operator Golden Village had entered into the partnership with Capitol Investment for movie blockbuster premieres, and had installed servers and projectors to the theatre. =Reopening= The redevelopment of the Capitol Singapore complex had since completed and its topping out ceremony was held in 3 April 2014. The Capitol Theatre was reopened in 19 May 2015 after the 17 years hiatus with the world premiere of Singapura: The Musical.

According to the Counterfeiting Intelligence Bureau's International Anti-Counterfeiting Directory, SICPA provides more than 85% of the world's currency inks. The company is also involved in the market for secure traceability of products subject to excise duties, such as alcohol and tobacco stamps, and regulated products, such as halal products. A highly secretive company, SICPA employs roughly 3,000 employees and has offices and manufacturing sites in 30 countries worldwide.  History  = Beginnings = The company was founded in 1927 by Maurice Amon (1880‚Äì1959) in Lausanne to sell Swiss agricultural products, at that time primarily milk and cream, after Amon invented a new type of milking grease that facilitated the milking process. SICPA quickly moved to inks for printers to serve the growing demand in the Lausanne region. After World War II, Maurice Amon's sons Albert (1916‚Äì2010) and Salvador (1912‚Äì1993) directed the company towards sophisticated inks with characteristics that deter counterfeiting. In 1948, the Spanish 100 Peseta note was the first in the world to be printed using SICPA's security ink. In 1952, SICPA established a joint venture in Lausanne with Gualtiero Giori, an Italian printing specialist. In 1965, Giori founded a company with a British competitor firm, De La Rue, the world's oldest printer of banknotes. = Worldwide expansion = Since then, the company has extended its worldwide market reach. In 1982, the company won a contract from the US Bureau of Engraving and Printing to provide the ink for the US Dollar. In 1987, the first bank note using OVI colour-changing ink was issued in Thailand. The firm also supplied the inks for the new Euro notes in 2002. That same year, SICPA acquired the security ink segment of American company Flint Ink. SICPA's factory relocated to Chavornay in 1990. The company underwent restructuring in 1996 following a failed investment in Australia. As a result, two Swiss banks, the Soci√©t√© de banque suisse (SBS) et la Banque cantonale vaudoise (BCV), took partial control of the firm, Albert Amon retired, and his sons Philippe and Maurice joined the board of directors. In 2001, SICPA entered the market for authentication and traceability solutions through the launch of a \\"Product Safety\\" division, offering anti-counterfeit solutions and improving the collection of taxes on products such as tobacco, alcohol and currently also Medical cannabis. Three years later, in 2004, the first track and trace contract was signed with the government of Malaysia. Other contracts were signed for tobacco tracing in California (2005) and Massachusetts (2010), Brazil (2007 and 2010 for beer and tobacco), Turkey (2007), Morocco (2010) and Kenya (2013). SICPA also used to be active in the production of packaging inks, but sold that business to German company Siegwerk in 2005 for an undisclosed amount. The acquisition made Siegwerk the second largest manufacturer of packaging ink in the world. SICPA acquired the production unit of Italian company Olivetti I-Jet in 2014, after having already purchased the R&D; unit the year before. It is also present in Ecuador. Also in 2014, SICPA acquired Cabot Security Materials Inc., based out of Albuquerque, New Mexico. With cannabis becoming legal in several US states for medical purposes, SICPA introduced its cannabis tracking program to the US, notably in California.  Organization  = Key figures = A secretive company, SICPA does not publicly communicate its business figures (number of employees, offices, location of the latter etc.). However, the firm's turnover was estimated to be $750 million in 2003. Its employees are estimated to have increased from 1,100 to 3,000 between 2007 and 2013 due to several acquisitions, 400 of which work at the company headquarters in Prilly. Resulting from internal reshuffling of two of its tracing business units, an estimated 100 employees have been made redundant since 2014. A \\"reorganization plan\\" affected 150 employees in 2017. = Governance = From 2000 to 2003, Jean Daloglou was the CEO of the group. From 2003 to 2005 the position was held by Jan Secher. SICPA is now owned and managed by Philippe Amon, his brother Maurice Amon having left the company. = Business segments = The company's activities are divided into three main segments: * Inks and security technologies are the historical core business of the company, and focus on banknotes, ID documents, postage stamps, security labels, etc. The firm cooperates with the central banks of most countries. * The company offers product and brand protection solutions and services to the industry to ensure the integrity of the supply chain. This includes integrated and multi-layer authentication solutions, burglar-proof solutions as well as identification and traceability solutions. * The company has been providing integrated security solutions for governments since 2004. Secure traceability consists in providing a secure stamp or affixing a direct mark on products subject to excise duties, such as tobacco, alcohol or oil. This enables countries to combat tax evasion and smuggling, and plays a role in public health considerations. SICPA has developed a set of multilayer or multi-level security solutions that integrate visible and invisible physical security, and digital security with serialization (SICPATRACE). Each year, 76 billion products are marked with SICPA inks according to the company in 2017.  Controversies  A highly secretive company, SICPA has been regularly quoted by both media and politicians for either potential corruption practices (Brazil, Kenya and Morocco) or some of its lobbying practices (France, Ecuador), but has never been sentenced for any wrongdoing. = Americas = In 2015, the company was accused in Brazil in an investigation by the federal police concerning the conditions under which it was awarded the contract by Casa da Moeda. Charles Nelson Finkel, reportedly paid bribes of $32 million to finance ministry officials to secure the contract worth several billion euros. As of 2018, the case is still pending. Casa da Moeda has since elaborated on the contract award conditions in a note detailing the tendering procedure and the contract with SICPA was canceled. SICPA claims to have committed no irregularities and to be cooperating fully with the authorities. The Brazilian government continues to work with the company, particularly for the tracing of tobacco products (SCORPIOS contract), which was extended in 2017. = Kenya = In 2016, SICPA was criticized in Kenya for the way it obtained a public contract in 2012. Raila Odinga, former Prime Minister of Kenya, accused SICPA of \\"illegally obtaining a contract for more than one 100 million Swiss francs from the Nairobi Finance Department (Kenya Revenue Authority, KRA).\\" La Tribune de Gen√®ve also reports that according to the Kenyan press SICPA \\"had obtained the contract well before it was added into the Kenyan trade register. It also did not meet the authorities' criteria.\\" However, the Swiss newspaper also points out that \\"there is no document to support a possible malpractice in Kenya [and that] KRA is very satisfied with the services provided by SICPA\\". However, SICPA denied irregularities, insisting that the contract was awarded fairly. In a parliamentary hearing, Maurice Juma, director of Kenya's Public Procurement Oversight Authority (PPOA), said that \\"Under the procurement law, the contract was processed through fraudulent means and it cannot be sustained\\". However, SICPA received a temporary relieve when the PPOA attested the tender procedures prior to the awarding of the contract a \\"clean bill of health.\\" In 2018, Kenya's High Court ruled that the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) had not adequately followed constitutional provisions in terms of public consultation when imposing excise duties on bottled water, juices, soda and other non-alcoholic beverages. The contract the KRA had with SICPA for the supply of the duty stamps was annulled, but KRA appealed the ruling and on 11 May received permission to continue the implementation of the excise goods system.

His work encompasses drawing, painting, digital graphics, large-scale wallpainting and modular sculpture. From 1990-2012 his principle creative output was graffiti writing; he is known for graffiti works under the pseudonym Toast. People ‚Äì man ‚Äì are central to his recent digital works.Bozaci Studio  Life and Work  Bozaci grew up in a working-class Turkish family. His drawing talent was already recognised in primary school. From 1990-1991 he undertook a foundation course at an art and design school. From 1992-1996 he studied in the graphics department at the Schule f√ºr Gestaltung (Design School), Bern. For his graduation work he made the first ever sprayed comic. His desire to connect graffiti with graphics almost cost him his place studying. In 1992 he was invited to take part in a group exhibition with H. R. Giger at Art Frankfurt. In 1995 he designed the artwork for hip-hop band Fettes Brot‚Äôs album ‚ÄòAuf einem Auge bl√∂d‚Äô. Further graphic commissions followed within the Bernese club and cultural scene, including a collaboration with the cult magazine SODA. Bozaci graduated from his graphic design course when he was 22 and started working freelance in Bern. He produced 15 skateboard designs for Intersport in collaboration with the graphic design studio B√ºro Destruct. While Bozaci was an intern at Springer & Jacoby in Hamburg he developed a close friendship with Mirko Reisser DAIM / getting-up. In 2001 they and other artists realised a 2000 m2 graffiti installation opposite Hamburger Harbour wharf, on the exterior wall of the Blohm + Voss shipyard at Dock 10, entitled ‚ÄòDas neue Hamburg und seine Partnerst√§dte‚Äô (The New Hamburg and its Twin Cities).Hamburg und die Welt als Riesen-Gem√§lde im Hafen.

In: Hamburger Abendblatt. Nr. 86 vom 11. April 2001, S. 15. In 2007 Bozaci was awarded his own colour by spray-paint producer Molotow, called ‚ÄòTOAST signal black‚Äô. = Artistic career = In the late 1990s Bozaci established the company Atalier Visual Entertainment with business partners Remy Burger and Patric Geissb√ºhler, concentrating on online game commissions.Alain Lain Schibli: Interview in: Amateur Magazine, 2012 (english) They became the most successful firm in their sector, with Die Mobiliar, Swiss Dairy Producers and the Swiss Post among their clients. In 2004 Atalier won Bronze in the Swiss Dialogue Marketing Prize. By 2007 Bozaci left Atalier in order to work purely as an artist. The art collector Gunter Sachs invited Bozaci, alongside Basel graffiti writer Dare, to design his apartment at the Schlosshotel Velden. Linked by the title ‚ÄòPoint of View‚Äô, the artists painted six immersive pictures which merge into one complete image from just a few points of view.Matthias Raaflaub: Von Berner Graffitis zu Z√ºrcher Kunst. In: Der Bund, 1. Februar 2010 The work was illustrated in full in the Architectural Digest (AD) magazine. For the special exhibition ‚ÄòDie Kunst ist weiblich‚Äô about Gunter Sachs‚Äô life and work at the Museum der bildenden K√ºnste (Fine Art Museum) in Leipzig, Bozaci realised a large-scale picture on steel. Bozaci's collaboration with the Galerie Springmann from Freiburg began in 2008. Group exhibitions followed with Dare, Stefan Strumbel and the street art pioneer Blek le Rat. Two works from Gunter Sachs‚Äô collection, ‚ÄòSatan in Heaven ‚Äôand ‚ÄòBlack devil‚Äô sold well above their estimates at Sotheby's auction house in London in 2012. In 2014 two further Bozaci works were auctioned at Karl&Faber; in Munich. Point of view, apartment in Schloss Velden, 2007 = Private life = From early on Bozaci travelled widely in Europe. Thanks to his contact with the US street artist Dave Pursue, he was able to work with the skateboard company Osiris in San Diego. He criss- crossed Mexico with the rock band ‚Äòdisidente‚Äô. Two months in Cuba and numerous inspirational trips to Australia, China, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore followed. Bozaci lives in Zurich with his wife and daughter.  Works  = Graffiti = Bonedog, 1997 The works Bozaci produced between 1990 and 1996 under the alias Toast were marked by cartoonish figures. Although he began spraying lettering, for a long time Bozaci was recognised as one of the most important graffiti figure sprayers. His signature approach was to make marks that do not reveal how they were made using the simplest means.Stefan Altorfer-Ong: Black Ink / Illustrations by Ata ¬´Toast¬ª Bozaci, Publikat Verlag, = Letter Architecture = Black devil, 2003 The ‚ÄòLetter Architecture‚Äô series was ongoing from 1996-2008. These works were characterised by the use of heightened perspective, resulting in immersive works in which the letters merge with their architecture. = Modular Sculptures = Bozaci adapted a characteristic property of graffiti writing ‚Äì the intuitive inscription of letters in a space. Various basic forms, such as a rectangle, triangle and circle, became the building blocks of his sculptural writing. These are large, multi-part figures that could equally be models for futuristic buildings. ‚ÄòFor me graffiti and architecture are closely linked. For that reason, a move into tangible objects is logical.‚ÄôYann Cherix: Kunst aus dem Kokon. In: Tages-Anzeiger, 1.03.2012 In 2011 ‚ÄòMLS Modular Letter System‚Äô made from modular sculptural elements was shown at ‚ÄòThe First Beijing International Design Triennial‚Äô in the National Museum of China. = Hype Balloon = Hype Balloon, 2012 In 2011 Bozaci designed a large inflatable sculpture. The word HYPE is repeatedly blown up, only to collapse in on itself again. During the Grafik 12 exhibition Bozaci orchestrated a performance using the balloon: disguised as a graffiti sprayer he sprayed his own work and was ultimately taken away by police. = Linear and Digital Portraits = Der Boxer, 2013 Mila, 2017 Bozaci took up boxing in the early 2000s. From this experience emerged the solo exhibition ‚ÄòLineares Boxen‚Äô at The Trace Gallery in Zurich in 2013. From this period onwards Bozaci's works have become more socio-critical. His attitude to social media was visible in the 2015 travelling exhibition ‚ÄòFifteen Seconds of Fame‚Äô. He transformed acquaintances‚Äô facebook profile images into iconic portraits using digital technology. The faces are based on circle shapes. Bozaci views the perfection of a circle as emblematic of the current desire for beauty, with Facebook being the ideal place to manifest vanity and narcissism. Viewed from close up, only graphic forms can be comprehended in the portraits. Seen from a greater distance, a nearly photorealistic image emerges. Bozaci also subsequently painted digitally-created portraits as murals, among them a portrait of the Turkish writer Enis Batur. The five-metre tall picture was realised in collaboration with RAWCUT Design Studio and students from the Bomonti Mimar Sinan University in Istanbul.Ata Bozaci: Fifteen Seconds of Fame Bozaci's largest mural to date can be seen in Shenzhen, China.

Her parents were Ra√∫l Lugo Montero, born in La Vela de Coro, Falc√≥n State, and Prefect of the Maracaibo District around 1950. Her mother was Dalia Emilia Gonz√°lez Palmar de Lugo, born in Maracaibo. She went to primary school in Caracas. She started High School in the United States and finished it in Maracaibo at \\"Colegio de la Presentaci√≥n, where she graduated with honors.Nagel Von Jess, Kurt, ‚ÄúAlgunas familias maracaiberas‚Äù (Some of the Maracaibo families), University of Zulia press, Maracaibo, Venezuela, 1989. She died in Maracaibo, on September 23, 2017. Her remains rest in the church \\"Padre Antonio Mar√≠a Claret\\" in Maracaibo. She is survived by her son Luis Eduardo Giusti Lugo and her daughters Mar√≠a Elena Giusti Lugo and Claudia Giusti Lugo.  AZUPANE-Lagunillas  Lugo arrives at the East Coast of Lake Maracaibo in the late sixties. By that time Special Education was an unknown field and, as a consequence, it was not included in the educational programs of any public or private school. Disabled children were kept in their homes by their parents, without any interaction in society.\\"Azupane Lagunillas\\", article published in \\"Shell Occidental\\", monthly local Venezuelan Shell oil Company magazine, June 1975 edition. Lugo perceived this situation soon after her arrival in Lagunillas and started a crusade to claim attention on the problem. This is how the idea of creating a place for children with disabilities was born. She decided to start a campaign in order to found a school, where disabled children could be educated, play sports and have an active life outdoors. Betty Lugo in the gardens of AZUPANE-Lagunillas Press review of AZUPANE-Lagunillas on its inaugural event. Next to the Bishop of Cabimas, Mose√±or Ram√≠rez Roa, stands Betty Lugo, president and founder of the charity institution = The project = Thanks to her skills on special education she succeeded in persuading ladies within local oil society to be part of a committee, in order to collect funds for the project. She also achieved that foreign oil corporations, operating in that part of the country, accepted to include the project into their donation programs. AZUPANE- Lagunillas started on May 4, 1974, in a building with large gardens donated by Venezuelan Shell Company. A school bus was lately donated by the business community, to be used for the transportation of the students to the school. = Legacy = AZUPANE- Lagunillas made the society of that part of Venezuela aware of the importance of special education. Lugo continued her crusade encouraging public and private bodies and corporations to start more projects on special education. When she left the oil district the school was fully settled, increasing the number of students every year. The local society had become aware of the situation of children in need of special education and the Ministry of Education envisioned similar projects. The school became lately part of the government special education program, which was developed after AZUPANE-Lagunillas and lately extended throughout that region of Venezuela.

In the beginning of the 1980s Betty Lugo lived in Maracaibo. During the years she lived in that city she began a project to help people suffering depression and bipolar disorder. Due to the complexity and relative misinformation of the causes of the disease, giving advice on how to cope with it was considered essential by Lugo. This motivated her to form a psychological and medical group and to create an association dedicated to help people suffering this type of disorder.\\"Asociaci√≥n ofrece herramientas para mejorar estado de √°nimo de los Zulianos\\" (Association offers tools to improve the mood of the people of el Zulia), Betty Lugo interviewed by Maracaibo newspaper \\"La Verdad\\", published on May 27, 2006. In 2006 she founded in Maracaibo the ‚ÄúAssociation Zuliana para la Depresion y el Trastorno Bipolar, AZUDEBI (Zulia Association to treat Depression and Bipolar Disorder, AZUDEBI), which was the first initiative in this field in the State of Zulia. It was created as a charity association for providing education, guidance and treatment to people with mood disorders. = Activities = Her goal as president of AZUDEBI was to succeed every case through suitable support, permanent guidance to family members and administration of specific medical treatments. Together with these practices she started a media campaign to raise awareness about the disease.AZUDEBI monthly program activities for the association, March 2013. Betty Cecilia Lugo supervises food and medicines ditribution, at \\"La Casa de la Misericordia\\" in Maracaibo AZUDEBI based its activities on conferences for the patients and their families, which took place in community buildings, local churches and clinics involved in the project. Professionals in medicine, psychology and psychoanalysis led the discussions and reviewed relevant subjects such as the usefulness of meditation exercises, the appropriate treatment for depression and the importance of the environment and family life of the patients. Headquarters of \\"La Casa de la Misericordia\\" in Maracaibo  Casa de la Misericordia (House of Mercy)  During the years Lugo lived in Maracaibo she carried out extensive work as a co-founder of the charity association, \\"La Casa de la Misericordia\\". This charity started in 1992, within the school building of \\"Colegio de la Presentaci√≥n\\". It was founded together with the well-known catholic nun \\"Sister Francisca\\", with the aim of providing free medical care as well as spiritual support.\\"Zulianos honored Sister Francisca\\", article published in the Maracaibo newspaper \\"Panorama\\", November 16, 2015. Lugo was a key player in the acquisition of a residency that lately became the headquarters of the association. She managed to get from the Government of Zulia State the donation of the house where \\"La Casa de la Misericordia\\" is currently located. She also made possible that the oil state company ‚ÄúPetr√≥leos de Venezuela‚Äù PDVSA donated a bus to transport elderly people to the care center, as well as to patients with difficulties to walk or requiring wheelchairs. The new headquarters allowed ‚ÄúCasa de la Misericordia‚Äù to help a greater number of people in the fields of general medicine, pediatrics, gynecology, psychiatry, psychology, acupuncture and legal advice. Lugo remained an active benefactress of \\"La Casa de la Misericordia\\" for 25 years, until her death in September 2017.

It was named after the Hesse city of Hanau. Hanauer Stra√üe 10  Geographical location  Hanauer Stra√üe branches from Dachauer Stra√üe, opposite the Westfriedhof, as an extension of the Orpheusstra√üe to the north. It crosses the Georg-Brauchle- Ring after about 400 meters. After crossing this road, it connects to the Lassallestra√üe.  Development  = Former development = The area of the Moosach gasworks of Stadtwerke M√ºnchen extended between Hanauer Stra√üe, Georg- Brauchle-Ring and the Borstei. Here, between 23 April 1909 and 20 March 1967, the town gas was generated through gasification of hard coal. During this time around 15 million tonnes of coal were processed. It also produced about 500,000 tonnes of tar and tar oil as by-products. Until 1975, the site was further used for gas processing before the plant was shut down. A large part of the area was contaminated by tar and tar oil, which had seeped underground during the period in which the gas works operated. After many years vacant, the demolition of the buildings took place in 1992. Since mid-2005, Europe's largest funnel-and-gate system, a passive cleaning process, has been in operation there. The plant is designed for over 350 m¬≥ / h of water, which is loaded with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Hanauer Stra√üe was the location of the Olympic press city in 1972. = Current development = At Hanauer Stra√üe 10/10a, 12/12a and 14/14a, the Lehrkolonie Moosach (teaching colony) was built in 1919 by the Bayerische Landessiedlung. Three semi- detached houses, single-family small-house buildings in country house style, served as experimental buildings for the testing of alternative building materials. Today these buildings are cultural monuments under the Bavarian monument protection law. At Hanauer Stra√üe 54, stands the Evangelical Methodist Church of the Redeemer; the Moosach town library is at Hanauer Stra√üe 61a. The area to the north of Pelkovenstra√üe is one of Bavaria's major retail centers, characterized by commercial enterprises and multi-storey residential buildings: east of the city, the Mona (7,700 m¬≤ retail space) and the Olympia-Einkaufszentrum (Olympia shopping center] (56,000 m¬≤ retail space) border Hanauer Stra√üe. Across the street are more retail spaces, each with sales floorspace of several thousand square meters (for example Conrad Electronic and Saturn Hansa stores, a furniture store and a medical center). = Future development = East of the southern part of Hanauer Stra√üe a bus depot and a six-storey office building are being built on the site of the former gasworks. To the south of this is a neighborhood with about 600 apartments for 1,350 people, two day-care centers and a primary school. This is then grouped around the buildings of the Lehrkolonie Moosach.  Public transport  Located on Hanauer Stra√üe are the underground stations Georg- Brauchle-Ring (U1) and Olympia-Einkaufszentrum (U1/U3), at the junction with the Dachauer Stra√üe the tram stop Hanauer Stra√üe tram line 20/N20.  Events  Scene of the attack Flower laying The Hanauer Stra√üe was the main location of an attack in Munich on 22 July 2016. Five people died in a McDonald's restaurant, two more on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant and another in close proximity. The perpetrator crossed Hanauer Stra√üe and killed another man on the east side of Hanauer Stra√üe in the Olympia shopping center. At number 77, the top of Hanauer Stra√üe, between McDonald's and Saturn, a memorial is to be inaugurated for the first anniversary of the act: A ten-meter-high ginkgo tree is covered by a two-meter-high and 2.5-meter-wide ring of polished stainless steel, part of the ring is sunk in the ground and allows entry.

History The design of the E.583 goes back to the E.581, an earlier project by Arado, in which design variants for a single-beam, tailless night fighter were also examined. The starting point for the E.581 was again the studies in connection with the project E.555 for a multi-beam long-range bomber. However, due to the long inlet and the large hull surface, the Heinkel HeS-011 jet engine of the E.581, which was integrated into the fuselage, could only expect inadequate performance in the high-speed sector. Arado then created two new project designs in accordance with the guidelines issued in January 1945 for the optimal solution of a night fighter. Under the overall designation E.583, the studies Ar-I and Ar-II - also referred to as Project I and II - were presented at the same time. The Ar-I was based on the draft E.581-5, but had much larger dimensions. The experts criticized on 20./21. March 1945 again the resistance generating engine intakes and large surfaces. Arado then improved the design so that a third crew member and a larger amount of fuel could be included. A third variant received smaller and more swept wings. Allegedly, it is said to have served as inspiration for the US Vought F7U-3 Cutlass. However, head of the aerodynamic research department of Vought, William C. Schoolfield, denied that any orientation towards German research has taken place. Jim Winchester: F7U Cutlass. International Air Power Review Vol. 15, S. 100. The Ar-II was regarded as an easier to implement night fighter. The design had swept wings and was strongly based on the Arado Ar 234 and the study TEW 16 / 43-23. The maximum speed was calculated at 775 km / h, lower than that of the Ar-I. Construction The Ar I was designed as a tailless aircraft, in which the ailerons also served as horizontal stabilizer. The two rudders were each placed on top of the wings. Technical Data Dan Johnson: Ar I auf luft46.com, abgerufen am 28.

It originally aired on March 28, 2018 in the United States on FX. Plot In the three years between 1984 and 1987, Philip has become a full-time travel agent running an expanded Dupont Circle Travel, Henry attends boarding school and plays hockey, and Paige attends George Washington University in D.C. and is a Soviet agent in training (and also is practicing Russian by watching a Soviet movie with Elizabeth and Claudia). Stan has married Renee and has moved out of FBI counterintelligence except for the now-married Sofia and Gennadi (whom he still handles with his ex-partner Dennis Aderholt, the new head of counterintelligence), while Elizabeth is exhausted and resentful from handling a full KGB case load nine weeks before the Reagan-Gorbachev summit in D.C. (December 8‚Äì10, 1987), with most of her work focused on the summit. Claudia informs Elizabeth that she has been ordered by certain unknown parties in the Center to travel to Mexico City and meet with General Kovtun of the Soviet Strategic Rocket Forces, who tells her about \\"Dead Hand\\" (a doomsday device) and the Soviet military's plan to overthrow Gorbachev if he renounces it. Kovtun asks Elizabeth to spy on Soviet negotiator Fyodor Nesterenko, who is meeting with American negotiator Glenn Haskard (whom Elizabeth is monitoring as \\"Stephanie\\", a home health care aide for his wife Erica, a terminally ill artist). Kovtun also gives Elizabeth a cyanide pill to take if captured. Meanwhile in the USSR, Arkady, now deputy chief of Directorate S and a Gorbachev supporter, recruits Oleg, now married (with a son) and out of the KGB (but also a Gorbachev supporter), to travel to the US and ask Philip to uncover (and possibly stop) Elizabeth's unapproved new mission; due to internal Soviet opposition to Gorbachev within the Center, Arkady cannot trust his own officers with this task. After arriving in D.C., Oleg signals Philip and then meets with him, telling Philip that he will stay in D.C. (without official cover) to await Philip's answer. While Paige is on a surveillance detail, a young U.S. security officer tries to coerce her for a date by taking her (fake) college ID. Elizabeth then kills him and recovers the ID. That night, when Philip tries to tell Elizabeth about Oleg's visit and points out the emotional toll of her job, she rudely dismisses him. Production The episode was written by Joel Fields and series creator Joe Weisberg and directed by Chris Long. The Soviet movie watched by Paige, Elizabeth, and Claudia in the episode was the 1980 Academy Award winner for Best Foreign Language Film, Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Dead Hand\\" was seen by an estimated 642,000 household viewers and gained a 0.14 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. \\"Dead Hand\\" received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has a 100% approval rating with an average score of 9.8 out of 10 based on 14 reviews, with the consensus stating: \\"Tensions mount in 'Dead Hand,' an unusually fast-paced installment that barrels toward the show's seemingly inevitable endgame.\\" The A.V. Club gave the episode a perfect A grade. Alan Sepinwall from Uproxx reviewed it positively saying, \\"'Dead Hand' wastes little time in establishing just how bad the conclusion could be for all involved.\\"  References  External links * \\"Dead Hand\\" at FX * Category:The Americans (season 6) episodes Category:2018 American television episodes ","title":"Dead Hand (The Americans)"},{"id":"56973640","text":"was a private junior college in Mishima, Shizuoka, Japan.

She was one of the first women in Canada to establish an architectural firm. She is also considered to be Edmonton's first female architect.  Biography  Born in Toronto, Ontario to a well-to-do family, Imrie's parents moved to Edmonton, Alberta when she was three years old. Her father was John M. Imrie, an Edmonton newspaper publisher who won a Pulitzer prize. She first studied architecture at the University of Alberta and then at the University of Toronto, studying under Eric Arthur and graduating in 1944.Wallbridge & Imrie at The Canadian Encyclopedia, accessed September 4, 2019 From 1946-1949, she worked for the city of Edmonton as a draftsman, along with her future partner Jean Wallbridge. While there, the municipality sent both of them to Europe to study post-war reconstruction methods. In 1950, Imrie and Wallbridge formed a business partnership in Edmonton, working together until 1979, the time of Wallbridge's death. They built mostly homes that were known for their elegant yet modern lines. They were also able to procure several commercial contracts, such as elementary schools and housing for senior citizens. In 1957, their firm won a Canadian Housing Design Council award. Despite the high caliber of their work, as female architects they had a harder time obtaining larger commissions. Women in that era were often regulated to the less lucrative residential or interior design markets. Imrie and Wallbridge also traveled extensively, visiting several continents, and writing about their experiences for a journal owned by the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada. Concerning her professional work, Imbrie stated, \\"It was a grind, in a cold hard world. But I would like to add, it was also satisfying and a lot of fun!\\" She was a member of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada and the Alberta Association of Architects. A travel grant is named after her at The University of Alberta, called the \\"Mary Louise Imrie Graduate Student Award\\". Interested by Alberta's natural landscapes, Imrie bequeathed the bulk of her estate to the Parks Venture Fund of Alberta. She donated her home, the \\"Imirie House\\", as well as the land located next to the North Saskatchewan River.
